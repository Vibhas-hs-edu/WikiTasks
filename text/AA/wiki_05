Paul Bourdarie

Paul Bourdarie (19 July 1864 – 21 February 1950) was a French explorer, journalist, lecturer and professor. 
He became known as a specialist in colonial topics and gave lectures on subjects such as growing cotton and domesticating African elephants.
He believed in a liberal policy regarding the indigenous people of the French colonies.
Bourdarie was one of those responsible for founding the Grand Mosque of Paris.
Early years (1864–94).
Paul Bourdarie was born on 19 July 1864 in Montfaucon, Lot.
In 1893 he left on a study mission in the Congo.
His report described the culture of the lime growers of Gabon, the need to establish experimental farms, and construction of a port at Pointe-Noire that would be the terminus of the railway from Brazzaville.
To avoid using porters at a time when tractors had not yet been invented he advocated domestication of African elephants.
The problems of rubber collection that he described caused the Minister of the Colonies and the Museum to import "Hevea brasiliensis" to Guinea, Ivory Coast and Dahomey, and "Palaquium gutta" to Gabon.
African Society (1894–97).
From 1894 to 1897 Bourdarie was secretary general of the Société africaine de France (African Society of France) founded by Admiral Vallon and Doctor Verrier.
In 1895 he was candidate for the Gabon-Congo delegation to the French Africa Committee, representing the colonists, and raised questions about Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza's approach to colonization.
In 1897, in "La France Noire", Bourdarie acknowledged Brazza's honesty and his contribution to the French Congo colony but opposed his appointment as Commissioner General of the colony on the basis of his lack of tact and the opposition he had raised among the colonists,
In 1895 the Algerian Arab interpreter Djebari claimed that survivors from the Flatters expedition were still being held prisoner by the Tuaregs at the oasis of Taoua.
A committee of African experts was formed to examine these claims.
It included Colonel Ludovic de Polignac, who had helped to negotiate the Ghadames treaty of 1862; Jean-Marie Bayol, former Lieutenant-Governor of Dahomey; the explorers Gaston Donnet, Bernard d'Attanoux and Ferdinand de Béhagle; and Paul Bourdarie.
Bourdarie and Ferdinand de Béhagle made speeches to the Société africaine de France in which they stressed the importance of the French colonists making a military "association" with the natives for defense of the colonies.
Bourdarie prepared the Chad expedition of Ferdinand de Béhagle, who was hanged in 1899 in Dikoa by the order of Rabih az-Zubayr.
Bourdarie then undertook the repatriation of the mission of Béhagle and Albert Bonnel de Mézières().
In the course of this mission he proposed construction of railway around the Bangui rapids.
Journalist and lecturer (1897–1908).
In 1896 Bourdarie succeeded Béhagle in taking charge of the "Colonies and Protectorates" column in the newspaper "La France", where he wrote a personal column "The art of colonizing."
From 1896 to 1898 Bourdarie gave lecture tours on the domestication of elephants in Africa.
After a lecture tour in Belgium he was received on 25 May 1898 by Leopold II, who charged Captain Laplume to inquire on the trials of domesticating elephants undertaken at Fernan Vaz by the Fathers of the Holy Spirit.
In 1904–1905 he talked in the French textile industry centers on establishing cotton cultivation in Africa.
In 1906 Bourdarie founded the "Revue indigène" to promote a liberal policy for treatment of indigenous people.
The "Revue indigène: Organe des intérêts des ineligènes aux colonies et pays de protectorat" was published in Paris from 1906 to 1932 under his direction.
It advocated respect for the institutions and authorities of the colonized societies, gradual modernization at their own pace through collaboration between traditional elites and the colonial authorities, with progressive granting of political rights including the vote and French citizenship, while letting the colonized peoples retain their traditional laws, customs and culture.
The periodical was read by many North African Muslims.
Professor (1908–20).
In 1908 Bourdarie was appointed professor at the Collège libre des sciences sociales() (Free College of Social Sciences) under the direction of Ernest Delbet().
Until 1914 he taught courses on the history and sociology of French Equatorial Africa.
In 1909 Bourdarie and Professor Paul Pellet of the École des Sciences Politiques founded the "Souvenir colonial français" to create bronze plates that marked the deeds of the French overseas.
In 1910 he made a trip to Tunisia, where the "Revue indigène" was read by many of the Tunisians as an alternative to the propaganda of the "colons".
From 1914 to 1920 he lectured on current events, politics and "the colonial lessons of war".
In 1915 Bourdarie originated the project to found the Grand Mosque of Paris with an associated Muslim Institute.
At the invitation of the Resident General he made a trip to Morocco in 1916 and visited Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakesh, Fez, Taza, Mazagan and Safi.
Other activities (1919–50).
Bourdarie was general delegate of the Association cotonnière coloniale() (Colonial Cotton Association) from 1917 to 1921.
In 1919 he was chairman of the League of Nations Division for Colonial and Foreign Affairs and supported the independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia from Russia.
In 1920 Bourdarie was appointed to the Conseil supérieur des Colonies.
At this time Bourdarie, Governor Alfred Albert Martineau and Maurice Delafosse began the process of creating the Académie des sciences coloniales (Academy of Colonial Sciences), now the Académie des sciences d’outre-mer() (Academy of overseas sciences).
On 8 July 1922 he was appointed permanent secretary of the Academy.
In 1928 Bourdarie was decorated as Officer of Public Instruction.
In 1929 he was appointed to the Transaharian Railway Study Committee.
In 1930 he was a member of the Higher Council of the Exposition coloniale internationale (Paris Colonial Exposition).
In 1938 he was appointed to the Upper Scientific Committee of the French Institute of Black Africa.
In 1939 Bourdarie was awarded the grand prize of the Académie française.
During World War II Bourdarie continued the work of the Académie des sciences coloniales in 1939–40, moved to his house at Veyrac when the Germans advanced, then returned to Paris.
In 1943, at the age of 79, he resigned from his position as permanent secretary of the Academy and returned to Veyrac, where he lived until his death on 21 February 1950.
Publications.
Bourdarie published many articles, reports and speeches. A selection follows.

Sun Mountain Sports

Sun Mountain Sports, often referred to simply as Sun Mountain, is an American manufacturer of golf equipment based in Missoula, Montana. Since its founding in 1981, the company has introduced several innovations in golf equipment, such as lightweight golf bags, the golf bag with built-in legs, golf push carts, waterproof golf bags, stretchable/waterproof golf jackets, and double-strap golf bags.
History.
Rick Reimers, a golf professional from California, first experimented with lightweight nylon golf bags in the late 1970s. At the time, golf bags were heavy, crafted from leather or vinyl. Reimers founded Sun Mountain in 1981 and moved the company to Missoula, Montana, in 1984. That same year, he produced the Front 9 model, which became the company's first commercial success. His Eclipse bag from 1986 was the first lightweight golf bag with a built-in stand.
Sun Mountain added its outerwear line in 1990. It was the first company, along with Izzo, to introduce double bag straps in the 1990s. Furthermore, it developed the first two-ply wind shirt in the United States, as well as the first golf push cart. Sun Mountain was one of the four producers that dominated the American golf bag industry in 1992.
The company created a new line of golf products with the introduction of the "Speed Cart", the first easily foldable, three-wheeled push cart, in 1999. Sun Mountain was the first golf bag brand to introduce waterproof bags in 2007.
In 2010, Sun Mountain was the biggest American maker of golf bags, with its bags accounting for 16.5 percent of the golf bag share sales in the country. It employed 140 people. By 2013, there were 200 employees.
Equipment.
Sun Mountain produces golf carry bags, cart bags, push carts, golf travel bags, and golf rainwear and outerwear. It prioritizes ease of use.
Its 2Five golf bag weighs only two and a half pounds. The C-130 cart bag and the 4.5 carry bag include integrated portable power packs to charge mobile devices. Sun Mountain patented a bag carrying system called "Zero-Gravity Technology," which transfers the weight of the bag from the shoulders to the hips.
The company has a ClubGlider golf travel case line. The best-known product of the line, the ClubGlider Meridian, is made from ballistic nylon, has two sets of wheels and a unique leg mechanism that extends and retracts, reducing 45 pounds of pressure on the arms and shoulders according to the company.
Recognition.
Sun Mountain won four Golf Digest awards for golf equipment in 2017: its 2Five bag won in the Lightweight category, the 3.5LS in Carry, the C-130 in Cart, and the 5.5LS in Hybrid. Finally, the Club Glider Meridian was chosen as the Best Travel Cover. In 2016, the company had won three awards: the C-130 in Golf Cart, the 2Five in Lightweight, and the ClubGlider Meridian in the Best Golf Travel Cover award.
Sun Mountain has been one of the National Golf Foundation's Top 100 Businesses in Golf for years.
The company provided the outerwear for the United States team at the Presidents Cup from 2011 to 2013.

Battle of In Emsal

The battle of In Emsal took place during the Tuareg rebellion of 2012. On 20 January, a Malian military convoy that came to rescue the garrison of Aguelhoc was ambushed by rebels of MLNA, and terrorists of Ansar Dine and AQIM.
The battle.
Following the attack on the town of Aguelhoc by the MNLA, Ansar Dine, and AQIM rebels, a Malian military convoy commanded by Colonel Ould Meydou, leader of a group of Arab militiamen, departed Gao on January 19 heading to Aguelhok in the North. But too confident, he did not send scouts to search the region for rebels, and the next day, 15 kilometers south of Aguel'hoc, the Malian column attacked by MLNA-Islamist coalition. The battle took place in the Wadi of In Emsal (also called Imenzad or Imezzehene). The clash lasted all day, and the Malians finally forced to turn around, carrying several wounded with them not being able to reach their, destination.
Casualties.
According to an MNLA statement issued on 22 January by Communication Officer Bakay Ag Hamed Ahmed, the Malian losses were 50 dead, 25 prisoners, 26 vehicles captured, 40 vehicles destroyed, 1 tank, and 1 BRDM. The MNLA claimed that it had only two wounded i its ranks.
Mossa Ag Attaher, another spokesman for the MNLA, responsible for media relations, gave a higher score on 21 January. According to him the Malian losses are 101 dead, 65 prisoners, 4 military trucks burned and 5 BRDM destroyed. The convoy consisted of 40 vehicles, including Toyota pick-ups equipped with machine guns, BRDMs and troop transport trucks. For its part, the Malian government recognized only a dozen deaths on its side during the battle.

Van Horne House

The Van Horne House is a historic building at 941 East Main Street near Bound Brook in Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. The house was built and also known as Phil's Hill, after its owner, Philip Van Horne. It served as the headquarters for American General Benjamin Lincoln in 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, in particular the Battle of Bound Brook. Later, it served as the headquarters for American General William Alexander, Lord Stirling during the second Middlebrook encampment (1778–79). The house, on the early-18th-century Old York Road that connected Philadelphia to New York City, was a New Jersey landmark during the war. Since 2002, the Heritage Trail Association has used the house as its headquarters, including an exhibit space. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 8, 2002, for its locally significant Colonial Revival architecture from 1937 to 1944.
History.
Between 1683 and 1685, Thomas Codrington, a merchant from New York City, purchased 2,754 acres between the Raritan River and the First Watchung Mountain from the East Jersey proprietors. In 1706, he sold the property to Phillip French, who left it to his three daughters. This tract was later split between Cornelius Van Horne, husband of Elizabeth French, and Joseph Reade, husband of Anne French, as recorded in a 1722 deed. Jacob Janeway purchased an 84-acre lot that included the site of the house, . Philip Van Horne (1719–1793), son of Cornelius, then purchased the lot from Janeway's estate in 1750.
During the French and Indian War, Philip Van Horne was a colonel in the Somerset County militia. In 1759, he was appointed a judge in the Court of Common Pleas for Somerset County. He was known for his great hospitality, to both sides of the war, and his house became known as Convivial Hall or Convivial Hill. Andrew D. Mellick, Jr. in his book, "The Story of an Old Farm", reports that Van Horne had "five handsome and well-bred daughters who were the much admired toasts of both armies." His eldest daughter, Mary Ricketts, married Irish American Colonel Stephen Moylan on September 12, 1778. American Captain Alexander Graydon (1752–1818) writes that: "His house, used as a hotel, seemed constantly full." and notes that General George Washington was concerned: Mellick writes: 
At the Battle of Bound Brook, on April 13, 1777, Van Horne hosted British General Charles Cornwallis for breakfast and American Generals Benjamin Lincoln and Nathanael Greene for supper.
During the second Middlebrook encampment (winter of 1778–79), Major General William Alexander, Lord Stirling used the house as his headquarters. Stirling took over command of the Middlebrook encampment on December 21, 1778, when Washington left to meet with Congress in Philadelphia, until he returned about February 5, 1779. General Henry Lee, Light-Horse Harry, and other officers were also quartered here.
On October 26, 1779, British Lt. Col. John Graves Simcoe led a group of the Queen's Rangers to search for and capture New Jersey Governor William Livingston or Colonel Moylan. He raided several houses in Bound Brook before arriving here, but did not find his targets. After taking prisoners at the house, he continued on to Van Veghten's Bridge.
In 1934, the house was purchased by the Calco Chemical Company, later American Cyanamid. The company had previously established a large manufacturing facility on the adjoining property, starting in 1916. Starting in 1937, company executive John McMurray had the house restored, "in colonial period", to be used as corporate guest quarters. During World War II, the company noted in its April 1944 newsletter:
Description.
The house is two stories with a gable roof. The stone foundation is from the 18th century. The house was remodeled by the Calco Chemical Company between 1937 and 1944 using a 20th-century Colonial Revival style. It is on a hill north of the Old York Road and west of the Middle Brook.

Ben Nevis and Glen Coe National Scenic Area

Ben Nevis and Glen Coe is a national scenic area (NSA) covering part of the Highlands of Scotland surrounding Ben Nevis and Glen Coe, in which certain forms of development are restricted. It is one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The Ben Nevis and Glen Coe NSA covers of land, lying within the Highland, Argyll and Bute and Perth and Kinross council areas. A further of the NSA are marine, covering the sea loch of Loch Leven.
National scenic areas are primarily designated due to the scenic qualities of an area, however NSAs may well have other special qualities, for example related to culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. Glen Coe is designated as a national nature reserve, and there are several Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas within the NSA. Although the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway have current management strategies .
Creation of the national scenic area.
The idea that areas of wild or remote character such as Ben Nevis and Glen Coe should be designated to protect the scenic qualities of their landscapes grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1931 a commission headed by Christopher Addison first proposed the creation of a national park in Scotland. Following the Second World War a committee chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay to consider the issue proposed that five areas should receive a level of protection: "Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount" was one of the areas listed. The area thus became one of five designated "national park direction areas", in which planning decisions taken by local authorities could be reviewed by central government under certain circumstances.
A 1974 report by the Countryside Commission for Scotland (CCS) entitled "A Park System for Scotland" recommended that the Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount area should be designated as one of four proposed "Special Parks", considering the area of national importance due to its natural beauty and amenity value, however this recommendation was not acted on. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, it was suggested that additional areas, alongside the existing direction areas should receive protection, and in 1981 the direction areas were thus replaced by the 40 national scenic areas, which were based on the 1978 recommendations, and included the Ben Nevis and Glen Coe area.
A further report into protection of the landscape of Scotland was published by the CCS in 1990. Entitled "The Mountain Areas of Scotland - Conservation and Management", it recommended that four areas were under such pressure that they ought to be designated as national parks, each with an independent planning board, in order to retain their heritage value. The four areas identified were similar to those proposed by the Ramsay Committee, and included Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount. The government did not however choose to establish national parks and so the status of the Ben Nevis and Glen Coe area was not altered. Following the passage of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, national parks were established in the Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, two of the areas identified by the Ramsay committee, however the status of the other three Ramsay areas, including Ben Nevis and Glen Coe, was again not altered. In 2013 the Scottish Campaign for National Parks proposed seven areas deemed suitable for national park status, one of which was the Ben Nevis and Glen Coe area.
Landscape and scenery.
Although named after Ben Nevis and Glen Coe, the national scenic area covers a much wider area of land, as detailed below. Much of the northern part of the NSA lies within the Lochaber region.
Glen Nevis.
Glen Nevis () lies in the north of the national scenic area, and runs south from Fort William. It is bordered to the south by the Mamore range, and to the north by the in the British Isles: Ben Nevis (Scotland's highest mountain), Càrn Mor Dearg, Aonach Mòr, and Aonach Beag. It is home to the second highest waterfall in Scotland, Steall Falls. Below the waterfall is a steeply walled and impressive gorge.
Mamores.
The Mamores form an east-west ridge approximately fifteen kilometres in length lying between Glen Nevis to the north and Loch Leven to the south. Ten of the ranges are classified as Munros. The hills can be accessed from both Glen Nevis and the former aluminium smelting town of Kinlochleven.
Glen Coe.
Glen Coe () is a glen of volcanic origins, in the heart of the national scenic area. A review of the national scenic areas by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2010 made reference to the "soaring, dramatic splendour of Glen Coe", and "the suddenness of the transition between high mountain pass and the lightly wooded strath" in the lower glen. It also described the journey through the glen on the main A82 road as "one of the classic Highland journeys". The main settlement is the village of Glencoe located at the foot of the glen. The glen is regarded as the home of Scottish mountaineering and is popular with hillwalkers and climbers.
Glen Etive.
Glen Etive () lies to the south of Glen Coe. The River Etive () rises on the peaks surrounding Rannoch Moor, with several tributary streams coming together at the Kings House Hotel. From the Kings House, the Etive flows for about 18 km, reaching the sea loch, Loch Etive. The river and its tributaries are popular with whitewater kayakers and at high water levels it is a test piece of the area and a classic run. Glen Etive has been used as the backdrop to many movies, among them "Braveheart" and "Skyfall".
The Black Mount.
The Black Mount is situated between Glen Orchy and Glen Coe, to the east of Glen Etive, forming the southernmost part of the national scenic area. Its four Munros are Stob Ghabhar, Stob a' Choire Odhair, Creise and Meall a' Bhuiridh. The hills of Ben Inverveigh and Meall Tairbh are located between Black Mount and the Bridge of Orchy. The Black Mount Deer Forest includes moorland, the mountain, as well as several rivers, burns, lochs, and tarns.
Rannoch Moor.
Much of the western part of Rannoch Moor (), an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, is included in the national scenic area. The A82 road crosses western Rannoch Moor on its way to Glen Coe and Fort William, as does the West Highland Line, which reaches Fort William via Glen Spean rather than Glen Coe. When the line was built across the moor, its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots, brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes. Corrour railway station, the UK's highest, and one of its most remote being from the nearest public road, is located on this section of the line at . The line takes gentle curves totalling across the moorland.
Conservations designations.
A number of other conservation designation are defined within or overlapping with the NSA: Glen Coe is designated as a both national nature reserve (NNR), and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to wide variety of montane habitats found within the glen. Glen Coe, along with most of the southwestern portion of the NSA including Glen Etive and the Black Mount, forms part of the Glen Etive and Glen Fyne Special Protection Area (SPA), which is protected due to its breeding population of golden eagles.
Rannoch Moor is also designated as an SAC, and is particularly famous as being the sole British location for the Rannoch-rush, named after the moor. It also has populations of otters and freshwater pearl mussels. The River Tay rises on the moor within the NSA, and is designated as a separate SAC for its entire length. The Ben Nevis massif is also an SAC, as are the woodlands at North Ballachulish in the westernmost part of the NSA. The final SAC within the NSA protects the woods on the western side of Loch Etive, in the southwestern extremity of the area.

He was born in Greenock on 10 August 1807. His father died when he was an infant and his widowed mother moved to Glasgow.
In 1821 at age 14 he was apprenticed to William Bennet &amp; Co, an insurance broker at 185 Exchange in the city centre. The company specialised in marine insurance for Glasgow ships.
Not until around 1840 does he appear as an independent householder, then living at 28 Abbotsford Place in Glasgow and working for Bennet &amp; Browne, an amalgamated firm now operating from 126 Queen Street. William Bennet had died of cholera in 1832 and Clouston and then been made a junior partner with James Browne, but his name never appeared in the company title.
In 1854 he became a town councillor, rising to be Lord Provost in 1860. By this time he was living at 1 Park Terrace, a very attractive five storey Victorian end-terraced house close to Kelvinside Park.
He was later Chairman of the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company
He died in Glasgow on 30 August 1888, aged 81. He is buried in the Glasgow Necropolis. The grave lies on one of the western terraces.
Artistic recognition.
Whilst in office he was portrayed by Robert Herdman.
He was also photographed by Camille Silvy.
Family.
He was married to Hannah Grant (d.1867).
His daughters married the brothers James and Matthew Bulloch of the "Bay Line" Shipping Company and Bulloch Lade &amp; Co distillers (owners of the Caol Ila distillery) respectively.

All India Services Act, 1951

The All India Services Act, 1951 (IAST: ) is an Indian legislation. The Act established two All India Services and provides for the creation of three more.
History.
During the occupation of India by the East India Company, the civil services were divided into three — covenanted, uncovenanted and special civil services. The covenanted civil service, or the Honourable East India Company's Civil Service (HEICCS), as it was called, largely consisted of British civil servants occupying the senior posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was solely introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians into the lower rung of the administration. The special service consisted of specialised departments, such as the Indian Forest Service, Indian Police and Indian Political Service, whose ranks were drawn from either the covenanted civil services or the British Indian Army. The Indian Police ranked many British Indian Army officers among its members, although after 1893, an annual exam was used to select its officers. In 1858, the HEICCS was replaced by the Indian Civil Service (ICS), which became the highest civil service in British-ruled India between 1858 and 1947. The last British appointments to the ICS were made in 1942.
With the passing of the "Government of India Act, 1919", the Imperial Services — under the oversight of the Secretary of State for India — were split into two arms, the All India Services and the Central Services. The Imperial Civil Service was one of the ten All India Services.
In 1946, at the Premier's Conference, the then-Central Cabinet decided to form the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), based on the Imperial Civil Service (ICS); and the Indian Police Service (IPS), based on the Imperial Police (IP).When India was partitioned following the departure of the British in 1947, the Imperial Civil Service was divided between the new dominions of India and Pakistan. The Indian remnant of the ICS was named the Indian Administrative Service, while the Pakistan remnant was named the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS). The modern Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service were created under the Article 312(2) in part XIV of the Constitution of India, and the "All India Services Act, 1951".
Provisions.
The Act creates two All India Services as per the article 312(2) in part XIV of the Constitution of India, namely, the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS).
The act — subject to a two-thirds majority (supermajority) in the Rajya Sabha — also provides for the creation of three more All India Services, namely, the Indian Engineering Service, the Indian Forest Service, and the Indian Medical Service. Of these, only the Indian Forest Service was created under the "All India Services Act, 1951" in 1966.
Amendments.
The "All India Services Act, 1951" has been amended four times.

Association of Road Surveyors of Scotland

Association of Road Surveyors of Scotland (1884 - 1924) was a professional society in Scotland focused on infrastructure.
History.
The Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act 1878 enhanced the profession of Road Surveyor by organising a list of statutory highways and processes of County administration. It began the move towards County-based responsibility for the roads network and bridges, assisted by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 which established County Councils.
Following the 1878 Act, in 1884, around forty Scottish road surveyors decided to form an association with the object of ‘the encouragement and advancement of all matters connected with road management, and to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas amongst its members; to fix places of meeting, and transact such other business as may be necessary’.
The first meeting of the new Association of Road Surveyors of Scotland was held in Edinburgh on 23 July 1884 with David Patrick of Dalry appointed the first President. Initially, there were 54 members. The association met annually and voted in a new President each year. There were two vice-Presidents, an Hon. Secretary and Treasurer, and Hon. Auditors. Meetings involved the reading of papers and discussion. There would also be trips to see bridges, roadworks, quarrying and new equipment in operation.
In 1888 Sir William Arrol showed the association the Forth Bridge under construction. In 1919 the Hon. Secretary and Treasurer Allan Stevenson retired after thirty-five years in the role. His position was taken by Major William Chapman of Airdrie.
In 1924 the Association decided to change their name to the Highway Engineers’ Association of Scotland. This reflected the engineering role many undertook.
In 1931 some members of the Association decided to form the Scottish County Surveyors Society. Prior to the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 most surveyors had remained as District Road Surveyors with the County role only taken on by some authorities, notably Midlothian. The Act brought in the widespread use of the County role. In 1937 the Scottish County Surveyors Society merged with the English and Welsh County Surveyors Society which had been founded in 1885.
In 1936 the Highway Engineers’ Association of Scotland decided to merge with the Institution of Municipal &amp; County Engineers. Part of the agreement required the Institution to include the phrase ‘Incorporating the Highway Engineer’s Association of Scotland’ for three years thereafter. In 1984 the Institution itself merged with the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE).

<doc id="56604075" url="?curid=56604075" title="Donor-specific antibody">
Donor-specific antibody

Antibody-mediated transplant rejection involves B cell and plasma cell activation resulting in the generation of donor-specific antibodies (DSA), which bind to HLA and/or non-HLA molecules on the endothelium. Preformed donor–specific HLA antibodies resulting in hyperacute rejection were first detected in 1969 by the complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch assay. The presence of pre-formed and de novo (newly formed) DSA, specific to donor/recipient mismatches are major risk factors for antibody-mediated rejection, which results in both acute and chronic transplant injury and is the primary cause of accelerated early and late allograft loss. Almost a third of patients who are waitlisted for transplantation may have a degree of anti-HLA antibodies detected. The usual route for sensitisation towards HLA antigens occurs in three instances; pregnancy, post blood transfusion and prior transplantation. Preformed antibodies increase the chances of immunological failure of the allograft by causing positive crossmatches and, thereby, result in the exclusion of donors. For sensitised patients, successful transplantation is possible by employing strategies such as desensitisation, paired exchange and acceptable mismatching.
Panel reactive antibody.
The degree of cytotoxicity is expressed as percentage PRA (panel reactive antibody). It is a tool that can be employed to approximate the risk of a given recipient of having a positive crossmatch. This is to a likely organ donor taken from a similar population. The limitations of this method are that PRA percent can be different numerically without a corresponding change in the type or amount of antibody. This largely depends on the cell panel used which are commercially produced and may not truly represent the population. HLA frequencies and racial differences need to be factored in but cannot be done. Moreover, significant false positive results can be produced due to non-HLA antibodies, autoantibodies and nonspecific IgM antibodies. Similarly, false negative results are possible as this is purely complement dependent that requires higher antibody titres to be activated. The lack of a complement activation simply due to low titres allows a true antibody to be hidden.
Cross-match test.
Patel and Terasaki in 1969 demonstrated the efficacy of complement-dependent lymphocytotoxic cross-match in defining immunologic risk in renal transplantation. This became the standard method, still used today, for graft allocation. With PRA that identifies several antibodies to a potential cluster of donors, the crossmatch will identify if a recipient had antibodies to a specific donor of interest. It became clear with time that it did not identify all preexisting donor-specific HLA antibodies (HLA-DSA). In recent years, techniques for detection of HLA antibodies have become more sensitive with the introduction of solid-phase assays, including ELISA.

Albert Christian Kruyt

Albert Christian Kruyt (; born 10 October 186919 January 1949) was a Dutch Calvinist missionary, ethnographer and theologian. He was the first to pioneer Christianity in Central Sulawesi, notably in Poso.
Born in Mojowarno, East Java in 1869, he grew up in a missionary family. In 1877, Kruyt was sent to the Netherlands to take missionary education. He returned to the Indies in 1890, and was stationed in Gorontalo. The Netherlands Missionary Society ("Nederlandsch Zendeling Genootschap") sent him to open a new missionary post in Poso, located on the south shore of Tomini Bay. Kruyt started his work in 1892. The first years of his efforts were considered as failures, but the first baptism took place in 1909 and continued to grow in the following years. The mission area he had pioneered until the 1920s, continued to spread through the highlands and mountains to the Gulf of Bone in the south. Kruyt left the Dutch East Indies for good and returned to the Netherlands in 1932. In January 1949, he died in The Hague.
Kruyt is known for his ethno-sociological approach. In his duties as a missionary, he chooses to assimilate and study the civilizations of society first. According to him, without adequate ethnological knowledge, effort in spreading the Gospel is unlikely to succeed. Kruyt argues that a missionary must understand the connection between thought and community life in which he works to win their hearts to embrace Christianity. He prefers locals to embrace Christian voluntarily rather than through coercion.
Kruyt is considered one of the leading theorists, missionaries and ethnographers in the early period of the 20th century. The mission he led in Poso and Central Sulawesi was recognized as one of the greatest successes of the mission of the Gospel in the Indies. His works on ethnography and evangelism—particularly in Central Sulawesi—are regarded as an "extraordinary" source of information. The book he co-authored with Nicolaus Adriani, entitled "" (The Bare'e speaking Toraja of Central Sulawesi), is considered one of the best publications in the field of ethnology, and is the primary source of research by scientists and researchers.
Kruyt was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1898, he resigned in 1932. He became a regular member in 1933.

Byzantine Empire under the Theodosian dynasty

The Eastern Roman Empire was ruled by the Theodosian dynasty from 379, the accession of Theodosius I, to 457, the death of Marcian. The rule of the Theodosian dynasty saw the final East-West division of the Roman Empire, between Arcadius and Honorius in 395. Whilst divisions of the Roman Empire had occurred before, the Empire would never again be fully reunited. The reign of the sons of Theodosius I contributed heavily to the crisis that under the fifth century eventually resulted in the complete collapse of western Roman court.
The Eastern Empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West in the third and fourth centuries, due in part to a more firmly established urban culture and greater financial resources, which allowed it to placate invaders with tribute and pay foreign mercenaries. Throughout the fifth century, various invading armies overran the Western Empire but spared the east.
The Theodosian dynasty also ruled the Western Roman Empire from 392 to 455 AD.
Theodosius I, 379-395.
Theodosius I was granted rule of the Eastern Roman provinces by the Western Augustus, Gratian of the Valentinianic dynasty, due to his having inherited the entire Empire from his predecessor Valens in 378 and to lack of ability to rule over both halves. Gratian would continue to rule the Western Roman Empire until 383. After the deaths of Gratian and his successor Valentinian II, Theodosius became the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire 392-395.
Theodosius is also remembered for making a series of decrees (see Edict of Thessalonica) that essentially codified Nicene Christianity as the official state church of the Roman Empire. Theodosius dissolved the order of the Vestal Virgins in Rome, banned the pagan rituals of the Olympics in Ancient Greece and did nor punish nor prevent the destruction of antique Hellenistic temples, such as the Temple of Apollo in Delphi.
With the death of Theodosius in 395, the Roman Empire was divided once more between his two sons. Arcadius, the older son, inherited the East and the imperial capital of Constantinople, and Honorius inherited the West. The Empire would never be reunited again, though Eastern Roman emperors, beginning with Zeno, would claim the de jure united title after Julius Nepos' death in 480 AD.
Arcadius, 395-408.
Arcadius was a weak ruler, dominated by a series of figures behind the throne as he was more concerned with appearing to be a pious Christian than he was with political and military matters. The first such figure, Rufinus, engendered intense competition with the counterpart of Western Emperor Honorius, "magister militum" of half-Vandal origin Flavius Stilicho, who might have had him assassinated in 395 AD. Later figures in actual power would include consul Eutropius risen from eunuch, general Gainas of Gothic origin, his wife Aelia Eudoxia, the Patriarch John Chrysostom and Praetorian Prefect Anthemius.
Theodosius II, 408-450.
Theodosius II, sometimes nicknamed "the Younger", became Eastern Roman Emperor at the age of seven following the death of his father Arcadius in 408. Praetorian Prefect Anthemius continued to act as a power behind the throne, during whose tenure the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople were completed.
The older sister of Theodosius, Pulcheria, was proclaimed "Augusta" and became regent in 414 AD. Though the regency ended in 416 and Theodosius became "Augustus" himself, Pulcheria remained a strong influence within the government. Influenced by Pulcheria and fuelled by an increasing interest in Christianity, Theodosius went to war against the Sassanid Empire in the early 420s, on the pretext of persecuting Christians. He was forced to allow a stalemate however, as the Huns were marching on Constantinople. The wars with the Huns were usually composed by Hunnic raids being followed by significant payments by the Eastern Empire so that the Huns would remain at peace with the Romans.
The death of Honorius of the West in 423 led Theodosius to supporting and eventually installing Valentinian III as Western Emperor in 425. To strengthen ties between East and West, Licinia Eudoxia, daughter of Theodosius, was betrothed to Valentinian.
Theodosius died in 450 as the result of a riding accident and was succeeded by Marcian, husband of his sister Pulcheria, as Eastern Emperor.
Marcian, 450-457.
Marcian would reverse many of the actions taken by Theodosius II, particularly in terms of treaties with the Huns and in religious affairs. All Eastern Roman tributary payments to Attila ceased under Marcian while Attila was busy invading Italy. Marcian launched preemptive expeditions across the Danube into the Hunnic heartland, winning significant victories against them. The actions of Marcian, combined with famine in Italy, forced Attila to retreat back to the Hungarian plains where he would die in 453. After the death of Attila, Marcian would settle many formerly hunnic vassal tribes within Eastern Roman lands as "foederati", taking advantage of the fall of the Hunnic empire.
He would be succeeded by Leo I, the first Emperor of the Leonid dynasty.

Ecoauthoritarianism

Ecoauthoritarianism, short for ecological authoritarianism, is a political thought arguing for the inevitability and necessity of measures that defy democracy and even commonly accepted human rights in general. The common denominator in ecoauthoritarian thought is the focus on sustainability and the belief that democracy cannot secure survival. Though other regime types are imaginable, the majority of scholars suggest a meritocratic system, although some have suggested a climate dictatorship. Instead of a democratic rule, politicians would be chosen according to their expertise. Democratic will would be replaced by policies guided by science and ecological necessity.
Within green political thought, ecoauthoritarianism is marginal. Ecoauthoritarianism was inspired by "The Limits to Growth" and its conclusion that there are physical limits to growth and that without dramatic changes in all areas of life, Earth is doomed to become uninhabitable. Newer ecoauthoritarian thought underlines the tradeoffs and lack of legitimacy of unsustainable politics in a democracy. It emphasizes that democracy cannot be an absolute, since sustainability is a precondition for everything valuable. It shows how the overexploitation of resources, given its consequences, must be considered as violence and that in fact, many issues cannot be subject to democratic decision making nor should they be subject to democratic decision making. There are many instances where the state already interferes and where interference is essential for public safety.
Ecoauthoritarian thoughts are gaining traction recently, as some people believe democracy is an inadequate system to ensure ecological stability. As problems such as climate change continue to remain unaddressed at a global scale, voices asking for stricter measures are likely to grow louder. Especially, the recent leaps taken by the Chinese government are seen by some scholars as evidence for the superior potential of autocratic governments when it comes to implementing good environmental governance.

Military Engineering Experimental Establishment

The Military Engineering Experimental Establishment (MEXE) was a British defence research unit. It was formed from the Experimental Bridging Establishment in 1946 and was amalgamated with the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment to form the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment in 1970. MEXE developed the MEXE method (a means of assessing the carrying capacity of arch bridges), the MEXE probe (a field tool to estimate the California bearing ratio of a soil) and the MEXE system (a means of estimating properties of a piece of unknown land by comparing it with known similar terrain).
History and organisation.
The Military Engineering Experimental Establishment had its roots in the Experimental Bridging Company of the Royal Engineers (RE), formed from the last un-disbanded battalion of First World War assault engineers, and under the command of a British Army major. This unit developed into the Experimental Bridging Establishment of 1925 under an RE superintendent (from 1933 a chief superintendent). This was reformed into the Military Engineering Experimental Establishment (MEXE) on 22 March 1946 under a chief superintendent (brigadier) after 5 April 1956 the commander was referred to as director and was sometimes a civilian.
MEXE was amalgamated with the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment on 1 April 1970 to form the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment based out of Chertsey, Surrey and Christchurch, Dorset and commanded by Brigadier RA Lindseell MC ADC. This was amalgamated further into the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment in the 1980s and then the Defence Research Agency on 1 April 1991. A further reorganization into the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency followed on 1 April 1995 before a split into the publicly owned Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and the privatised QinetiQ in 2001.
The organisation worked to develop and test new techniques and equipment for use in the British Army. The latter including bridges, rafts, cranes, earthmoving equipment and road pavers. On 6 May 1969 MEXE was awarded the freedom of the borough of Christchurch. Whilst many regiments and corps of the army had been so honoured MEXE was the first experimental establishment to have received such.
Developmental work.
The organisation developed many new products and techniques for the army, many of which were named after itself – for example the MEXE pad vertical landing pad or the MEXEFLOTE pontoon.
MEXE method.
Shortly after the end of the Second World War the establishment developed the MEXE method as a means of quickly assessing the carrying capacity of arch bridges, particularly for military traffic. The method was developed by Alfred Pippard of Imperial College, London. The bridge's span, arch thickness and depth of fill were input into an equation or nomogram to determine a provisional acceptable axle loading. This was then modified by a number of additional factors to determine a maximum permissible loading, which could be used to assess which military vehicles could use the bridge. It was a quick and simple process but provided no assessment of the actual stresses or deflections of the bridge. It was later adapted to civilian use.
MEXE probe.
The MEXE probe, also known as the Soil Assessment Cone Penetrometer or MEXE Cone Penetrometer, is a piece of equipment developed by MEXE to estimate the California bearing ratio (CBR) of a subgrade (soil) in the field. It is a pointed cone attached to a spring-loaded handle by extension spindles. The device is pushed into the ground and a scale reads off the estimated CBR value. It is a quick and simple means of estimating the CBR of the top 0.5 metres of subgrade but is less accurate than the more involved standard CBR test. Expertise is required where granular material is present in the soil. The use of the MEXE Probe can be dangerous where underground services are present.
MEXE system.
MEXE were pioneers in the field of terrain evaluation, where the terrain is assessed and categorised based on a number of characteristics. Areas were divided into "facets" of land broadly homogeneous in morphology, water regime and surface material from a 1:50,000 scale map. Similar facets were grouped into "recurring landscape patterns" whilst anomalous parts of facets were split off as "subfacets". This became known as the MEXE system and allows detailed terrain intelligence to be extrapolated from similar terrain in the region and provided to the commander on the ground. The system was implemented at a wide variety of scales from theatre and army corps (where the facets might be tens of kilometres in size) down to the battalion level. At smaller scales there are increased difficulties in identifying all of the anomalies as sub-facets. The data provided ranges from assessments of how good-going the terrain is for travel to possible sources of building materials. A terrain forecast can be issued, similar to how weather forecasts are issued for aircrew. The method works well in stable ecosystems but struggles in developing countries and tropical climates where land use is continuously evolving.
MEXE shelter/hide.
Surveillance and Target Acquisition units of the British Army used light, prefabricated MEXE modular shelters to set up secure underground hides in what was known as the stay-behind role during the Cold-War. These MEXE shelters consisted of pickets, spacers, and arches and PVC-coated jute fabric with a wire mesh woven in as walls as well as to hold the soil used to create the roof. Periscopes were used during the day and night-vision sights outside the shelter by four man teams in a two men on, two men off ‘hot bunk’ system. Light Mobile Diggers would ideally be used to dig the T-shaped hides quickly.

Oregon Museum Tavern shooting

The Oregon Museum Tavern shooting occurred on May 7, 1981, at Oregon Museum Tavern in Salem, Oregon.
Incident.
Lawrence William Moore, 25, of Scio, Oregon, an unemployed mill worker
walked into the crowded Oregon Museum Tavern on Front Street NE which was hosting a Ladies' night and without saying a word started to fire his 9mm Browning handgun.
Moore first fired at the bar, before turning the weapon at patrons who began to flee.
Once the magazine had run out he reloaded and continued firing.
One of the times he was reloading several patrons at the tavern overpowered him, wrestled him to the ground and held him, waiting for the police to arrive.
The killing spree ended with the killing of 3 people at the scene and the injuring of 20 others; one of these died in hospital later that night, and Dennis Scharf died nearly 32 years later from injuries sustained.
Legal and aftermath.
At trial, beginning on October 6, 1981, he pleaded innocent to the murder charges, citing mental disease or defect as a defense; however, he admitted to being the gunman.
Moore stated the reason for the shooting that he was trying to apprehend members of a 'syndicate' of millionaires, Jews and criminals who had been trying to poison him.
Moore was subsequently found guilty of four counts of aggravated murder and sentenced to four life terms in prison.
Memorial.
The names of the deceased victims are included in a joint memorial wall at Oregon City's Mountain View Cemetery that memorializes some 390 people that were murdered. The memorial was dedicated by The Greater Portland Area chapter of Parents of Murdered Children.

Liber memorialis of Remiremont

The "Liber memorialis" of Remiremont is a confraternity book from the convent of Remiremont in the Vosges. The unique manuscript is preserved in Rome, in the Biblioteca Angelica, where it is shelved as Manoscritto 10. It is not known when it was taken to Rome.
The importance of the manuscript was first recognised in the 1890s by Adalbert Ebner. Since then, it has been used by many historians as a source for early medieval practices of memory, as well as for the history of the monastery of Remiremont itself.
A partial facsimile-edition was published by the Monumenta Germaniae Historica in 1970.
History of the "Liber memorialis".
The manuscript was begun under the direction of Abbess Theuthild, who also wrote a number of surviving letters that have been translated by Michel Parisse.
It is usually assumed that the manuscript was begun in 821, before being largely rewritten in the 860s. This dating is based on a reference in the manuscript to an 'Emperor Louis', who is normally understood to be Louis the Pious. For that reason, Eva Butz and Alfons Zettler have described the "Liber Memorialis" of Remiremont as "a major document of the ecclesiastical and political reforms of the Carolingian Empire under Louis the Pious". However, Michèle Gaillard has suggested that the 'Emperor Louis' could in fact be Louis II of Italy, in which case the manuscript's original creation might be slightly later in date.
The manuscript initially contained liturgy for the mass, a list of rulers, and a list of benefactors. However, from the 860s, new pages started to be added, to include new groups of names. These included kings such as Lothar II, who seems to have visited the monastery in the company of Waldrada and other members of his family in late 861.
In total, the manuscript lists around 11,500 names. These names were written by over 150 different scribes, including many women.

SS Drottningholm (1909)

The Drottningholm is a Swedish steam ship that was built in 1909 at Motala Verkstads Nya AB as the Valkyrian, and was also briefly known as the Nya Strömma Kanal. Given her current name in 1969, she now operates cruises and charters for the Strömma Kanalbolaget and is a listed historic ship of Sweden.
History.
"Valkyrian" was built by the Motala Verkstads Nya AB in Motala and delivered in May 1909 to the Stockholms Ångslups AB of Stockholm for use on a service between Stockholm and Lidingö. She was a sister ship to "Angantyr", built the same year. She was rebuilt in 1914 with an upper deck superstructure.
In 1918, "Valkyrian" was sold to Waxholms Nya Ångfartygs AB, better known as Waxholmsbolaget. In the 1940s a new boiler was fitted, and the upper deck was remodelled with a large seating area in 1949. In 1964, she was sold back to Stockholms Ångslups AB, who sold her to Järnvägs AB Stockholm - Saltsjön the following year. In 1968, she was sold to a private individual, who renamed her "Nya Strömma Kanal" and hired her to Ångfartygs AB Strömma Kanal, better known as Strömma Kanalbolaget. In this guise, she was intended for use on the service between Stockholm and Sandhamn via the Strömma canal, but she proved to have too deep a draught for that route.
In 1969, "Nya Strömma Kanal" was sold to Drottningholms Ångfartygs AB, who renamed her "Drottningholm" and remodelled her, with a dining room on the upper deck. The same year, she started serving the Stockholm to Drottningholm route. In 1980, she was badly damaged in a fire that broke out whilst she was moored at her berth in Stockholm; the fire also spread to the moored alongside. "Drottningholm" was subsequently sold to Mälaröarnas Ångfartygs AB, and, after reconstruction, returned to service with Strömma Kanalbolaget in 1982.
Operation.
The "Drottningholm" is operated by Strömma Kanalbolaget in the Stockholm area, principally on services on Lake Malaren from Stockholm to Drottningholm Palace. She has a length of , a beam of and a draft of . She has a top speed of and carries 150 passengers.

No Excuses (Meghan Trainor song)

"No Excuses" is a song by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor, released on March 1, 2018, as the lead single from her third major-label studio album, "Treat Myself" (2020). Trainor co-wrote it with Jacob Kasher Hindlin and Andrew Wells, who produced it as well. The track was announced in February 2018 along with its official single artwork. The pop song, with country and R&amp;B influences, has lyrics against sexism. The song received acclaim from music critics, some of whom noted that it was a return to the sound of Trainor's album "Title" (2015).
"No Excuses" debuted and peaked at number 46 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100. It peaked within the top 40 of few countries such as Slovakia, Hungary and Scotland. The track is certified Platinum in the US, Canada, and Australia. Colin Tilley directed the music video for "No Excuses", which features visual effects showing Trainor with two carbon copies of herself and donning various outfits that were inspired by the 1980s, in pastel-colored backdrops. She performed the song on several shows, including "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Sport Relief, "Sounds Like Friday Night" and "The Today Show".
Background and release.
Meghan Trainor had been searching for a producer to create her upcoming third major-label studio album "Treat Myself" (2020) with, when she conducted the first session for it with songwriter Jacob Kasher Hindlin. He suggested that they work with then-unknown producer Andrew Wells. Trainor, who was expecting the session to go "really bad or really awesome", ended up writing the song "Let You Be Right" with them, and knew Wells "was the one". The trio subsequently wrote "No Excuses" and recorded it on January 17, 2018, with Wells producing the song. "No Excuses" was one of the last songs written for the album. While describing the song, Trainor said "it needs to be heard right now -- the world could use a song like this. It's about respect -- we need a little more R-E-S-P-E-C-T in the world, especially right now," and called it the "sassiest" song on its parent album.
She revealed the song's title and overall vibe on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" by saying, "don't disrespect me. I'm a woman, have you never met one before?" In the following days, Trainor revealed song lyrics including: "I don't disrespect you, don't you disrespect me", and "Have you lost your mind...open up your eyes." On February 25, 2018, Trainor referenced the song in a letter she published on her site and social media, followed by unveiling of the single's artwork the next day. "No Excuses" was digitally released on March 1, 2018, as the lead single from "Treat Myself". In the United Kingdom, the song was serviced to contemporary hit radio on March 2. It was sent to hot adult contemporary radio in the United States on March 5, and contemporary hit radio the next day. "No Excuses" was also serviced to contemporary hit radio in Italy on March 9, as well as mainstream radio in Australia.
Composition.
"No Excuses" is composed in the key B major with a tempo of 115 beats per minute in common time. The chords in the verses alternate between F and B, while Trainor's vocals span from F3 to C5. Sonically, "No Excuses" is a pop song with country and R&amp;B influences. It was described as a sexism-blasting empowerment anthem. It features Trainor singing over a "funky, retro" beat. Trainor sings the lyrics, "What you sipping on that got you talking crazy? Looking at me sideways, always coming at me," over an incandescent beat. According to Idolator writer Mike Nied, the song is a confident take-down of a disrespectful suitor, that has "fiery" production and playful lyrics and Trainor sounds "right at home" on it.
Critical reception.
The song received acclaim from music critics. Writing for the Daily Express, Shaun Kitchener thought that "No Excuses" was Trainor returning to the "bouncy pop roots" of her first major-label studio album, "Title" (2015). Entertainment Tonight Canada writer Shakiel Mahjouri noted that the song is taking an aim at sexism, and added that the funky and retro song showcases Trainor's "trademark wit and attitude". MTV News' Sam Prance described the song as "amazing" and "incredible" and dubbed it a "stomping girl-power anthem" with a brilliant and catchy chorus. Hugh McIntyre of "Forbes" called the song a solid pop offering that is suitable for all ages, adding that it is "tailor-made to be the type of hit that everyone can get behind" and a perfect utilization of the call and response technique.
Writing for "Bustle", Emily Czachor praised the track, writing that it "touts a marked air of female grit," which seems "particularly relevant right now." It was described as a "newly minted, funk-laden" song. "Jezebel"s Clover Hope likened it to Aretha Franklin's rendition of "Respect" (1967) and called it a "sassy Time's Up-inspired jam", adding "the orchestrated sass is built into Trainor's voice." A Plus writer Jill O'Rourke was positive of the song, calling it "empowering" and adding, "it's all about demanding respect." Mike Nied of Idolator wrote that Trainor "has a serious hit on her hands", describing it as "the sassy pop bop we need in 2018". In a 2020 album review, Nied stated that it "still holds up as a gem", adding that "with its supersized production and unapologetically sassy message", it is "so quintessentially Meghan it simply could not have been forgotten".
Chart performance.
"No Excuses" debuted and peaked at number 46 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and spent a total of 12 weeks on the chart. The song peaked at number 17 on the Adult Contemporary chart and at number 16 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for one million copies certified units. "No Excuses" peaked at number 49 on the Canadian Hot 100, and at number eight on the Canada Hot AC chart, being certified platinum by Music Canada (MC). The song reached number 60 in Australia and number 4 on the New Zealand Heatseekers chart. Despite its low peak, it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) in the former country. "No Excuses" made the top 40 in a few countries: number 21 in Hungary, number 26 in Scotland and number 20 on Slovakia's Radio Hot 100 chart.
Music video.
The song's music video, directed by Colin Tilley, premiered on the same day as the song's release, which Trainor had previously teased on her Instagram account along with a short behind the scenes look at it. The video features visual effects showing the singer with two "carbon copies" of herself. The video features looks inspired by the '80s, including Trainor donning a denim jacket and another one that looks like a cheerleader outfit. Patrick Hosken of MTV News noted that the looks "belong in a mall-pop video from 1987."
An official choreography video for "No Excuses" was released in collaboration with Zumba, on March 5, 2018. It was directed by Tim Milgram. The visual features a "fun, easy" and empowering routine. It made Trainor the first recording artist to star in an official Zumba choreography video. Describing the initiative, the singer stated that always hearing her music in Zumba classes at the gym made her want to create something special for "No Excuses". She intended the choreography to "empower everyone out there to get on their feet", and think about "respect, sassiness and loving [themselves]". The VP of marketing for Zumba said that they have "always been focused on inspiring others to feel empowered and confident", and they hear these themes in Trainor's music which makes her an ideal partner.
On April 3, 2018, Trainor released a dance video to her Vevo page featuring a group of children and young adults performing "energetic" choreography to the song; Trainor herself does not feature in the video. The singer and her creative director, Charm LaDonna, hand-selected the dancers to execute a choreographed dance routine to "No Excuses".
Live performances.
Trainor sung "No Excuses" live on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on March 2, 2018. During this performance, the singer wore white trousers and a denim jacket, and was accompanied by a vocal quartet. According to Idolator's Mike Nied, Trainor delivered "pitch-perfect" vocals in front of the simple stage that featured a lot of glitter. She also performed it on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" on March 5. Trainor wore a glitter-infused top with a "dazzling" jacket and wide-legged pants, joined by a group of four backup dancers and vocalists who wore black, crystallized outfits. A spacey background was projected on a screen and it ended with the group chanting in unison. On March 23, the singer sang the track during the 2018 Sport Relief telethon on BBC One. On April 6, 2018, Trainor performed the song on "Sounds Like Friday Night", and an acoustic version of it during an appearance on "The Today Show", alongside her backup singers and a guitarist playing the song, the same month. "No Excuses" was performed as part of a medley with "All About That Bass", "Let You Be Right" and "Me Too" at the 2018 iHeartRadio MMVAs, held on August 26, 2018.

<doc id="56604590" url="?curid=56604590" title="Galibal">
Galibal

The Kalibal (Gullibul) were an indigenous Australian people of New South Wales.
Name.
The name Kalibal/Galibal could also be used as an exonym. Margaret Sharpe explains its usage:-
The name "Galibal" (Gullybul, Gullyvul, etc.) could be applied to any group who pronounced the final vowel of "gala/gale/gali" 'this' as i, by a (neighbouring) group which did not. Such groups called 'Galibal' could be distinguished among themselves using some other difference, e.g. the use of "nyang" versus "minyang" for 'what', or the shape of the second person singular nominative pronoun ("wiya/wiye/wuhye/wuhje" etc.), or the pronunciation "yugambeh" (versus "jagambe") for 'no'.
Country.
The Kalibal were partially a rainforest people who straddled the borders of the modern states of Queensland and New South Wales and frequented the areas in the latter around Tyalgum, and the Brunswick River divide. For Norman Tindale, their territory ran north from the Macpherson Range extending to the area near Unumgar, and over the border to Christmas Creek in Queensland, while their eastern limits would have stretched to the upper waters of the Nerang River and south to Mount Cougal and the Tweed Range. There are problems with Tindale's mapping, since he generally located the Kalibal where Margaret Sharpe puts the Yugambeh people
Social divisions and rites.
The names of at least 2 clans near Murwillumbah are known,
The male initiation ceremony, called "Bool", changed adolescents from "tabboo" status into "cabra" - fully fledged males. The bora ceremonial site consisted of a circle surrounded by earth banked about 2 feet and measuring 35 yards in diameter. One such site was at the head of the Tweed River and under the McPherson range at a place known as Coowarragum. This was linked by a trench dug out for a distance of some 90 yards to a nearby creek. The final stage of the rite had the initiands travel down the ditch, which was surrounded by shrubs and roofed with branches to form a tunnel until they reached the creek and disappeared for three days.
History of contact.
The Police Magistrate J. Bray recounted in 1901 that the Murwillumbah area had hundreds of blacks when he first went there, and that he had seen some 600 assembled at one time. By the time of his writing, he stated that no more children were to be seen and that the tribe had almost died out.

<doc id="56604640" url="?curid=56604640" title="Laach Castle (Kruft)">
Laach Castle (Kruft)

Laach Castle (), also called the Pfalzgrafen Castle ("Pfalzgrafenburg" or 'Count Palatine's Castle'), is a levelled Salian spur castle by the Laacher See (Lake Laach) opposite the Abbey of Maria Laach. The castle site lies on the territory of Kruft in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. 
Location.
Laach was a motte and bailey castle which stood at a height } on a rock spur which, at that time, was a peninsula because the level of the lake was 15 metres higher. It stood above the eastern shore of the lake and was temporarily the seat of the Rhenish 
counts Palatine. Count Palatine Henry of Laach from the House of Luxembourg-Gleiberg (died 1095) founded the monastery of Laach () in 1093. Laach Castle () was demolished in 1112 by the stepson and adoptive son of Count Palatine Siegfried of Ballenstedt at the instigation of the abbey, who wanted to be absolutely safe from interference by the lord of the castle, the Count Palatine. The demolition of the castle was not a great loss for Siegfried, as he had another castle, Rheineck, nearby.
The 170 -metre-long castle was divided into two sections, the oval bailey facing the lake, the elongated one facing the hinterland. A mighty neck ditch terminated the eastern side 'land' side. Two cross ditches between the two castle baileys offered further protection. Stone towers are evidenced from their foundations (three square towers with 4.5 metre (2) or 8 metre-long sides). The remaining buildings were probably made of wood.
At the beginning of the 16th century only a few remains of the castle were still visible. Today, only few traces and the names of the fields "Laacher Burg" and "Alte Burg" indicate its existence.
Remains of Roman buildings.
During an excavation in 1935, Roman bricks were found by Mayen excavator, Josef Kramer, on the summit of the hill spur. Further remnants of brick were discovered in the 1980s near the lava quarry pit in Hangschutt. These finds suggest that there were originally Roman buildings in the area of the castle. Due to its strategic location and its proximity (approx. 200 metres) to a Roman farmstead in the great Roß valley, Gerd Otto interprets these finds as remains of a defensive structure or refuge fort from late Roman times. Siegfried of Ballenstedt's demolition of the castle also now appeared in a new light. Perhaps the remains of a pagan fort within sight of their monastery caused the monks a certain unease.

Kalle Kurg

Kalle Kurg (born 25 May 1942 in Tartu) is an Estonian poet, writer, critic, translator and editor. As a versatile figure in Estonian culture, he has also published caricatures and worked as a theatre director.
Life.
Kalle Kurg studied Estonian Philology at the University of Tartu (1961–1966) and soon became the Art Director of a nature publication called "Eesti Loodus" (Estonian Nature). Soon after he joined Eesti Televisioon (Estonian Television) as the Senior Director of art programs. In 1971 Kalle went on to work for a leading literary magazine first published in 1923 "Looming" (Creativity), of which he became Editor-in-Chief in May 1976. He remained in this position till January 1988. Kalle Kurg firmly stood by the magazine’s democratic values and during the 70s and 80s Looming became the centre stage of expression for opposite elite; at the same time being enriched by various translations and essays from modern literature and science.
Kalle Kurg worked as the Executive Editor at the Estonian Association of Journalists between 1989–1991, and as the Director of the Department of Publishing at Eesti Televisioon between 1991–1992. In 1992 he founded a cultural magazine "Sina ja Mina" (You and Me), which was the first magazine that got published after Estonian Independence in 1991. 
Kalle was the CEO of several design agencies between 1992–1995, followed by the position of Director and Chief Editor of two publishing houses. He held these positions till 2000.
Kalle Kurg is a member of the Estonian Writers' Union since 1975. In the 1960s and 1970s he was elected as the leader of Tartu and Tallinn Youth Writers Association. In the 1970s and 1980s he was also involved in broadening cultural exchanges between Estonia and foreign countries.

As an essayist, Kalle has published several ecology related pieces in addition to literature, with initiative suggestions to change Estonia to a nature republic etc. Kalle Kurg also took part in shaping the citizens initiated Estonian Democracy Renewal ("EDU" or "E-D-U") between 2005–2011.
Works.
In 1999, Kalle Kurg published a poetry compilation Colours of Darkness ("Pimeduse värvid") which contains the mastery of poetry rooting to autobiography and documentaries. From one side it tells a persons story, from the other gives insights into the realities of Estonia from 1960 to 1990. The loss of freedom paved the way to tragic despair and hope of freedom, irony and dark humour, softened by the wait for freedom, human closeness and the subject of love as well as the problems of existence. 
From 1990 to 1993 and 2000 to 2005 Kalle Kurg wrote and broadcast original short stories at the Estonian Public Broadcasting stations, lastly with no breaks twice a month more than five years. The first seasons short stories covered the subjects of the atmosphere of a closed society, the second season covered the mental, ethical and spiritual problems of a newly independent state. These short stories have been broadcast as repeats series since.
As a literature critic, Kalle Kurg came out with a theory that differed from the official vision of literature in the 1970s. He highlighted the unity of the human motives in Estonian literature, but also showed that methods and forms of problem setting in Estonian literature can be divided between 4 centres. Presenting such a vision in 1973 went against the official theory of literature that emphasised the monolithicity of ideology and form. At the same time he has received several awards with his articles and essays.
In 1981 Kalle Kurg staged the first original modern dance-pantomime performance "Mimeskid" (Mimesques) in the history of the Estonian professional theatre. With its philosophical content and original presentation combined with innovative stage designs, the pantomime (original music by Sven Grünberg, Lepo Sumera) was awarded the highest prize at the International Pantomime Festival in Moscow in 1985. As an author of words staging, Kalle Kurg has stood out with experimental solutions in the way he handled classics.
Kalle Kurg has also translated poetry, novels, philosophical literature and informational literature from Finnish, English, German and Russian.

Firdaussi

Firdaussi (1929 – after 1944) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed very good form as a two-year-old in 1931 when he won three of his five races including the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year his progress was interrupted by illness in spring but he won his last four races, taking the Gordon Stakes before recording his biggest win in the St Leger and then defeating top-class older horses in the Jockey Club Stakes. He ran consistently as a four-year-old in 1933 but won only one minor race. Apart from his victories, Firdaussi was placed in the Eclipse Stakes (twice), Greenham Stakes, Lingfield Derby Trial and Great Jubilee Handicap. After his retirement from racing Firdaussi stood as a breeding stallion in Britain, France and Ireland, but had limited success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Firdaussi was a "big, lusty", strongly made chestnut horse, bred and owned by the Aga Khan. He was sent into training with Richard Dawson at his Whatcombe stables near Wantage in Oxfordshire.
His sire Pharos was a top-class racehorse who won the Champion Stakes but was even more successful at stud, where he sired Pharis, Nearco and Cameronian. Firdaussi's dam Brownhylda won the Epsom Oaks in 1923 and was bought by the Aga Khan at the end of her racing career. Brownhylda's dam Valkyrie, was distantly descended from the influential broodmare Preserve.
Racing career.
1931: two-year-old season.
Firdaussi began his track career in July when he won the Fulbourne Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in July. At Doncaster Racecourse he finished third in a Rous Memorial Plate and then returned to winning form to take the Autumn Foal Plate at Newbury in very impressive style. In the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October he started the 11/10 favourite and won from Short Hand. The colt ended his first season at Hurst Park where he ran second to the gelding Old Riley in the £1,550 Great Two-Year-Old Stakes over six furlongs.
Following a rift between the Aga Khan and Dick Dawson, Firdaussi was moved to Frank Butters' Fitzroy House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the best juveniles in Britain, he was assigned a weight of 126 pounds, making him the fourth-best colt of his generation behind Orwell, Mannamead and the Coventry Stakes winner Cockpen. He earned £3,340 in 1931.
1932: three-year-old season.
On his three-year-old debut contested the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) at Newbury and finished third to Orwell, the leading two-year-old of 1931. The colt then developed a respiratory infection and missed his intended run in the Guineas. He returned in the one and a half mile Lingfield Derby Trial in which he was reportedly some way short of full health but finished second to April the Fifth. In the Epsom Derby on 1 June he was ridden by Steve Donoghue as his usual jockey, Michael Beary, opted to ride the stable's other runner Dastur. After being among the leaders for most of the way Firdaussi took the lead in the straight but was outpaced in the final furlong and came home fifth of the twenty-one runners behind April the Fifth, Dastur, Miracle and Royal Dancer.
At Royal Ascot the colt was matched against older horses in the Hardwicke Stakes and finished fourth behind the four-year-old Limelight. In the ten furlong Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park in July he ran third behind Miracle and the four-year-old Goyescas. At Goodwood Racecourse later that month he started 4/6 favourite for the Gordon Stakes and recorded his first win of the season. He followed up at York Racecourse on 24 August, taking the Duke of York Handicap by one and a half lengths from Colorado Kid, but did not look particularly impressive.
On 7 of September at Doncaster Racecourse Firdaussi, ridden by Freddie Fox, started at odds of 20/1 for the 157th running of the St Leger. He was one of four contenders owned by the Aga Khan, the others being Dastur (again the choice of Michael Beary), Udaipur and Taj Kasra while the other fifteen runners included April the Fifth and Orwell. He had not been an expected runner and his place in the line-up was only confirmed when he beat the Oaks winner Udaipur in a training gallop on 31 August. Firdaussi was not among the early leaders but produced a sustained run along the inside rail in the straight and moved into second place behind Dastur inside the final furlong. He caught his stablemate 50 yards from the finish and won by a neck, with a gap of four lengths back to Silvermire in third. Udaipur and Taj Kasra filled the next two places, giving the Aga Khan four of the first five finishers. After the race the Aga Khan said "I confess my heart was with Dastur. Perhaps you think that is because of betting. It is not so. I do not bet much. I love this game of racing. I am afraid before every big race and rejoice afterwards. Today it is wonderful and I do not forget the man who trained my four- Mr Frank Butters- the man who said 'Let them all run, they all have a chance'".
Firdaussi ended his season on 29 September in the £4,981 Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmarket in which he was ridden by Beary and started the 4/1 third favourite behind the four-year-olds Sandwich and Cameronian. He won a rough and closely contested race by a neck and a length from Gainslaw and Cameronian with Sandwich unplaced. Gainslaw's jockey lodged an objection on the grounds of "squeezing" (causing interference without making contact) but the racecourse stewards allowed the result to stand.
Firdausi's earnings of £17,441 in 1932 made him the most financially successful horse in Britain that year and enabled the Aga Khan and Frank Butters to claim the titles of British Champion Owner and British Champion Trainer respectively.
1933: four-year-old season.
Firdaussi began his third season by running second to Hill Cat in the March Stakes at Newmarket and then finished second, under a weight of 128 pounds, to Colorado Kid (114 pounds) in the Great Jubilee Handicap at Kempton on 6 May. In the Ascot Gold Cup in June he came home fourth behind Foxhunter, Orpen and the mare Nitsichin. In early July at Newmarket, the colt failed to recover from a poor start and finished fourth in the Princess of Wales's Stakes. He produced probably his best performance of the year in the Eclipse Stakes on 14 July when he ran second to Loaningdale.
In September at Newbury Firdaussi finished first in the John Porter Stakes but was disqualified and placed last for causing interference. On his final racecourse appearance Firdaussi recorded his first success of the season as he took the Triennial Produce Stakes at Newmarket. The contest was not particularly competitive: Firdaussi faced only one opponent and started at odds of 1/25.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Firdaussi an "inferior" winner of the St Leger.
In 1934 an LNER steam locomotive was named "Firdaussi" in honour of the racehorse.
Stud record.
Firdaussi was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in England. He was moved to France for the 1935 breeding season and was exported to Rumania in 1939 after being bought by King Carol I. The best of his offspring was probably Panipat, a colt who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1941.

Battle of Kissingen

The Battle of Kissingen was a battle between Bavarian and Prussian troops on 10 July 1866 during the Austrian-Prussian War in and around the town Kissingen (today: Bad Kissingen) in Bavaria. It was part of the campaign of the Main and ended with a victory of the Prussians.
Preliminary campaign.
While the majority of the Prussian armies marched to Bohemia, where they defeated the Austrian and Saxon troops on 3 July at Königgrätz (Sadova), the Prussian western army first moved into the Kingdom of Hanover. After the surrender of Hanover on June 29 these troops were grouped under the name "Mainarmee" (German for: Army of the river Main) and pushed southward towards the river Main against the allies of Austria in southern Germany. The Bavarian troops, who formed the VIIth Federal Corps of the German Confederation, withdrew after several lost battles to Kissingen. There they wanted to prevent the Prussians from crossing the river Franconian Saale.
The battle.
The Prussian troops crossed the Rhön Mountains and occupied Brückenau while the Bavarians took positions along the Saale between Steinach in the northeast and Hammelburg in the southwest. The Prussian Commander Eduard von Falckenstein directed the division of August von Goeben directly to Kissingen. The division of Gustav von Beyer was sent to Hammelburg and the division of Edwin von Manteuffel to Waldaschach (today: Aschach), Hausen and the "Friedrichshall" saltworks (today: "Obere Saline") to capture the neighbouring bridges and catch the Bavarians in the flank. In a fight at Waldaschach the Prussians captured the village and the bridge in the afternoon. At Hausen and Friedrichshall north of Kissingen, where the Bavarians had built a strong line of defense to cover their right flank, heavy fightings developed.
The division of Goeben arrived from northwest on the right side of the Franconian Saale in opposite of the town. The Bavarians had entrenched themselves on the left bank of the Saale and barricaded the bridge "Ludwigsbrücke". At about 9 o'clock the Prussians started attacking the bridge. The attack was repulsed at first. But a pedestrian walkway at the mill "Lindesmühle" about 500 meters south of the town had not been completely destroyed by the Bavarians. The Prussians were able to make this bridge accessible again and bring troops to the other side of the Saale. These attacked the Bavarians on their left flank while on the "Ludwigsbrücke" a second attack took place. Previously, the Bavarian cannons that covered the approaches to the bridge had to be withdrawn under the fire of the Prussian artillery, so that the Prussian infantry finally succeeded in crossing the "Ludwigsbrücke" and entered the town. Heavy street fightings followed. At about one o'clock in the afternoon the town was conquered and the Bavarians had to retreat to the east. After fierce fighting in the cemetery "Kapellenfriedhof" (chapel cemetery) east of the town, the Bavarians had to retreat to the village of Winkels where they built up a new line of defense on the surrounding heights Sinnberg and Winterleite. The Prussians advanced and in the further fightings the Bavarian commander, Lieutenant General Oskar von Zoller, was hit by a shell and mortally wounded. Until about three o'clock in the afternoon all the Bavarian positions on the heights were taken by the Prussians. Now the Prussians advanced to the neighbouring village Nüdlingen. At 4 pm Bavarian reinforcements from Münnerstadt reached Nüdlingen - unnoticed by the Prussians. A surprising Bavarian counterattack was partially successful at first. But in the evening the Prussians started a vigorous counterattack for their part. The Bavarians, who suffered from lack of ammunition, were thrown back onto Nüdlingen.
After Kissingen was lost the Bavarian troops at Friedrichshall and Hausen, which meanwhile also had been taken by the Prussians, got the order to withdraw to Nüdlingen. Under the cover of darkness, the Bavarians marched back to Münnerstadt.
At Hammelburg the Bavarians were defeated too. Prussian artillery fire, which caused heavy devastation in the town, forced the Bavarian troops to leave the town and retreat to Arnstein.
Consequences.
As a result of the battle of Kissingen the Bavarian troops withdrew towards Schweinfurt and Würzburg. A unification with the VIIIth Federal Corps (troops from, Baden, Wuerttemberg and Hesse) was prevented. The Prussians now turned west, where they attacked the VIIIth Corps and occupied Frankfurt.
Aftermath.
According to official figures the Prussians lost 10 officers and 133 men at Kissingen, Waldaschach and Nüdlingen by death, another 10 men at Hammelburg. 25 officers and 673 men were wounded in and around Kissingen, another 6 officers and 66 men at Hammelburg. One officer and 37 men were missed.
The Bavarians lost at Kissingen 1 general, 8 officers and 92 men by death, another 10 men at Hammelburg. 37 officers and 554 men were wounded, another 4 officers and 64 men at Hammelburg. 6 officers and 559 men were missed at Kissingen. Most of them were captured in the town after they were cut off their units. 22 men were missed at Hammelburg. Considerably higher numbers of victims – at least for the Bavarians - are assumed according to recent research which count 246 dead Bavarians for Kissingen and 23 for Hammelburg.
Memory.
Most victims of the battle - no matter whether Bavarians or Prussians - were buried together in mass graves at the cemetery "Kapellenfriedhof" and next to it. Some were buried at once in graves in the fields where they had been found. Three Jewish Prussians are buried at the Jewish cemetery of Kissingen, among them an officer. All this graves still exist until today. A memorial for the victims of both sides was erected at a mass grave beside the Kapellenfriedhof showing the „Mourning Germania“ of the sculptor Michael Arnold. A mass grave near Hausen and "Friedrichshall" is the place of another memorial. At the place where Oskar von Zoller had been mortally wounded a monument commemorates the Bavarian commander. Another memorial at the street from Winkels to Nüdlingen was erected for the more than 60 fallen of the Prussian infantry regiment No. 19 of Posen (Poznan) in the Polish part of Prussia. Before the fight the Prussian General Ferdinand von Kummer had held a speech in Polish to the soldiers, because most of them were Polish inhabitants of the Province of Posen. Representatives of the Polish state took part in a memorial celebration in Kissingen at the 150th anniversary of the battle.

Sophia Braeunlich

Sophia Braeunlich (July 2, 1854 – August 11, 1898) was an American business manager and journalist. She started her career as an amanuensis at "The Engineering and Mining Journal", advancing to positions of exchange news editor and reader. She was elected secretary and treasurer of the Scientific Publishing Company, and served as the establishment's business manager. The "Engineering and Mining Journal" and the "Mineral Industry" felt the influence of Braeunlich in devising and adopting the best methods for increasing circulation, obtaining advertisers, improving the quality of the published matter, and systematizing the efficiency of office work.
Braeunlich worked out of an office which had been previously used by Henry Ward Beecher. She was the first American woman elected a fellow of the Imperial Institute of Great Britain, and was a delegate to the international geological congress at St. Petersburg, Russia in 1897.
Early years and education.
Sophia Toepken was born on Long Island in Bethpage, New York, now known as Old Bethpage, July 2, 1854. She was the daughter of Frederick and Mary Toepken. Losing her parents when very young, from the age of four, she was cared for by her aunt, her mother's sister, Mrs. Henry Grahlfs, of Brooklyn, with whom she resided during the remainder of her life.
Her education was carefully conducted in the United States and in Germany, where she spent several years, from the age of twelve, till sixteen, when she returned to her aunt's home.
Career.
Shortly after her return to Brooklyn, she married Conrad Robert Braeunlich, but her husband died after a brief time. Left dependent upon her own resources, she then entered the Packard Business College in New York City, taking a full course of study, and graduating from in 1879. Braeunlich was the first of the women graduates of that institution to enter professional life, Mr. Packard having secured a position for her as amanuensis in the office of "The Engineering and Mining Journal", on December 11, 1879. She worked for Richard Pennefather Rothwell, the editor of that journal and president of the Scientific Publishing Company. In 1885, she advanced to the position of exchange news editor and reader.
The publishing and book selling trade of the company was large and influential, covering all topics related to the mineral industries of all countries. Braeunlich mastered the technical details pertaining to the paper, attended the meetings of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and frequently went down into mines on such occasions, thus gaining practical knowledge of various details that increased her usefulness in the office. In 1888, when the secretary and treasurer of the publishing company resigned his position, Braeunlich was elected to fill the vacancy. She displayed such remarkable executive ability, combined with energy and ambition, that in 1890, she was promoted to the office of business manager of the entire establishment. She had full charge of the general business and financial departments, and she assisted in the government work connected with the collection of gold and silver statistics for the Eleventh Census. She increased the efficiency of the force, the business of the company, and the influence of "The Engineering and Mining Journal", "The Mineral Industry", and other publications of the company, and their value to the thousands who read them. Her interest covered every department of the business, whether editorial, news gathering, circulation, or advertising of "The Engineering and Mining Journal" and "The Mineral Industry", or the growing publishing and bookselling trade of the Company.
Braeunlich was a member of the Professional Woman's League and the Woman's Press Club, in both of which she was an honored and influential member, although she refused to take part in their public proceedings. She was the first American woman elected a fellow of the Imperial Institute of Great Britain. In July 1892, it was reported that Braeunlich had been ill and hospitalized for almost 21 weeks, but in 1897, she was a delegate to the international geological congress at St. Petersburg, Russia. Her office was the same one which Henry Ward Beecher used at the time of his editorial work on "The Christian Union".
Death and legacy.
Braeunlich died in New York City, on August 11, 1898.
The Sophia Fund, incorporated in May, 1900, was organized by Rothwell as a memorial to Braeunlich. The object of the fund was to "remove friendless little girls from dangerous and demoralizing surroundings and place them in desirable private families, and where possible to have them adopted". The fund started with a donation of about , a part of which was contributed from moneys left by Braeunlich.

Fly (Marshmello song)

"Fly" is a song recorded by American electronic music producer and DJ Marshmello, featuring American singer and songwriter Leah Culver. It was released on March 9, 2018.
Background.
On March 7, 2018, Marshmello confirmed that "Fly" would be released two days later, on March 9.
Music videos.
Two music videos were produced for the song. The first one is completely done in computer animation and features Marshmello hanging onto numerous colorful balloons while floating over New York City. As the sun begins to set, Marshmello lets go of the balloons and proceeds to fly through the sky. These events are revealed to be imagined as Marshmello sits on a bench, presumably in Central Park, while holding only a single balloon.
The second video was made in conjunction with Disney Channel to promote the 2017 reboot series "DuckTales". This video mixes live-action with the series' traditionally animated style and features the characters of Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck, and Webby Vanderquack traveling through space via a rocket ship. The ship crashes on a planet resembling Marshmello's head with a soft and bouncy terrain. Marshmello himself appears, apparently as the sole occupant of the planet, and aids the Ducks in rebuilding their ship using electronic musical instruments, which they are seen using to perform the track. The Ducks leave the planet with Marshmello in tow.

Trinity Methodist Church, Cardiff

Trinity Methodist Church, now the Trinity Centre, is a Grade II listed former Methodist church in Adamsdown, Cardiff, Wales.
Church.
The church was built in 1896–1897 by Albert Victor Ingall &amp; Sons of Birmingham. Originally named Newport Road Wesleyan Methodist Church, it was the last built of a number of Methodist presences in the area, the others being Roath Road (opened in 1871, which stood at the junction of Newport Road and City Road, the former being originally named Roath Road until ) and Broadway (originally founded in 1872 in what is now Nora Street, later moving to Broadway in 1879-80). By the postwar years, this situation had become untenable: the Roath Road church was rendered unusable during the Cardiff Blitz of 1941, and both had seen a decline in attendance. In 1950, the decision was made to merge the Roath Road and Broadway congregations into that of Newport Road, which was renamed Trinity Methodist Church upon the merger. The Roath Road church (already a ruin) was demolished in 1955. The Broadway site was sold to the BBC for £7000 and was used as a studio until . It subsequently became a commercial premises before being converted into a mosque in 1980. It was destroyed on 19 September 1989 by a fire which caused substantial damage to several other buildings on Broadway.
An extensive remodelling occurred at Trinity in 1978, during which the building was subdivided horizontally by Wyn Thomas &amp; Partners.
Recent Use.
By the early 2010s, the building had become hard to maintain, and worship ceased in the building in 2013. It is now used by the Welsh Refugee Council as a welcoming and assistance centre. The centre formerly received an Equality and Diversity Grant from the Welsh Government. This was ended in 2017, though the grant only supported part of the work performed by the Centre. The location is also used for worship by the Mar Thoma Syrian Church. The congregation began as a prayer group of St Thomas Mar Thoma Church in Bristol, with the first meeting held in Cardiff in 2006. The congregation became independent in 2015.
Oasis Centre.
A similar facility is located in the Oasis Centre on Splott Road. The Centre (also a former Methodist church) was originally founded in 1886, with a large chapel being added in 1895, and a schoolroom in 1908. The chapel was demolished in 1964, with the schoolroom being adapted as a replacement. It was converted into the Oasis Centre in 2008.

Sunhae Im

Sunhae Im (; Hanja: 任善惠; born in 1976) is a South Korean soprano. She has been described as a bright and versatile lyric soprano with lightness and coloratura. She first gained her reputation in the field of early music and now performs a wide range of classical and non-classical music.
Career.
Sunhae Im was born in Cheorwon, South Korea. She studied vocal music with Lokyung Pak at Seoul National University in South Korea and with Roland Hermann at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe in Germany. In 1997 she was awarded the Grand Prix in the Korea Schubert Society–Munhwa Ilbo Competition (Seoul), the Grand Prix in the Korean Voice Competition (Seoul), the Second Prize in the Dong-A Music Competition (Seoul), and the Second Prize and the Audience Prize in the International Schubert Competition (Osaka, Tokyo). In 2000, she was a finalist in the Queen Elisabeth Competition (Brussels).
She made her European debut with the conductor Philippe Herreweghe in Antwerp, Belgium in December 1999, by singing Mozart's "Et Incarnatus Est" from Great Mass in C Minor as well as his solo motet "Exsultate Jubilate". Her operatic debut was made in early 2000 as Barbarina in "The Marriage of Figaro" by Mozart at the Frankfurt Opera, where she also performed as Amore and Valetto in "The Coronation of Poppea" by Monteverdi. She was a member of Staatsoper Hannover and performed as Zerlina (in "Don Giovanni"), Papagena ("The Magic Flute"), Blonde (""The Abduction from the Seraglio"), Adele ("Die Fledermaus"), and Yniold ("Pelleas et Mélisande") between 2001 and 2004, before freelancing.
Sunhae Im is known especially for historically-informed performance of operas and oratorios from the Baroque and Classical eras. She is asked most frequently to perform works by Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart. Her compilation album "Portrait" (2017) consists of pieces by those four composers. Many examples of her work in early music are found from the collaboration with René Jacobs, a master conductor of early music. She joined Jacobs in recording both passions by Bach, five operas by Mozart, two operas by Handel, and one opera by Haydn, as well as performing in numerous live concerts and operas. Jacobs wrote in his autobiography, "some of them, such as Stéphane Degout and Sunhae Im, were among the best actor-singers I know." She also interpreted lesser known works by composers including Terradellas, Soler, Gassmann, and Conti.
In addition to Baroque and Classical music, her repertoire includes Renaissance (such as works by Byrd), Bel canto (Rossini and Donizetti), Romantic (Mendelssohn, Schumann, Fauré, and Mahler), and modern classical music (Poulenc and Schulhoff). For example with the conductor Manfred Honeck, she performed Mahler's Symphony No. 2 and No. 4, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites" (as Sister Constance), Bach's "St John Passion", Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" (as Susanna), "Idomeneo" (as Illia), and Requiem (at Carnegie Hall, Musikverein, and Berliner Philharmonie). She also performs nonclassical music occasionally. She appeared as Christine Daaé of Maury Yeston's musical "Phantom" in its 2015 South Korean premiere and 2019 &amp; 2021 revival.
She has worked with conductors including René Jacobs, Manfred Honeck, Fabio Biondi, William Christie, Philippe Herreweghe, Sigiswald Kuijken, Andreas Spering, Iván Fischer, Zubin Mehta, Myung-whun Chung, Ton Koopman, Giovanni Antonini, Herbert Blomstedt, Kent Nagano, and Riccardo Chailly. She has worked with groups including the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic.
In 2009, Sunhae Im was the soprano soloist for the Pentecost solemn mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, where she performed Haydn's "Harmoniemesse" with Helmut Müller-Brühl. In 2014, she sang the national anthem of South Korea for the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games. She performed in various national and social events such as the concert for 2017 South Korea-China Summit in Beijing, 2019 Human Rights Day Ceremony in Seoul, and 2020 Korea Memorial Day Ceremony in Daejeon. She recorded a sound track "Will Be Back" for the Seoul Broadcasting System drama "" in 2016. She performed in five episodes of the TV program "The Master" broadcast by Mnet TV in South Korea in 2017. She has sometimes assumed the role of broadcasting host (rather than singer) for TV and radio programs. She often volunteers to sing at benefit concerts, including the Hopeshare Concert series that she has been organizing since 2009.

D'Assas-class cruiser

The "D'Assas" class comprised three protected cruisers of the French Navy built in the early 1890s; the ships were , , and . They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the "D'Assas"-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of six guns supported by four guns and they had a top speed of .
All three ships began service in the Mediterranean Squadron in the late 1890s, though "D'Assas" was later transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1901 and then to French Indochina in 1904. "Du Chayla" supported an amphibious landing in French Morocco in 1907 and "Cassard" joined her there the following year. "D'Assas" was discarded in 1914, but the other two members of the class saw service during World War I, primarily patrolling the Atlantic for German commerce raiders. Both ships were partially disarmed late in the conflict and "Cassard" became a gunnery training ship while "Du Chayla" remained in active service. She took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 before being sold to ship breakers in 1920, while "Cassard" lingered on in service until 1924, when she, too, was sold for scrap.
Design.
In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships—the and es—into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a "two-power standard" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies.
The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships.
To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The "D'Assas" class were ordered to as part of the program, and were very similar to the earlier s.
General characteristics and machinery.
The "D'Assas"-class cruisers were long between perpendiculars and long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . displaced , while the other two vessels displaced . "D'Assas" suffered from stability problems and reportedly sat lower in the water than her sister ships.
The ships' hulls featured a pronounced ram bow and a tumblehome shape, which were common characteristics of major French warships of the period. They had a flush deck with a sloped stern. Their superstructure consisted of a main conning tower with a bridge forward and a smaller, secondary conning tower aft. The ships were fitted with a pair of pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. Their crew varied over the course of their careers and ranged from 370 to 392 officers and enlisted men.
The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twenty coal-burning Lagrafel d'Allest water-tube boilers that were ducted into three funnels on the centerline amidships. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which permitted a cruising radius of at and at 20 knots.
Armament and armor.
The ships were armed with a main battery of six Modèle 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual pivot mounts; one was on the forecastle, two were in sponsons abreast the forward conning tower, another pair was in sponsons further aft, and the last was on the stern. The guns fired a variety of shells, including solid cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing shells. The muzzle velocity ranged from . These were supported by a secondary battery of four Modèle 1891 guns, which were carried in pivot mounts in the conning towers, one on each side per tower. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . 
For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried ten 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and five 1-pounder guns. The ships were also armed with two torpedo tubes in their hull above the waterline. The torpedoes were the M1892 variant, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .
Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, increasing to on the sides that sloped down to the side of the hull. Above the deck at the sides, a cofferdam filled with cellulose was intended to contain flooding from damage below the waterline.

"D'Assas" and "Cassard" initially served with the Mediterranean Squadron after entering service in 1898, and they were joined by "Du Chayla" the following year. In 1901, "D'Assas" had been transferred to the Northern Squadron, based in the English Channel. During this period, they were occupied with routine peacetime training exercises with the rest of the main French fleets in home waters. "D'Assas" was deployed to the cruiser squadron based in French Indochina in East Asia, and in 1905, she assisted with the unsuccessful attempt to re-float the armored cruiser after it ran aground. By that time, "Cassard" had been reduced to reserve.
In August 1907, "Du Chayla" supported an amphibious assault in French Morocco during the Bombardment of Casablanca. "Cassard" was reactivated in 1908 for a deployment to French Morocco. "D'Assas" returned home that year and was converted into a fast minelayer, along with "Cassard". "D'Assas" was struck from the naval register in 1914; she was then sold to ship breakers.
At the start of World War I in August 1914, "Cassard" initially operated out of Morocco, patrolling for German U-boats. "Du Chayla" was also assigned to patrol duty in the Atlantic, but she, too, saw no action. In September, "Cassard" bombarded local villages in Morocco to suppress challenges to French colonial rule. The ship was later transferred to the western Mediterranean and Red Seas, along with a deployment to the Indian Ocean in 1917. By 1918, "Du Chayla" had been partially disarmed to supply weapons to the French Army. She took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 but was recalled to France in 1920, where she was struck from the naval register in 1921 and sold to ship breakers. In the meantime, "Cassard" was partially disarmed after World War I and was converted into a gunnery training ship, though she was struck from the register in 1924 and sold for scrap.

Avishek Karthik

Avishek Karthik is an Indian film actor who has appeared in Tamil language films. Closely associated with director Gautham Menon, Karthik has worked previously as Menon's assistant in the films "Pachaikili Muthucharam" (2007) and "Vaaranam Aayiram" (2008), before making a breakthrough as an actor through the director's experimental thriller "Nadunisi Naaygal" (2011).
Early Life.
Karthik was born into a Telugu speaking family to Mahesh Reddy and Suryakala. He is the brother of actress Maheswari and the nephew of actress Sridevi.
Career.
Karthik joined Gautham Menon's directorial team in 2006 and worked with him during the production of "Pachaikili Muthucharam" (2007), before being announced as one of the four new male leads in a film titled "Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikaalam" to be directed by Menon. The film, set in the backdrop of Chennai's IT industry, began its shoot in mid-2007 with Trisha leading an ensemble cast but was later delayed and then eventually shelved.
Karthik then continued his work with Menon as an assistant director, and featured in the supporting role of Mahesh, Suriya's friend in "Vaaranam Aayiram" (2008). He subsequently opted against continuing in Menon's team for "Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa" (2010), but was approached to act in the director's experimental film "Nadunisi Naaygal" (2011) alongside Veera and Sameera Reddy. Credited in the film as Deva, he worked out and built his body to portray a cop convincingly. The film opened to mixed reviews, with a critic from Rediff.com noting "Deva, as the serious Assistant Commissioner of Police, does a neat job", while Behindwoods.com wrote "Deva who plays a cop has nothing much to do but he does it well". The film was later also dubbed and released in Telugu, with Karthik's link to actress Sridevi garnering the film further attention from the media.
In mid-2014, he began work on "Kaathadi", which eventually had a delayed release in February 2018.

Why Are People Grudgeful?

"Why Are People Grudgeful?" is a 1993 single by British post-punk band the Fall. It reached number 43 on the UK singles chart. The song is based on two Jamaican recordings from 1968, "People Funny Boy" by Lee Perry, and its answer record, "People Grudgeful" by Joe Gibbs, which are regarded as being among the first reggae records.
Background.
In the mid-1960s Lee Perry worked with Joe Gibbs at Wirl Records in Kingston, but after a disagreement left to form his own label, Upsetter. His first release, "People Funny Boy", credited to Lee (King) Perry, was seen as a direct attack on Gibbs, and became highly popular, heralding the new reggae sound with its "loping, lazy, bass-driven beat". Gibbs retaliated with "People Grudgeful", credited to Sir Gibbs.
Recording.
Mark E. Smith combined parts of both Perry's and Gibbs' lyrics in the Fall's version. The band at the time of the recording comprised Smith (vocals), Craig Scanlon (guitar), Steve Hanley (bass), Dave Bush (keyboards), Simon Wolstencroft (drums, keyboards). The record was produced by ex-Fall member Simon Rogers.
Release.
The record was released in April 1993, and reached no.43 on the UK singles chart, the fourth-highest chart placing of any Fall single. A different version of the song was included as a bonus track on CD edition of the album "The Infotainment Scan".

Palácio dos Condes da Guarda, Cascais

The Palácio dos Condes da Guarda (Palace of the Counts of Guarda) is located in Cascais, Lisbon District, Portugal. The building now functions both as the headquarters of the Municipality of Cascais and, on the ground floor, as a museum that explains the history of the town.
History of the building.
The two-storey building dates back to the 18th century. It has since been enlarged by work carried out in the 20th century, particularly in 1918 when three separate buildings were joined together. The most distinctive feature of the building is the external use of decorative tiles of saints, specifically Saint Sebastian, Saint Anthony, Saint Martial, Saint Matthew, Mark the Evangelist, Saint Jerome, Luke the Evangelist and Saint John. These are considered to be the largest collection of such tiles ever applied to the facades of a single property. The oldest are believed to have been produced at the Real Fábrica de Louça do Rato in 1790. This was a ceramic factory in Lisbon that was founded by the Marquis of Pombal and, between 1767 and 1835, pioneered the manufacture of modern pottery, particularly tableware, in Portugal. 
The interior of the building, although much altered, also has some elements from the original structure, namely the entrance patio with vaulted roof and the access staircase and landing to the first floor, which is decorated with tiles from the end of the 18th century. On the first floor there are decorations in neo-baroque style. Archaeological work carried out in 1992 in the area of the main entrance revealed traces of occupation by fishing communities between the 13th and 17th centuries with the land believed to have been used for manufacture and repair of nets.
The first written information about the existence of the palace dates back to the end of the 18th century during the Napoleonic wars when the house was chosen by the governor of Cascais to house the British Navy Admiral Sir Charles Cotton. In 1810, the property was sold to João Lopes Calheiros de Menezes, who settled there. In 1860, when one of his heirs received the title of the first Count of Guarda the house became known as the "Palácio dos Condes da Guarda". In 1918 the building was acquired by the lawyer Herlander Ribeiro who had plans to use it as a hotel and casino. However, these plans failed to eventuate and in 1932 the building was sold to the Municipality of Cascais.
The museum.
The small museum is divided into five thematic areas, illustrating the main moments of the history of the region. It includes items from prehistory up to a set of photographs from 1900 that show the first steps in the transformation of a fishing village into an important town. The Museum also uses some innovative multimedia techniques.

The Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg (Ludwigsburg State Archives), located in Ludwigsburg, Germany, is a public institutional repository for roughly 680 state authorities within the District of Stuttgart, Germany.
Holdings.
The historical holdings come from the North Württemberg area. Notable holdings, unveiled through the process of denazification, include documents related to the holocaust (more than 500,000).
The archives also house the files of the Police Headquarters Stuttgart , the decorative folders and role books of the Staatstheater Stuttgart and all birth records of the Landesfrauenklinik Stuttgart (Stuttgart Women's State Hospital); the documents of the Teutonic Order, official books of the convent Ellwangen and documents of Ulm, Esslingen am Neckar, Heilbronn, and other former free imperial cities. The collections also include personnel files of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (the German National Railway) and the Deutsche Bundesbahn (the German Federal Railway) from the Reichsbahndirektion/Bundesbahndirektion Stuttgart (Federal Railway Directorate).
Facilities.
The Ludwigsburg State Archives relocated, in 1995, from a castle to the Arsenal Barracks and Armory located in the center of Ludwigsburg.
Both buildings were mechanically and structurally re-purposed to meet the safekeeping requirements of modern archives. The buildings are connected by an underground corridor, through which a transport system delivers documents to researchers in the reading room.
Governmental oversight.
As part of the Baden-Württemberg administrative reorganization of 2005, Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg has been a department of the newly created Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg (Baden-Württemberg State Archives), which was inaugurated January 1, 2005. Staatsarchiv Ludwigsburg is one of eight constituent departments of Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg . Six of the eight departments have an archival mission and two have a service mission.

A.M.E. Church Review

The A.M.E. Church Review is the journal of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Established in 1841 and revived in 1884, it is arguably the earliest published African-American journal. It publishes articles on religion, politics, history, and world events.
History.
Originally named "The A.M.E. Church Magazine", it was first published in September 1841 by the church's general book steward, Rev. George Hogarth of Brooklyn, New York. It was intended to be a monthly publication, but appeared only sporadically and was discontinued after eight years due to lack of funds. 
At the 1884 General Conference, the name of the organization's publication was changed to "A.M.E. Church Review" and Rev. Benjamin Tucker Tanner was elected editor. He was succeeded by Levi Jenkins Coppin in 1888; Hightower Theodore Kealing in 1896; and Reverdy C. Ransom in 1912.
Early contributors to the journal included abolitionist Frederick Douglass, journalist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, editor T. Thomas Fortune, Judge David Augustus Straker, educator William Sanders Scarborough, Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce, author Theophilus Gould Steward, attorney T. McCants Stewart, and bishops Daniel Alexander Payne, Henry McNeal Turner, and Jabez Pitt Campbell.

Mad Love (Sean Paul and David Guetta song)

"Mad Love" is a song recorded by Jamaican rapper Sean Paul and French music producer David Guetta, featuring guest vocals from American singer Becky G. It was written by Shakira, Paul, Guetta, Majasty Jones, Emily Warren, Rosina Russell, Ina Wroldsen, Raoul Lionel Chen, Jack Patterson and Giorgio Tuinfort, with production handled by Guetta, Patterson, Tuinfort, Jason Jigzagula Henriques, Banx &amp; Ranx and 1st Klase. The song was released via Island Records on 16 February 2018, as the fourth single from Paul's EP "Mad Love the Prequel".
Background.
The song was first revealed in June 2017 Islands label singer/songwriter Majasty Jones. It initially featured Colombian singer Shakira instead of Becky G. Speaking about the song, Sean Paul explained: "I got something kind of more poppy coming in a little while, with Shakira. The song's called 'Mad Love', it's about being mad and having love, it's more sexy. It's not about love, it's the sexiness." Paul later revealed in an interview with "Billboard" in August 2017 that the song was intended to be titled "Temple".
Paul said of the song in a press release: "I've been working on this record for a long time. It was a pleasure to work with David Guetta and his team as we got the production to the perfect sound. It was also great to work with Becky G and her team. Nuff love to all of them! The song is full of energy and I can't wait for people to hear it!" Guetta added that they spent two years working on the song, and he is grateful that the song is finally getting released. He is proud of the track, praising Paul for his "unique style" and Becky G for her vocals, which "just make everything come together". Becky G declared that she appreciates the opportunity to work with "an icon like Sean". She regarded "Mad Love" as a song that "brings people together" and "give you the energy you need to get up and get on the dance floor".
Critical reception.
Xavier Hamilton of "Vibe" wrote that the song manages to "embody every aspect of a modern pop record" and "add to all of the artists' cross-cultural popularity". "Rap-Up" called it an "island-flavored collaboration" and a "dance floor-ready track". Chantilly Post of HotNewHipHop deemed it "a pop, radio-friendly track", writing "David provides a bouncy EDM beat that hears Becky and Sean sing about vibing and hitting it off to the 'tempo' of a song."

Antonio Montauti

Antonio Montauti (1685 - 1740) was an 18th-century Italian sculptor active in Florence and Rome.
Biography.
He was a pupil of Giuseppe Piamontini. His patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria de' Medici, obtained the first known works circa 1708-9. They were destined for his first patron. In 1733 he was recruited to Rome by Cardinal Alamanno Salviati and soon won the favor with Pope Clement XII, who in 1735 appointed him as surveyor for the Vatican. He completed both statuary, busts, as well as smaller bronzes and medals.
About 1715 he carved two reliefs of St Philip Neri, depicting the "Ecstasy of Philip" and the "Distribution of Bread" for the church of San Firenze in Florence. In 1721 a now lost Ganymede and four other marbles he was carving for John Molesworth were described as his "first works". In 1726 he made large marble statue of "Saint Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi" for the cloister of San Frediano in Cestello.

<doc id="56605826" url="?curid=56605826" title="Fuggerau">
Fuggerau

The Fuggerau was a mining and ore-smelting facility near Arnoldstein in north-east Germany. It was probably set up by the Fugger family, though the name 'Fugger' was already in evidence in the area before 1495 without any links to that family.
History.
It was set up by the brothers Ulrich, Georg and Jakob in 1495 on lands that they had acquired from Arnoldstein Abbey. This was done with the express permission of the Bishopric of Bamberg, in which the Abbey fell and with whom the Fuggers already had business dealings thanks to their presence in Franconia. The family was granted water rights, landowner rights, fortification rights, all the pledge-service that the abbey owed to the Bishopric, the right to cut down trees at will and to hunt and fish within certain limits, in return for the Abbey being compensated for its pledge-service. These rights were extended in 1496. The Fuggers were also allowed to exercise lower-court rights at the Schloss Rosenheim, though high-court rights remained with the 'vicedom' of Carinthia.
The complex was a combination of separating-works, hammer mill and cannon foundry, turning out 261 cannon in 1504 as well as the heavy guns used to arm the complex's own fortress. Metal smelting occurred within the walls of the fortress and brass hammering in the valley, since it needed water power, probably from the River Gailitz. The Fuggerau was in the right place to work not only locally-mined ore but also ores from Upper Hungary for the Venetian market. According to Pölnitz the gold worked there came from the "Klieming" (a misspelling of Kliening). Copper worked there was mainly meant for Venice - between 1495 and 1504, 50,000 Venetian hundredweight of copper and 22,000 Viennese silver-marks were spent in Venice. Between 1527 and 1546 thirty-three lead pipes were made at the Fuggerau as well as at Bleiberg, where the Fuggers were also involved. The lead supply from Schwaz also went to the Fuggerau for processing.
The first 'factor' employed by the Fuggers was Hans Fugger vom Reh, a cousin of Jacob the Rich. Hans died at the Fuggerau in 1503 and was followed by Georg Fugger's son in law Christoph Hering and then by Jobst Zeller, who was dismissed after being blamed for the Venetian seizure of guns from the Fuggerau during the War of the League of Cambrai. In 1537 Gastel Fugger vom Reh became factor.
Brass was only hammered at the complex under 1530 and from 1547 onwards the family began to retreat from the Hungarian mining industry and to concentrate on domestically-mined ores, which left the Fuggerau with less and less importance. The brothers Marx and Hans Fugger sold the Fuggerau, all its properties and rights and even its equipment and furniture back to the Abbey in 1570 for 2500 guilders during the abbacy of Petrus von Arnoldstein. The buildings fell into ruin and the local population forgot the name 'Fuggerau' - in 1688 the ruins are shown in a view by Valvasor. The Schrotturm Gailitz was built on the ruins in 1814, before being replaced by another tower of the same name in 1830, which operated until 1974 and still survives today.

Tinea belonota

Tinea belonota is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as not threatened by the Department of Conservation.
Taxonomy.
It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1888 using a specimen collected in Palmerston North in March. This holotype specimen has not been found at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1926 Charles E. Clarke, thinking he was describing a new species, gave this moth the name "Gymnobathra zephyrana". Alfred Philpott synonymised this name in 1931. The specimen Clarke used for this description was collected in Whangarei and is now held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species is also known as "Tinea" (s.l.) "belonota".
Description.
Meyrick described this species as follows:
This species is visually similar to "Trithamnora certella" and "Tinea mochlota" but can be distinguished as "T. belonota" has broader wings, lacks discal spots, has a more obvious pale streak, and different cilia.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to New Zealand. It has been collected in Palmerston North, Whangarei and at Okauia in the Waikato.
Conservation status.
This species has been classified as being "not threatened" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Reaume Brothers Racing

Reaume Brothers Racing is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. The team is owned by Josh Reaume, and it currently fields the Nos. 33 and 34 Chevrolet Silverados for various drivers.
Driver Development Program.
In July of 2021, Reaume Brothers Racing announced their new late model driver development program. In a press release, it was announced former kart racer Stephen Mallozzi and RBR employee Johnathan Cuevas would be the program’s two inaugural drivers. Reaume expressed a desire to help young drivers the way he had been helped throughout his career, and felt creating a development program was the best way to go about doing so.
Xfinity Series.
In 2020, RBR took over operations of the RSS Racing No. 93 entry in late June and retained those duties for the rest of the season. The partnership continued in 2021 with the RSS No. 23 before Our Motorsports purchased the car's owner points in March.
After Our acquired the No. 23, RBR formed a partnership to field MBM Motorsports' No. 13.
Camping World Truck Series.
Truck No. 00 history.
In 2020, Reaume debuted the No. 00. Angela Ruch was announced to be the full-time driver. However, after eight races, Ruch was released to lack of sponsorship. For the rest of the season, Josh Reaume, Dawson Cram, Ryan Huff, Bobby Kennedy, J. J. Yeley, Kyle Donahue, Josh Bilicki and Jason White filled the schedule. The team's best finish was a 17th at Michigan International Speedway with team owner Reaume behind the wheel.
Truck No. 32 history.
Daniel Sasnett drove the No. 32 Toyota Tundra at World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway in 2019, where he started 30th and finished 26th. The team entered for select events throughout the season. On July 26, 2019, Reaume Brothers Racing announced that Devin Dodson would make his NGOTS debut in the No. 34 Chevrolet at Eldora. The number was later changed to 32. For the rest of the season in the 32, Mason Massey, Daniel Sasnett, Bryant Barnhill, Devin Dodson and Gregory Rayl made one start apiece. 
Truck No. 33 history.
On February 15, 2018, it was announced that a brand new team would open and field the No. 33 Chevrolet Silverado full-time for Josh Reaume. The team failed to qualify for the season opener at Daytona. They then qualified for the next 7 races with a best finish of 23rd at Texas before another DNQ at Iowa.

The team completed the rest of the season with Jason White, Robby Lyons, and Chad Finley with a best finish of 14th at Talladega with Lyons.
The team returned for the 2019 season with Josh Reaume at Daytona where he would pick up a 6th-place finish, he would return at Atlanta and finish 30th. When the entry list for the Las Vegas race was released it was revealed YouTube personality MrBeast would sponsor Reaume although the truck was not run and ended up finishing 23rd. At Martinsville the next week Daniel Sasnett was tabbed to drive while also making his debut, he would end up finishing 30th. Reaume had originally planned to run the entire season, but could not find sponsorship and put other drivers in the No. 33 for some races. Experienced dirt racer Mike Marlar drove the No. 33 at that year's Eldora Speedway race. He finished fourth, marking the best finish for an RBR entry up to that point.
In 2020, Jason White, Gray Gaulding, Akinori Ogata, Bryant Barnhill, Josh Reaume and others drove the No. 33 car. White kicked off the season with a 10th in the NextEra Energy 250, but the team did not score another top 10 all season long. The team's only other top 20 was an 18th at the Daytona Road Course, with Bryan Collyer behind the wheel, who was making his debut.
White returned in 2021 for the first two events of the season in the NextEra Energy 250 and the BrakeBest Select 159. NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Myatt Snider ran in the inaugural Pinty’s Dirt Truck Race, finishing 22nd, and Cameron Lawrence made his series debut in the Texas Grand Prix. He was running in the top 10 and then suffered mechanical problems, dropping him to last, 8 laps down.
Truck No. 34 history.
The team fielded this truck for Jeffrey Abbey at Eldora Speedway. Abbey qualified the race and finished 12th. The team fielded the No. 34 truck once again at Pocono with J. J. Yeley driving where he finished 31st. The truck returned at Michigan with B. J. McLeod where he finished 29th.

Muthaiga

Muthaiga is an affluent neighborhood in the city of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. In 2019, media reports indicated that it was the most affluent and most expensive neighborhood in the entire country.
Location.
Muthaiga is located approximately , by road, north of the city's central business district. The geographical coordinates of Muthaiga are:01°14'57.0"S, 36°49'54.0"E (Latitude:-1.249167; Longitude:36.831667).
Overview.
The neighborhood is predominantly residential, with meticulously manicured lawns surrounding resort-style mansions, sitting on parcels of real estate measuring one acre or larger. The plots and homes are large and are developed according to strict neighborhood guidelines established by the first British settlers in 1901. Security is maintained by the Kenya Police and a number of private security farms. Land alone, depending on location and terrain costs anywhere from KSh150 million to KSh200 million (US$1.5 million to $2 million) per acre, as of October 2019.
History.
In 1901, John Dawson Ainsworth, the first sub-commissioner in charge, followed the railway to establish a new town at "Mile 327", the name adopted by railway engineers for Nairobi.
Ainsworth, began to entice settlers to come to Nairobi. One of the earliest settlers who was lured by Ainsworth was "Sandbach Baker". Baker, with his wife, "Marie ‘Queenie’ Vera" established "Homestead Farm" on the over that he was granted by Ainsworth. The farm supplied dairy to Nairobi.
In 1903, Marie Vera Baker, who was in charge of Homestead Farm, leased to other settlers, the first of whom was "James Archibald Morrison". In 1912, due to Sandbach’s failing health, the Bakers sold Morrison the whole of Muthaiga. At that time it measured . It fetched £20 an acre then. The Bakers returned to England. Morrison then began to subdivide the land into 10 acre and 50 acre lots, put in roads and piped water. He was a pioneer real estate developer.
The 1,600 acres that the Bakers were deeded in 1901 were part of the Karura Forest, an important cultural forest for the Kikuyu. The land was given to the Bakers, on condition that they supply dairy to Nairobi.
One of the modern amenities established by Morrison, the first real estate developer, is Muthaiga Country Club, opened in 1914, which still exists today. The name "Muthaiga" was coined by Ward, one of the co-owners of "Henderson and Ward Architects", the group who designed the neighborhood plan in 1912. The plot that the architect bought had an African greenheart tree, whose bark was used as medicine by the Kikuyu, so he named the neighborhood after that tree.
The house previously owned by the Bakers is now Gertrude’s Children’s Hospital.
Notable residents.
Several prominent individuals have their residence in Muthaiga including: (a) Jimmy Wanjigi, a wealthy, politically-connected businessman.  (b) Mwai Kibaki, the 3rd President of Kenya (December 2002 – April 2013 (c) Ngina Kenyatta, wife of the first president of Kenya (c) Manu Chandaria, Kenyan billionaire-industrialist.

Richard Pennefather Rothwell (May 1, 1836 – April 17, 1901) was a Canadian-American civil, mechanical and mining engineer. He was the co-founder of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and was awarded the gold medal at the Paris Exposition, in 1898, by the Soeiete d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale de France, as founder and editor of "The Mineral Industry".
Early years and education.
Richard Pennefather Rothwell was born May 1, 1836, at Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada. He studied in early life at Trinity College, Toronto, the Rensselaer Institute at Troy, New York, and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris.
Career.
His professional practice in France and England, and his subsequent career as civil, mechanical and mining engineer in Pennsylvania, from the year 1866 to 1873, prepared him for his later work as editor, writer and manager of statistical and scientific publications. Rothwell already was known as an accomplished writer on engineering and mining topics when, in 1874 he became an editor, and afterward the owner of "The Engineering and Mining Journal". 
Later, he formed The Scientific Publishing Company, and in 1893, began the publication of "The Mineral Industry", which fulfilled his ideal of an annual that would cover the whole field of the world's mineral production and the world's mining and metallurgical progress. Rothwell was eminently fitted to organize and advance this undertaking. He possessed a quick perception of the value of material for publication, an extraordinary memory and a keen sense of fitness and preparation. While he possessed in an eminent degree the power of broad generalization, few men could analyze a compilation of figures so quickly or give to statistical results so clear and compact a form. He laid the lines on which "The Mineral Industry" had been carried forward, and it was primarily due to his good judgment and management that the book from the first possessed a value, which was generally acknowledged as scarcely without parallel in statistical and technical literature.
Rothwell was one of the three founders of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. He was awarded the gold medal at the Paris Exposition, in 1898, by the Soeiete d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale de France, as editor of "The Mineral Industry". 
He organized The Sophia Fund, which was incorporated in May 1900, as a memorial to his long-time employee, Sophia Braeunlich, with a donation of about , a part of which was contributed from moneys left by Braeunlich.
Personal life.
Rothwell married Bertha Hillebrand in 1862.
He died at his residence in New York City, on April 17, 1901.

Wang Ming-chen

Wang Ming-chen (, November 18, 1906 – August 28, 2010) was a Chinese theoretical physicist and a professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing. As one of the first few Chinese female students studying science abroad, she was best known for her work on stochastic process and Brownian motion with George Uhlenbeck as well as the first female professor of Tsinghua University according to some source.
Wang Ming-chen and her cousin He Zehui were sometimes separately credited as "The Chinese Madame Curie".
Biography.
Wang was born into a large prominent family in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province on November 18, 1906 (or the 3rd day of the 10th month of year Bingwu / the 32nd year of Guangxu in the Qing dynasty of the Chinese Lunar Calendar) Her siblings include several renowned Chinese scientists, physicians, and engineers, who pursued western education in the early 1900s. Wang was also among the first Chinese female students, who received undergraduate education in Christian schools Ginling College, Nanjing (first and second year) and the Yanjing University, Beijing (third and last year). She also received her master's degree from Yanjing University in 1932.
According to her own autobiography, after missing two scholarship opportunities from Barbour Scholars, the University of Michigan and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study physics abroad because she was unable to afford the transportation and gender discrimination, she eventually arrived at the US to study theoretical physics at the University of Michigan in 1938, under another application of Barbour Scholars. She taught at Ginling College from circa 1932 to circa 1937, but fled Nanjing for Wuhan on the eve of Japanese invasion of the city (see Nanking Massacre). She moved to the Shanghai branch of Ginling College circa January 1938.
She received her PhD in 1942 in the University of Michigan and published several papers in the area of statistical mechanics with George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit. During the war time (1943–1945), she worked on noise in MIT Radiation Laboratory. It was then she published the paper "On the Theory of the Brownian Motion II" with Uhlenbeck. James L. Lawson and Uhlenbeck also acknowledged Wang in the preface of "Threshold Signals", a book from the "MIT Radiation Laboratory Series", which published the researches of the lab.
After the war, she returned to China in 1946 and became a professor of the mathematics and physics department at Yunnan University from 1947 to 1949. She married scholar Yu Qizhong () in 1948. In 1949, due to the Chinese Civil War, Wang decided to go back to the US and worked in the University of Notre Dame with Eugene Guth until the Korean War broke out. She resigned from Notre Dame and eventually returned to China in 1955. She was not allowed to return to China despite application was filed in circa 1953, as the US was in the McCarthyism period, as well as she had worked in sensitive research area. Nevertheless her husband was allowed to leave or stay with her from 1953 to 1955.
In 1955, Wang became a professor of physics at Tsinghua University, Beijing and taught statistical physics and thermodynamics until the Culture Revolution started in 1966. In 1966, Wang was suddenly arrested and imprisoned until 1973.
Her husband Yu was also arrested until finally being released in 1975. After the Cultural Revolution ended, the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China announced that Wang and Yu's arrest was completely unjust and was due to political persecution by Jiang Qing, then Mao's wife and a member of the Gang of Four.
Wang retired from Tsinghua in 1976 and lived in Beijing until she died in 2010.
Personal life.
Her younger brothers , , brother-in-law (husband of Wang Shoucan) were members of Chinese Academy of Sciences; her older sister was a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology and president of the Red House Hospital in Shanghai.
Wang Mingzhen's grandmother founded a girl middle school in Suzhou, a predecessor of Suzhou No.10 Middle School, of which Wang was an alumna as well as some of her family members. Wang's father, K.T. Wang (), published the Wang-algebra; according to some historians, K.T. Wang's paper in the "Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy" in 1911, was one of the earliest papers by a Chinese scientist to appear in a foreign journal.

King's Bridge, Belfast

King's Bridge is a road bridge across the River Lagan in South Belfast, Northern Ireland. It opened in 1912 and is named after King George V. Made of reinforced concrete, it is believed to be the first road bridge of this type in Ireland.
The bridge forms part of a one-way system along with the neighbouring Governor's Bridge. Together they connect the Stranmillis and Annadale Embankments, with King's Bridge carrying traffic from the former to the latter.
History.
King's Bridge was built to connect Sunnyside Street to the east with Ridgeway street to the west. Stranmillis and Annadale Embankments weren't built until the 1920s. It was constructed by W.J. Campbell &amp; Son for Belfast Corporation to a design by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company of Westminster. It was originally intended to build the bridge at an angle across the river in line with the two streets, but this was ruled out by the Belfast Harbour Commissioners due to the greater effect this would have had on barge traffic.
Structure.
The bridge uses the Kahn system of reinforced concrete, which consists of steel bars of a diamond cross section within the concrete. The bars are bent upwards to provide additional strength. It crosses the river in four spans, with a total span of . The bridge has a width of , with two traffic lanes, and a pavement on each side.

Erebia fletcheri is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Altai to Northeast Yakutia, Sayan, Transbaikalia. Amur) that belongs to the browns family. It resembles "Erebia dabanensis" but in "fletcheri" the reddish yellow borders of the ocelli of the forewing are merged on both sides to form a broad russet band. On the hindwing the small ocelli are widely separated from one another. The median band on the underside of the hindwing is dark and somewhat prominent in, while in "fletcheri" it is of the same dark brown colour as the rest of the wing, so that only the edges of this band are visible as two finely dentate black curved lines. It is found in July between Kurai and Bashkaus.

Birds of Chicago

Birds of Chicago is an Americana/folk band founded in March 2012 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band is led by husband and wife, JT Nero and Allison Russell. Russell is formerly of the Canadian roots act Po' Girl. The duo-fronted band refers to their music as "secular gospel".
Nero, a Midwesterner with strong family ties to Chicago, Illinois, has made the Windy City his home since 2002. Russell grew up in Montreal and has lived with Nero in Chicago since 2009. In 2014, Russell gave birth to their first daughter and hit the road with her four weeks later.
History.
Prior to officially forming Birds of Chicago in March 2012, Nero and Russell were in other musical projects. Russell first began collaborating with Nero on his solo project, "mountains/forests" in 2011, while she continued with Po' Girl. Nero was also in another band, JT and the Clouds. The two developed a working relationship, as Po' Girl and JT and the Clouds traded shows across the Canadian/US border – Po' Girl would open for JT and the Clouds in the States and vice versa. In 2007, Nero opened as a solo act for Po' Girl's international "Home To You" CD release tour, their last record under Nettwerk Records in Vancouver.
Forming Birds of Chicago.
At that point, Nero and Russell started getting serious about working together after their experience of recording "mountains/forests" together in 2011. They began by calling themselves 'JT Nero and Allison Russell' and doing duo shows here and there. They started incorporating and collaborating with various members of their extended musical families – many alumni of JT and The Clouds – and felt they needed a name that would better describe the musical collective they were creating. Birds of Chicago was the name they chose for their first studio album and decided to make that their band name.
The band self-released their album, self-titled "Birds of Chicago", in June 2012 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. They played guerilla-style showcases at Folk Alliance in Memphis, Tennessee in February 2012, just before the album's release. They then started touring 200 days out of the year. Among their first performances were sets at Delfest, Strawberry Festival, and High Sierra Festival. Their first national tour saw them opening for Sean Hayes in October–November 2012. Throughout 2013 and 2014, they toured North America, parts of Europe, and the United Kingdom.
Marriage, touring and further recordings.
In 2013, the duo were married and had a baby girl, Ida Maeve, touring through most of Russell's pregnancy. They hit the road at the end of January 2014 with their daughter who was only 4 weeks old . The Netherlands was her first tour, and then across the US and Canada. On December 5, 2014, they released their live record, "Live From Space" recorded at Evanston S.P.A.C.E. in Evanston, Illinois, just outside Chicago, Illinois.
In 2015, Joe Henry (Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris &amp; Rodney Crowell, Elvis Costello, Allen Toussaint, Ani DiFranco) agreed to produce their next record. They feverishly putting another Kickstarter campaign together met their initial 40K goal in just nine days. The final amount ended up being almost 81K. The success of the campaign allowed them to hire Sacks and Co. as publicists and make their first national press push. They recorded their forthcoming album, "Blue Midnight" throughout 2015 at Joe Henry's Garfield House, which had been his main studio for a decade. It was the last project in the Garfield House—a bittersweet experience. In 2016, Birds of Chicago released their second studio album, 'Real Midnight', also produced by Henry The album garnered the band's first NPR coverage in February.
In 2017, Birds of Chicago signed with Signature Sounds Recordings in Massachusetts, releasing their label debut on November 17, "American Flowers", a digital-only EP. The recording was produced by Jim Jam and Borgo Entertainment (aka Norene and Ben Lindsay) and Koitz International (aka Gretchen, David, and Kevin Koitz). In 2018, the band released their third studio album, "Love In Wartime", produced by Luther Dickinson and Nero himself.
Additional project, indefinite hiatus.
In 2019, Russell collaborated with three other established musicians in recording "Songs of Our Native Daughters", an album addressing a range of American socio-historical issues, including slavery, racism and misogyny. The album, on the Smithsonian Folkways label, also features MacArthur Fellows "genius grant" recipient Rhiannon Giddens; Leyla McCalla, who with Giddens was a member of the group Carolina Chocolate Drops; and Amythyst Kiah, a Tennessee alt-country blues singer and banjo player. Russell wrote two of the album's 13 songs and co-wrote five others. Her contributions also included lead and backing vocals, as well as 5-string banjo and percussion.
After relocating to Nashville, Russell and Nero announced in February 2021 that Birds of Chicago would go on "indefinite hiatus" in order to focus on the release of Russell's solo album, 'Outside Child.'
Accolades.
In 2014, Paul Kerr of Blabber 'n' Smoke included "Live From Space" on his "Best Of" list. The album was also named one of 2014's best country albums by The London Telegraph, describing it as "An atmospheric live album from Birds of Chicago, which captures the stylish music of JT Nero and Allison Russell, whose self-titled, debut album last year was such a treat."
2016 proved to be a big year for the band. Paste Magazine premiered their first single "Real Midnight," the title track of their 2016 release, calling the band an "Americana gospel dream team." For the month of March, "Real Midnight" was #1 on the Euro-Americana Chart, and NPR included their "Dim Star Of The Palisades" single on "Heavy Rotation: 10 Songs Public Radio Can't Stop Playing" on March 8.
NPR's Folk Alley included "Real Midnight" in their top 10 favorite albums of the year, coming in at #6; and it also landed #1 on Josh Hurst's All For The Sake of the Song's Favorite Albums of 2016 list.
In 2017, Slant Magazine named "American Flowers" 19 on their "25 Best Singles of 2017" list.

Styx (film)

Styx is a 2018 German-Austrian drama film directed by Wolfgang Fischer. It was screened in the Panorama section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.
Plot.
Rike is a German emergency doctor. For her holiday she decided to sail alone on her twelve-metre long yacht "Asa Gray", on a trip in the footsteps of Charles Darwin from Gibraltar to Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. During her journey off North Africa, she is informed by a container ship passing nearby that she must prepare for a severe storm on her way.
After the violent storm that night, she discovers a damaged and overloaded trawler near her boat. Containing over a hundred people, threatened with death by drowning, they wave and shout towards her yacht. Rike tries to contact the boat by radio. When she does not receive an answer, she tries to contact rescue teams and organise the rescue. However, the requests for help remain largely unanswered at first, although several vessels can be seen nearby on the onboard radar. Coastguards are warned and promise help, but this will take many hours. The captain of the transport ship, who had promised support before the storm, informs him that his shipping company has prohibited any involvement in the rescue at sea of refugees.
Through her binoculars, Rike notices passengers falling or jumping into the water. A 14-year old boy swims and reaches the yacht. With the help of a lifebuoy, she rescues the exhausted boy from the water and hoists him onto her ship. The boy's name is Kingsley, which is written on his wristband. Rike moves away from the trawler, so as not to provoke further attempts, as her boat is too small to accommodate all the passengers. She gives first aid to Kingsley, bandages his wounds, and puts him on an IV drip. She calls the coastguard again by radio, who promise her that help is on its way and that she must stay away from the refugee boat.
Kingsley, who speaks some English, regains consciousness and tries to pressure Rike to come to the rescue of the trawler on which, among others, her sister is on. He struggles with Rike to get the ignition key to the yacht, even pushing her overboard. After starting the engine and moving somewhat away, Kingsley stops the engine again, and Rike climbs back on deck with difficulty. Shocked by this act, she is furious with Kingsley, but notices his despair and calls the coastguard again, claiming that the "Asa Gray" will sink now. After the SOS, she cuts the ship's electrical system and activates her distress beacon.
The following night, she approaches the trawler, climbs aboard and finds a number of dead and dying people on the ship.
At dawn, the tenders of a Coast Guard frigate shuttle with the abandoned trawler to rescue the survivors and recover the dead, while radio messages about other ships in distress arrive, each with hundreds of refugees on board. Rike is recovered from the frigate. Traumatised and unable to answer the questions of the coastguards who questioned her, she is informed that proceedings were being brought against her.

Arnoldstein Abbey

Arnoldstein Abbey ("Stift Arnoldstein") was a Benedictine abbey in Arnoldstein in Carinthia, Austria. Its church was dedicated to St George and first mentioned in historical records in 1316 - its choir, tower, west door and a few buttresses can still be seen. The monastery buildings from the Gothic and 17th century eras were arranged around the church in an oval.
History.
Origins.
Arnoldstein is named after its founder Arnold, probably a ministerialis of the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg but not evidenced elsewhere. He first built it between 1085 and 1090. The Bishopric had only been founded in 1007 and to mark his coronation on 10 February 1014 Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor had granted it various possessions in Carinthia, including in the area of what is now the market town of Arnoldstein. Under the Bishop of Bamberg Adalbero of Eppenstein (1053-1057) the Eppsteiner family were the bishopric's vassals. However, they did not give the property back to Adalbert's successor but instead founded a castle in what is now Arnoldstein to fortify the 'Kanaltal' region. Only under bishop Otto of Bamberg soon after the turn of the century did the bishopric regain these lands. 
To keep Arnoldstein in church hands, Otto founded a Benedictine monastery there in 1106. He had the castle demolished and converted into the monastery complex as well as leaving the abbey 155 'Huben' or farmsteads to finance its continued existence. The abbey's first recorded abbot was Ingram, appointed in 1126 - prior to that it seems to have only been a priory. In 1126 its cemetery was opened. It also had early troubles with the governors - among others the lords of Ras misused their role as the abbey's protectors and so in 1176 it was made a direct bailiwick of the Carinthian dukes.
14th to 16th centuries.
A poor harvest, a plague of locusts and finally a massive landslide on the Dobratsch caused by the 1348 Friuli earthquake led the abbey into economic problems - it lost buildings, its church and the village of St. Johann to the landslide. Documents show it began to recover until 1391, although the local population continued to decline, probably also due to the Black Death. In 1391 the Patriarch of Aquileia handed the abbey the parish of Hermagor to try to stem its financial problems, but this and further privileges, donations and foundations were not enough to pay off its debts. In the 15th century it even found it difficult to look after the parish of Hermagor and this led it into a dispute which involved the first witch trial in Carinthia, which occurred in the Grünburg Landgericht court in Hermagor in 1465. 
Abbot Christoph allowed Jakob Fugger and his brothers to build a metal-separating works and a fortress on abbey lands in 1495, which became the foundation for the Fuggerau complex. Abbot Friedrich complained in 1507 that the abbey had fallen into dilapidation and poverty and during the Reformation it was on the verge of dissolution, with its reputation weakened by the taxes on the princes to fund the war against the Ottoman Empire, its quarrels with nobles and subjects and its neglect of its pastoral duties. Despite the bishopric's edicts to the contrary, Lutheran preachers occupied the abbey and Thörl as well as the neighbouring fortresses. In 1570 abbot Petrus entered into a bond for 2500 guilders in installments to buy back the Fuggerau with all its lands and rights, since it had declined as a mining operation but still needed to be kept out of the hands of the neighbouring nobles, who might well go over to Protestantism at any moment.
In 1580 the abbey was without an abbot for a short period - the Franconian Johannes Pünlein was appointed that year but according to the archpriest's visitation report in 1594 he led a completely secular life, only holding one mass a year with a single monk, maintaining an entourage that was entirely Protestant, using neither vestments nor candles in church and no adornments on the altar. His successor was another Franconian, Emerich Molitor, who could not fulfil the bishopric's hopes of re-catholicising the abbey. Embezzlement led to a loss of 60,000 guilders. 
17th century to present.
In a bull by Ferdinand II of Tyrol of 12 April 1600 the abbey was finally connected to a Jesuit college set up at St. Veit, but the bishop of Bamberg was finally able to avert this by instead promising a contribution to the college's costs. After the free election of abbot Daniel in 1630 the abbey began to flourish once again until a major fire in October 1642, in the wake of which its funds were invested in buildings and equipment. 
When the Patriarchate of Aquileia was dissolved and Bamberg's lands sold off to Austria in 1759 the abbey came under the princes' direct control. IN 1782 Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor decided to abolish all monasteries in Austria that did not make a direct contribution to education or nursing. He originally wanted to save Saint Paul's Abbey, Lavanttal but his advisors convinced him that abolishing Arnoldstein Abbey would do less damage. A court decree thus abolished it on 24 November 1783, with abbot Otto von Größing and 18 priests there allowed to choose becoming parish clergy or to switch to another monastery. The abbey's buildings and lands were transferred to the state and its library was transferred to the Klagenfurter Studienbibliothek, now known as the library of the University of Klagenfurt. Part of the abbey archives went to the Geschichtsverein für Kärnten and is now in the Carinthian National Archives (Kärntner Landesarchiv) in Klagenfurt. The abbey's rooms were used as government offices, rented and even (until 1854) used to house elementary school teachers. 
The 1848 administrative reforms turned them into offices for the forestry administration, the district courts, the tax offices, the land registry, the notaries and the town council. Another fire on 16 August 1883 destroyed the buildings' wooden rooves and ceilings but the administration was unwilling to raise funds to repair them and so they were left to fall into ruin. The grounds were acquired by the "Revitalisierungsverein Klosterruine Arnoldstein" association on 16 August 1883

Plot.
Anabel is hosting a large dinner party and recognises one of the catering staff as Chiara, the daughter she has not seen since she abandoned her at the age of eight over thirty years ago. She arranges to meet Chiara to find out why she has re-appeared. Chiara requests that she spend 10 days with her. Anabel's husband and the family lawyer are suspicious of Chiara's motives, but after she agrees to sign a contract waiving any rights she had as a family member, they agree to the plan. Before leaving, Anabel informs her other, younger, daughter that she has a half-sister, who then asks her to be kind to Chiara.
Chiara drives Anabel into the countryside to a remote community where she lives in her childhood home. During the following days the tensions build between the two women, and Chiara refuses to reveal what she wants to achieve, saying that she doesn't need or want to forgive Anabel. Chiara becomes drunk during a party at the local town and passes out for over a day. After giving Anabel some magic mushroom infused tea, she tells her that she is seriously ill. The next day, during an excursion on a sled, Chiara becomes sick and is taken to hospital. Anabel is told the extent of Chiara's condition by the staff.
They return home and Anabel asks Chiara how she can help her. Chiara states that she only wants one thing and if Anabel won't do it she can leave. She whispers in Anabel's ear and immediately afterwards Anabel packs her belongings and departs. She travels to Paris and meets with Chiara's father. They discuss their previous relationship in dispassionate terms, before the conversation turns to Chiara. Her father said that he offered to help her but she refused. Anabel returns to the farmhouse and finds Chiara collapsed but conscious nearby. She tenderly undresses her and carries her into the lake. Chiara says that she is not afraid and Anabel slowly lowers her into the water, holding her under until she stops struggling.

Old Main Library (Albuquerque, New Mexico)

The Old Main Library is a historic building in the Huning Highlands neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico, originally built in 1925 as the main facility of the Albuquerque Public Library. Since the opening of the current Main Library in 1975, it has served as the library system's Special Collections branch, housing historical and genealogical research materials. Designed by Arthur Rossiter with interior decorations by Gustave Baumann, the building is a notable example of Pueblo Revival architecture. It was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1975 and is also an Albuquerque Historic Landmark.
History.
The Albuquerque Public Library opened in 1901, operating out of a former school building called Perkins Hall which was donated to the city by Joshua and Sarah Raynolds. By the 1920s, the building was considered to be obsolete and a campaign to build a new library was spearheaded by a coalition of local women's groups called the Women's Library Association. One of the project leaders was the well known writer Erna Fergusson. In 1923, voters approved a bond issue for construction of the new library, and the City Commission put the project up for bid the following year. In accordance with the wishes of the WLA, the building was to be of a "typically southwestern" architectural style.
The new library was built on the site of Perkins Hall using salvaged brick from the old building. The Pueblo Revival style building was designed by Arthur Rossiter, with interior decorations by Santa Fe artist Gustave Baumann, and opened to the public on March 23, 1925. Further additions were made in 1947 and 1951. In 1975, a new Main Library was built in Downtown Albuquerque, and the old building was re-purposed to house the library's Special Collections, encompassing local history and genealogy research materials. The interior underwent restoration projects in 1978 and again in 2010–12, and the building was named a city historic landmark in 1979.
Architecture.
The Old Main Library is a one-story Pueblo Revival style building with battered, stuccoed walls, exposed vigas, and buttressed corners. The main facade features square corner towers and a curved parapet with a bell. The turquoise-painted, Prairie style windows are another notable feature. The original 1925 building has been partly obscured by later additions, though these were designed to harmonize with the existing architecture. The interior of the original portion of the library features a single large room with low partitions. Interior details include heavy wooden columns and beams, two corner fireplaces, and murals by Gustave Baumann.

Shuttlecraft

A shuttlecraft, also known as a shuttle spacecraft, shuttle ship, drop shuttle, drop spacecraft, or dropship, is a type of spacecraft described in theory and science fiction. Serving the same purpose as a ship's tender, it is a smaller vessel that is launched from a mother ship, and has the ability to transport people or cargo between ships, or to and from a planet's surface without being damaged or destroyed. It has a secondary purpose as an evacuation ship if the mother ship is destroyed. While the Space Shuttle was envisioned to make this type of craft a reality and reduce the cost of going into space, it ultimately failed in its goal and expendable launch systems remained a more cost-effective option.
Examples.
The idea of a shuttle craft used for space travel first appeared in "The Great Romance" (1881), where it was called the "Midge" and was used to explore Venus. These types of craft later became a mainstay of science fiction. The use of the word "shuttle" was taken from nautical terminology.
The idea was later used in "Star Trek", where they are called shuttlecraft. Similar craft are also used by the Visitors in "V", and a more military-styled version known as the "Cheyenne"-class dropship was used in "Aliens" (1986), popularizing the use of the term to refer to shuttles that serve the same purpose as military transport aircraft.
Usage in video games includes the drop shuttles from "Mass Effect" and the Pelicans and dropships from "Halo", as well as the Terran dropship unit in the "Starcraft" series. 
Use of shuttlecraft has seen widespread use by all the major factions in the Star Wars franchise. There are numerous variations on the concept within the Star Wars Expanded Universe, but the main uses include use as: drop-ships, boarding craft, assault landing craft, and as non-combat personnel transports.
Hypothetical usage.
The use of shuttle ships was proposed as a means for economical transport to Mars. People would ride a shuttle to a mother ship in orbit around the Sun, which would not need to slow down. This would increase the speed of travel from Earth to Mars, being able to transport hundreds of people at regular intervals.

Tinea conspecta

Tinea conspecta is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Alfred Philpott in 1931. However the placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as "Tinea" (s.l.) "conspecta". This species is endemic to New Zealand.

Shaw's Bridge

Shaw's Bridge is the name given to two adjacent bridges across the River Lagan in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The older of the bridges is a historic stone arched bridge, which is open to cyclists and pedestrians. The new bridge is a concrete bridge which carries the A55 road.
Old Bridge.
The crossing is located at a shallow section of the Lagan, which had historically been used as a crossing point. A bridge was first built in 1655 by Captain John Shaw of Oliver Cromwell's army. This bridge was made out of oak and replaced with a stone bridge in 1698. The first stone bridge was destroyed by flood and replaced with the current bridge in 1707.
The bridge is composed of five stone arches: four across the river and one across the adjacent footpath. Its deck is only wide enough for one lane of traffic. Despite this, it was an important connection for many years, carrying the main road from Belfast to County Down and Dublin. The construction of the A55 road rendered the bridge obsolete, and in 1977 it was pedestrianised, along with its approach roads. It now forms part of the Lagan Valley Regional Park.
New Bridge.
In 1977, a section of the A55 road was opened across the Lagan Valley. The road forms Belfast's outer-ring road, and crosses the Lagan on a specially constructed bridge, 20m downstream of the existing bridge. This bridge, also referred to as "Shaw's Bridge", is a concrete arch bridge which crosses the river and the footpaths on either side in one 70m span.
In popular culture.
The old bridge is depicted in a painting by Belfast-born artist John Luke. In 2018, the bridge and adjacent boat house were both featured in BBC drama "Come Home".

2018 National Women's Soccer League season

The 2018 National Women's Soccer League season was the sixth season of the National Women's Soccer League, the top division of women's soccer in the United States. Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, Women's Professional Soccer (2009–2011) and the Women's United Soccer Association (2001–2003), it was the twelfth overall season of FIFA and USSF-sanctioned top division women's soccer in the United States. The league is operated by the United States Soccer Federation and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing is provided by the Canadian Soccer Association. Both national federations pay the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations and take the financial burden off individual clubs.
The off-season brought significant changes, with FC Kansas City and the Boston Breakers ceasing operations, while new club Utah Royals FC joined the league. The 2018 season began on March 24, and ended on September 8. Teams once again played 24 regular-season games this year, with the top four teams making a single-elimination playoff. The North Carolina Courage won the NWSL Shield with 15 more points than second place Thorns. The NWSL Playoffs began on September 15 with the two semifinal matches, which were won by the Thorns and the Courage. The NWSL Championship Game was held on September 22 at Providence Park in Portland. The Courage won 3–0, becoming the first team to win both the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship in the same season.

Concord Management and Consulting

Concord Management and Consulting () is a member of the Concord company group, which is half owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin. Based in St. Petersburg, Russia, it owns and operates several restaurants. It is also the parent company of Concord Catering.
The company was founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin in 1995. He was the listed owner until 2009. His mother, Violetta Prigozhin, has been the listed owner since 2011.
"North Versailles" () is a luxury housing development in the Lahti-Primorsky district of St. Petersburg built and managed by Concord Management and Consulting. The development closed a section of Novaya Street to the public by erecting gates with armed guards. This was controversial because city records showed the street as still a public right of way.
Concord Management and Consulting owns 50% of LLC Megaline (). Megaline received most of the capital construction contracts for the Russian military in 2016 in what appears to have been a rigged bidding process. Concord Management and Consulting's lawyers provided a package of amendments to the Ministry of Defense to change the laws in a way that would allow Megaline to bid for the contracts since it otherwise wasn't qualified. The amendments were submitted to the Duma by the government on 11 February 2014, and adopted on 16 April 2014.
On 20 June 2017, The United States Treasury Department added Concord Management and Consulting to the list of companies sanctioned for Russia's military interventions in Crimea and Ukraine.
Dmitry Utkin, also under sanctions, became the CEO of Concord Management and Consulting on 14 November 2017. Utkin is the founder of Wagner Group, a private military contractor. He replaced Anastasia Sautina. Fontanka reference contains an observation that the Concorde CEO has the same exact name up to patronymic as a mercenary leader nicknamed "Wagner" (Dmitry Valer'evich Utkin), but a different INN (unique taxpayer's number, also issued in a different region) This they call a very elaborate trolling. It does, however, contradict much of their earlier findings - the two Utkins not being the same person removes the apparent connection between Prigozhin and mercenary company nicknamed "Wagner"
Indictment.
A February 2018 indictment by the United States Justice Department alleged that Concord Management and Consulting began operations in 2014 with the intention to financially support a group known as the Internet Research Agency which interfered with the 2016 United States presidential election won by Donald Trump.
An initial hearing was in May 2018. On Friday, 16 November, "The Hill" reported a U.S. Federal Judge upholding Robert Mueller's indictment.
Hearings continued throughout the year and into 2019.
A trial date was set for April 1, 2020 but as of March 2, 2020 the court is facing delays in the production of documents needed before trial by attorneys for both Concord and the Department of Justice.
The charges against Concord Management and Consulting were dismissed with prejudice on March 16, 2020. Prosecutors complained that Concord did not submit all information required by the court and going to trial could reveal US investigative "tools and techniques". They added that the US government would have been unable to present some evidence to the court because that would compromise classified material. Concord defense lawyer Eric Dubelier suggested that the indictment was political and said the "evidence was completely devoid of any information that could establish that the defendants knew what they were doing was in violation of highly complex US laws and regulations". "The Financial Times" described the indictment as "a rare mis-step by Mr Mueller", because indicting a corporate entity allowed Concord "to obtain case information, taunt the US in federal court and go to trial with little fear of the repercussions that an individual would face". US prosecutors said the US government would still pursue individual charges against Prigozhin.

Janibacter

Janibacter is a genus of Gram positive, nonmotile, non-sporeforming bacteria. The genus name is derived from the two-faced Roman god Janus, referring to the fact that the cells of the original strain could be rod-shaped or coccoid.
The type species of the genus, "Janibacter limosus", was originally isolated from sludge from a wastewater treatment plant. Other species have been isolated from an air sample, a melon, the midgut of mosquitoes, coral, sea sediment, and hydrothermal sediment. "Janibacter brevis" was originally classified as a separate species, but was later found to be a heterotypic synonym of "J. terrae". 
Colonies formed on agar by members of this genus are usually cream, white, or yellow pigmented. The optimum temperature for most "Janibacter" species is 28 °C. The lowest temperature required for growth in the genus is 4 °C ("J. terrae", "J. anophelis", "J. limosus"), and the highest is 45 °C ("J. terrae", "J. anophelis", "J. corallicola"). The pH optimum is commonly between 7.0-9.0, with some species capable of growing at 5.0-12.0. All species can tolerate NaCl salt concentrations up to 7%, but "J. alkaliphilus" can tolerate concentrations of 17%. "J. hoylei", which was recovered from high altitude air samples, is the most UV resistant.
"Janibacter" species have been implicated in multiple cases of human infection, although most cases appeared to be opportunistic infections. An unnamed "Janibacter" species caused an infection in a man with acute myeloid leukemia after receiving a bone marrow transplant. "J. melonis" infected a man's face after being bitten by an unknown insect. "J. terrae" infected four immunocompromised patients, resulting in two deaths, and also caused a psoas abscess that was difficult to diagnose due to the infrequency of "Janibacter" infections. An 8 week old infant was found to be infected with "J. hoylei", but was successfully treated with vancomycin. "J. massiliensis" was isolated from the vaginal discharge of a woman with bacterial vaginosis.

<doc id="56606480" url="?curid=56606480" title="Fugitive gas emissions">
Fugitive gas emissions

Fugitive gas emissions are emissions of gas (typically natural gas, which contains methane) to atmosphere or groundwater which result from oil and gas or coal mining activity. In 2016, these emissions, when converted to their equivalent impact of carbon dioxide, accounted for 5.8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.
Most fugitive emissions are the result of loss of well integrity through poorly sealed well casings due to geochemically unstable cement. This allows gas to escape through the well itself (known as surface casing vent flow) or via lateral migration along adjacent geological formations (known as gas migration). Approximately 1-3% of methane leakage cases in unconventional oil and gas wells are caused by imperfect seals and deteriorating cement in wellbores. Some leaks are also the result of leaks in equipment, intentional pressure release practices, or accidental releases during normal transportation, storage, and distribution activities.
Emissions can be measured using either ground-based or airborne techniques. In Canada, the oil and gas industry is thought to be the largest source of greenhouse gas and methane emissions, and approximately 40% of Canada's emissions originate from Alberta. Emissions are largely self-reported by companies. The Alberta Energy Regulator keeps a database on wells releasing fugitive gas emissions in Alberta, and the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission keeps a database of leaky wells in British Columbia. Testing wells at the time of drilling was not required in British Columbia until 2010, and since then 19% of new wells have reported leakage problems. This number may be a low estimate, as suggested by fieldwork completed by the David Suzuki Foundation. Some studies have shown a range of 6-30% of wells suffer gas leakage.
Canada and Alberta have plans for policies to reduce emissions, which may help combat climate change. Costs related to reducing emissions are very location-dependent and can vary widely. Methane has a greater global warming impact than carbon dioxide, as its radiative force is 120, 86 and 34 times that of carbon dioxide, when considering a 1, 20 and 100 year time frame (including Climate Carbon Feedback Additionally, it leads to increases in carbon dioxide concentration through its oxidation by water vapor.
Sources of emissions.
Fugitive gas emissions can arise as a result of operations in hydrocarbon exploration, such as for natural gas or petroleum.
Often, sources of methane are also sources of ethane, allowing methane emissions to be derived based on ethane emissions and ethane/methane ratios in the atmosphere. This method has given an estimate of increased methane emission from 20 Tg per year in 2008 to 35 Tg per year in 2014. A large portion of methane emissions can be contributed by only a few "super-emitters". The annual ethane emission increase rate in North America between 2009 and 2014 was 3-5%. It has been suggested that 62% of atmospheric ethane originates from leaks associated with natural gas production and transportation operations. It has also been suggested that ethane emissions measured in Europe are affected by hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production operations in North America. Some researchers postulate that leakage problems are more likely to happen in unconventional wells, which are hydraulically fractured, than in conventional wells.
Approximately 40% of methane emissions in Canada occur within Alberta, according to the National Inventory Report. Of the anthropogenic methane emissions in Alberta, 71% are generated by the oil and gas sector. It is estimated that 5% of the wells in Alberta are associated with natural gas leaking or venting. It is also estimated that 11% of all wells drilled in British Columbia, or 2739 wells out of 24599, have reported leakage problems. Some studies have estimated that 6-30% of all wells suffer gas leakage.
Well-specific and processing sources.
Sources can include broken or leaky well casings (either at abandoned wells or unused, but not properly abandoned, wells) or lateral migration through the geological formations in the subsurface before being emitted to groundwater or atmosphere. Broken or leaky well casings are often the result of geochemically unstable or brittle cement. One researcher proposes 7 main paths for gas migration and surface casing vent flow: (1) between the cement and adjacent rock formation, (2) between the casing and encompassing cement, (3) between the casing and the cement plug, (4) directly through the cement plug, (5) through the cement between casing and adjacent rock formation, (6) through the cement between linking cavities from the casing side of the cement to the annulus side of the cement, and (7) through shears in the casing or well bore.
Leakage and migration can be caused by hydraulic fracturing, although in many cases the method of fracturing is such that gas is not able to migrate through the well casing. Some studies observe that hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells does not affect the likelihood of the well suffering from gas migration. It is estimated that approximately 0.6-7.7% of methane emissions produced during the lifetime of a fossil fuel well occur during activities that take place either at the well site or during processing.
Pipeline and distribution sources.
Distribution of hydrocarbon products can lead to fugitive emissions caused by leaks in seals of pipes or storage containers, improper storage practices, or transportation accidents. Some leaks may be intentional, in the case of pressure release safety valves. Some emissions may originate from unintentional equipment leaks, such as from flanges or valves. It is estimated that approximately 0.07-10% of methane emissions occur during transportation, storage, and distribution activities.
Detection methods.
There are several methods used to detect fugitive gas emissions. Often, measurements are taken at or near the wellheads (via the use of soil gas samples, eddy covariance towers, dynamic flux chambers connected to a greenhouse gas analyzer), but it is also possible to measure emissions using an aircraft with specialized instruments on board. An aircraft survey in northeastern British Columbia indicated emissions emanating from approximately 47% of active wells in the area. The same study suggests that actual methane emissions may be much higher than what is being reported by industry or estimated by government. For small-scale measurement projects, infrared camera leak inspections, well injection tracers, and soil gas sampling may be used. These are typically too labour-intensive to be useful to large oil and gas companies, and often airborne surveys are used instead. Other source identification methods used by industry include carbon isotope analysis of gas samples, noise logs of the production casing, and neutron logs of the cased borehole. Atmospheric measurements through both airborne or ground-based sampling are often limited in sample density due to spatial constraints or sampling duration limitations.
One way of attributing methane to a particular source is taking continuous measurements of the stable carbon isotopic measurements of atmospheric methane (δ13CH4) in the plume of anthropogenic methane sources using a mobile analytical system. Since different types and maturity levels of natural gas have different δ13CH4 signatures, these measurements can be used to determine the origin of methane emissions. Activities related to natural gas emit methane plumes with a range of -41.7 to -49.7 ± 0.7‰ of δ13CH4 signatures.
High rates of methane emissions measured in the atmosphere at a regional scale, often through airborne measurements, may not represent typical leakage rates from natural gas systems.
Reporting and regulating emissions.
Policies regulating reporting of fugitive gas emissions vary, and there is often an emphasis on self-reporting by companies. A necessary condition to successfully regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the capacity to monitor and quantify the emissions before and after the regulations are in place.
Since 1993, there have been voluntary actions by the oil and gas industry in the United States to adopt new technologies that reduce methane emissions, as well as the commitment to employ best management practices to achieve methane reductions at the sector level. In Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator maintains a database of self-reported instances of gas migration and surface casing vent flows at wells in the province.
Reporting of leakage in British Columbia did not start until 1995, when it was required to test wells for leakage upon abandonment. Testing upon drilling of the well was not required in British Columbia until 2010. Among the 4017 wells drilled since 2010 in British Columbia, 19%, or 761 wells, have reported leakage problems. Fieldwork conducted by the David Suzuki Foundation, however, has discovered leaky wells that were not included in the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission's (BCOGC) database, meaning that the number of leaky wells could be higher than reported. According to the BCOGC, surface casing vent flow is the major cause of leakage in wells at 90.2%, followed by gas migration at 7.1%. Based on the methane leakage rate of the reported 1493 wells that are currently leaking in British Columbia, a total leakage rate of 7070 m3 daily (2.5 million m3 yearly) is estimated, although this number may be underestimated as demonstrated by the fieldwork done by the David Suzuki Foundation.
Bottom-up inventories of leakage involve determining average leakage rates for various emission sources such as equipment, wells, or pipes, and extrapolating this to the leakage that is estimated to be the total contribution by a given company. These methods usually underestimate methane emission rates, regardless of the scale of the inventory.
Addressing issues stemming from fugitive gas emissions.
There are some solutions for addressing these issues. Most of them require policy implementation or changes at the company, regulator, or government levels (or all three). Policies can include emission caps, feed-in-tariff programs, and market-based solutions such as taxes or tradeable permits.
Canada has enacted policies which include plans to reduce emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025. The Alberta government also has plans to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations by 45% by 2025.
Reducing fugitive gas emissions could help slow climate change, since methane has a radiative force 25 times that of carbon dioxide when considering a 100 year time frame. Once emitted, methane is also oxidized by water vapour and increases carbon dioxide concentration, leading to further climate effects.
Costs of reducing fugitive gas emissions.
Costs related to implementation of policies designed to reduce fugitive gas emissions vary greatly depending on the geography, geology, and hydrology of the production and distribution areas. Often, the cost of reducing fugitive gas emissions falls to individual companies in the form of technology upgrades. This means that there is often a discrepancy between companies of different sizes as to how drastically they can financially afford to reduce their methane emissions.
Addressing and remediating fugitive gas emissions.
The process of intervention in the case of leaky wells affected by surface casing vent flows and gas migrations can involve perforating the intervention area, pumping fresh water and then slurry into the well, and remedial cementing of the intervention interval using methods such as bradenhead squeeze, cement squeeze, or circulation squeeze.

Seemaraja

Seemaraja () is a 2018 Indian Tamil-language action comedy film written and directed by Ponram and produced by R. D. Raja. The film stars Sivakarthikeyan in double role and Samantha, Simran with a supporting cast including Soori, Napoleon, Lal, and Keerthy in a cameo appearance. The film features music composed by D. Imman and cinematography by Balasubramaniam. The movie was released on 13 September 2018, coinciding with the festival of Vinayagar Chathurthi. The film was released in Telugu with the same title.
Plot.
The film begins by outlining the sour relationship between the two villages, Singampatti and Puliyampatti. Seema Raja (Sivakarthikeyan) is a rich youngster from Singampatti, born in a Zamindar family with a long lineage of brave Kings; the main one being King Kadambavel (Sivakarthikeyan). He does good things in the village for likes on Facebook and pays other villagers to treat him with respect. He hangs around with his sidekick/accountant Kannaku (Soori). The principal from a nearby school invites Seema Raja's father, Ariya Raja (Napoleon) to the awards ceremony at the school. However, due to his father's busy schedule, Seema Raja offers to go instead. Here, he meets Sunthanthira Selvi (Samantha), a sports teacher and Silambam expert, and immediately falls in love with her. He then goes around following her, trying to court her.
Singampatti and Puliyampatti have been in a grudge over the market square in Puliyampatti for many years. The land was donated 30 years ago by Ariya raja, but was closed off due to a village clash. The grudge has remained ingrained in the villagers, but they have not indulged in any sort of significant violence for a long time. It started again, where some villagers from Singampatti entered the closed market square and began to play cricket. This caused a large fight, which was only put to an end when Seema Raja offered to hold a wrestling match with the other village. Whichever village wins the match gets to have the market square, and the other village is driven out. To make matters worse, to test whether Seema Raja is just severely infatuated or genuinely in love with her and ascertain if he is a good suitor, Selvi tells Seema Raja to lose the wrestling match. Seema Raja is devastated. Seema Raja forms a group of other not serious fighters, whilst Puliyampatti forms a group of very built fighters.
The wrestling match occurs with Puliyampatti beating the first few fighters with ease. Kanakku then comes to the circle, providing himself with the opportunity to show off his toned abs to the public. This match also ends in failure. Seema Raja is the final fighter (i.e. if he lost, Puliyampatti would win). At first, when he sees her, Seema Raja allows the opposing fighter to beat him up, but when she disappears, he proficiently takes down each fighter one by one. Seema Raja wins the match for Puliyampatti, but rather than hog the spoils for his village, and he decides to try and heal the grudge between the two villages by splitting the market square amongst them. This receives support from both villages. Seema Raja begins to gain more respect, and Selvi begins to reciprocate his love.
Kaaleeshwari (Simran) and Kathaadi Kannan (Lal) are two antagonists of the film. Kannan used to be a butcher but then took on the opportunity to purchase vast swathes of land to create wind farms. His greedy plans begin to put agriculture at risk and thus puts him at loggerheads with Seema Raja. A fight between the two ensues with him kidnapping Selvi and imprisoning her at his house. Here, a flashback occurs showing that Selvi was Kannan's daughter with his first wife. He leaves his first wife for Kaaleeshwari, causing his ex-wife to commit suicide by falling into a well. Ariya Raja attempts to stop this rapid acquisition of land. however, the villagers insult him and mock him for not doing anything for the people when they were under his control. This causes him to die of a broken heart. A funeral is carried out for him. Whilst Seema Raja is mourning his death, and his grandfather chastises him for being so irresponsible. He begins to explain Seema Raja's ancestry, starting off with the brave Kadambavel and his wife Bhoomi (Keerthy Suresh). He narrates the stories of Kadambavel's fights against the foreigners, protecting his Tamil land. He explains how he exploited the Vallari, to his advantage to defeat the vast Muslim army, led by Malik Kafur. These stories of sheer chivalry motivate Seema Raja to take on his father's responsibility and become mature.
Seema Raja remains unaware of Selvi's love for him. He goes to court and attempts to allow Selvi to leave the house. However, since she has been blackmailed by Kaaleshwari (if she said she was being held against her will, she would kill her sister), she replied, 'ask my father' to every question that the police asked. The police quashed Seema Raja's case, and he was devastated. However, understanding the double meaning behind it, Seema Raja goes to Selvi's foster father and asks him what Selvi meant by it. Here, he finds out about her love for him. Seema Raja first thwarts Kannan's plan for rapid acquisition by meeting and agreeing on a new deal with the Raj of Udaipur. The detail would enable them to construct a wind farm on their land, whilst also allowing them to farm on the land and receive rent for the land that the wind farm is present on, thus providing them with a sustainable income. At first, the villagers were hesitant, but then, they agreed. Kannan is furious. Seema Raja returns to the house to break out Selvi and run away. Kannan and Kaaleeshwari then realize this and begin to chase them. They again recapture her and prepare to kill her by hanging her from the wind turbine as an act of revenge for thwarting their business plans. Seema Raja arrives in time to save her, and a fight ensures, where Kaaleeshwari is crushed to death by the wind turbine, and Kannan is defeated. Seema Raja and Selvi then happily live together.

Reception.
Critical reception.
"Seemaraja" received negative reviews from critics. Janani.K of Indiatoday wrote "Director Ponram's Seema Raja starring Sivakarthikeyan and Samantha is a pointless rural drama that has nothing new in it. It is a brainless mass film."
Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu says "Director Ponram seems to have clearly missed a trick by trying out to put in too many commercial elements and excelling in none."
Priyanka Sundar of Hindustan Times wrote "This Sivakarthikeyan movie is a colourless comedy."

Praga Super Piccolo

The Praga Super Piccolo was a car produced by Praga in Czechoslovakia between 1934 and 1936.
Design.
Launched at the 1934 Prague Motor Show, the Super Piccolo was designed as a mid-range replacement to the smaller Piccolo which would suit people who did not want the larger Alfa. Of conventional construction, with a rectangular frame chassis with X-shape stiffener, the car was initially produced as a four-door sedan only. This was joined by a small number of two-door Sidomka and Sodomkovy aerodynamic convertibles, but the biggest upheaval came at the 1935 Berlin Motor Show where Praga launched a distinctive aerodynamic sedan. The new model had a more curvaceous shape and covered front and rear wheels. The aerodynamic version was produced alongside the standard sedan.
Powered by a 4 cylinder engine, the car could reach and return fuel economy between .
Production.
The vehicle was instantly popular and over 500 were sold in 1934. However, the price for the car high. The standard car cost 46,500 CSK in 1935, while the aerodynamic sedan was even more expensive at 46,500 CSK. The standard price was reduced to 40,800 CSK in summer 1936 and production ceased before the end of the year.

Sir John Kelk, 1st Baronet

Sir John Kelk, 1st Baronet (16 February 1816 – 12 September 1886) was a British Conservative Party politician, builder and public works contractor.
Family.
Kelk was the son of his namesake, John Kelk, an ironsmith, and Martha, daughter of Jacob Germain. In 1848, he married his cousin, Rebecca Anne, daughter of George Kelk, and together they had five children: 
Construction career.
Buildings.
Kelk started his career, after a commercial education, as an apprentice of builder Thomas Cubitt, with whom he later had fierce competition, and then went into partnership with William Newton. Upon Newton's retirement, he amalgamated the business with another Mayfair builder, John Elger, and then worked on rebuilding houses in Grosvenor Square, and churches St. Michael's Church, Chester Square, and All Saints, Margaret Street.
He also built Kneller Hall in Twickenham, the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, designed by James Pennethorne, from 1849 to 1851, and in 1854 was involved in the reconstruction of the Carlton Club in Pall Mall.
His firm was the main contractor for the Albert Memorial, a task which saw him "striking terror into at least one of the sculptors". This monument, inaugurated in 1872, saw him, and its architect George Gilbert Scott, offered a knighthood; while Scott accepted, Kelk refused, perhaps seeking the baronetcy he later obtained from Benjamin Disraeli on 16 May 1874.
Infrastructure.
He generated considerable wealth in construction relating to railways and docks, acting primarily as the promoter rather than contractor, and handing over the firm to Smith and Taylor, his foremen, in 1862. During this period, he built the Commercial Dock Company's south dock in Rotherhithe, and was a partner in the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, which produced the Royal Navy's first seafaring ironclad warship HMS Warrior in 1860, and the ironwork for Blackfriars Railway Bridge and Hammersmith Bridge.
Alongside these, he built the Millwall Dock with John Aird &amp; Co., but this venture caused significant financial difficulty after the crash of Overend, Gurney and Company. The project was only abled to proceed after help from Tower Hamlets MP Acton Smee Ayrton.
His most notable construction work, within his railway projects, was the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway across the River Thames, built from 1858 to 1860 with John Fowler. Together, they also enlarged Farringdon station in 1863, to allow for the Metropolitan Railway, and Smithfield meat market goods depot. They were both also involved with Peto and Betts, and Waring Brothers, in building railway lines for the Metropolitan Railway between South Kensington and London Paddington station, and Metropolitan District Railway between Tower Hill and South Kensington, from 1864 to 1871.
South Kensington Museum.
Kelk's firm also built the early buildings of the South Kensington Museum – now the Victoria and Albert Museum – including the Sheepshanks, Turner, and Vernon galleries, as well as its north court, south court, and lecture range.
1862 exhibition.
Kelk was instrumental in the construction of buildings for the 1862 International Exhibition, working with Lucas Brothers to erect the buildings for a lower than anticipated cost of £300,000 on the site of the now Natural History Museum. When the financing of the exhibition came under doubt, largely due to the death of Prince Albert, he offered to meet the shortfall.
Alexandra Palace.
When dismantled, elements of the exhibition buildings were used for the creation of the Alexandra Palace, intended to be a rival to the Crystal Palace. Kelk's palace was designed by Owen Jones, but its architect was John Johnson; Lucas and Kelk provided a third of the finance required, with the remaining funds being provided by the London Finance Association, and some by an entrepreneur named Rodonachi who later withdrew from the project.
When the palace was destroyed by a fire in 1873, just a month after it had opened, Kelk lost a considerable amount of money. Nevertheless, the palace was rebuilt and re-opened on 1 May 1875.
Political career.
Kelk was elected MP for Harwich in 1865 but did not seek re-election when the seat was reduced to one member in 1868.
Other activities.
Having attained considerable wealth, Kelk bought Bentley Priory at Stanmore, and Tidworth sporting estate in Hampshire. At the latter, John Johnson was employed to extend Tedworth House and to rebuild St Mary's Church in 1878 to 1879. He again worked with Johnson to rebuild 3 Grosvenor Square for his own abode.
Kelk was a Major in the Engineer Volunteer Staff Corps, and became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1861, a Justice of the Peace (JP) and Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex, and a JP and High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1884.
He died at his home, Tedworth House, on 12 September 1886, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery under a ledger-stone of the pink granite also used in the Albert Memorial.

Housing insecurity in the United States

Housing insecurity is the lack of security in an individual shelter that is the result of high housing costs relative to income, poor housing quality, unstable neighborhoods, overcrowding, and, but may not include, homelessness.
Terminology.
Housing insecurity cannot be understood from a single definition and it requires background, relevant terms, and risk factors to demonstrate how it affects the United States; there is no standard definition for housing insecurity and it results in multiple definitions from multiple researchers. There has been a goal set by those interested in identifying a national definition of housing insecurity, similar to that of food insecurity. Researchers argue that it is difficult to study the effect of housing insecurity because it has been defined in so many different ways. A unified definition could help standardize the research on housing insecurity in addition to allowing individuals the opportunity to gain knowledge on existing public programs they can benefit from.
Housing insecurity.
A group of researchers from the University of Southern California propose a measure of housing insecurity that takes into consideration the "seven dimensions of housing insecurity", which are identified as housing instability, housing affordability, housing safety, housing quality, neighborhood safety, neighborhood quality, and homelessness. These several aspects of housing are used to describe the severity of a housing situation, with homelessness identified at most severe. For bedrooms, each household head is allocated two rooms, married couples (or single occupants) are allocated one room and every two children are allocated one room One bathroom is for every four people.
The Department of Health and Human Services has defined housing insecurity by taking into account proportion to income, housing quality, neighborhoods, overcrowding, and homelessness.
The Center for Disease Control used the frequency of responses to the question of, "How often in the past 12 months would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent/mortgage? Sometimes, usually, or always?", to identify those who are housing insecurity and to assist in their research on disease prevention.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines housing insecurity based on multiple factors in the unit based on the quality of the house. Based on answers on the American Housing Survey, they deem people housing insecure and the house inadequate based on these structural conditions:
Housing affordability.
Housing affordability is defined as the ratio of annualized housing costs to annual income. Different income based measures use different thresholds; however most organizations use either the 30% or 50% threshold, meaning that an individual is housing insecure if they spend more than 30% or 50% of their annual income on housing.
Housing safety.
Housing safety is defined as a housing issue that presents an imminent health threat, such as inadequate heating capacity, faulty foundation, evidence of rodents, exposed electrical and more. Housing quality is defined as housing that is substandard but does not pose an imminent health risk, such as no cooking unit, no hot/cold water, no drinking water, faulty sewage, and more.
Neighborhood safety.
Neighborhood safety is defined as living in a neighborhood that presents imminent health threats, such as a factory is located within half a block, unit is in a flood plain, unsatisfactory police presence, and more. Neighborhood quality is defined as households in neighborhoods with undesirable characteristics that do not pose an imminent health risk, such as poor city/county services, unit is boarded up, roads need repairs, no stores within fifteen minutes, and more. Homelessness in the United States is defined as "households who define housing type at the time of interviews as either tent, cave, railroad car, unspecified housing unit, a boat, an RV, or an unoccupied site for a mobile home, trailer or tent." If an individual meets one of the above criteria, then they are considered housing insecure under this definition.
Adequate housing.
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which the United States is a signee, includes the right to adequate housing. They define adequate housing as having security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location, and cultural adequacy. Many of these tenants are similar to the ones above, such as availability of services (neighborhood quality), affordability, habitability (housing quality and housing safety), and location (neighborhood safety and neighborhood quality).
Additional terms.
The UN defines security of tenure as having tenure security which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment, and other threats. They define accessibility as taking into account the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups. They define cultural adequacy as respecting and taking into account the expression of cultural identity. If housing does not meet any of these criteria, it is considerate inadequate, or housing insecure.
Rates.
The various forms of housing insecurity have been studied in order to find which life circumstances lead families to housing insecurity. Associations between unreliable housing and factors such as race, income, and family type are especially clear. Housing insecure households are likely to consist of unmarried people. 57% of housing insecure households are made up of unmarried individuals that do not have children.
The second largest category is unmarried households with children, which makes up 21% of the distribution. 63% of housing insecure households are extremely low income, which means their annual income is less than the Federal Poverty Level or 30% of the Area Median Income. Most people facing housing insecurity are not seniors and are renters. A lack of education has an especially evident association with housing insecurity. Within housing insecure households, 18% of individuals have a bachelor's or graduate degree, while 50% have no college experience. 55% of housing insecure households are white.
Rates of housing insecurity are fairly consistent across the United States. For the majority of states, between 10% and 15% of households are housing insecure. Wyoming has the least housing insecurity while California and New York have the most housing insecurity; 20% of households face housing insecurity.
In regards to rates of housing inadequacy defined by the American Housing Survey, the number of housing units that were considered extremely inadequate fluctuated between 2005 and 2009.There were 2,021,050 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2005, 1,805,960 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2007, and 1,863,660 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2009. The average number of extremely inadequate units for these three years, 1,896,890 units, amounts to less than 2% of the total number of housing units in the United States. The characteristics that most frequently made units deemed extremely inadequate were shared plumbing facilities (55%) and unacceptably long cold periods (29%). 91.6% of extremely inadequate units experienced only one of the listed qualities of an extremely inadequate unit.
Risk factors.
Race/Ethnicity.
Those who experience housing insecurity are found to be majorly composed of minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics, who are twice more likely than whites to experience housing insecurity. Due to their lack of jobs and opportunities, these populations were unable to afford housing even without agreements and restrictions. Around the 1800s, they experiences overcrowding "into tenement housing lacking sanitation, fire safety, and adequate light and ventilation" which using the multiple definitions defined, this is considered housing insecurity.
Impacts.
Housing insecurity in the United States has many impacts for the housing insecure. Through cross-sectional analyses, researchers in the 2010s have found several negative factors; yet they acknowledge that it is not currently possible to pinpoint the exact causes and effects. The absence of a valid measure or universal definition for housing insecurity may be a possible reason for lack of research. Despite these implications with research, findings across the board suggest housing insecurity is a negative risk factor when it pertains to health and educational attainment.
Health.
In a study that analyzed data from the 2011 Washington State Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, 29.4% of the 8,416 respondents reported being housing insecure. Housing insecure respondents were approximately "twice as likely to report poor or fair health status" compared to those who did not report being housing insecure. Approximately one third of the housing insecure respondents reported delaying doctor visits due to the costs. 26.9% of the housing insecure respondents were current smokers and "26.3% had poor or fair health".
Through an additional cross-sectional analysis from the 2002 National Survey of America's Families, "housing instability was independently associated with postponed medical care, postponed medications, and increased emergency department visits". Other health outcomes that have been associated with housing insecurity by past studies include: probable GAD, depression, and PTSD.
Education.
A longitudinal study assessed the academic achievements of children suggesting there is a link between housing insecurity and performance in school. Researchers reported that homeless and highly mobil children were more likely to be at risk for low academic achievement compared to other students.
Some scholars conclude the aforementioned achievement gaps with homeless and highly mobile students tend to be chronic and "may worsen among older grade cohorts." Highly mobile students were also linked with having "increased rates of grade retention" and more "school-related problems such as expulsion or suspension", compared to other students.
Assistance.
One source of assistance is locally located public housing agencies (PHAs) that distribute section 8 vouchers. The vouchers are funded by the U.S. government, specifically the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. These vouchers help low income families or individuals pay for their rent. The PHA determines eligibility based on income, family size and citizenship. Most families that qualify are put on a waitlist, and once they get a voucher, they must be able to find their own housing, and it must meet the safety requirements of the PHA. Once the family meets all the standards, the PHA may partially pay the landlord for the family's rent, requiring the family to pay the difference, or depending on the situation, the PHA may pay for a reasonably priced home.
The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) aims to create housing stability in the U.S. by increasing affordable housing and supporting government funded homes. The organization consists of 5 teams: the Research Team, the Policy Team, the Field Team, the Communications Team, and the Administration Team. The Research Team looks at statistics of housing insecurity, and the Policy Team helps inform policy makers about these trends. The Field Team raises awareness and the Communications Team gathers input from the general population about their views of housing insecurity. Finally, the Administration Team oversees the organization and regulates progress. These 5 groups all come together to combat housing insecurity.
Enterprise is another organization that has a plan to end housing insecurity by 2020. Their goal is not only to provide for low income families, but to also improve their psychological and physical well being. They have 5 pillars that they focus on: homes, systems, connections, resources, and foundation. Their objective is to provide affordable housing with systems that will provide equal opportunity for low income families. Enterprise also looks for opportunities to expand resources in the government to help those in need. Enterprise's 5 pillars come together to shape their main goal of becoming the foundation that will be strong enough to end housing insecurity.

The Disability Rag

The Disability Rag (also known as "Ragged Edge" magazine) was a periodical published between 1980 and 2004 as a subscription-based print publication, and as an online publication from 1997 to 2007. In addition to covering the U. S. disability rights movement, "The Rag", as it was usually called, published a wide range of articles and opinion pieces from individuals with disabilities. It was considered one of the most important publications of the disability rights movement. The not-for-profit Advocado Press was incorporated in 1981 to serve as publisher of "The Rag". The Advocado Press also published a number of books and monographs on disability issues.
Early history.
"The Disability Rag's" first issue - a 4-page bifold produced at a quick-print shop - published in January, 1980 in Louisville KY, with both news items for the local disability activism community in Louisville and a first-person account of "living like a refugee" as a person with a disability. The publication was the effort of two Louisville women who were active in local disability organizations: Cass Irvin, a polio survivor who believed that "there needed to be some way for [disabled] people to connect" and Mary Johnson, who was non-disabled and had a background in public relations. In 1994 Irvin was cited as one of 50 "American Heroines" by the Ladies Home Journal, in part for her work with "The Rag". After a few years "The Rag" began to get national attention due to the efforts of Irvin, who was active in the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD).
Content.
"The Disability Rag's" national growth was accelerated in 1985 by a front page "Wall Street Journal" article. As it became a national periodical of the disability movement, it addressed the disability community's concerns about both personal and public issues. "The Rag" was a hybrid: both a news magazine, with coverage of emerging activism local and nationwide, and an opinion journal. In an era before social media, its articles by leading disability rights figures and a large and lively letters to the editor section debated the disability rights policy issues of the times as activists proposed, argued about and worked out ideology and strategies. "The Rag" covered the full range of disability political issues from charity telethons to physician assisted suicide to protests over inaccessible public transit. When ADAPT started a national activist effort to change public transit policy, "The Rag" provided continuing coverage of the activists and the issue, and the coverage was collected and published as "To Ride the Public's Buses: The Fight that Built A Movement", The Advocado Press's first ""Disability Rag" Reader."
Another ongoing issue for "The Rag" was media coverage: it consistently railed against or poked fun at what it considered detrimental or misguided coverage of disabled people. Two ongoing features of the magazine - "Myth &amp; Media" and "We Wish We Wouldn't See..." - critiqued the typical coverage of disabled people as either heroes and "overcomers" or victims of disease, and skewered ads for cosmetic surgery or from fundraising charities which used disability as tragedy to open purse strings.
It urged readers to view themselves not as victims of tragedy but survivors facing discrimination and barriers, which could be removed by society. It urged its readers to wake up to the fact that their lives could be better without cures if they would just fight for access and accommodation. The recurring cartoon feature "Disability Rat," kept up the theme. The Wall Street Journal told readers about the "wheelchair-riding rodent who, irked at having his handicapped-parking space swiped, blows up the offending vehicle." And "The Rag" was not shy about pointing out the value of its ideology: "Start Reading "The Rag" and start to think" was a slogan of early subscription ads.
Role in self-identity and culture.
"The Rag" served as a national forum as activists and leading thinkers and scholars of disability rights submitted articles and reacted to items and reader letters published in "The Rag", and it grew to become an important outlet for creative expressions of disability culture, including essays, fiction, poetry and artwork reflecting the experience of disability. (In 1994 The Advocado Press issued an anthology of much of this writing as "The Ragged Edge" anthology.). Mike Ervin, reviewing the book in "The Progressive" magazine, called "The Rag" "the gimp-radical's bible."
Many disabled people first learned about disability culture through "The Disability Rag", including Stephen E Brown, who wrote that ""The Disability Rag" published stories by kindred spirits" and noted that he "wanted to write for it one day."
Bob Ruffner, then the director of public affairs for the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, called "The Rag" "a strong voice for those who may not be associated with a lot of well-organized groups.
"It's very forceful in arguing that disabled people should get their heads out of the clouds and confront society with their needs," he said, adding that "utopian ideas - ideas that can be translated into social action - start in places like "The Rag".
"How else can you build a movement among people who have been left out? Its purpose is to build a fire," he told "The Washington Post" in 1986.
Criticisms.
"The Rag" was considered "well left of center on the political spectrum." Because of its "take no prisoners" tone, "The Rag" was frequently criticized. Some felt its "strident, shoot from the hip approach" was counterproductive; that its accusatory tone diminished the impact of its message. Other readers complained that it lacked humor.
Many had serious reservations about the ferocity of its disability pride message, which they felt went too far when it eschewed the concept of cure. The fact that "The Rag" celebrated disability to the extent that it frequently took stances against charity appeals for cures, such as telethons, rubbed critics the wrong way.
And because "The Rag" was not loath to call out those in the disability movement whom it considered "Uncle Tiny Tims" or opinions of leaders that it considered bad disability politics, disability movement activists fumed when they found themselves in firing range.
Growth and changes.
As "The Rag's" reach grew, it hired a circulation manager and acquired an office. By 1990, The Advocado Press employed several staff members, for both editorial and circulation, for "The Rag".
Mary Johnson, "The Rag's" longtime editor, left in 1993 and the editorship passed to Dave Matheis. Barrett Shaw took over as editor in 1994, to be succeeded by Eric Francis in 1996. In 1997, Johnson returned as editor and remained in that position until print publication ceased at the end of 2004.
In 1989 "The Disability Rag" changed its masthead to "The Disability Rag and Resource", and in 1995 changed its name to "Ragged Edge" magazine at the launch of its website, Ragged Edge Online. It began experimenting with color covers, and grew to around 6,000 paying subscribers.
Fundraising efforts by its nonprofit Advocado Press starting in the mid 1980s resulted in a number of financial gifts both from longtime members and various progressive and activist groups. The Advocado Press received grants for its work on media and disability.
The Advocado Press published "Reporting on Disability: Approaches and Issues" (1989) "Strange People with Books" (by Nancy Gall-Clayton, 1990), and "Media Savvy: A Self-Training Curriculum" (1991), as
"The Rag's" coverage of the "bus battle' was later anthologized in the Advocado Press first Disability Rag Reader, "To Ride the Public's Buses: The Fight that Built A Movement"
"The Ragged Edge" magazine published as a periodical through 2003. In 2004, the Advocado Press published three larger issues called "Ragged Edge Readers" and at the end of 2004 ceased print publication, although the Ragged Edge Online website continued to feature new material for two more years. The complete Ragged Edge Online site is available through archive.org.
Awards and recognitions.
In 1993 "The Disability Rag" won the "Utne Reader" Alternative Press Award for Best Special Interest Publication: The magazine was "cogent, outspoken, and joyfully resistant to stereotyping, its pages feature scathing satire and clearheaded thinking," according to Utne.
In 1998 "The Ragged Edge" anthology was named an "outstanding book on the subject of human rights in North America" by the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Rights.
Online presence.
The Ragged Edge website launched in 1997 as "The Electric Edge" before settling on "Ragged Edge Online." Besides offering digital editions of the print publication, the Rag website offered news updates and expanded discussion of trending topics in the disability rights movement, and blog posts by disability activists.
Archive.
A complete list of Advocado Press titles still in print can be found online. Its complete periodical archive and many of its titles are available online from Alexander Street Press. In 2015, the organizational papers and archives of The Advocado Press including the periodical archives were acquired by the Bancroft Library.

Dangerous Intentions

Dangerous Intentions is a 1995 American drama television film, directed by Michael Toshiyuki Uno. It aired January 3, 1995 on CBS.
Plot.
For years, since the wedding and marriage, Beth Williamson (Donna Mills) tolerated the abusive behavior of her husband, Tim (Corbin Bernsen). She refuses to disclose the battering to her family or friends, and manages to keep her bruises hidden from her young daughter, Laurie (Alexandra Purvis). One day, Beth has had enough and decides she can no longer live her life as a recipient of Tim's rage, so she and Laurie move into the home of her parents. While at her parents' home, Beth, along with her sister Terri (Allison Hossack), is helping out with her dad Andrew (Ken Pogue) and step-mother Alice (Anna Ferguson), but a phone call comes from Tim, who tells Beth to come home, but Beth tells him that she is not finished fixing Alice's hair. Beth hangs up on Tim. Later that night, Beth and Laurie return home, and Tim apologizes to Beth and pleases her.
Later that day, after Terri and Laurie leave before returning, Beth tries to please Tim, but she finds out that he becomes violent and destroys the food and treats it like garbage and abuses her. She also finds out he bad-mouths her and that he destroys the window, causing her to cry and also causing her to clean up this mess. Behind Tim's back, Beth takes Laurie with her and heads to Andrew and Alice's house, but is later found by Tim. Laurie gets Andrew and Alice thanks to Beth, and a violent Tim beats up and abuses Beth after locking the door on Andrew who calls the police on him. Tim unlocks the door and surrenders to police who arrest him and send him to jail, while a shocked Alice helps Andrew send Beth to the hospital.
Laurie arrives, and Beth comforts her and reminds her that Tim will not see them or hurt them ever again. In a public building, after Tim is released from jail, Beth is found by Tim, but she tells him to leave her alone, that she wants a divorce and does not want him anymore. Not letting Beth look for her keys, Tim takes them and reminds her that she will lose Laurie to him and lose her life forever. Tim calls Terri on the phone and tries to talk to his ex-wife Beth, but Terri tells Tim to leave Beth alone. Tim promptly resumes terrorizing Beth, as he tracks her to her sister's home and sets the house on fire. Terri and her husband put out the fire with the fire extinguisher and save their house.
Beth must flee with Laurie to a protective shelter, a move she has long avoided. Here, Beth meets and becomes close friends with Kaye Ferrar (Robin Givens), a battered woman who has been hiding from her violent husband Joe Ferrar (Tracey Olson) for several years. The two women decide to move into a house together with their children, where they feel they can protect one another and establish their freedom.
Just when stability returns to their lives, Kaye's husband, Joe, finds them, and stabs Kaye to death right before Beth's eyes. Reeling from her friend's violent death, Beth receives a double shock when officials inform her that she must testify against Joe who is arrested for and accused of murder. Though Beth wants to bring Joe to justice, she fears that testifying will bring her into the public eye, making it easy for Tim to discover her whereabouts.
Moving to a new house in Roseville, Beth and Laurie start a new life after her divorce from an abusive Tim. Beth cuts her own hair short and colors it from blonde to red. As Beth protects Laurie and herself from Tim, Alice reminds Tim to leave her and Beth and Laurie alone and give them some space, and bans Tim from her house.
While Laurie is at school, Beth's ex-husband Tim arrives one last time to stalk Beth again, but Beth begs him not to hurt Laurie. By saying she was cold and needed to get a sweater, Beth manages to turn on the porch light. Tim berates Beth for taking Laurie from him. Laurie tries to return home but is sent to her neighbor's house by her neighbor who saw Beth's porch light on which was a signal that she was in danger. Her neighbor calls the police on Tim, who tries to hurt Beth. When Beth slaps Tim and tells him to go to hell, he beats her up and chokes her. Tim tries to use his own gun to kill Beth either by shooting her in the heart or in the head, but police arrive just in time, warning Tim to drop the gun. Realizing he has already failed in both getting Laurie for himself and for attempting to kill Beth, Tim is forced to drop the gun and again surrender, releasing Beth and allowing himself to be arrested by police who slap him in cuffs for spousal abuse and domestic violence. Beth recovers and is reunited with Laurie who rides with her and the paramedics in the back of an ambulance that takes them to the hospital, while police send Tim back to jail, likely for good this time, finally giving Tim what he rightfully deserves.
Beth and Laurie live happily ever after with each other and with Alice, Andrew, and Terri who visit them.

Conejo en salmorejo

Conejo en salmorejo ("rabbit in Canarian marinade") is a meat dish from the Canary Islands. The main ingredient is rabbit meat that is marinated, then sautéed and finally cooked in the marinade until done.
In addition to the meat the rabbit's liver is often used as well. Base of the marinade are white wine (usually dry), olive oil and often vinegar that are mixed with garlic, bayleaf, bell peppers and thyme. Additional ingredients are used according to personal taste. As side dishes, usually "papas arrugadas" are served, unskinned small potatoes that are cooked in salty water. Alternative side dishes like rice, bread or french fries are not uncommon.
Conejo en salmorejo has a high awareness level on the Canary islands and is named a signature dish of the Canarian cuisine. The origin of the dish is unclear, some sources trace it to Aragon. The Andalucian vegetable soup salmorejo is not related.

Goole Times

The Goole Times is a weekly newspaper for Goole, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It is the oldest and longest serving weekly newspaper in the county of Yorkshire.
History.
"The Goole Times" was established in 1853 and covers the town of Goole and surrounding villages. It is the longest standing newspaper in Yorkshire. The title is owned and published by Chronicle Publications, along with its sister paper the "Selby Times".
The success of the "Goole Times" prompted Chronicle Publications to launch the "Selby Post" in November 1999. In August 2013 the company acquired the "Selby Times" newspaper title, which was then owned by Johnston Press. The two titles were merged under the title of the "Selby Times".
19th century.
The "Goole Times" was first founded in 1853 as a monthly newspaper. By 1869 it had become a weekly paper and was called the "Goole and Marshland Weekly Times". It then took on a name change 10 years later and was called "The Goole Weekly Times".
20th century.
In 1987 the paper amalgamated with the "Goole and Howden Chronicle" (founded in 1983), initially as the "Goole Times and Chronicle" and then later that year as the "Times and Chronicle". It adopted its present title in 1997. For the latter half of the 20th century, the editor position was filled by Ernest Butler. Extracts and clippings of the "Goole Times" archive from 1915 to 1990 are held at the town's Waterways Museum.
Present day.
Editor Peter Butler was at the helm of the "Goole Times" from 2000 until 2010. Butler had secured a job at the paper when his father Ernest was the editor and was employed by the company for around four decades. He handed the reins to the paper's current editor Jane Rogers who became "not only the newspaper’s first woman editor in 157 years, but its youngest at the age of 31".
Butler's father Ernest Butler joined the editorial staff of the "Goole Times" as a reporter in 1928. Butler became managing editor and director of the paper in 1969 after returning from serving in Royal Corps of Signals during the Second World War.
In 2014, despite the shift to online news, The "Goole Times" was only three newspapers in the country to actually increase print sales. "The Goole Times" (incorporating the "Selby Times") saw a rise of more than three quarters to 15,045 compared to the same period in 2013.
The paper was shortlisted for 'Best Weekly Newspaper' in the 2017 O2 Media Awards for Yorkshire and Humber. It was also finalists in the 'Team of the Year (print)' category at the awards in 2015. The team was made up of "Daily Telegraph" reporter Tom Kershaw who began his newspaper career at both of the titles in 2013.
Natalie Kershaw, the paper's deputy editor since 2018, received a nomination for 'Weekly News Reporter of the Year in September 2016 at the same annual O2 Media Awards ceremony.
"The Goole Times" and "Selby Times" received an unprecedented 1,000 toys for their annual Christmas toy appeal in December 2017.
The weekly paper ran a front-page story to help stop their town of Goole 'being cut in two' after their subway underneath Goole railway station floods in heavy rain. Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy later posted a copy of the paper to Network Rail asking for them to pledge work to fix the issue.
Reporter Ashley Pemberton, originally from Warrington, was the first reporter to have two different stories splash on both the Selby Times and Goole Times in the same week. He went on to dizzying heights in his journalism career, achieving a front page splash on the Daily Star on December 11, 2020 for a story on how the Prime Minister declared the World Pie Eating Championship would be cancelled. 
In July 2019, "The Goole Times" owners Chronicle Publications decided to launch a third newspaper, "The Epworth Times". This was following the closure of "The Epworth Bells" and "Crowle Advertiser" after 147 years by owners JPI Media. 
Rogers described the new paper as "dedicated news pages to Epworth, Crowle, Haxey, Keadby, Belton and the surrounding areas" while expanding their current Crowle patch, which is covered in the "Goole Times".
Investigations.
A covert investigation was launched by the "Goole and Selby Times" papers to snare paedophiles in the local area during summer 2016. The three month-long project was headed up by a team of reporters following a similar successful project undertaken by rival paper the "Hull Daily Mail". "Selby Times" reporter James Morris posed as an underage girl and was immediately targeted by pervert, and ex-army officer, Paul Handley. Handley was snared in a sting by Morris, who created fake profiles and posed as an underage girl on an online chat room. He told Handley while posing as the girl he was 14-years-old. Handley arranged to meet the ‘girl’ after being tricked by Morris posing as a teenager on a social-networking site. Handley later received a suspended sentence almost a year after he attempted to meet Morris.
Controversy.
A complaint against the "Goole Times" had to be resolved in 2000 after the then Goole MP Ian Cawsey helped a constituent complain about the coverage of a young man's death. The then PCC Press Complaints Commission, which was later renamed the Independent Press Standards Organisation, deemed the paper's brief article about the death of Norman Woollass's son broke clause 5: Intrusion into grief and shock. The editor published an apology to the complainant.
In October 2013, the "Goole Times" published a picture of Sacha Baron Cohen while portraying the character Borat instead of the new Goole AFC owner Baron Bloom.

Renato Mariotti

Renato Mariotti is an American attorney, legal commentator, acting fill-in anchor for WGN-TV and former federal prosecutor. On October 26, 2017, he announced his candidacy for Illinois Attorney General, but he lost in the Democratic primary election.
Early life.
Mariotti was born in Chicago to working-class parents and graduated from Naperville Central High School in 1994. He earned a B.S. in political science from the University of Chicago in 1998 and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 2001.
Career.
After law school he clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals and practiced antitrust and securities litigation at Heller, Ehrman, White &amp; Mcauliffe LLP from 2002 to 2007.
From 2007 to 2016 he worked for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, where he prosecuted white-collar crimes including commodities and securities fraud, health care fraud, mortgage fraud, and tax evasion.
Mariotti prosecuted the infamous Bogdanov crime family, which was turned into an episode of CNBC's American Greed. Mariotti also convicted the "Second Hand Bandit," Jose Banks, who later escaped from prison and threatened to kill him. That case was also made into an American Greed episode. Mariotti was also responsible for indicting and convicting real estate mogul Laurance Freed for defrauding the City of Chicago, banks, and his business partner.
In 2015 Mariotti was the lead prosecutor in a financial spoofing case against financier Michael Coscia, "United States v. Coscia", a groundbreaking commodities fraud case. This was the first criminal conviction of a high frequency trader. Mariotti explained financial "spoofing" to the jurors as a type of scam in which stock traders create computer programs to create fake buy and sell orders that flood the markets and move price in a direction that profits the scammer.
In 2016 he joined Thompson Coburn LLP, where he handles government-related financial cases.
Before announcing his candidacy for Illinois Attorney General, Mariotti was widely known as a commentator on legal issues pertaining to current events, with a large following on Twitter and regular appearances on MSNBC. His quotes and writings have appeared in the "New York Times", "Time", the "Washington Post", "Newsweek", and "Politico", and he has made many television appearances on MSNBC, CNN, and CBS News.
Candidacy for Illinois Attorney General.
Mariotti ran as a Democrat to succeed Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who is retiring in 2018. In an interview with the "Chicago Sun-Times" he said his priority as attorney general would be economic justice: "People like my parents who are working hard and struggling to make ends meet, things haven't gotten better [for] them. Since the '80s or '90s, they have continued to struggle, [while] people at the top who are taking advantage of them are getting richer." He also pledged to focus on the problem of wage theft, estimating that over 50 million dollars in wages had been illegally withheld from workers in Illinois. Mariotti lost to State Senator Kwame Raoul in the March 20, 2018, primary election.

Erebia kefersteinii

Erebia kefersteini is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Altai, Sayan, Tuva, North Mongolia.) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
kefersteini. Er. (36 b) is nearest to "melampus" and of the same size. The central area inclusive of the cell is brown-red, the base and the costal, distal and hindmargins being black-brown. In the male the reddish yellow distal band, which is divided into 6 spots by the veins, contrasts in colour but slightly with the central area and proximally gradually disappears in the latter. There are small black pupils in spots 2, 3 and 4 counted from the costal side. The underside is lighter, more greyish brown, the markings being as above. Among the few specimens examined there is one which essentially differs in markings: The forewing is black-brown, being centrally but little dusted with brown; the black dots are completely absent from the band of both wings. In the female the forewing is dark brown , the cell being more or less filled in with red-brown. There are 4 — 5 black ocelli in the spots of the transverse band, and the hindwing bears 4 red-brown ovate spots with black dots.

Caleuche Awards

The Caleuche Awards () are Chilean honors given to reward the acting profession for the best performances of the season, in movies, television serials, series and miniseries, and comedies. They were created and organized by the Corporation of Actors of Chile (Chileactores), in conjunction with VTR.
The awards are given according to a vote of all members of Chileactores. A jury chooses the nominees in leading and supporting performances in each one of the four categories: Cinema, TV Serial, TV Miniseries or Series, and Comedy.
The first awards ceremony was held on 25 January 2016 at the .
Award.
Every year, the prize organization holds an open contest for plastic artists in the area of sculpture, design, or other related disciplines, for the fashioning of the award to be presented to all winners at the ceremony. The statue designed for the first edition was made by the outstanding Chilean sculptor . This was inspired by the bodily expression of the acting profession, and conceived according to the etymology of the word "caleuche", which means "people who are transformed".
Categories.
There are 13 awards given within the four main categories. In addition, recognitions of Career and Breakthrough are made with two special prizes.

Kinar (film)

Kinar (Well in Malayalam), titled Keni () in, is a 2018 Indian drama film co-written and directed by M. A. Nishad. It was produced by the studio of Fragrant Nature Film Creations, and was made simultaneously in Malayalam and Tamil. Focusing on the issue of water scarcity in a town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the film stars Jayaprada and Revathi, with different sets of ensemble cast for the two versions. M. Jayachandran and Bijibal composed the soundtrack and score. Noushad Sherif was director of photography and Sreekumar Nair edited the film. Both versions were released worldwide on 23 February 2018 to negative reviews and were box-office bombs.
Production.
Directed by Malayalam filmmaker M. A. Nishad, the story revolves around a water dispute that crops up between the people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala on account of a well, with the film taking place in 1965 when Kerala was formed as a separate state. Jayaprada revealed that her political experience of seeing people through problems of water scarcity motivated her to sign the film and play the lead role. Portraying the widow of a geologist, who wants to fulfil her husband's desire to make water available to all, she stated the story "fell in the category of ‘meaningful cinema’" and that she was keen to be a part of such attempts. Revathy was signed to portray a collector of the Tamil Nadu village of Thirunelveli, which faces a water shortage every year. She was selected after the original choice, Suhasini opted out citing date issues. Nishad chose to shoot two versions, one in Malayalam and the other in Tamil, where each party would have the stronger cause.
The Malayalam version of the film was shot first during May 2017, with most of the scenes being shot at the Punalur Municipality and Chemmanthur High School premises. Scenes were also shot in Thiruvananthapuram during the same month, where a launch ceremony was held. The film was later shot in Tamil with Parthiban, Nassar, Anu Hasan and Rekha amongst others joining the cast.
Soundtrack.
The film features a song titled "Ayya Sami", sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and K. J. Yesudas, who worked together after a break of twenty seven years following "Thalapathi" (1991) for the song "Kaatukkuyilu Manasukkula". The song's lyrics narrates the celebration of Tamil Nadu and Kerala cultures, and was composed by M. Jayachandran and written by B. K. Harinarayanan and Palani Bharathi. The soundtracks were released simultaneously at an event on 7 February 2018, with the lead cast in both languages in attendance.

Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate

Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate refers to substratum loanwords from unidentified non-Indo-European and non-Uralic languages that are found in various Finno-Ugric languages, most notably Sami. The presence of Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate in Sami languages was demonstrated by Ante Aikio. Janne Saarikivi points out that similar substrate words are present in Finnic languages as well, but in much smaller numbers.
The number of substrate words in Sámi likely exceeds one thousand words.
Borrowing to Saami from Paleo-Laplandic probably still took place after the completion of the Great Saami Vowel Shift. Paleo-Laplandic likely became extinct about 1500 years ago.
The Nganasan language also has many substrate words from unknown extinct languages in the Taimyr peninsula.
Theories.
Some theories about the origin of the substrate in Sami languages link it to the unattested languages of post-Ahrensburgian cultures (Komsa &amp; Fosna-Hensbacka cultures). According to Aikio, the speakers of the Proto-Samic language arrived in Lapland around 650 BC and fully assimilated the local Paleo-European populations by the middle of 1st millennium AD. In his opinion, the detailed reconstruction of these languages is impossible.
The languages of more eastern post-Swiderian cultures might have influenced Finno-Ugric languages as well. According to Peter Schrijver, some of these substrate languages probably had many geminated consonants. Vladimir Napolskikh has attempted to link them to the hypothetical Dené–Caucasian language family, but later had to admit that these substrate words have no apparent parallels in any known language on Earth. 
Yuri Kuzmenko tried to compare them to the hypothetical Pre-Germanic substrate words, but found no similarities apart from the distinction between central and peripheral accentuation. 
Some examples of Kildin Sami words and corresponding Northern Sami cognates without convincing Uralic/Finno-Ugric (or any other) etymologies:
Most of these words have cognates in all Sami languages. A more extensive list of such words can be found in G.M. Kert's 2009 work on Sami toponymics. Semantically, pre-Sami substrate consists mostly of basic vocabulary terms (i.e. human body parts) and nature/animal names, and lacks terms of kinship and societal organization, which suggests a rather low level of socioeconomic development in pre-Sami cultures.
Some possible substrate words can also be found in Finnish.
Finno-Volgaic substrate.
There are also some examples of possible substrate words in Finno-Volgaic languages that differ from the Pre-Sami substrate, i.e. Proto-Finno-Volgaic "*täštä" "star", or "*kümmin" "ten".
Some words in Finno-Volgaic languages contain rare consonant clusters, which suggests loanwords from unknown languages. 
Finnish words such as jauho (eng. flour), lehmä (cow), tähti (star), tammi (oak) and ihminen (human) could be substrate words.
Toponyms.
Some toponyms in Finland appear to be of non Uralic origin, for example a word "koita" regularly appears on narrow and long hydronyms, thus it is probably the continuation of the native word for "long, narrow".
Many other toponyms in Finland seem to come from a substrate language or from many substrate languages, these are Saimaa, Imatra, Päijänne and Inari.
There are also toponyms from a substrate language in Sápmi, for example an ending ir (&lt; *-ērē), is commonly found in mountains, which is probably the continuation of the substrate word for mountain.
Other such toponymic words are 'watershed', *čār- ‘uppermost (lake)’, *- ‘isolated mountain’, - ‘mountain top on the edge of a mountain area’, *sāl- ‘large island in the sea’, - ‘seashore cliff’, and *inč- ‘outermost island’.
Languages.
Because there are irregularities in Saami substrate words, they might have been borrowed from distinct, but related languages. In the west, the substrate languages probably had an s-type sibilant which corresponds to an š-type sibilant in the East.
Because we only have fragments of Lakelandic Saami which were preserved in Finnish place-names and dialectal vocabulary, the features of Paleo-Lakelandic substrate in Lakeland Saami cannot be studied. Many place-names in Finland come from Saami words of unknown origin which are likely substrate words, such as "jokuu"- from Proto Saami *čuokōs ‘track, way’.
The Saami substrate in Finnish dialects also reveals that Lakeland Saamic languages had a high number of words that have an obscure origin, which come from old languages of the region.
In terms of ancient population genetics, people preceding the speakers of Sami languages correlate with the spread of Y-DNA haplogroup I1 and mtDNA haplogroups H1 and U5b1b. However, it is possible that the presence of Y-DNA haplogroup I1a* (a subclade of I1), among the Sami, can be explained by migration during the last seven centuries.

Cave of the Angel

The Cave of the Angel refers to several cave-related structures located in the Aras mountain range near the town of Lucena, Córdoba province in Spain. The site contains lithic material of an Acheulean typology and dates to that from the Middle Pleistocene to the Upper Pleistocene. There is geological, paleontological, and archaeological evidence indicating an intense and long-term occupation of this site. The numerous bone and lithic remains found in this site, as well as the matrix surrounding them, reveal exposure to fire. This, along with the finding of a wide and deep combustion structure in the stratigraphic profile, support the hypothesis that at the time of the occupation of the site by humans there was processing and consumption of big mammals.
Location.
The Cave of the Angel is a Middle and Upper Pleistocene site located near the town of Lucena in the province of Córdoba, in Andalusia, Spain. Specifically, this site is in the SW skirt of the Aras mountain range, with an altitude of 620 m.a.s.l and coordinates of .
Background.
In 1995, and as a consequence of the plundering performed in the area, the first archaeological intervention took place as a matter of urgency under the direction of Cecilio Barroso Ruíz. The purposes of this first intervention were to determine the extension of the site, assess its archaeological interest, carry out a scientific study and develop a plan for its preservation. The results of this intervention revealed the existence of speleothems which indicated the presence of a cave. Additionally, they found a trench that was the result of mining activities carried out during the XVIII century looking for travertine. There is a text written by Ramirez de Luque in 1792 titled “Lucena Desagraviada” (in English “Lucena Redress”) attesting the mining activity in the Aras mountain range where the miners found very well preserved petrified remains of bones embedded in the rock.
In 1996, the archaeologists kept clearing the site, establishing a pit, over 2 meters wide, filled with limestone blocks. However, in spite of all of these findings, the team did not receive a research permit until 2004, the year in which Spanish and French research institutions started to collaborate in the site.
In 2012, Cecilio Barroso founded the “Fundación Instituto de Investigación y Evolución Humana” (in English, “Foundation for Research into Prehistory and Human Evolution”), a non-profit entity whose purpose is to publicize and to promote research projects concerning the prehistory of Southern Iberian Peninsula.
Geology.
The cave is composed of dolomite and limestone creating a karstic complex which dates back to the Mesozoic era, specifically during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, giving rise to three different areas.
The first one is an out-door platform which was the only one excavated until 2011. Here, there are blocks of breccia, limestone and speleothems. The occurrence of this last formation denotes the presence of a rocky shelter that collapsed at an unknown moment in the past (most likely during the Upper Pleistocene) occurring the structure we can appreciate nowadays.
The second area is a cave placed a few meters away from the former one in NE direction. This cave is filled with collapsed blocks. This structure seems to be the last remain of original cave.
The third structure is a 100 m depth chasm located under the previous cave, both communicated by two small hollows. In this chasm, there is a 70 m height cone of debris composed by blocks of rock, sand, clasts, animal bones and lithic artifacts. In 2009, a tunnel was dug to facilitate access to researches as well as to the public.
It is relevant to mention the occurrence of a wide structure of combustion whose maximum depth reached over 1.5 m and it does not show features of individual hearths. This suggests a long-term occupation of the site by human groups.
Fauna.
Herpetofauna.
The amphibian remain findings belong to the genre of "Discoglossus", "Alytidae" and "Bufo" although the determination to the level of species could be done only for the last one. These species are "B. bufo" and "B. calamites".
The reptiles are represented by "Chalcides", "Timon" ("T. lepidus"), "Podarcis", "Blanus" ("B. cinereus"), "Coronella", "Malpolon" ("M. monspessulanus"), "Hemorrhois" ("H. hippocrepis") and "Testudo" ("T. hermanni").
The presence of some of these taxa is particularly relevant, since they are bioindicators, allowing to take a first approach of the paleoclimatic context of the site. In concrete, "T. hermanni", "T. lepidus", "B. cinereus", "M. monspessulanus" and "H. hippocrepis" inhabit environments of Mediterranean climate.
Mammals.
Numerous mammal bone remains appear very fragmented and a big proportion of them also shows clear evidences of exposure to fire (about 88% of the total amount).
Most of these bone remains belong to ("Equus ferus") followed in quantity by bovines. Also, remains belonging to other species are present, among which the most relevant are "Cervus elaphus" and "Dama dama" and, in a lesser amount "Sus scrofa", "Stephanorhinus hemitoechus", "Palaeloxodon antiquus", "Ursus arctos", "Lynx pardinus", "Oryctolagus cuniculus" and "Capra pyrenaica".
Equine bones are mainly adult skull bones and long bone diaphysis form front and rear legs. They display defleshing and disarticulation cutting marks. Bovine remains are mainly adult dental pieces and long bones also showing defleshing and disarticulation cutting marks. Due to the high level of fragmentation in bovine bones, it is difficult to identify if they correspond to bison ("Bison priscus") or aurochs ("Bos primigenius"). Numerous "S. scrofa" remains have also been found although in a notably less proportion of the total amount. It is also relevant the systematic fracturing of bones to extract morrow.
Concerning the rest of species, there are much less material, although there are pieces of significance such as one tusk and a metapod from elephant ("Palaeloxodon antiquus"), dental pieces and metapod of rhinoceros ("Stephanorhinus hemitoechus") and a molar of a goat ("Capra pyrenaica").
It is remarkable the almost complete absence of carnivores, which are only represented by a few bones of "Ursus arctos", "Lynx pardinus" and "Canis lupus". The occurrence of carnivores in other sites, as in Boquete de Zafarraya, alternates with human presence in the stratigraphy. This event is interpreted as a seasonal occupation of the site by humans. When humans leave this habitat, carnivores take place of the site. Since this situation is not observed at Cave of the Angel, and moreover, there is no interruption in the stratigraphy of human presence, it is likely that a long term human occupation took place. In contrast, the existence of those few carnivore remains can be explained as the result of human consumption as so it happens with rabbit remains ("Oryctolagus cuniculus").
As a conclusion, the fauna remains at the Cave of the Angel can be classified in two main groups: first, the most numerous in terms of number of remains, corresponds to big herbivores characteristic of open plains (horse, rhinoceros, elephant, aurochs and bison) and a second group, less numerous, of dwellers of forestall environment (deer, fallow deer and boar).
Lithic industry.
Lithic industry corresponds to Acheulean with no presence of Levallois technique. Although chronologically the site matches the Mousterian period in other sites of Spain and Europe, the site is Acheulean without exhibition of any significant change in the typology of the lithic industry all along the stratigraphic sequence.
Flint is the main material used to produce stone tools (&gt;99%) and very rarely quartzite and calcite. More than 5,000 pieces have hitherto been studied, among which more than one half are classified as flake and blades and more than 800 of the total display retouched, from which 70% are scrapers. Also 50 handaxes have been found, along with burins, small scrapers, cores and occasionally points and awls. Debris add up to about a quarter of all the analyzed pieces. It is important to mention that over a third of these pieces show evidence of being exposed to a source of high temperature.
The lithic industry corresponds to the Late Acheulean, which places the Cave of the Angel in the Middle Pleistocene, but the chronology of the site reaches the Mousterian, which is a feature of the Upper Pleistocene. Therefore the researchers propose three hypotheses to explain this situation:
The first hypothesis postulates that the Cave of the Angel shows a transitional situation from a Late Acheulean lithic industry towards a fully developed Mousterian one.
The second hypothesis points out that the Acheulean group who inhabited the site may have undergone a process of acculturation to acquire the Mousterian industry.
The third one considers a scenario of convergence where the fully developed Acheulean cultures from the Cave of the Angel independently develop a Mousterian lithic industry without contact or influence from other existing Mousterian groups who dwelt in the Iberian Peninsula and Europe.
In Western Europe, there are several Middle Pleistocene and Upper Pleistocene sites that, as at the Cave of the Angel, show their own features in the typology of their industries. For instance, Cueva de Bolomor does not present either handaxes or Levallois. Similarly, the site of Ambrona lacks handaxes but does contain examples of the Levallois technique. These examples, along with the Cave of the Angel, reinforce the idea that the limit between Middle Pleistocene and Upper Pleistocene is a blur.
Dating.
In order to determine the age of this site, a series of U/Th dating were carried out on geological and archaeological samples obtained in 1995 excavation season from the upper most and lowest levels of the stratigraphic sequence. The archaeological results provide the age of 121 +11/-10 kya for the upper most level and &gt;369 kya for the lowest one. Alternatively, the geology provides about 400 kya for the oldest sample. These dates place the Cave of the Angel site in the Middle and Upper Pleistocene periods.
The intervention carried out in the excavation season of 2016, unearthed a stratigraphic profile presenting stone artifacts and fauna remains suggesting an age of 500,000 years old.
Human remains.
In 2012, the first hominid remain was found in the chasm. It is a femur diaphysis that, due to the Acheulean industry associated with it and the degree of fossilization, can be assigned to pre-neanderthals.
The following year, the cone of debris located in the chasm was excavated for the first time. The total area excavated was 6 m2 reaching a depth of 1 m. By the end of the season, more than 800 "Homo sapiens" remains were found, belonging to 50 infants, juveniles and adults. These remains date back to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods displaying clear differences in between the two periods. The Neolithic bones exhibit exposure to fire and cutting marks, whereas the Chalcolithic remains lack either of these two features. Additionally, the distribution of both groups along with the specific pattern of fractures they present, indicate that the corpses were not deposited, but thrown. Hence, the most likely places through which they were thrown are the hollows that connect the upper cave and the chasm itself.

HMS Torrid (1917)

HMS "Torrid" was an destroyer which served with the Royal Navy during World War I. Subsequently, "Torrid" was used in the 1930s as a trials ship for new anti-submarine warfare weapons, particularly playing a role in the development of ASDIC. The vessel was launched on 10 February 1917 and wrecked off the Falmouth coast en route to being broken up on 16 March 1937.
Design.
"Torrid" was one of ten destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in March 1916 as part of the Eighth War Construction Programme. The ship was laid down by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson at Wallsend on the River Tyne and launched in February 1917.
"Torrid" was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Power was provided by three Yarrow boilers feeding two Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines rated at and driving two shafts, to give a design speed of . Three funnels were fitted. of oil were carried, giving a design range of at .
Armament consisted of three Mk IV QF guns on the ship's centreline, with one on the forecastle, one aft on a raised platform and one between the second and third funnels. A single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom anti-aircraft gun was carried, while torpedo armament consisted of two twin mounts for torpedoes. Fire control included a single Dumaresq and a Vickers range clock. The ship had a complement of 82 officers and men.
Service.
On commissioning, "Torrid" joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla of the Harwich Force. "Torrid" remained part of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at the end of the war, but was reduced to the Crew on 20 October 1919.
During the 1930s, "Torrid" was used as a trial ship for new anti-submarine weapons. The ship was equipped with ASDIC in 1930, and successfully demonstrated that the system worked. "Torrid" subsequently used ASDIC to successfully find the sunken aircraft-carrying submarine on 3 February 1932. ASDIC went on to prove invaluable in the Battle of the Atlantic. The vessel was also used to trial a forward-firing anti-submarine mortar with less success. During this time, between 18 December 1930 and 10 July 1931, the destroyer was commanded by Charles Pizey, later the first Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy.
"Torrid" was considered as part of the planned Royal Navy deployment in defence of traffic between Port Said and Alexandria on 19 October 1935 after the start of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War but was retired before the outbreak of hostilities between Italy and the British Empire. The destroyer was handed over to Thos W Ward of Sheffield in 27 January 1937 in exchange for RMS "Majestic". However, while being towed to the breakers on 16 March 1937, the ship ran aground onto rocks at Trefusis, Falmouth. The wreck was broken up and scrapped "in situ", but remains of interest to divers.
The ship's plaque, bearing the motto, is held by the Imperial War Museum.

Defence Act 1990

The Defence Act 1990 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand which establishes the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) and defines the respective roles of, and relationships between, the minister of defence, the chief of defence force and the secretary of defence.
Background.
Under previous legislation, the three services—New Zealand Army, Royal New Zealand Navy and Royal New Zealand Air Force—were part of the Ministry of Defence. Post-1990, the Ministry of Defence is a separate, policy-making body under a secretary of defence; the chief of defence force and secretary of defence have both separate and shared responsibilities.
Provisions.
Part 1: Constitution of armed forces.
The Act constitutes the armed forces "in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign" and grants the governor-general the power of the raise armed forces. The governor-general is, under the Letters Patent 1983, commander-in-chief of New Zealand. The Defence Act greatly restricts the powers of the commander-in-chief, unlike the US president as commander-in-chief for example.
The Act then states that the Minister of Defence: "...shall have the power of control of the New Zealand Defence Force, which shall be exercised through the Chief of Defence Force."
Part 2: The New Zealand Defence Force.
The Act defines the different services of New Zealand Defence Forces:
And various reserve and territorial services.
Part 3: Secretary of Defence, Chief of Defence Force, and Chiefs of Service.
The Act defines the Secretary of Defence as the chief executive of the Ministry of Defence, the Chief of Defence Force as "principal military adviser to the Minister and other Ministers" and the other chiefs of the services of the defence force.
Part 4: Terms and conditions of service.
Section 34 of the Act defines the Armed forces oath.

John Tudor Jones

John Tudor Jones, OBE, also known as John Eilian (29 December 1903 - 9 March 1985) was a Welsh journalist, poet (chaired and crowned at the National Eisteddfod of Wales), literary scholar, broadcaster, and translator into Welsh of many classical songs and children's books.
He dedicated his working life to the Welsh language, literature, culture and history. He believed, among other things, that 'the Welsh language is the most British thing in Britain, spoken from the Firth of Clyde (Clwyd), through Cumbria (Cymru) to Dover (dwfr), before the English came in, and taken over the Channel to Brittany by emigrants’ and that Welshness would survive better, as it had done for centuries, within the structure of Britain, rather than by imposing on itself an English-style 'home rule’ based on a culturally and historically arbitrary boundary. He played a major part in championing the concept of Gwynedd 'as part of the national unity of Britain’.
Early life.
John Eilian was born in Marsden, Tyne and Wear and raised by his grandmother in the parish of Llaneilian in Anglesey on the 29th of December 1903. He was registered as John Thomas Jones but, in the 1930s, changed his middle name by deed poll to ‘Tudor’. He was
christened in Llaneilian church in 1914, and it was then that he began
to play the organ, and music (as well as the Church in Wales) became
an important part of his life. His primary school was Penysarn Council School. His secondary school
was the County School in Llangefni, where he learnt English; he often
spoke about the gratitude he owed to the headmaster, Samuel James
Evans, who developed his thorough bi-lingualism.
He spent one year at Aberystwyth University where he learnt his bardic craft from T Gwynn Jones and T H Parry-Williams. He then went to Jesus College, Oxford: almost certainly due to lack of financial support - he and his sister were brought up by a single mother, who, at the same
time, cared for her older disabled brother - he did not complete his
studies there either, leaving during his first year. As a 19-year-old in 1923, he published (with E Prosser Rhys) a somewhat controversial and risque but well-received book
of poems entitled ‘Gwaed Ifanc’. In September 1924, having established himself as a radical thinker, he was invited by the Honorary Secretary
1
of the Llangefni Labour Party to have his name put forward as the
Parliamentary Candidate for the Anglesey constituency. His career as a journalist began at the Western Mail in 1924.
Journalism in the middle east.
In 1927, John Eilian took up a post as Editor of the Times of Mesopotamia, and was married in Basrah on 4 October 1927 to Lilian Maud Powell, a Welsh scholar. From 1927 to 1929 he was the Iraq Correspondent of the London Times. He also published regularly in the Daily Mail. During this spell, he had some interesting
experiences in the Arabian Desert at the time when King Ibn Saud's
followers were raiding the borders of Iraq and threatening Holy War. After returning from Mesopotamia, he joined
the Daily Mail in Fleet Street.
Y Ford Gron (1930-1935).
The idea of establishing ‘Y Ford Gron’ was inspired by a conversation
with the Sir David Hughes-Parry, lawyer and son-in-law of Sir Owen M Edwards, who was somewhat disheartened by the state of Welsh periodicals.
John Eilian and his wife decided to address this by launching their own
journal - modern in style, wide in its appeal - and seeing what happened.
To this end, they rented a small room, next door to the Daily Mail HQ, in Fetter Lane.
They realised that, to succeed, things had to be run professionally. They decided that Hughes a’i Fab in Wrexham was the only publishing
company with the equipment and experience to meet the task; also,
Rowland Thomas, the owner, had great ambitions. Then they wrote many
letters to friends and contacts all over Wales with a view to
generating interest.
The material was produced in London and sent to Wrexham for publication.
The first ‘Y Ford Gron’ - Papur Cymru’r Byd (‘The Round Table’ - a
Paper for the Welshmen of the World) appeared in November 1930, at 6d
(old pence) per copy.
With a circulation of 13000, Hughes a’i Fab were delighted but the
workload was unsustainable. Rowland Thomas saw his opportunity,
bought ‘Y Ford Gron’, and appointed John Eilian editor, and also
publisher for Hughes a’i Fab. It was at this time that he was joined
by the journalist, Percy Ogwen Jones.
‘Y Ford Gron’ continued monthly for 5 years until October 1935 - the
‘golden years of the history of the Welsh press’, according to
Professor Bedwyr Lewis Jones. Many leading
figures of the day wrote to John Eilian during this period and their
letters are in his archive at the National Library of Wales.
"Y Cymro".
In 1932, John Eilian became the founding editor of "Y Cymro", the first-ever newspaper in Welsh for the whole of Wales. However, the paper did not really match the success of "Y Ford Gron" and Rowland Thomas decided to rationalise the situation by dropping the latter. This caused a rift and in 1935 John Eilian resigned from Hughes a’i Fab. "Y Cymro" was a significant part of John Eilian's legacy to Welsh culture (another ‘miracle’ in the view of John Roberts Williams) and it continued until 2017.
The Ceylon period (1935-1937).
In 1935, Jones went abroad once again, this time to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) where he was the Editor of "The Times of Ceylon". His interest in broadcasting may have stemmed from his involvement in establishing Ceylon's first commercial radio station.
On 26 October 1936 the BBC Regional Programme (West) broadcast a one-act play in Welsh under the title "Y Darn Arian"– a translation by Jones of "The Silver Coin" by Arthur O. Roberts – and on 6 June 1937 Jones gave a talk in Welsh – "Alltud o Gymro yn Ceylon" ("A Welsh exile in Ceylon") about his life in Colombo – in the Regional Programme (West and Wales).
During this period, Jones maintained his involvement in Welsh cultural life and journalism. In June–July 1937 he published four linked articles in "Y Cymro" on prominent Welshmen: T. Gwynn Jones, W. J. Gruffydd, R. Williams Parry, and Saunders Lewis. Here we begin to see Jones developing a view of Welsh culture and history as an integral and important part of the history of Britain as a whole, and not something about which Welsh people should get nationalistic. (Later, he would be described in "The South Wales Voice" as "not a Welsh Nationalist but [...] no less a Welsh patriot".) Before returning to Britain, John Eilian spent short periods with "The Macedonian Times" and "The Iraq Times".
Broadcasting and journalism from 1938.
In 1938, John Eilian was appointed BBC Welsh Programme
Director, a post he held for 18 months until the outbreak of war.
One notable achievement of this period was that he persuaded
his London colleagues to broadcast for the first time the famous
song, ‘We’ll keep a welcome in the hillsides’ - on 24 September
1940. Then, in April 1940, John Eilian was appointed Chief Editor of
the BBC Monitoring Service:
This is the new organisation which keeps a constant watch on the propaganda and news broadcast by enemy and neutral countries and prepares a comprehensive daily summary for official use. Started when the war began, the monitoring service now has a staff of over 200 dealing with broadcasts in more than 20 languages.
During the war period, John Eilian contributed regularly to
‘Y Cymro’ under the nom-de-plume of Robin Bwrgwyn (Robin of
Burgundy): the articles challenged the anti-British position
championed by Saunders Lewis in ‘Y Faner’. He continued at the BBC until 1948 when he returned to Wales.
In 1951, John Eilian published a long article in ‘ Y Llenor’
entitled ‘Y BBC a Chenedl y Cymru’ (The BBC and the Welsh Nation). In it, after 11 years at the BBC, he reflects on its state as an
institution and discusses the opportunities possible for developing
‘quality’ broadcasting in Welsh, as well as the dangers of
settling for mediocracy.
From 1953 to 1981, he was managing editor of Caernarvon Herald
group of weekly newspapers. During this period, John Eilian was
also a prolific contributor to both radio and TV programmes. In
particular, from 8 Jan 1960 until 27 May 1960 John Eilian chaired
a series of 20 current affairs discussion programmes called ‘Pawb
a’i Farn’ on TWW (Television, Wales and West). Later that year, the
BBC ran a series of four programmes on famous politicians
(Fidel Castro, David Ben-Gurion, Konrad Adenaur ...
broadcast throughout the UK) called ’Y Byd yn eu Dwylo’ (English: The World in their Hands); these were discussions by distinguished panels,
chaired by John Eilian.
In January 1961 the BBC produced a television version of "Y Darn Arian", Jones's translation of the play first broadcast on radio in 1936.
Poetry.
Apart from ’Gwaed Ifanc’, John Eilian had many poetic works
published in newspapers, books and journals (particularly
‘Y LLenor’), over the decades. The highlight of his poetic career was becoming one of a few
poets to win both chair (1947) and crown (1949) at the National
Eisteddfod of Wales. The latter, ‘Meirionnydd’ has been described
on a BBC website as one of the best chair-winning poems of the
National Eisteddfod, and excerpts from it are included in the
Oxford Book of Welsh Verse.
Literary scholarship.
In 1931, John Eilian produced a highly acclaimed series of booklets called,
‘LLyfrau’r Ford Gron’, on the ‘greats’ of Welsh literature
and poetry. Also, throughout his career, he published widely in journals on a variety of topics.
Translation.
John Eilian translated (or composed) over 80 songs that were
published by W S Gwynn Williams, ranging from classical works such
as Handel's ‘Judas Maccabaeus’ to folk songs such as
‘Hey ho, to the greenwood’ by William Byrd. He also translated many children's books into Welsh.
Politics.
Despite having been a strong Labour supporter in his youth, John Eilian ended up standing as a Conservative candidate for the Ynys Mon
(Anglesey) constituency in the 1964, 1966 and 1970 General Elections.
He was very much on the Macmillanite (left) side of the Party and
anti-Thatcher. He was a Unionist, believing that Wales, its
language and culture, would fare better within the United Kingdom
- where, as he saw it, it belonged and had thrived historically - rather
than by adopting ‘home rule’, and mimicking an English style of
politics.
Honours.
In 1964 John Eilian was awarded an OBE for ‘services to journalism’
and, in 1974, he was elected a member of the Royal Commission on the Press,–
representing provincial papers. In 2004, a commemorative plaque was
erected on his Anglesey childhood home, Penlan, Pen y Sarn.

Anne Lester Hudson

Anne Lester Hudson is an American mathematician and mathematics educator. Her research specialty is the theory of topological semigroups; she is also known for her skill at mathematical problem-solving, and has coached students to success in both the International Mathematical Olympiad and the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. She is a professor emeritus at the Georgia Southern University-Armstrong Campus (formerly Armstrong State College).
Education.
Born as Anne Lester, Hudson is originally from Mississippi,
and grew up in Inverness, Mississippi, a town so small that there were only seven students in her high school class.
She did her undergraduate studies at Hollins College, with Herta Freitag as a mentor. Unusually for the time, she continued at Hollins for four years, instead of transferring after two years to another university, in order to continue working with Freitag.
She graduated in 1953.
In 1961, she earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from Tulane University,
where she also met her husband, mathematician Sigmund Hudson. Her dissertation, "On the Structure of Certain Classes of Topological Semigroups", was supervised by Paul Stallings Mostert. She became the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at Tulane.
Career.
After postdoctoral studies funded by the National Science Foundation and NATO,
Hudson became a faculty member at Syracuse University, and earned tenure there in 1966 for her research. In 1971 she moved to Armstrong State College in Georgia, "to an environment more heavily involved in undergraduate teaching".
In 1994 Hudson directed the United States Math Olympiad Program, a training program for the U.S. team in the International Mathematical Olympiad. She went to Hong Kong, where the Olympiad was held, as the coach for the team, and led the team to win the Olympiad.
Recognition.
In 1993, when the Mathematical Association of America began giving out its Deborah and Franklin Haimo Awards for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics, Hudson was one of the first winners. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching named her as one of their 1996 Outstanding Professors of the Year. She was given a special commendation by the Georgia House of Representatives in 1997. Hollins College has also given her their outstanding alumna award.

Sail Croatia

Sail Croatia is a British cruise line operating in the Adriatic Sea along the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. It promotes an ecological initiative called Green Sail.
In 2013, the line had four chartered motorised cruising vessels. Along with sailing, the offer included kayaking and rafting on the mainland and buggy safaris on the islands, as well as cycling on week-long trips in its "sail &amp; cycle" holidays. Aside from leisurely cruises, the line introduced party boats for the 21-35 age group in 2017. The motor yachts, which take up to 40 passengers, are based at Split Marina.
Green Sail initiative.
The Green Sail initiative educates cruise lines, sailors, and tourists about the importance of sorting and recycling waste on the Adriatic. By mid-2017, it had managed to gather 500 charter lines and partner marinas. Each vessel in the Green Sail network contains free packages for guests with information on Dalmatian marinas with recycling facilities.

1974 Leningrad Aeroflot Il-18 crash

On 27 April 1974, an Aeroflot Il-18 airliner crashed while operating a charter flight from Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) to Zaporizhzhia, continuing to Krasnodar, Russia. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Pulkovo Airport in Leningrad. None of the 109 people on board survived.
Aircraft.
The aircraft had been in service since 1964, and had sustained 7,501 cycles (takeoffs and landings) at the time of the crash.
Passengers and crew.
The flight was led by Captain Nikolai Danilov, with 4 other pilots and two flight attendants. There were 102 passengers on board.
Accident.
The aircraft's number four engine caught fire two minutes after takeoff due to a faulty compressor disk. The crew elected to return to the airport. Upon extending the flaps for landing, an asymmetrical flap condition occurred, causing the aircraft to dive sharply about two and a half kilometers from the runway.
Strong vibrations in the number four engine had been reported on the flight before the crash.

Induced seismicity in Canada

With the development of both conventional and unconventional resources in Canada, induced seismicity caused by anthropological activities has been observed, documented, and studied.
Induced events are generally smaller in magnitude than the most ‘important’ earthquakes documented by Natural Resources Canada. The largest natural earthquakes are generally located in the coastal regions of the country. The majority of large, natural seismic events in Western Canada are located near the Cascadia and Juan de Fuca Subduction Zones. The majority of large, natural seismic events in Eastern Canada are localized to distinct seismic zones like the Charlevoix-Kamouraska region. The only ‘important’ interior earthquakes, as classified by Natural Resources Canada, are the two strike-slip fault failures of local magnitude (ML) 6.6 and 6.9 observed in the Nahanni region of the Northwest Territories. Induced earthquakes, however, tend to occur in a 150-km-wide band east of the Canadian Rocky Mountains where the tectonic strain rate is relatively high.
Induced seismicity in Canada is mainly related to hydraulic fracturing and wastewater disposal. Within the central Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), evidence shows that geological factors likely influence the nature of induced seismicity related to hydraulic fracturing operations, as they share two characterizations in terms of spatial distributions:
1.    Pre-existing basement-controlled faults are more likely to be triggered based on the focal depth analysis of earthquake clusters;
2.    The lateral distributions of earthquake clusters are significantly correlated with the margins of the fossil reef structures in the Swan Hills Formation.
These phenomena can be explained by the regional- and local-scale geological evolution of this area. First, basement tectonics play a role in reef growth which were nucleated on elevated structures during the Devonian period. Second, the generation of dolomitized strata requires deep-seated faults to transport Mg-enriched fluid, which can later provide transport conduits for injected fluids, thereby creating hydraulic connections with the reservoir. Dolomitization of Devonian strata increased the formation permeability and generated greater fluid diffusivity, thus more induced seismicity occurred.
A total of 216 induced earthquakes occurred between 2009 and 2011 at the Etsho and Kiwigana fields in Horn River, Canada. Of those, 19 were between magnitudes (ML) 2 and 3, and the largest felt event reached ML 3.8. Seismicity was temporally correlated to pumping fluids during hydraulic fracture treatments, with earthquakes starting several hours after the onset of pumping. Since at least 2009, the Horn River Basin has been the site of induced seismicity associated with oil and gas activities. The BC Oil and Gas Commission states that over 8,000 hydraulic fracturing completions have had no associated anomalous seismicity in this region between 2009 and 2011.
Studies on induced seismicity have been ongoing since the 1970s. Focus on the cause of induced seismicity has shifted from activities related to conventional resources like mining to unconventional resource exploration and production. Barriers to understanding induced seismicity processes include lack of access to subsurface hydrogeological and geomechanical data, insufficient stress state data, and limited records of seismicity at the nucleation process scale.
Mechanism.
The mechanism of induced seismicity can be categorized based on different causes. It is widely accepted that impoundment of reservoirs, mining, oil and gas exploration and production, including injecting fluids to the subsurface and extracting oil and gas from the underground, are related to induced seismic events.
Industrial operations that create tremor movement of the ground, such as mining and seismic data collecting, are often a cause of induced seismicity. In the vicinity of deep mining activities, seismicities are often related to rockbursts - the violent failure of rock due to excavation. The magnitudes of these seismic events, however, are dependent on the local geological settings, such as the rock properties, faulting system, and regional stresses. For geophysical exploration activities, usually seismic waves are generated by man-made explosions to help the geophysicists understand the underground formations and structures. These explosions are far away from the population-dense areas.
Induced seismicity related to fluid injection is generally triggered by two basic mechanisms (Fig. 2): pore pressure perturbation via direct hydrologic connections and/or a change in total stress on pre-existing fault through poroelastic transmissions. A fault will be activated once the shear stress on the fault plane formula_1reaches a critical value formula_2:
formula_3
where formula_4is the cohesive strength, formula_5 is the normal stress on the fault plane, formula_6 is the pore pressure and formula_7 is the coefficient of friction. This can also be explained by Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion.
If the fault is hydraulically connected to the permeable reservoir, fluid pressure formula_8 will increase due to fluid injection leading to a decrease in the effective normal stress: formula_9; thus, the critical shear stress formula_2will be reduced, resulting in less frictional resistance to shear slip.
For remote faults without direct hydrologic connection to the permeable reservoir, they can be triggered by total stress changes as a result of poro-thermoelastic effects. Based on the mass balance principal, the volume of the reservoir should be enlarged after injection, which can alter the stress field outside of the reservoir. By changing the total stress (e.g., increasing formula_11 and/or reducing formula_12), faults, especially for near-critically stressed or optimally oriented faults, can be reactivated.
History of induced seismicity in Canada.
Induced seismicity has been documented in Canada since 1970. Many publications differentiate these events from natural earthquakes and attribute them to specific industrial activities using the Davis and Frohlich criteria. In Canada, induced seismic events have been attributed to fluid extraction, fluid injection and wastewater disposal, mining, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir impoundment. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is considered to be a risk factor for induced seismicity, but no minor seismic events or larger (defined with a moment magnitude [MW] of 2.0 or above) have been observed to date.
Fluid extraction.
Several cases of induced seismicity attributed to fluid extraction have been documented in Western Canada. An earthquake swarm with two events exceeding Mw 4 was attributed to gas extraction in the Strachan field near Rocky Mountain House, Alberta in the 1970s. A series of earthquakes was also observed between 1984 and 1994 near Fort St. John, British Columbia and attributed to gas extraction and secondary recovery (the injection of fluid to maintain pressure during hydrocarbon recovery). Events were observed within Permian strata up to ML 4.3.
Fluid injection.
The first case documented of induced seismicity occurred on March 8, 1970 within the Snipe Lake oil field, northwest of Edmonton Alberta, resulting in a shallow ML 5.1 event. Secondary recovery or waste disposal were also attributed to the induced events (ML 2.0) documented in Cold Lake, Alberta by Nicolson and Wessen. A series of earthquakes that occurred between 1994 and 2012 in the Cordel Field in Alberta were attributed to wastewater injection. The series of earthquakes resulted in two ML 4.0 events on March 31, 1997 and July 2, 2001. The British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) documented several incidents of wastewater disposal induced seismicity in the Pintail and Graham areas of British Columbia. The Pintail events occurred between 2013 and 2015 and resulted in events up to ML 3.1. The Graham events occurred between 2003 and 2015 and result in events up to ML 4.0. Secondary oil recovery also triggered seismicity in Cambrian strata near Gobles, Ontario in the 1980s, with several events exceeding ML 3.0.
Mining.
Separating natural earthquakes from mining related seismicity is difficult since most mines are also located in seismically active regions of Canada and the routine blasting at the mines is registered in Canadian seismic catalogues. For example, the Western Canadian Composite Seismicity Catalogue documented 3,898 earthquakes above moment magnitude 2 that were attributed to blasting as of July 2017.
Induced seismicity up to body wave magnitude (Mb) 5.0 has been documented at Devonian Potash mines in Saskatchewan and at Cretaceous coal mines in northern Ontario. One such sequence of earthquakes occurred in a potash mine near Saskatoon between 1979 and 1980 and another sequence occurred between 2005 and 2015, culminating in a Mb 4.0 event near Yorkton, Saskatchewan in January 2015.
Seven incidents of mining induced seismicity were documented in Ontario Canada between 2006 and 2009, with magnitudes ranging from ML 2.4 to ML 4.1. Documents show that a large series of mining related events occurred at the Strathcona nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario, reaching ML 2.7 in 1988. Numerous seismic events with magnitudes up to Mb 4.1 from 2004 through 2009 in Ontario were also studied and believed to be related to nickel, gold, and copper mines near Sudbury.
Hydraulic fracturing.
Induced seismicity has recently been attributed to hydraulic fracturing in Western Canada. A local magnitude 4.3 was attributed to hydraulic fracturing operations near Fox Creek, Alberta on June 13, 2015. The event represented the first 'red light' event under the Alberta Energy Regulator Subsurface Order 2 and resulted in a 16-day suspension of operations. This event corresponded to sequences of seismicity that were also linked to hydraulic fracturing near the 'red light' event before and after its occurrence.
Numerous induced events, up to Mw 3.8, were recorded near Fort Nelson, BC between April 2009 and December 2011. The events were attributed to hydraulic fracturing in Devonian strata. Another series of large seismic events up to Mw 4.2 occurred in Triassic strata near Fort St. John between 2013 and 2014. Another large event (Mw 4.6) occurred near Fort St. John on August 15, 2015.
Another type of hydraulic fracturing is the Weyburn carbon capture and storage (CCS), yet microseismic monitoring and analysis indicated that the likelihood of a felt event was low, with low rates of seismicity and observed events with Mw under 0.
Reservoir impoundment.
Induced seismicity has also been identified as a result of reservoir impoundment. The first documented event swarm, culminating in an Mb 4.1 event on October 23, 1975, was documented at the Manicouagan 3 reservoir in Quebec. Another induced event, ML 4.1, occurred near Mica, British Columbia on January 5, 1974 due to reservoir impoundment. An extensive swarm of earthquakes was observed during the filling of the LG3 dam in Quebec between 1981 and 1984, culminating in an Mb 3.0 event.
Distinguishing induced seismicity from natural seismicity.
The approach to discriminating induced seismicity from natural earthquakes is often based on source parameters, physics-based probabilistic models and statistics-based models. In terms of the source-parameter approach, natural earthquakes are expected to show more double-couple characteristics, where the volumetric change can be negligible. Region-specific attributes can also be an important factor to identify induced seismicity. In the Canadian Shield, for instance, induced events have significantly shallower depths than natural events. Induced seismic events often cluster near operations and occur over a short period of time, while natural earthquakes are more sporadic both in time and locations. Statistical analysis has also observed that clusters of seismicity related to injection are moving away from the injection wells over time.
Even though industrial activities can trigger seismic events, it is still intrinsically difficult to distinguish induced seismicity and natural earthquakes. Difficulties include the observed time lag and displacement between the injection and the detected seismic events, as well as the complexity of the geological setting. For instance, it took approximately 80 minutes from the onset of pumping and evidence for fault reactivation in gas wells in Western Canada, whereas some of the felt seismicity documented in the Horn River Basin occurred several hours after pumping started.
Regulations.
Protocols regarding induced seismicity were developed in respect of different causes, from hydraulic fracturing to geothermal related causes. The main purpose of these regulations is to prevent and minimize potential damage of induced seismicity. In Alberta, different subsurface orders are required. According to Section 11.104 of the Oil and Gas Conservation Rules, subsurface orders are issued. For example, Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) issued subsurface No.2 to Duvernay formation. In Fox Creek, the two thresholds are ML 2 and 4. If a seismic event had a magnitude larger than ML4, immediate shut-down is required. In Red Deer, because the operations are closer to residents, two thresholds are ML 1 and 3. In consideration of the dam integrity, subsurface No. 6 is published around the Brazeau Reservoir.The thresholds are ML 1 and 2.5. BC Oil and Gas Commission has a similar protocol, where operations have to stop if the monitored seismicity is larger than ML 4 within 3 km of the operation site. 
Besides the regulations enforced by the government, different operators have their own 'traffic light system' and specific mitigations to prevent inducing large earthquakes. Two surveys conducted by the Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysics(CSEG) show that some companies are being proactive with evaluating health, safety, environment, and public relations, and implementing on-site monitoring systems for induced seismicity. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) also publishes guidebooks based on industry practices to help the operators better manage the risk of induced seismicity.
Induced seismicity related to hydraulic fracturing.
In British Columbia.
The majority of induced seismicity in BC has been attributed to hydraulic fracturing. In northern British Columbia, 272 seismic events related to hydraulic fracturing, ranging between ML 1.0 and ML 3.8, were reported from April 2009 to December 2011. No injuries or property damage resulted from the earthquakes and only of one of these events was felt at the ground surface. The Government of BC is conducting a scientific panel aiming to answer inquiries about how regulations affect the industrial activities and how these regulations affect First Nations. More monitors have been installed by BC Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) for implementing a better monitoring system for induced seismicity. Aside from earthquakes, potential impacts like water and air pollution also pose concerns to the public.
In Alberta.
In Alberta, most of the largest earthquakes attributed to hydraulic fracturing have been observed in the Devonian strata of the Duvernay and Horn River Basin. A ML 4.44 event was triggered on August 4, 2014 in the Horn River Basin. A ML 4.36 was triggered on January 23, 2015 in the Kaybob Area of the Duvernay. Reef complexes control the geology of both formations and significant subvertical faults are present in both.
An energy company halted their operations as the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) was working on a review of fracking due to a registered Mw 4.8 earthquake reported about 35 km west of Fox Creek. No damage or injury had been reported from the earthquake but it was felt and caused noticeable ground shaking. A site survey was conducted by AER and operations were not restarted until mitigation plans were approved by the regulator.
Seismic monitoring and reporting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operators are implemented in the Fox Creek area for safe and environmental purposes by AER. Seismic events of a registered magnitude of 4.0 or greater are reported online by AER, as well as a real-time seismic event map. There are more than 40 seismic monitoring stations in Alberta.

Norma Meras Swenson

Norma Meras Swenson (born 1932) is an expert in the field of maternal and child health as well as in reproductive and sexual health rights. Swenson is a founding member of Our Bodies, Ourselves. She was a co-author and editor for many editions of "Our Bodies, Ourselves". 
Swenson has a Master of Public Health from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 1998, where she also taught from 2000 to 2017, specializing in Women, Heath, and Development. 
Due to a childhood set in a time where women's education was highly valued and sought after, Swenson formed what is a key part of her lifelong message and current belief: that education determines a person's place in life and, through education, we can help break down walls of inequality.
Our Bodies Ourselves.
In 1970, Swenson along with twelve other women began to create Our Bodies Ourselves. Receiving its inspiration from a women's liberation conference 1969, Our Bodies Ourselves, then known as the Boston Women's Health Book Collective took form as twelve women shared their stories surrounding the mistreatment they felt by doctors and the realization of their ignorance when it came to their bodies. Their mission was to offer women more cohesive and non-biased medical information. Ultimately, the OBOS founders shared their research findings in a 193-page booklet called "Women and Their Bodies." Their research and personal experiences became the first edition of "Our Bodies, Ourselves" in 1971. "We were furious about how many men wrote about women’s bodies or sexuality without knowing much, and we weren’t going to write unless we knew what we were talking about," Swenson said in a 2017 interview with "Aging Today."
Swenson also contributed on books such as "Ourselves, Growing Older" by utilizing her knowledge on topics such as sexuality, childbirth, menopause, housing, work, retirement, money, care giving, medical problems and death, all viewed from the perspective of the older woman in OBOS. The sharing of experiences is a predominant feature of "Ourselves, Growing Older" as it is in OBOS as well. In creating the book this way, Swenson and the other authors were able to create an environment that allowed women to find support through other women that are in the same predicament. Women took comfort in knowing that others share the problem.
Education.
A graduate of Tufts University, Swenson studied medical sociology while at Tufts, and then won a Danforth Foundation Fellowship to work with the critical sociologist Irving Zola at Brandeis University. Swenson earned an M.P.H (Master of Public Health) from the Harvard School of Public Health. After receiving her degree, Swenson taught for twenty years at the Harvard School of Public Health. She taught “Women, Health, and Development” from a global perspective in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Departments at HSPH. While at Harvard she served on the HSPH Alumni Council, and is a founding member and former faculty in the Concentration on Women, Gender, and Health. Swenson is also an Affiliate of the Women Gender &amp; Sexuality program at Harvard's Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences, and a member of the Group on Reproductive Health and Rights at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.
"She's Beautiful When She's Angry".
The film, "She's Beautiful When She's Angry" explains the history of the women who founded the modern women's movement from 1966 to 1971. The movie moves from the founding of NOW, with women in hats and gloves, to the beginning of more radical groups of women's liberation. "She's Beautiful When She's Angry" articulates the stories of 30 individual women and the "Our Bodies Ourselves" collective, all of which fought for their own equality and in the process created a revolution. Created by filmmaker Mary Dore, "She's Beautiful When She's Angry" is the first film about second-wave feminism to illustrate clearly the distinctions between what became the global women's health movement and how, as a movement, OBOS was somewhat closer to the heart of women's liberation than to mainstream feminism at the time. Rather than celebrating "girl power," Dore illustrates an honest, critical, and inclusive image of the history of second wave feminism. "It explains the place of “Our Bodies, Ourselves” in providing a feminist guide to women's health and medical care, while providing a bibliography for who was organizing and how to organize for both local and national change."
Swenson's mother was eight years old when women won the right to vote and electricity came to the immigrant farming community where she was born. By the time Swenson became a mother, she was president of a women’s rights organization. Thus, why Swenson feels, "one of the high points of “She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry” is the tribute paid and the link made to that first wave, which started with such a sweeping agenda and ended after not quite a century with the single, narrow goal of giving women the right to vote."

Ambush of Tinsalane

The ambush of Tinsalane occurred on February 11, 2012, when armed groups of Ansar Dine and the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) fought against a convoy of the Malian army who came to reinforce the troops besieged in Tessalit.
The ambush.
On February 10, 2012, the Malian army launched an offensive to rescue the garrison of Amachach camp, near Tessalit, besieged by the rebels. The army deployed on the ground 107 all-terrain vehicles, 6 BRDMs, as well as helicopters piloted by Ukrainian mercenaries. The ambush took place in Tinsalane, 20 kilometers south of Tessalit. 
According to Malian military sources, "The aim was to attract as many rebels as possible to the army, then to use combat helicopters to pound enemy positions (...) We chose to fight at Tessalit, because we could quickly transfer injured in Gao thanks to the airport that we control again since the weekend. " According to officers of the Malian army, more than 100 rebels have been killed, 50 taken prisoner and 70 vehicles destroyed. 
According to reports from sources close to the MNLA, on the morning of February 11, 2012, a convoy of Malian soldiers and militia departed the cities of Kidal and Anfif and moved towards Tessalit to strengthen the military forces of the besieged city. However, this convoy was ambushed by an MNLA brigade in Tinsalane. After several hours of fighting, the Malian forces fled, leaving 17 dead and 14 prisoners including commander Yousouf Ag Bougara. Six vehicles were destroyed and four captured. According to an MNLA spokesman, Hama Ag Sidahmed, the losses of the separatists were only 4 wounded. 
According to a resident of the city of Alkhalil, on the border with Algeria, the drivers of about 25 rebel vehicles were left wounded, and sought admission to Algerian hospitals. Fighting continued on 13 and 14 February, and the Malian army claimed it had managed to enter Tessalit, and refuel the Amachach camp, which the rebels denied.

FS Class E.432

FS Class E.432 was a class of three-phase electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways. Forty of these 1′D1′ locomotives were built in 1928 by Società Ernesto Breda and two have been preserved.
History.
Given the success obtained with the three-phase operation, the electrification continued and with it the demand for ever better performance. The previous E.431s proved to be disappointing, so that around 1926, the Traction Service of the State Railways set up a new locomotive project. Under the direction of Giuseppe Bianchi it was also decided to disengage from dependence on foreign patents for the pantographs, the connecting rods and transmission from the motors to the wheels. The new locomotives were ordered from Ernesto Breda in two batches totalling 40 units. The E.432 from 1929 went into service on the important Porrettana and Brennero lines and later on the lines between Turin and Genoa, towards the Val di Susa, and on the Ligurian coast lines, especially that of the west. They were pulling the most important and heaviest trains, fast, direct and international. They were often used in pairs and sometimes with other classes such as E.431 or E.333. On steeply-graded lines they might be used with small-wheel versions like the E.554. They were also used on local trains. 
With the direct current conversion of the most important lines, which occurred in the first half of the 1960s, they were concentrated in the locomotive depots of Savona and Cuneo, where they spent their last decade on more modest services at the head of trains along the Turin-Savona and Turin-Cuneo routes and related branches. E.432.008 hauled a special train from Alessandria to Acqui Terme on 25 May 1976 to mark the end of three-phase traction which, since the beginning of the first experiments, had lasted more than three quarters of a century.
Technical features.
Mechanical part.
The E.432 locomotive had a 1′D1′ wheel arrangement and the driving wheels were of 1.63 metre diameter. The carrying wheels were of 1.11 metre diameter and were mounted on Italian-style trollies to better negotiate curves. The locomotive was designed for fast and heavy passenger services.
The driving wheels were coupled by coupling rods and received the motion from the two traction motors by means of a special articulated connecting rod designed by Bianchi. There were sliding bearings to ease the negotiation of curves. The frame-mounted traction motors were dismountable from above for maintenance. The wheels were of the type used on steam locomotives with balance weights and cranks at 90 degrees.
Above the frame was a central cab and a short bonnet at each end. One bonnet housed the liquid rheostat with its pump and evaporative cooling device.
Electrical part.
The electrical part consisted of two three-phase AC motors of imposing size, just under two metres in diameter and twenty tonnes in weight. Each of them was equipped with a fan for forced air cooling. The circuit allowed cascade connection for starting and parallel connection for running at high speed. In addition, there were three different armature connections for 12, 8 or 6 pole running. This gave combinations for four speeds: 37.5, 50, 75 and 100 km/h. The switches for pole-changing were in boxes located above the motors. A liquid rheostat (containing sodium carbonate solution) was provided to limit the current during start-up and pole-changing. The necessary connections were established using a drum controller.
The cascade connection, little used, was eliminated around 1940. It was found more practical to start the locomotive at the second speed, by using the rheostat, and making less use of high voltage switching which was always a source of problems. Moreover, the motors were inclined to overheat when using cascade connection. 
Current collection was by two double-sided pantographs mounted on the roof of the cab and always used together.
Multiple unit control.
The success of the "Ligurian" multiple control, already tried on Classes E.551, E.554, E.333 and E.431, led to the idea of adopting it as standard equipment on all three-phase locomotives, excluding only the oldest types. The conversion of four members of Class E.432 was planned, but was completed only on a single unit. 
The first units chosen were E.432.002 and 030. On these two machines, as on E.431.018 and 036, the additional installation of a high voltage coupling was planned, which would have allowed the second unit to run with pantographs lowered. However, the work was delayed pending the practical results of the two E.431s. 
In the meantime, union problems arose with railway staff who feared possible future job reductions. In the early 1960s, the elimination of three-phase traction on the Fréjus and Giovi lines was already on the horizon and FS decided to suspend the programme. Ultimately, the only E.432 locomotive equipped with the "Ligurian" multiple control was E.432.030. Number E.432.002 had entered the workshop but work on converting it was never completed.
Preservation.
Two locomotives are preserved.

Lotanna is a 2017 Nigerian drama film, directed by Toka McBaror. The film stars Chris Okagbue as the title character. The film had its worldwide release on April 8, 2017, at Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos, Nigeria. The original soundtrack for the film was done by Naeto C and Praiz, and was well received by film critics as a high-point in the film.
Reception.
Isaballa Akinseye for Vanguard, praised the soundtrack, photography and costume but felt the story, directing, acting, editing and special effects were below par. It got a 58% rating from Nollywood Reinvented, who gave a general consensus that "On a very plain level, "Lotanna" is a good movie but for what it could have been, it never truly achieves this". It was recommended as one of ten films to watch by "The Cable". Wilfred Okiche for 360nobs was impressed with the recreation of the 1970s in the film, but was unimpressed by the body language of "Lotanna" and "Zara", as well as the acting of the "big names", it concluded its review by describing the film experience as "completely forgettable".

Labor–Farm Party of Wisconsin

The Labor–Farm Party of Wisconsin (also Wisconsin Labor and Farm Party, or LFP) was an independent left-leaning political party in the state of Wisconsin. In 1984, William Osborne Hart, one of the party's founders, intended to run for President of the United States and failed due to a Wisconsin Supreme Court deliberation. This, as well as other factors, led to the party's dissolution.
History.
The party was active in Wisconsin politics during 1982–1987. The party was formed "in reaction to the resurgence of conservatism as a political force in the 1980s". Its platform demanded larger government intervention with regard to factory and farm operations, protecting farmers' and workers' welfare, and shared civil rights concepts with members of the "Rainbow Coalition" of feminists, the LGBT lobby, as well as included other notions.
Before the 1984 presidential election, the LFP wanted for William Hart, one of the party's founders, to run as a presidential candidate. This failed due to a Supreme Court of Wisconsin decision, and Hart subsequently resignation from the party.
The party concentrated its efforts in an attempt to defeat Les Aspin in 1986, then Wisconsin's 1st congressional district Representative. The Labor and Farm Party was generally not successful, a reason which led to its dissolution in 1987. However, Lucille Berrien ran for State Treasurer of Wisconsin in 1990 with the LFP, but lost to Cathy Zeuske. Several party members then went on to form the Progressive Party and the Wisconsin Green Party in the 1990s.
After Hart's resignation, Kathryn Christensen became its de facto head. Mary K. Baum ran for minor offices in 1986 on its ticket and for Governor as an independent.

QTS-11

The Type 11, () designated as QTS-11, is an air burst grenade launcher integrated with the QBZ-03 assault rifle in service of Chinese military since 2015. Reporting on the weapon as early as February 2011 initially identified the weapon as the ZH-05.
History.
Deployment.
In early 2018, Chinese state media announced the introduction of the weapon with the Sky Wolf Commando Unit, a branch of PLA Special Operations Forces from the Western Theater Command. The Sky Wolf Commando was publicly revealed recently on August 2, 2017.
Chinese marines use QTS-11 in anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.
Design.
The QTS-11 system combines the QBZ-03 assault rifle with a 20 mm airburst grenade launcher and weighs between 5 kg and 7 kg when fully loaded. This makes China the third country to develop an airburst infantry weapon, after the American XM29 Objective Individual Combat Weapon and XM25 CDTE, and the South Korean S&amp;T Daewoo K11. Unlike other nations' airburst weapons, the QTS-11 has a single-shot grenade launcher that requires each round to be manually loaded and reloaded after every firing, while the others are magazine fed. Initial PLA trials determined that a single-shot grenade launcher would make it easier to change the type of munitions fired. The PLA does not have multi-purpose munitions but instead has different munitions types, which reduce the electronics needed and increase the firepower of the munition. Additionally, only the laser range finder and fire control system are integrated with the weapon, leaving optics optional and modular. These changes make it the lightest, and least capable, of all the airburst weapons in its base configuration.
The primary weapon of the system is the 20 mm grenade launcher, with the 5.8 mm rifle for secondary use. Grenades are pre-programmed through electronic sight with fire control system and loaded manually through bolt-action. Five types of grenade rounds available: impact detonation, airburst, armor-piercing, improved fragmentation and shotgun-type rounds. The U.S. encountered problems with the lethality of small 20 mm grenades during OICW development, resulting in a switch to larger 25 mm grenades for the XM25. The PLA claims their grenades have less electronics in them to carry more explosives and fragments to cause adequate wounding capability. The grenades are reportedly capable of a damage radius and an range with 220 m/s muzzle velocity.
The QTS-11 can be equipped with an additional eyepiece device mounted on the helmet allowing soldiers to shoot around corners. The video image will be streaming from the electronic sight to the single-eye goggle. The fire-control system can also be turned off for manual sighting without the airburst programming capability.

ClickSeq

ClickSeq is a click-chemistry based method for generating next generation sequencing libraries for deep-sequencing platforms including Illumina, HiSeq, MiSeq and NextSeq. Its function is similar to most other techniques for generating RNAseq or DNAseq libraries in that it aims to generate random fragments of biological samples of RNA or DNA and append specific sequencing adaptors to either end of every fragment, as per the requirements of the particular sequencing platform to be used (e.g. HiSeq).
In ClickSeq, reverse transcription (RT) reactions are supplemented with small amounts of 3’-azido-nucleotides (AzNTPs) at defined ratios to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). AzNTPs are chain-terminators and therefore induce the stochastic termination of cDNA synthesis at an average length determined by the ratio of AzNTPs to dNTPs. This results in the production of single-stranded cDNA fragments that contain an azido-group at their 3' ends. These 3'-azido-blocked cDNA molecules are purified away from the components of the RT reaction, and subsequently 'click-ligated' to 5’ alkyne-modified DNA adaptors via copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). This generates ssDNA molecules with unnatural triazole-linked DNA backbones. Nevertheless, these templates are used in PCR reactions and amplified to generate a cDNA sequencing library with the appropriate 5' and 3' sequencing adapters and indices required for Next-Generation Sequencing. ClickSeq has predominantly been used to sequence viral RNA genomes such as Flock House virus, cricket paralysis virus, and Zika virus, due to its resilience to artifactual chimera formation.
Poly(A)-ClickSeq.
Poly(A)-ClickSeq is a variant of ClickSeq designed to target the junction of the three prime untranslated region (UTRs) and poly(A)-tails of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of higher-order organisms and of RNA viruses infecting these cells types. The core principle is similar to ClickSeq, however, the reverse-transcription step uses an oligo-dT primer (unanchored) to initiate cDNA synthesis from within the poly(A) tail and only three 3'azido-nucleotides (AzATP, AzGTP and AzCTP, collectively referred to as AzVTPs) are supplemented. Due to the omission of AzTTP, stochastic termination of cDNA synthesis cannot occur during reverse transcription of the poly(A)-tail. Rather, termination can only occur in the 3'UTR at a distance upstream of the poly(A) tail defined by the ratio of AzVTPs to dNTPs.
Applications.
ClickSeq and Poly(A)-ClickSeq provide specific applications over other common RNA-seq techniques. These include:

Holzen Abbey

Holzen Abbey ("Kloster Holzen") was a convent of Benedictine nuns at the village of Holzen (west of the B2 at Nordendorf above the Schmutter) in Allmannshofen in Bavaria, Germany.
History.
Legend recounts that it was founded in 1150 by Marquard von Donnersberg as a double monastery of Benedictine monks and nuns below the present site. After the women's convent was enlarged in the 15th century the abbey of monks was dissolved in 1470 as part of the Melker reform. Maria Langenmantel was abbess (master) between 1538 and 1553 - she was the sister of Christoph Langenmantel, a canon who helped Martin Luther escape Augsburg in 1518.
It was made an abbey in 1617 and rebuilt between 1696 and 1704, with the new church consecrated in 1710. The new building contains a Baroque interior with rich stucco work by Benedikt Vogel and sculptures by Ehrgott Bernhard Bendl. It held a pilgrimage to the Christ Child from 1740 onwards. During secularization the monastery was dissolved and handed over to the princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, although the nuns were allowed to stay in the monastery. The whole complex passed by marriage to the counts of Fischler-Treuberg in 1813.
Between July and October 1877 the painter Wilhelm Leibl lived on the monastic lands in Holzen and his home became a meeting place for the painters from Munich who gathered around him, as well as where he painted his portrait of Rosine Edle von Poschinger, sister of Bismarck's biographer Heinrich von Poschinger. He also painted Count Treuberg, whose son Ernst Ludwig Count Fischler von Treuberg in 1904 married Hetta Countess Treuberg, later known as a pacifist, who stayed on at Holzen until their divorce in 1914. Ferdinand Fischler von Treuberg's relative Pedro II of Brazil often visited Holzen, as did Carlo Caputo, apostolic nuncio to the king of Bavaria. The Treuberg family sold the monastery buildings to the St. Josef Congregation of Ursberg via a middleman in 1927. They turned it into a facility for people with disabilities, offering living and working opportunities. It also hosts a hotel for cyclists on the Romantic Road.

His singles main draw appearances on the Grand Prix tour all came in 1988, at Key Biscayne, Schenectady and Indianapolis. As a doubles player he made all of his Grand Prix appearances partnering Charles Beckman, with their best performance coming at the 1988 OTB Open in Schenectady, where they made the semi-finals. He made it to 103 in the world in doubles, with appearances at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open, as well as two Challenger titles.
He has been the Director of the Santa Barbara Tennis Club since 1996.

2018 Winter Olympics.
Prior to competing in the 2018 Winter Games, Madrazo was a triathlete who competed professionally in a number of events. He became interested in cross-country skiing after reading an article about Peruvian cross-country skier Roberto Carcelén in a sports magazine. He contacted Carcelén to ask for his advice and later travelled to South America where he met other skiers and coaches. Along with Chilean skier Yonathan Jesús Fernández and Tongan skier Pita Taufatofua, he formed an independent training group in an attempt to qualify for the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The three skiers, under the initiative of Taufatofua, rented a cabin in Hittisau, Austria, and trained for 10 hours daily. He formed part of the Mexican Ski Federation component of the Mexican delegation to the 2018 Olympics, along with alpine skiers Sarah Schleper and Rodolfo Dickson, and freestyle skier Roberto Franco.
At the opening ceremony in PyeongChang, Madrazo acted as the flag bearer for team Mexico. Sporting a traditional charro hat, Madrazo received praise for his high "level of happy" at the opening ceremony.
Later, Madrazo competed in the Men's 15km Cross-country skiing event. Although Madrazo came in last of those who finished (116), he was once again praised for his undying level of enthusiasm as he celebrated his presence at the Olympics waving a Mexican flag given by a fan. Taufatofua, who finished 114 and about 3 minutes ahead, waited for him at the finish line. Winner Dario Cologna of Switzerland returned to the finish line to shake his hand.

Pine Grove, Nevada

Pine Grove is a ghost town in Lyon County, Nevada, United States.
History.
In 1866, gold-bearing rock was discovered in the area by William Wilson. The Wheeler Mine was established in the next year. Early settlers named the camp after the nearby Pine Grove Hills.
By 1868, a post office had opened, along with a weekly newspaper. The population at the time was 200. Two steam-powered stamp mills were built along with three arrastras, which processed silver and gold ore. The camp reached its peak in population in the early 1870s with 600 residents.
The settlement, at its height, was divided into five sections and was spread out for a mile. It offered five saloons, three hotels, multiple stores, blacksmith shops, a dance hall, barber shops, a school, livery stable and two doctors' offices. Pine Grove was a regional supply center. Two mill expansions were made in 1882, and mining was robust in the 1880s. After the economic depression in the U.S. in 1893, mine production was slowly abandoned.
Work started again in the mines between 1900 and 1910, but production never reached the activity of the 1870s and 1880s. There was limited prospecting in the area in the early 1900s, but all mining had ceased by 1918. The remaining town residents left Pine Grove by the 1930s.

Hypericum kalmianum

Hypericum kalmianum, commonly called Kalm's St. Johns wort or Kalm's St. Johnswort, is a flowering plant in the St. John's wort family Hypericaceae. It is native to the Great Lakes region in the northern United States and southern Canada. "Hypericum kalmianum" was named after its discoverer, Swedish botanist Pehr Kalm (1715-1779).
Description.
"Hypericum kalmianum" is a slender shrub that grows to a height of . Its bark is whitish and papery. It has ascending four-edged branches that bear two-edged branchlets. The crowded bluish-green leaves are linear to oblanceolate and long. One to ten yellow flowers are borne on terminal and open corymbs, with each flower measuring wide. The leaf-like sepals are oblong and long. The ovoid capsules typically have five carpels and styles, though they can occasionally bear three, four, or six. The capsules are long and thick.
The plant flowers between June and August.
Taxonomy.
Formerly included within "Hypericum kalmianum" is another species first formally described in 2016, "Hypericum swinkianum". Both species are part of the subsection "Hypericum" subsect. "Centrosperma ("H." sect. "Myriandra"). "H. kalmianum" can be differentiated from "H. swinkianum" by its narrower leaves, flowerheads averaging fewer than 7 flowers, and an affinity toward calcareous rather than acidic habitats. Additional species of Midwestern "Hypericum" closely related to these two may be yet to be described.
Distribution and habitat.
Kalm's St. Johnswort is primarily found around the Great Lakes in Ontario, Quebec, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In the Chicago Region, it is a highly conservative species that occurs near Lake Michigan in calcareous sand prairies and marly pannés, and though rarely seen inland, can be found in prairie fens and mesic prairies. It is classified as an endangered species in Illinois and threatened in Ohio.

Carlo Caputo

Carlo Caputo (5 November 1843, Naples – 25 September 1908, Naples) was a Roman Catholic priest. He was diocesan bishop of Monopoli and Aversa, then titular bishop of Nikomedia and from 1904 to 1907 apostolic nuncio to the Kingdom of Bavaria.
Life.
He studied in Naples and was ordained priest by cardinal Sisto Riario Sforza on 16 March 1867. He then studied at the academy for noble clergymen in Rome, where he entered the church's diplomatic service. He then worked in the Roman Curia as a speaker in the College of Cardinals for exceptional ecclesiastical affairs, before returning to Italy, where on 18 March 1883 he was appointed Bishop of Monopoli, receiving episcopal ordination on 15 May the same year. He was promoted to Bishop of Aversa on 7 June 1886, where he stayed until 19 April 1897, the date on which he was made titular bishop of Nikomedia and head of the Territorial Prelature of Altamura-Gravina-Acquaviva delle Fonti. Caputo remained diocesan prelate until January 1904. He was made Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria on 14 January 1904, based in Munich – there were no other nuncios in Germany so he also acted as nuncio for the rest of the country. He fell ill with stomach cancer and had to resign his nunciature in August 1907, returning to Naples, where he died a year later.

Three Wise Men (2016 film)

Three Wise Men is a 2016 Nigerian comedy drama film, produced and directed by Opa Williams and Pat Ogbere Imobhio respectively. The film premiered to a select audience on December 4, 2016 with several notable film practitioners in attendance. The film tells a story of the social adventures of three elderly men, who seek to have fun after getting their pension from the government.
Synopsis.
Irikele (Richard Mofe Damijo) is an extroverted pensioner, who is very experienced in dealing with women and the younger generations. He tries to influence his friends to indulge in his sexual and emotional experiences. He has been divorced severally, and was threatened with death by two of his irresponsible sons, who felt he was being selfish with his wealth.
Timi (Zack Orji) is a friend of Irikele, who is married to an extremely religious women, he shares similarly ideologies over the fantasies of Irikele but often needs someone to push and encourage him before making real moves, however as the film progresses he became more comfortable with that lifestyle.
Tobere (Victor Olaotan) is the most principled among the three friends. He loves his wife and wouldn't do anything to hurt her. However, with peer pressure from his two friends who don't seem to share his moral beliefs, it became increasingly difficult for him to uphold them.
Reception.
Wilfred Okiche for 360nobs praised the acting of the main cast, with particular acclaim for Richard Mofe Damijo, describing the film as genuinely funny, but downplayed the roles the leading women were made to play in the film as cliche. It noted that "Tobere" has gotten so engrossed to his role in "Tinsel (TV series)", that it was difficult for him to play a character opposite of what "Ade Williams" represented in the series. It concluded its review by stating that the last 10 minutes of the film were completely unnecessary and a total detach from the remaining parts off the film. Joy Dibia for Xplorenollywood also criticized the unneeded evangelical nature of the latter parts of the film, although she rated it an 8 out of 10 for its genuinely comedic theme and powerful acting. "True Nollywood Stories" titled its review "Opa Williams returns to filmmaking with an eyesore".

Freedom Farm Cooperative

Freedom Farm Cooperative was an agricultural cooperative in Sunflower County, Mississippi, founded by American civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer in 1969 as a rural economic development and political organizing project. With a farm and a pig-raising program as well as an affordable housing development and financing, and a host of supplemental programs, the Freedom Farm Cooperative sought to create the conditions of self-sufficiency for African American farmers that alleviated poverty and remove the economic precarity white landowners used to prevent African American farmers from exercising in the political rights. Hamer founded the project after she was fired and evicted, leaving her penniless, for registering to vote in 1962. 
Background.
In the Jim Crow era, the United States Department of Agriculture imposed a variety of policies that caused African American farmers to lose farmland as well as systematically rejected their loan applications to buy land. This (among other federal government policies that disadvantaged African Americans) forced many into sharecropping or other low-wage jobs, or to leave the area altogether, moving north or west in search of job opportunities. In the Mississippi Delta where Hamer founded her project, African American farmers lost approximately 12 million acres of land, including six million between 1950 and 1964, shortly before Hamer launched her effort.
Hamer, born in 1917 in Mississippi, grew up in the midst of these conditions. The youngest child of sharecroppers, at age six joined them in the plantation fields picking cotton. She attended school until age 12 when she left to work full time and after she married in 1944, she and her husband also worked on a Mississippi plantation, until 1962. Hamer was the plantation's timekeeper, as its only laborer who knew how to read and write. In 1962, however, she joined the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and in August participated in an action to register to vote. The plantation owner fired her for this; her husband was required to stay through the harvest and then most of their land was taken. The couple moved to Ruleville, Mississippi (in rural Sunflower County) with almost nothing. 
Hamer continued to organize and made notable advances in the political arena—her speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention that helped lead to the Voting Rights Act of 1965—but saw a simultaneous need for work for economic opportunity as a mode of activism that could foster political freedom. Her own firing and eviction for voting was not an isolated incident and she saw the threat of lost livelihood constraining African American efforts to exercise political rights in the Mississippi Delta. In a magazine interview in 1968, she said: "Where a couple of years ago white people were shooting at Negroes trying to register, now they say, 'go ahead and register—then you'll starve.'"
Founding.
As an economic response to the widespread poverty, but also as a political project in response to the white landowners who evicted African American farmers who tried to vote, Hamer began planning the Freedom Farm Cooperative. In 1969 she received a $10,000 contribution from Measure for Measure, a nonprofit in Madison, Wisconsin. This, as well as support from singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte, allowed Hamer to buy 40 acres of land for a cooperative farm in Ruleville, where poverty was severe and worsening. The immediate goals of the Freedom Food Cooperative (FFC) were threefold: to improve nutrition, affordable housing and entrepreneurship opportunities for African Americans.
The cooperative structure allowed families to trade work hours for a bushel of the farm's produce. Over 1,500 families participated (although even at one dollar a month, only 30 families could afford to pay dues). They grew cash crops (to pay taxes and other overhead costs of operating the FFC) and vegetables for sustenance, including snap peas, butter beans, squash, peas, and cucumbers. In an era with widespread sharecropping, the cooperative stood as an example of the importance of owning land, something Hamer emphasized: "Land is the key. It's tied to voter registration." Owning land meant owning the food from it, and the political freedom that came with that. 
Hamer also constructed 200 affordable housing units on the FFC land. As of 2020, some of these homes are still standing in Ruleville. More generally, the FFC's financial services helped thousands of families in rural Mississippi buy homes that had heat and running water for the first time. This improved and stabilized housing was a dramatic change in Sunflower county where 90% of African American homes lacked indoor plumbing; and where, in 1969, white owners evicted more than 100 African American sharecropping families from their shacks or tents on the plantation.
In addition to these programs, the FFC also had a Head Start preschool, a commercial kitchen, and a garment factory. The FFC offered assistance to those who lost their jobs or their homes (or both) in retaliation for voting, and gave local tenant and sharecropping farmers access to education as well as job training in healthcare and disaster relief (important as mechanization was eliminating many farming jobs).
Expansion and pig bank.
One year into the project, a donation from the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) allowed Hamer to purchase another 640 acres and launch a pig bank—Hamer felt owning a pig was a bulwark against starvation. When the pigs arrived (five male pigs, which were Jersey boars, and 50 female pigs, which were Yorkshire gilts), the FFC threw a welcome party to celebrate with food, dancing, singing, and handshaking. 
The "Sunflower Pigs" arrived to a breeding barn local women (who were at the time often the more experienced farmers) had built. A loan system was set up whereby families would take a gilt on loan and pay "interest" to the pig bank in the form of piglets. Once the pigs reached the proper weight, the families would butcher them, which gave a family a year's worth of ham and lard and reduced their dependence on purchasing from the plantation commissary. This self-reliance challenged existing power structures, freeing African American farmers otherwise trapped in debt by the sharecropping system. It also fostered political freedom. In addition to white plantation owners like Hamer's former boss who fired African American farmers for voting, politicians like Mississippi congressman Jamie Whitten, who sat on the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee, retaliated against the voting rights movement by impeding federal programs that might have sent food aid to African Americans in the Delta. By offering a reliable food source, the FFC removed that lever of coercion. The farm cooperative and pig bank, eliminating food insecurity, meant African American farmers no longer had to risk starvation to vote.
Closing.
While the FFC was succeeding in feeding the community, it was not immediately financially solvent on its own and the lack of strong institutional support began weakening the organization. Organizational disagreements, in some cases, as well as a general economic downturn caused funders to pull out. Meanwhile, a series of floods and droughts in 1972 and 1973 ruined the harvest of cash crops the FFC depended on to make its mortgage payments. Hamer had personally been a major source of income, using her fees as a sought-after national and international speaker to bolster the organization, but by 1974 her health was failing and her travel ceased. The FFC closed in 1976 and Hamer died of breast cancer the following year, at age 59.

Days for Girls

Days for Girls (DfG) is a nonprofit organization that prepares and distributes sustainable menstrual health solutions to girls who would otherwise miss school during their monthly periods. DfG was founded in 2008 by American woman Celeste Mergens. After visiting an orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya, she discovered that menstruating girls stayed in their dormitories for days, sitting on cardboard to absorb their flow, because they could not afford feminine hygiene products. Her first response was to organize donations of disposable sanitary pads, but she realized that this was not a sustainable solution — and the girls had no way to dispose of used pads. She then developed the idea of creating washable, reusable pads and providing the girls with a personal kit of all they would need to continue their schooling with hygiene and dignity. By 2018, the DfG Kits (designed to last up to three years) and health education programs had reached more than one million girls and women in over 100 countries.
DfG Kits are made by volunteers who either work as "solo sewists" or form "teams", some of which go on to acquire the status of "chapters". These groups have formed in many countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each kit is in a draw-string bag and includes reusable cloth menstrual pads made up of colorful shields and liners, panties, a washcloth and soap, zip-closure plastic bags and other items. The kit enables girls to carry their clean and used pads discreetly and to take care of their own hygiene needs. During the distributions, women and girls also receive health education to break stigmas and cultural taboos associated with menstruation. 
In 2012, Days for Girls International launched an Enterprise Program to help local women establish social enterprises to make and distribute kits in their own countries. Close to 70 Days for Girls Enterprises now exist in more than a dozen countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In select regions and in order to improve sustainability, DfG kits also come with menstrual cups, which have a longer use life than washable cloth pads.
Days for Girls International is headquartered in Bellingham, Washington, United States, and has offices in Ghana, Guatemala, Nepal, and Uganda. The organization's impact and transparency have earned high ratings from GuideStar. Celeste Mergens, the organization's founder and CEO, was awarded a Purpose Prize by AARP in 2017.
In 2019 Days for Girls was awarded $250,000 by Goldman Sachs, as the cause supported by the first-place winner in the "Goldman Sachs Gives" Analyst Impact Fund competition, where analysts from the firm compete to gain support for their chosen non-profit.

Matthew Falder

Matthew Alexander Falder (born 24 October 1988) is a convicted English serial sex offender and blackmailer who coerced his victims online into sending him degrading images of themselves or into committing crimes against a third person such as rape or assault. He managed this by making threats to the victim by saying he will send their family or friends degrading info or revealing pictures of the them (which he usually obtained earlier by obtaining a false trust with the victim) if they did not comply to his commands. Falder hid behind anonymous accounts on the web and then re-posted the images to gain a higher status on the dark web. Investigators said that he "revelled" in getting images to share on hurtcore websites. The National Crime Agency (NCA), described him as "one of the most prolific and depraved offenders they had ever encountered."
Falder pleaded guilty to 137 charges from 46 complainants, making him one of the UK's most prolific convicted sex offenders. In February 2018 he was jailed for 32 years and ordered to serve a further six years on extended licence. The Court of Appeal later reduced the term of imprisonment to 25 years, with an extended licence of 8 years.
Early life and career.
Falder grew up in Knutsford, Cheshire. He attended Kings School in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where it was reported that he had "excelled".
After school he attended Clare College of the University of Cambridge, specialising in seismic oceanography and earning masters and doctoral degrees. At the time of his arrest, he was working as a post-doctoral researcher and lecturer in geophysics at the University of Birmingham. Falder was well-liked in his peer group, and was described as being extroverted, funny and larger than life.
Sexual offences.
Falders' offending was detected as long ago as 2009. He did not meet any of his victims; all of his crimes were committed using the dark web. Falder manipulated young men, women and children to photograph themselves in compromising positions and then offered the images online. In April 2015, the NCA discovered someone posting to the hurtcore websites under the name "666devil", who later turned out to be Falder.
NCA officers arrested Falder in his office at his place of work on 21 June 2017. When they read out a list of the offences he was suspected of committing, Falder remarked that it sounded "like the rap sheet from hell". 
Falder's victims numbered over 50, and it took over 30 minutes to read out the charges to him at Birmingham Crown Court. Originally charged with 188 offences, he pleaded not guilty to 51 of them; the prosecution accepted this, but they were ordered to remain on file. Falder used various accounts on several websites to pose as a young girl or woman named 'Liz'. On the dark web Falder used names such as 'inthegarden', '666devil' and 'evilmind'. Falder had seventy different online identities.
He lured people into taking photographs of themselves in humiliating situations. He blackmailed one person into raping a four-year-old child. Falder engaged in hurtcore, which police have characterised as manipulating others into performing acts of "rape, murder, sadism, torture, paedophilia, blackmail, humiliation and degradation". One of Falder's victims was just 14 years old; Falder said online he would willingly “mentally fuck her up” and added, “I am not sure I care if she lives or dies.” Falder increased the pressure on his victims, at least four of whom attempted suicide. When one of his victims pleaded for the abuse to end or else they would kill themselves, Falder replied that the images he already had on them would be circulated on the Internet anyway. Falder maintained he could not be caught and said he did not care if the victims lived or died.
In addition to the National Crime Agency (NCA), the investigation to uncover his identity involved GCHQ, US Homeland Security, Europol, Australian Federal Police, New Zealand Police, and the Israel Police; it lasted four years. Will Kerr of the NCA feels tech companies gave less than ideal cooperation with the police during the enquiry. Kerr maintains accounts were closed down possibly preventing police identifying other victims and identifying patterns of offending. Kerr fears this may have delayed identifying offenders and Kerr wants government action to make tech companies cooperate better in future. The NCA detailed crimes such as blackmailing people into eating faeces, licking toilet seats and tampons and persuading people to eat dog food. They described him as "one of the most prolific and depraved offenders they had ever encountered".
On 16 October 2017, Falder pleaded guilty to 137 offences against 46 victims, making him one of the most prolific sex offenders in British history. At Birmingham Crown Court on 19 February 2018, Judge Philip Parker sentenced Falder to 32 years in prison, and ordered him to serve a further 6 years on extended licence after his release. Falder will not be eligible for parole until he is at least 50 years old. If the Parole Board believes that Falder continues to pose a danger to the public or to children, he may have to serve the full 32 years in prison. The judge at the sentencing hearing described Falder as an "internet highwayman" who was "warped and sadistic" and whose behaviour was "cunning, persistent, manipulative and cruel." After sentencing, investigators released footage of his arrest and described how Falder "revelled" in the anguish and pain that he had caused.
Ruona Iguyovwe, of the CPS, said, “Matthew Falder is a highly manipulative individual who clearly enjoyed humiliating his many victims and the impact of his offending in this case has been significant. He deliberately targeted young and vulnerable victims. At least three victims are known to have attempted suicide and some others have inflicted self-harm. There was a high degree of sophistication and significant planning by Falder due to his use of encryption software and technology in his electronic communication and the use of multiple fake online identities and encrypted email addresses.” Prosecutors stated Falder lived a double life, a graduate of Cambridge University and Birmingham University researcher during the day and a sexual predator at night. Police officer Matt Sutton said, ‘In more than 30 years of law enforcement I’ve never come across an offender whose sole motivation was to inflict such profound anguish and pain. Matthew Falder revelled in it. I’ve also never known such an extremely complex investigation with an offender who was technologically savvy and able to stay hidden in the darkest recesses of the dark web. This investigation represents a watershed moment. Falder is not alone so we will continue to develop and deliver our capabilities nationally for the whole law enforcement system to stop offenders like him from wrecking innocent lives. I commend the victims for their bravery and I urge anyone who is being abused online to report it. There is help available.’
Javed Khan of Barnardo's stated, "This [32-year prison] sentence sends a message to paedophiles that they will pay for their crimes while, hopefully giving other child abuse victims the confidence to come forward and seek justice. (...) Barnardo’s wants to encourage parents to talk to their children about the potential dangers online and know what new apps they’re using and which websites they’re visiting, so they can help keep them safe. Barnardo’s also wants tech companies to sign up to an online code of practice to protect children, incorporate safety features when designing products and take action as soon as abuse becomes flagged. Children and young people need to know how to report abuse through age appropriate relationships and sex education."
Falder appealed against his sentence. On 16 October 2018, the Court of Appeal reduced the term of imprisonment to 25 years, with an extended licence of 8 years.
A spokesperson for the University of Birmingham said, "The University is shocked to hear of the abhorrent crimes committed by a former post-doctoral researcher.”
The University of Cambridge stated after the sentencing that they were "actively pursuing" ways of stripping Falder of his academic qualifications. The university could not say if there was a precedent of a removal process for its alumni.

Groupe des Dix

The Groupe des Dix (the Group of Ten) was the name given to a group of notable French personalities (mostly philosophers and scientists) who would regularly meet up between 1969 and 1976.
History.
The Groupe des Dix was formed in 1969. The atmosphere was one of openness and conviviality: the meetings were not recorded and the participants felt that they had a maximum amount of freedom to be themselves and discuss their ideas. The group formed with the purpose of better informing political action in the light of recent scientific discoveries. The group explored many topics and occasionally invited high status speakers to speak about their work. The group had a transdisciplinary vision. Discussions were diverse and occurred largely on a background in cybernetics, systems theory, neurobiology and information theory. Some of the disciplines regularly discussed were: anthropology, ecology, evolutionary psychology, economics and media studies. Many members influenced each other's future works.
Some of the members of the group were: Henri Atlan, Jacques Attali, Jean-François Boissel, Robert Buron, Joël de Rosnay, Henri Laborit, André Leroi-Gourhan, Edgar Morin, René Passet, Michel Rocard, Jacques Robin, Jacques Sauvan, Jack Baillet, Alain Laurent and Michel Serres.

Looking Glass (film)

Looking Glass is a 2018 American thriller film directed by Tim Hunter and starring Nicolas Cage. It was released in the United States by Momentum Pictures on February 16, 2018.
Plot.
Ray and Maggie have lost their child to an accident. Longing for a fresh start, they purchase a motel from Ben in a small town located somewhere in the California desert on the way to Las Vegas. 
Hours after their arrival, Ben calls Ray briefly, and disconnects his cellphone number soon after. Due to Ben’s weird behavior, Ray becomes suspicious and soon discovers a secret underground hallway, leading to a tiny room with a one-way mirror that allows to secretly observe motel room No. 10. 
A young woman named Jessica soon moves into the motel. Ray and Maggie also make acquaintance with Tommy, a likable truck driver who regularly frequents motel room No. 10 in company of a prostitute, Howard, a local deputy sheriff who comes by the motel every few days to have coffee as well as the gas station owner and his mechanics on the other side of the road. 
Ray feels more and more uncomfortable due to Howard’s and the gas station staffs’ odd behavior. He notices that Howard keeps asking if he knew Ben’s whereabouts and that Jessica has nightly visits from another blonde woman (Strawberry Blonde). As Maggie moves Jessica to room No. 10, Ray spies on her and Strawberry Blonde through the one-way mirror and sees them have BDSM sex. Later that night, after Strawberry Blonde and Ray have left, Jessica is strangled to death by a masked assailant. 
One night, Ray and Maggie go to a casino. As they come back, they find the slashed corpse of a pig in the motel’s swimming pool with a note stuffed into the stomach reading “Crissy”. Ray drives to the desert and burns the corpse. As he comes back, he meets Tommy and tells him about the pig. Tommy says a young local woman named Crissy had committed suicide in the pool by cutting her stomach open. 
The next morning, Howard comes over. He appears to be suspicious of Ray for not calling the police for the pig corpse. He starts to interrogate him and reveals to him that Crissy was actually murdered in the night after Ray and Maggie had first visited the motel prior to them buying it and that her murderer has not yet been caught. He also reveals that he spoke to the gas station staff who have had an eye on Ray ever since that visit. After Howard repeatedly asks Ray if he murdered Crissy and Ray repeatedly nervously denies, Howard starts to laugh and appears to believe him. Ray and Maggie later see a news report about Jessica, who has been found murdered in the desert.
Soon, Strawberry Blonde moves back into the motel and insists on getting room No. 10. Ray propositions her, but she ignores it. Later that night, Ray watches her and another woman have BDSM sex, but also notices a man sitting around the corner in the bathroom.
Later Ray hears a noise and sees a man running away from the motel after having splashed red paint on the motel. Angrily Ray goes across the street and accuses the gas station manager of being involved, but the manager denies involvement. 
When Strawberry Blonde leaves, he follows her car to a bar and interrogates her about Jessica’s death since she had been with her the night she died, but Strawberry Blonde does not answer his questions and reveals she knows about the one-way mirror. A man attacks Ray, but Ray pulls a revolver and knocks him unconscious. He tells Strawberry Blonde to stay away from his motel. 
When Ray returns to the motel, Maggie is furious and reveals that Howard had interrogated her about him. Strawberry Blonde had also advised her to keep an eye on Ray. They have a fight, but Ray manages to calm Maggie down and shows her the one-way mirror, admitting to her having watched other people have sex. 
Ray is convinced something happened in motel room No. 10. He decides the only way to find out is to speak to Ben. After calling many people and asking them to leave Ben a message, Ben finally calls and agrees to meet Ray in the desert. As they meet, Ben seems to be confused and suffering from paranoia. Ray tells Ben he knows about the one-way mirror and calls him a pervert, but Ben answers, he was studying human sociology. He offers Ray to pay him back fifty percent of the purchase price and advises him to immediately leave town. Suddenly, a gunshot strikes Ben to the chest and kills him. Ray sees a car speeding off in the distance. 
Realizing he is in danger, he calls Maggie and asks her to pack up her things. Upon arriving at the motel, he notices Howard’s police car in the parking lot and finds signs of a struggle in his apartment. Looking through the one-way mirror, he sees Maggie gagged and restrained to the bed with Howard laying in wait for him. Howard tells Maggie he plans to kill her and Ray, making it look like Ray killed her and then committed suicide. Ray lures Howard to the mirror, then breaks through it and attacks him. Howard says he now understands how Ben knew what he did, revealing why he was so anxious to find him. They have a scuffle, but Ray manages to get hold of a pistol and kills Howard. He frees Maggie and they speed off by car.
Reception.
Critical response.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 17% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. On Metacritic, which assigns normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
"The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that "even the actors' fine efforts cannot rescue "Looking Glass" from terminal murkiness." Eric Cohn of IndieWire described Nicolas Cage's character as a "bored peeping tom" and called the film "VOD bait" in his negative review. Robert Abele of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that the playground in which the film operates "should be enough to make for a satisfyingly disreputable thriller" but that hoping for one "doesn't equal results." Jesse Hessenger of "The A.V. Club" wrote, "Despite [Cage's] presence and the movie's atmosphere, "Looking Glass" is just another murder mystery without enough suspects."
Similarity to Gerald Foos.
Reviewers, such as Craig Lindsey of the "Los Angeles Times", note the similarity of the motel's setup to the case of Gerald Foos, a former motel owner in Colorado who had modified his motel to allow him to spy on most of the rooms. Foos' setup was documented by Gay Talese in the 2016 "New Yorker" article "The Voyeur's Motel".

Abdul Haq Baloch

Abdul Haq Baloch, also known as Abdul Baloch (August 12, 1978 – September 29, 2012), was a Pakistani TV journalist for the broadcast station ARY Television, in Khuzdar, Khuzdar District, Balochistan Province, Pakistan. He was also general secretary of Khuzdar Press Club. The broadcast reporter was murdered in 2012 and his murderers remain unidentified.
Personal.
Abdul Baloch was born on August 12, 1978. He had a wife and family whose names are unidentified. Baloch was murdered at the age 34. Baloch was from Khuzdar, Pakistan.
Career.
Abdul Haq Baloch had been a correspondent of ARY Television for ten years. His employer was located in Khuzdar, which is a part of Balochistan Province, Pakistan. Baloch reported issues pertaining to politics, government, and war. Baloch's reporting could have been a factor in his murder. Tensions were high after the Balochistan High Court barred news coverage of banned groups in October 2011. Many banned groups had become angry because local journalists were not reporting on their military affiliations. He was also general secretary at the Khuzdar Press Club. 
Death.
On September 29, 2012, Abdul Baloch was murdered on his drive home from a Khuzdar Press Club meeting in the city of Khuzdar in Pakistan. Four masked men on motorcycles opened fire on his car, approximately 100 yards from the press club. Baloch died from his injuries while seeking treatment from the nearest hospital. He was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. (local time) on Chaker Khan Road. 
The police registered a case against "unidentified gunmen". Minister Rehman Malik announced that the judicial commission would thoroughly investigate the killing of Abdul Baloch. The minister established a reward of 2.5 million if anyone helped identify Baloch's killers. As of 2018, his killers have remained unidentified.
Context.
The police believed that the murder was connected with the Baluch Musalah Diffa Army. The previous November, Baloch had been named on a hit list issued by a BMDA spokesman. Members of this association were angry because local journalists were refusing to report on their military operations. Baloch was one of the journalists who had refused to report on this topic. Baloch had been receiving threats from the BMDA, according to Hamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist.
Context.
Pakistan is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in South Asia. Ranked the fifth deadliest country by the Committee to Protect Journalists. A number of 89 journalists were killed in Pakistan and of those, 60 were confirmed to have been killed because of their work during 2012. Due to the rising death rate of journalists in 2012, 23 press clubs shut down in the province for more than two weeks due to threats and warnings from various affiliations. President of the Balochistan Union of Journalists, Khalil Ahmed said, 43 journalists have been killed in Balochistan, including by bomb blasts and targeted killings. An additional 25 journalists lost their lives in targeted killings while reporting in conflict zones in Balochistan. The government of Balochistan is being blamed for failing to provide security to the journalists. According to Anwar Ul Haq Kakar, spokesperson for the Balochistan government, “the government has made a security plan for the journalists, media networks, and newspaper agencies in the province. We will give protection to the news agencies who are involved in the distribution of newspapers. The government will help them in every possible way, for example, we will give the following security through Frontier Corps and Police.” Since the 2012 murders, safety regulations and guidelines have not been implemented for journalists. In fact, during the year of 2016, 728 journalists were killed within Pakistan and violence against journalists continues. 
Impact.
Another employee of ARY News was killed in Peshawar, Pakistan during violent protests against an anti-Islam film on September 21,2012. The employee died after being hit by a bullet in police firing. These two killings raised more question on whether or not journalists were safe in Pakistan.
Violence against reporters throughout the Balochistan Providence isn't uncommon and this conflict has been in ongoing since 1947. Haq is one of 23 journalists who have been killed during the last 15 years while performing their line of work in Balochistan. The now deceased journalists were reporting on politics, war, and human rights. In Baloch's case, he had been murdered because of his lack of reporting. All of these deaths have no killer assigned to these crimes. Pakistan is accounted for being the deadliest countries in the world for the press.
“Balochistan is a dangerous place for journalists to work in. Haq is the 22nd journalist to have lost his life in the line of duty in the restive province. But none of the cases has been seriously investigated and no one has been arrested or punished for these heinous crimes,” Alam and Ketkar said.
Balochistan government has constituted two different judicial tribunals to investigate six murder cases of journalists killed in the province since 2011.
A statement from the Home Department in Quetta, capital of southern Balochistan province, said that the two tribunals would work in Khuzdar and Makran districts to investigate these murder cases of journalists.
Tribunals, according to the statement, ensured the public that the investigation would hold people reliable for these murders and also recommend measures to prevent such murders of journalists in the future. The six cases under investigation were; Abdul Haq Baloch, Javed Ahmed and Munir Shakil from Khuzdar district and Abdul Razzaq, Abudost Rind and Ilyas Nazar from coastal Makran district. These six journalists were killed during 2011 and 2013.
Reactions.
Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, said, “I condemn the murder of Abdul Kahliq... I am deeply concerned about attacks on journalists and media workers in Pakistan and call on the authorities to bring those responsible for these crimes to justice. It is essential that the basic human right of freedom of expression be respected, and journalists allowed to carry out work without having to fear for their life.
Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf expressed grief at the death of Baloch and strongly condemned the incident. He directed authorities to apprehend those involved in the heinous crime and bring them to justice. 
“Journalists have been continuously targeted over the last few years. Authorities must act swiftly to end this cycle of violence and impunity,” Safma Secretary General Imtiaz Alam and SAMC President Kumar Ketkar said in a joint statement.
“Safma and SAMC support calls for an immediate inquiry into the death of Baloch, who was also the general secretary of Khuzdar Press Club, and all other journalists abducted, tortured and killed in Balochistan. It has become virtually impossible to report independently,” the heads of the media rights bodies said.
“Threats to the safety of journalists, especially those working in the conflict areas are mounting. The authorities should work towards ensuring that the journalists work in a safe environment and do not become victims of anti-media attacks,” they media rights also said.
The Balochistan Union of Journalists called upon the government to arrest the killers of journalist Abdul Haq Baloch, general secretary of the Khuzdar Press Club, who was assassinated. A protest rally outside of the Chief Minister's Secretariat was held on the following Monday of Baloch's death. BUJ leaders said the government had failed to protect lives of journalists in the province and across the country. Key members of the community who led the gathering were; Isa Tareen, Rezaur Rehman, Shezada Zulfiqar, Hamadullah Siyapa, Owais Tuhid and Matiullah Jan.

Star Leaf

Star Leaf is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Richard Cranor and starring Russell Hodgkinson, Julian Gavilanes, Shelby Truax, Tyler Trerise, Richard Cranor, and Robert Leeshock.
Plot.
The film begins with Tim (Tyler Trerise) and James (Julian Gavilanes) as Marine Snipers in the Hindu Kush mountain range of Afghanistan, on a mission to assassinate a high ranking Taliban leader. Their mission is soon compromised when a young child enters the scene, forcing James to take a risky shot that accidentally leads to the child's death.
One year later, Tim and his girlfriend Martha are on a roadtrip with James to La Push, Washington. Tim is hoping the trip to the beach will help James with his PTSD. They stop at a mysterious biker's house named Seth Guardrail Slaughter (Russell Hodgkinson) to get a map that will lead them to a legendary strain of extra-terrestrial cannabis growing in the Olympic Mountains.
The trio use the map to navigate their way towards finding the "Garden of Weeden". Eventually, they find the ET marijuana, and Martha proceeds to violate the first rule of the grove - no cell phone usage that could give away the GPS coordinates of the sacred stash.
Around a campfire they begin to smoke the Star Leaf and experience a wide range of hallucinations and visions. James starts to hear voices - Afghan voices as his PTSD begins to manifest violently. Then, a UFO flies overhead. The group cannot tell if these things are real, or just side effects of smoking Star Leaf.
To their shock, a forest ranger named Ranger Dave (Richard Cranor) suddenly enters their campsite as well. Joining them around the campfire, Ranger Dave proceeds to give an awkward and mysterious oral history of the Star Leaf, and what its spiritual effects are on those who smoke it. 
Later that night, James is woken by mysterious orbs floating inside his tent. Along with the rest of the group, they experience multiple alien encounters that force them to flee the campsite. Soon it's discovered that Tim has stolen some Star Leaf clippings, a major violation of the rules governing the Star Leaf grove, and the reason behind the growing alien interference.
The group is split up - escaping into the woods James suffers multiple PTSD flashbacks. Ranger Dave and Seth Guardrail Slaughter intervene on his behalf, offering him an opportunity to redeem himself and his friends if he's willing to return Tim's stolen Star Leaf back to the grove, despite the Alien threat. James rises to the occasion, facing his most troubling fears and returns the Star Leaf successfully, allowing him to process fully his PTSD experience in Afghanistan and leading to much needed healing for himself and Tim.
The film ends with the group finally making it to the beach and surfing the ocean waves.
Production.
"Star Leaf" premiered at the American Film Market and was part of the "Midnight Adrenaline" film series sponsored by the Seattle International Film Festival. "Star Leaf" also won best sci-fi film at the Albuquerque Film Festival. The DVD was released on November, 2015 in the United States by the MVD Entertainment Group, and included information on the making of the film. The film is available in German speaking countries courtesy of Lighthouse Films.
Reception.
Pat Torfe of Bloody Disgusting described the film as a "Fun adventure, relying on developed characters and their interactions with some good humour thrown in...Cranor has done a great job on this indie ditty, and it’ll be interesting to see what he comes up with in the future."
Simon Weedn of "Culture Magazine" wrote ""Star Leaf" portrays a dramatic struggle for survival and self-preservation that is both unexpected and brilliantly executed". 
The producers of "Star Leaf" launched their own cannabis brand in 2016, selling "ET Weed" in several stores in Washington state. 
Using marijuana-like smelling hops, a dark Star Leaf IPA beer was also created by Decibel Brewing in Bothell, WA.

The vessel was paid for through a FEMA Port Security Grant. So, in addition to being able to fight fires, her cabin is sealed, so she can respond to chemical, biological or radiological threats.
According to "WFLA" she has not been put into use since 2015, when her engines became fouled by barnacles. She is propelled by waterjets.

Australia–Spain relations

Diplomatic relations exist between Australia and Spain. In the 2016 Australian Census, 120,952 Australian residents claimed Spanish descent, while 15,391 indicated they were born in Spain. Both nations are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
History.
In 1606, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres was one of the first European explorers to encounter Australia by entering the straights between Australia and Papua New Guinea which are today named in his honor as the Torres Strait. Since the initial encounter, relations between Australia and Spain would not develop until the twentieth century.
From 1936 to 1939, Spain was embroiled in a civil war between the Republican faction and Nationalist faction. Australia, was officially neutral during the conflict, however, over 66 Australians volunteered and fought for the Republican faction in Spain as part of the British Battalion.
On 26 October 1967, Australia and Spain officially established diplomatic relations. In May 1968, Spain opened an embassy in the Australian capital of Canberra. In June 1988, King Juan Carlos I of Spain paid an official visit to Australia. In July 2017, both nations celebrated 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations.

In 2018 both countries celebrated the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations to expand and mutually reinforce them in all fields, coinciding with Australia Day. Both countries tend to develop increasingly cordial and strategic relations. 
Trade.
In 2017, trade between Australia and Spain totaled US$3.4 billion. Australian merchandise exports to Spain were valued at $697 million, and included coal, other ores and concentrates, fruit and nuts, and electronic integrated circuits. Spanish merchandise exports to Australia were valued at $2 billion, with the biggest import items being passenger motor vehicles, medicaments (including veterinary), fixed vegetable oils and fats, and rubber tires, treads and tubes.

Argiope magnifica

Argiope magnifica is a species of orb web spider found in tropical areas of north-east Queensland, Australia, eastern Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is commonly known as the magnificent St Andrew's cross spider. This species is similar in size to the sympatric "Argiope keyserlingi"; females can be distinguished from those of "A. keyserlingi" via extensive differences in abdominal colouration and patterns. The males of these two species are almost indistinguishable.
Little is known about the biology of "Argiope magnifica". However, like most orb-web spiders, males are much smaller than females. Females of this species construct web decorations. As of October 2020, there are 57 records of "Argiope magnifica" listed in the Atlas of Living Australia.

Adelaide Avery Claflin

Adelaide Avery Claflin (July 28, 1846 – May 31, 1931) was an American woman suffragist and ordained minister.
She became an ordained Unitarian minister at Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1897. She preached in Connecticut, Canada and the West. She was interested in liberal religion, natural science study, literary study and languages. She served on the School Board of Quincy, Massachusetts, 1884-87. She was interested in woman suffrage and education of women. Claflin was a member of the executive board of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. She was connected with the Boston Equal Suffrage Association. She lectured often on suffrage with Lucy Stone, Mary Livermore, and Julia Ward Howe. She campaigned in Rhode Island, 1886. Claflin was the author of occasional editorials and articles in Boston dailies, and a contributor to "Woman's Journal". She was a director of the New England Women's Club, and served as president of the Boston Castilian Club.
Early years and education.
Narcissa Adelaide Avery was born in Boston, Massachusetts, July 28, 1846. She was a daughter of Alden Avery and Lucinda Miller (Brown) Avery, both natives of Maine, and both of English ancestry, although there is a little Scotch-Irish blood on the Miller side. Claflin was the second of four children. Her father, although an active business man, had much poetical and religious feeling. He was a prominent member of the Methodist Church, and, on account of his eloquence, was often in earlier life advised to become a minister. Her mother, of a practical, common-sense temperament, had much appreciation of nature and of scientific fact, and a gift for witty and concise expression of thought. So from both parents Claflin derived the ability to speak with clearness and epigrammatic force.
She was a graduate of the Boston Girls' High School, 1862; did private study with Harvard University professors, 1864–65; and graduated from Meadville Theological School, 1896. Although in childhood attending the Methodist Church with their parents, both her sister and Claflin early adopted the Unitarian faith, and joined the church of Rev. James Freeman Clarke.
Career.
A year or two later after completing her education, she became a teacher in the Winthrop school.
She married Frederick Allan Claflin (died March 14, 1908), of Boston, November 23, 1870. They resided for many years in Quincy, Massachusetts, and had a son and three daughters. In 1883, Claflin began to speak in public as an advocate of woman suffrage. In 1884, she was elected a member of the Quincy school committee, and served three years in that position, being the first woman who held office in that town. Although she was too busy with family life to take a very active part in public life, she wrote for the Boston papers. She also lectured, and occasionally went on short lecturing tours outside of New England. Best known as a woman suffragist, she wrote and spoke on various other topics.
She died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 31, 1931.

ESL Pro League

The ESL Pro League (formerly ESL ESEA Pro League; shortened as EPL) is a "" (CS:GO) professional esports league. It is based on four regions: Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania, and currently comprises 24 teams each season, including 12 Permanent Partner Teams. The ESL Pro League is considered to be the premier professional CS:GO league in the world and is one of the major professional leagues in esports. The ESL Pro League began as a venture between the Electronic Sports League (ESL) and E-Sports Entertainment Association League (ESEA). Its inaugural season started on May 4, 2015.
History.
In early November 2014, the German-based Electronic Sports League announced the creation of the ESL Pro League as the European ESL league. On April 28, 2015, ESL announced a joint venture with the North American-based E-Sports Entertainment Association League to provide a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league with US$500,000 in total prize money in the first season between two continents. It later expanded to fourteen teams per region and raised its prize pool to US$1,000,000, with two seasons running each year. ESL the prize pool once more in 2018 by making the teams fight for $1,000,000 in the Finals, raising the season prize pool by $250,000. In addition, the number of teams in the finals rose to sixteen, with more teams from regions other than North American and Europe participating in the Finals. In 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, seasons 11 and 12 did not have a global final, instead regional finals were held in Europe and North America. In 2021, for ESL Pro League Season 13, the organization announced a changed format, with one league replacing the four regional leagues that existed prior to the pandemic. All 24 teams would travel to Europe to participate in the league, with the top 12 teams of the 24 team regular season proceeding to the finals, also in Europe. With the consolidation of the tournament into one event, the prize pool was reduced to $750,000.
Format.
The first season featured twelve teams from each continent that were invited by ESL to participate in its inaugural season that started on May 4, 2015 with Team Dignitas defeating Titan. In the first three seasons, the EPL gave the top four teams in each league a ticket to the finals on an offline (LAN) tournament. Starting with Season 4, ESL decided to expand the Pro League to 28 teams, so that there would be fourteen teams per league. This also meant that six teams from each region would qualify for the offline finals. For each regular season, teams would play every team twice in its respective league, so that each team played twenty-two games for the first three seasons and twenty-four games from season four to season seven. However, in Season 7, two teams – Counter Logic Gaming and Misfits – dropped their rosters and forfeited their Pro League licenses, reducing the number of North American teams to twelve. Also in season 7, ESL decided to expand geographically by creating the Asia-Pacific and LA LEAGUE (South America) divisions, bumping the number of teams up from 24 to 40. This was later for season 9 changed to four regions as North America and South America were integrated into one region. In addition, the Europe and Americas region features offline group play. Season 9 featured eight teams from Europe, six teams from the Americas, one team from Asia, and one team from the Oceania region.
The first three offline finals had eight teams, in which teams were split up into two groups of four in a double-elimination, GSL group format and two teams from each group qualified for the playoffs. The playoffs featured four teams, with the semifinals being a best of three and the finals being a best of five. Starting from season four to season six, teams were split up into two groups of six and each team would play every team in its group once for the group stage. Three teams from each group qualified for the playoffs. The round of 6 and the semifinals are best of three series and the finals area best of five, with the exception of season four, in which the finals were a best of three. In season seven, with the EPL expansion, the number of teams went up to sixteen. In season thirteen, after EPL centralization, the finals became a 12 team event, with the top half of each group from the group stage advancing to a Single-Elimination Bracket.
Thirteen of the teams in the ESL Pro League automatically qualify each year through Permanent Partner Status, a revenue-sharing system ESL operates with the organizations of these thirteen teams. Of the other eleven teams, six qualify through the ESL World Ranking, a system ESL uses to measure teams' results from all significant CS:GO tournaments, including those not operated by ESL, and the remaining five qualify through regional qualifications. Regional qualifications occur through regional ESEA Premier seasons, with two taking place every ESL Pro League season, and a spot given to each season championship in Europe and North America (totaling four spots), and one final spot given to the winner of a playoff between the two winners of the ESEA Premier seasons in Oceania.
Unlike the Valve-sponsored , in which team slots are given based on the player rosters, ESL awards spots to the organization. For instance, Valve would consider SK Gaming to have won two Major Championships, as the players (FalleN, fer, coldzera, fnx, TACO) won one at MLG Columbus 2016 while under contract with Luminosity Gaming and won another at ESL One Cologne 2016 while under contract with SK Gaming. In addition, if the majority of the roster transfers to another team, Valve would give take away the spot from the old team and give it to the team that the core of the roster headed to. At ESL One Katowice 2015, PENTA Sports made it to the top eight at the tournament, giving the players a guaranteed spot at the next major, ESL One Cologne 2015; however, players denis, Spiidi, and nex were bought out by mousesports, thus giving mousesports PENTA Sports's spot at Cologne 2015 as the majority of PENTA moved to the mousesports team. EPL would consider Luminosity Gaming, which won Season 3, to have one title and SK Gaming, which won Season 6, to also have just one title. However, a team is allowed to sell or simply give its Pro League license to another organization, as in the case of Tempo Storm transferring its roster to the Immortals organization for Season 4.
Seasons.
The list of seasons and the top two teams in each season are in shown below. The number next to the teams showed what positions they placed during the regular season in their respective leagues. Regional leagues were discontinued in Season 13.
Notes
Other Leagues.
ESL also has two other leagues outside of Counter-Strike. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is currently in its eleventh season. The PENTA Sports/G2 Esports core has the most titles with four, as the team won the Year 1 Season 1, Year 2 Season 1, Year 2 Season 2, and Season 8 titles. In addition to the Rainbow Six Siege league, ESL also has a Halo league. However, the two leagues are much less prominent than the Counter-Strike league as Rainbow Six only has a $248,000 prize pool compared to CS:GO's $750,000 prize pool.

The Neverending World Tour

"The Neverending World Tour" was the umbrella name used to describe a series of concert tours by Swedish pop duo Roxette. The name was derived from the title of the duo's debut single, 1986's "Neverending Love". Their sixth and final concert tour, it took place from 23 October 2009 until 8 February 2016, and consisted of 17 separate legs which saw the duo performing a total of 256 concerts in Europe, North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, Australasia and Asia.
It was their first concert tour in over eight years, following vocalist Marie Fredriksson's brain tumour diagnosis in September 2002. That diagnosis led to the cancellation of Roxette's planned appearance at the 2002 Night of the Proms concert series. "The Neverending World Tour" began with the band performing at the 2009 edition of that series, followed by a seven-date warm-up tour of Europe the following year, and more extensive tours in support of studio albums "Charm School" (2011) and "Travelling" (2012). Despite those two albums being released over the duration of the tour, set lists primarily consisted of many of their greatest hits; Fredriksson was unable to remember the lyrics of new songs because the illness impacted her short-term memory.
The tour received generally positive reviews, with numerous publications praising Fredriksson's voice and the quality of Gessle's songwriting. It was also a commercial success; the band performed to over 2.5 million people by the time the tour concluded in 2016, with a confirmed box office figure of over US$24 million, based on 45 shows reported to "Billboard". The tour was due to be extended beyond 2016 as part of promotion for the duo's tenth studio album, "Good Karma" (2016). However, these dates were cancelled when Fredriksson was advised by her doctors to cease all touring activity, due to poor health.
Background and conception.
The duo's seventh studio album, "Room Service" (2001), was promoted by their first concert tour in almost six years. Roxette were due to follow up this tour with a stint performing on the multiple-act Night of the Proms concert series, which was to begin in October 2002 and would see the band performing throughout Europe with a live orchestra to over 630,000 attendees during 52 shows. However, on 11 September 2002, vocalist Marie Fredriksson fractured her cranium after collapsing in a bathroom in her home. MRI scans later showed she had a brain tumour in the back of her head. She underwent surgery to successfully remove the malignant tumour, followed by months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, Fredriksson was left permanently blinded in her right eye, and unable to read or write. She also could not speak for a considerable period of time afterward. All promotional activity for the duo's then-upcoming greatest hits compilation "The Ballad Hits" (2002) was subsequently cancelled, along with their scheduled appearance at Night of the Proms.
Fredriksson and Per Gessle each released solo albums over the following years, briefly reuniting as Roxette to record two new songs for their 2006 greatest hits compilation "". During the 6 May 2009 date of the "Party Crasher Tour" at the Melkweg in Amsterdam – Gessle's European tour in support of his same-titled 2008 solo album – he and his band were joined on-stage by Fredriksson to perform acoustic renditions of several Roxette songs. Immediately after the gig, Gessle announced to Swedish publication "Aftonbladet" that Roxette would perform at the 2009 edition of Night of the Proms, which would begin on 23 October. That same date, Swedish newspaper "Expressen" reported that the duo had been recording material for a new Roxette album since May 2009. Marie also joined Per on stage again on 10 May 2009 at the Cirkus in Stockholm.
Tours and recordings.
The band performed a series of seven warm-up shows throughout Europe, beginning on 4 August 2010 at Leif's Lounge – a music venue at Gessle's own Hotel Tylösand in Halmstad – and concluding on 12 September at the Saint Petersburg Ice Palace. Roxette's eighth studio album, "Charm School", was released worldwide from 11 February 2011. Deluxe editions of the CD included a bonus disc containing 12 tracks recorded live in Halmstad, Saint Petersburg and Stavanger during the 2010 tour. The "Charm School World Tour" began on 28 February 2011 and saw the band performing in Europe, Asia, South America, South Africa and the Middle East. They performed at London's Wembley Arena on 15 November, their first concert in the United Kingdom in 17 years, they last played Wembley on 15 November 1994.
Their ninth studio album, "Travelling", followed on 26 March 2012. It was a successor to 1992's "Tourism", although, unlike that album – which was recorded in various locations and settings throughout the world during their "Join the Joyride! Tour" – "Travelling" was primarily recorded in studios in Sweden in-between legs of the "Charm School World Tour". "Roxette Live: Travelling the World" was less extensive than the preceding tour: it began on 14 February and lasted seven months, taking the band to Australasia and Asia, North and South America, South Africa and Europe. The first gig of the tour, on 11 February at the Vector Arena in Auckland, was cancelled when Gessle became ill during the flight from Stockholm; it began instead two days later in Australia. Live Nation Entertainment promoted the tour, after multiple local concert promoters in the country refused to work with the duo. Tickets for their 16 February show at the Sydney Entertainment Centre sold out within 30 minutes of going on sale to the public. The band went on to perform to over 100,000 people during their ten Australian shows. By the end of 2012, they had performed 153 concerts to a total audience of 1.5 million people.
Roxette ceased all touring activity in 2013, with Gessle rejoining Gyllene Tider to release their sixth studio album, "Dags att tänka på refrängen", that April, while Fredriksson released her eighth solo album, "Nu!", later that year in November. Fredriksson and Gyllene Tider each toured separately in Sweden to support their releases. A live CD and DVD/Blu-ray box set, ', was released on 6 December 2013. The set consisted of footage from three concerts from the South American leg of "Roxette Live: Travelling the World". In 2014, Roxette began the "XXX – The 30th Anniversary Tour", with dates initially running from 28 October to 29 November and consisting of 15 concerts in North Asia and Europe. The release of a new greatest hits compilation, "Roxette XXX – The 30 Biggest Hits" on 11 November, was timed to coincide with these concerts, except in Australia, where ' was released on 6 February 2015—four days before the beginning of a tour there.
Roxette continued touring throughout 2015, performing their first concert ever in New Zealand on 7 February. The tour concluded a year later with a series of shows in South Africa; their 8 February 2016 performance at the Grand West Arena in Cape Town proved to be their final show. The duo's tenth studio album, "Good Karma", was released in June 2016. It was due to be promoted with further concerts throughout Europe over the proceeding months. However, all of these concert dates were cancelled when Fredriksson was advised by her doctors to stop all touring activity, due to poor health. She released a statement which said: "Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that [have] followed us on our long and winding journey." By the end of the tour, Roxette had performed to a total of 2.5 million people (excluding music festival appearances) in over 50 countries.
Critical reception.
Neal McClimon of "The Hague Online" gave a positive review to their 18 November 2009 Night of the Proms performance at the Rotterdam Ahoy, saying that they were given the "warmest welcome of the night. The fact that [they] had to cancel their previous tour due to Marie Fredriksson's well-documented [illness] seemed to resonate with the audience, [and they were] greeted by a crowd that offered thanks, warmth and love." He contrasted Roxette with other acts performing on the tour, writing: "There was one thing that stood out for me as they sang: they looked to be having a lot of fun, and it [was] great to see a band actually looking as though they wanted to be there." "Time Out Dubai" said that the duo "put on a phenomenal performance" for their 20 May 2011 concert at the Dubai World Trade Centre, but said the show was spoiled by the poor acoustics at the venue. They were also disappointed by the "lacklustre" crowd and asked: "If you want to stand and stare at your BlackBerry, what's the point of buying a ticket?"
The 2012 tour also received positive reviews. A writer for AusPop complimented the set list of their 14 February performance at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, particularly the "near-flawless finale of mega hits", although was critical of the inclusion of "7Twenty7" – an album track from 1999's "Have a Nice Day" – "one of their least successful albums in Australia, which ultimately had everyone back in their seats." Their gig four days later in Melbourne was praised by the "Herald Sun", which said: "From opener 'Dressed for Success', they had one of the most rapturous reactions the Rod Laver Arena has seen in years." "The West Australian" praised the entire band, writing that they "owned" Challenge Stadium during their two concerts at the Perth venue at the end of February. Fredriksson's performance at the Manchester Arena on 4 July was singled out for praise from "The Guardian"s Dave Simpson, who said that "the poignancy she invests into their more wistful lyrics suggests [that performance is] part of her recovery."
In a review of their 31 August show at the Bell Centre, the "Montreal Gazette" praised Gessle's songwriting, saying: "There's much to be said for the way [he] has been able to take the eternal beauty of the I-IV-V chord progression (think "Wild Thing" or "Twist and Shout") – one of rock's most basic and perfect statements – and use it as a foundation for his own evergreens, which still sound pretty fresh. Look no farther than 'Dressed for Success' or 'How Do You Do!' for confirmation." "Rock Subculture" applauded Fredriksson in their review of the band's 14 September concert in San Francisco's Nob Hill Masonic Center, writing: "The fact that she can still put on an amazing performance like last night is simply stunning. If I had not known about her history, I would never have imagined that she had such challenges in the past and overcame them in such a way."
By the beginning of the "XXX – The 30th Anniversary Tour" in late 2014, Fredriksson performed the entirety of concerts while sitting on a chair on stage. Will Gore of "The Independent" said of their 13 July 2015 London concert that there were "any number of '80 bands who make a living from neatly-packaged nostalgia tours. But not many could sell-out The O2 Arena on their own on a Monday night. ... Yet more than any other European band of that era, Roxette bridged the pop craft of their compatriots ABBA with the rockier sensibilities of American counterparts Heart and even Madonna. Their American success is easy to forget—four number ones between 1989 and 1991. Yet they became, unfairly, regarded as a pastiche almost as quickly." He contrasted this with Fredriksson's "current physical vulnerability" while performing on stage, which he called "a genuinely moving counterpoint to the charge of soullessness which often dogged Roxette's critical reception in the past. It might not be too late for a proper reappraisal."
Andy Rudd of the "Daily Mirror" reviewed the same concert, and remarked that Fredriksson "still hit all the power high notes, despite remaining seated for all the gig." He went on to praise her "haunting" and "beautiful vocal tones". Similarly, Goldenplec writer Mary Sexton said of their 1 June concert at the 3Arena in Dublin that Fredriksson was "sensational; her voice has a gorgeous timbre switching between her delicate head voice and her lower belt voice." Although she additionally noted that "during her solo moments, there are elements of dodgy intonation which may indicate why her voice is a bit lower in the mix. But make no mistake, she is a sensation, and you cannot possibly take your eyes off of her. Her tiny frame swells and fills the stage as she commands the audiences' attention." Annelise Ball echoed a similar sentiment in her review of their 20 February concert at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, saying that "Despite her evident frailty, Fredriksson's voice is as strong and lovely as ever." She concluded by writing: "Fredriksson, you deserve accolades not only for your exceptional talent but also for your strength, courage and grace under pressure."
Set lists.
The songs performed during each leg of the tour changed considerably as it progressed, with Gessle initially singing the majority of tracks. He said: "We had to take it step by step. I sang maybe 60–65% of the songs to begin with, and then the more we played the more Marie could sing." Each tour generally consisted of a "greatest hits"-type set list, as Fredriksson's illness "affected her short-term memory, making it difficult to learn new lyrics, while the old hits are inked firmly in her brain."

Dhaka-6 is a constituency represented in the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) of Bangladesh since 2014 by Kazi Firoz Rashid of the Jatiya Party (Ershad).
Boundaries.
The constituency encompasses Dhaka South City Corporation wards 34 and 37 through 46.
History.
The constituency was created for the first general elections in newly independent Bangladesh, held in 1973.
Ahead of the 2008 general election, the Election Commission redrew constituency boundaries to reflect population changes revealed by the 2001 Bangladesh census. The 2008 redistricting added 7 new seats to the Dhaka metropolitan area, increasing the number of constituencies in the capital from 8 to 15, and reducing the extent of the constituency.
The seat became vacant upon the death of the sitting MP Mizanur Rahman Khan Dipu on 21 December 2013. It was filled in the 2014 general election two weeks later.
In the 2018 general election, the constituency was one of six chosen by lottery to use electronic voting machines.

Barney Prine

Francis Barnett Prine (known as Barney Prine) was an American pioneer who was one of the first settlers to homestead in the Ochoco country of central Oregon. When he was young, Prine traveled with his family from Missouri to Oregon's Willamette Valley over the Oregon Trail. He served in the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Prine later moved to the Central Oregon, where he established several businesses in what became Prineville, Oregon, a town named in his honor.
Early life.
Prine was born on 1 January 1841 in Jackson County, Missouri, east of Kansas City. His parents were Francis "Frank" Prine and Alice Elizabeth "Elsie" (Dealy) Prine. In 1853, Prine's family left Missouri for Oregon. Prine was only 12 years old, but he drove one of the family's wagons and took his turn standing guard at night while crossing the plains and mountains along the Oregon Trail.
The Prine family settled in Linn County in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The family established a farm approximately from Scio, Oregon, near the place where the north and south forks of the Santiam River merge. Prine attended school near Scio. As a youth, he made spending money winning foot races against other boys. At least one of his races was reported in local newspapers. His record-breaking mile run was still remembered and cited in a newspaper article three decades later.
In 1862, Prine took up a gold mining claim near Florence on the Oregon Coast. His claim was very productive, but Prine spent everything he made. He admitted to spending as much a $1,000 in a single day, gambling and buying drinks for his friends.
During the American Civil War, Prine supported the Union, serving in Company F of the 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He entered the United States Army in November 1864 and served until his company was disbanded in July 1866. His company was commanded by Captain Ebner W. Waters. During his service, Prine was recognized as an outstanding soldier and was promoted to corporal. In addition, he regularly won money from fellow soldiers in foot races, which he never lost.
After being released from the Army, Prine returned to Linn County. In 1867, he married Elizabeth "Eliza" Sylvester. He remained in Linn County until the area became too crowded for his liking.
Central Oregon pioneer.
In 1868, he moved east of the Cascade Mountains to the Ochoco country of central Oregon. He made a squatters claim on property along the Crooked River, near Mill Creek. He was 27 years old at that time. His wife was one of the first women to settle in the area. Their first son was born at their homestead site a year later.
When he arrived in central Oregon, Prine built a crude cabin using juniper and willow logs, topped with a thatched roof of willow stems and ryegrass turf. He also opened a primitive blacksmith shop and a small store. He hauled goods for his store from The Dalles on the Columbia River while he salvaged iron from abandoned wagons for his blacksmith shop. Prine later added a saloon and a stable to his property. After the stable was built, he began keeping race horses there. Eventually, he laid out a course along the river for horse racing. He regularly sponsored horse races to boost liquor sales at his saloon.
At that time, central Oregon was a wild frontier area without any formal law enforcement. According to Prine, property theft and murder were common. Prine noted that this problem was solved by lynching thieves and murderers.
In 1871, the Prine post office was established. Later that year, Prine sold his Crooked River property and businesses to Monroe Hodges for $25 and a packhorse. The following year, the name of the post office was changed to Prineville. After taking over Prine's businesses, Hodges platted the Prineville town site. Prineville became the county seat for Crook County when that county was created by the Oregon State Legislature in 1882.
After selling his property at the Prineville town site, Prine moved to Weston in northeastern Oregon. He became Weston's city marshal and later opened a blacksmith shop there. While visiting Boise, Idaho in 1876, Prine became a local hero by rescuing a young girl from a wagon being dragged by a team of runaway horses. Riding up next to the out-of-control wagon, he pulled the girl to safety just before the wagon crashed into a tree.
Later life and legacy.
In the mid-1890s, Prine began prospecting for gold in unsettled parts of eastern Oregon. He was particularly interested in finding the Lost Blue Bucket Mine, which he believed was located somewhere between the Owyhee River and the headwaters of the Crooked River. He later explored the mining country of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, and southern parts of British Columbia.
Eventually, Prine settled in the small community of Lapwai in the Idaho Panhandle. Once again, he opened a blacksmith shop. He ran that business successfully for the next 20 years. Prine died in Lapwai on 17 March 1919.
Today, Prine is considered the founder of Prineville, Oregon. The city is still the county seat of Crook County.

Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+

The Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ was a Mercedes-Benz Formula One racing car designed and developed under the direction of James Allison, Aldo Costa, Mark Ellis, John Owen, Loïc Serra, Mike Elliott, Jarrod Murphy and Eric Blandin to compete during the 2018 Formula One World Championship.The car was driven by four-time World Drivers' Champion Lewis Hamilton, and Valtteri Bottas, both of whom remained with the team for a sixth and a second season, respectively.
The car was the successor of the Mercedes AMG F1 W08 EQ Power+, continuing the approach with increasing the exposure of Mercedes' electric road car models, whilst AMG was included to reflect the relationship between Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Benz. The chassis also continued its numbering as F1 W09 to represent the ninth Formula One car that Mercedes had constructed since 2010. The car made its competitive début at the 2018 Australian Grand Prix, the opening round of the 2018 season. After participating in 21 rounds of Grand Prix racing, the car made its final competition appearance at the season finale race – the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, before retirement.
The F1 W09 EQ Power+ took eleven wins (all for Hamilton), thirteen pole positions (eleven for Hamilton and two for Bottas), ten fastest laps (three for Hamilton and seven for Bottas), eight front row lockouts and four 1–2 finishes. Hamilton clinched his fifth World Drivers' Championship at the , the 19th race of the season with two races to spare. The team clinched their fifth consecutive World Constructors' Championship at the , the 20th race of the season with one race to spare. Mercedes became only the second team in the history of F1 to achieve the feat of winning the World Drivers' Championship and the World Constructors' Championship five times in a row - an accomplishment previously only achieved by Scuderia Ferrari between 2000 and 2004.
Design and development.
The philosophy of the Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ continued from its predecessor, having an identical wheelbase of , making it as one of the longest wheelbase cars in 2018. However, Mercedes pushed its development in the direction of higher rake, up from 0.9 degrees to 1.2 degrees. Although the car has a rake of 1.2 degrees, this is still a significantly shallower angle than used on either Ferrari SF71H (1.5 degrees) or Red Bull Racing RB14 (1.9 degrees). The Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ was seen as competitive as the Ferrari SF71H in the 2018 Formula One World Championship.
A string of developments was introduced right from the start of the season, by having a long titanium extension from the rear wheel hub to meet up with the outboard end of the upper wishbone, raising its height well above the top of the wheel hub. This gives the airflow travelling from the side-pods to the critical gap between the rear tireson and diffuser a much clearer path than a conventional system. Reducing the angle of the wishbone from inboard to outboard will reduce the roll center height of the rear suspension, gaining a better center of gravity and center of pressure.
At the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Mercedes trialled a spoon-shaped central section with distinctive vortex-generating serrations on the trailing edge of the main profile. The spoon-shaped central section reduces the section of wing towards the outboard ends which will reduce the amount of drag and down-force, however gaining straight line speed when opening the drag reduction system. The jagged serrations which are bonded to the wing underside, will energize the airflow, trying to claw back some of the down-force lost to the narrower outboard ends.
In order to solve the car weakness in tires temperature, a revised front suspension and steering assembly was used, having conventional rockers, torsion bars, inertial central damper and an offset extra rockers. This invention improves better set-up flexibility and causing lesser aerodynamic disruption. Major aerodynamics changes were introduced at the 2018 Austrian Grand Prix, with radiator inlets being slimmed down, and the barge-board around the sides-pods changed significantly to increase the speed of the external airflow down the side and the underfloor of the car, creating more down-force. New rear wing end-plates was also seen to develop across the season, giving the rear of the car a more significant balance and grip.
Mercedes introduced a concave rear brake drum at the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, in combination with the unique rear wheel rim design developed at 2018 Belgian Grand Prix. The innovative design was to reduce rear tyre temperatures from getting too high, allowing temperature closer to the optimum threshold, by gradually building up the rear tyres' core temperature while not overheating its surface. The concave design of the carbon fibre aero-drum around the disc creates an air pressure difference around the wheel rim which causes the hot air to be extracted even faster.
Engine.
In addition to developing the AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ chassis, Mercedes unveiled plans to completely redesign their power unit for the 2018 championship to ensure continuous development until the next generation of engine scheduled for début in 2021. The engine was the subject of attention for an engine mode nicknamed "party mode", which delivered a performance boost over one lap and was used by the team in qualifying. The first specification was introduced at the opening round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship season and was used for 7 consecutive races, from Australia to Canada.
A second specification was due to be introduced at the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, however reliability issues prompted Mercedes to introduce at the 2018 French Grand Prix, naming it as a Phase 2.1 power unit. The third specification was then introduced at the opening round of the 2nd half of the 2018 Formula One World Championship season, the Belgian Grand Prix. For the 1st time in the turbo-hybrid era starting from 2014, Mercedes-AMG F1 M09 EQ Power+ power unit was down on straight line power across the season as compared to the Ferrari 062 EVO power unit used for Ferrari SF71H.
Launch, pre-season and in-season testings.
The Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+ was unofficially unveiled at the Silverstone Circuit with Hamilton and Bottas completing an inaugural shakedown on 22 February 2018. The car took part the pre-season testing at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on February 26–March 1 and March 6–9. During the eight testing days, the car completed 1040 laps; a total of , equivalent to over 15 race distances. The car was also driven by 2018 FIA Formula 2 driver George Russell during in-season testings at Hungaroring, where he set the then-outright lap record of the circuit at a time of 1:15.575.
Season summary.
Opening rounds.
Lewis Hamilton secured his 73rd pole position by breaking the outright lap record again at the with a time of 1m 21.164s, 1 second faster than his 2017 Australian Grand Prix pole position time. Valtteri Bottas crashed out during Qualifying 3 and had to change his gearbox, for which he incurred a five-place grid penalty and thus qualified in fifteenth position. During the race, Mercedes opted for an early pit-stop for Hamilton on lap 19 to cover off Kimi Räikkönen. However, both Haas cars - Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean - suffered retirements due to cross-threaded wheel-nuts being fitted loosely which resulted in an unsafe release into the race track. In an order to retrieve the Romain Grosjean car without compromising the race, race director Charlie Whiting and the stewards decided to call for a Virtual Safety Car (VSC) period.
Sebastian Vettel seized the opportunity by pitting during the VSC period, emerging ahead of Hamilton and Räikkönen. Sebastian Vettel eventually took the win of the race, earning 25 drivers championship points, while Lewis Hamilton earned 18 drivers championship points. Valtteri Bottas could only emerged 8th after recovering from his gearbox penalty. After the 1st race of the season, Ferrari leads by 40 constructor championship points, with Mercedes a further 18 constructor championship points behind. Mercedes confirmed that a software glitch had cost Hamilton and Mercedes a victory which allowed championship rival Sebastian Vettel to capitalize in the season-opening race.
Mercedes were unable to match the outright pace in , where they could only secured the 2nd row of the grid, with Ferrari locking out the front-row. Moreover, Lewis Hamilton took a five place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change and started from ninth on the grid. During the race, Kimi Räikkönen's second pit-stop suffered an unsafe pit release, which promoted Hamilton to the podium, after a healthy recovery run from ninth on the grid. Valtteri Bottas were unable to challenge Sebastian Vettel; although Bottas got within the DRS range, he had to settle for the runner up spot. After the 2nd race of the season, Ferrari leads by 65 constructor championship points, with Mercedes a further 10 constructor championship points behind. Sebastian Vettel extends the drivers' championship lead to Lewis Hamilton by 17 points. The pit-stop incident prompted the FIA to investigate wheel-guns and pit-stop procedures after several unsafe releases.
Once again, Mercedes were unable to match the outright pace in , where they could only secured the 2nd row of the grid, with Ferrari locking out the front-row. During the start of the race, Valtteri Bottas seized the opportunity by overtaking Kimi Räikkönen in Turn 1, while Lewis Hamilton lost a place to Max Verstappen. However, during the first pit-stop, Valtteri Bottas seized the opportunity again by undercutting Sebastian Vettel, giving him the lead of the race. A critical turning point for the race happened on lap 30, where both Toro Rosso cars collided at the hairpin (Turn 14), which resulted in a safety car period. This time however, both Red Bull cars seized the opportunity by pitting for new soft tires. Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel could not take advantage of the safety car period as they had passed the pit-entry after the safety car was called into action.
Lewis Hamilton stayed out to preserve track position, although Mercedes had an opportunity to bring Hamilton in for a change of tires. After the safety car restart, both Red Bull cars were strong enough to challenge the Ferrari and Mercedes. Max Verstappen make a bold move to challenge Sebastian Vettel, resulting in both drivers spinning off the track with Vettel losing several positions, due to a damaged floor. Daniel Ricciardo took full advantage of his tires, overtaking Vettel, Hamilton and Bottas on track, giving him the 1st win of the season. After the 3rd race of the season, Mercedes overturned the lead in the Constructors' Championship by a single point to Ferrari. With Sebastian Vettel suffering a damaged floor towards the end of the race, Lewis Hamilton was able to cut Vettel's lead in the Drivers' Championship back to 9 points.
European and Canadian rounds.
For the 3rd consecutive race at the , Mercedes were unable to match the outright pace of the Ferrari SF71H, where Sebastian Vettel took pole position ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. During the race, all drivers got off the line from the standing start without incident. Further contact from Kimi Räikkönen, Esteban Ocon, Fernando Alonso, Sergey Sirotkin, Sergio Pérez and Kevin Magnussen on lap 1 caused a safety car period. On lap 23, Lewis Hamilton had to pit early due to flat spotting his tires after suffering a huge lock-up, whilst Sebastian Vettel stayed out until lap 31 for his mandatory pit-stop on soft tires, while Valtteri Bottas stayed out for a long stint on supersoft tires. A critical turning point for the race happened on lap 40, where both Red Bull cars collided at turn 1 after their individual pit-stop. Valtteri Bottas took full advantage of the 2nd safety car period by doing his mandatory pit-stop, while Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton also pitted for new tires.
As a result, Valtteri Bottas took the lead of race with Vettel and Hamilton right behind him. During the safety car restart on lap 47, Sebastian Vettel made an attempt to take back the lead of the race by slip-streaming Valtteri Bottas into turn 1. However, the attempt back-fired as Vettel suffering a huge lock-up, dropping him back to 5th place, behind Sergio Pérez. A dramatic finish on lap 49 before the chequered flag, where race leader Valtteri Bottas suffered a high speed right rear tyre puncture after running across a foreign object debris along the start-finish straight. This in-turn gifted the race lead to his teammate whilst Bottas had to retire from the lead of the race after significant rear floor damage. Lewis Hamilton then took the chequered flag, followed by Kimi Räikkönen and Sergio Pérez. After the 4th race of the season, Ferrari overturned the lead in the Constructors' Championship by 4 points to Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton took over the lead in the Drivers' Championship by 4 points.
Coming to the , Mercedes could challenge the outright pace of the Ferrari SF71H, which saw Lewis Hamilton take pole position by setting the outright lap record of 1m 16.173s, with team-mate Valtteri Bottas locking out the front-row for the first time in 2018. As the race got started, Romain Grosjean spun across the track in turn 3, creating a huge accident in lap 1 which eliminated Nico Hülkenberg and Pierre Gasly, bringing out a six-lap safety car period. After the safety car restart, both Mercedes cars had great race pace, and led the field a long way ahead of anyone for the entire race, leading home the first 1-2 of the season for Mercedes. Hamilton extended his championship lead to 17 points and Mercedes took back the lead in the Constructors' Championship, leading Ferrari by 27 points.
The showed once more that the unique track layout wasn't suitable for the Silver Arrows. However, the team was able to learn more about the tyre issues from the year before when they missed out on a podium finish. During qualifying, Ricciardo took a dominant pole position in front of Vettel. Hamilton secured the third spot while Bottas qualified in P5, behind Räikkönen. On Sunday, Ricciardo reported a loss of power on the 18th lap. It was later revealed that he suffered an MGU-K failure but his rivals were unable to pass him on the narrow street circuit. The first 6 finishers ended the race in their starting positions with Hamilton climbing onto the third step of the podium and Bottas finishing in 5th. Thus, Vettel reduced Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship to 14 points while Ferrari reduced their deficit to Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship to 22 points.
Opposite to previous years, Mercedes had problems in matching the pace of their competitors at the . During qualifying, Vettel took pole in front of Bottas while Hamilton - who many had tipped as favourite for pole - only managed to qualify 4th behind Verstappen on one of his favourite tracks. In a rather uneventful race (with the exception of a big crash on the first lap between Lance Stroll and Brendon Hartley), Vettel went on to take a win which was never in doubt. Bottas came home second in front of Verstappen. Meanwhile, Hamilton got overcut by Ricciardo during the race and consequently finished only in 5th position. Vettel regained the lead in the world driver's championship by a single point over Hamilton while Ferrari cut down the lead of Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship to 17 points.
Triple header rounds.
Lewis Hamilton took pole position at the , the first since the revival of the French Grand Prix after a ten-year absence. Lewis Hamilton's teammate Valtteri Bottas locked out the front-row for the second time of the season. At the start of the race, Lewis Hamilton avoided the chaos that unravelled behind him at the start, with Sebastian Vettel locking up and sliding into Valtteri Bottas, spinning the Finn's car and puncturing his tyre while breaking his own front wing. The Safety Car was called into action as Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon clashed into each other, with much debris scattered across the track. 
After the safety car restart, Hamilton comfortably retained the lead. Vettel and Bottas were on the charge after their collision, with the former handed a five-second time penalty for causing an avoidable collision. Hamilton eventually took the win of the French Grand Prix, ahead of Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen, whist Valtteri Bottas could only recover to seventh. After the 8th race of the season, Mercedes continued to extend the Constructors' Championship by 23 points, while Hamilton took over the lead in the Drivers' Championship by 14 points.
Having received major updates to the sidepods and rear end of the car, Mercedes dominated the practice sessions and qualifying of the Austrian Grand Prix, though major hydraulic issues and faulty strategy cost the team a likely one-two, ending in two DNFs instead.
Pre-summer break rounds.
Mercedes appeared to struggle for pace against Ferrari at the German Grand Prix, with both drivers not completing any running in the wet final practice session. During the second part of qualifying, disaster struck for Hamilton as power failure meant he had to pull off the road midlap. However, Bottas managed to qualify on the front row of the grid behind Sebastian Vettel. This meant that Lewis Hamilton would be starting the race from P14, his worst qualifying position since the 2017 Monaco Grand Prix. However, after Vettel retired from the race in damp conditions, Hamilton won the race with Bottas coming second. This result meant that Hamilton retook the lead of the championship from Vettel by 17 points, whilst Mercedes retook the lead of the constructors' championship from Ferrari by five points.
Hamilton took pole position at the Hungarian Grand Prix. At the difficult to overtake circuit, Hamilton pulled away for his sixth victory at the Hungaroring, while Bottas struggled with his strategy and was demoted down to fifth in the early stages from a starting position of second. In the latter stages of the race, he was caught by both the Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen, with Vettel forcing his way past at turn 1 and Räikkönen passing Bottas as well.
It was also at this time suspicions of Ferrari's 'trick' ERS system arose, with Mercedes claiming their power unit had now surpassed Mercedes' own. However, the FIA approved of Ferrari's software and electronics usage of said system, observed from additional sensors put in the red cars since the Monaco Grand Prix.
Second half of the season.
Ferrari struck back in the Belgian Grand Prix, with Vettel passing Hamilton from second at the start of the dry race, having conceded pole in the mixed conditions in qualifying. Mercedes actually arrived with a large update package, centered on a new power unit and a ribbed rear wheel rim, but Hamilton was unable to pass Vettel in the race and settled for second. Ferrari's straight-line advantage was apparent in the high-speed Monza, having cured their car's shortcomings in the previous year's Italian Grand Prix, and duly took a 1–2 in qualifying after Räikkönen received a tow from Vettel. In the race, Hamilton overtook Vettel and spun him around, before using DRS to keep Räikkönen in sight while saving his tires. A team strategy gave Hamilton a sizeable tire life advantage, giving him the opportunity to pass Räikkönen late in the race after the Ferrari driver was bottled behind the out-of-sync Bottas, overturning Ferrari's qualifying advantage. Bottas was later nudged and half-spun by a particularly aggressive defensive move from Verstappen, though he was able to complete the podium in third.
The later rounds saw an uptick in performance from Mercedes, cited as coming from a deeper understanding and optimization of their update package, as Ferrari got lost in its own. Hamilton broke the track record of the Marina Bay Street Circuit in the Singapore Grand Prix qualifying, in a circuit said to disadvantage the Mercedes and favor Ferrari. Vettel only managed to qualify third, where he would finish in the race as Hamilton won. Bottas failed to extract the same speed as his teammate, finishing a subdued fourth. 
In similar fashion, Mercedes dominated the following Russian and Japanese Grand Prix, with Bottas gifting a position to Hamilton (and the win) in the former after a particularly tough team order from Toto Wolff, and Hamilton dominating the latter. It was the first time the team managed to secure back-to-back 1-2s since the end of the 2016 season. Mercedes was revealed to be running blown holes from their rear wheels, believed to be for cooling purposes, though rumors had it was also for aerodynamic purposes. Fearing a protest and disqualification, Mercedes opted to close down these holes for the next three races, coinciding with a downturn in performance. Vettel spun while trying to overtake Verstappen at Suzuka, surrendering vital points in the championship.
Final rounds.
Hamilton and Mercedes uncharacteristically struggled in the United States Grand Prix after a cross-weight set-up mistake from the team after a rushed build-up, though he still secured a podium to further improve his grip in the championship after Vettel recovered from a spin to fourth. Hamilton secured the championship with a similarly subdued performance in Mexico, taking fourth after an engine failure for Daniel Ricciardo in front of him.
The Constructor's Championship was clinched by a victory in Brazil, though Hamilton struggled with power unit issues and Bottas with tire performance, rumored to be linked to the closing of the holes in the rear wheels, a fact Mercedes denied. Hamilton took an opportunistic victory after Verstappen, having passed the two Ferraris and Mercedes who qualified in front of him into the lead, collided with a lapped Esteban Ocon and spun, dropping him down to second. Ferrari surprisingly struggled in the race, having started on the supposedly superior strategy using the soft tires, compared to Mercedes' choice of supersofts.
Mercedes ended the season with a dominant qualifying performance and a victory from Hamilton in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which was bizarrely interrupted by rain in the middle of the race, despite ongoing concerns with Hamilton's power unit's state after taking damage in the Brazilian Grand Prix. Bottas struggled in the race, finishing fifth after Räikkönen retired with power unit failure, marking the first time a Mercedes driver had finished lower than fourth place in the Drivers' Championship since Nico Rosberg did so in .

2018 Volta ao Algarve

The 2018 Volta ao Algarve was a road cycling stage race that took place in the Algarve region of Portugal between 14 and 18 February 2018. It was the 44th edition of the Volta ao Algarve and was rated as a 2.HC event as part of the UCI Europe Tour.
Teams.
Twenty-five teams participated in the race: 13 UCI WorldTeams, 3 UCI Professional Continental teams and 9 UCI Continental teams, forming a field of 173 riders. Each team had a maximum of seven riders:
Classification leadership table.
In the 2018 Volta ao Algarve, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers at intermediate sprints and at the finish of mass-start stages, the leader received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2018 Volta ao Algarve, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.
Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 10 in a mass-start stage. For winning a stage, a rider earned 25 points, with 20 for second, 16 for third, 13 for fourth, 10 for fifth, 8 for sixth, 6 for seventh, 4 for eighth, 2 for ninth and 1 for tenth place. Points towards the classification could also be accrued at intermediate sprint points during each stage; these intermediate sprints also offered bonus seconds towards the general classification. There was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a blue jersey. In the mountains classification, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs.
The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided in the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1995 were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time.

Battle of Sudere

On 15 March 2012, MNLA rebels attacked a Ganda Izo militia base in Soudere, 35 kilometers east of Tessit. According to information provided to the Malian press, the fight lasted from 8am to 5pm. Amadou Diallo, the leader of the Ganda Izo militia, claims that the attack was carried out by the Tuareg rebel Akli Iknane of the Imghad tribe. He and his men were deserters from the Malian National Guard who had been sent to fight MNLA. 
Amadou Diallo says: "We heard of an attack by armed elements against people and their property in the area and went to look for them when suddenly we were fired on by the fugitives." For its part, the MNLA accuses militiamen of abuses against civilians including Ebang Imalane encampment and in a village near Ansongo where they claim that one man was executed and another kidnapped. According to some sources, the attackers reportedly lost two men and one of them was captured by Ganda Izo. Amadou Diallo, for his part says that the losses of the rebels are six killed, seven wounded, that admitted to the hospital of Gao, and a prisoner who was handed over to the regional authorities. 
Regarding his losses, Ganda Izo said two were wounded and one had been captured. According to the MNLA, the fighting resulted in one death and one wounded on their side against fifteen killed and one prisoner in the militia.

Traill Green

Dr. Traill Green M.D., LL.D (May 25, 1813 – April 29, 1897) was a medical doctor, scientist, and educator. Green was actively engaged with the early years of Lafayette College, serving at various times as a professor, trustee, and acting president. He was a civic leader in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he lived most of his life.
Early life.
Green was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1813 to Benjamin and Elizabeth Green, who instilled upon him an interest in nature and science. This led to Green pursuing education in medicine, attending the University of Pennsylvania medical program where he graduated in 1835.
Career.
Immediately following his graduation, Green was appointed to the Philadelphia dispensary where he worked for one year before opening up his own medical practice in Easton. Knowledgeable in the field of medicine, Green was asked in 1837 by the newly-formed Lafayette College if he would become the school's professor of chemistry, a role in which he taught for another four years. Following this stint with Lafayette, Green served on the chair of natural sciences at Marshall College from 1841 to 1848, where he pursued his interests in botany.
In 1848, Green returned to Easton where he resumed his medical practice and his relationship with Lafayette as a trustee to the school. In 1849 he was again named head of the department of chemistry, a position he held until his death in 1897. While at the school, Green worked alongside James Henry Coffin, an individual also interested in the sciences, and more specifically, meteorology. Green, who owned his own telescope, took it upon himself to incorporate meteorology into the curriculum at Lafayette, and in 1864 donated $15,000 towards the creation of a building which would be used to house this telescope. This building, colloquially known as the "Star Barn" on campus, was eventually moved to make way for a chapel, and later dismantled to make way for a new mining and metallurgical building on campus; its stones used to build a new gateway for the school, its monolithic telescope base as the cornerstone for the new gymnasium, and its inscribed stone tablet placed on the chapel where the observatory had originally stood.
Upon the donation of this astronomy building, Green asked then-president William Cassady Cattell that his name not be mentioned upon the laying of the cornerstone. Cattell honored this wish, yet loosely hinted at the building's donor in his dedication saying, "The donor was too modest to allow his name to be mentioned...whoever he was, his name would be green in the memories of all true lovers of Lafayette."
Green also took an active role in the town of Easton, acting as president of the board of the Easton Area School District, president of the Easton Cemetery Company, and director of the Easton Gas Company, among others. In medicine, he was a trustee of the Harrisburg Hospital, first president of the American Academy of Medicine, founding member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a presiding member for many Pennsylvania medical societies affiliated with the American Medical Association. He was also elected an Associate Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.
As one of his final roles in life, Green served as the acting president of Lafayette College from 1890 to 1891.
Personal life.
In 1844 Green married Harriet Moore, who he had met at one of his botany classes. Together they had three children.
In 1841 he received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from Rutgers University, and in 1866 received the honorary degree of Legum Doctor from Washington and Jefferson College. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1868.
He died on April 29, 1897 in his home town of Easton.
Botany and Botanical Collections.
Along with regularly teaching classes for "boys and girls" in botany, he also held classes specifically for adult women.
Specimens collected by Green are held by multiple North American herbaria, including the Putnam Museum herbarium, Bailey Hortorium Herbarium at Cornell University, the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, and Pennsylvania State University Herbarium. In Australasia, specimens are held by the National Herbarium of Victoria - Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

Evelyn Silvia

Evelyn Marie Silvia (February 8, 1948 – January 21, 2006) was an American mathematician specializing in functional analysis and particularly in starlike functions. She was a professor at the University of California, Davis, and as well as teaching mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels there, was active in the improvement of secondary-school mathematics education.
Education.
Silvia was born in Fall River, Massachusetts.
A seventh-grade mathematics teacher told her she was the best student he had ever seen, a moment that built her confidence in the subject and led her to become a mathematician.
She graduated from Southeastern Massachusetts University in 1969, with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Continuing her graduate education at Clark University, she earned a master's degree in 1973 and completed her Ph.D. in 1973. Her doctoral dissertation, "Classes Related to Alpha-Starlike Functions", was supervised by Herb Silverman.
Career.
Silvia joined the UC Davis faculty in 1973, and remained there until retiring and becoming a professor emeritus shortly before her death.
Beyond her work as a mathematics professor, Silvia worked as a volunteer teacher of mathematics in local elementary and secondary schools. In the 1970s, she directed a master's-level teaching program at UC Davis, and in the 1990s, she headed the Northern California Math Project, an effort to improve mathematics education throughout Northern California.
Recognition.
The UC Davis Academic Senate gave Silvia their Distinguished Teaching Award in 1990. In 2001, she was one of the winners of the Deborah and Franklin Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics, given by the Mathematical Association of America to recognize college or university teachers "who have been widely recognized as extraordinarily successful and whose teaching effectiveness has been shown to have had influence beyond their own institutions".

Algebraic representation

In mathematics, an algebraic representation of a group "G" on a "k"-algebra "A" is a linear representation formula_1 such that, for each "g" in "G", formula_2 is an algebra automorphism. Equipped with such a representation, the algebra "A" is then called a "G"-algebra.
For example, if "V" is a linear representation of a group "G", then the representation put on the tensor algebra formula_3 is an algebraic representation of "G".
If "A" is a commutative "G"-algebra, then formula_4 is an affine "G"-scheme.

Floristic Quality Assessment

Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is a tool used to assess an area's ecological integrity based on its plant species composition. Floristic Quality Assessment was originally developed in order to assess the likelihood that impacts to an area "would be irreversible or irretrievable...to make standard comparisons among various open land areas, to set conservation priorities, and to monitor site management or restoration efforts." The concept was developed by Gerould Wilhelm in the 1970s in a report on the natural lands of Kane County, Illinois. In 1979 Wilhelm and Floyd Swink codified this "scoring system" 
for the 22-county Chicago Region.
Coefficient of conservatism.
Each plant species in a region is assigned a coefficient of conservatism, also known as a C-value, ranging between 0 and 10. A plant species with a higher score (e.g. 10) has a "lower" tolerance to environmental degradation such as overgrazing or development and therefore is naturally restricted to undisturbed, remnant habitats. Non-native plants are either assigned a C-value of 0 or are excluded from assessments. In the Chicago Region, 84% of the native plant species have a C-value of 4 or greater. Plants with a C-value of 4 or greater rarely naturally move from a remnant area to surrounding degraded land. For example, the federally endangered "Dalea foliosa" has a C-value of 10.
C-values are assigned within specific ecological and geographic regions by botanical experts familiar with the species' autecology within the respective regions. , there were more than 50 different FQA databases ranging from the Gulf Coastal Plain to western Washington, though most databases represented regions in the eastern and central United States and Canada.
The mean C-value (formula_1) is calculated based on an inventory of plants. An area with a native mean C-value of 3.5 or higher likely has "sufficient floristic quality to be of at least marginal natural area quality." Remnant natural areas with mean C-values of 4.0 or greater are unmitigable.
Floristic Quality Index.
The Floristic Quality Index (FQI, or Rating Index according to Swink and Wilhelm) is calculated by multiplying the mean C value by the square root of the total number of species:
formula_2
For example, the FQI for Nelson Lake Marsh was 78 in 1994 and that for Russell R. Kirt Prairie was about 30 in 1999.

Hanoi Indoor Games Gymnasium or Mỹ Đình Indoor Athletics Arena () is an indoor arena in Hanoi, Vietnam. It has a capacity of 3,094 using permanent seating and temporary seating configuration. The arena is a part of Vietnam National Sporting Complex, situated north west of Mỹ Đình National Stadium and Mỹ Đình Aquatics Center. 
The venue was one of several projects built to commemorate the Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi. It officially opened on September 19, 2009 after 14 months of construction, in time for the 2009 Asian Indoor Games.
Design.
The competition field of the arena has an area of . To prepare for the 3rd Asian Indoor Games, the gymnasium was equipped with a 6-lane 200-meter oval track and a 60-meter straight track, supplied by Mondo. Without the tracks, the field could fit up to 6 tennis courts. The venue was designed to withstand earthquakes up to 5.9 Richter with a life span of 70 years. 
Usage.
After Asian Indoor Games, the tracks were removed and the venue has yet to host another indoor athletics tournament since then. Hanoi Indoor Games Gymnasium has been used mostly for tennis matches, several local sporting events, exhibitions, concerts and other entertainment events.

Ludovic de Polignac

Charles Ludovic Marie de Polignac (24 March 1828 – 13 January 1904) was a French soldier and explorer who spent much of his career in French Algeria. He is known for negotiating a treaty with the Tuareg people in 1862.
He dreamed of creating a huge French empire in north and central Africa with the support of the Tuaregs and Arabs, and came to believe that the Jews and Anglo-Saxons were conspiring against France.
Early years.
Charles Ludovic ("Louis") Marie de Polignac was born in London, England on 24 March 1828.
His parents were Jules de Polignac (1780–1847), Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1829 to 1830, and Mary Charlotte Parkyns (1792–1864).
His father left his widow comfortably off, but not wealthy.
His younger brother, Prince Edmond de Polignac, became a composer.
Polignac entered the École Polytechnique in 1851.
He later pursued a military career in Algeria.
In 1855 he was a sub-lieutenant in the 59th line regiment.
Polignac thought that France should obtain an empire in Africa that extended from Algeria to the Niger River, and thus become a world power that could rival Britain.
Ghadames treaty.
Polignac helped to negotiate the Ghadames treaty of 1862.
Ghadames is a mainly Berber town in northwest Libya near the borders with Algeria and Tunisia.
It was independent until 1830 when it became a dependency of Tunisia and then of the Turkish empire.
The Europeans noted its commercial importance.
The governor of Algeria, Marshal Aimable Pélissier, decided to send a mission to Ghadames to make an official treaty with the Kel Ajjer Tuaregs.
The political aspects were entrusted to Commander Hippolyte Mircher as chief and Captain de Polignac, both of whom were familiar with Algerian Moslems.
They were accompanied by the mining engineer Vatonne, the army doctor Hoffman and the military interpreter Isma'yl Bou Derba.
The mission left Tripoli in October 1862 and travelled south to the oasis of Ghadames.
There they met with Tuareg chiefs of the ruling Araghen tribe, and quickly agreed on a convention that supported friendly intercourse between the two nations, protection to the Tuareg in Algeria and to the French in Tuareg country, and trade between the Tuaregs and Algeria.
The treaty was signed on 29 November 1862.
After leaving Ghadames the mission travelled northwest past the Ghardaya well and through the Wadi Souf to the town of Biskra in Algeria.
Vatonne and Polignac surveyed the route of the expedition.
The report by Mircher and Polignac on the mission to the Tuaregs was published in 1863.
Based on the agreement with the Tuaregs the metropolitan French chambers of commerce gave support to the traders in Algiers to arrange a caravan to the Sudan, although it does not seem to have ever departed.
After revolts in 1864 the projected trade between the Tuaregs and Algeria failed to develop.
However, the mission had gained detailed information on the trade between Tripoli and the Sudan.
Mircher gave a detailed report on this trade from Tripoli via Ghadames to Timbuktu and the Hausa states.
Later career.
Polignac married Gabrielle Henriette Prinzessin von Croÿ (1835–1904) on 28 January 1874 at Dülmen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
They had no children.
The marriage was unhappy, and they separated when Polignac assumed the position of Chief of Military Affairs in Constantine.
After his retirement Polignac met the handsome, young and anti-semitic Marquis de Morès and came to believe that Morès could help create a French empire in north and central Africa that would compensate for the loss of Egypt to the British Jew, Benjamin Disraeli.
He explained to Morès that the chivalric Tuaregs could easily be convinced that Islam and Catholicism were similar faiths, and once they had become loyal to the French all the other African Arabs would join in a crusade to drive the British out of the Mediterranean.
Morès was convinced, and after studying the geography of Algeria for two years returned to France in mid-1895 in an unsuccessful attempt to raise funds.
Morès returned to Algeria in March 1896.
He made a speaking tour of Algerian towns with Polignac in which he denounced the Jews.
He said, "France is exploited to the profit on foreigners, above all, England with the connivance of the Jews.
Despite lack of money he decided to travel south the meet the Tuaregs, ignoring Polignac's warning that he should not go since he did not speak the language.
Morès set out south from Ghadames with five companions, and on 9 June 1896 was ambushed and killed by a Tuareg force.
Although Morès wanted the Tuareg to fight the Jews, his death was taken by the extreme right as evidence that the Tuareg were part of a huge conspiracy of Jews and Anglo-Saxons.
The "Dépêche algérien" blamed the Polignacs and the Duveyriers for the tragedy and said the Tuaregs should be chased into their hideouts and made to pay for the bloodshed.
Another Algerian newspaper said the Tuareg were like other "Semitic pirates, politicians and financiers" and should be outlawed.
In 1895 the Algerian Arab interpreter Djebari claimed that survivors from the Flatters expedition were still being held prisoner by the Tuaregs at the oasis of Taoua.
A committee of African experts was formed to examine these claims.
It included Colonel Ludovic de Polignac; Jean-Marie Bayol, former Lieutenant-Governor of Dahomey; the explorers Gaston Donnet, Bernard d'Attanoux and Ferdinand de Béhagle; and Paul Bourdarie, secretary-general of the Société africaine de France.
Ludovic de Polignac died on 13 January 1904 in Bouzaréah, a suburb of Algiers.

UAAP Season 81 basketball tournaments

The UAAP Season 81 basketball tournaments were the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) basketball tournaments for the 2018–19 school year.
Former NU Bulldogs athletic director Junel Baculi replaced Atty. Rebo Saguisag as commissioner for the season's basketball tournaments on August 28, 2018. Former Vietnam Basketball Association commissioner Tonichi Pujante was also appointed as assistant commissioner.
The senior men's and women's tournaments began on September 8, 2018 while the games of the juniors' division began on November 11.
The Ateneo Blue Eagles and the NU Lady Bulldogs successfully defended their championships this season. Ateneo finished first after the elimination round, followed by Adamson. UP, FEU and La Salle finished tied for third, with UP getting the #3 seed due to tiebreakers. FEU defeated La Salle in the playoff for the #4 seed, and were beaten by Ateneo in the semifinals. Adamson lost out in the semifinals again, losing to UP, who have never been in the semifinals since 1998. Qualifying to its first UAAP Finals since 1986, UP was swept by Ateneo in the latter's second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP title. Thirdy Ravena was named Finals MVP, after scoring a still-standing UAAP Finals record of 38 points in the title-clinching Game 2.
The NU Lady Bulldogs won all elimination round games, qualifying to the Finals outright. FEU emerged through the stepladder playoffs that also involved UST and Adamson as NU's Finals opponent, but were still swept by the Lady Bulldogs. NU won its fifth consecutive title, all unbeaten seasons, for a still-standing league record of 80–0 in the last five tournaments.
In the Juniors' Division, the NU Bullpups and the Ateneo Blue Eaglets finished the elimination round with the top two seeds. NU eliminated the Adamson Baby Falcons, the only team that defeated them in the eliminations, while Ateneo defeated FEU Baby Tamaraws. In the rematch of last year's finals, the Bullpups defeated the defending champions, by winning all two Finals games. The Bullpups won their fourth title since 2011.

Fourth–seed playoff.
The Tamaraws and the Green Archers last met in the fourth seed playoff in 2012 in which La Salle won. The winner faces Ateneo in the semifinals while the loser gets eliminated.
Prior to the game both teams were having ups and downs into this match-up, after losing their first four games in the second round FEU manage to win their last three games to salvage their season, while La Salle sitting as the #4 and #3 throughout the season lost their last two games that denied them a chance for the last twice-to-beat advantage and a slot in the semifinals. In the first quarter, the Tamaraws were leading already by seven points, 17–10, towards the end of that period but the Green Archers countered it with an 11–2 run to take the lead by two points, 21–19. An Axel Iñigo buzzer beater 3-point shot regained the lead for FEU as they took a single-point lead. In the second quarter, both teams exchanged blows but La Salle took matters the most to lead by two points at halftime, 38–36. In the third quarter, FEU pounced La Salle into a corner with a five-point lead but La Salle cut the deficit by three points, 54–51, heading into the final period. In the fourth quarter, the Tamaraws were trying to pull away while the Green Archers were trying to catch up. La Salle eventually crept up tying the game and regained the lead. FEU's Prince Orizu fouled out of the game as Barkley Eboña returned to the game despite suffering from cramps earlier. La Salle took advantage of it as they led by four points towards the last two minutes of the game. However, FEU went within striking distance going toe to toe against La Salle cutting the lead by a single basket. The Green Archers swung back the lead by four, 70–66. with less than a minute remaining in the game. In an inbound play, Jasper Parker passed the ball to Ken Tuffin and converted his jumper and cut La Salle's lead by two points with less than 40 seconds remaining. Off a timeout, La Salle inbounded a pass but turned the ball over as it paved the way for FEU to steal the game from them. After the timeout, FEU had the possession with Parker holding the ball as he found a wide open Arvin Tolentino who shot a three-pointer to take the lead for FEU, 71–70, with 3.1 seconds remaining. In La Salle's final possession, Aljun Melecio found an open Leonard Santillan to win the game for them but eventually he was blocked by three FEU defenders winning the Tamaraws the game. Arvin Tolentino, who had a season plagued with controversy, led the scoring for FEU with 15 points with three three-pointers made including the last shot that sealed the game for them, while Barkley Eboña, one of the unsung heroes for FEU, finished with a double-double of 12 points and 16 rebounds.
Bracket.
&lt;section begin="Men's bracket" /&gt;*Game went into overtime.&lt;section end="Men's bracket" /&gt;
Semifinals.
Ateneo and Adamson had the twice to beat advantage. Ateneo qualified for its fifth consecutive Final Four appearance, and the second consecutive year where they are the first seed. Adamson, the second seed, was in its third consecutive appearance, and improved on last year's third seed. Third seed UP qualified for its first Final Four appearance in 21 years, last appearing in the playoffs in 1997. FEU advanced to the Final Four in its sixth consecutive season, the longest active streak.
Ateneo vs. FEU.
Ateneo had the twice-to-beat advantage. Ateneo has faced FEU in the semifinals in three consecutive seasons where the Blue Eagles won the last two series.
Ateneo started off with all cylinders on fire highlighted by two consecutive dunks by Thirdy Ravena to start the game on an 8–0 start despite FEU finally converted their shots with two consecutive three-pointers to cut the deficit by four points. However, the Tamaraws never had a chance to catch up against the Blue Eagles as they were blown out by as many as 31 points towards the end of the 3rd quarter. Ateneo outscored FEU in every quarter except in the last period as they didn't needed to use their twice to beat advantage after going wire to wire in the past few seasons. They finally marched on to their third consecutive Finals appearance and twelfth overall in the Final Four era.
Adamson vs. UP.
Adamson had the twice-to-beat advantage. The Falcons and the Fighting Maroons were in their first playoff match-up against each other. The winner of the series would be the seventh team to qualify in the Finals in the Final Four era.
In the first game of the series, both teams exchanged leads in the 1st half with UP taking the 1st quarter while Adamson taking the 2nd to nudge by a point at halftime. But the Fighting Maroons outscored the Falcons in the 3rd quarter 26–14 to take an 11-point lead heading into the 4th quarter. Adamson refused to lose as they countered them with a 26-11 scoring run to lead by 4 but UP countered it back with a 6–0 run of their own to take a 71-69 heading into regulation. A costly foul by UP sends Sean Manganti to the free throw line as he converted both of his free throws. UP called a timeout with 3.7 seconds remaining in the game to strategize the play as Juan Gomez de Liaño from the inbound found an open Bright Akhuetie to seal the game for them as they forced a rubber match.
In the second game, the Fighting Maroons kept their guns ablaze as they led by ten points in the first quarter and nine points at half time. Their lead later ballooned already by 16 points, 60–44, but the Falcons countered it with their own scoring with a 23–4 run to take the lead at the end of the third quarter, 67–64. Both teams exchanged leads towards regulation as UP led by three points with less than ten seconds remaining, 78–75. Jerom Lastimosa shot a three-point shot to tie the game once again at 78-all with UP in ball possession. Paul Desiderio missed a shot as the game went into overtime. In the extra period Adamson took a six-point lead already, 84–78, with 2:39 remaining in overtime, but UP scored 6 straight points to tie once again at 84-all with 58.2 seconds remaining. Adamson's top gunner Jerrick Ahanmisi went down with cramps after a contested layup against Bright Akhuetie was waved off by the referee, instead calling it a foul on JD Tungcab on the floor. Ahanmisi missed the remainder of the game. Two free throws were awarded to Adamson because they were already in the penalty. Jonathan Espeleta came in to take the shots in place of Jerrick Ahanmisi but split his freethrows to lead by a point. A three-point shot by Paul Desiderio swang back the lead to UP 87–85 with forty seconds remaining but a foul by UP sent another Adamson player back into the free throw line and tied for one last time at 87-all. Desiderio's jumper over Sean Manganti however put UP back on top 89–87 with 6.6 seconds remaining with Adamson calling its last time out. The ball was given to Jerom Lastimosa to win the game but he missed a three-point shot that would give Adamson the victory, as UP won the game and entered the Finals for the first time since 1986.
Finals.
The best-of-three finals began on December 1. It would be the first Finals match-up between the two teams. This is the first time that UP has made it to the finals since 1986, while defending champions Ateneo were in its third consecutive Finals appearance.

Handmaids to Kitty Girls

"Handmaids to Kitty Girls" is the sixth episode of the third season of the American reality competition television series "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars", which aired on VH1 on March 1, 2018. The episode features the return of the previously eliminated contestants and a challenge in which the contestants must compose lyrics, choreograph and come up with a distinct character to perform as in a girl group performance. Adam Lambert and Emma Bunton served as guest judges, alongside regular panelists RuPaul, Michelle Visage, and Carson Kressley.
Episode.
In a skit parodying "The Handmaid's Tale", previous All-Stars winners Alaska and Chad Michaels bring the eliminated queens - Morgan McMichaels, Thorgy Thor, Chi Chi DeVayne, Milk, and Aja back on the runway in front of RuPaul, who tells them the time has come for their revenge.
In the Werk Room, the remaining contestants - BeBe Zahara Benet, Trixie Mattel, Shangela, Kennedy Davenport, and BenDeLaCreme - discuss the elimination of Aja by BeBe Zahara Benet. The next day, RuPaul informs the contestants that they must compose lyrics, choreograph a routine, and come up with a character for his new supergroup The Kitty Girls. He then reveals the eliminated queens will be competing in a group of their own to win their way back into the challenge. RuPaul announces that whichever queen wins the challenge will get to decide which of the remaining contestants will be eliminated and which previously eliminated queen will return. The two groups engage in vocal coaching with Adam Lambert and practice their routines.
While in the Werk Room, the eliminated queens discuss their qualms over their eliminations with the Top 5.
Runway.
RuPaul introduces guest Emma Bunton and the contestants perform their songs, the eliminated queens performing "Sitting on a Secret" and the Top 5 performing "Drag Up Your Life". Upon judgement, the Top 5 are deemed the winning group. BenDeLaCreme and Bebe Zahara Benet are given positive critiques and are deemed the top two, while Kennedy Davenport, Shangela and Trixie Mattel are put up for elimination.
BenDeLaCreme and Bebe Zahara Benet lip sync against each other to "Nobody's Supposed to Be Here (Hex Hector Dance Mix) by Deborah Cox. BenDeLaCreme is named the winner of the lip sync. BenDeLaCreme reveals that she has chosen Morgan McMichaels, whom she had previously eliminated in the first episode of the season, to rejoin the competition. She then announces that she has chosen to eliminate herself from the competition, writing in her own name on her revealed lipstick with Wite-Out.

Notes
Reception.
Oliver Sava of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode an 'A-' rating, writing that BenDeLaCreme's self-elimination "drops a bomb on this season that completely changes the competition moving forward." The self-elimination was named the most shocking moment on "RuPaul's Drag Race" in an article by "Billboard". Fans of the series gave BenDeLaCreme the nickname BenDeLaChrist in response to her actions in this episode. In an interview with "Entertainment Weekly", BenDeLaCreme revealed that she only decided to eliminate herself on that day and had borrowed the Wite-Out from fellow contestant Thorgy Thor.

Angermuseum

The Angermuseum, Erfurt's first municipal museum, was officially opened on 27 June 1886. It is housed in a building that used to house Erfurt's public weighing scales, where travelling mechants would bring their wares to be weighed for payment of the city's customs duties. The museum faces Anger square; "Anger" meaning a town common. Originally, only the gallery on the first floor was used for the museum.
The building was constructed from 1706–1711. It was designed by the architect Johann Maximilian von Welsch. It is a Franconian–influenced baroque building with St. Martin, the city's patron saint, in its gable triangle.
History.
The extensive collection of works by the painter Friedrich von Nerly was donated to the city of Erfurt in 1883 by his son, Friedrich Paul Nerly, with the obligation to found a museum for the presentation of the collection. Friedrich von Nerly had emigrated to Venice in 1835 and afterwards had painted exclusively aquarelles and drawings of the city. More than 700 of the works created in Italy are part of the collection of the Angermuseum. Initially, the collection focused – inspired by the works of Friedrich Nerly – on landscape painting, portraits and still lifes from the 18th to 20th centuries. It is a special feature of the Angermuseum that the citizens here were involved in the expansion of the museum and not the princes as in Weimar and Gotha. Here – above all – families like the 
 and the family are to be mentioned. Die „the honorary class of wealthy and educated citizens“ (in German: "Die Honoratiorenschicht aus Besitz– und Bildungsbürgern") determined the character and orientation of the museum for a long time.
In 1912 the later Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob took over the management of the museum, afterwards Walter Kaesbach. Kaesbach was supported in acquiring new artistic works by the Jewish shoe manufacturer Alfred Hess, who supported the purchase of numerous then current works by painters such as Lyonel Feininger, Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach, Gerhard Marcks, Max Pechstein and others and thus caused the Angermuseum's collection to become known as one of the greatest of German Expressionism. The museum experienced its heyday in the 1920s under the long-term director Herbert Kunze.
A famous example of the Expressionist collection at the time is the so-called "Heckelraum", which the artist Erich Heckel designed in 1922/24 with expressionist mural paintings under the motto "Stages of Life" (in German: „Lebensstufen“). They are the "only preserved monumental mural paintings of German Expressionism" (in German: "einzige erhaltene monumentale Wandmalereien des deutschen Expressionismus") and can still be seen on the ground floor of the museum.
Through the National Socialists and their definition of Degenerate Art many works of the museum's collection of modern art at the time were destroyed or removed. Some works were also lost during the escape of the Hess family from Germany. It is the ambition of the museum to restore this collection. In autumn 2017, Christian Rohlfs' oil painting "Weiden II" (in English: "Willows II"), which had originally been in the museum since 1918, was acquired for 68,500 euros.
In 1935 the library moved out of the Angermuseum, which now had the entire building at its disposal. From 1944 the museum was closed down, the works of art were moved out because of the aerial war and thus saved from bombs and artillery fire. In 1976/77 the building was extensively reconstructed.
On June 1, 2010, after five years of renovation work, the museum was reopened as an art museum of the state capital Thuringia with the special exhibition "Natalya Goncharova. Zwischen russischer Tradition und europäischer Moderne" (in English: "Between Russian Tradition and European Modernity" in cooperation with the "Stiftung Opelvillen Rüsselsheim" and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.
Today, the museum is supported by the Association of the "Freunde des Angermuseums" (in English: "Friends of the Angermuseum Association") and the "Verein für Kunst und Kunstgewerbe Erfurt" (in English: "The Association for Arts and Crafts Erfurt") and, in addition to the "Gemäldegalerie", possesses extensive graphic and handicraft material.

Tender Pervert

Tender Pervert is the third studio album by Scottish musician Momus, released in 1988 on Creation Records.
Background.
The album's working title was "The Homosexual", due to its homosexual themes (as seen in "The Homosexual", "Love on Ice", and "Bishonen"). Momus was dissuaded by Creation Records founder Alan McGee from naming it as such due to the presumption that Canadian distributor PolyGram would not release an album under that title. The album's frequent references to homosexuality were based on Momus' reaction to homophobic rhetoric in the British media surrounding the AIDS epidemic, suggesting that, "...if gay people are not only dying but being gagged by the government while dying, it's up to straight people to promote homosexuality in their place." The album was also influenced by the themes explored by Serge Gainsbourg in his 1984 album, "Love on the Beat", as well as Japanese pop culture and cultural figures such as Yukio Mishima.
Critical reception.
Reviews of the album tended to be positive. Steve Huey of AllMusic called "Tender Pervert" "the first great Momus album" in a retrospective review, noting that it was the first Momus album to incorporate his trademark use of irony in addition to the synth-pop that would serve as the basis for later albums. Len Brown of Britain's "NME" noted the album's "intelligent, cutting lyrics". Andy Hurt of "Sounds" praised "Tender Pervert" for its "uncomfortable strength and purity", praising Momus for his use of metaphor and autobiography on the album. Christopher Dawes of "Melody Maker" called Momus' work on "Tender Pervert" "bold", saying that its "warrior poetry rarely complicated with harmony".
Legacy.
The artwork for Primal Scream's tenth album "More Light", designed by Scottish artist Jim Lambie, references the cover design of "Tender Pervert" by Thomi Wroblewski, which depicts Momus in front of a floral background, raising his index fingers above his head as if to mimic horns. "I Was A Maoist Intellectual" is quoted in Patrik Sampler's novel "The Ocean Container".
"The Homosexual" was covered by Kirin J. Callinan on his 2019 album, "Return to Center".

The Chaudiere River is a tributary of the Normandin River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, into the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada.
The Chaudière River flows in the townships of Vimont, Mance, Mignault and Aigremont. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The route 167 (northwesterly) connecting Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec intersects the lower (i.e., southerly) section of the river Chaudière. The Canadian National Railway runs along this road. The forest road R0210 serves the upper part of the river that it cuts near the mouth of the head lake; it also serves the eastern part of this valley.
The surface of the Chaudière River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
The name "Rivière Chaudière" was made official on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, that is, at its creation.

Beautiful Death

Beautiful Death is the third full-length studio album by American rock band Slaves, released on February 16, 2018, by The Orchard and SBG Records. The album serves as a follow-up to the band's second studio album, "Routine Breathing" (2015) and is the group's first release since their departure from Artery Recordings. It was produced by Erik Ron and was recorded at Grey Area Studios in Los Angeles, California. This is the final studio album to feature founding member and lead vocalist Jonny Craig, who left the group in January 2019.
The album was supported by its lead single, "I'd Rather See Your Star Explode", which was released on January 20, 2017. The album produced four more singles, "True Colors", "Patience Is the Virtue", "I Know a Lot of Artists", and "The Pact". The band embarked on the Beautiful Death Tour in September and October 2017 in the United States.
As of February 21, 2018, the album has charted internationally in five countries on the iTunes Charts: the US (#5), Australia (#11), Canada (#22), Britain (#30) and Germany (#64).
Background.
Slaves released their second studio album, "Routine Breathing" (2015), and toured in support of the album for two years. In 2016, following the release of a music video for the song "Winter Everywhere", featuring Tilian Pearson, the video was taken down by their former label, Artery Recordings, which caused controversy between the band and label. "Our music belongs to us, and it belongs to our fans,” they wrote. “Not some dude in a suit collecting every cent we generate. We have worked HARD for everything we have and it's time to take a stand against CORRUPT bullshit labels like Artery and so many alike.” In March 2016, the band's guitarist Alex Lyman announced his departure from the group following their U.S. tour with Capture the Crown, Myka Relocate, Outline In Color, and Conquer Divide. Two weeks later, Slaves revealed they would break-up. Despite this, in May 2016, the band confirmed that they did not break-up and were reuniting with a new line-up.
On January 20, 2017, the band released the single "I'd Rather See Your Star Explode". Due to sexual allegations against frontman Jonny Craig, Artery Recordings decided to part ways with Slaves. The band announced that they had signed with The Orchard and SBG Records in early 2018.
Promotion.
"I'd Rather See Your Star Explode" was released as the debut single off the album on January 20, 2017. A music video for the song premiered on the same day.
The second single, "True Colors", was released on November 16, 2017, along with its lyric video.
The third single, "Patience Is the Virtue", was released on January 2, 2018. A fourth single, "I Know a Lot of Artists", was released on January 26. A music video for the song "The Pact" premiered on the day of the album's release on February 16, 2018.
Tour.
In support of the album, Slaves embarked on The Beautiful Death Tour, which took place from September 1 to October 1, 2017. Support for the tour included SECRETS.

Boris Korenblum

Boris Isaac Korenblum (Борис Исаакович Коренблюм, 12 August 1923, Odessa – 15 December 2011, Slingerlands, New York) was a Soviet-Israeli-American mathematician, specializing in mathematical analysis.
Boris Korenblum was a child prodigy in music, languages, and mathematics. He started as a violinist at the famous School of Stolyarsky in Odessa. After he won a young mathematicians competition, the family was given an apartment in Kiev, an extraordinary event. Boris was given a mentor, a local mathematics professor, who would peremptorily supervise his course of self study. To the great chagrin of his mother, Boris decided against pursuing a music career. In June 1941, when the war began, he volunteered, not yet having reached the draft age, for the Soviet Army. Because of his fluency in German, he served in a reconnaissance unit. Some of his tasks was going to the enemy lines to capture a prisoner for interrogation. He was also the one to interpret to his commanding officers when a prisoner was taken. Once, refusing to beat a prisoner who was talking already, he quarrelled with the superior officer, and was punished by being sent to a penal battalion. There, he served with, and made fast wartime friends with, some rough characters, many of whom were discharged from penal colonies "to wash with their blood the offences against the Motherland." He later told his family that this experience, together with the inevitable maturing during a bloody war, made a man out of a soft city boy with a doting Jewish mother. After some time, the need for competent interpreters saw him return to his unit, where he served with distinction to the end of the war. His awards, including an Order of the Red Banner, were taken from him when he emigrated to Israel in November 1973.
Coming home from the war, he passed all the exams for the undergraduate degree in mathematics in a few of months, and was admitted for graduate study at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine where he received in 1947 his Candidate of Sciences degree (PhD) under the direction of Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez. Korenblum received in 1956 his Russian Doctorate of Sciences (habilitation) from Moscow State University. He was dismissed from the Institute of Mathematics at the height of the anti-Semitic campaign (together with all other Jewish and also half-Jewish scientists) around 1952, and afterwards became a Professor of Mathematics at the Institute of Civil Engineering thanks to heroic efforts by Professor Yury Dmitrievich Sokolov (1896–1971). (In the political atmosphere of the time, Sokolov risked the loss of his own position.) Boris Korenblum worked there until his emigration to Israel.
From 1974 to 1977 Korenblum was a professor of mathematics at Tel Aviv University. In 1977 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He was a professor at the University at Albany, SUNY from 1977 until his retirement in 2009 as professor emeritus.
Korenblum's research dealt with classical harmonic analysis, functional analysis, Banach algebras, and complex analysis. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1978 in Helsinki. In November 2003 a conference was held in Barcelona to celebrate the occasion of his 80th birthday. He is survived by his wife, his children, and a granddaughter.

<doc id="56609722" url="?curid=56609722" title="Merley House, Wimborne">
Merley House, Wimborne

Merley House in Wimborne, Dorset, England, is a building of historical significance and is Grade I listed on the English Heritage Register. It was built in 1752 by the bibliophile Ralph Willett and remained in the Willett family until about 1875. For the next century it was the residence of many notable people. It is now a hotel.
Willett family.
Ralph Willett (1719–1795) bought the Merley Estate in 1751, and a year later started building the house, which was completed in 1760. He had inherited a large fortune at the age of 21, when his father died in 1740, and from then on he was able to gratify his taste for books and pictures. His new house was designed to accommodate his collections, but they became so large that he required more space. In 1772 he built two additional wings, that on the south-east being a library (adorned with designs in arabesques and frescoes) eighty-four feet long, twenty-three wide, and twenty-three high. He also owned a house in Dean Street Soho in London. 
He was a patron to several artists. Over several summers he invited the botanical artist Georg Ehret to visit him at Merley house. Here they took walks in the countryside, and Ehret made use of his extensive library. The famous artist George Romney was commissioned to paint four portraits of the Willett family during the 1780s. Three of these are shown.
In 1779, at the age of 60, he married Annabella Robinson, who was the same age. However, she died shortly after the marriage, and in 1786 he married Charlotte, daughter of Mr. Locke of Clerkenwell and widow of Samuel Strutt, who was aged 40. She had three children by her first marriage, but Ralph and Charlotte had no children, so his cousin’s child John Willett Adye (1745–1815), whom he had adopted from infancy, inherited his property when he died in 1795. 
John Willett Adye's father was Stephen Adye, and his mother was Clara Payne. He took the name Willett in 1795 when he inherited the estate, becoming John Willett Willet. He became a lawyer and then the Member of Parliament for New Romney. 
In 1780 he married Catherine Brouncker, who was the daughter of Henry Brounckner of St Kitts and Boveridge in Dorset. Her portrait by George Romney is shown. Her father died when she was only seven, but he left her a very large inheritance. Her mother remarried John Stanley (1740–1799), who was a British politician and owned a house in Cavendish Square London not far from the Willets' house in Dean Street. The couple had two sons and one daughter.
By 1813 John was in debt, so he decided to sell the large collection of books that were still in the house. The sale was held over 17 days (catalogue is shown here) and raised a large sum of money, enabling him to pay his creditors. He died in 1815, and Catherine moved to London and died in 1798.
The house was inherited by his eldest son, John Willett Willet (1784–1839). However, he had a mental disability, so the property was largely managed by his brother Henry Ralph Willett (1786–1857). It was during this time that the two wings that had been added in 1772 were demolished, as they were no longer needed to accommodate the books and paintings. In 1819 a sale notice appeared in the newspapers for "120,000 bricks, mathematical tiles, a large quantity of Portland stone, cornices pediments and plinths", which were "part of the mansion house at Merley lately taken down". 
John did not live at Merley House, and for most of the time it was rented. One of the notable residents during this time was William John Bethell, who was a captain in the 103rd Foot. He died at the house in 1831. He was a personal friend of His Royal Highness Prince William Frederick, 2nd Duke of Gloucester, and in October 1825 the prince came to stay at Merley House. His visit was widely publicised in the newspapers, and the mayor of Poole made special arrangements to celebrate the occasion.
John died in 1839, and Henry Ralph Willett inherited the property. He was educated at Oxford University and became a barrister. He lived in Merley House and collected coins and pictures. His coin collection was sold anonymously at Sotheby's in March 1827. He was particularly fond of the artist William Hogarth and bought many of his paintings. He did not marry, and when he died in 1857, his estate was inherited by his cousin Willett Lawrence Adye.
Willett Lawrence Adye (1818–1878) was born in 1818 in Greece. His father was Major James Pattison Adye. In 1856 he married Elizabeth Marian Ross, and after he inherited Merley House in the following year, they went to live there. The 1861 Census shows that they were at the house with three infant sons and ten servants. They later moved to Puckpool House on the Isle of Wight and rented Merley House to tenants. The most notable tenant was William Charles Wentworth, the famous Australian explorer, author, barrister and landowner, who died there 1872.
In 1875 Adye advertised the house for sale. It was described in the following terms:
The house was sold in about 1878 and was bought by the Wienholt family
Residents after 1880.
The Wienholt family who bought the house in 1878 consisted of a large number of siblings. It was the residence of two unmarried sisters, Mary and Ellen, with other family members coming to stay. They were all the children of John Birkett Wienholt (1773–1852), who had seven sons and three daughters. Four of the sons—Edward, Arnold, Daniel and Arthur—went to Australia and became wealthy pastoralists. Mary and Ellen seem to have made major renovations to Merley House, as a notice appeared in the newspapers in 1886, saying, "Deans Court has been taken for a year by the Misses Wienholt of Merley House whilst the latter residence is undergoing repair." Mary died in 1896, and in about 1903 Ellen moved to Poole. The house was sold to Ivor Bertie Guest.
Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne (1835–1914) lived in Canford House (now Canford School), which was his family’s ancestral home. He bought Merley House primarily as a rental property, with tenants often from the aristocracy. Between 1904 and 1907 Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton and his family were the residents of the house. They were followed by Baron George James Playfair, who remained there until about 1913. Theophilus Basil Percy Levett and his wife Lady Margaret Levett, daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury, were the next residents.
In 1914 Lord Wimborne died, and Lady Cornelia Wiborne took over his estates, including Merley House. It continued to be rented out for the next eight years, and then in 1922, when Canford House was sold to become a school, Lady Wimborne moved into Merley House.
Lady Cornelia Wimborne was born Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill in 1847. Her father was John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough. In 1868 she married Ivor Bertie Guest, the future Baron Wimborne. Her nephew was Winston Churchill. She died at Merley House in 1927, and the property was sold to Angus Hambro.
Angus Valdemar Hambro (1883–1957) was a politician and a notable amateur golfer. He was born in 1883 in Kent. His father was Sir Everard Alexander Hambro, who was a banker and philanthropist. He married twice. His second wife was Vanda Charlton. He had three children by his first wife and four by his second. He lived at Merley house until after World War II and then sold it in 1946. It was bought by the present owners in the 1960s and is now available for events.

Calochilus platychilus

Calochilus platychilus is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales. It was first formally described in 2008 by David Jones and the description was published in "The Orchadian" from a specimen collected on Black Mountain in the A.C.T. The specific epithet ("platychilus") is derived from the Ancient Greek words "πλατύς (platús)" meaning “flat” and "cheilos" meaning "lip".

Chakkirako

Chakkirako (Japanese: チャッキラコ) is a dance performed at a festival in Miura, Japan, to celebrate the New Year and bring good fortune, especially in fishing. In 2009, it has been inscribed in UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. In 1976, Japan's government recognized this dance as an intangible cultural heritage to be protected.
The dance originated in the Edo period with influences by the dances of visiting sailors. By the mid-eighteenth century, it had become a showcase for local girls. Every year in the middle of January, ten to twenty girls in colorful kimonos between the ages of 5 and 12 perform the dance at a shrine or in front of houses. They are accompanied by five to ten older women singing "a capella".

Christian F. Uytendale Farmstead

The Christian F. Uytendale Farmstead is a historic farm in Benson Township, Minnesota, United States. The property was established as one of the first farms in Swift County, Minnesota, in 1868, by Norwegian immigrant Johannes Torgerson (1823–1909). In 1879 Torgerson sold it to "Captain" Christian F. Uytendale (1842–1912), a wealthy Danish immigrant who turned the farm into a prominent local landmark.
In 1887 Uytendale had a new farmhouse built with distinctive Danish architectural features.
The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. The historic district consists of the 1887 farmhouse, a granary built for Uytendale around 1900, and six early-20th-century outbuildings constructed by later owners. The farm was nominated for its status as one of Swift County's first farms, its association with one of the county's most famous turn-of-the-20th-century farmers, and its unique ethnically inspired farmhouse.

He has also authored a comic series entitled .
The book (lit. 'Alchemy: The Gold of Knowledge') is part of an Italian collection "Universale Electa/Gallimard", published by Electa/Gallimard in 1996 in their series. The French edition——published by Éditions Gallimard, came out in the same year, but Gallimard shortened the "Documents" section at the back of the book. The English edition, entitled "Alchemy: The Great Secret", is based on the French instead of the original Italian, was released in the United States in 2000, distributed by Harry N. Abrams in the "Abrams Discoveries" series. It is a pint-sized coffee table book, replete with colour plates, all well reproduced, with useful information in the captions. There are three chapters: I, "The Concept of Alchemy" (); II, "The Theory of Alchemy" (); III, "The Practice of Alchemy" (). These are followed by a section of five "Documents" (Italian edition has ten), which are excerpts taken from well-known texts on alchemy: 1, The earliest sources; 2, The medieval mystics and scientists; 3, The triumph of Hermetism in the Renaissance; 4, Alchemy in the modern era; 5, Alchemy in literature. There is a list of further reading, where is also included a number of English sources. The book closes with a list of illustrations and an index. It is the only work by Andrea Aromatico which has been translated into English, and other translations including Japanese, Polish, South Korean, Spanish and simplified Chinese, all of which are based on the French version.
The book opens with a series of reproductions of some elaborate images from , accompanied by texts taken from the "Emerald Tablet", the essential text of Hermetic philosophy, or alchemy, which was born of the oldest civilisations, and the transformation of metals has become one of the emblematic acts. But the search for "philosophers by means of fire" is not limited to the mere transmutation of lead into gold; it is indeed a philosophy, which most often takes the form of an "experimental metaphysics", and which has also given birth to a language—the Qabalah—and an extraordinary florilegium of and symbols. Aromatico explores in the book this compound of science and myth, examining ancient texts and illuminated manuscripts to shed light on an enigmatic science of spells, ceremonies, and secret beliefs.

A Legacy of Spies

A Legacy of Spies is a 2017 spy novel by John le Carré.
Background.
"A Legacy of Spies" is both a prequel and sequel to John le Carré's "The Spy Who Came In from the Cold". In that book, MI6 agent Alec Leamas, motivated by the death of his operative Karl Riemeck in East Berlin, agrees to undertake one final mission to get revenge on the man he believes to be Riemeck's murderer, a high-ranking member of the Stasi named Hans-Dieter Mundt.
In the course of Leamas's mission, which finds him unexpectedly extracted to East Berlin, he – along with his lover, a young Communist sympathiser named Liz Gold – is shot to death at the Berlin Wall, on orders of Mundt. The men responsible for dispatching Leamas – intelligence chief Control, Control's right-hand-man George Smiley, and Smiley's protégé Peter Guillam – escape unscathed, and it is revealed that Mundt was a double agent they were trying to protect all along, without telling Leamas.
Plot overview.
Now older and living in retirement on a farm in his native Brittany, Peter Guillam – who narrates the story in the first person – is summoned to MI6 headquarters to account for his actions during Operation Windfall, the espionage mission depicted in "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold". Learning that Alec Leamas's now adult son, Christoph, is suing the British government for the wrongful death of his father and Elizabeth Gold, Guillam ruminates on the course of events that led to the death of agent Karl Riemeck, and how Guillam and Leamas worked together to try and save not only Riemeck's life but the lives of several other East Germans working with him to provide intelligence information to Britain. The narrative also ties events from other novels featuring George Smiley and Guillam such as "Call for the Dead" and "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" into the backstory of "The Spy Who Came In from the Cold", and characters from those novels including Hans-Dieter Mundt, Bill Haydon, and Jim Prideaux make appearances.
The book alternates between Guillam's recollections of the events leading up to Leamas's demise and his attempts in the present day to stop feeling guilty for his role; his avoidance of Christoph, who wants to blackmail him; and his efforts to learn the whereabouts of Smiley, who has gone off the grid following his own retirement.
Themes.
In an interview with the National Public Radio series "Fresh Air" broadcast in the United States on 5 September 2017, le Carré told host Terry Gross that one of the reasons for writing the novel was "to make a case for Europe" in the wake of the 2016 British referendum, which resulted in a slim majority voting in favour of leaving the European Union. One conversation in the novel sounds like an emotional case for Remain and against Brexit: "'So was it all for England, then?' [Smiley] resumed. 'There was a time, of course there was. But "whose" England? Which England? England all alone, a citizen of nowhere? I'm a European, Peter."
Critical reception.
Writing in "The Guardian", reviewer Robert McCrum called the novel "poignant and brilliant". Despite some misgivings, "The New York Times" reviewer Dwight Garner described it as "simmering".

Yuba County Five

The Yuba County Five were all young men from Yuba City, California, United States, all with mild intellectual disabilities or psychiatric conditions, who attended a college basketball game at California State University, Chico on the night of February 24, 1978. Four of them—Bill Sterling, 29; Jack Huett, 24; Ted Weiher, 32; and Jack Madruga, 30—were later found dead; the fifth, Gary Mathias, 25, has never been found.
Several days after their initial disappearance, the group's Mercury Montego was found, abandoned, in a remote area of Plumas National Forest on a high mountain dirt road that was far out of their way back to Yuba City. However, investigators could not determine why the car was abandoned, as it was in good working order and could easily have been pushed out of the snowpack it was in. At that time, no trace of the men was found.
After the snow melted in June 1978, four of the men's bodies were found in and near a trailer camp used by backpackers as shelter deep in the forest, from the car. Only bones were left of the three bodies in the woods, a result of scavenging animals; but the one in the trailer, Ted Weiher, had apparently lived for as long as three months after the men were last seen, starving to death despite an ample supply of food and heating materials nearby. Weiher was missing his shoes, and investigators found Mathias' own shoes in the nearby woods, suggesting Mathias also survived for some time beyond the last night they were seen alive.
A witness later came forward, a local man who said he had spent the same night in his own car a short distance away from where the Montego was found after suffering a mild heart attack trying to push it out of the snow. This witness told police that he had seen and heard people around the car that night, and twice called for help, only for them to grow silent and turn off their flashlights. This, and the considerable distance from the car to where the bodies were found, has led to suspicions of foul play.
Background.
While he was stationed in West Germany as part of his United States Army service in the early 1970s, Gary Mathias, a native of Yuba City, California, had developed drug problems. These eventually led to him being diagnosed with schizophrenia and being psychiatrically discharged. Mathias returned to his parents' home in Yuba City and began treatment at a local mental hospital. While it had been difficult at first—he was nearly arrested for assault twice and often suffered psychotic episodes that landed him in a local Veterans Administration hospital—by 1978 Mathias was being treated on an outpatient basis with Stelazine and Cogentin and was considered by his physicians to be "one of our sterling success cases."
Mathias supplemented his Army disability pay by working in his stepfather's gardening business. Off the job, outside of his family, he was close friends with four other men, most slightly older than him, who either had slight intellectual disabilities (Sterling and Huett) or were informally considered "slow learners" (Weiher and Madruga, also an Army veteran) and who lived either in Yuba City or nearby Marysville. Like Mathias, each man lived with his parents, all of whom referred to them collectively as "the boys."
The five men's favorite leisure activity was sports. Their families said that when they got together, it was usually to play a game or to watch one. They played basketball together as the Gateway Gators, a team sponsored by a local program for the mentally handicapped.
On February 25, the Gators were due to play their first game in a weeklong tournament sponsored by the Special Olympics for which the winners would get a free week in Los Angeles. The five men had prepared the night before, some even laying out their uniforms and asking parents to wake them up on time. They decided to drive to Chico that night to cheer on the UC Davis basketball team in an away game against Chico State. Madruga, the only member of the group besides Mathias who had a driver's license, drove the group north to Chico in his turquoise and white 1969 Mercury Montego. The men wore only light coats against the cool temperatures in the upper Sacramento Valley at night that time of year.
Disappearance.
After the Davis team won the game, the group got back into Madruga's car and drove a short distance from the Chico State campus to Behr's Market in downtown Chico. There they bought snacks along with sodas and cartons of milk to drink. It was shortly before the store's 10 p.m. closing time; the clerk later remembered them because she resented that such a large group had come in and delayed her from starting the process of closing.
None of the men were seen alive again after that point. At their homes, some of the men's parents had stayed up to make sure they returned. When morning came and they had not, police were notified.
Investigation.
Police in Butte and Yuba counties began searching along the route the men took to Chico. They found no sign of them, but a few days later a Plumas National Forest ranger told investigators that he had seen the Montego parked along Oroville-Quincy Road in the forest on February 25. At the time he had not considered it significant, since many residents often drove up that road into the Sierra Nevada on winter weekends to go cross-country skiing on the extensive trail system, but after he read the missing persons bulletin he recognized the car and led the deputies to it on February 28.
Discovery of the car.
Inside the car was evidence suggesting the men had been inside it between when they were last seen and when it was abandoned. The wrappers and empty cartons and cans they had purchased in Chico were present, along with programs from the basketball game they had watched and a neatly folded road map of California. But the discovery of the car raised more questions than it answered.
The first was its location, from Chico, far off any direct route to Yuba City or Marysville. None of the men's families could speculate as to why they might have driven up a long and winding dirt road on a winter night deep into a high-elevation remote forest, without any extra clothing and on the night before a basketball game they had been talking excitedly about among themselves for several weeks. Madruga's parents said he did not like the cold weather and had never been up into the mountains. Sterling's father had once taken his son to the area near where the car was found for a fishing weekend, but the younger man had not enjoyed it and remained at home when his father took later trips there.
Similarly, police could not figure out why the men had abandoned the car. They had reached in elevation along the road, about where the snow line was at that time of year, just short of where the road was closed for the winter. The car had become stuck in some snow drifts, and there was evidence that the wheels had been spun attempting to get out of it. But, police noted, the snow was not so deep that five healthy young men would not have been able to push it out. The keys were not present, suggesting at first that the car had been abandoned because it might not have been functioning properly, with the intention of returning later with help. But when police hot-wired the car, it started immediately. The gas tank was a quarter full.
The questions continued after police towed the car back to the station for a more thorough examination. The Montego's undercarriage had no dents, gouges or even mud scrapes, not even on its low-hanging muffler, despite having been driven a long distance up a mountain road with many bumps and ruts. Either the driver had been very careful, or it was someone familiar with the road, a familiarity Madruga was not known to have. Nor, his family said, would Madruga have let someone else drive it. But the car also was unlocked and had a window rolled down when it was found, and they also said it was unlike him to leave the car so unsecured.
Efforts to search the vicinity were hampered by a severe snowstorm that day. Two days later, after searchers in Snowcats nearly got lost themselves, further efforts were called off due to the weather. No trace of the men was found other than the car.
Sightings.
In response to local media coverage of the case, police received reports of some or all of the men being sighted after they had left Chico, including some reports of them being seen elsewhere in California or the country. Most were easily dismissed, but two stood out.
Joseph Schons of Sacramento told police he inadvertently wound up spending the night of February 24–25 near where the Montego was found. He had driven up there, where he had a cabin, to check the snowpack in advance of a weekend ski trip with his family. At 5:30 p.m., about up the road, he, too, had gotten stuck in the snow. In the process of trying to free it, he realized he was beginning to experience the early symptoms of a heart attack and went back in, keeping the engine running to provide heat. 
Six hours later, lying in the car and experiencing severe pain, he saw headlights coming up behind him. Looking out, he saw a car parked behind him, headlights on, with a group of people around it, one of which seemed to him to be a woman holding a baby. He called to them for help, but they stopped talking and turned their headlights out. Later, he saw more lights from behind him, this time flashlights, that also went out when he called to them.
After that, Schons said at first, he recalled a pickup truck parking behind him briefly, and then continuing on down the road. Later, he clarified to police that he could not be sure of that, since at the time he was almost delirious from the pain he was in. After Schons' car ran out of gas in the early morning hours, his pain subsided enough for him to walk down the road to a lodge, where the manager drove him back home, passing the abandoned Montego at the point where he had recalled hearing the voices originate from. Doctors later confirmed he had indeed experienced a mild heart attack.
Weiher's mother said ignoring someone's pleas for help was not like her son, if indeed he had been present. She recalled how he and Sterling had helped someone they knew get to the hospital after overdosing on Valium.
The other notable report was from a woman who worked at a store in the small hamlet of Brownsville, from the spot where the car had been abandoned, which they could have reached had they continued down the road from where they left the car. On March 3, the woman, who saw fliers that had been distributed with the men's pictures and information about the $1,215 ($ in modern dollars) reward the families had put up, told deputies that four of them had stopped at the store in a red pickup truck, two days after the disappearance. The store owner corroborated her account.
The woman said she identified the men immediately as from out of the area due to their "big eyes and facial expressions." Two of the men, whom she identified as Huett and Sterling, were in the phone booth outside while the other two went inside. Police said she was "a credible witness" and they took her account seriously.
Additional detail came from the store owner. He told investigators that men whom he believed to be Weiher and Huett came in and bought burritos, chocolate milk and soft drinks. Weiher's brother told the "Los Angeles Times" that while driving to Brownsville in a different car in apparent ignorance of the basketball game seemed completely out of character for them, the owner's description of the two men's behavior seemed consistent with them, as Weiher would "eat anything he could get his hands on" and was often accompanied by Huett more than any of the other four. However, Huett's brother said Jack hated using telephones to the point that he would handle calls for his brother Jack from the other men in the group.
Discovery of bodies.
With the evidence not pointing to any clear conclusion about what happened the night the five men disappeared, police and the families were not ruling out the possibility that they had met with foul play. The eventual discovery of four of the five men's bodies seemed to suggest otherwise, but raised even more questions about what had happened that night, and whether at least one of them might have been rescued.
On June 4, with most of the higher-elevation snow melted, a group of motorcyclists went to a trailer maintained by the Forest Service at a campsite off the road about from where the Montego had been found. A front window of the trailer had been broken. When they opened the door they were overcome by the odor of what turned out to be a decaying body inside. It was later identified as Weiher's.
Searchers returned to Plumas, following the road between the trailer and the site of the Montego. The next day they found remains later identified as Madruga and Sterling, on opposite sides of the road from where the car had been. The former's body had been partially consumed by scavenging animals; only bones remained of the latter, scattered over a small area. Autopsies showed they had both died of hypothermia; deputies speculated that one may have succumbed to the desire for sleep that marks that condition's final stages, and the other refused to leave his side, eventually meeting the same fate.
Two days later, as part of one of the other search parties, Jack Huett's father found his son's backbone under a manzanita bush northeast of the trailer. His shoes and jeans nearby helped identify the body. The next day a deputy sheriff found a skull downhill from the bush, away, confirmed by dental records later to have been Huett's. His death, too, was attributed to hypothermia.
In an area to the northwest of the trailer, roughly a quarter-mile () from it, searchers found three Forest Service blankets and a rusted flashlight by the road. It could not be determined how long those items had been there. Since Mathias had presumably not taken his medication, pictures of him were distributed to mental institutions all over California; however, no trace of him has ever been found.
Evidence in trailer.
Weiher's body was on a bed with eight sheets wrapped around it, including the head. The autopsy showed that he had died of a combination of starvation and hypothermia. Weiher had lost nearly half his ; the growth of his beard suggested he had lived as long as thirteen weeks from when he had last shaved. His feet were badly frostbitten, almost gangrenous. On a table next to the bed were some of Weiher's personal effects, including his wallet (with cash), a nickel ring with "Ted" engraved on it, and a gold necklace he also wore. Also on the table was a gold watch, without its crystal, which Weiher's family said was not his, and a partially melted candle. He was wearing a velour shirt and lightweight pants, but his shoes could not be found.
Most puzzling to the investigators was how Weiher had come to his fate. No fire had been set in the trailer's fireplace, despite an ample supply of matches and paperback novels to use as kindling. Heavy forestry clothing which could have kept the men warm also remained where it had been stored. A dozen C-ration cans from a storage shed outside had been opened, and their contents consumed, but a locker in the same shed that held an even greater assortment of dehydrated foods, enough to keep all five men fed for a year if that had been necessary, had not even been opened. Similarly, another shed nearby held a butane tank with a valve that, had it been opened, would have fed the trailer's heating system. This behavior, however, was consistent with what Weiher's family members described as a lack of common sense arising from his mental disability; he often questioned why he should stop at a stop sign, and one night he needed to be dragged out of bed while his bedroom ceiling was burning in a house fire since he was worried about missing his job the next day if he left his bed.
It also seemed that Weiher had not been alone in the trailer, and that Mathias and possibly Huett had been there with him. Mathias's tennis sneakers were in the trailer, and the C-rations had been opened with a P-38 can opener, which only Mathias or Madruga would have been familiar with from their military service. Mathias, his feet perhaps also swollen from frostbite, could have decided to put Weiher's shoes on instead if he had ventured outside. The sheets all over Weiher's body also suggested that one of the others had been there with him, as his gangrenous feet would have been in too much pain for him to pull them over his body himself.
Theory.
Even knowing that four of the five men had died in the Sierra, investigators still could not completely explain what had led to those deaths. They still had found no explanation for why the men were there, although they learned that Mathias had friends in the small town of Forbestown and police believed it was possible that, in an attempt to visit them on the way back home, the men may have taken a wrong turn near Oroville that put them on the mountain road. For whatever reason the men had left the Montego; they had, instead of going back down the road (where they had passed the lodge that Schons later returned to), continued along the road in the direction they were originally going. Purposeful motion like that is not consistent with the circular patterns traveled by those who genuinely believe themselves lost.
The day before the men went missing, a Forest Service Snowcat had gone along the road in that direction to clear snow off the trailer roof so it would not collapse. It was possible, police believed, that the group had decided to follow the tracks it left, through snowdrifts high, to wherever they led, in the belief that shelter was not too far away. Madruga and Sterling probably succumbed to hypothermia midway along the long walk to the trailer.
It is assumed that once they found the trailer, the other three broke the window to enter. Since it was locked, they may have believed it was private property, and may have feared arrest for theft if they used anything else they found there. After Weiher died, or the others believed he had, they perhaps chose to attempt to return to civilization by different routes, overland, on foot.

IWI Tavor 7

The IWI Tavor 7 is an Israeli bullpup battle rifle chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge designed and produced by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI) as part of the Tavor rifle family. It is a fully ambidextrous rifle.
Design.
The Tavor 7 is in a bullpup configuration, the same as all the other rifles in the family. It uses a short-stroke gas piston system, unlike the two previous rifles, which utilized a long-stroke gas piston system, similar to the Galil and Kalashnikov rifles. This decreases recoil, as there is not as much mass cycling with each shot. The Tavor 7 also has a gas regulator with four positions: regular (R), adverse/extreme (A), suppressed/suppressor (S), and off/closed, intended for special operations. It has a hammer-forged, chrome-lined and free-floating barrel, with four RH grooves with a 1:12" right hand rifling twist. The Tavor 7 is fed by SR-25 pattern magazines.
The Tavor 7's external aesthetics are very similar to the original Tavor TAR-21, while the controls are similar to the Tavor X95. The magazine release and charging handle are in nearly identical places as the X95, and the bolt release is in the same place as the last two rifles. The selector switch is the same, except that the semi-auto selection is at a 45 degree angle instead of a 90 degree. The handguard is removable, and comes with integrated picatinny rails at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions, as well as M-LOK slots at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions for attaching compatible devices, including picatinny rail sections; it also comes with a removable rail cover to cover the 6 o'clock rail when not in use. The main receiver of the Tavor 7 comes with a picatinny rail across the top.
The ejection on the Tavor 7 can be reversed by pulling the brass deflector open to the opposite side of the port and then turning it 180 degrees, and then doing the same but closing it on the other side; the bolt then also needs to be rotated 180 degrees and the cam pin flipped to the opposite side (indicated by an R or an L). The non-reciprocating charging handle is reversible as well. The charging handle can also be held in the rear position similar to an HK MP5, as well as "slapped" down to release it.
Variants.
The Tavor 7 comes with the option of changing out the pistol grip with either the standard Tavor Talon trigger guard, a traditional trigger guard, or any compatible third-party accessory.
Tavor 7.
The Tavor 7 is the base variant of this rifle, with a 432 mm (17 in) long barrel, and 730 mm (28.7 in) overall length.
20" Barrel.
Most likely a designated marksman rifle variant, however yet to be separately designated, that is equipped with a 508 mm (20 in) barrel and has an 806 mm (31.7 in) overall length.
IWI US.
All Tavor 7s sold on the U.S. civilian market are semi-automatic only.
T7B16: A regular Tavor 7, but with a 16.5 in (419 mm) barrel and 26.75 in (679.5 mm) overall length.
IWI US sells their Tavor 7s in a variety of colors, including Black (B), Flat Dark Earth (FD), and OD Green (G); the letter "B" in the rifles' designations can be switched with any of the colors' respective letters.

Martha Doan

Martha Doan (June 6, 1872 - April 18, 1960) was an American chemist whose contributions include research in compounds of thallium, three published work, and tenure as a professor and dean at various institutions in the US. Throughout her lifetime she received four degrees, a B.S. and Master's from Purdue, a B.L. from Earlham College, and a Sc.D. from Cornell. She was a Dean of Women for two Colleges, Earlham College and Iowa Wesleyan College. In addition to her involvement in higher education, she was involved with several national organizations that involved chemistry and science. She was awarded a certificate for Outstanding Service to Science in 1951. There is now a garden dedicated to her in her hometown of Westfield, Indiana, in honor of her interests in science, nature, and horticulture.
Early life.
Born to Pheobe MacPherson and Abel Doan, Martha grew up in Westfield, Indiana. She was the oldest of seven children. Abel Doan was the president of the local bank, and the family was well known among the community. Martha graduated from Union High School, a Quaker school which was known for helping students develop into leaders in many different fields of study. After high school, Martha decided to pursue a college education. Her six younger siblings would also attend college.
Education and career.
Martha Doan would eventually hold 4 collegiate level degrees. She earned her B.S. at age 19, from Purdue University. Her next year of study would be directed at the pursuit of a B.L. from Earlham College in English Literature. Afterwards, she received an M.S. from Purdue.
Her final degree came from Cornell University. During her time at Cornell, she pursued a Doctorate of Science (Sc.D.) in chemistry. Her studies were funded by the Henry W. Sage Fellowship offered to select graduate students at Cornell. Her work towards this advanced chemistry degree revolved around the research of thallium and related compounds. In 1896, the year that she received her Sc.D., she was listed as a co-author for a paper regarding the thallium related compounds, that would be published by the American Chemical Society. She was the first woman to receive a doctoral degree in chemistry from Cornell.
Another publication of Martha Doan's is the "Index to Literature of Thallium 1861-1896." This index was unanimously recommended to the Smithsonian Institution by a committee from the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It would go on to appear in Miscellaneous Collections at the Smithsonian Institution in 1899. Her last publication was a translation of "Radio Indicators and other selected topics in Inorganic Chemistry."
In addition to being a published chemist, Martha Doan taught for a majority of her life. Her first job in teaching was at Manual Training High School, in Indianapolis. She was then quickly offered a position at Vassar College, where she taught as an instructor for 14 years. After teaching at Vassar College, she went on to be both a professor and Dean of Women at Earlham College. She stayed at Earlham until 1926. Three years later, she became a professor and Dean of Women for yet another College, Iowa Wesleyan College and held this position until 1937. There were several occasions where she served as an active or assistant dean of women during summer semesters at other institutions. During her deanship's, there were no indicators of difficulties, and she concerned herself with expanding the available educational opportunities. Her pursuits as an administrator included further developing strong teaching, research, and university extension work.
Recognition, honors and awards.
Throughout her career, Martha was highly involved in several organizations in the scientific and academic realm. After retirement she was an active member of the community. Her dedication to science and academia earned her several honors and awards from various institutions.

Dirty Computer

Dirty Computer is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Janelle Monáe, released on April 27, 2018, by Wondaland Arts Society, Bad Boy Records and Atlantic Records. It is the follow-up to her studio albums "The ArchAndroid" (2010) and "The Electric Lady" (2013) and her first album not to be a part of Cindi Mayweather's Metropolis narrative. A departure from the more psychedelic sound of her early work, "Dirty Computer" is a pop, funk, hip hop, R&amp;B, and neo soul record, featuring elements of electropop, space rock, pop rock, Minneapolis soul, trap, futurepop, new wave, synthpop, and Latin music. Four singles, "Make Me Feel", "Django Jane", "Pynk", and "I Like That", were chosen to promote the album. Its release was accompanied by a 46-minute narrative film project of the same name.
The album received universal critical acclaim upon release; it was included in the top three of seven publications' Best Album of 2018 lists, and received two nominations at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. It debuted at number six on the "Billboard" 200 and was further promoted by Monae's Dirty Computer Tour.
Background and recording.
In October 2016, Monáe made her feature-length film acting debut in "Moonlight", alongside Naomie Harris, André Holland, and Mahershala Ali. Monáe also starred in the film "Hidden Figures", alongside actresses Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer; the film was released in December 2016. While filming her two movie roles, Monáe remained active in music with features on Grimes' "Venus Fly" from her "Art Angels" album and also the soundtrack for the Netflix series "The Get Down" with a song titled, "Hum Along and Dance (Gotta Get Down)". She was also on the tracks "Isn't This the World" and "Jalapeño" for the "Hidden Figures" soundtrack. In an interview with "People", Monáe revealed that she was already working on her third studio album when she received the scripts for her two first acting roles; therefore, she put the album on hold. She also revealed in the interview that she would be releasing new music sometime in 2017, although by the end of the year no album or single was announced.
It was confirmed by Monáe after "Make Me Feel" was released that Prince, with whom she collaborated on her preceding album, had worked on the single, as well as the entire album, before his death in 2016. This was confirmed after listeners noticed similarities between the single's sound and the late musician's work. Monae stated in an interview with BBC Radio 1: "Prince was actually working on the album with me before he passed on to another frequency, and helped me come up with some sounds. And I really miss him, you know, it’s hard for me to talk about him. But I do miss him, and his spirit will never leave me." The synth groove in "Make Me Feel", reported to be written by Prince, was played at one of his parties years prior to its inclusion in the single, as confirmed by Prince's DJ, Lenka Paris.
Monáe had been exploring the themes presented in "Dirty Computer" for a decade before its production, but noted that "earlier it felt safer to package herself in metaphors...The sanitized android version felt more accepted — and more acceptable — than her true self. The public, she explained, doesn't really 'know Janelle Monáe, and I felt like I didn't really have to be her because they were fine with Cindi.'" Monáe considers "Dirty Computer" to be "a homage to women and the spectrum of sexual identities." The album's 14 tracks can be grouped into three loose categories: "Reckoning", "Celebration" and "Reclamation". The first deals with Monáe's recognition of how she is viewed by society, the middle explores her acceptance of "the cards she has been dealt", and the closing tracks deal with her reclamation and redefinition of American identity. Overall, the album is Monáe's attempt to "step into a more authentic self".
Release and promotion.
On February 16, 2018, Monáe revealed her third studio album and the accompanying narrative film, entitled "Dirty Computer", through a teaser video released on YouTube. The teaser video aired nationwide in select theaters prior to screenings of "Black Panther". Monáe held a series of "top-secret" listening sessions in Los Angeles and New York prior to the album announcement.
The album was released on April 27, 2018. It was supported with the simultaneous release of a 46-minute short film of the same name, dubbed an "emotion picture" by Monáe. It follows Monáe's character, Jane 57821, as she attempts to break free from the constraints of "a totalitarian society [that] forcibly makes Jane comply with its homophobic beliefs... In the film, Monáe's character is trying to assert her individuality, which makes her the enemy of a soulless regime – a common tension in dystopian sci-fi." Actress Tessa Thompson and actor Jayson Aaron co-star as Zen and Ché respectively, lovers with whom Jane escapes "the clutches of this repressive society." The film features little dialogue outside of the overlay of the album's songs that function as the narrative's main driving force. Tim Grierson of "Rolling Stone" described that, in the film, "Monáe plays with the conventions and totems of dystopian sci-fi to speak her truth and promote a cultural shift toward a more inclusive and loving society – no matter what repressive government (whether real or fictional) is trying to crush that spirit. Monáe is speaking to the present, but for her, the future is now."
On February 1, 2019, Monáe released a new director's cut of the "Dirty Computer" emotion picture with 13 extra minutes of bonus interviews from the cast and crew.
Singles.
On February 23, 2018, Monáe released "Make Me Feel" and "Django Jane", the first two singles from "Dirty Computer". On April 11, the album's third single "Pynk", featuring Canadian musician Grimes, was released. "I Like That" was released on April 23 as a promotional single, but soon after in August, was made to be the final official single from the album. Three remix singles were released for the song on August 17, August 24, and November 9, 2018.
Standalone music videos were also released for "Crazy, Classic, Life" and "Screwed" on December 12, 2018, and January 7, 2019, respectively.
Critical reception.
"Dirty Computer" received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 87 based on 33 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". At AnyDecentMusic?, which gives a formulated rating on a ten-point scale, the album has an aggregate score of 8.4 based on 32 reviews.
Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Andy Kellman said that "While this is easily the most loaded Monáe album in terms of guests, with Brian Wilson, Stevie Wonder, and Grimes among the contributors, there's no doubt that it's a Wondaland product. It demonstrates that artful resistance and pop music are not mutually exclusive." Neil McCormick for "The Daily Telegraph" called "Dirty Computer" "unblushingly and unsparingly direct...[It] establishes itself as a contender for album of the year, in more ways than one... [Monáe]'s layered sound is as contemporary as that of such digital trailblazers as Kendrick Lamar or Kanye West, yet it has an old-fashioned organic quality that comes from a bedrock of live musicianship. "Dirty Computer" sounds like 2018 distilled into a sci-fi funk pop extravaganza by a female Black Panther." "The Independent" reviewer Roisin O'Connor stated that "Dirty Computer" is "a record that will go down as a milestone not just as a work of art in its own right, but as the perfect celebration of queerness, female power, and self-worth." Danette Chavez of "The A.V. Club" described that, on "Dirty Computer", "the erstwhile 'Electric Lady' loses the metal and circuitry, but none of her power or artistry, cementing her status alongside Prince in the hall of hyper-talented, gender-fluid icons who love and promote blackness."
Josh Hurst for "Flood Magazine" wrote that "Every generation needs its own soundtrack for kicking against the pricks, and Monáe delivers one—easily the most pop-conversant, hook-laden, and propulsive music of her career." Robert Christgau, who in the past had found Monáe's voice too thin and her songwriting overly intellectual, was converted by "Dirty Computer"s Prince-inspired, sex-positive songs: "Too often prosex albums are shallow. While remaining intellectual, this one is more personal than the android dared."
In a less enthusiastic review, Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" suggested that "You occasionally wonder if an understandable desire to cross over commercially might not be at the root of the album's less inspired moments: there's something commonplace and risk-averse about the pop-R&amp;B backing of 'Crazy, Classic, Life' and 'I Got the Juice'... It's hard not to wonder if her failure to connect with a mass audience might be because her desire to work with concepts and characters, rather than unburden herself, suggests a certain aloofness... She is as elusive as ever, and her mystery remains intact. Without a true loosening of her poise, her position on the margins of pop could remain intact as well." Zachary Hoskins from "Slant Magazine" declared that "while the songs here are consistently hooky, they lack the earlier albums' sonic adventurousness... While Monáe's heart is in the right place, her lyrics occasionally suffer from the clumsiness endemic to politicized pop... If "Dirty Computer" feels somewhat blunter and less ambitious than Monáe's earlier work, though, it's also her most immediately satisfying."
Accolades.
The album was nominated for Album of the Year and the music video for "Pynk" was nominated for Best Music Video at the 61st Grammy Awards. The associated narrative film was a finalist for the 2019 Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation — Short Form.
Commercial performance.
"Dirty Computer" debuted at number six on the US "Billboard" 200, opening with 54,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 41,000 coming from pure sales.

Zanna Bukar Dipcharima

Zanna Bukar Suloma Dipcharima (1917 - 1969) was a Nigerian politician who was active during the Nigerian First Republic, he was a member of the House of Representatives and later appointed a Minister in the administration of Tafawa Balewa.

Career and politics.
Dipcharima began his career as a teacher, working at various schools from 1938 until 1946 when he embarked on a political career. He first joined the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), a party led by Dr Nnamdi Azikwe, and was in the party's delegation to Britain in 1947. Dipcharima left the NCNC to become a manager for John Holt. He re-entered politics in 1954 as a member of the Northern People's Congress (NPC) on whose platform he was elected to the Borno Native Authority.

Plot.
Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos visit the Isle of the Lost to choose four new villain kids (VKs) to take to Auradon. They pick Dizzy, granddaughter of Lady Tremaine, Celia, daughter of Dr. Facilier, and Squeaky and Squirmy, the twin sons of Mr. Smee. The day the kids are to be picked up, Mal is concerned about Uma being on the loose, and Ben, Mal's boyfriend and the king of Auradon, proposes to her, and she accepts. Ben's ex-girlfriend Audrey seethes with jealousy, and her grandmother Queen Leah admonishes her for failing to secure the family legacy by marrying Ben.
When the barrier is opened for the new VKs, Hades, the god of the underworld, attempts to escape, but Mal beats him back in her dragon form. That night, unable to contain her jealousy of Mal, Audrey steals the Queen's Crown and Maleficent's Scepter from The Museum. The theft and Hades' escape attempt has the citizens panicking. Mal, as future Queen, decides the best way to protect the subjects and restore peace is to close the barrier permanently, meaning no new VKs can come, nor can anyone enter the Isle. 
Audrey attacks Mal with Maleficent's scepter, turning her into an old hag. Mal and the other VKs go to the Isle to get Hades' ember, the only thing powerful enough to break the scepter's curse. Mal is restored upon entering the Isle due to the suppression of evil magic there. Celia gets Mal into Hades' lair, but he thwarts their effort to steal the ember. He is revealed to be Mal's absentee father and reluctantly gives her the ember, warning her that it mustn't get wet and will not exhibit its full powers for her. While leaving the Isle, Mal and the others are stopped by Uma, Gil, and Harry, who take the Ember. They agree to help after Mal agrees to release all the children from the Isle.
In Auradon, Audrey attacks Jane's birthday party with a sleeping curse; Chad aligns himself with Audrey, while Jane escapes into the Enchanted Lake. As the entire kingdom falls under Audrey's spell, she offers to reverse it if Ben will marry her; he refuses, so she turns him into a beast and begins turning people to stone. Mal and Uma, vying for the leadership of the VKs, return to Auradon with their friends. Despite their bickering, they defeat suits of armor animated by Audrey. Uma finds Audrey's diary and learns that she spends time at Fairy Cottage, a contribution for which Mal thanks her. Evie, nervous to define her feelings for Doug, wakes him with "true love's kiss." After finding Ben in beast form, Carlos calms him down until Jane restores him with lake water. As Mal and Uma are thawing towards each other, Audrey traps them in Evie's house; they reverse Audrey's spell by combining their magic, and they all reunite there.
At the Fairy Cottage, they find only a shell-shocked Chad. When Mal admits that she plans to seal off the Isle permanently, the group implodes and Celia, learning she can never see her father again, throws the ember in a birdbath, and Uma and Harry leave. After Evie tells Mal how upset she is for lying to her and their friends, they are all suddenly turned to stone, except for Mal. Audrey takes Celia hostage and attacks Mal, who turns into her dragon form. Realizing she is Mal's only hope, Uma combines their magic to reignite the ember; Mal overcomes Audrey, who falls comatose, and the curses are lifted. The ember could revive Audrey, but only in Hades' hands; Ben agrees to send for him, while Uma, Harry, Gil, and Celia plan to return to the Isle. Mal apologizes for lying; her friends and former rivals forgive her as they understood that she was just trying to do the right thing. Hades arrives and revives Audrey, but decries the double standard by which Audrey is immediately forgiven because she is not considered a villain. Mal and Ben apologize to Audrey; in response, Audrey apologizes to Mal.
Mal announces that she cannot be the Queen of Auradon unless she can also be the Queen of the Isle because everyone is capable of being good and bad and with Ben and the Fairy Godmother's agreement, Mal removes the barrier and creates a bridge, and the people of the newly merged society celebrate. Also, Jane and Carlos become official, Mal and Ben are engaged, and Audrey has eyes for Harry (after Uma rejects him).
In the mid-credits scene, Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos are seen looking at the Isle of the Lost; then racing across the bridge to their parents.

2018 Oaxaca earthquake

The 2018 Oaxaca earthquake occurred on February 16, 2018 at 17:39 local time (23:39 UTC) in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in Oaxaca state in Southern Mexico. It had a magnitude of 7.2 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of VII ("very strong") on the Mercalli intensity scale. The hypocenter was located at a depth of 24.6 km and approximately 37 km northeast of Pinotepa de Don Luis. There were only two reports of injuries from the earthquake, but later a military helicopter surveying the damage crashed and killed 14 people. There were also 15 people injured.
Tectonic summary.
Oaxaca lies on the destructive plate boundary where the Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the North American Plate. In the region of this earthquake, the Cocos Plate moves approximately northeastward at a rate of 60 mm/yr. The earthquake occurred as a result of thrust faulting at a shallow depth. The depth and focal mechanism solutions of the event are consistent with its occurrence on the subduction zone interface between these plates, approximately 90 km northeast of the Middle America Trench.
Historically, several significant earthquakes have occurred along the southern coast of Mexico. In 1932, a M 8.4 megathrust earthquake struck in the region of Jalisco, several hundred kilometers to the northwest of the Oaxaca event. On October 9, 1995, a M 8.0 earthquake struck in the Colima-Jalisco region, resulting in at least 49 fatalities and leaving 1,000 people homeless. The deadliest nearby earthquake occurred on September 19, 1985, in the Michoacán region 500 km to the northwest of the February 16th event. This M 8.0 earthquake resulted in at least 9,500 fatalities, injured about 30,000 people, and left 100,000 people homeless. In 2003, a M 7.6 earthquake in Colima, Mexico, resulted in 29 fatalities, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and left more than 10,000 people homeless. In March 2012, a M 7.4 earthquake 60 km to the northwest of the February 16, 2018 event killed 2 and injured 11 in the Oaxaca region. The hypocenter of the M 8.2 earthquake off the shore of Chiapas in September 2017 was located 440 km southwest of this earthquake. The Chiapas event caused at least 78 fatalities and 250 injuries in Oaxaca, and a further 16 deaths in Chiapas. Eleven days later, a M 7.1 earthquake struck closer to Mexico City, 230 km northeast of today’s earthquake, resulting in over 300 fatalities and significant damage in Mexico City and the surrounding region.
A second quake, registering 5.9, struck Oaxaca on February 19, 2018, around 12:57 AM local time. The quake, believed to be an aftershock, had an epicenter about 69 miles southwest of Oaxaca City; its impact was registered in Mexico City. No deaths were reported from this quake.
Helicopter crash.
Alejandro Murat Hinojosa, the Governor of Oaxaca, was in Tuxtepec at the time the earthquake struck and immediately left to survey the damage in Pinotepa Nacional with Alfonso Navarrete Prida, who had become the Secretary of the Interior the month before. The Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk military helicopter in which Murat and Navarrete, along with the state head of civil protection and one other person, were traveling, crashed in Santiago Jamiltepec while attempting to land nearby when the pilot lost control of the aircraft. The helicopter crashed on two cars that were parked in a field, where a family was spending the night outside after the earthquake. A total of 14 people, all of them on the ground, were killed, and 15 others were injured. All four people on board the helicopter survived unharmed.

The Caribbean Club Shield, also known as the CFU Club Shield, is an annual Caribbean football competition that are members of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU). It is a second-tier competition to the Caribbean Club Championship, and was introduced in 2018 for clubs from non-professional leagues which are working towards professional standards. It is currently run by CONCACAF and is officially known as the CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield.
The winner of this competition, as long as it fulfills the CONCACAF Regional Club Licensing criteria, will play against the fourth-placed team of the Caribbean Club Championship for a place in the CONCACAF League.
With the expansion of the CONCACAF Champions League starting from the 2023–24 edition, the 2022 edition of the Caribbean Club Shield will be the last held.

The Miracle Season

The Miracle Season is a 2018 American sports drama film directed by Sean McNamara and starring Erin Moriarty, Helen Hunt, William Hurt, and Danika Yarosh. The film is based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team after the sudden death of the team's heart and leader, Caroline Found, in 2011. It was released in the United States on April 6, 2018. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $10 million worldwide.
Plot.
Caroline "Line" Found is the star volleyball player on the Iowa City West High School Volleyball Team and well-loved by members of the community. With Line as the captain, the Trojans have been undefeated and everyone has high hopes for West to win the championship again after the previous year, especially against their long-time rival, City High. During a party at her house, Line decides to secretly sneak away to visit her mother Ellyn at the hospital, where she is being treated for cancer. That night, Line herself is killed in a moped accident, leaving the entire community in mourning. At Line's wake, Ellyn insists on walking to her daughter's casket to pay her respects; Ellyn dies from cancer days after the wake, leaving her husband and Line's father Ernie grieving with the loss of both his wife and his daughter.
Despite the school and community still in shock over Line's death, the Trojans' coach, Kathy Bresnahan continues to hold volleyball practice. She directly approaches Line's best friend, Kelley, encouraging her to return because Line would have wanted them to continue. Kelley refuses, but Bresnahan persists until Kelley agrees. After it is revealed that the Trojans lost their most recent match due to forfeit, Kelley encourages the entire school that they need to continue for Line's sake.
West High struggles in practice and loses their first game badly, still discouraged from Line's death. Bresnahan begins to run the team through grueling drills until a teammate can serve to spot one. When Kelley succeeds, Bresnahan names her the new captain of the team. As the weeks go by, the team begins to win and becomes motivated to win the state championship for Line. Bresnahan informs the team they need to win all of their remaining games to be eligible for the state championship. The Trojans win their next fourteen games, giving them a chance to win the championship.
Before the state tournament begins, Kelley finds a gift from Line's father, Ernie, that encourages her not to play for Line or to win for her, but to "Live Like Line." At the state tournament, the Trojans win the quarter-final game with ease, but struggle to win their semi-final game. They move on to the championship, and have to go up against City High, who are heavily favored to win. City takes the lead early in the match, but West manages to tie the score and force the fifth and final game. The Trojans go on to win and capture the state championship again. As the crowd cheers, "Sweet Caroline" plays in honor of Line and Kelley holds Line's picture up high and proud. 
During the closing credits, images, videos, and footage show the real life Caroline Found and her family, Kelley Fliehler, Kathy Bresnahan, and the Iowa West High volleyball team. On-screen subtitles reveal that Caroline Found's death inspired the Iowa West High volleyball team repeat their win for the 2011 Iowa State Championship. The Founds climbed Mount Monadnock for a year. Over 4,000 students from across Iowa attended Line's funeral. Kathy "Brez" Bresnahan was voted National Coach of the Year for 2011, and would later retire from coaching in 2014; she remains in contact with the 2011 team. Scott Sanders would replace Bresnahan as the West High volleyball team's coach, while Kelley Fliehler went on to study microbiology at Iowa State University. Ernie was given a white rose at senior night to honor Caroline Found. A bench in downtown Iowa City was painted in honor of Line and her mother Ellyn, and is the only bench in town that has never been painted over.
Cast.
The movie also had real-life former volleyball players as extras. Vanessa Wiebe and Cassandra Bagnell, who previously played for Thompson Rivers University and Dalhousie University respectively portray Twin Towers 1 &amp; 2, City High School volleyball teammates who rival West High.

Olivia Cesaretti and Brianna Solberg of Douglas College, Taeya Page of University of Calgary, as well as Samantha Patko of University of British Columbia portray additional West High Volleyball players. The film's director, Sean McNamara, makes a cameo as a Caroline Found fan, while Helen Hunt's real-life daughter, Makena Lei Gordon Carnahan, portrays a high schooler named Ruby.

Gun control in the Soviet Union

During the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government allowed a variety of small arms and bladed weapons. Afterwards, the government made immediate alternations for those to whom it did not rely. The government had made it a point to "arm the working people" in the Declaration of the Rights of Working and Exploited People in January 1918. The December decree of the CPC of 1918, "On the surrender of weapons", ordered people to surrender any firearms, swords, bayonets and bombs, regardless of the degree of serviceability. The penalty for not doing so was ten years' imprisonment. Members of the Communist Party were allowed to have a single weapon (a pistol or a rifle) and possession of the weapon was recorded in the party membership book. The assassination of Stalin's ally Sergey Kirov by Leonid Nikolaev in 1934 was possible because of this, as Nikolaev was allowed to have a revolver.
On December 12, 1924, the Central Executive Committee of the USSR promulgated its degree "On the procedure of production, trade, storage, use, keeping and carrying firearms, firearm ammunition, explosive projectiles and explosives", all weapons were classified and divided into categories. Now the weapons permitted for personal possession by ordinary citizens could only be smoothbore hunting shotguns. The other category of weapons were only possessed by those who were put on duty by the Soviet state; for all others, access to these weapons was restricted to within state-regulated shooting ranges. Illegal gun possession was severely punished. Since March 1933 the manufacture, possession, purchase, sale of firearms (except for smoothbore) hunting weapons without proper authorization was punishable by up to five years in prison. In 1935, the same penalty was imposed for possession of knives. During the Great Patriotic War, the civilian population had to hand over all the personal hunting weapons to the Red Army for defence against the German invasion. The same was true for weapons left by retreating German invaders in the war. They were to be surrendered to Red Army troops, the NKVD or local Soviet authorities within 24 hours. Cases of stolen weapons were also brought to criminal justice.
After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the USSR saw a small wave of liberalisations for civilian gun ownership. Soviet civilians were allowed to purchase smoothbore hunting shotguns again, even without mandatory submission of hunting licenses. However, this lasted for not more than six years. The buyer again had to pre-register in the Soviet Society of Hunters since 1959. With the introduction of the new Criminal Code in 1960, penalties were softened significantly for illegal possession of firearms to only up to two years of imprisonment, while the possession of melee weapons was no longer prohibited in the Soviet Union. 
Fourteen years later the punishment for illegal purchase, keeping and carrying of weapons was increased again to five years' imprisonment. However, voluntarily surrendered unregistered rifles were met without responsibility or punishment.

Solastalgia (album)

Solastalgia is the fifth studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, released on 27 April 2018. The album's title references an "existential distress caused by environmental change, such as mining or climate change".
The first single from the album, "Futon Couch", was released on 8 February 2018 with an accompanying video. The song has peaked at number 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart.
The album's second single "Cemetery" was released on 13 April 2018. The music video was released on 27 April 2018.
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, the album was nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album.
Reception.
Sophie Benjamin from "The Australian" said ""Solastalgia"'s best moments come from Higgins taking a long look at the world she's bringing her children into, wrestling with the guilt and fear from that decision, then going to her piano to work out her feelings about it." adding "The album's weakest moments are when Higgins mines her past for inspiration and gets carried away with the bells and whistles of laptop production." Benjamin concluded that "Old fans who loved her early work may be put off by the electronic production, but it's worth pushing through any discomfort and sitting with "Solastalgia", an album that only underscores her talent."
Liz Giuffre from "The Music" said "Although there's quite a bit of thematic doom and gloom on this record, expect plenty of highs, too", adding "A departure into the electro fringe, this is Missy Higgins as far away from organic/acoustic pop as she has ever ventured, and it's well worth the journey." Giuffre named the track "49 Candles" as the bold standout.
David from auspOp gave the album 4 out of 5, saying "Overall [Higgins] has created a collection of songs which are interesting, dynamic and lyrically intriguing." He also called the album "magical".

Futon Couch (song)

"Futon Couch" is a song performed by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, released in February 2018 as the lead single from her fifth studio album, "Solastalgia". 
Upon release, Higgins said: "This is the happiest song on the record. It is the story of me meeting my husband in Broome. He was my good friend’s house mate and one day he walked into the living room, wearing nothing but a towel, where I was waiting for my friend. I sat on the futon couch making small-talk with him while he did the dishes and I thought: 'where did THIS guy come from and why is he so lovely and how can I surreptitiously arrange to hang out with him more?' After that day, I popped round for tea at my friend’s house way more often. We fell in love. We sang 'I Was Made for Lovin' You' together at our friend's wedding the following week and a few years later, I walked down the aisle towards him. This single tracks the beginning of our relationship and follows it into an unknown future."
The song peaked at number 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart.
Video.
The video for "Futon Couch" was directed by Josh Harris and released on 28 February 2018.
Reception.
Thomas Bleach said: "'Futon Couch' is quite different to anything she has released in the past and hears her heading towards a heavier pop focus. With her alternative roots still holding on she transforms her sound with a slick indie-pop polish that will have you wanting to spin around, dance and maybe even run through a field. [...] The production is all euphoric which fittingly ties into the story while her vocals have never sounded so positive and bright before."

Plot.
Mauji Sharma is a small-town man who lives with his parents and wife Mamta. His late grandfather used to work as a tailor in the neighbourhood handicraft business. The trade eventually shut down, leaving Mauji's family on the verge of bankruptcy. His father Parasram now works as a government employee and is about to retire. Mauji is an errand boy in a shop that sells sewing machines, where he is constantly ridiculed and demeaned for the amusement of his boss. He secretly bemoans the fact that his interactions with Mamta are very limited owing to the lack of space, and her being perpetually busy with household duties. In spite of all this, he is a good-natured and optimistic person. He is also a skilled tailor, and often does small mending jobs on a sewing machine borrowed from his neighbour and friend Yogesh.
While attending the wedding of one of Mauji's employers, Mamta witnesses the kind of treatment her husband receives at work, which leaves her visibly upset. She urges him to revive the family trade, insisting that self-respect is more important than money. Mauji brushes this suggestion off, aware of the risks associated with it. Even so, her words play on his mind and he ends up resigning, much to Parasram's disapproval.
After Mauji's mother suffers from a heart attack, the family is thrown into deep waters as with Parasram now retired, they cannot afford the treatment. Mauji's younger brother Jugnu, who lives separately with his wife and son in the same locality, informs him of a clerical job in Meerut. Mauji declines it, and with his wife's support, sets up a roadside tailoring shop in the town market area. He stitches a hospital gown for his mother, which Mamta embroiders. The garment attracts the attention of other patients who also demand one, prompting the two to devise a new moneymaking scheme. Jealous of Mauji's success, Yogesh takes his sewing machine back. The couple journey across the state border to successfully obtain a sewing machine distributed to the underprivileged by the Government.
Mauji's activities in the hospital come to the notice of the authorities. Jugnu's brother-in-law Guddu, who is friendly with the staff, asks him and Mamta to manufacture the hospital gowns under the label of the clothing company he works at. He also offers them both jobs at the factory. After much deliberation, the two take the job, knowing that they are in dire need of the money. The owner of the company, Harleen Bedi, is a cunning woman who takes advantage of their gullible nature, resulting in them handing over the rights to their clothing and embroidery designs. Mauji becomes increasingly discontent at having been duped, and picks a fight with Guddu. He is thrashed and thrown out of the factory; Mamta quietly follows suit.
Utterly humiliated, the couple decide to enter themselves into the annual Raymond Fashion Fund competition for upcoming designers, which Harleen is also participating in. They name their company "Sui Dhaaga: Made in India". After their initial designs are shortlisted by the jury, they approach all the former artisans in the neighbourhood to help them out and participate in the final fashion show. Eventually, Parasram also comes around and lends a hand. On the day of the fashion show, their clothes are highly appreciated by everyone for their originality. Shortly before the results are announced, two of the judges let slip that while any other designer in their place would have easily won, their lack of experience worked against them. Crestfallen, the team make their way back to catch the bus home. Meanwhile, the judges re-evaluate their decision and declare Team "Sui Dhaaga" as the winners. Everyone is called back and as they all walk the ramp again, Mauji and Mamta are elated at having their dreams finally come true.
As the end credits roll, it is shown that the family is free from their financial struggles, "Sui Dhaaga"'s designs are being marketed all over the world, and Mauji and Mamta have opened up a tailoring school to encourage others like them to become self-reliant.
Production.
Development.
The project was announced in July 2017. After initial talks with Ranbir Kapoor fell through, Dhawan was approached for the lead role, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead. The duo posted riddles related to the theme of the film on their social media handles, and confirmed it soon after that. Sharat Katariya, who had earlier made the romantic comedy "Dum Laga Ke Haisha" (2015), wrote the script of "Sui Dhaaga" in 3 weeks and was roped in to direct the film, with Maneesh Sharma producing it under the Yash Raj Films banner. Anushka Sharma and Maneesh Sharma had previously worked on the latter's debut film "Band Baaja Baaraat" (2010) and "Ladies vs Ricky Bahl" (2011).
According to sources, the film was based on the Make in India campaign launched by the Indian government in 2014, which was aimed at promoting the country's indigenous textile industries. Maneesh Sharma called it "[..] a heartwarming story of pride and self-reliance." He further added, "This story finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian."
It was initially speculated that Dhawan would play the role of a labourer in the film. Later it was reported that he would play a tailor, and Anushka Sharma an embroiderer. Dhawan described his character to be both a tailor and a peon, and stated that it had been inspired by the "Tinkle" comic character Suppandi. Both the actors learnt how to sew and embroider, and also operate the sewing machine.

The actors bought traditional Chanderi sarees from local weavers in the town, praising the hard work that went into making them. Dhawan concurred a head injury whilst filming a fight sequence, but resumed work the very same day. The actors also shot for a continuous ten-hour cycling sequence in the streets of Chanderi. The first schedule wrapped up in March 2018.
Filming continued in the same month in Bhopal, and moved on to Delhi and Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The second schedule was completed in April 2018.
The final schedule of the film begun in June 2018. The shooting of the film was wrapped in July 2018.
Marketing and release.
Prior to beginning filming, a short clip paying tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, and featuring Anushka Sharma and Varun Dhawan was released on the occasion of his 150th birth anniversary. A still which depicted the lead pair as a small town couple was released shortly after filming had begun. During a Twitter interaction with fans, Dhawan announced that the trailer will be released in August 2018. On 13 August, Yash Raj Films released the trailer of the film on YouTube. Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma were seen promoting their movie in a new promotional activity called "Sui Dhaaga" "Challenge", where the actors are nominating colleagues to take up the challenge and share videos of themselves threading a needle on social media.
The film was released in Taiwan on 3 January 2020.

Juntos Haremos Historia

Juntos Haremos Historia () was a Mexican political coalition encompassing the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Labor Party (PT), and Social Encounter Party (PES), the latter of which was consequently absorbed into the National Regeneration Movement, to compete in the 2018 general election. Its current leader, as well as their presidential candidate, is Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who won the election.
The coalition was disbanded in 2020 and succeeded by the Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition, including the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico.
History.
"Juntos Haremos Historia" was registered with the National Electoral Institute on 15 December 2017, to compete in the general election. The parties will field joint candidates for the presidency, 292 of 300 district seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and all 64 candidacies to the Senate of the Republic. The coalition is structured such that MORENA holds a 50 percent vote and the other two parties 25 percent. A similar distribution is followed for the allocation of candidacies, including at the state level.
On 18 February 2018, at its national convention, MORENA unanimously selected López Obrador as its presidential candidate; the Labor Party and Social Encounter Party followed over the next two days.
However, on the 3rd of September, due to the fact that the Social Encounter Party failed to attract three percent of the vote in the elections for president, federal deputies, and senators, which under Mexican law prompts the loss of its federal registry and the appointment of a liquidator by the INE to dispose of the national party's assets, the PES and the New Alliance Party, both lost their registry after the 2018 elections, and after they challenged the results, to no avail, the party was dissolved.
State coalitions.
At the state level, "Juntos Haremos Historia" will compete as a similarly configured coalition in 27 of the 30 states holding simultaneous local elections in 2018. Among the states where the three parties did not enter into coalition was Hidalgo, where the state PES party is linked to former PRI Secretary of the Interior Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong. In the State of Mexico, a coalition agreement was signed but has caused dissent among PT party members for relegating the party in key municipalities.

Gaius Octavius Laenas

Gaius Octavius Laenas was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the second half of AD 33 as the colleague of Lucius Salvius Otho. Laenas was also "curator aquarum", or overseer of the aqueducts and water supply of Rome from the death of Marcus Cocceius Nerva from about the year 33 to the year 38.
Octavius Laenas is important for genealogical reasons, as Ronald Syme explains. He was the son of another Octavius Laenas, who is otherwise unattested, and Sergia "presumed a daughter of the patrician L. Sergius Plautus". Besides the future consul, the elder Laenas and Sergia also had a daughter, Sergia Plautilla, who married Marcus Cocceius Nerva; their children included the future emperor Nerva. The younger Laenas married Rubellia Bassa, the daughter of his maternal cousin Gaius Rubellius Blandus, suffect consul in 18. That Blandus was married, either before or after the birth of Rubellia, to Julia Livia, great-granddaughter of the emperor Tiberius, which aligned Laenas with the ruling Julio-Claudian dynasty.
Together Laenas and Rubellia Bassa are known to have at least one child, a surmised son, who was the grandfather of Sergius Octavius Laenas Pontianus, consul in 131.

His professional involvement includes the World Health Organisation (WHO) Human Reproduction Programme's Male Task Force, WHO Human Reproduction Programme, United Nations Fund for Population Activities, Endocrine Society of Australia, World Anti-Doping Agency’s Health, Medicine and Research Committee, and Australian Drug Evaluation Committee.
Education.
Handelsman obtained his MB BS from the University of Melbourne in 1974. In 1980 he became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (Endocrinology). Handlesman gained his PhD in Medicine from the University of Sydney in 1984 with a thesis titled: "Testicular function in uremia: clinical and experimental studies".
Career.
After holding positions as the National Health and Medical Research Council ( NHMRC) Neil Hamilton Fairley Overseas Fellow working at the Harbor‑UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles from 1984 to 1985 and the Wellcome Senior Research Fellow in the Departments of Medicine &amp; Obstetrics/Gynecology at the University of Sydney from 1987 to 1989, Handelsman was appointed Director, Andrology Unit, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney from 1985 to 1998. From 1989 to 1996 he was Associate Professor, Departments of Medicine, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, University of Sydney.
In 1995 Handelsman was Visiting Professor at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Munster, Germany.
Handelsman become Australia’s first Professor in Reproductive Endocrinology and Andrology (Personal Chair), University of Sydney. In 1999 he was founding Head of Australia's first hospital Andrology Department at Concord Hospital. He has been founding Director of the ANZAC Research Institute since 1998.
During his career, Handelsman has served the maximum two terms on WHO Human Reproduction Programme's Male Task Force from 1988 to 1994 and is "Ad hoc" adviser to the WHO Human Reproduction Programme and United Nations Fund for Population Activities. He chaired the Endocrine Society of Australia's Writing Committee which created the first Australian national guidelines that are independent of the pharmaceutical industry. These guidelines are currently endorsed as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) guidelines for the prescription of androgen.
Handelsman has authored more than 300 scientific papers, supervised 17 PhD students, and 10 other graduate students with funding from peer-reviewed grants (National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and other national and international agencies) and industry contracts.He has been a peer reviewer for over 70 scientific journals and a member of the editorial board of twelve journals. He was a Member of the Scientific Committee for both the first (1990) and second (1995) International Androgen Workshop supported by WHO, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the CONRAD organisation.
Handelsman is a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Health, Medicine and Research Committee which monitors scientific developments in sport aiming to safeguard doping-free sport practice. From 1994 to 1998 he served as an Associate Member on the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee and was Principal Investigator in the proof-of-principle study that established the androgen-progestin combination as the most effective form of hormonal male contraception.
Essendon Football Club Doping Scandal.
From February 2013 until late 2016, the Essendon Football Club, a professional Australian Rules Football club playing in the Australian Football League (AFL), was investigated by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) over the legality of its supplements program during the 2012 AFL season and the preceding preseason. The various investigations received a extensive media coverage. Handelsman acted as ASADA's expert witness during the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal.
The testosterone investigations and the Healthy Man study.
In 2013 Handelsman published the first multinational survey of temporal trends in testosterone prescribing in response to anecdotal evidence of increased use of testosterone. The survey showed that off-label testosterone prescribing had increased because clinical guidelines endorsed testosterone prescribing for age-related functional androgen deficiency. This raised concerns because " [b]y eliminating the fundamental distinction between pathological and functional androgen deficiency, these guidelines tacitly promote increased testosterone prescribing, bypassing the requirement for high-quality clinical evidence of safety and efficacy and creating dramatic increases in prescription of testosterone products."
Continuing his research, with colleagues at the ANZAC Research Centre, Handelsman carried out the Healthy Man Study. Through analysis of over 300 very healthy ageing men it was found that drops in testosterone is more related to poor diet, obesity or smoking than ageing and that the excitement about so-called manopause is “a re-emergence of the rejuvenation fantasies that recur whenever society can afford such indulgences as believing that ageing can be somehow avoided.”

Peace, Nonviolence and Empowerment - Gandhian Philosophy in the 21st Century was a conference held in New Delhi January 29–30, 2007. The conference was held to commemorate the centenary of Mohandas Gandhi's satyagraha movement. It was organized by the Indian National Congress. 122 organizations from 90 countries participated in the conference. A number of Nobel Prize laureates attended the event, including Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa and Professor Mohammed Yunus. Nelson Mandela addressed the meeting via satellite link.
Congress President Sonia Gandhi attended all four panel sessions of the conference. The conference appealed to the United Nations to declare Gandhi's birthday (October 2) as the International Day of Non-Violence. Subsequently, on June 15, 2007 the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted October 2 as International Day of Non-Violence, a motion tabled by the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma. The conference appealed to create an international civil society forum to institutionalize Gandhian approach of non-violence.
Domestically, the conference received criticism for being used to promote the political ascendancy of Rahul Gandhi. However, Rahul Gandhi held a fairly low profile at the event.
Participants.

Career.
Merrick, performing out of Toronto under the stage name HDV, released his first album "Sex, Drugs + Violence" through Canadian independent record label ISBA Records. The album spawned his best known Canadian single "Pimp of the Microphone". That same year he also performed as a member of the Canadian hip-hop and dance music supergroup Dance Appeal. The group was formed to protest CRTC decision 90-693 by which an FM station license was awarded to a country music station rather than a station featuring black and dance music oriented programming, which the city of Toronto had been lacking. The group released the single "CRTC (Can't Repress The Cause)" that went on to win the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Dance Music Video of the Year in 1991.
In 1993 Merrick released his second solo album as HDV, "Higher Deeper Values" again on ISBA Records. HDV was known for pornographic lyrics and for dealing with subjects such as the life of black people in Canada's inner cities as well as racial-tension and politics. Merrick also spent eight months in a Toronto jail after being convicted of living off the avails of prostitution.
Merrick moved to New York City, then on to California where he released the albums "In Yo' Face" in 1996 and "Narcissism" 1997 under the alias H-Bomb. "Narcissism" also gave rise to the single "Playa's Need No Love" with Roger Troutman, which peaked at number 33 on the Hot Rap Songs, making it Merrick's first charted single.
Merrick met Kool Keith and Ice-T and appeared on Keith's 1999 album "First Come, First Served" as well as the Analog Brothers' 2000 album "Pimp to Eat" under the moniker Jacky Jasper. Merrick, Kool Keith and rapper Marc Live formed the hip hop trio KHM and released their debut album in 2002 titled "Game". From 2002 to 2004, Merrick released two more solo albums under the Jacky Jasper alias, "Keep My Shit Clean" and "Jacky Who?". 2004 also saw the release of the sophomore KHM album titled "Clayborne Family".
In 2005, Merrick served as a producer on Shade Sheist's sophomore album "Before The Waitin' Before The Hatin"' under the name H-Bomb. Merrick and Keith collaborated once again to form a rap duo 7th Veil. They released an album titled "Stoned" in 2008, featuring production from Chilly Chill and guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Ike Turner, Rick James, Silkk the Shocker and Flavor Flav among others.
In 2009 Merrick co-founded the tabloid news site Diary of a Hollywood Street King under his pseudonym Jacky Jasper. Merrick would also become the main contributor to the site. The site was the first to publish Charlie Sheen's HIV status in April 2014.

His work in photography and visual art has earned him international renown featuring in many international exhibitions including Snap Judgment: New Position in contemporary African Photography, International center of photography New York (2006) He has been described as one of Nigeria's groundbreaking celebrity photographers who has "helped put Nigerian photography on the world map.". Vogue calls him "a major force in the creative scene in Nigeria."
Early life and education.
Born in Owerri, Imo State to the family of Justice Sylvester Amadi-Obi, a high court judge, and Mrs Theresa Amadi-Obi, an educationist, Amadi-Obi is the sixth of seven children. He attended Library Avenue Primary school, Umuahia, Abia State, and went to Government College Umuahia for his secondary education. His university education was at University Nigeria Nsukka, where he studied law.
He obtained his law degree in 1992 and was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1994. While on campus, he floated a small company which he named De-Zulu. Later, he grew more interested in the art of photography and eventually, after long years of practice, became a founding member of the Nigerian photography collective "Depth of Field", which had as one of its members, TY Bello who would also go on to be a successful photographer and musician.
Amadi-Obi in an interview with Onebello, a fashion magazine, when asked why he dumped law for photography, said the choice wasn't between photography and law, but between photography and art. He said he had always been an artist right from childhood. His work have been exhibited at the Lagos Photo Festival, Didi Museum, Rele Art Gallery, and other places.
Depth of Field.
In 2001, Amadi-Obi helped co-found "Depth of Field" (DOF) a collective of Nigerian photographers, artist and painters. It was an initiative of popular Nigerian photographer Uche James Iroha, ace photographer TY Bello, Amaize Ojeikere, Emeka Okereke, Kelechi Amad-Obi and Zainab Balogun, which took off after the six artists met in Bamako, Mali, during an art exhibition named "Memories Intimes D’un Nouveau Milleanaire Ives Recontres de la Photo" (Bamako, 2001). The group was formed with the goal of attaining photography excellence by gathering regularly to encourage each other and critic each other's work.
The group went ahead to organize art and photography exhibitions of their works in Nigeria and abroad.
Style Mania magazine.
After many years of shooting fashion and beauty photographs for the likes of True Love magazine, a South African magazine with a huge readership in Nigeria which went ahead to have a West African edition called "True Love West Africa", Amadi-Obi started his own glossy fashion magazine which he called "Style Mania" magazine. The magazine typically featured on its covers Nigerian artists and creative types like Tiwa Savage, P-Square, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, Stephanie Okereke, TY Bello, Agbani Darego, Bassey Ikpi, Mo’ Cheddah among others, all taken by Amadi-Obi.
Discovery of 'Bukola'.
In late 2016, during a photoshoot for hip hop artist Jidenna on Broad Street, Lagos, Amadi-Obi discovered Bukola, who was selling pillows on the streets of Lagos. He immediately showed interest in her as a potential model and scheduled a shoot in his studio. The result were a series of stunning photographs that went viral around Nigeria, turning the former pillow seller into an overnight success in modelling.

Löwenburg and Philippsburg

On a hill spur above the Eifel village of Monreal in Germany's Elzbach valley, at a height of , stand two neighbouring ruined hill castles: the Löwenburg, also called Monreal Castle (), and the Philippsburg. The latter is also known locally as "das Rech" (the Deer).
History.
The spur castle of Löwenburg was first recorded in 1229. Its builder was Count Hermann III of Virneburg, who ironically built it on the territory of his brother, Philip, following a partition agreement. The resulting fraternal feud was subsequently settled later, however, in a legal treaty and Philip relinquished his rights over the region to his brother.
The Philippsburg was also built in the 13th century. Its small size, in comparison with the "Löwen" (lion) gave rise to its local nickname, the "Rech" (deer). There are two different theories about its existence: one views the Phillipsburg simply as an advanced work or outwork of the Löwenburg; according to local tradition, however, the castle was Philip's answer to the unauthorised construction of the Löwenburg by his brother.
Although Monreal was on the territory of the Electorate of Trier, the counts of Virneburg always enjoyed good relations with the Electorate of Cologne. Their aim was, first and foremost, to secure ecclesial benefices for the numerous descendants of the Virneburg counts. For example, Henry II of Virneburg, born in 1244 or 1246, was initially the cathedral dean in Cologne. In 1306, at the age of about 60, he was elected as Archbishop of Cologne and held the office for 26 years. He had the task of consolidating the Cologne "Erzstift" in the decades after the Battle of Worringen in 1288 and the subsequent loss of power.
As a result of the close relations of the Virneburgs to Cologne and the fact that Henry II of Virneburg carried out constant attacks on the nearby Electoral Trier town of Mayen, a feud broke out between the Archbishop of Trier and the Virneburgs. At the behest of the Archbishop of Cologne, the two parties reached an agreement to the effect that Henry II would turn the Monreal castle into a fief of Trier after the death of his father, Robert III of Virneburg. This was done. The Virneburgs subsequently acquired ecclesial offices in Trier as well; in the 14th century alone, they provided six members of the cathedral chapter.
Under Robert IV of Virneburg, who was the lord of Monreal between 1384 and 1445, the estate was further developed and the castle was used several times as a dower house of the comital family in the 14th and 15th centuries. At the beginning of the 16th century, Monreal had already replaced the ancestral castle of the count's family in Virneburg.
When the line of the House of Virneburg died out with the death of Count Cuno in 1545, Henry of Leiningen succeeded him as the "Lehnsmann" or vassal. After 1555, however, the Elector of Trier did not perpetuate the fiefdom, but installed up his own "Amtmann".
In 1632, the imposing fortifications suffered heavy damage in a futile attempt to defend the town against Swedish troops and, in 1689, during the War of the Palatine Succession, it was finally destroyed by French troops. In 1815, in the course of secularisation, the ruins were granted to Prussia and remained in their ownership until the state castle administration (today: part of the General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate) inherited the inner bailey of the castle. From 1970 onwards, they had various safety measures carried out, so that the ruins of the castle can nowadays be freely visited.
Present condition.
Large parts of the ruins of the Löwenburg have been preserved, enabling the former appearance of the castle to be imagined. The remains of the 25-metre-high "bergfried", with its three-metre-thick walls, are highly visible from a long way off. Its elevated entrance faces the valley, i.e. the side facing away from the enemy. The tower was protected in the 15th century by a pointed shield wall which protected it against the firearms emerging at that time. Today it is accessible as a viewing tower.
The inner bailey of the castle is guarded by two neck ditches: an arched one protects it from the higher hillside to the northwest, another one separates it from the eastern outer bailey, of which only a few remains have survived.
The outer walls of the early Gothic castle chapel were once reinforced by an enceinte. Since its former vaults have collapsed, the remains of this church building are hardly recognizable any more.
Some significant elements of the Philippsburg have also survived, especially its northwest tower and the south wall, which was restored in 2007/2008.

James W. Downing

James Willis Downing (August 22, 1913 – February 13, 2018) was a lieutenant in the United States Navy. He retired in 1956 after 24 years of service, which included being commanding officer of the . At the time of his death, he was the second oldest living survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor, about which he authored a book.
Background.
Downing was born in Oak Grove, Missouri. At the time of his high school graduation, America was in the Great Depression. Jobs were scarce, so Downing enlisted in the Navy in September 1932. He began serving at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, California, the port for most of the Pacific naval fleet. He became a gunner's mate and postmaster aboard the .
Pearl Harbor.
On the morning of December 7, 1941, Downing and his new wife Morena were staying with his shipmates in Honolulu. The radio announced an attack on the Naval Station Pearl Harbor, and the sailors rushed to the port.
By the time Downing arrived at the "West Virginia", Japanese bombers had targeted her with nine torpedoes. Moored at a shallow water depth of only , the ship had not completely sunk, and her deck was on fire. Downing assisted the injured crew and used a water hose from the to keep the ammunition onboard from exploding.
Downing tried to commit to memory the names on the dog tags of those killed, and later visited the wounded at the naval hospital. He recorded the names of the wounded and fatally injured in a notebook, along with messages they wished to convey. As the postmaster, Downing had access to the home addresses of these men, and he later wrote notes to each family, explaining what had happened to their relatives and their current condition.
Later naval career.
Downing went on to be an adviser to the Brazilian fleet in Rio de Janeiro, serving aboard the , and was an assistant professor of Naval Science at Kings Point.
He also was made commanding officer of the , which served as a supply ship during the Korean War. Downing additionally assumed the role of ship chaplain. In 1954, he and his crew were exposed to very high levels of radiation from Castle Bravo, part of the series of nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll. He retired from the Navy in 1956.
After the Navy.
Prior to Pearl Harbor, Downing befriended Dawson Trotman, a Christian minister who eventually founded The Navigators, an interdenominational ministry. Trotman died the same year that Downing retired from the Navy, and the Downings moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, taking over Glen Eyrie, home of the branch there. Downing served as deputy president, chairman of the board of directors and director of the ministries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He retired as a full-time minister in 1983.
Personal life.
While serving together, Dawson Trotman encouraged Downing to court Morena Mae Holmes, an Arkansas native who had just graduated from Biola University in Los Angeles. They were married in July 1941 in Honolulu. On Christmas Day 1941, Morena returned to the mainland and would not see her husband again until they moved to Washington, D.C. in 1943. They each had responsibilities with The Navigators and remained in Colorado Springs after his retirement. They had seven children. Morena died on February 9, 2010, at age 93. Downing died on February 13, 2018, at age 104.
Book.
In 2016, Downing wrote an autobiography, titled "The Other Side of Infamy: My Journey through Pearl Harbor and the World of War". The book details his military career, Pearl Harbor, and how people of faith endure troubled times. Writing at age 102, Downing was honored by the Guinness World Records as the "oldest author living". With his death two years later, his title transitioned to "oldest author ever".

Italian destroyer Ugolino Vivaldi

Ugolino Vivaldi was one of twelve s built for the (Royal Italian Navy) between the late 1920s and the early 1930s.
Design and description.
The Navigatori-class destroyers were designed to counter the large French destroyers of the and es. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load, and at deep load. Their complement during wartime was 222–225 officers and enlisted men.
The "Navigatori"s were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam supplied by four Odero-Terni-Orlando water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce and a speed of in service, although the ships reached speeds of during their sea trials while lightly loaded. They carried enough fuel oil that was intended to give them a range of at a speed of .
Their main battery consisted of six guns in three twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the third amidships. Anti-aircraft (AA) defense for the Navigatori-class ships was provided by a pair of AA guns in single mounts abreast the forward funnel and a pair of twin-gun mounts for machine guns. They were equipped with six torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships. The Navigatoris could carry 86–104 mines.
Construction and career.
"Ugolino Vivaldi" was laid down by Odero-Terni-Orlando at their Genoa-Sestri Ponente shipyard on 16 May 1927, launched on 9 January 1929 and commissioned on 6 March 1930.
During the 1930s, "Vivaldi" largely operated with the Italian fleet, participating in exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. Between December 1930 and January 1931 she and seven sister ships were deployed in the Atlantic Ocean in support of Italo Balbo's transatlantic flight from Italy to Brazil. Between 1936 and 1938, "Vivaldi" also participated in the Spanish Civil War, that saw heavy Italian naval involvement in support of Francisco Franco's forces.
Originally classified as an "esploratore" (flotilla leader/scout cruiser), "Vivaldi" was re-rated as a destroyer in 1938. In 1939-1940 she underwent modification work to her bow.
World War II.
When Italy entered World War II, on 10 June 1940, "Vivaldi", under Captain Giovanni Galati was the flagship of the 14th Destroyer Division, which she formed along with sisterships "Leone Pancaldo", "Antonio Da Noli" and "Lanzerotto Malocello".
In August 1940, "Vivaldi" rammed and sank a submarine, HMS "Oswald", then rescuing nearly her entire crew. In the next year and a half she escorted dozens of supply convoys between Italy and North Africa and gained a reputation for "never losing a ship" This was credited to the fact that Captain Galati often disregarded orders coming from Supermarina, instead basing his decisions on his own assessment and experience; like other officers at the time, he was convinced that traitors hiding in the high ranks were informing the Allies about the convoys sailing for Africa, and that disregarding the instructions would reduce the risk of being intercepted (actually, the interception of many convoys was not caused by traitors, but instead by ULTRA intercepts, whose existence was unknown to the Axis).
In June 1942 "Vivaldi", now under Captain Ignazio Castrogiovanni, participated in an attack against a British convoy to Malta (Operation Harpoon) and, while clashing with the escorting destroyers, received a hit in the engine rooms that started a massive fire and left her dead in the water. The crippled "Vivaldi" and her consort "Malocello" ended up facing five British destroyers ("Bedouin", "Partridge", "Marne", "Matchless", "Ithuriel"), and at one point Captain Castrogiovanni radioed "I will fight to the last, long live the king" and ordered "Malocello" to abandon "Vivaldi" to her fate and save herself. "Malocello" refused, and remained to protect her disabled sistership. At this point the British escort leader, who at the time was facing the bulk of the Italian attack force (two cruisers and another three destroyers) a few miles away, recalled his destroyers to disengage "Vivaldi" and "Malocello" and assist in the main battle. The fire on "Vivaldi" burned for hours, virtually cutting the ship in two, with the crew in the bow unable to go to the stern and vice versa, but in the end the flames were extinguished and she was towed to port. Repairs for this damage took nearly one year.
On 9 September 1943, following the Italian Armistice, "Vivaldi" and sistership "Da Noli" were ordered to sail from Genoa to Civitavecchia, near Rome, where they would embark the king and the government and bring them to La Maddalena, Sardinia, to prevent them from being captured by the German forces, that had launched Operation Achse. However when the two ships arrived near Civitavecchia, the order was rescinded, as the Germans had already taken the Rome-Civitavecchia road and the king had fled towards Pescara, on the opposite coast of Italy. "Vivaldi" and "Da Noli" were ordered to sail west to meet the rest of the Italian fleet off La Maddalena, and once they were there, they were ordered to engage German craft that were transferring German troops from Sardinia to Corsica. They did so, and sank or damaged some of these craft, but they ended under fire from the coastal batteries on the Corsican coast, whose personnel – belonging to the Blackshirts – had turned over to the Germans. "Da Noli" sank on a mine, and "Vivaldi" was badly damaged, but managed to limp away. A few hours later, while sailing west at reduced speed, she was attacked again by German bombers, and further damaged by a Henschel Hs 293 guided missile. She still carried on for some more hours at a speed of a few knots, while the crew struggled to save the ship; but in the end her badly damaged engines ceased working, and her commanding officer, Captain Francesco Camicia, ordered her scuttled. "Vivaldi" sank on 10 September, about 50 miles west of Asinara island, taking down with her Lieutenant Commander Alessandro Cavriani and petty officer Virginio Fasan, who had gone back aboard to speed up her sinking.
Some of "Vivaldi"'s survivors were rescued by German floatplanes that were strafed and destroyed by American aircraft immediately thereafter, killing some of them. Others were picked up by a German vessel and ended up in POW camps in Germany, and some were rescued by an American floatplane. Another group was picked up by a British submarine, HMS "Sportsman", which brought them to Algeria, and dozens more reached the Balearic Islands (Spain) after spending days at sea in various boats, some of them staying adrift for a week or more. Overall, 58 members of her crew were lost, and 240 were rescued or managed to reach Spain.

Comprehensive Operation – Sinai 2018

Comprehensive Operation − Sinai 2018 () is the code name of a large counter-terrorism campaign conducted by the Egyptian Armed Forces and the Interior Ministry. The operation was initiated on February 9, 2018, and focuses on northern and central Sinai and parts of the Nile Delta. It mainly targets Islamist insurgents, as well as "other criminal activity that affects national security and stability", according to the Armed Forces press statement that announced the start of the campaign.
Following the Al-Rawda mosque attack of late November 2017, the deadliest of its kind in Egypt's modern history, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi gave the country's main security institutions a three-month deadline to secure the Sinai, a region that has witnessed an insurgency since the start of the Egyptian revolution of 2011. Security preparations for COS 2018 were reported from as early as January.
Preparation.
Security measures undertaken in Sinai by the government were reported a month prior to the operation. In January, military reinforcements arrived in the city of Al-Hasana in a scale "unprecedented" since the 2013 escalation in violence, according to "Mada Masr" quoting local residents. The equipment involved included Humvees, tanks and armored personnel carriers. "Asharq Al-Awsat", citing an unnamed security source, reported on 16 January that the deployments intensified in Arish, Sheikh Zuweid and Rafah in the past ten days, where authorities, backed by special forces, increased their gathering of intelligence through local pro-government tribal agents, UAVs and night vision devices. The Armed Forces intensified regulations on land crossings through the Suez Canal. According to "Mada Masr", vehicles with license plates from North Sinai were restricted from passing through the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel, thereby limiting the entry of supplies to the region's shop owners.
On February 7, two days before the announcement of Sinai 2018, "Mada Masr" reported that a large number of medical staff from different governorates in Egypt, mainly surgeons and anesthesiologists, were assigned by the Health Ministry to hospitals in the Ismailia Governorate and the Sinai for a period of three months at the request of the Armed Forces. Hospitals and ambulances in Arish were in a state of high alert. In the early morning hours of February 9, the day COS 2018 was launched, security forces shut down the North Sinai Coastal Road linking all the major cities and towns in the region, which had all their entrances barred to anyone entering or leaving. All schools throughout North Sinai were cancelled as of the following day, and university semesters were postponed. Gas stations in Arish were banned from pumping fuel to civilian vehicles. All Suez Canal crossings were closed. On the border with Gaza, the recently reopened Rafah Border Crossing was closed indefinitely by the Egyptian government until further notice. Palestinians who were already present on the Egyptian side of the border were escorted back to Gaza amid scuffles with security personnel.
Announcement.
At around 11:15 a.m. on February 9, Col. Tamer el-Refai, the military's spokesman, announced in a statement on state-run television, titled "Communique 1 from the General Command of the Armed Forces", the launching of Comprehensive Operation – Sinai 2018. The scope of the campaign would involve not only Sinai, but also other parts of Egypt, including the Nile Delta and the Western Desert. "Great people of Egypt, in accordance with the delegation issued by the President of the Republic, the Supreme Commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces, to the General Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces and the Interior Ministry to comprehensively confront terrorism as well other criminal activities in close cooperation with all state institutions," he said. According to the statement, military exercises would also be carried out as part of the operation. El-Refai concluded the statement by calling on all Egyptians to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and to report "elements that threaten the security and stability of the homeland" to authorities.
The Interior Ministry, on its part, raised the nationwide state of alert to the highest level, and focused on securing vital state facilities, including water and energy plants, as well as places of worship and tourist spots among other places.

FS Class E.331

FS Class E.331 was a class of three-phase electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways. Eighteen of these 2′C2′ locomotives were built between 1914 and 1919 by Breda and Brown-Boveri.
Overview.
Eighteen of these locomotives were built by Breda, with electrical parts by Brown-Boveri, between 1914 and 1919. The class had the same pole-changing system as the E.330 which allowed an increase in the number of economic speeds to four. Until a few years earlier, only two speeds could be obtained with the arrangement of cascade or parallel traction motor connections. In the E.331, a further two economic speeds could be obtained by changing the number of poles on the traction motors. One of the limitations of the machine, and the source of numerous failures, was the type of rotary switch used to vary the number of poles. Current was picked up from the two-wire overhead line by two pantographs, both continuously in use. The locomotive was built on a rigid frame, with three coupled axles driven by two jackshafts connected to the motors by inclined connecting rods. The front and rear bogies had smaller diameter wheels, as was usual for the locomotives of the time.
Service.
Class E.331 locomotives were used between Turin and Bussoleno, on the Frejus line. The 2′C2′ machines, with 100 km/h maximum speed and power of about 2,000 kW, were at their ease, especially on the flat or on gentle gradients.

New City College

New City College (NCC) is a large college of further education with campuses in East London and Essex. The college was formed in 2016 with the amalgamation of separate colleges, beginning with the merger between Tower Hamlets College and Hackney Community College, followed by the gradual additions of Redbridge College, Epping Forest College, and both Havering College of Further and Higher Education and Havering Sixth Form College. It is the second largest provider of post-16 education in the country since 2019.
Courses.
Various vocational and academic programmes are offered by the constituent colleges of New City Colleges such as A levels, BTECs, Diplomas, ESOL programmes and Access courses. In addition, certain colleges have currently or in the past provided some higher education courses in conjunction with the University of East London.
History and sites.
The college has 9 buildings and 5 campuses around London and Essex: Redbridge (Ilford and Chadwell Heath), Tower Hamlets (Poplar and Arbour Square), Hackney, Epping Forest (Debden) and Havering (Ardleigh Green, Rainham and Hornchurch). All of these were inherited from its predecessors.
Tower Hamlets.
The largest building of the Tower Hamlets campus is on Poplar High Street, about 700 m north of Canary Wharf; the others are at Arbour Square, Bethnal Green and the TowerSkills on East India Dock Road.
The college is housed in the former building of the School of Marine Engineering and Navigation established by the London County Council opened in 1906. This later evolved into Poplar Technical College, which retained a maritime focus. Tower Hamlets College (THC) was established in 1990.
The College faced increasing competition at sixth form provision from local schools in Tower Hamlets and underwent an OFSTED inspection in December 2013 which awarded the College good college status (Ofsted, December 2013) As of 2009/10 the college had 18,986 enrolments, of which 66% were adults age 19 and over.
The largest ethnic group in the college is Bangladeshi, predominantly Muslims. The college hosts one of the Great Britain's largest Islamic society of College. Tower Hamlets College was featured in the book of "The Islamist" by Ed Husain, who was a former president of the Islamic Society at THC and explains the growing Islamic fundamentalism of Muslim students part of the Islamic Society during 1992.
Hackney.
Its campus is in Falkirk Street in Hoxton, backing onto Hoxton Street. When the campus opened in 1996, it was Britain's largest capital further education building project.
The college was originally named Hackney College when it was formed in 1974 by the amalgamation of Hackney and Stoke Newington College of Further Education with those sites of Poplar Technical College that had been established in Hackney. It was initially run by Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and, following that, by Hackney Council, when it was renamed. For a few years it was known as The Community College Shoreditch, but later reverted to the name Hackney Community College (dating from the process known as "incorporation" in 1993 when it was formed from the merger of Hackney College, Hackney Sixth Form Centre and Hackney Adult Education Institute, as a result of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.) In August 2016, Hackney Community College merged with Tower Hamlets to create a more responsive and financially robust larger organisation, named New City College.
It is home to the Tech City Apprenticeship, the London Technical Fashion Academy, the London City Hospitality Centre and its training restaurant, Open Kitchen.
HCC's SPACe (Sport and Performing Arts Centre) was funded by Sport England as a centre of excellence in cricket and basketball. SPACe was home to London United Basketball and is still the base for the Hackney Community College Basketball Academy, as well as academies in other sports. SPACe was used as a training camp for basketball during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Previous Hackney institutions.
'Hackney College' has also been widely used (by Pevsner and others) to refer specifically to Brooke House, until September 2002 one of the Community College's sites. This has now become BSix Sixth Form College.
The modern version of the term should also be distinguished from previous Hackney Colleges:
Both of these merged in 1900, becoming the University of London's first Faculty of Theology. In 1924 this became, by Act of Parliament, a constituent college known as Hackney and New College, the two names by which its disparate buildings throughout north London were commonly known. In 1934 new premises were planned. In 1936, the name of the college was simplified to New College London, harking back to the Congregationalist merger of 1850.
Redbridge.
The Redbridge Campus has two sites in Ilford, one in the town centre and another next to King George Hospital.
Redbridge College began life as Redbridge Technical College on 2 June 1970. It offered vocational courses in a range of subjects. It was once a major centre for deaf students or those with learning difficulties. The college merged into New City College in 2017.
Epping Forest.
The Epping Forest campus is located in Borders Lane in Debden, a suburb of Loughton.
Epping Forest College was founded in 1989 as a tertiary college after the re-organisation of post-16 education in south-west Essex. It was created from the Loughton College of Further Education and the sixth forms from seven local secondary schools. Due to financial strains, the college merged with New City College in 2018, a move that was protested by Epping Forest District council fearing it would lose community focus.
Havering Colleges.
Havering Colleges is a constituent college formed from Havering College of Further and Higher Education and Havering Sixth Form College. Collectively the Havering Colleges, they retain their individual identities as part of the New City College group.

English cricket team in the West Indies in 2018–19

The England cricket team toured the West Indies between January and March 2019 to play three Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The series included England's first Test match in Saint Lucia, when they played at the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground. It was also England's first tour to the West Indies to play all three formats of international cricket since they visited in 2009. The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
The West Indies won the first two Test matches, taking an unassailable lead in the series, and therefore winning the Wisden Trophy. It was their first Test series win against England since 2009. However, the West Indies captain Jason Holder was suspended for the third and final Test of the series, after the team's slow over-rate in the second Test. Kraigg Brathwaite was named as the West Indies' captain for the third Test in Holder's place. The West Indies won the series 2–1, after England won the third Test by 232 runs.
During the ODI series, multiple individual and team records were broken by both sides. England's captain Eoin Morgan became the first batsman for the England team to score 6,000 runs in ODIs. Chris Gayle became the second batsman for the West Indies, after Brian Lara, to score 10,000 runs in ODIs. The ODI series was drawn 2–2, after the third match was washed out, finishing as a no result.
For the T20I series, the West Indies retained players that were selected for the ODI matches, with Jason Holder named as the T20I captain in place of their regular T20I captain Carlos Brathwaite. During the second match, the West Indies were bowled out for 45, which was the second-lowest total in T20Is and the lowest by a Full Member nation. England won the T20I series 3–0.
Squads.
Olly Stone was ruled out of England's Test squad with a back injury, and was replaced in the squad by Mark Wood. Ahead of the second Test, England's Adil Rashid flew home to attend the birth of his second child. Keemo Paul was added to the West Indies' squad for the third Test, after Jason Holder was suspended.
Shannon Gabriel was not originally named in the West Indies' ODI squad, but was added to the team after injuries to Rovman Powell and Keemo Paul. However, during the third Test, Gabriel was heard saying a homophobic remark towards England's captain Joe Root. As a result, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Gabriel for four ODI matches. John Campbell, Carlos Brathwaite and Sheldon Cottrell were added to the West Indies' ODI squad, following injuries to Evin Lewis, Rovman Powell and Keemo Paul, and Shannon Gabriel's suspension. Kemar Roach was ruled out of the West Indies' ODI squad due to injury, and was replaced by Andre Russell for the fourth and fifth ODIs.
Sam Curran was added to England's T20I squad, after Moeen Ali announced he would fly home after the last ODI match to rest ahead of the 2019 Indian Premier League. Obed McCoy was added to the West Indies' T20I squad, after Andre Russell was forced to pull out of the side due to injury.

Rajni Tilak

Rajni Tilak (27 May 1958 – 30 March 2018) was one of the most prominent Indian Dalit rights activists and a leading voice of Dalit feminism and writing. She served as the Executive Director of the Centre for Alternative Dalit Media, co-founded the National Association of Dalit Organisations, and served as President of the Dalit Lekhak Sangh (Dalit Writers' Group).
Early life.
Tilak was born in Old Delhi, India on 27 May 1958 in a family with limited means. Her father was a tailor whose ancestors had migrated to Delhi from the state of Uttar Pradesh. Being the first of seven children, she had to give up on her aspiration of becoming a nurse due to lack of financial support and took up a job to aid her family. She had an early interest in writing, expressed by writing a poem called “"Ka Se Kahu Dukh Apna”" as her first poem. After completing her higher education in 1975, she joined ITI (Industrial Training Institute) for vocational courses like stenography, cutting and tailoring.
Activism and career.
While in college at ITI in Delhi, she organised a union for girls protesting the gender based discrimination faced by them. She found her strength as a leader, merging this group with the Progressive Students' Union (PSU). She later split from them citing ideological and political differences. She also went on to organise a 4000-strong organisation of anganwadi workers, to address demands of regularization of pay scale. Over the years Tilak became involved in Dalit activism and also made her mark by also challenging patriarchy within the caste dimension. She organised agitations over the Mathura rape case in 1972 all over Delhi and became associated with "Saheli", an autonomous women's group. There onward she began working on issues of health, sanitation, counselling for family planning, rape, molestation, etc.
In the 1980s, Tilak started a union with "Bharthiya Dalit Panthers" in Delhi. They opened a Dalit theatre group called "Ahahwan" and started a students' awareness programme by establishing a youth study circle.
She was associated with multiple organisations, such as NACDAOR (National Confederation of Dalit and Adivasi Organizations), CADAM (Center for Alternative Dalit Media), NFDW (National Federation of Dalit Women), Rashtriya Dalit Mahila Andolan (RDMA), and many more.
In 2011, the Bollywood film "Aarakshan" (directed by Prakash Jha) caused controversy, as the director was alleged to have insulted Dalits. Tilak was asked to view the film before its release. In 2012, she was part of a coalition of Dalit and non-Dalit writers, scholars, and activists who petitioned the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to correctly represent the role of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in school textbooks.
Death.
Tilak died on 30 March 2018 at the age of 59 at St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi. She had been taken to the hospital for treatment for an illness of the spine. She is survived by her daughter- actor, artist, activist and writer Jyotsna Siddharth.
Her death was mourned by several scholars and activists. Condolence meetings were held around the country and tributes were paid on social media websites including by her friend Kavita Srivastava, leader of People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL).

Red Three

The Red Three () was the Switzerland section of the so-called Red Orchestra. It was established and maintained by Soviet Military Intelligence Staff Division 4.
Name history, and activities.
The terms "Red Three", and "Red Orchestra" respectively, were invented by the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA), the counter-espionage arm of the SS. As essential part of the "Red Orchestra", the "Red Three (radio stations)" (de: die "Roten Drei (Funkstellen)") were outside the reach of German security forces, located in Switzerland. It was headed by Alexander Radó (code name: DORA), a Hungarian émigré, Communist, and geographer. The "Red Three" was founded in 1936, when "Radó" arrived in Geneva. By April 1942, the organization had been established with "Radó" as group leader, and also had three subgroup leaders: Rachel Dübendorfer (code name: SISSY), Georges Blun (code name: LONG), and Otto Pünter (code name: PAKBO).
After the imprisonment of Leopold Trepper (code name: GRAND CHEF) by the Gestapo in 1942, "Radó's" group became the most effective part of the "Red Orchestra" espionage network. It collected useful information in Switzerland and had some contacts inside Germany. Perhaps most importantly, "Radó" was also in touch with the Lucy spy ring, which had very valuable contacts inside Germany, and was linked to British intelligence. Some people have speculated that the "Lucy ring" was used by British intelligence to pass Ultra information to Soviet intelligence without revealing the codebreaking operation that was its source, but most historians do not agree with this theory.
In 1944–1945, "Radó" was recalled to the USSR and charged with spying for Britain and the U.S. He was imprisoned for eight years, but was released and rehabilitated after Stalin's death.
