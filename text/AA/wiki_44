Dridhaprahara

Dridhaprahara (IAST: Dṛḍhaprahāra, r. c. 860-880) is the earliest historically attested ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty that ruled the western Deccan region in present-day India.
Early life.
According to Jain tradition, Dridhaprahara was a son of king Vajrakumara of Dvaraka. When his mother was pregnant with him, a great fire destroyed the city. Jain saint Jainaprabhasuri saved his mother, he was born sometime after the destruction of Dvaraka. Dridhaprahara was a devotee of the eighth Jain tirthankara Chandraprabha.
Dridhaprahara is one of the earliest historically attested ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty grew under the care of 8th Tirthankara Chadraprabhu Swami also named his capital "Chandraditypura" after him"."
No historical evidence connects Dridhaprahara or his dynasty to Dvaraka: after rising to prominence, the dynasty started claiming descent from the legendary hero Yadu, whose descendants (called the Yadavas) are associated with Dvaraka. The dynasty's claim of connection with that city may simply be a result of their claim of descent from Yadu rather than their actual geographic origin. Epigraphic evidence suggests that the dynasty likely emerged from a Kannada-speaking background. The name "Dridhaprahara" may be a Sanskritized form of the Kannada name "Dhāḍiyappā", which was also borne by two of Dridhaprahara's successors.
Rise to power.
The "Nasikkya-pura-kalpa" section of Jinaprabha-suri's "Vividha-tirtha-kalpa" provides following account of Dridhaprahara's rise to power: Once, cattle thieves raided his town, and stole the people's cows. Dridhaprahara single-handedly fought the thieves and retrieved the cows. The local Brahmins and other honoured him with the title "Talarapaya" ("the protector of the village"). 
Historian A. S. Altekar theorizes that Dridhaprahara was a warrior living around 860, when Pratihara-Rashtrakuta wars would have brought instability to the Khandesh region. He probably protected the region against enemy raids, because of which people started paying him taxes, and his family rose to prominence.
Legacy.
Dridhaprahara is the earliest historically attested ruler of his dynasty, and finds a mention in the Vasai (Bassein) and Asvi inscriptions. He is said to have established the city of Chandradityapura (modern Chandor).
His son and successor was Seunachandra, who was probably a Rashtrakuta feudatory, and after whom the dynasty came to be known as Seuṇa-vaṃśa.

Post-Apocalypto

Post-Apocalypto is the fourth studio album by American rock band Tenacious D. Produced by bassist John Spiker, it was released in North America on November 2, 2018, by Columbia Records. In addition to core members Jack Black and Kyle Gass, the album also marks the return of John Konesky (electric guitar), Spiker (bass) and Dave Grohl (drums), who have all performed on previous Tenacious D albums. The album features songs and audio snippets from "Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto," the band's animatic YouTube series to support the album.
Background.
In June 2012, when asked about a sequel to Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Black stated that the band had "found a loophole with the internet and animated shorts. That’s the world we’re looking to dive into, and not just for money, mainly for art." The band would mention later on in that year that they may make an Internet series ""exclusive to YouTube"" The project was a fantasy for Black and Gass for a few years, until the Donald Trump Presidential Campaign inspired them to write a post-apocalyptic pilot episode in 2016. The remaining episodes would be completed between 2017 and 2018.
Release and promotion.
The band filmed a teaser for their Facebook page of them in the studio in May 2016. In December 2017, whilst on Kerrang Radio promoting "", Black stated that the title of a new animated series would be called "Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto".
In May 2018, the band entered and left the stage of Hell &amp; Heaven Metal Fest in Mexico City to recordings of "Post-Apocalypto Theme" and "Post-Apocalypto Theme (Reprise)" - this being the world reveal of these tracks. A few days later, the band uploaded a tour trailer to their website and social media, also teasing a new album.

The Athenaeum (South Africa)

The Athenaeum (an institution for the promotion of literary or scientific learning) building is at the heart of a burgeoning creative industry in Port Elizabeth. It is situated at the corner of Castle Hill and Belmont Terrace in Nelson Mandela Bay. The building aims to cultivate, develop and promote the culture, heritage and arts of the Eastern Cape. It was opened on 26 July 1896 and was designed by George William Smith. It was declared a national monument in 1980 and is listed as one of the provincial heritage sites of Port Elizabeth.
Architecture.
The Athenaeum was erected during the height of the Victorian era thus the designer, George William Smith, designed the building in a typically Victorian manner. It is a two-storey building with two distinct sections which were opened in 1896 and 1901 respectively. The Belmont Terrace facade has two wings which are joined by a central arched entrance porch, which is a classic of the Victorian style. The building has elements of 19th century neoclassicism and the architectural style used was Edwardian Baroque.
History.
In the 1850s, a group of intellectuals and willing citizens in the area of Algoa Bay came together to form the Athenaeum Society with the aim of promoting cultural, artistic and scientific activities within the town. The formation of this society was largely motivated by the lack of public entertainment within their region.
Committee members from the local library, the Athenaeum Society and the municipality held a meeting on 20 October 1856 to appeal to the colonial government to accord land to erect a Town Hall, which would accommodate municipal offices, a library, a museum and an athenaeum (place of further learning). A Town Hall was erected in 1858, which secured a home for the Athenaeum Society. Thus the society initially operated out of a space in the Town Hall but, as the library and museum grew and expanded into the space which the Athenaeum Society occupied, the society was forced to cease all activities in that space.
In 1882 an Art School was founded in Port Elizabeth. The number of its members grew exponentially so new premises were sought after. In 1891 Dr Hewitt, the founder of the Young Men's Institute, was also looking for premises for his society. In that very year the Photographic Society and Naturalist Society were founded and also sought premises in which to operate. The four societies thus came together to reinvigorate the Athenaeum.
The Town Council subsequently granted the new Athenaeum some council land and offered to erect a building if each society contributed the equivalent of €1000, which they did. An agreement was signed that stated that the building would remain the property of the Town Council, but would be made available to the societies, rate free. It also stipulated that the Athenaeum Council was responsible for the interior maintenance of the building whilst the municipality was responsible for the exterior. The Athenaeum Council, together with further funding from the Town Council, erected The Athenaeum in 1896. Since its opening in 1896, the Athenaeum has been home to numerous creative societies and leveraged off partnerships with the Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA), the Arts Journey, the National Arts Festival, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism.
1900s.
In 1946, the Port Elizabeth Music and Dramatic Society (PEMADS) rented and renovated the Loubser Hall into a theatre, which is known today as the Ford Little Theatre. In the early 2000s the Athenaeum building went into a state of dilapidation and closed down. The Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) took over the building in 2010 and started renovations. The Athenaeum and Ford Little Theatre were reopened in 2012.
Present day.
The Athenaeum serves as a cradle of diverse activities within the arts industry. It showcases both national and international art exhibitions, live performances, art interventions and theatre shows. A number of emerging creatives hold office and studio space within the building. It is considered a fusion of new South African art and old South African design. To ensure sustainability, The Athenaeum also offers services such as venue hire, exhibition hosting and curation, event management, bar services, marketing and promotion and service provider management.
Ford Little Theatre.
This venue is a stage for many creative industry pursuits, from live theatre productions and shows to live concerts, film screenings, conferences, debates and book launches.

George Bingham (antiquary)

George Bingham (1715–1800) was an English cleric and antiquarian.
Life.
The sixth son of Richard Bingham, and Philadelphia, daughter and the heir of John Potinger, by Philadelphia, daughter of Sir John Ernle, chancellor of the exchequer, he was born on 7 November 1715 at Melcombe, Dorset. He was brought up under the care of his maternal grandfather, Mr. Potinger. At age 12 he was sent to Westminster School, and in 1732 he was elected from the foundation to a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, but entered Christ Church, Oxford as a commoner. After taking his B.A. degree he was elected a fellow of All Souls, and there graduated M.A. in 1739 and B.D. in 1748. At All Souls he formed lasting friendships with Sir William Blackstone and Dr. Benjamin Buckler, whom he assisted in drawing up the "Stemmata Chicheliana".
In 1746, during the Jacobite rebellion, Bingham served the office of proctor in the university, and acted with great spirit. On the death of the Rev. Christopher Pitt, the translator of the "Æneid", Bingham was instituted, on 23 May 1748, to the rectory of Pimperne, Dorsetshire. He resigned his fellowship on his marriage; but his wife, by whom he had a daughter and two sons, died in 1760 at the age of thirty-five. He had just been presented by Sir Gerard Napier to the living of More Critchell (1755), to which that of Long Critchell was annexed in 1774. He was elected proctor for the diocese of Salisbury in the convocations of 1761, 1768, 1774, and 1780. His eldest son, the senior scholar at Winchester, was accidentally drowned while bathing in the river Itchin in 1708. In 1781 Bishop Bagot offered him the Warburtonian lecture, but he declined to preach it, because he held that the church of Rome, though corrupt, was not chargeable, as Warburton meant to prove, with apostasy.
Bingham died at Pimperne on 11 October 1800, aged 85, and was buried in the chancel of the church. A marble monument, with a long inscription in Latin, was erected to his memory.
Works.
Bingham published in his lifetime:
Bingham assisted to John Hutchins with his "History of Dorsetshire". His "Biographical Anecdotes" of Hutchins are printed in the "Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica", No. xxxiv, 2nd ed. London, 1813.

Jurate Rosales

Jūratė Regina Statkutė de Rosales is a Lithuanian-born Venezuelan journalist and amateur historian. She has published studies in Venezuela, Spain, the United States and Lithuania in which she claims that the Goths were not a Germanic but a Baltic people.
Biography.
Rosales was born on 9 September 1929 in Kaunas, Lithuania and lived with her parents, at least partly in Paris, until 1938. Her father, Jonas Statkus, was head of the State Security Department of Lithuania until he was arrested on 6 July 1940 along with Augustinas Povilaitis, General Kazys Skučas, and several other high officials after the Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania. He was sent to Butyrka prison in Moscow where it is presumed he died on an unknown date. After the end of the Second World War, Rosales moved to France where she learned Latin and French, receiving a degree as a teacher of French. She continued her studies at Columbia University in New York, where she taught English, Spanish, and German. In 1960 she married Venezuelan engineer Luis Rosales; they raised five children—Luis, Juan, Sarunas, Rimas, and Saulius—in a multi-lingual household, using both Spanish and Lithuanian. Starting in 1983 she held the position of editor-in-chief of the Venezuelan opposition magazine "Zeta", in addition to writing for Venezuelan daily paper "El Nuevo País" and the Cleveland-based "Dirva". She holds an honorary doctorate from the Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences.
Hypothesis on the Goths being Baltic.
Rosales has published studies in the US, Spain, Venezuela, and Lithuania supporting the idea that the Goths were a Baltic, not Germanic people. Rosales traces her research on the controversial hypothesis back to 17th-century Prussian scholar Matthäus Prätorius who is thought to have first proposed the idea, which was supported by several Lithuanian historians including Simonas Daukantas and Česlovas Gedgaudas as well as linguist Kazimieras Būga.
The idea has been heavily criticized by other academics such as Zigmas Zinkevičius as pseudohistory primarily driven by nationalist, not academic concepts. Professors Alvydas Butkus and Stefano M. Lanza make similar criticisms of her methodology, to the point of accusing her of twisting the meaning of sources and using "nonexistent" Lithuanian words. In response to Butkus and Lanza, de Rosales pointed out their lack in depth of knowledge when analysing of her texts and that they only focused on one page of the book, ignoring the rest.

The Road to Calvary

The Road to Calvary (), also translated as "Ordeal", is a trilogy of novels by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, tracing the fate of the Russian intelligentsia on the eve of, during, and after the revolution of 1917. It consists of the novels Sisters (1918–1922; «Сёстры»), The Eighteenth Year (1927–1928; «Восемнадцатый год») and Gloomy Morning (1940–1941; «Хмурое утро»). The first part was written for the "émigré " readers, while the rest was written as a work of Socialist realism. 
Background.
The first part, "Sisters", was written from 1918 to 1920, during the author's emigration, while the rest he wrote after his return to Soviet Russia. The novel "Sisters" was published in the White émigré journals "Gryadushchaya Rossiya" and "Sovremennye zapiski" under the title "Walking Through Torments". In 1941, after the start of the Great Patriotic War, Tolstoy reworked the 2 first parts and wrote the third one as works of socrealism.
Plot.
In the first chapters of the epic, St. Petersburg is shown in the beginning of 1914. Sisters Dasha and Ekaterina (Katya) Bulaviny, originally from Samara, are carried away by the poet-decadent Bessonoff. Katya is married to Smokovnikov, a lawyer, and has an illicit affair behind his back.
Over time, Ekaterina Dmitrievna falls in love with officer Vadim Petrovich Roshchin, and Dasha with Ivan Ilyich Telegin, an engineer at the Baltic plant. World War I, two revolutions and civil war carry the four main characters to different corners of the country. Their paths intersect more than once and again diverge. Roshchin joins the Volunteer Army, and Telegin joins the Red Army. At the end of the war, all four meet in the capital of Soviet Russia, where in the presence of Lenin and Stalin they enthusiastically listen to Gleb Krzhizhanovsky's historic report on the GOELRO plan.
Awards.
For his trilogy Alexey Tolstoy was awarded the Stalin Prize of the first degree in the amount of 100,000 rubles on March 19, 1943, which he transferred to the Defense Fund for the construction of the tank "Grozny" (T-34 No. 310-0929).

Sergey Nalobin

Sergey Nalobin (born 1979) is a Russian diplomat, a Deputy Director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian MFA.
Early life and family.
Sergey Nalobin was born in Tyumen. His father is Nikolai Nalobin, a former KGB agent and later FSB General. His brother also worked for the FSB. In 1996, Nalobin graduated from Moscow school No.594. From 1996 to 2001, Sergey Nalobin studied in Moscow State University of International Relations, he graduated with excellence from the faculty of International Law.
Career.
After graduation, Sergey Nalobin joined the Russian diplomatic service: from 2001 to 2004, he served as the attaché and later as the third secretary of the Russian Embassy in Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
During 2010–2015, Nalobin was the first secretary of the political section at the Russian Embassy to the United Kingdom where his dossier included the development of bilateral relations between both countries and political and legal issues.
In 2011, as the head of Bilateral Relations section at the embassy in London, Sergey Nalobin took part in the Cambridge Union Society debates “This House Believes there are no Freedom-Fighters, only Terrorists”. Mr Nalobin's speech was devoted to the Russian experience in fighting terrorism.
In June 2012, he attended informal meetings of the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee along with Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the committee for International Affairs of the Russian State Duma and Alexander Yakovenko, Russian ambassador to London, in which he was described as head of the Bilateral Relations Group at the Russian Embassy. In August 2012, as the political counsellor, he helped to arrange a reception at the Embassy on the occasion of establishment of the Conservative Friends of Russia, headed by the Honorary President RtHon Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Organisation was aimed at strengthening relations between British and Russian communities, business and organizations, encouraging individuals to explore history and culture, advancing a greater understanding of the comparative political systems and providing a forum for open discussion of issues related to Russia and Great Britain.
In November 2014, Nalobin, presented the Medal of Ushakov to the survivors of the Second World War Arctic convoys and their descendants at a ceremony in Worcester when he was described as a counsellor at the Russian Embassy. In December 2014, he presented more Ushakov medals in Exeter.
In 2015, Sergey Nalobin took part in the discussion on the issue of religious intolerance in the Middle East at the House of Lords hosted by Lord Howell and Lord Lothian. On March 19, the Russian diplomat took part in a seminar devoted to the European Union Committee's report “The EU and Russia: before and beyond the crisis in Ukraine". It was a thought-provoking discussion with a professional approach to the matter in question.
Nalobin left London in 2015 after concluding his five-year mission to the UK.
In November 2017, "The Guardian" published an article about the reason of Sergey Nalobin's leaving the UK. However, in February 2018, "The Guardian" added a note with a correction that the Russian diplomat left the country, because his visa was expired:
"At the readers' editor’s request the Russian embassy provided copies of its note to the FO on 10 November 2017, which sought an explanation of whether Mr Nalobin had been expelled by having his permission to stay revoked, and the FO’s reply. The FO confirmed the authenticity of its reply, 9 February 2018, which says in part that it 'can confirm that Mr Sergey Nalobin was not expelled from the UK. The [relevant FO] Directorate understand that Mr Nalobin left the UK upon the expiry of his vignette [a kind of visa].'"
Digital Diplomacy.
The Digital Diplomacy Unit at the Department of Information and Press of the Russian MFA is under the direction of Sergey Nalobin. The Unit sets the priority of providing the target audience (who is the Russian-speaking people) with the most recent official foreign policy coverage conducted by rich media content. Hence, over the past few years the Ministry has maintained its strong presence on the most popular global media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, as well as services like Viber and VKontakte.
On the platform of Twiplomacy, Mr. Nalobin stresses that "one of the goals is to deliver multilingual content with as little latency and as much outreach that we can possibly achieve. This, of course, applies to Facebook, where we have a 'multi-purpose' account for both Russian and English-speaking followers. While the majority of our publications on this platform are indeed in Russian, all comments, statements and interviews related to the most pressing foreign policy issues, as well as coverage of Foreign Minister’s activities are translated into English."
Regarding all the social media pages of the Ministry, the Digital Diplomacy Unit foremost relies on the Foreign Ministry's multilingual website as a news source which is as well as covered on Facebook. This compromises: text publications, visual content provided by its own team of photographers, camera crews and IT engineers. Therefore, they facilitate the social media division to manage the platform features, for instance, streaming Foreign Minister's public appearance worldwide directly to its Facebook account.
Activity.
In May 2017, Sergey Nalobin gave an interview to Sputnik at the International forum of the Russian-speaking broadcasters where he touched on the issue of how digital diplomacy is crucial for promoting objective information on the Russian policy. In November 2017, Nalobin was a visiting lecturer in Moscow State University of International Relations: he outlined the modern information policy of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affaires. In July 2018, Nalobin attended the Conference “The prospects for development of medical tourism in Russian regions” in Ryazan. The diplomat pointed out that the Russian MFA is interested in proposing its digital resources for development of medical capacity in Ryazan in order to properly capture positive significant events concerning medicine in this region.

Gaius Calpetanus Rantius Sedatus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of March to April 47 with Hordeonius Flaccus as his colleague. He is known primarily from inscriptions.
His "cursus honorum" is known only piecemeal. The first known office Sedatus held was "curator tabullarium publicorum" in 45, a post reserved for senators of praetorian status. After he was suffect consul, the emperor Claudius appointed him governor of the province of Dalmatia.
His father was probably Gaius Calpetanus C.f. Statius Rufus. Gaius Calpetanus Rantius Quirinalis Valerius Festus, suffect consul in 71, has been identified as his adopted son.

<doc id="56885701" url="?curid=56885701" title="Bhillama II">
Bhillama II

Bhillama II (r. c. 985–1005 CE) was a ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Deccan region in India. He was a vassal of the Kalyani Chalukya ruler Tailapa II, and played an important role in Tailapa's victory against the Paramara king Munja.
Early life.
Bhillama was a son and successor of the Yadava chief Dhadiyasa, who was a Rashtrakuta feudatory. He married the Rashtrakuta princess Lakshmi. When the Kalyani Chalukya chief Tailapa II overthrew the Rashtrakutas, Bhillama transferred his allegiance to Chalukyas.
An inscription of the contemporary Shilahara ruler Aparajita states that he granted protection to a king named Bhillama. It is possible that this is a reference to some sort of alliance between Aparajita and Bhillama when they were both Rashtrakuta vassals.
Military career.
Bhillama appears to have played an important role in Chalukya-Paramara war, which resulted in the defeat and death of the Paramara king Munja. His 1000 Sangamner inscription poetically boasts that he thrashed the goddess of prosperity Lakshmi on the battlefield because she had sided with Munja, and forced her to become an obedient housewife in the palace of the Chalukya king Tailapa.
The Chalukya king rewarded Bhillama by adding the present-day Ahmednagar area to his hereditary fief. The Sangamner inscription describes Bhillama as a "Maha-samanta" ("great feudatory"), and mentions his epithets "Pancha-maha-shabada", "Aratini-sudana", "Kandukacharya", "Sellavidega", and "Vijayabharana".
Legacy.
Bhillama erected the Vijayabharneshvara temple at Sangamner. He was succeeded by Vesugi, who married Nayilladevi, the daughter of a Chalukya feudatory of Gujarat.

Prostitution in Antigua and Barbuda

Prostitution in Antigua and Barbuda is legal and common. Related activities such as brothel keeping and solicitation are prohibited. UNAIDS estimate there to be 755 prostitutes on the islands, the majority are migrants from other Caribbean countries. They tend to move around the Caribbean, never staying in one territory for long. In 2011, prostitution was on the rise due to poor economic conditions. 
In the capital, St. John's, there is a red-light district in Popeshead Street. The most famous brothel in the street was Wendy's. It had operated for a number of years and was a household name on the island. In 2016 the owners were charged with trafficking. A 'rescue mission' raided the establishment in 2018, looking for trafficking victims. The nearby 'Jam Dung' was also raided.
The NGO, 'Health, Hope and HIV Network', offers counselling and testing for HIV and other STIs to sex workers. Their motto is 'Creating Positive Change' and the organisation receives government funding.
Sex trafficking.
Sex trafficking is a problem in Antigua and Barbuda.
Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Antigua and Barbuda, and traffickers exploit victims from Antigua and Barbuda abroad. Documented and undocumented immigrants from the Caribbean region, notably Jamaica, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic, are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Authorities reported an increased number of trafficking victims in multiple-destination trafficking, arriving in Antigua and Barbuda for a few months before their traffickers exploited them in other Caribbean countries such as St. Kitts and Nevis and Barbados. Sex trafficking occurs in bars, taverns, and brothels, including with minor girls. There are anecdotal reports of parents and caregivers subjecting children to sex trafficking. There have been reports of trafficking-related complicity by police officers who tend to receive administrative sanctions instead of being tried under the trafficking law.
The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention) Act, 2010, which was amended in 2015 to vest jurisdiction for trafficking cases to the High Court of Justice, prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of 20 to 30 years imprisonment and fines of 400,000 to 600,000 Eastern Caribbean dollars. Experts noted the prosecutor's office had limited staff and resources and were concerned the police were not undertaking proactive raids to uncover sex trafficking cases. Between 2010 and 2015, a total of 43 women were reported to the Directorate of Gender Affairs as being trafficked.
The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Antigua and Barbuda as a 'Tier 2' country.

<doc id="56885735" url="?curid=56885735" title="International Lunar Observatory">
International Lunar Observatory

The International Lunar Observatory (ILO-1) is a private scientific and commercial lunar mission to place a small observatory on the South Pole of the Moon to conduct astrophysical studies using an optical telescope. The mission, planned for launch in 2022 or 2023, aims to prove a conceptual design for a lunar observatory that would be reliable, low cost, and fast to implement. A precursor mission, ILO-X, is planned for launch in early 2022 aboard the Intuitive Machines IM-1 mission. It is hoped to be a technology precursor to a future radio observatory on the Moon, and other commercial initiatives.
The ILO-1 mission, announced on July 2017, is being organized by the International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) and the Space Age Publishing Company. The prime contractors are Moon Express, providing the MX-1E lander, and Canadensys Aerospace, that is providing the optical telescope system. The estimated cost in 2004 was of US$50 million.
Overview.
The ILO-1 mission, originally planned to be launched in 2008, was initially scheduled to be launched in July 2020 with an Electron rocket from New Zealand. The mission was called "Moon Express Lunar Scout", and it would have used the MX-1E lander to deliver the observatory on top of the Malapert Mountain, a 5 km tall peak in the Aitken Basin region that has an uninterrupted direct line of sight to Earth, which facilitates communications any time. The status of these plans is currently (March 2020) unknown, as the launch of the MX-1E lander with an Electron rocket was cancelled sometime before February 2020; no launch date or launch rocket for the MX-1E has been since announced, leaving the status of it and ILO-1 unknown. 
The small robotic observatory is designed to withstand the long lunar nights so it is expected to operate for a few years. Moon Express would have also utilized the mission to explore the Moon's South Pole for mineral resources including water ice. The optical portion of the system is a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope. The optical system uses a 7 cm diameter lens, with an 18 cm focal plane, a 13 cm f/5.6 aperture, and 6.4-megapixel resolution. The telescope system is "about the size of a shoe-box" with a mass of approximately 2 kg.
Some partners include the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the newly formed Southeast Asia Principal Operating Partnership, and others.
Objective.
The mission's objective is to conduct astrophysical observations from the surface of the Moon, whose lack of atmosphere eliminates much of the need for costly adaptive optics technology. Also, since the Moon's days (about fourteen Earth days) have a dark sky, it allows for nonstop astronomical observations. Disadvantages include micrometeorite impacts, cosmic and solar radiation, lunar dust, and temperature shifts as large as 350° Celsius. The mission aims to acquire images of galaxies, stars, planets, the Moon and Earth. The project will promote commercial access to the telescope use to schools, scientists and the public at large through the Internet.
Other two unrelated secondary payloads on the lander are a Celestis memorial, and a lunar laser ranging experiment called MoonLIGHT.

Carlton Terrace, Edinburgh

Carlton Terrace (known as Carlton Place from around 1830 until 1842) is a residential street in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located on the east side of Calton Hill, at the eastern extremity of the New Town, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1995. 
The street is in the form of an inverted crescent, a long, hairpin curved terrace of 19 classical town houses, linking together with Regent Terrace and Royal Terrace in a 'necklace' around the hill. Built on the west side of a setted street, the terrace faces sloping gardens descending down to Abbeyhill, across to Holyrood, and over to the heights of Arthur's Seat.
Residents enjoy access to Regent Gardens.
Architecture.
Design.
The Greek Revival architect William Henry Playfair designed Carlton Terrace in the 1820s, and a number of his original drawings, dating from 1821 to 1831, have survived in the Edinburgh University Library. An early drawing dated 1821 (number 1036) shows a design with rustication at ground floor level which was later discarded, and his final design emerged in a series of drawings done in 1825. 
Strongly influenced by ideas of the Picturesque, Playfair considered the individual characteristics of the site in making his design. Unlike Regent and Royal Terraces, there were no external columns or pilasters. However, like Regent Terrace, the buildings were two-storeyed with rectangular windows, with no rustication, and had identical fanlights to those in the other terrace (which can still be seen in six of the houses, the first five and number 8). 
The first four and the last six houses had straight 3-bay front elevations, but in the middle Playfair created nine wedge-shaped houses with curved 4-bay elevations. With three exceptions, the houses had balustraded parapets, a feature along Royal Terrace, but not used in Regent Terrace.
The houses are now all category A listed buildings.
Construction.
Based on a diagram of the development drawn by Playfair in 1831, we know that the terrace was feued by six builders, or sub-architects, who were on strict instructions to follow Playfair's precise design instructions. One of these, John Neill, responsible for numbers 5, 6, 16, 17 (and the respective mews), occupied the first completed house in 1830, which was number 17. Within the next six years, all the remaining houses were completed and occupied.
Former residents.
Listed by address:
Building use: townhouses to hotels and offices to flat conversions.
The terrace was designed as a series of individual townhouses, which they remained throughout the 19th century. Some of the households were large, and each included an average of three resident servants.
Following the social changes after the [[First World War]], up to half of the houses were turned into small private hotels, which in some cases lasted down to this century. Furthermore, from the 1930s, there were offices, including the Commissioner for Special Areas, followed by the [[Royal Observer Corps]] and the [[Scottish Office|Scottish Home Office]] in numbers 13 and 14. Towards the end of the 20th century, the South Edinburgh School of Nursing was at 15, 16, and 17 (still indicated by a marble step with Carlton House in black letters) and the Ingleby Gallery of modern art was at number 6. 
In 1934, the owner of number 13 asked the George Heriot Trust to change the title deeds in order to allow him to divide the property, the first attempt anywhere in the three terraces (Regent, Royal and Carlton) to create apartments. The case went to court and the application was refused.
Subsequently, the demand for smaller units became irresistible and many of the houses were indeed converted into residential flats. Today the street is entirely residential with no offices or hotels. Only four or five townhouses remain, the other houses being typically divided floor by floor, or in some cases an upper house on top of a separate basement and garden flat.
Carlton Terrace Mews.
[[File:Carltonterracemews April2017a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Carlton Terrace Mews in April 2017]]
Each Carlton Terrace townhouse was designed by Playfair to have its own stable [[mews]], 19 units for 19 houses, located in a circle within the bend of the road. This was unlike Regent and Royal Terrace which only had 22 mews for 74 townhouses. The units were feued, house by house with the terrace in the 1830s, but may have been built later.
Playfair stipulated the exact size of the mews before they were built. They were two-storey dwellings with horses and carriages below, and the coachmens' living accommodation above. During the early 20th century, the mews were converted into garages, and more recently some of the ground-floor garages have been turned into living accommodation. The mews have windows looking into the back street but not outwards towards the terrace. In the centre there is a shared garden, where an [[Air_raid_shelter#Anderson_shelter|Anderson air-raid shelter]] was located during the Second World War.

Lucile Buchanan

Lucile Berkeley Buchanan Jones (1884-1989) was the first Black woman to graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder. She graduated with a degree in German in 1918 and the Lucile Berkeley Buchanan Scholarship was created in her honor in April, 2010. Buchanan Jones is remembered for her "fierce independence, tenacity, and resolve".
Early life.
Lucy Berkeley Buchanan was born on June 13, 1884 to Sarah Lavina Bishop Buchanan and James Fenton Buchanan. Both of her parents had been born into slavery on Virginia plantations. Buchanan Jones claimed—and other evidence suggests—that Edmund Berkeley, the white slave owner of Sarah Bishop's plantation, was Sarah Bishop's father and Buchanan Jones's grandfather. “Lucy” was the name of one of Edmund Berkeley's white daughters. Her middle name “Berkeley” followed a Virginia tradition of naming a child for a parent or grandparent. Buchanan Jones later unofficially changed her name from Lucy to Lucile.
Buchanan Jones's parents married in November 1872 in Virginia. While still living in Virginia Sarah Bishop Buchanan gave birth to a daughter who died shortly after birth, and then to Hattie, Hannah, Laura, and her only son Fenton Mercer.
The Buchanans moved to Denver, Colorado in May 1882. They were the first Black family to own property in the Barnum subdivision. However, they did not move to Barnum until between 1886 and 1888 because of a lack of water, roads, transportation, postal service, churches, physicians, and shops.  The Buchanans constructed a five bedroom Queen Anne style house on the land which was still standing in 2018.
Lucy Berkeley Buchanan was the Buchanans’ first child born in Colorado. Four more children were born in Colorado: Sadie, Edith, Nellie and Claribel.
Education and career.
Buchanan Jones graduated from Villa Park High School in June 1901.  Following graduation she briefly worked as a substitute teacher at the high school, then for a publishing company and as a bookkeeper. 
Buchanan enrolled in a two-year teacher certification program at the now University of Northern Colorado in 1903 (then the Colorado State College for Education at Greeley). She was the only Black student in her 1905 graduating class and was the first Black student to earn a normal (teaching) degree there.  
After graduating from UNC Buchanan Jones unsuccessfully tried to get a teaching job in Colorado. She took a teaching job at Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock. She applied for a teaching job in Denver in 1908 but again was unsuccessful.  Buchanan Jones next taught at Langston High School, the only black high school in Hot Springs, Arkansas, between 1912 and 1915.
The following year, Buchanan enrolled at the University of Chicago to study Greek, German, and English, where she studied for a year before pursuing a degree in German at the University of Colorado Boulder. Buchanan was fluent in German and read Latin.
Buchanan Jones was the University of Colorado Boulder's first black female graduate in 1918. Although the classrooms at the University were integrated, school officials apparently did not want her to walk on stage to receive her diploma at the graduation ceremony in June 1918.  A woman was sent to her while she was sitting and waiting for her name to be called and told her “I’ll be your partner, Lucy”, then handed Buchanan Jones her diploma and disappeared. Buchanan Jones never went onstage at her own graduation ceremony. She vowed never to return to the University of Colorado, and never did.
She was not pictured in the university's yearbook in 1918, however she was pictured in a 1918 edition of "The Crisis," an official magazine of the NAACP. The university posthumously honored her on May 10, 2018, when Polly E. Bugros McLean accepted a diploma on Buchanan's behalf. McLean, an associate professor of media studies at the university, wrote a book about Buchanan titled "Remembering Lucile: A Virginia Family's Rise from Slavery and a Legacy Forged a Mile High", published in May 2018.
In 1919 Buchanan Jones took a position teaching English at the all-black Lincoln High School in Kansas City.  There she enjoyed attending baseball games and was one of the advisers for the local Junior Branch of the NAACP.  She created the World News Club for her students to discuss international events. In 1925 she created the school's first newspaper, the "Observer".  A student of hers who worked on the paper, Lucile Bluford, became one of the most highly recognized and respected journalists in Missouri as well as a leading voice in the civil rights movement.  
Buchanan Jones returned to Chicago in 1925 and obtained a teaching position at the Stephen A. Douglas School.  She spent the next 24 years teaching in the Chicago Public School System. During that period she enhanced her teaching skills by taking classes at the University of Chicago and the University of Denver.  She retired in 1949 at age 65, the mandatory retirement age for teachers.
Marriage and personal life.
Lucile Buchanan married John Dotha Jones in October 1926. Jones, who already had a degree from Columbia University and had enrolled in the graduate program at the University of Chicago, obtained employment at the US Postal Service.  Their marriage eventually fell apart and Jones left without notice on December 1, 1935. Buchanan Jones filed for a divorce which was granted in April 1940 on the grounds of adultery, extreme and repeated cruelty, willful desertion, and habitual drunkenness.  Nevertheless, Buchanan Jones continued to use her married name “Mrs. Jones” 46 years after the divorce.  
The shoes that she wore for her wedding, made by the Louvre Boot Company in Kansas City, Missouri, are at the Museum of Boulder.
With deep Baptist roots, Buchanan Jones became the first recording secretary of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.  
Buchanan Jones was a lifelong Republican, as were her parents and most blacks at the time. She cast her first vote for president in November 1920 and voted in 14 presidential elections.  She felt strongly that voting and freedom were tied together.  
Later life and death.
Following her retirement in 1949 Buchanan Jones returned to live in her family home in Denver with her brother Fenton. After Fenton died in 1963 a neighbor and friend of Fenton's, Herman Dick, became her driver and personal assistant. Later in life Buchanan Jones's eyesight and overall health deteriorated. In 1986 she was placed under the jurisdiction of the Colorado Department of Human Services, and on March 3 of that year, was physically restrained, removed from her home and taken to the Stovall Care Center.  She would never return home again. She died on November 10, 1989 at age 105. She was initially buried in an unmarked grave. Fred Walsen, a history buff, read about Buchanan Jones's burial the "Rocky Mountain News" and arranged to have her name added to her tombstone in 1998.

Bettmannsäge

Bettmannsäge is a village in the borough of Regen in the Bavarian Forest region of Germany. It has a population of about 150.
Location.
Bettmannsäge lies between Zwiesel and Regen on the railway line from Plattling to Bayerisch Eisenstein, the so-called Bavarian Forest Railway.
History.
The name of the village is derived from a large sawmill, which was built on the banks of the Black Regen. On 1 May 1898 it was given its own halt on the railway line. The sawmill was linked to the main line by a loading siding and a turntable was used to distribute the wagons to the various industrial sidings.
Because the owner of the sawmill was a Jew, the village was renamed during the Nazi era on 4 October 1936 to "Regentalsäge". On 14 May 1950 it was renamed to "Bettmannsäge". After the firm was wound up in 1950 the loading siding was lifted in 1951.
Bettmannsäge used to belong to the municipality of Rinchnachmündt and was incorporated with it as part of the municipal reforms on 1 May 1978 into the borough of Regen.

Libido is a 1965 B&amp;W Italian film co-written and co-directed by Ernesto Gastaldi and Vittorio Salerno, from a story by Mara Maryl (who was Ernesto Gastaldi's wife). It starred Giancarlo Giannini, Luciano Pigozzi, and Dominique Boschero.
Production.
"Libido" was filmed in only 18 days on a bet, according to Gastaldi He based the screenplay on a story idea by his wife Mara Maryl, who also had a co-starring role in the film. Gastaldi reused some footage from this film in his later 1982 horror film "Notturnno con grida".
The film's plot borrowed from both "Les Diaboliques" and Roger Corman's "Pit and the Pendulum", according to critic Adrian Luther Smith, who continued: "Despite the inevitable contstraints of the budget, "Libido" looks refreshingly sharp due to impressive B&amp;W photography (by Romolo Garroni) and some great locations."

Sam Moyer

Sam Moyer (born 1983, Chicago, Illinois) is an American artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Her work has been positioned alongside that of artists Mika Tajima, R. H. Quaytman, Cheyney Thompson, and Helen Frankenthaler.
Life and work.
Moyer received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Corcoran College of Art and Design and in 2007 she received her Master of Fine Arts from Yale University.
Her first solo gallery exhibition in 2008, at Cleopatra's gallery in Brooklyn, and it included work that incorporated moving blankets stretched like paintings onto stretcher bars—considering them part of an installation rather than individual paintings or works. Following a residency in Switzerland, the artist's interests shifted to focus on the "poetics of the found object" and she began making book sculptures. This then transitioned into working with fabric, which Moyer distorts by dyeing and bleaching it, as well as stone sourced from local marble yards and warehouses. She considers the stone an expansion of her vocabulary, elements of which are present in her earlier textile works. Moyer's expressionist pieces are said to defy the natural use of the materials she employs and to hold depth in their minimalist flatness that requires reflection in person rather than on the screen. The weight of the stone is said to become deceptively light on the artist's canvases, disrupting the "literal surface [with an] illusory space of uncertain, possibly infinite depth."
Exhibitions.
Moyer's work has been included in exhibitions including: "tc: temporary contemporary", Bass Museum, Miami Beach, Florida (2014), "Thread Lines", The Drawing Center, New York (2014), "Material Occupation", University of Albany Art Museum, Albany, New York (2012), "Greater New York", MoMA PS1, Queens, New York (2010), "Total Recall", Public Art Fund, MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, New York (2010), "Between Spaces", MoMA PS1, Queens, New York (2009), "If the Dogs are Barking", Artists Space, New York (2009), and "Dark Fair", Picture Box Inc., Swiss Institute, New York (2008).

Jennifer Dodds

Jennifer "Jenn" Dodds (born October 1, 1991 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish curler. She currently plays second on Team Eve Muirhead.
Career.
Dodds played second for the Hannah Fleming junior rink that won a silver medal at the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships. While attending Edinburgh College, Dodds played on Fleming's team at the 2013 Winter Universiade, placing fourth.
Dodds left the Fleming rink in 2014, playing third for Lauren Gray for two seasons. The team won the 2015 Dumfries Challenger Series event on the World Curling Tour. In 2016, she returned to the Fleming rink as her third. The team won the 2018 Scottish Women's Curling Championship and defeated the Eve Muirhead Olympic team for the right to represent Scotland at the 2018 World Women's Curling Championship. There, the team missed the playoffs with a 5–7 record. 
For the 2018–19 season, Dodds joined the Muirhead rink as third. At the first leg of the 2018–19 Curling World Cup, Dodds skipped the team due to Muirhead having a hip injury. They finished in sixth with a 2–4 record. She played in her first European Curling Championships at the 2018 European Curling Championships. There, the team had a disappointing performance, finishing with a 4–5 record, missing the playoffs. At the 2019 Scottish Women's Curling Championships, the team qualified for the final but lost to Sophie Jackson 11–7. In Grand Slam play, the team qualified for the playoffs in two of their three events with their best finish being at the Canadian Open where they lost in the semifinals.
Team Muirhead began the 2019–20 season by winning the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. At the 2019 European Curling Championships, the Muirhead rink reached the final where they lost to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg, claiming the silver medal. In early January, they won the Mercure Perth Masters. Team Muirhead claimed the 2020 Scottish Women's Curling Championship by defeating Maggie Wilson 8–3 in the championship game. The team was set to represent Scotland at the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship before the event got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Grand Slam play, they played in three events and qualified in one of them, the 2019 National where they lost in the quarterfinals to Jennifer Jones.
Due to the ongoing pandemic, there were a limited number of tour events held during the 2020–21 season. Team Muirhead did play in a series of domestic events put on by the British Curling Association, where they won the January Challenge event and finished runner-up to Team Gina Aitken in the Elite Finals. Dodds and her mixed doubles partner Bruce Mouat also won both mixed doubles events hosted by British Curling, which qualified to represent Scotland at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. A "curling bubble" was set up in Calgary, Canada in the spring, which hosted a number of events, including the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship and two slams. Team Muirhead competed in both the 2021 Champions Cup and the 2021 Players' Championship, failing to qualify at both events. The next week, the team represented Scotland at the World's, where they finished with a disappointing 6–7 record, in eighth place. Right after the World Championship, Dodds travelled back home to Aberdeen, Scotland to compete in the World Mixed Doubles with Mouat. There, the pair had a strong showing, finishing the round robin with an 8–1 record, earning them a direct bye to the semifinals. They then defeated Canada 7–4 in the semifinal and topped Norway 9–7 to claim the gold medal.
Personal life.
Before becoming a full-time curler, Dodds worked as an office assistant. Her cousin Abigail Brown won the 2012 World Junior championships.

A member of the Berlin Royal Opera, she was known for interpreting leading roles in operas by Gluck, singing in German with precise diction, and acting convincingly. She was a soloist at the coronation of Leopold II, with Mozart conducting.
Career.
Born Margarete Luise Hamel in Mainz, she was the daughter of the bassoonist Johann Nepomuk Hamel (1728–1792), who played for the elector Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal.

Laurence Waldron

Laurence Waldron (1811 – 3 April 1875) was an Irish Independent Liberal, Liberal and Whig politician. He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1857 to 1865 as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Tipperary.
Waldron married Anne White, daughter of Francis White. He had at least one son, Laurence Ambrose Waldron, who was an Irish Parliamentary Party MP for Dublin St Stephen's Green from 1904 to 1910.
Waldron first stood for Parliament as a Whig at a by-election in Tipperary, caused by the expulsion of James Sadleir from the House of Commons. Unsuccessful on this occasion, he was elected as a Whig for the same seat just a month later at the 1857 general election, holding the seat — standing as a Liberal in 1859 — until he stood down in 1865. Upon the death of John Blake Dillon in 1866, he stood for the seat again, this time as an Independent Liberal, but was unsuccessful.
He was also at some point a Deputy Lieutenant.

Work on the script went on for two and a half years. During this time, the authors interviewed a large number of girls and women who are concerned about the topic of losing weight, so that everything in the film is as truthful as possible. There were 17 draft scripts in total.
Filming.
The filming period was divided into two blocks. In the first block - May and June 2017 - Aleksandra Bortich was shot in full. After that, there was a break when Aleksandra Bortich switched to strict nutrition and trained 7 days a week. For a month and a half she lost weight and filming resumed.
Aleksandra Bortich herself performed many tricks in the film: she climbed from the balcony to the balcony on the eighth floor, jumped from the pier into the water at a temperature of less than 10 degrees, ran out of the burning bath in a burning sheet.
Criticism.
According to film critic Anton Dolin (), despite the predictable plot, overkill with views of the city to pop music and the not very appropriate role of Sergey Shnurov, all the "shortcomings are fully paid for by the merits" of the film.
Release.
The film was released in the Russian Federation by Universal Pictures International on March 8, 2018.
Reception.
The film received mostly positive reviews, acting of Bortich and the script received praise.
Box office.
The fees for the first day of rental amounted to 110 million rubles - as of mid-March this is the best achievement among Russian films in 2018, and for the first four days - up to 331 million rubles ($5.8 million), which brought the film to the ninth place of the weekly world rating. By early August, total fees exceeded 630 million rubles ($10 million).

Early life and education.
Bishop was born August 23, 1932, in Delta, Utah. He graduated from Delta High School in 1950 and served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Argentina. Bishop and Carolyn Callister married on June 28, 1956 and are the parents of five sons. Bishop earned a B.A. in Spanish in 1955 and an M.A. in Spanish in 1958, both from Brigham Young University (BYU). In 1958, Bishop earned a Ph.D. in university administration from Claremont Graduate School. In 1980 or 1981, Bishop was awarded an honorary doctorate of humanities from Weber State College (WSC), upon his retirement there.
Career.
From 1960 to 1961, Bishop was chairman of the Spanish department at Imperial Valley College. In 1961, he became president of the Haitian-American Institute, before becoming academic dean at Mt. San Jacinto College (1962–1966). Bishop later moved on to Prairie State College, where he served as vice president (1966–1968). From 1968–1972, Bishop was executive director of GT-70, an educational consortia made up of thirty U.S. colleges. In May 1972, Bishop was appointed president of WSC in Utah.
Under Bishop's leadership, the Dee Events Center was inaugurated. Some on the WSC staff felt he was condescending in his attitude towards staff.
The LDS Church assigned Bishop to serve as president of the Argentina Buenos Aires North Mission from 1978 to 1981. Bishop later served as president of the LDS Church's main site for training its missionaries, the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo, Utah, from 1983 to 1986. After 1986, Bishop was executive director of the BYU–Public School Partnership, where he coordinated the interface between five school districts and BYU's college of education.

Defendant in lawsuit alleging sexual abuse.
McKenna Denson, a woman alleged to have been sexually assaulted by Bishop in 1984, recorded an interview with him at a hotel conference room in Chandler, Arizona in December 2017, which was leaked to the public in March 2018. In the recording, Denson questions Bishop about their interactions in 1984 while he served as the president of the Provo MTC. In the recording, Bishop describes himself as a predator, a hypocrite, and a sex addict. After Denson spoke with BYU police in January 2018, the police interviewed Bishop. According to the BYU police department report, Bishop said he did not assault Denson; he asked Denson to show him her breasts during an encounter with her in his private preparation room, which she did. Local county prosecutor's office said it likely would have filed charges against Bishop based on Denson's allegations, however, the statute of limitations for rape in Utah in the 1980s was four years. In April 2018, Densen filed suit against Bishop and the LDS Church in federal court in Salt Lake City for redress concerning her mental, physical, and economic hardships as caused by the alleged sexual assault and battery, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, fraudulent nondisclosure and fraudulent concealment. On 10 December 2020, a federal judge terminated the case with prejudice.

Marcus Suillius Nerullinus

Marcus Suillius Nerullinus was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was consul "ordinarius" in the year 50 with Gaius Antistius Vetus as his colleague. 
Nerullinus was the son of Publius Suillius Rufus, who was suffect consul in 41 and a feared "delator". His mother was the stepdaughter of Ovid, but we are not told her name. Anne-Marie Lewis has argued this woman was not only the daughter of Paullus Fabius Maximus, consul in 11 BC, and the daughter (whose name we do not know) of Servius Sulpicus Rufus, the son of the homonymous orator and jurist, but she was also the stepdaughter of Marcia, second wife of Paullus, with whom she had an affectionate and long-lasting relationship. Suillius Caesoninus was his brother.
The wealth and power of his father facilitated Nerullinus' advancement through his senatorial career. However, when a number of "delatores", after successfully prosecuting his father for mismanagement while proconsular governor of Asia, they then attacked him "on the strength of men's hatred of the father and some charges of extortion. At that point the emperor Nero intervened and ended the prosecution, "as if implying that vengeance was fully satisfied."

Hudson County Executive

The County Executive of Hudson County, New Jersey, United States is the chief officer of the county's executive branch who oversees the administration of county government and works in collaboration with the nine-member Board of Chosen Freeholders, which acts in a legislative role. The New Jersey Superior Court had subsumed and replaced county courts in 1983. The office of the county executive is in the Hudson County Courthouse in the county seat, Jersey City.
The county executive is elected directly by the voters to a term of four years, which begins on January 1. At the 2010 United States Census, the county's population was 634,266. As of Election Day 2017 there were 348,366 registered voters in Hudson.

Theophilus MacCartan

Theophilus MacCartan (1700–1778) was an Irish Roman Catholic Prelate and Bishop of Down and Connor.
He served as Bishop of Down and Connor from 10/9/1760 until his death 16/12/1778.
MacCartan was a scion of a long established family McCartan in the wider Barony of Kinelarty, one of the seven baronies in County Down. It is the most central and contains the towns of Ballynahinch, Saintfield, Downpatrick, Clough, Dundrum, Newcastle and Castlewellan.
His early life and education took place against the backdrop of the Penal Laws and so firm details are scarce. But a generally respected source, writing at the end of the nineteenth century, asserts that the future bishop was born in Aughnagon near Mayobridge around 1700.
He was ordained priest at Ballykinlar by Bishop John Armstrong (1727-1739) and, as was often the case in the eighteenth century, was sent to study theology after ordination: in his case at the Sorbonne. Sometime around 1737 it is believed he was appointed parish priest of Loughinisland and erected the first church there.
Episcopal Ministry.
There is a record of the then bishop and his kinsman Dominic McCartan from Clonvarghan House each subscribing £5 so that the popular devotional book Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis could be translated into Irish. An early twentieth century account of the Bishops of Down and Connor suggests that Bishop MacCartan "always preached in Irish" and that it was during his episcopate that the first relaxation in the penal code was made. O'Laverty in his history of the diocese notes that MacCartan's sermons in Irish were remembered in the diocese for more than a generation after his death.
In 1773 he donated a chalice for use by any priest of the name McCartan, or the most senior priest of that name, in either the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dromore or his native Down and Connor. The chalice has been in continuous use since and there is a well-established historical record of the priests who have used this chalice.
His last will and testament has been preserved and much of the what is known about him and his episcopal ministry is drawn from that document drawn up days before his died. He is buried in Loughinisland, the parish which had been so central to his priestly and episcopal ministry.

Alex Stamos

Alex Stamos is a Greek American computer scientist and adjunct professor at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation. He is the former chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook. His planned departure from the company, following disagreement with other executives about how to address the Russian government's use of its platform to spread disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, was reported in March 2018.
Early life.
Stamos grew up in Fair Oaks, California and graduated from Bella Vista High School in 1997. Stamos attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated in 2001 with a degree in EECS.
Career.
Stamos began his career at Loudcloud and, later, as a security consultant at @stake.
iSEC Partners.
In 2004, Stamos co-founded iSEC Partners, a security consulting firm, with Joel Wallenstrom, Himanshu Dwivedi, Jesse Burns and Scott Stender. During his time at iSEC Partners, Stamos was well known for his research publications on vulnerabilities in forensics software and MacOS, Operation Aurora, and security ethics in the post-Snowden era.
Stamos was an expert witness for a number of cases involving digital privacy, encryption, and free speech:
iSEC Partners was acquired by NCC Group in 2010.
Artemis Internet.
Following the acquisition of iSEC Partners by NCC Group, Stamos became the CTO of Artemis Internet, an internal startup at NCC Group. Artemis Internet petitioned ICANN to host a '.secure' gTLD on which all services would be required to meet minimum security standards Artemis ultimately acquired the right to operate the '.trust' gTLD from Deutsche Post to launch its services.
Stamos filed and received five patents for his work at Artemis Internet.
Yahoo!
In 2014, Stamos joined Yahoo! as CSO. While at Yahoo!, he testified to Congress on online advertising and its impact on computer security and data privacy. He publicly challenged NSA Director Michael S. Rogers on the subject of encryption backdoors in February 2015 at a cybersecurity conference hosted by New America.
Facebook.
In 2015, Stamos joined Facebook as CSO. During his time at Facebook, Stamos co-authored a whitepaper (with Jen Weedon and Will Nuland) on the use of social media to attack elections. He later delivered a keynote address at the Black Hat Briefings in 2017 on the need to broaden the definition of security and diversify the cybersecurity industry.
Following disagreement with other executives about how to address the Russian government's use of its platform to spread disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he made plans in 2018 to leave the company to take a research professorship at Stanford University.
Stamos was interviewed about the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections in the PBS Frontline documentary "The Facebook Dilemma".
Controversies.
During Stamos's tenure as the Chief Security Officer, Facebook was involved in numerous safety and security controversies including the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, failure to remove reported child-abuse images, 
inaction against disinformation campaigns in Philipines that targeted and harassed journalists,
Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and the Rohingya genocide, for which the company has played a "determining role" according to the UN.
Stamos said, as the CSO during the 2016 election season he "deserve as much blame (or more) as any other exec at the company," 
for Facebook's failed response to the Russian interference.
Although the whitepaper Stamos coauthored
only mentioned $100,000 ad spend for 3,000 ads connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts, it was later revealed that
the Russian influence had reached 126 million Facebook users.
While Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 87 million Facebook users before Stamos's tenure, Facebook did not notify its users until 2018, despite knowing about it as early as 2015, the year Stamos joined the company as the CSO. In July 2019, Facebook agreed to pay $100 million to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
for misleading investors for more than two years (2015-2018) about the misuse of its users' data.
Stanford University.
, Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation lists Stamos as an adjunct professor, visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, and director of the Stanford Internet Observatory.
Krebs Stamos Group.

Conwy Town Council

Conwy Town Council is an elected community council serving the community of Conwy in Conwy County Borough, North Wales. As well as the old walled town of Conwy it represents the neighbouring towns of Deganwy and Llandudno Junction.
Background.
Conwy Town Council was formed in 1974 following local government reorganisation. The Council is made up of 17 town councillors elected from five community wards, namely Castle, Aberconwy, Deganwy, Marl and Pensarn.
The Council elects a mayor every year, who performs a ceremonial role and is also Constable of Conwy Castle. Following the May 2012 elections the town appointed London-born Cedric Rigal as its first Jewish mayor, with a rabbi reciting a prayer at the mayoral inauguration.
In 2015 the town council made the news when it appointed an official town jester to entertain the locals and visitors. Erwyd le Fol had been a professional juggler and entertainer for 15 years and, as part of his costume, was given a special hat with donkey ears. He was the first jester-in-residence for the town since the 13th-century. The jester was officially appointed at a naming ceremony on 2 August 2015.

Biblical Researches in Palestine

Biblical researches in Palestine, Mount Sinai and Arabia Petraea (1841 edition), also Biblical Researches in Palestine and the Adjacent Regions (1856 edition), was a travelogue of 19th-century Palestine and the magnum opus of the "Father of Biblical Geography", Edward Robinson. The work was published simultaneously in England, the United States (dedicated to Moses Stuart) and Germany (dedicated to Carl Ritter).
The work identified numerous Biblical localities for the first time, as well as significant Jerusalem archaeological sites such as Robinson's Arch (subsequently named for the author), and undertook the first scientific surveys of other sites such as the Siloam tunnel.
Robinson received a Royal Geographical Society Gold Medal as a result of his work.
Field work.
Robinson made two journeys to Palestine. The first began on 12 March 1838 in Cairo, reached Jerusalem on 14 April, toured Arabia Petrea in May, arrived in Nazareth on 17 June, and ended in Beirut on 27 June; The second began on 5 April 1852 in Beirut, where he arrived back again 19 June 1852 having explored much of Northern Palestine.
Legacy.
The work has been described as a "cornerstone of nineteenth century Palestine exploration". Earlier descriptions had relied on the accounts of travellers and legends, whereas Robinson and his guide and translator Eli Smith relied on only what they saw for themselves.
Albrecht Alt described the work as "epoch-making", and in describing the influence of the work in dispelling previously accepted knowledge of the region, stated: "he was able definitively to disprove a large part of what his predecessors had thought and had written. In Robinson's footnotes are forever buried the errors of many generations".
Professor Thomas W. Davis noted that "all later archaeological research in Palestine is in some way indebted to [Robinson]. His geographical study marked a new era".
In a study of nineteenth century Biblical Studies in the United States, Jerry Wayne Brown described Robinson's work as "the most significant piece of American Biblical scholarship before the Civil War".

Laura Barquero

Laura Barquero (born 12 October 2001) is a Spanish pair skater. With her skating partner, Marco Zandron, she is the 2021 CS Nebelhorn Trophy silver medalist and the 2021 Spanish national champion.
With her former skating partner, Tòn Cónsul, she is the 2020 Spanish national champion and competed in the final segment at the 2020 European Championships. With her former skating partner, Aritz Maestu, she is the 2018 Toruń Cup champion and 2018 International Challenge Cup champion, and competed for Spain at two World Championships. 
Career.
Early years.
Barquero began learning to skate in 2009. As a single skater, she trained under Marta Senra and Ainhoa Gimeno in Madrid, Spain. She competed on the junior level and received one ISU Junior Grand Prix assignment, in September 2016.
Barquero's first pair skating partner was Miguel Taranco. They made no international appearances together.
2016–2017 season.
Barquero and Aritz Maestu announced their partnership on 4 January 2017. They decided to train in Bergamo, Italy, coached by Barbara Luoni and Franca Bianconi. During their first season together, the pair was ineligible for international competitions due to the ISU's age requirements – Barquero was too young for senior events and Maestu too old for juniors.
2017–2018 season.
Making their international debut, Barquero/Maestu placed seventh at the 2017 CS Lombardia Trophy in mid-September. At the end of the month, they placed thirteenth at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, the final qualifying opportunity for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Although their placement was not sufficient to qualify, Spain became the third alternate for a spot in the Olympic pairs' event.
In January, Barquero/Maestu placed eleventh at the 2018 European Championships in Moscow, Russia. The following month, they won gold at the Toruń Cup in Toruń, Poland, and at the International Challenge Cup in The Hague, Netherlands. They concluded the season at the 2018 World Championships, in twentieth place.
2018–2019 season.
Barquero/Maestu began the season with two Challenger assignments, finishing fifth at the 2018 CS Lombardia Trophy and eighth at the 2018 CS Finlandia Trophy. Making their Grand Prix debut with two assignments, they were seventh at the 2018 Grand Prix of Helsinki and sixth at 2018 NHK Trophy. At the 2019 European Championships they were seventh, after taking their second consecutive national title. Their final event together was the 2019 World Championships, where they placed fifteenth.
On May 31, 2019, it was announced that Maestu had suffered an injury that would involve a prolonged recovery, and in consequence of this the team had split.
2019–2020 season.
In July 2019, Barquero teamed up with Tòn Cónsul.
The team made their international debut at the Denis Ten Memorial Challenge, where they won the silver medal. They continued their season at the IceLab International Cup, where they won bronze. At the 2019 CS Warsaw Cup, they were fourth. Their last competition before Nationals was the 2019 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb, where they were eighth. At their first Spanish Nationals, they won their first National title. 
They competed at the 2020 European Championships, where they placed fourteenth. They went on to compete at the International Challenge Cup, where they placed ninth. They were named to the team for the 2020 Worlds, but the competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 26 June 2020, it was announced that the pair had split after only one season together.
2020–2021 season.
Barquero formed a new partnership with Italian pairs skater Marco Zandron, and in January of 2021 they were formally cleared to represent Spain. They won the Spanish national title in their first outing together, but did not compete internationally during the season.
2021–2022 season.
Barquero/Zandron made their international debut on the Challenger series at the 2021 Lombardia Trophy. They were second in the short program and won the free skate, taking the silver medal overall and finishing less than four points behind Italian national champions Della Monica/Guarise. They were next assigned to the 2021 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, attempting to qualify a berth for Spain at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Third in the short program, they won the free skate despite two jump errors, taking the silver medal overall and the first of three pairs berths available at the event. This was the first time a Spanish pair had qualified to the Winter Olympics. Barquero said she was "proud" of their work, while Zandron said he was confident that he would acquire Spanish citizenship in time to attend the Games.

Louise Vanderbilt

Louise Holmes Anthony Vanderbilt (September 4, 1854 – August 21, 1926) was an American heiress and socialite. Her philanthropist causes included educational opportunities and entertainments for the local community near her Hyde Park, New York home, the annual Thanksgiving dinner for the newsboys in Newport, Rhode Island, several New York City based charities, and the Anthony Home which she founded in 1913.
Early life.
Louise was born Louisa Holmes Anthony on September 4, 1854, probably in Brooklyn, New York. She was the youngest daughter of Catherine (née Holmes) Anthony (1824–1882) and Charles Lee Anthony (d. 1874), both of whom were born in Rhode Island. Louise had two sisters, Rosalie DeWolf (1844–1929), who married William Post, and Catherine "Kate" Lee (1845–1907), who married Henry Anthon Heiser.
Her father was a socially prominent and wealthy dry-goods merchant in New York City under the firm name of Anthony &amp; Hall. Among her extended family members were nieces Rose Post Howard, who married Thomas H. Howard (a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant), and Margaret Van Alen Bruguiére, who married James Laurens Van Alen (a grandson of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor).
Personal life.
In 1868, Louise married Alfred Torrance (1852–1887), the son of Daniel Torrance and Sophia Johnson (née Vanderbilt) Torrance. His sisters were Adelaide Torrance, who married Meredith Howland, and Marie Torrance, who married John A. Hadden Jr. Alfred, a grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, was a horseman of some reputation in London, Paris, and New York. She divorced Torrance in 1877.
The following year on December 17, 1878, Louise married Torrance's cousin Frederick William Vanderbilt (1856–1938), son of William Henry Vanderbilt and Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt. Apparently wed in secret, the marriage was the subject of some gossip. The "New-York Daily Tribune" reported her father-in-law's displeasure upon hearing of the secret marriage, noting they were "debarred of the parental mansion and deprived of the parental blessing." This reaction may have been overstated. Frederick's father later left the couple his home located at 459 Fifth Avenue.
Louise died at the Hotel Ritz in Paris on August 21, 1926 following "a short illness caused by complications setting in from a slight throat infection." Frederick returned to the United States with Louise's body aboard the White Star Liner "Homeric." A section of the baggage room on the lower deck was made into a chapel with wreaths, floral arrangements, and the spiral staircase leading to it draped with black. She was interred in the Vanderbilt family mausoleum at Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island.
Residences.
During their marriage, which lasted nearly fifty years, Louise and Frederick made their New York City home at several locations. They also built "Rough Point" in Newport, Rhode Island, "Pine Tree Point" on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks, and "Hyde Park" in Hyde Park, New York. In 1919, Louise purchased "Sonogee" at Bar Harbor, Maine.
Legacy.
Record of Louise's generosity is consistently noted by those who knew her. Friends and employees remembered her as generous and kind. Her generosity toward the Village of Hyde Park is documented in oral interviews recorded by the National Park Service. Louise provided educational opportunities and entertainments for the young men and women of the village. She established a reading room, attached to St. James' Chapel, sponsored lectures at the Town Hall, established a young man's club room in the village, and brought the Red Cross to Hyde Park in 1911. In 1917, she was largely responsible for establishing the District Health Nurse in Hyde Park. During World War I, she joined wealthy neighbors to equip, clothe, and arm a Hyde Park Home Defense Company of sixty-five men. Employees reported that Louise knew almost every family in Hyde Park and through her agents often helped families in need, struggling with health or financial difficulties. She provided entertainments for village residents and their children, including ice cream festivals and, on at least one occasion, a steamer cruise on the Hudson River for all 700 residents of the village. She was known to distribute Christmas gifts to the children of Hyde Park. 
At Newport, she sponsored an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the newsboys and messenger boys from 1891 to 1925. Usually 350 to 400 boys attended the dinner, entering the hall to orchestra music. On occasion, Louise attended the dinner. At her Newport home Rough Point, she hosted a Lawn Fete for the benefit of the Newport Society for the Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis.
Charities that benefited from her will at the time of her death included legacies in the sum of $10,000 each bequeathed to the New York Orthopedic Dispensary and Hospital, the Woman's Hospital, the Children's Aid Society, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Stanton Street Helping Hand Association, and the New York Women's League for Animals, Inc. The largest single bequest was $300,000, to establish a trust fund for her Anthony Home, Inc., a model residential building for working women.
Frederick inherited some of Louise's jewelry and Sonogee, her house at Bar Harbor, Maine. The bulk of her estate was bequeathed to her two nieces and her sister. Other friends and employees inherited bequests of various amounts. Her estate was estimated at more than $1,000,000.

Thomas Hertog

Thomas Hertog is a Belgian cosmologist at KU Leuven university and a key collaborator of Professor Stephen Hawking.
Early life.
Thomas Hertog was born on 27 May 1975. He graduated Summa cum laude from KU Leuven in 1997 with an MSc degree in physics. He obtained his Master's degree at the University of Cambridge in Part III of the Mathematical Tripos and obtained a Ph.D. degree at Cambridge with a thesis on the origins of cosmic expansion under the supervision of Stephen Hawking.
Career.
Hertog had the opportunity to conduct research with Stephen Hawking in the field of cosmic inflation, a branch of the Big Bang theory.
He then worked as a researcher at the University of California - Santa Barbara in the United States and the Université de Paris VII in France. He became a fellow at CERN in Geneva in 2005. In October 2011, Hertog was appointed professor at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at KU Leuven through the Odysseus program of the Flemish government. He led a research group studying the relationship between the Big Bang and string theory, with the idea that concepts like space and time lose their meaning. He also emphasized Georges Lemaître's insight that the Big Bang is central to Einstein's gravitational waves. Hertog worked in the field of quantum cosmology and string theory with James Hartle and Stephen Hawking. In 2011, after years of research, they came to a new insight by combining the mathematics of quantum cosmology and that of string theory.

Chak Ngaeo

Chak Ngaeo or Ban Chak Ngaeo (or spelled: "Chakngeaw"; ; lit: "Chak Ngaeo Village"; ; pinyin: "Chá gé") is a community and village located in Tambon Huai Yai, Bang Lamung District, Chonburi Province, eastern Thailand. It is a community of Thai Chinese who still maintain the traditional lifestyle similar to Talad Noi in Bangkok. Even though it is located less than 10 kilometers (6.21 mi) from Pattaya, where Pattaya is a world-class tourist destination filled with pubs, bars or liquor stores includes agogo bars and many Western tourists. It has been dubbed "Chinatown of the East".
History.
Chak Ngaeo has a long history of not less than 200 years. The geography of the community consists of plains surrounded by hills or rolling plains, swamps, canals, and the distance from the seashore is only 8–9 km (4.9–5.5 mi) away, so there are abundant soil, water and forest resources. Thailand's famous poet Sunthorn Phu (สุนทรภู่) wrote about Chak Ngaeo in his "Journey to Muang Klaeng" (นิราศเมืองแกลง) in the year of 1807 (the end of the reign of King Rama I in the early Rattanakosin) during a visit to his father in Muang Klaeng (now Amphoe Klaeng), Rayong province. When he arrived here in the nightfall and have called "Nong Cha Ngaeo" (หนองชะแง้ว; Cha Ngaeo Marsh).
According to the above literature, it can be assumed that "Chak Ngaeo" originated "Cha Ngae" (ชะแง้) which means raising head to look, you must raise your head while looking because the community was located on low plains surrounded by hills. Another assumption is "Chak" means flood plains or scrub forests, maybe forests which re-grow after being cut, "Ngaeo" comes from "Ngew" (งิ้ว; cotton trees) because cotton trees can be widely seen in this area.
In the before 1960s, not long ago. Chinese immigrants (mostly Teochew) who came to live in Thailand. They have settled here and have grown cassava roots. There are 13 tapioca flour mills. There are two cinemas, one of which has a chair with 1,000 seats, including there is a bus terminus. The famous singer of that era went from Bangkok for shows in here, such as Suraphol Sombatcharoen or Waiphot Phetsuphan. It is considered that the Chak Ngaeo is prosperous before Pattaya and resulting in a mixture of traditional Thai culture and Chinese culture.
Later, Chak Ngaeo has stagnated when Pattaya has prospered respectively. People have migrated to new places.
Presently.
Currently, Chak Ngaeo has been promoted as a cultural attraction since 2012 by organization under the Office of the Prime Minister. It is surrounded by two storey traditional wooden shophouses with balconies in consecutive. The center of community is also the site of the Mazu Shrine or "Chaomae Thapthim" (เจ้าแม่ทับทิม) in Thai, the goddess of the sea, fishery and seafaring according to the belief of Chinese. It is respected by the people in the congregation as well as in neighbouring communities.
Every Saturday from 3 pm until about 9 pm, locals will open the traditional market in the form of pedestrian mall. There are various products available, especially many rare foods both Thai and Chinese food. There is also "Chak Ngaeo Rama", the original wooden cinema that remains to the present.
Besides, not far from here there is also another old community "Takian Tia" (ตะเคียนเตี้ย), a community with a traditional Thai lifestyle.

Inghimasi

Inghimasi (, "become immersed"), also called shahid (, "martyr") and istishhadi (, "martyrdom seeker"), are forlorn hope or suicide attack shock troops utilized by several jihadist Sunni Islamist militant groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Qaeda, Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra), Boko Haram, and al-Shabaab.
Definition and etymology.
Inghimasi are usually well-trained guerrilla fighters who are organized into teams, and infiltrate enemy positions in order to cause as much damage as possible, generally expecting to be killed while doing so. They often wear explosive belts that are to be detonated when the possibility arises that they could be captured, run out of ammunition, or expect to be overwhelmed. Inghimasi fighters usually wear clothing resembling that of the target's forces, and use light weapons. Inghimasi have to agree to a 'no return' policy, and expect to die in combat. Unlike normal suicide attack forces, however, an Inghimasi can survive their missions and return to their base. The Islamic State gives new recruits the option of becoming an Inghimasi when enlisting, along with the option of operating a SVBIED or being a regular fighter. The word comes from the Arabic word "Inghamasa" (انغمس) meaning "to plunge" or "become immersed".
History.
Arabic media outlets first reported of Inghimasis in 2013; however, its use on social media originates to 2011, the origin of the Inghimasi concept is attributed to al-Nusra. As the Inghimasi concept is attributed to al-Nusra, founded as the Syrian branch of the Islamic State of Iraq in early 2012, this method of attack became prominent during the Syrian Civil War and eventually the 2014-2017 Iraqi Civil War but the usage of Inghimasi tactics have also been used during the Second Libyan Civil War. Notable uses of Inghimasi operations include the Battle of Al-Tabqa airbase, the Siege of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, the 2016 Battle of Kirkuk, and various times during the 2012-2016 Battle of Aleppo such as during the Aleppo offensive in October and November 2016.
The Inghimasi method of attack is not unique to the Middle East, and has been used in terrorist attacks outside the region. Al-Shabaab in Somalia is known to employ Inghimasis, and the Islamic State's branch in Afghanistan uses them as well. Furthermore, the individuals involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks operated in a similar fashion to Inghimasi.

Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (1775)

The Raid on Yarmouth took place on 5 December 1775 during the American Revolutionary War. The raid involved American Privateers from Salem, Massachusetts attacking Yarmouth, Nova Scotia at Cape Forchu. The privateers intended to stop the export of supplies being sent from Nova Scotia to the loyalists in Boston.
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. Sent to join Captain Jeremiah O'Brien in the Bay of Fundy, five vessels left Salem for Nova Scotia. The schooners took four prizes in the Bay of Fundy and sent three to Salem. Two of the schooners went to Yarmouth. One of these schooners had prisoner Acting-Governor Phillips Callbeck, having been captured in the Raid on Charlottetown (1775).
Battle.
On December 5, 1775 at 10:00 in the morning two American Privateers (80 men each) from Salem, each armed with eight Carriage guns and 16 swivels, landed at Yarmouth. The crew had fire locks, pistols and cutlasses. They overwhelmed the local militia and imprisoned all the officers. Under threat of death, the inhabitants of the town watched as the privateers pillaged their town. As a result, 82 inhabitants of Yarmouth signed a petition to Governor Legge to either withdraw to Halifax or New England or be able to remain neutral in the conflict, which was quickly rejected by Richard Bulkeley.
Aftermath.
American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. The attacks put an end to the trade relations between Nova Scotia and New England. For example, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, American privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.

Jenny Sabin

Jenny E. Sabin (born 1974) is an American architect, designer and artist who draws upon biology and mathematics to design material structures. Sabin is the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Wiesenberger Professor of Architecture in the Department of Architecture at Cornell University. She focuses on design and emerging technologies, with particular emphasis on the areas of computational design, data visualization and digital fabrication.
Career.
Sabin completed both Bachelor of Fine Arts and Bachelor of Arts degrees at the University of Washington in 1998.
After working by day (as director of admissions at the Seattle Art Museum) and by night (in the studio) for several years, Sabin returned to school, completing a Masters in Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005.
As of 2005, Sabin became the principal investigator of the Jenny Sabin Studio in Philadelphia.
As a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006, Sabin co-founded the Sabin+Jones LabStudio with Peter Lloyd Jones, a spatial biologist and pathologist. The studio focused on multi-disciplinary research and design, enabling architects, mathematicians, biologists and other scientists to apply ideas from biological systems to the ecological design of architecture.
Using the organizational structures of cells as inspiration, Sabin designed networks of sheets, tubes, and larger forms based on simple mathematical rules, to explore the aggregation of parts in greater wholes.
As of 2011, Sabin joined the Department of Architecture at Cornell University, and established the Sabin Design Lab at Cornell and the Jenny Sabin Studio in Ithaca.
Sabin is the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Wiesenberger Professor and the Director of Graduate Studies in Architecture. Sabin is involved in expanding the degree program to offer a degree in Architectural Science with a focus on Matter Design Computation.
“Digital ceramics” classes explore the generative fabrication of a wide variety of materials, and interest students from biology and biomedicine as well as architecture. Students use computers and 3D-printers to "sketch" their ideas, experimenting with powders for high-firing stoneware, and mixtures of powdered dry clay and organic materials. Students are faced with the experience of productive failure as they test their ideas. One student described it as “terrifying,” because of the “unforgiving nature of clay as a design material.”
Works.
In 2011, Sabin created the Greenhouse and Cabinet Of Future Fossils as part of "The Greenhouse Projects" at the American Philosophical Society Museum.
The structure contained 110 removable and portable cold frames, required no electricity and was built of recyclable materials. In addition to edible and ornamental plants, the installation contained 3D-printed "artifacts" in its fossil cabinets.
Sabin's hanging structure "PolyMorph" (2013), on permanent installation at the FRAC Centre in France, is made up of 1400 hollow ceramic modules held together with stainless steel cables. The completed piece weighs more than .
Contra-molds and two-part plaster molds for each piece were 3D-printed, but the final ceramic pieces were individually slip-cast by two ceramicists, in a process that was "very slow and analog, and very much about the hand". 
Modules, molds and drawings from the process and design stages of the work were part of the exhibition "A Tipping Point: Technology in Ceramics", at the Northern Clay Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2016, Sabin created a polythread knitted textile pavilion for the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, as part of the Emergent sector of the “Beauty—Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial”. The temporary structure was lightweight, portable, and photoluminescent.
Sabin's design was applauded by the Cooper Hewitt as being at the "forefront of a new direction for twenty-first-century architectural practice".
On June 29, 2017, Sabin's immersive installation "Lumen" debuted at MoMA PS1 as part of the Young Architects Program. It was commissioned through the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 and developed by Sabin and members of the Sabin Design Lab at Cornell. 
The installation consists of a knitted canopy of cells and tubes that respond to changes in sunlight and heat. The knitted structures making up the installation were made of solar active yarns that absorb light during the day and release it at night. The installation includes a misting system to cool visitors. Sean Anderson, one of the international competition's jury, said that the “catalytic immersive environment … captured the jury’s attention for imaginatively merging public and private spaces”.
In 2018, Sabin and collaborator Mariana Bertoni received a Frontiers of Engineering grant from the Grainger Foundation to explore the emergent design and fabrication of solar panels.
Sabin's works are included in collections of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in Washington, D.C., Centre national des arts plastiques in Paris,
Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and the FRAC Centre in Orléans, France.
Awards.
In 2010, Sabin received a Pew Fellowship in the Arts for work in architecture and design.
In 2011, Sabin was chosen to receive a United States Artists (USA) Knight Fellowships for architecture and design.
In 2015, Sabin received The Architectural League Prize for Young Architects from the Architectural League of New York.

American Flyer (railcar)

The American Flyer was an early streamlined American passenger railcar built by Pullman-Standard in the 1930s. They were the first streamlined equipment operated in New England and acquired their name from the model trains that their design inspired.
Characteristics.
American Flyer railcars weighed about 55 tons and were built out of light-weight steel alloys such as Cor-Ten that made them about 15 tons lighter than earlier designs and allowed for the use of two-axle General Steel Castings trucks instead of the previously standard three-axle designs. They were designed by Walter Dorwin Teague, and the first order for 50 coaches, with an 84 passenger capacity, was placed by the New Haven Railroad with Pullman-Standard in March 1934. Built at the former Osgood Bradley Car Company facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, these cars were delivered starting in December 1934, and were followed by 20 more in 1936 and 30 in 1938 in an identical configuration. In 1937 and 1938, 100 more coaches in a 92 passenger configuration for commuter service were delivered.
Production.
In 1935, the Boston and Maine Railroad ordered ten 84-seat and twenty-one 98-seat coaches, followed in 1937 by twenty 92-seat coaches. The Bangor and Aroostook Railroad acquired nine cars of the American Flyer design in 1937 and 1938—four combination mail and baggage cars, three combination food service and coach cars, and two 84-seat coaches. Outside New England, ten American Standard cars were purchased by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, ten by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, ten by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and four by the Kansas City Southern Railway. Production ceased by the end of the 1930s.
In preservation.
Two examples of the type, both New Haven Railroad coaches, were purchased by the Railroad Museum of New England for preservation.

Mads Christian Holm

Mads Christian Holm (19 October 1827 - 23 September 1892) was a Danish shipbuilder and ship-owner. He founded the shipping company D/S Norden in Copenhagen in 1861 and Helsingør Dockyard in Helsingør in 1882. He is also remembered for his charitable donations to the church, an orphanage and a school in his home town Nykøbing Mors.
Early life and education.
Holm was born in Nykøbing Mors, the illegitimate son of Maren Nielsdatter (1794–1854). His father is in the church records listed as servant Esper (Esben) Nielsen (1795–1880) but may have been a district bailiff ("by- og hjerredsfoged") and justice councilor named Rummelhoff. Either way. Esper Nielsen ended up marrying a well-to-do widow of a farmer, leaving Maren Nielsdatter and her son in very poor circumstances. Mads Christian frequently had to go out begging to get food on the table. He assumed the surname Holm after his mother married ship carpenter Lars Christensen Holm (1812–53) in 1838. After completing an apprenticeship as a ship carpenter in Thisted, following in his step father's footsteps, he worked on shipwarfs in Aalborg and Helsingør.
Years abroad.
Holm enrolled on a barque bound for Boston. He then continued to San Francisco before, in 1854, founding a shipyard in Oakland, California, which specialized in revamping abandoned ships. He left it in the trust of his partner to return to Europe about one year later. His intention at that point was to return to America after visiting the exposition Universelle in Paris and his home country.
Career in Denmark.
Back in Denmark, Holm initially visited his home town Nykøbing Mors. After a while he ended up leasing a shipyard in Åbenrå in a business partnership with sea captain Bot Bendixen (1792–1861).
In 1862 he moved to Copenhagen to study business at the Business College. In January 1871, he successfully invited interested investors to participate in a share subscription for a steam ship for tramp service, leading to the foundation of D/S Norden on 11 February 1871. "Norden", an ironbuilt screw steamer with a load capacity of one thousand tons deadweight, was launched from Aitken &amp; Mansel at Glasgow in February 1872. Holm headed the company until his death in 1892 and its fleet had by then grown to five ships.
He established Helsingør Jernskibs- og Maskinbyggeri in Helsingør in 1882. Carl Frederik Tietgen had tried to obstruct the plans.
Personal life and legacy.
Holm had a relationship to a girl named Arlette Lund during his years in Aalborg. In 1851 it resulted in a son, Ferdinand Jorgen Peter Holm, but Arlette Lund's parents, who were wealthy restaurateurs, would not let their daughter marry him. Holm later wrote her many letters but she ended up marrying another man. After his return from America, in 1861, Holm married Emilie Bendixen (30 May 183? - 27 August 1914), a daughter of captain Boy Bendixen, his collaborator in Åbenrå. They lived in Nyhavn after moving to Copenhagen.
He made several large donations to the church, a children's asylum and a new school in Nykøving Mors. The school is still named M. C. Holms Skole ("M. C. Holm's School") after him. The local Free Masons Lodge is also named Lodge No. 67 "M. C. Holm" after him.
Holm died on 23 September 1892 from appendicitis. He is buried in Nykøbing Mors Cemetery. Peter de Nelly Brown took over the management of the company after Holm's death. The company's next new ship was named "M.C. Holm" in 1894.

The Future of Work and Death

The Future of Work and Death is a 2016 documentary by Sean Blacknell and Wayne Walsh about the growth of exponential technology.
The film showed at several film festivals including Raindance Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Academia Film Olomouc and CPH:DOX.
In May 2017 it received an official screening at the European Commission. It was distributed by First Run Features and Journeyman Pictures and was released on iTunes, Amazon Prime and On-demand on 9 May 2017. The film was made available on Sundance Now on 27 November 2017. A companion piece to the film, The Cost of Living, a documentary concerning basic income in Britain, was released on Amazon Prime October 8, 2020.
Synopsis.
World experts in the fields of futurology, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy consider the impact of technological advances on the two 'certainties' of human life; work and death. Charting human developments from "Homo habilis", past the Industrial Revolution, to the digital age and beyond, the film looks at the shocking exponential rate at which mankind has managed to create technologies to ease the process of living.
As we embark on the next phase of our adaptation, with automation and artificial intelligence signifying the complete move from man to machine, the film asks what the implications are for human fulfilment in an approaching era of job obsolescence and extreme longevity.

The Kensington Club

The Kensington Club is a private all-male dining club for students of the University of St Andrews.
History.
The details of the foundation of the Kensington Club are opaque. The Club’s own histories maintain that the Club was founded by Alexander, the Laird of Balgonie in the year 1739. While Alexander Laird Balgonie was indeed a historical figure, the extant family seat of Castle Balgonie being only 30 miles from the town of St Andrews, it is difficult to confirm the account of the often self-referential ‘club histories’ with confirmatory independent documentary evidence. 
The club was certainly founded prior to the appearance of the “Kensington Song” in a publication of 1792 (see below). The epithet then given to it as “celebrated” suggests that the Club was founded some significant time earlier, giving credence to the possibility that the legend surrounding Alexander Balgonie is true. Further evidence of this can be found in the lyric of the song, which opens with a direct reference to “Balgonie of Fife”.
The etymology of the Club’s name remains unclear. There are three theories as to its origin: 1. It is a corruption or anglicisation of the Scots name of the town of ‘Kennoway’/‘Kennoton’, a town in Fife less than two miles from Castle Balgonie; 2. It is a corruption or anglicisation of the old Scots term ‘keest-an-ton’ meaning ‘a vigorous shout or hunting cry’; and 3. There is some suggestion in the Club’s own history that ‘Kensington’ may have been the name of a mutually funded race horse owned by the club at some point in its early history.The evidence for the continued activities of the club are unsurprisingly scanty in the historical record. A print collection of 1814, by an anonymous Frenchman, contains a plate which is generally supposed to show the Kensington Club at dinner, entitled “L’Après Dinée des Écossais - Scenes á St Andrewes”. The engraving depicts seven men in matching maroon tailcoats in the later throws of a drunken dinner party (maroon and green being the club colours).
After the Second World War the Kensington Club entered a period of decline. It is not clear if the club was dormant or not, and the issue is hotly contested. It is generally accepted that the Club was re-constituted in its current form in the 1970s.
In 2001 Raymond, the present Laird of Balgonie, was given honorary membership and made the club patron.
Activities.
Private dinners for club members are held biweekly. Etiquette and manners are enforced on the penalty of port.
Kensington Club Song.
“The Kensington Song”, also known by its incipit “To Balgonie of Fife”, is the official song of the Kensington Club. The song bears extremely close relations to “The Anacreontic Song”, and it seems likely that it is an altered version of that original text. The Anacreontic song was also used by several other clubs and societies in altered form, eventually being combined with patriotic lyrics and adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America in 1931.
The date of the composition of the Song is uncertain. It cannot predate the composition of the Anacreontic Song, which is generally supposed to have been December 1773. The "Kensington lyrics" of the song were included in "Songs and Anthems for the Piano Forte, Harpsichord and Voice", published in 1792. This publication does not name the composer.
Lyrics.
1To Balgonie of Fife, where he sat in full Glee,
A few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition,
That he their Inspirer and Patron would be;
When this answer arriv’d from the jolly old clansman
“Voice, Fiddle and Flute,
“No longer be mute,
“I’ll lend you my Name and inspire you to boot,
“And, besides I’ll instruct you, like me, to intwine
“The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus’s Vine.”2Ye sons of the Kensington, join Hand in Hand;
Preserve Unanimity, Friendship and Love!
'Tis yours to support what's so happily planned.
You’ve the sanction of Gods, and the Fiat of Jove.
While thus we agree,
Our Toast let it be:
May our Club flourish happy, united and free!
As here, with good Fellows, we learn to intwine
The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus’s Vine.

Ronald Mace

Ronald Lawrence Mace, FAIA (1941 – June 29, 1998) was an American architect, product designer, educator, and consultant. He is best known for coining the term universal design and for his work advocating for people with disabilities.
Early life and education.
Ronald L. Mace was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was the youngest of 2 children. In 1950, at the age of nine, he contracted polio, which led to him spending a year in the hospital. After contracting polio, he used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
Mace studied architecture at the North Carolina State University's School of Design, where he encountered inaccessible facilities that limited his ability to use campus facilities. He graduated with a degree in architecture in 1966.
Architectural and design career.
After his graduation, Mace worked for four years as an architect before becoming involved in advocacy for accessibility in building design. He was instrumental in North Carolina’s March 13, 1973, adoption of Chapter 11X, which was the first accessibility-focused building code to be adopted in the United States. This code served as a model for other states and was one of the foundations of the later movement to pass federal legislation prohibiting disability discrimination, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. He also worked on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Mace was the president and registered agent of Barrier Free Environments, Inc., which was founded in 1974. It was a consulting firm focused on accessibility and universal design. He was also a Principal at BFE Architecture, P.A.
In conjunction with his alma mater, North Carolina State University’s School of Design in Raleigh, he founded the Center for Accessible Housing in 1989. It later became the Center for Universal Design. This center, which received federal funding, became “a leading national and international resource for research and information on universal design in housing, products, and the built environment.” He was also a Research Professor in the Architecture Department at the School of Design.
Honors and awards.
Mace was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. In 1992, Mace received the Distinguished Service Award of the President of the United States from President Bush “for promoting dignity, equality, independence, and employment of disabled people.” In 1996, Mace received a Presidential Citation from the American Institute of Architects. He also received the 1997 North Carolina State University Distinguished Alumni Award.
Personal life.
Mace was married to Lockhart Follin-Mace, who served as the first Executive Director of the Governor’s Advocacy Council for Persons with Disabilities from its creation in 1979. Follin-Mace died in 1991 from cancer.
Mace was survived by his nephew William H. Mace, III and his partner Joy Weeber.
Death.
Ronald L. Mace died at his home in Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 29, 1998. The cause of death was a heart arrhythmia caused by polio.

Information centre hypothesis

The information centre hypothesis (ICH) is a theory that states bird species live in communal roosts primarily for the advantage of gaining information from others in the community regarding the location of unevenly distributed food resources. This hypothesis was first proposed by Peter Ward and Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi (1973). They stated that birds join assemblages in order to gain information about food resources and increase foraging efficiency. Using this strategy would allow unsuccessful birds to return to the population and gain information, often by observing behavioural differences in successful birds. Following the exchange of knowledge, the unsuccessful individuals then follow those deemed successful back to the resource location.
The hypothesis has been studied and experimentally supported in many different types of communally roosting birds, notably crows and vultures. This strategy is regarded as evolutionarily adaptive, because it would prevent the unsuccessful bird from having to start the search for food over in a random method. By the early 1980s, the information centre hypothesis was widely accepted and used to explain communal roosting behaviour, however this popularity also led to substantial criticism. One criticism of the theory is the multiple assumptions required to fulfill the criteria to support the hypothesis. Another criticism of the theory is its narrow scope, as it pertains strictly to food information sharing. Additional criticism questions whether the information centre hypothesis is an evolutionarily stable strategy.
Theory.
The information centre hypothesis was first described by Peter Ward and Amotz Zahavi in 1973. They theorized that communal roosts evolved and were maintained as a result of the advantage obtained by unsuccessful individuals in locating food resources from information provided by successful individuals. The information centre hypothesis requires that two conditions be met; first, that successful individuals return to the communal roost after feeding, and second, birds without the knowledge of the food source must recognize these individuals as successful and then follow them back to the food source. In their primary work, Ward and Zahavi studied red-billed quelea and cattle egret birds, noting that individuals who were unsuccessful in the morning would return to the communal roost and follow other birds away from the roost in the afternoon.
Mock et al. (1988) provide seven requirements which must be fulfilled in a species for the information centre hypothesis to be supported. First, birds who are successful in foraging must return to rewarding locations. Second, while some individuals discover these rewarding locations, others remain unaware of these locations. Third, previously unsuccessful individuals must be able to recognize others as successful or unsuccessful. Fourth, unsuccessful individuals must leave the communal roost when the successful individuals leave the roost. Fifth, the previously unsuccessful individuals must follow the successful individuals to the feeding location. Sixth, previously unsuccessful individuals must be permitted to share the food source by successful individuals. Seventh, the overall net benefit of receiving information and following, must be greater than an individual searching for food on their own.
While it may seem counterproductive for a successful individual to share resource knowledge, the information centre hypothesis argues that this behaviour is adaptive. The information centre hypothesis argues this behaviour is a defensive mechanism so that in the event of a sudden resource devaluation which destroys the food source, the bird would be able to obtain new resource information from other roosting individuals. This idea has been supported in studies which show that individuals in areas with a recent heavy snowfall searched longer for a communal roost compared to individuals in non-snowy areas. This is potentially so the bird would be able to upgrade their resource knowledge with others' information.
Support for the information centre hypothesis includes the idea that individuals living in groups have more resource information available, at a lower cost than finding it themselves. In addition, multiple studies have made note that food sources for flock-living birds are typically consumed quickly by other predators, such as mammals or decomposers. Therefore, individuals likely do not suffer from sharing knowledge with conspecifics due to the short-lived nature of the resource.
Currently, there is only speculation as to how the information is conveyed. It has been suggested that the successful members first convey their knowledge through displays and the unsuccessful members then follow, or that the unsuccessful members circle in the air or slowly fly out and proceed to join the successful members when they take off. Ward and Zahavi approached the explanation for the ICH in several different ways, but each explanation is related to the ability to distribute knowledge of resources. In this case, roosting can be divided into several components: advertisement, synchronized breeding, seasonality, mood, and predation.
Ward and Zahavi cited a variety of species that demonstrate behaviors supporting the ICH but no species exhibited all of the behaviors. Red-winged blackbirds ("Agelaius phoeniceus") exhibit synchronized breeding patterns, as well as have displays to attract birds to join the same nesting site. An observation Ward and Zahavi had done of red-billed queleas and the cattle egrets showed altered behavior after individually failing to find food in the morning and later in the afternoon. However, after resting in a secondary roost, these birds that failed joined other birds and flew off in a completely different direction. White wagtails and cattle egrets are two species proposed to demonstrate advertisement, with their coloring and pattern making them very noticeable and the two species often choosing open places for assemblages. There is also a large variety of finch species that have large, long-term roosting sites as well as large food searching areas.
Critiques of ICH.
On an individual basis, there are not many benefits for aiding other unsuccessful and naïve or “clueless” members. For example, it is energetically costly for a successful forager to fly back to the roost and back again to the food source with more foragers. There may even be a risk of disease or parasitism with the clueless foragers accompanying the successful forager. It may be that the successful forager expects reciprocal altruism—where the unsuccessful members could provide food knowledge to the successful forager in the future—but given the size and mobility of roosts, this is unlikely to be the case.
There are some questions about the applications of ICH before and after roost members fly out to search for food. It is possible that members that leave the roost at the same time will search for food independently afterwards. In fact, large group movement may be completely unrelated to food, and may be for protection from predators when flying to another location. Prior to flying out, it is difficult to determine how the transfer of information occurs. It may be that rather than at the roost, the transfer occurs locally at the food site. For instance, an individual may notice the large movement of members towards a specific location from afar.
The ICH may also not apply to all species, as there are variations in hunting and scavenging behaviors. For instance, some piscivorous herons rely on stealth, which is the opposite of group feeding and movement. Several heron species are also highly territorial and do not allow for conspecific feeding. Some studies of gulls also show that colony members did not follow the knowledgeable gulls. In these cases, gull foraging behavior might be better explained by local transfer of information.
Examples.
In hooded crows.
The information centre hypothesis has been studied in hooded crows ("Corvus cornix"). Hooded crows exhibit communal roosting behaviour and often feed in flocks, making them a good candidate species for studies of the information centre hypothesis. A study conducted by Sonerud, Smedshaug, and Brathen (2001) examined the roost and feeding behaviours of 34 hooded crows over three years, with results supporting the information centre hypothesis. Sonerud et al. created an environment with unpredictable and ephemeral food sources, similar to the natural environment in which the crows live. The study differentiated between 'leader' crows who were knowledgeable about the food site from Day 1, as well as 'followers', who roosted overnight with leaders, and 'naive' crows who did not roost overnight with a leader or visit the food site on Day 1. Notably, they found that compared to naive individuals, follower crows which had not visited the food patch on Day 1 were significantly more likely to visit the patch on Day 2 if they roosted overnight with a leader crow familiar with the food patch, but only if the leader crow returned on Day 2 as well. This indicated that the crows who were unfamiliar with the food patch received information from the leader crows regarding their foraging success, and then followed them to the location the following day. This is supported when compared to the naive individuals who did not roost overnight with the leader, and had significantly lower levels of finding the food source on Day 2.
In vultures.
Studies of the information centre hypothesis have been conducted using the Eurasian griffon vulture ("Gyps fulvus") as a test species, due to their communal roosts which may function primarily as information centres. In a study by Harel et al. (2017), movements and behaviour of approximately 200 Eurasian griffon vultures were recorded over a five-year period. This study categorized individual vultures as either 'uninformed', indicating they had no knowledge of a currently available food source, or 'informed', if they had either been at the food source or flown directly over it in the prior two days. Study results showed that uninformed vultures followed informed vultures to successful food sources and thereby gained access to these resources. In addition, a dyad composed of an informed and an uninformed vulture who departed the roost within two minutes of each other, spent a greater amount of airtime at a spatially closer distance than individuals who left the roost on their own, indicating a follow-the-leader relationship.
Further studies have been conducted using other vulture species, such as black vultures ("Coragyps atratus") and turkey vultures ("Cathartes aura"), with results both supporting and refuting the information centre hypothesis. For example, a study by Neil Buckley (1997), black vultures were observed to benefit from communal roosting because they located food by following knowledgeable conspecifics who had previously visited the carcass food source. In the same study, communal benefits as in the black vulture were not observed for the turkey vulture individuals.
Criticism.
After its creation in 1973, the information centre hypothesis gained popularity, and with this popularity came criticism. The information centre hypothesis has faced criticism regarding its assumptions and views that the primary purpose of communal roosting is to share information regarding the location of food sources and for unsuccessful individuals to follow successful individuals back to the location. Mock et al., argue that there are other reasons for the communal roosting of birds, such as anti-predator strategies. Multiple studies have found that there was not one primary cause of communal roost development, but that other factors were equally important in the evolution of communal roosting behaviour. A further criticism states that the information centre hypothesis is not valid because it does not represent an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).
According to Heinz Richner and Philipp Heeb (1995), the primary issue with the information centre hypothesis is the concept that a successful forager would return to the roost to help other, unsuccessful individuals. They argue that this issue cannot be solved without making assumptions regarding kin benefits, and thus the hypothesis cannot be confirmed to be true. In addition, they note that the information centre hypothesis, as it was originally proposed by Ward and Zahavi, requires the assumption that individuals fluctuate between being leaders and followers, and therefore relies on altruism between individuals. Other literature also criticizes this assumption made in the original hypothesis.
Other studies have found that the information centre hypothesis lays a correct framework for the communal roosting of some species, but should be broadened to include aspects beyond resource knowledge sharing, such as information regarding mates and predators. A review paper by Bijleveld et al. (2009) suggests that broadening the hypothesis to include these other information sharing possibilities better explains the phenomenon of communal roosting. For example, Ward and Zahavi argued that a dramatic aerial display by a bird was an advertisement to others regarding their knowledge of a food source. However, there may be broader implications that the original ICH allows for, such as the advertisement acting as an individual signal of quality to increase the advertising individuals chance of obtaining a high quality mate. This example supports the broadening of the hypothesis on the basis that more information than just food resource location is being shared.

Hongō campus

The Hongō campus is one of five campuses of the University of Tokyo. Most of the more specific and advanced undergraduate course are taken here and many research laboratories are located in the Hongō campus area. The Hongo district campus is further divided into three districts: Hongo, Yayoi, and Asano, and they are called Hongo Campus, Yayoi Campus, and Asano Campus respectively.
History.
Edo Period.
Most of this area was part of the Kaga Domain. Other clans settled in this regions were: the Toyama and Daishōji (in the University of Tokyo Hospital area) and the Mito and (in the Yayoi and Asano campus area). During the Meiji Restoration, most of this land was taken over by the new government and became official land.
University of Tokyo Integration.
In the Meiji era, in 1876, the Tokyo Medical School (the predecessor of Tokyo University School of Medicine) moved to the former site of the clan residence. Then, in 1884 the College of Science, Law, and Literature relocated here from Kanda. Then, the Judicial Ministry Law School was merged with the College of Law, followed by the College of Arts and College of Engineering, which also merged. In the 1888 these five departments were integrated into the Tokyo Imperial University school district.
Present.
In 1923, due to the destruction of school facilities in the Great Kanto Earthquake, the transfer of schools to other areas such as Yayoi was considered. Ultimately, the district remained part of the University of Tokyo.

NamiRNAs

NamiRNAs are a type of miRNAs present in the nucleus, which can activate gene
expression by binding to the enhancer, and therefore were named nuclear activating miRNAs (NamiRNAs), such as miR-24-1 and miR-26. These miRNAs loci are enriched with epigenetic markers that display enhancer activity like histone H3K27ac, P300/CBP, and DNaseI high-sensitivity loci. These NamiRNAs are able to activate the related enhancers and co-work with them to up-regulate the expression of neighboring genes. NamiRNAs are able to promote global gene transcription by binding their targeted enhancers in whole genome level.
Canonically, miRNAs silence gene expression through binding to the complementary sequences of their targeted mRNAs that are often located in the 3’UTR in the cytoplasm since the first miRNA lin-4 has been found by Ambros Victor. As so far, most studies of miRNAs have focused on those in the cytoplasm.
Other than the classical theory that miRNAs down-regulate target genes by binding to the 3’UTR of mRNA, it has also been showed that miRNAs could upregulate gene expression in certain cases, just like RNAa phenomenon, which describes a picture that miRNAs can bind to the promoter of the target genes to facilitate gene transcriptions. Moreover, Vasudevan S. et. al held that miRNAs display a pattern of up-regulation on gene transcription together with AGO2 and FXR1. The discovery of NamiRNAs showcases a complementary regulatory mechanism of miRNAs, demonstrating their different roles in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Molecular mechanism.
The classical theory of miRNAs is that genomic DNA first transcribes into pri-miRNAs. Next, pri-miRNAs were cleaved into pre-miRNAs by Drosha in the nucleus. Then, pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm via Exportin5, and are cut again by Dicer to form mature miRNAs. However, this theory cannot explain the distribution of miRNAs in the nucleus. One possible explanation is that miRNAs in cytoplasm can be carried back into the nucleus by some transport proteins. However, there is no direct evidence to support it. Another reasonable explanation is that pre-miRNAs could form mature miRNAs directly in the nucleus by Dicer cleavage. This is a simpler and more energy-efficient method. Yet, the molecular mechanism of NamiRNAs is still not fully understood.
NamiRNA is overlapped within the enhancer regions and it is also activated when it positively regulates its corresponding enhancers. Thus, the crosstalk between NamiRNA and enhancer will further promote a series of genes transcription. We can say that NamiRNA and enhancer mutually affect each other to form a positive feedback network and together play regulatory functions on gene expression.
Functions.
NamiRNAs could interact with the corresponding enhancer, enhance the enrichment of active enhancer markers like H3K27ac and H3K4me1, and change chromatin status within the enhancer regions, thus promoting the cognate gene transcription at genome-wide scale.
Perspectives on the role.
Traditional theory holds that miRNAs play inhibitory functions in the cytoplasm by binding the 3’ UTR of targeted mRNA and downregulate gene transcription. The discovery of NamiRNAs provides a brand-new idea that miRNAs can also play positive roles on gene expression in transcriptional level in the nucleus. To summarize, miRNAs have dual functions in gene regulation in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. That is, miRNAs play an inhibitory function in the cytoplasm and an activating function for the gene expression in the nucleus, respectively. Meanwhile, a functional network between NamiRNAs and enhancers is put forward to illustrate their roles for the positive regulation of their targeted gene transcription. NamiRNA enhancer target gene activation network demonstrates the new function of miRNA located in the nucleus.

Janeil Engelstad

Janeil Engelstad is an American artist and curator. Her work focuses on the role of the arts and design in addressing social and environmental concerns. In addition to working independently, Engelstad produces projects through her organization Make Art with Purpose (MAP).
Projects.
AMPL!FY.
AMPL!FY grew from the national project "Dialogues on Race", a project that Engelstad designed and produced through Make Art with Purpose. Participants including artists, graphic designers, activists, organizations and youth created billboards and posters on racial equality issues, which were then discussed in community forums. After the United States Presidential Election, 2016, Engelstad worked with graphic designer Mark Randall (2017 American Institute of Graphic Arts Gold Medalist) to change "Dialogues on Race" into a project that aimed to address political divisions in a productive way. Project partners of AMPL!FY included the Museum of Arts and Design, New York City Department of Transportation’s Art Program (NYC DOT) and Harlem Stage. Its goal is to create media content and promotion for grassroots organizations working on social and environmental issues. Operating in New York City in 2017 and 2018, AMPL!FY included posters designed by a graphic designer or artist working in partnership with a non-profit organization, installed in the Financial District in Manhattan and in Harlem, using NYC DOT's exhibition display cases. An accompanying exhibition at MAD included participatory public programs that aimed to "amplify" social and climate issues. Educational programs were also produced on site where students used the posters to discuss topics such as criminal justice reform, Islamophobia and disability rights, and discussions of the role of activist art in the political and social history of the United States.
Beyond Borders.
As a visiting artist at the Center for Creative Connections, Dallas Museum of Art (DMA), Engelstad produced "Beyond Borders", a project on the links between works of art, focusing on cultures and traditions that are little known or misunderstood. The project was launched at the time of Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780, which affected on travel to the United States, as well as Executive Order 13767 which ordered a wall to be built on Mexico–United States border. Engelstad created a set of laminated cards featuring six works of art from the DMA's permanent collection. The front of each card includes an image of the selected work of art and a phrase that Engelstad wrote or found. Her interpretation of the work of art is on the back of each card. The set of cards, in Spanish and English, also includes a map of the three floors of this tour. "Beyond Borders" also included public programs for museum visitors.
Art and the environment in Eastern and Central Europe.
Engelstad was guest producer of a special issue of the online edition of the MIT journal "ARTMargins", on historical and contemporary environmental art in the former Eastern Bloc countries and their relationship to capitalism, globalization, climate change and the legacy of socialism. Participants included Nina Czlegledy, Maja and Reuben Fowkes, Tamás Kaszás, Marjetica Potrč and Rudolf Sikora. The project included interviews and other forms of interaction with artists and cultural producers concerned with the idea and the material reality of what goes by the name of the "natural environment."
Voices From the Center.
"Voices From the Center" was an oral history project on changes in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary since the demolition of the Berlin Wall. The project stemmed from Engelstad’s experience as a Fulbright Scholar teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Wanting to understand the impact of socialism on individuals and their outlook towards the USA, in relationship to her own experience growing up in the Western side of The Cold War, Engelstad had conversations with people about their lives before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many of the participants, who ranged in age from 45–85, felt that despite the historical attention paid to life during Eastern bloc communism, the profundity of their experiences was being lost to history. Engelstad created "Voices From the Center" with the intention of including views on socialism in Central Europe from all of the Visegrad Group countries. The project also included contributions from young adults, who had been children when the wall came down, about their views of life in the post-communist era. People from both groups talked about what freedom meant to them and had the opportunity to express their dreams, fears and hopes for themselves, their country and the world. Material from "Voices From the Center" was exhibited in museums and galleries, public art, libraries, and public talks in Central Europe and the United States and on the project's website.
Peace Room / Make Room for Peace.
Engelstad sent questionnaires to people in living in North America, Europe and the Middle East on their ideas about peace following the September 11 attacks. The material that was sent to Engelstad by the survey participants, including poetry, prose, images and music was collected into a book and was followed by design of a public space with furniture and tableware within the gallery. The exhibition space was used to discuss the many different definitions of peace and the tangibility of peace within individuals and groups. Peace Room / Make Room for Peace was published in the "Chicago Tribune" newspaper, where readers were asked to contribute their own vision of peace to be designed on their own peace plate. Families, school and church groups, individuals and pairs from the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana sent in designs. A panel, consisting of Engelstad, a peace policy professional and editors from the "Tribune" selected the winning designs.
Peace Signs / Visualizing Violence.
In partnership with Mark Randall of World Studio, Engelstad created and produced a multi-platform media art project called "Peace Signs" on youth gun violence in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago. Each iteration of the project included workshops for high school and college students in design, media literacy and violence prevention. The material and events produced through "Peace Signs" included billboards, transit posters, exhibitions, public talks and a peace parade.
Identity/Identité.
Produced in collaboration with Canadian artist Deborah Bennett in Montréal and Toronto, the year-long project "Identity/Identité" was on the relationship between language, cultural identity, and nationalism between the citizens of English and French speaking Canada. Work produced through this project was exhibited in galleries and libraries, and projected from storefronts in Toronto and Montréal. Project partners included Toronto Public Library, University of Toronto, Oboro Art Centre, and Concordia University.
Make Art with Purpose.
In 2010 Engelstad founded "Make Art with Purpose" (MAP). Working in collaboration and across disciplines, MAP invites communities in the design and production of work to co-produce work on international social and environmental issues.

2018 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony

 
The opening ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games took place on the evening of Wednesday 4 April in the Carrara Stadium, Gold Coast. As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales. Jack Morton Worldwide was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was Hello Earth and directed by David Zolkwer.
The ceremony began at 20:00 AEST and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's Indigenous culture, Gold Coast's Surfers Paradise, wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland Youth Orchestra and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as Christine Anu, Delta Goodrem, Katie Noonan and Ricki-Lee Coutler performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised.
Preparations.
Three Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company Jack Morton Worldwide (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies Ric Birch, head of Spectak, David Atkins, head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. Ric Birch, who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
On 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was David Zolkwer, Head of Jack Morton Worldwide Public Events. David previously led the teams for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Australian singer Katie Noonan, winner of five ARIA music awards and former lead singer of Brisbane based band George, was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said "I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do." She has served as the Artistic Director of the Queensland Music Festival since 2015.
Nathan M. Wright served as the Head of Choreography and Staging Director for the opening ceremony. Nathan is a highly respected choreographer and performer who has worked on large-scale events extensively, including choreography for the opening and closing ceremonies of both the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London and the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The role of Executive Producer for the ceremonies was given to Merryn Hughes.

Solidarność (video game)

Solidarność is a 1991 Polish strategy computer game developed by P.Z.Karen Co. under the direction of Przemysław Rokita and published by California Dreams. It was created by Polish programmers specifically for an American audience in order to support a Hollywood film about the life of Lech Wałęsa, which was never actualised. The game never gained popularity and remains virtually unknown to this day.
Development.
In 1989, Przemysław Rokita left the Warsaw University of Technology and two years later he became a full-time employee of PZ Karen in the "export software" department. Located in a rented studio in Warsaw's Żoliborz, the PZKaren Co. Development Group was in charge of software development for the American and Western European market. In 1990, the "Solidarność" project came along, and he became the manager, main programmer, and game logic concept author.
Gameplay and plot.
Set in Poland in the 1980s, the player takes the role of the leader of an illegal union, and aims to gain more support in 8 regions than the Communists. The player achieves this through speeches, printing leaflets, organizing demonstrations and strikes. The 8 regions that Poland is divided into are: Pomerania, Northeastern (areas of Warmia, Mazury and Podlasie), Greater, Mazovia, Lower Silesia, Upper Silesia, and Malopolska.
Critical reception.
Gry Online felt the game had a "thought-out visual frame" and represented the transition in gaming production between the 1980s and 1990s. Eurogamer thought that even by 2015 the game was absorbing, and that players soon forgot about the "archaic layout". Komputer Świat said that while the title is not commonly known and remembered, it is a very important topic within Polish video gaming history.
The game is unrelated to the educational title .

Stoker began her career as a clerk and solicitor in Brisbane with Minter Ellison in 2006. She went on to serve as a Commonwealth prosecutor, as well as a judge's associate to Philip McMurdo in the Supreme Court of Queensland, and to Ian Callinan in the High Court of Australia. 
Prior to her appointment to the Senate, Stoker was a member of Level Twenty-Seven Chambers and a sessional academic at Central Queensland University. She was vice-president of the Women Lawyers Association of Queensland from 2016 to 2018.
During her legal career, Stoker had a particular interest in administrative law and statutory interpretation.
From 2014 to 2018, Stoker was a director at the non-profit, Brisbane-based conservative "think tank", the Australian Institute for Progress (AIP). During her time there, the AIP was a critic of anti-mining advocacy groups holding charitable status, and hosted a visit to Brisbane by climate science denier Patrick Moore. Also during Stoker's time, the AIP opposed tobacco plain packaging and criticised the World Health Organization's proposed international convention on tobacco.
Political career.
In 2010, Stoker was the treasurer of the Young LNP. She was concurrently a member of the Liberal National Party Policy Standing Committee and chair of the Media and Communications Policy Committee from 2009 to 2016. Stoker unsuccessfully sought LNP pre-selection for the electoral district of Cleveland at the 2009 Queensland state election, and was an unsuccessful LNP Senate candidate at the 2013 federal election. She was a member of the party's state executive from 2014 to 2017. 
On 10 March 2018, the Queensland LNP chose Stoker from a field of 12 candidates to succeed high-profile cabinet member George Brandis as a senator for Queensland. Endorsed by the LNP State Executive Council, she did not face a vote by rank-and-file members. "The Australian" reported that LNP members were threatening to push for gender quotas if the party did not preselect a woman, and the "Daily Mercury" reported that LNP sources had said Stoker was one of the standouts, because she was based in Brisbane and would also increase the LNP's percentage of females. The LNP president denied gender was a motive, saying Stoker was chosen on merit. Stoker was appointed to the casual vacancy left by Brandis on 21 March 2018 and she was sworn in as a senator the following day. Prior to Stoker's appointment to the senate, all federal LNP senators were men. As an appointed senator, she will face her first election in 2022.
On 22 December 2020, Stoker was appointed as the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General. On 30 March 2021, she was appointed to additional positions of Assistant Minister for Women and Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. In May 2021, a squabble broke out between Stoker and the LNP Queensland state council when she was relegated to the third-spot on the Senate voting ticket for the 2022 federal election.
Political positions.
In 2020, "The Australian" named Stoker a "free speech champion and rising star of conservative politics". She is part of the Liberal Party's conservative faction and is aligned with the LNP's Christian right. Stoker is a self-described "proud conservative" Christian who believes Christian values are "under attack". Her political heroes are former prime minister John Howard and former UK leader Margaret Thatcher. In 2019, "Crikey" reported that she is a social and fiscal conservative who had positioned herself as a champion of free speech and religious freedom. She claims conservatives are "misunderstood". Stoker has been a speaker at a number of centre-right conservative conferences.
"The Catholic Leader" wrote that, in her maiden speech, she had made the "brave observation" that "Australians don't trust politicians. In fact, Australians are losing faith across the four sectors of the economy – government, media, corporate and non-government organisations". Stoker has spoken out against abortion and opposes the introduction of voluntary euthanasia legislation. Stoker is a proponent for the introduction of a "religious discrimination bill".
Stoker advocates for the repeal of section 18C of the "Racial Discrimination Act". In 2018 she said: "I think 18C has got to go. I think 18C is a drag on our society." The Opposition responded by saying this would "water down protections against racist hate speech".
Stoker blames unions for the casualisation of workplaces, and argues against raising minimum wages and penalty rates because doing so would "reduce job opportunities for those most in need". She has also described unfair dismissal laws as a "block to growth".
Stoker supports the development of an Australian nuclear energy industry. She opposed the Government ban on the personal import of liquid nicotine used for vaping.
On sex &amp; gender.
Stoker has implied that women with children were "baggage" from an employer's perspective. She has pushed for nannies to be tax-deductible. In July of 2021, Stoker was quoted commending changes to the LNP constitution to take a "zero tolerance" approach to sexual misconduct as part of a new complaints and investigation process. She said that it was an "important signal to women that their safety matters to the LNP".
In 2020, Stoker faced criticism when she said former Queensland LNP leader Deb Frecklington "should not be playing the gender card" by speaking out against bullying from within the party.
She has opposed the transgender rights movement, and has said that her political opponents prioritise the rights of the LGBTIQ community over the "rights to freedom of conscience, religion and speech". Citing the importance of keeping women's sport for women and the protection of children from dangerous hormone and surgical procedures. Additionally, Stoker told "The Australian" that everyone is entitled to support and respect, however inclusion of the trans-identifying adults could not "mean we neglect our duties to children." In 2020, Stoker launched a petition against "dangerous and radical ideas" and "completely unreasonable" demands of the transgender activist agenda.
In 2018, Stoker opposed a proposed bill to remove an exemption in the "Sex Discrimination Act 1984" that would allow religious schools to expel students on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In articulating her opposition to the proposal, she expressed concern that children may want "to run a gay club within the school". She has claimed that sexuality is a "choice".
'Knee on the throat' comments.
In 2020, during a televised interview on Sky News, Stoker criticised Queensland's decision to close its borders during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk "knows she is absolutely choking our economy by having these borders shut – she is the knee on the throat of businesses of Queensland, stopping them from breathing". Indigenous Labor Senator Malarndirri McCarthy said the comments invoked a reference to the killing of George Floyd. Stoker's spokesman had initially said she would not be backing away from her comments, but in a subsequent speech to parliament, Stoker apologised to anyone genuinely hurt or offended, stating it was an 'unfortunate turn of phrase' used to emphasise her hurt for local Queensland businesses harmed by prolonged lockdowns.
'Mandy Jane'.
In 2020, Stoker admitted to using the pseudonym "Mandy Jane" to post comments in the third person on her own official Facebook site which defended and argued for the senator's views on topics including race, family law and religious freedom. Posts using Stoker's Mandy Jane profile referred to Stoker in the third person and copied the senator's own comments, while changing the pronouns to make it appear that they were from a different person. The Facebook profile photo of Mandy Jane was that of a storybook character. Stoker's spokesman said the Mandy Jane account was the senator's personal profile but denied she should have disclosed that before posting the material on her own page.
Personal life.
Stoker lives with her family in Auchenflower, a suburb of Brisbane. She married her husband, Adam, in 2005 and they have three daughters. She is a Christian and attends an Anglican church in inner-city Brisbane.

Amiri and Rahiem Taylor

Amiri and Rahiem Taylor (born 1994) are American singer-songwriters. They lead the psychedelic rock band Blac Rabbit and are identical twin brothers.
The Taylors were raised in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and learned to play instruments in imitation of the Beatles. After high school they formed Blac Rabbit, recruiting a drummer and bassist, and eventually left supermarket jobs. They became known for Beatles covers on New York City Subway stations with voices said to closely resemble John Lennon and Paul McCartney's harmonies.
Early life.
Amiri and Rahiem Taylor are identical twins, born in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York City, in the mid-1990s. They grew up around their grandfather's jazz and their grandmother's Beatles records. Despite being surrounded by hip hop music in Brooklyn, they were influenced more by the pop, funk, and soul of the 1960s and 1980s.
In high school they were introduced to playing guitar through the video game "", a Christmas gift from their grandmother. From there they started emulating the Beatles by watching recordings of them; they call the Lennon–McCartney partnership "arguably the greatest songwriting duo of all time".
Career.
They began composing original music after they learned how to play Beatles songs on actual instruments. Originally a hobby, their music evolved and "eventually turned into a band". Shortly after graduating from high school in the early 2010s, they met drummer Patrick Jones at an open mic in Brooklyn. Keeping in contact, they formed a band which became the psychedelic rock group Blac Rabbit. The band released the self-titled EP "Blac Rabbit" in December 2017.
The Taylors' first street performance was to raise enough money to visit their mother in Puerto Rico. They earned fare for round-trip plane tickets, about $400, within two days. After some time working in supermarkets and being prompted by their family to enroll in college, they began busking full-time, five or six times a week. "For us, it was music or die," Raheim said. In the New York City Subway, their regular performing locations became the Times Square, Herald Square, and Delancy Street stations. "Busking definitely sharpened our skills in terms of performing," Rahiem later said.
Cell-phone recordings of the Taylors' street performances have garnered hundred of thousands of views online. On January 26, 2018, New York Nico, the self-styled "unofficial talent scout of New York City", filmed them singing the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week" and released the video on his Instagram account. In March 2018, his recording was posted to Twitter and received 58 thousand retweets and three million views; the attention increased Blac Rabbit's Twitter follower count 33-fold. "Now in the subway they recognize us much more," they told "La Voz del Interior".
Soon after they received greater online publicity, several fans began petitioning for them to go on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show". They appeared on the program on March 22, 2018. Before playing "Eight Days a Week", they told the host about their delight in seeing reactions to their Beatles covers: "When we play, usually people are expecting Bob Marley or Stevie Wonder or something," Amiri said. Rahiem added, "It's cool to break people's expectations and to see their faces. A lot of people walk from around the corner and they just hear the music. Then, they see us and they're like, 'Whoa, really?'" After their performance, DeGeneres gifted them guitars and amplifiers; they had mentioned that they lost a guitar at a subway station. Jones and Lugo joined them on the show to play a cover of the Tame Impala song "Solitude Is Bliss".
, they reside together in Far Rockaway, Queens. They went on several tours with Blac Rabbit throughout 2018.
Musical style.
The Taylor brothers rose to prominence with their covers of Beatles song in the New York City Subway. Singing in harmony and accompanied by acoustic guitar and amplified bass, they according to several writers sound so similar to the original artists that "you could close your eyes and mistake them for Lennon and McCartney". Some listeners once asked if their vocals were prerecorded, and they responded, "[We] wish we had the tech to dub ourselves out there!"
Compared to his brother, Rahiem says that he is "the tech nerd" and "the mixing guy", being drawn to audio mixing and engineering more than Amiri, "the songwriting guy", who "has developed a great ear for chords". Artists the twins credit as influences (besides the Beatles) include Tame Impala, Radiohead, Toro y Moi, Mac DeMarco, the Police, Talk Talk, and Michael Jackson. The music of Blac Rabbit, their psychedelic rock band, incorporates elements of funk, surf music, and psychedelia. With the band, they perform both Beatles covers and original songs.

Blac Rabbit

Blac Rabbit is an American psychedelic rock band based in Rockaway Beach, Queens, New York City. It is led by twin brothers, songwriters, singers, and guitarists Amiri and Rahiem Taylor, and backed by Patrick Starr (drums), Josh Lugo (bass), and Justin Jagbir (keyboards). The band has released one self-titled EP.
History.
Around 2013, identical twin brothers Amiri and Rahiem Taylor met Patrick "Sticks" Jones at an open mic at a Sam Ash Music store in Brooklyn, New York City. All recent high-school graduates, the trio formed Blac Rabbit—they say the name Black Rabbit was already taken. The Taylors are known for covering the Beatles on the New York City Subway, and they left supermarket jobs and put off college to pursue music full-time. Bassist and occasional guitarist Josh Lugo joined later. The band is based in Rockaway Beach, Queens, New York City. It is represented by Jules Urbanski of the APA .
Blac Rabbit digitally released the song "All Good" as a single in June 2016. The song was later included on their six-track debut extended play (EP), self-titled "Blac Rabbit", which How Far Music released digitally on December 22, 2017. A CD later became available on Bandcamp. The EP was recorded in the Taylors' and their manager's houses and mixed by Rahiem. As critic Olivia D'Orazio writes, "Hazy guitar riffs and rumbling bass are steadfast throughout the EP, and the echoey vocals whisk you from one song to another."
A recording of the Taylors playing the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week" received 3 million views on Twitter and 14 million on Facebook in February 2018. The viral online recognition increased the number of the band's Twitter followers from around 500 to 16,700 in two days. The band had to update its website due to traffic spurred by the 48-second video.
With more exposure, the band could perform outside the subway with bookings in music venues, eventually playing festivals in Berlin and Guatemala as well as New York City's Bowery Ballroom and the Knitting Factory. They also covered the Beatles' "Michelle" for a Gucci advertisement featuring Harry Styles. From June 15 to July 3, 2018, the band went on a 16-date tour of the East Coast. On early tour dates far from New York City, Rahiem later recalled, some audiences who had only seen the Taylors' "Ellen" appearance thought they were a cover band and asked for Beatles tunes, which they did sometimes use to end sets. Amiri said their toughest crowd was in Montreal, where the audience had put on a "game face".
On September 13, Blac Rabbit was the musical act at an event to promote the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus in New York City recreating the 1969 Bed-In For Peace. The band performed "Give Peace a Chance" alongside speakers including Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, actor Jeff Bridges, and New York mayor Bill de Blasio; "it was so surreal in person," Amiri said. The Seize the Day Tour, Blac Rabbit's second concert tour of 2018, ran October 23 to November 10. It was followed by a tour of Europe and the United Kingdom, ending on December 3 at the Beatles Story and The Cavern Club in Liverpool. Summarizing their ascent from busking in the subway and "playing for audience of barely anyone" to booking larger venues and festivals, Amiri said: "I was scared ... All of that happened in one rush and it was just overnight."
The Taylors have announced a new Blac Rabbit record, titled "Interstella". Its first single, "Seize the Day", was released on November 21, 2018, followed by "Windy Cities" on May 10, 2019. Justin Jagbir, a keyboardist, joined the band before the release of "Intersella", and played during the "Interstella" Tour of North America, from April 2 to May 18.
On the day of the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020, Blac Rabbit played Beatles covers at Charles Finch and Chanel's pre-Oscar party at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills.
Musical style.
The Taylors describe their original music as psychedelic rock, influenced by the Beatles, Radiohead, 1980s music, and contemporaries MGMT, Tame Impala, and Toro y Moi. Rahiem has said: "We just want to make wholesome, melodic, digestible but also very intelligent, deep, thought-provoking music," and he has noted the difficulty in balancing their love of the Beatles with forming Blac Rabbit's own identity. The band performs both Beatles covers and original songs with a "vintage" sound.
Afropunk contributor Erin White wrote, "Their music has all of the positivity and optimism of an LSD trip with none of the existential dread." According to José Heinz of "La Voz del Interior", the band is "as indebted to the sounds of the '60s as to this era's New York scene". The band's EP fuses surf and psychedelic music, with some tracks tinged by funk. The Taylors' vocals, doused with reverb, have drawn comparison to those of Tame Impala.

Mo Pop Festival

The Mo Pop Festival is a music festival in Detroit. The festival features both emerging as well as established musicians, and its ambiance has been described as "boutique and niche". It showcases indie-rock, pop, and hip-hop music along with local Detroit cuisine and beverages, in addition to endeavoring to bring visitors to the city's riverfront. Though smaller in size, Mo Pop has been compared to other musical festivals such as Bonnaroo, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Pitchfork. It has also drawn comparisons to other festivals held in the city, namely the Detroit Jazz Festival and Movement Electronic Music Festival.
No event will be held in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic is to blame; the 8th is deferred to 2021.
History.
Freedom Hill Amphitheatre in Sterling Heights (2013–2014).
The inaugural 2013 Mo Pop Festival was held on a single day at the Freedom Hill Amphitheatre in suburban Sterling Heights. It featured performances by Andrew Bird, Capital Cities, Jamaican Queens, JR JR, Manchester Orchestra, The Mowgli's, Old Crow Medicine Show, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Walk off the Earth, and Wild Belle. The 2014 festival, also held at Freedom Hill, staggered set times to allow attendees to watch all musical acts, and it featured performances by City and Colour, Cold War Kids, Flint Eastwood, J Roddy Walston and the Business, Lord Huron, Tokyo Police Club, and Young the Giant. Both the 2013 and 2014 festivals were attended by approximately 7,500 people. After the 2014 festival, Mo Pop looked to move to Detroit due to both its location and to enable further growth, according to festival co-producer Jason Rogalewski.
West Riverfront Park in Detroit (2015–19, 2021–).
2015.
The 2015 Mo Pop Festival was the first to be held at West Riverfront Park in Detroit, just west of Downtown, and also the first two-day festival. Held on July 25–26, it was headlined by Modest Mouse and Passion Pit, and also featured performances by Atlas Genius, James Bay, Chromeo, Brandon Flowers, Jessica Hernandez &amp; the Deltas, Iron &amp; Wine, King Tuff, and Viet Cong. West Riverfront Park is a park on the Detroit River with views of the downtown skyline and the Ambassador Bridge, and it was created in 2014 by Detroit's Riverfront Conservancy on the site of a former "Detroit Free Press" printing facility. Described as "free-spirited" and "whimsically themed", Mo Pop's 2015 iteration once again featured two stages aligned so that attendees could watch both without physically moving, and alternated time slots between so they would not have to choose between acts performing simultaneously. In addition to music, the 2015 festival also included artisans and craft makers, visual artists, craft beer, food trucks, and even a Mo Tech village "showcasing work from local start-ups and inventors". During the festival, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the park's drainage capabilities and formed a standing body of water nicknamed "Lake Mo Pop". Mo Pop's 2015 total two-day attendance was estimated to be over 15,000.
2016.
The 2016 Mo Pop Festival, held on July 24–25 at West Riverfront Park for the second year, was headlined by Børns, G-Eazy, Haim, The Head and the Heart, and M83. It also featured performances by Coast Modern, Mac DeMarco, Glass Animals, Matt and Kim, Father John Misty, and Panama Wedding. It drew an attendance of over 20,000 people over its two days. New for 2016 was a tented arcade and games area, and a "craft village" vendor area.
2017.
The 2017 Mo Pop Festival, held on July 29–30 at West Riverfront Park, was headlined by Alt-J, Foster the People, Run the Jewels, and Solange. Other acts included Vance Joy, Middle Kids, Grace Mitchell, Phantogram, PUP, PVRIS, Tyler, the Creator, and Wavves. Both days of the festival started with back-to-back Michigan artists, including Stef Chura and Heaters. In total, the 2017 iteration of Mo Pop featured over nine hours of music with musicians on two different stages. It also included a dozen local food trucks and the Shipyard, a food and beverage court that was presented by Corktown's cocktail bar Sugar House and featured barbecue from Slows Bar BQ, hot dogs and tacos from Ferndale's Imperial restaurant, craft beers from Birmingham's Griffin Claw Brewing Company, and adult ciders from Blake's Hard Cider Company of Armada.
2018.
The 2018 Mo Pop Festival, which was held on July 28–29, was headlined by Bon Iver, The National, Portugal. The Man, and St. Vincent. It was the fourth straight festival at West Riverfront Park. Also performing were Billie Eilish, Brockhampton, Highly Suspect, Vince Staples, and the Detroit-based band Joe Hertler &amp; The Rainbow Seekers.

H'Hen Niê

H'Hen Niê ( ; born 15 May 1992) is a Vietnamese model and beauty pageant titleholder of the Rade ethnic minority group, who was crowned Miss Universe Vietnam after winning Miss Universe Vietnam 2018. She represented Vietnam at Miss Universe 2018 and finished in Top 5. She was the first Miss Universe participant from Vietnam to be from an ethnic minority group.
Early life.
H'Hen Niê was born in Đắk Lắk to parents, Y'Krin Êban, and H'Ngơn Niê. She is of Rade background, and speaks the Rade language - a Chamic language as her mother's tongue. Niê did not learn Vietnamese until eighth grade. H'Hen is the third oldest out of six children, and during her youth, she worked on a coffee farm to assist her family. Rade people's matrilineal customs meant that traditionally Rade women tend to start a family at a young age. However, H'Hen decided to break this tradition and decided to continue her studies throughout high school.
After graduating from high school, H'Hen studied a year at Nha Trang National Ethnic Community College before moving to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) to study corporate finance at the College of Foreign Economic Relations. She worked as a domestic helper for a year to pay the bills while she was in college. When H'Hen was working as an intern at a bank, she began considering a career in modelling. In 2014, shortly after graduating from college, she was discovered by Đỗ Mạnh Cường while attempting to begin a modelling career. As she gained interest and fame in the industry, she auditioned for season 6 of "Vietnam's Next Top Model" in 2015, where she became a finalist and was placed ninth in the competition.
Career.
Pageantry.
Miss Universe Vietnam 2018.
H'Hen entered Miss Universe Vietnam in 2018. During her time at Miss Universe Vietnam, she was recognized for her short hair, adventurous and outgoing personality, and tanned complexion, a contrast to the traditional Vietnamese beauty standard. In the finale, H'Hen Niê went on to win the competition, beating out first runner-up Hoàng Thùy and second runner-up Mâu Thị Thanh Thủy. Miss Universe 2008 Dayana Mendoza was a judge at the finale. When asked by a co-judge whom she would pick as the winner, Mendoza chose "the girl with short hair". As a Rade person, H'Hen Niê is currently the first and only Miss Universe Vietnam titleholder to be from an ethnic minority group, other than Kinh.
Miss Universe 2018.
She represented Vietnam at Miss Universe 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand. In the months leading up to the pageant, H'Hen's training and preparation was documented and aired as a YouTube series called "Road to Miss Universe 2018".
The Miss Universe Vietnam Organization held a contest to find the Vietnamese national costume that H'Hen would wear for the national costume competition at the pageant. Six designs made it to the final round. After a nationwide vote, the top three designs were selected: "Bánh Mì" (inspired by the Vietnamese sandwich bánh mì), "Phố cổ" (inspired by the ancient town of Hội An), and "Ngũ hổ" (inspired by the classical Hàng Trống painting and Vietnamese opera). In the end, "Bánh Mì" was selected to be Vietnam's national costume at Miss Universe 2018.
In the finale held at Impact Arena on December 17 in Bangkok, H'Hen finished as a top 5 finalist, the furthest any Vietnamese representative have made and only the second time since 2008 that Vietnam advanced through the first cut. In her top 5 interview, H'Hen received a question about whether the #MeToo movement has gone too far, for which she answered:
Alternative translation:
Post Miss Universe.
She was selected as the winner of the 2018 Timeless Beauty Award by Missosology, the popular beauty pageant blog and magazine. She defeated 112 other women competing in different major beauty pageants in 2018. Timeless Beauty has been organized annually since 2010 as a tradition of Missosology to recognize a queen who best embodies beauty that will transcend time, “something that shall be remembered for all eternity."
While having moderate success prior to the pageant competition, H'Hen's modeling career significantly took off after she won Miss Universe Vietnam 2017. She became an ambassador for various brands and appeared on multiple magazine covers and editorial features. She has walked for multiple fashion shows in Vietnam and overseas.
In July 2019, she joined Lệ Hằng, Vietnam's representative at Miss Universe 2016, to compete in season 6 of "The Amazing Race Vietnam" as the Yellow Team. The team eventually won the race and received a cash prize of 300 million VND (approximately 13,000 USD). They committed to using the prize for charity work. She was the host of "I Am Miss Universe Vietnam 2019", which premiered in October 2019. However, H'Hen had to halt her appearance in Miss Universe Vietnam 2019 due to health issues. She has denied rumors of conflict with the MUV organization or pregnancy, and continued to post about the competition on her personal social media.
Philanthropy.
H'Hen believes in the efforts of education being key for rising out of poverty. She initially committed to donate 70% of her prizes if she won the title of Miss Universe Vietnam. However, after her win, she listened to her mother's advice and gave away all of her prize money worth $10,000 to providing scholarships to students in her old schools, and hoped her story could inspire youth to overcome their struggles and continue to pursue education in life. Under her Miss Universe Vietnam reign, H'Hen rallied for support for the unfortunate, the elderly as well as HIV/AIDS victims. She became a global ambassador for Room to Read in 2018, a non-profit organization focusing on providing resources for girls' education and literacy programs. As an ambassador, she has raised approximately $20,000 for a project to build a new library in Lam Dong and provide scholarships to girls in Asia and Africa so that they could complete secondary education school and develop key life skills. The library was inaugurated in October 2018, housing over 3500 titles for students at Bao Thuan Elementary School and the local community to use. She received "Star for the Community" award at Star of the Year 2018 gala for her charity work in Vietnam.
In February 2019, she spoke to 12,000 students at a conference organized by the Francis Padua Papica Foundation in Naga, Camarines Sur, Philippines where she shared her stories and affirmed her stance on believing in oneself to overcome one's challenges. A month later, H'Hen initiated a project that would provide sanitary water and common street lights to people in her village and hoped to complete the project before she ended her reign as Miss Universe Vietnam in late 2019.

Audacity of Huge

"Audacity of Huge" is a 2009 song by Simian Mobile Disco, from their album "Temporary Pleasure". It features vocals by Chris Keating of Yeasayer. The music video was directed by Kate Moross.
"The Guardian" has described the song as the "lament (of) an uber-materialist". Its title is an allusion to Barack Obama's "The Audacity of Hope".
Reception.
At "Pitchfork", Marc Hogan called it "a limber, name-dropping, ear-catching body-mover, sleek and uncluttered and populist". "Consequence of Sound" stated that the lyrics were "hopelessly catchy non sequiturs", while "NME" felt that they were the only thing that made the song "listenable" (instead of "as annoying as stubbing your toe"). "The Quietus" praised it as "amusingly bizarre" and "a pitch-perfect satire of the bling-bejewelled breast-beating so prevalent on "808s and Heartbreaks"".

<doc id="56887804" url="?curid=56887804" title="Isekai">
Isekai

 is a Japanese genre of light novels, manga, anime and video games that revolve around a person who is transported to and has to survive in another world, such as a fantasy world, virtual world, planet or parallel universe. This plot device allows the audience to learn about the new world at the same pace as the protagonist.
The concept of "Isekai" started in folk tales, such as Urashima Tarō. However, the first modern "Isekai" works were Haruka Takachiho's novel "Warrior from Another World" and Yoshiyuki Tomino's television series "Aura Battler Dunbine".
Characteristics.
The genre can be divided into two types and . In "transition into another world" stories, the protagonist gets transported to another world (e.g. by traveling into it, or being summoned into it).
In many examples, the main character is an ordinary person who thrives in their new environment thanks to things normal in the real world being seen as extraordinary in the "other" world. This can be physical characteristics, such as hair or eye color, or normal, every day skills they learned in their previous life such as cooking, engineering, basic education, or medicine, which are far more advanced in the modern, real world than in the world they are sent to. In "Sorcerous Stabber Orphen", an entire population of humans appeared in the magically created world was transported from Earth and got partially mixed with local dragonlike Heavenly Beings.
While the protagonist of a classic "isekai" work is usually a "chosen hero", there have been a large number of alternative takes on the concept. One trend is the protagonist inhabiting the body of an unimportant side character, or even a villain (as in '). In these stories, the goal of a protagonist is typically to reform the character in order to avoid a bad fate or death, often being so successful that they become the new lead. There are even instances of protagonists becoming inhuman creatures, such as in "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime", where the protagonist starts as a slime with special abilities rather than a human, or even inanimate objects, like a magical onsen. Others, known as "reverse "isekai", follow beings from a fantasy universe who have been transported to or reincarnated on modern-day Earth, including the anime "Laidbackers" and '.
An offshoot of the isekai genre is the "second chance" or "reincarnation" genre, where a protagonist who, upon dying, finds themselves transported, not to a different world and new body, but into their own younger self. With their new knowledge and older intellect, they are able to relive their life avoiding their previous pitfalls. Another offshoot of the genre include the "slow life" approach, where the protagonist was overworked in their previous life, so decides to take it easy in the next. Another offshoot is where the protagonist uses the new world to explore an interest, hobby, or goal they had in the previous world but where unable to achieve, such as studying or perhaps opening a business, like in "Restaurant to Another World".
In many works, isekai overlaps with the harem genre, where the protagonist gains the affections of several potential love interests, who may or may not be human. One example of this is "Isekai Meikyū de Harem o".
History.
The concept of has origins in ancient Japanese literature, particularly the story of a fisherman Urashima Tarō, who saves a turtle and is brought to a wondrous undersea kingdom. After spending what he believed to be four to five days there, Urashima returns to his home village only to find himself 300 years in the future. The folk tale was adapted into one of the earliest anime films, Seitaro Kitayama's "Urashima Tarō", in 1918. Other precursors to isekai include portal fantasy stories from English literature, notably the novels "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (1865), "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (1900), "Peter Pan" (1904) and "The Chronicles of Narnia" (1950). 
Modern Japanese media.
The earliest modern Japanese "isekai" stories include Haruka Takachiho's novel "Warrior from Another World" (1976) and Yoshiyuki Tomino's anime "Aura Battler Dunbine" (1983). Other early anime and manga titles that could be classified as "isekai" include "Mashin Hero Wataru" (1988 debut), "NG Knight Ramune &amp; 40" (1990 debut), "Fushigi Yûgi" (1992 debut) and "El-Hazard" (1995 debut), in which the protagonists stayed similar to their original appearance upon entering a different world. Other 1990s titles identified as "isekai" include the novel and anime series "The Twelve Kingdoms" (1992 debut), the manga/anime/game franchise "Magic Knight Rayearth" (1993 debut), the visual novel adventure game "" (1996), the manga and anime series "InuYasha" (1996 debut), and the anime series "Now and Then, Here and There" and "Digimon Adventure" (both 1999 debut). The anime film "Spirited Away" (2001) was one of the first worldwide known isekai anime films, although the term "isekai" was not commonly used at the time.
The role-playing adventure game "" (1997), and the "Digimon Adventure" (1999 debut) and ".hack" (2002 debut) franchises, were some of the first works to present the concept of isekai as a virtual world, with "Sword Art Online" (2002 web novel debut) following in their footsteps. Another isekai anime series from the 2000s is "Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi" (2002).
A popular isekai light novel and anime series in the 2000s was "The Familiar of Zero" (2004 debut), where the male lead Saito is from modern Japan and is summoned to a fantasy world by the female lead Louise. "The Familiar of Zero" popularized the isekai genre in web novel and light novel media, along with the website Shōsetsuka ni Narō ("Let's Become Novelists"), known as Narō for short. "The Familiar of Zero" fan fiction became popular on Narō during the late 2000s, eventually spawning a genre of isekai novels on the site, which became known as Narō novels. "The Familiar of Zero" fan fiction writers eventually began writing original isekai novels, such as Tappei Nagatsuki who went on to create "" (2012 debut). The 2012 anime adaptation of "Sword Art Online (SAO)" popularized the isekai genre in anime, which led to more isekai web novels being published on Narō and a number of Narō novels being adapted into anime. It was around this time that the term "isekai" was coined.
Later titles such as "Knight's &amp; Magic" (2010 debut) and "The Saga of Tanya the Evil" (2013 debut) involved their protagonists dying and being reincarnated in a different world. The most influential "isekai" novel in that regard was "Mushoku Tensei" (2012 debut), which began as a Narō novel and popularized the reincarnation sub-genre of isekai while establishing a number of common isekai tropes. "Mushoku Tensei" was the most popular Narō novel for a number of years, and thus served as a point of reference for numerous isekai writers that followed.
The "isekai" genre became so popular during the early- and mid-2010s that it started to generate backlash, both in Japan and overseas, from those who felt that it was overcrowding the greater manga &amp; anime market. In 2016, a Japanese short story contest organized by Bungaku Free Market and Shōsetsuka ni Narō placed a blanket ban on any entries involving "isekai". The publisher Kadokawa banned "isekai" stories as well in their own anime/manga-style novel contest in 2017. In May 2021, Kadokawa announced they would open an "Isekai Museum" in July of the same year.

Sister Jean

Sister Jean, BVM (born Jean Dolores Schmidt, August 21, 1919), is an American religious sister of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and chaplain for the Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team of Loyola University Chicago.
Early life.
Jean Dolores Schmidt was born on August 21, 1919 in San Francisco, California, and raised in the Eureka Valley neighborhood. She first considered becoming a nun while she was in third grade. As a student at St. Paul's High School, she played on the girls basketball team. After graduating from high school in 1937, she entered the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary convent in Iowa. In 1941, by then a sister, she returned to teach in California. Sister Jean completed her B.A. at Mount St. Mary's College (now Mount St. Mary's University in Los Angeles) in 1949 and M.A. at Loyola University of Los Angeles (now Loyola Marymount University) in 1961.
Career.
Sister Jean moved from California to teach at Mundelein College in Chicago in 1961. During the mid-1960s, she was active in the civil rights movement.
She was hired by Loyola in 1991 when Mundelein was merged into Loyola. She has worked as the team chaplain for the Ramblers men's basketball team since 1994. In 2016, she was presented with an honorary doctorate from Loyola. Providing a mix of spiritual and scouting support, Schmidt inspired her own bobblehead doll in 2011 and was honored with a "Sister Jean Day" on December 1, 2012.
Sister Jean gained overnight publicity beyond the Loyola community after the Ramblers' upset of Miami in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. Her fame continued to grow after the team upset Tennessee in the round of 32, sending Loyola to their first Sweet 16 appearance in 33 years. The then-98-year-old nun quickly became a star in the tournament; her bobblehead sold for more than $300 on eBay. Loyola ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1963, but they were defeated by Michigan in the semifinal game. Sister Jean maintains an office in the student center on campus and lives in a freshman dorm, offering advice to those who visit her.
Sister Jean again drew national attention when Loyola appeared in the 2021 tournament. After reaching the round of 32 as an 8 seed, she incorporated a scouting report into her opening prayer for the game against the top-seeded Illinois Fighting Illini, a team she was reluctant to play against because she did not want to root against another team from the same home state. The Ramblers went on to upset the Illini, 71–58. She had initially been barred from appearing at the tournament but was later cleared after she received a COVID-19 vaccine.

The Study Quran

The Study Quran: A New Translation and Commentary is a 2015 English-language edition of the Quran edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr and published by HarperOne. Caner Dagli, Maria Massi Dakake, and Joseph Lumbard prepared the translation, wrote the commentary, and also served as general editors, and Mohammed Rustom contributed as an assistant editor. Alongside a new English translation and extensive commentary, "The Study Quran" features numerous essays, maps, and other material.
Development.
The idea of an English-language Quran for scholars and students was originally proposed to Nasr by HarperOne (then HarperSanFrancisco), who wanted Nasr as the editor-in-chief. Nasr initially declined, but after the publisher told him that the book would not happen without him, he felt obligated to lead the project. Nasr had several conditions for the work: firstly, that it would avoid modernistic and fundamentalist interpretations of the Quran, instead favouring a range of traditional interpretations. He also insisted that all the editors would be Muslim. Nasr chose Dagli, Dakake, and Lumbard, all Americans and former students of his, as General Editors. Sections of the translation and commentary were apportioned to the three editors, who worked under the oversight of Nasr and in consultation with each other to preserve the unity of the project. Nasr recruited Rustom as an assistant editor after the translation and essays had been completed. "The Study Quran" took ten years to complete.
Content.
On "The Study Quran"’s English translation, Nasr writes:
"The Study Quran"’s commentary has references to 41 older commentaries that represent a variety of Islamic perspectives, including Sunni and Shiite sources, and linguistic, philosophical, mystical, and historical commentaries. It is the first edition of the Quran to combine commentaries with disparate and often conflicting interpretations in this way. The source commentaries are traditional rather than contemporary, and are dominated by Medieval works; the most recent commentators are Ibn Ashur and Tabataba'i, who both died in the 20th century.
The book also includes 15 essays written on related topics, including "How to Read the Quran", "The Quran as Source of Islamic Law", and "Conquest and Conversion, War and Peace in the Quran". The essay topics were selected by Nasr and written by a variety of contributors.
Reception.
"The Study Quran" was reviewed in scholarly journals.
Faraz Rabbani called "The Study Quran" a “deep, rich, valuable study companion for any English-speaker seeking to deepen their understanding and appreciation for the Book of Allah”, but warned readers not to “take it as “the final word” or an authoritative reference on matters of theology or law”.
Appraisal by mainstream American publications focused on "The Study Quran"'s capacity to counter extreme or fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. A report by CNN entitled “Could this Quran curb extremism?” placed the work in the context of the recent Paris attacks, emphasising that the book refutes the extremist interpretations of the Quran by ISIS and other groups. Similarly, an article in The Daily Beast presented "The Study Quran" as a “challenge” to the ultra-conservative Salafi scholars who “have monopolized English-language Muslim resources”.

Aritz Maestu

Aritz Maestu Babarro (born 19 September 1990) is a Spanish former competitive pair skater. With his former skating partner, Laura Barquero, he is the 2018 Toruń Cup champion and 2018 International Challenge Cup champion, and competed for Spain at two World Championships.
Early career.
Single skating.
Maestu began learning to skate in 2002. As a single skater, he was coached by Jonathan Levers in San Sebastián. He received one ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignment, in September 2008.
Partnership with Rodríguez.
Maestu's first pair skating partner was Alexandra Rodríguez Long. They competed two seasons together, beginning in 2010–2011. At JGP Austria in September 2011, they became the first pair to represent Spain in an international competition.
Rodríguez/Maestu skated at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Minsk, Belarus, but were eliminated after placing 12th in the preliminary round. Miguel Alegre and Emma Baxter coached the pair in Jaca, Spain.
Partnership with Grigorieva.
In September 2012, Maestu teamed up with Russia's Veronica Grigorieva to represent Spain on the senior level. The pair trained in Toruń (Poland) and Jaca (Spain), coached by Marius Siudek. Their international debut came in September 2013, at the Lombardia Trophy. A week later, they competed at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy, the final qualifying opportunity for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Their placement, 18th, was insufficient to qualify a spot at the Olympics.
Grigorieva/Maestu's final competition together was the 2014 European Championships, which took place in January in Budapest, Hungary. Ranked 20th in the short program, the pair did not advance to the free skate.
Partnership with Lech.
In 2014, Maestu teamed up with Poland's Marcelina Lech to compete for Spain. They made their international debut in February 2015, at the Bavarian Open.
Lech/Maestu placed 13th in the short program, 15th in the free skate, and 15th overall at the 2016 European Championships in Bratislava, Slovakia. They were coached by Dorota Siudek and Mariusz Siudek in Toruń, Poland.
Partnership with Barquero.
2016–2017 season.
Maestu and Laura Barquero announced their partnership on 4 January 2017. They decided to train in Bergamo, Italy, coached by Barbara Luoni and Franca Bianconi. During their first season together, the pair was ineligible for international competitions due to the ISU's age requirements – Barquero was too young for senior events and Maestu too old for juniors.
2017–2018 season.
Making their international debut, Barquero/Maestu placed 7th at the 2017 CS Lombardia Trophy in mid-September. At the end of the month, they placed 13th at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, the final qualifying opportunity for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Although their placement was not sufficient to qualify, Spain became the third alternate for a spot in the Olympic pairs' event.
In January, Barquero/Maestu placed eleventh at the 2018 European Championships in Moscow, Russia. The following month, they won gold at the Toruń Cup in Toruń, Poland, and at the International Challenge Cup in The Hague, Netherlands. They concluded the season at the 2018 World Championships, in twentieth place.
2018–2019 season.
Barquero/Maestu began the season with two Challenger assignments, finishing fifth at the 2018 CS Lombardia Trophy and eighth at the 2018 CS Finlandia Trophy. Making their Grand Prix debut with two assignments, they were seventh at the 2018 Grand Prix of Helsinki and sixth at 2018 NHK Trophy. At the 2019 European Championships they were seventh, after taking their second consecutive national title. Their final event together was the 2019 World Championships, where they placed fifteenth.
On May 31, 2019, it was announced that Maestu had suffered an injury that would involve a prolonged recovery, and in consequence of this the team had split.

Diuris exitela

Diuris exitela, commonly called the Mount Moffat doubletail, is a species of orchid which is endemic to central western Queensland. It has two linear leaves at its base, up to twelve bright yellow flowers with dark brown markings and grows on sandstone cliffs and ridges.
Description.
"Diuris exitela" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between seven and twelve bright yellow flowers with dark brown markings, wide and leaning downwards are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide and forms a hood over the rest of the flower. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, green and purple-brown, long, wide, turned downwards and usually crossed over each other. The petals are held horizontally or droop with an elliptic blade long and wide on a green to purplish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear, purplish-brown, about long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris exitela" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Mount Moffat and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("exitela") is derived from the Ancient Greek word "exitelos" meaning "lessening", "fading" or "weakening", referring to the colour of the flowers which fades quickly from bright yellow to pale yellow as they age.
Distribution and habitat.
The Mount Moffat doubletail grows mainly on sandstone cliffs and ridges but also between sandstone boulders in woodland and is found on Mount Moffat and in Carnarvon Gorge in central western Queensland.

Virtual Murder (video game series)

Virtual Murder is a four-part murder mystery adventure video game series developed by Creative Multimedia Corporation. The games were released in 1993 and 1994 for Macintosh and Windows PCs.
Development.
In 1993, Creative Multimedia Corporation decided to launch a series of police adventure video games onto the market. They sought a collaboration with Shannon Gilligan, who had a successful career as a screenwriter, novel writer, and children's book author. The series aimed to transform the passive experience of reading a murder mystery into an active multimedia gaming experience. They wanted the player experience to be grounded in realism and to be removed from the magic and science fiction of other detective mysteries. Creative Multimedia announced the games in November 1992.
On May 30, 1995, Creative Multimedia Corporation signed a deal with GTE Main Street to allow users of their interactive television network to access Creative Multimedia's CD-ROMs through their home television sets. The Virtual Murder series was among the first to be included because the game could be played using a TV remote control.
Gameplay and plot.
"Virtual Murder" is a series of CD-ROM murder mystery adventure games. The player must solve a murder, facing the media at a press conference at the end of the game's time limit. The player determines what items from the crime scene need to be fingerprinted or sent to the lab for examination. They interview the leading candidates for the crime, relying on interviews an assistant has recorded with potential witnesses and suspects.
All four games use a standard interface. The player has six hours available to visit the crime scene, perform an autopsy, examine the evidence, and interrogate the suspects. After this, players go to the press conference where they need to get up to 10 questions right to advance to the warrant stage. Here, they can further interrogate three of the suspects, then create a warrant of arrest against one of the suspects. In "Who Killed Brett Penance?", there are three different murderers, and the murderer is different in each playthrough.
Gilligan (initially portrayed by Shannon Gilligan herself and later by Sheryl Lee) serves as a detective sidekick who summarizes the crime scene, provides thumbnail sketches on suspects, and offers an opinion when queried. A throw-back to earlier narrative forms, the character was one of the few examples in interactive media around 2004 of a device called "The Fifth Business", a character who solely exists to move the characters and plot toward the conclusion. There is an occasional voiceover from the police superior who reminds the player of the work yet to be completed and the time remaining on the clock. The games contain an in-game notebook that keeps track of what the player has learned and done, a similar device to that used in the Her Interactive Nancy Drew games.
Critical reception.
Allgame reviewer Anthony Baize recommended that players take copious notes and only expect to succeed on their fifth or sixth try because of the relentless press conference and warrant application sections. Adventure Classic Gaming felt the technical merits and their boring and repetitive gameplay outweighed good intentions of the games. PixelPacas rated the first game 3 out of 5 and described is as a 1990s version of "Her Story". CD-ROM World (quoted in CDaccess.com) wrote that the games succeeded in illustrating the tools and complexities of murder investigation. Four Fat Chicks hoped their review steered away naive gamers from this game, which they considered dull and sub-par. Adventure's Planet deemed the series "absolutely mediocre". "PC Gamer" compared the gameplay to that of "", though criticized its small video window and grainy footage. 
In "The End of Books – or Books Without End?", J. Yellowlees Douglas noted that the suspects simply answer the questions to a generic detective, rather than injecting their responses with reactions to an investigator with a colorful personality such as Philip Marlowe or Virginia West. "Wired]" wrote that the series "proves the rich potential of the mystery genre in the interactive medium", and that "sophisticated multimedia entertainment can be put together on a reasonable budget". "Reconceptualizing the Literacies in Adolescents' Lives" noted that the series inspired players to create murder mysteries of their own. "Computer Gaming World" stated that because of their limited interactivity, the "Virtual Murder" series "is better understood as a work of fiction" than games, and would appeal more to mystery fans than gamers. The magazine described the acting as "surprisingly good", and hoped that "future titles will involve more interactivity ... a promising start" for CMC. "CD-ROM Today" felt the games have an intuitive interface a graceful design and thought they offered a refreshingly new standard for multimedia games. 
"Who Killed Sam Rupert?" was reviewed in 1993 in "Dragon" #195 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.
"MacUser" gave "Who Killed Brett Penance?" and "Who Killed Taylor French?" scores of 3.5 out of 5, and named them collectively one of 1995's top 50 CD-ROMs.
The series sold 900,000 copies in five languages.

QALO

 
QALO is an American jewelry company headquartered in Santa Ana, California. It primarily produces wedding and commitment rings made from silicone rather than traditional metal. QALO is an acronym for "Quality Athletics Love Outdoors."
History and products.
QALO was founded by Ted Baker and KC Holiday in 2013 at Baker's living room table in Santa Ana, California. The two had both recently married their wives and were struggling with wearing a traditional ring. They came up with the idea for silicone rings after Holiday suffered minor finger injuries while playing golf and weightlifting with traditional metallic wedding bands, resulting in him wearing no ring at all. QALO silicone rings are designed to be more comfortable and safer than traditional metal rings as they snap off if they get caught on something.
The rings are marketed towards active individuals and those with professions that result in their metal band being a safety hazard like athletes, firefighters, police officers, mechanics, electricians and others. The company also produces baseball caps and shirts.

Elsa Miranda

Elsa M. Miranda (14 February 1922 – 27 April 2007) was a noted Puerto Rican singer who was featured on radio and television in the United States during the Golden Age of Radio in the 1940s. As a naturalized Argentinean she was also active as a film actress in South America during the 1950s.
Early years.
Elsa Miranda was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, a city located in the southern region of the island. She moved to New York City with her mother Amelia Miranda (1898-2007) and became a performer who first attained notoriety as a vocalist through her live performances during the Golden Age of Radio in the United States in the 1940s. Included among her most popular songs were "Adiós Mariquita Linda" as performed with Alfredo Antonini's Viva America Orchestra, "Cariñoso" as performed with Desi Arnaz and his orchestra, "Besos de Fuergo" and "Sonata Fantasía" among others.
Miss Chiquita Banana.
Miranda first appeared on the radio performing the promotional singing commercial "Chiquita Banana" in 1945. Her interpretation of the tropical tune proved to be immensely popular and was broadcast over 2,700 times per week. These commercial radio broadcasts created widespread notoriety for Miranda. She was also celebrated as one of the most popular models in the "Miss Chiquita Banana" contest during the 1940s, making several advertising and promotional film appearances on behalf of the Chiquita brand. She subsequently collaborated in various musical events representing the brand with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra during 1945 and 1946.
As a result of this exposure, Miranda soon emerged in a series of performances on radio networks in New York City. 
By 1946, she appeared on such network broadcasts as "The Jack Smith Show" on CBS and "Leave It To Mike" on Mutual. At this time she also engaged in a series of collaborations with noted interpreters of Latin American music in New York including Xavier Cugat on the "C-C Spotlight Bands" show for WOR radio and Alfredo Antonini on the "Viva America" show for the Columbia Broadcasting System and Voice of America. While performing on " Viva America" she also collaborated with several international musicians of that era including: the Mexican tenors Juan Arvizu and Nestor Mesta Chayres, the Argentine composer/arranger Terig Tucci and members of the CBS Pan American Orchestra including John Serry Sr.
Recording Latin American music in the United States.
Before long, Miranda engaged in a series of recordings in collaboration with leading conductors of Latin American music in the United States. Her performances included renditions of "Cariñoso", "Carnival in Rio", "I'll Never Love Again" and "Tia Juana" with the Desi Arnaz Orchestra for Victor Records in 1946 and 1947. 
They also included performances with Alfredo Antonini on recordings for Pilotone Records and Alpha Records which included: "Alma Llanera", "Silencio", "Music of the Americas" and "Songs and Dances of Latin America".
By 1947, Mianda also collaborated in Puerto Rican radio shows with Rafael Pont Flores, Elmo Torres Perez, Pepito Torres and his Siboney Orchestra and the Dúo Rodríguez-De Códova (Alicía and Adalberto, who once performed for WEMB).
Cinema.
As the 1950s emerged, Miranda appeared in the film "Captura Recomendada" as a musical performer with Carlos Ginés. She also appeared later in the decade in the film "Ensayo Final" (1955) in which she shared scenes with such actors as Carlos Ginés, Gloria Ferrandiz, Ricardo Lavié, Margarita Corona, Eduardo Rudy, Nathán Pinzon, Alberto Closas, Santiago Gómez Cou and Nelly Panizza. She also appeared on the television program "Tropicana Club" with Ángel Magaňa, Carlos Castro "Castrito" and Mario Pocoví. In addition, she collaborated in 1955 in "Comedias Musicales" with Pedro Quartucci, Perla Alvarado, Angel Eleta, Lita Moreno and Dorita Vernet. In 1952 she also appeared in the theater production of "Sonrisas y Melodías".
In addition to her recordings with the Alfredo Antonini Viva America Orchestra and the Desi Arnaz Orchestra, Miranda included several recordings of boleros with the Cuban René Touzet Orchestra for Seeco Records in her discography.
Miranda's musical performances on both radio and television were widely applauded by members of the public as well as professional critics of her time. For example, reviewers in "The Billboard" magazine specifically applauded Elsa Miranda for her sweet and spirited renditions of boleros. In addition, they cited her for the intimacy of her performances and her ability to contrast English and Spanish lyrics with such ease.
Death.
On 27 April 2007, Miranda passed away at the Madison Center in Old Bridge, New Jersey at the age of 85. Her cremated remains were buried in Calvary Cemetery in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. She is survived by her daughter, her sister, two granddaughters, and three great-grandchildren. Her musical legacy includes several single recordings of popular Latin American music from the Golden Age of Radio on major labels including: Columbia Records, Victor Records and Alpha Records.

App Store (tvOS)

The App Store is a digital distribution platform, developed and maintained by Apple Inc., for tvOS apps on its Apple TV digital media player. It was announced on September 9, 2015 at the Apple September 2015 event, alongside the 4th generation Apple TV.
Development.
tvOS ships with all-new development tools for developers. tvOS adds support for an all-new SDK for developers to build apps for the TV including all of the APIs included in iOS 9 such as Metal. It also adds an App Store which allows users to browse, download, and install a wide variety of applications. In addition, developers can now use their own interface inside of their application rather than only being able to use Apple's interface. Since tvOS is based on iOS, it is easy to port existing iOS apps to the Apple TV with Xcode while making only a few refinements to the app to better suit the larger screen. Apple provides Xcode free of charge to all registered Apple developers. To develop for the new Apple TV, it is necessary to make a parallax image for the application icon. In order to do this, Apple provides a Parallax exporter and previewer in the development tools for the Apple TV.

Jill Mann

Gillian Lesley "Jill" Mann, FBA (born 7 April 1943), is a scholar known for her work on medieval literature, especially on Middle English and Medieval Latin.
Education and career.
Mann was born in York, where her father was engaged in war work, but brought up in Sunderland, Co. Durham, where she was educated at the Bede Grammar School for Girls. In 1961 she won a place at St Anne's College, Oxford, and took her BA (1st Class Hons) in English Language and Literature in 1964. She began research work on the General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales in Oxford, but in 1967 she moved to Cambridge and eventually transferred to a Cambridge PhD, which she completed in 1971. She held a Research Fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, from 1968–1971; from 1971–1972 she taught medieval and some modern literature at the University of Kent at Canterbury. In 1972 she returned to Cambridge as an Official Fellow of Girton College, and in 1974 she was appointed to an Assistant Lectureship in the Faculty of English, upgraded to Lecturer in 1978. In 1988 she was elected Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English (Cambridge), a post which she held until 1998. She was Chair of the Faculty of English from 1993 to 1995, and helped the Faculty prepare for its first ever HEFCE teaching quality assessment. In 1998 she resigned the Cambridge Chair and took up a post as Notre Dame Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana; on taking early retirement in 2004, she was made an Emeritus Professor of Notre Dame. She is resident in Cambridge, and is a Life Fellow of Girton College.
Publications.
Mann's work has always had a strongly comparative character, bringing together texts in several medieval languages. Her dominant interests are the literature of fourteenth-century England, especially Chaucer, and medieval beast literature in Latin, French, and English. Her books include "Chaucer and Medieval Estates Satire" (1973), "Feminizing Chaucer" (2002), and "The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer" (edited with Piero Boitani); she also edited the "Canterbury Tales" for Penguin Classics. She produced an edition and translation of the Latin beast epic "Ysengrimus", with a lengthy account of the poem’s relation to its historical context in twelfth-century Flanders; she is currently working on an edition and translation of the "Speculum Stultorum", another twelfth-century Latin beast epic, written by a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury. She has published some 60 articles on medieval literature in English, Latin, French, and Italian; fifteen of them are collected in "Life in Words: Essays on Chaucer, the Gawain-Poet, and Malory", edited with a lengthy Introduction by Mark David Rasmussen analysing their contribution to medieval literary studies. Excerpts from her published work are frequently included in Norton Critical Editions and similar anthologies.

Unable to repay the money he has borrowed from Zamindar for his son Anand's (N.T.Rama Rao) higher studies, Sundaraiah (Vadlamani Viswanathan) commits suicide. A depressed Anand makes an aborted bid to kill the Zamindar and on the same night, he along with his friend Madan Mohan (Jaggaiah) stumble upon the corpse of an England-returned rich young man Paramanand (again N. T. Rama Rao), who resembles Anand. On Mohan's advice, Anand takes his place. The dead man's blind mother (Kakinada Rajaratnam) believes that Anand is her son and performs his marriage with Dayanidhi's class-conscious daughter Sarasa (Jamuna). Dayanidhi objects to his son Murthy (Ramasarma) marrying their servant-maid Amrutham (Anjali Devi) and tries to kill her by torching her hut. How Anand saves Amrutham, tames Sarasa and brings in a change of heart in Dayanidhi forms the rest of the story.

Monument to Sergey Kirov

Monument to Sergey Kirov () is a monument in the city of Rostov-on-Don, Rostov Oblast, Russia. It was opened in 1939.
Description.
The monument was created by sculptor Zinovy Vilensky and architect Viktor Barinov. The bronze figure with an risen right hand is set on a high pedestal made of red granite. Kirov is depicted with a kind smile and a cheerful face. On the pedestal there is inscribed a quote from the speech of Kirov, deliver at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Our successes are truly tremendous. The devil knows – to put it humanly, one wants just to live and live..."
History.
Sergei Mironovich Kirov was in Rostov in the spring of 1918. Then he participated in the First Congress of Soviets of the Don Republic.
The Monument to Kirov was opened on April 30, 1939. The monument was installed in the park, which was name after Kirov as well. Earlier in this square stood the Church of the Intercession, which was demolished in 1930. According to a city legend, the marble slabs remaining from the church were used as a material for the monument.
During the Great Patriotic War, the inhabitants of Rostov savedthe monument from destruction and buried it. Already in 1945 the monument was restored again.
The Monument to Kirov was previously declared an object of cultural heritage of Federal significance, but in 1997 its status was reduced to of Local significance.
In 2003 the Cossack Society "Don Cossack Host" wished to restore the Church of the Intercession at Kirov Square and move the monument to another place. This proposal was supported by Archbishop Panteleimon of Rostov and Novocherkassk. Members of CPRF and representatives of the Rostov branch of All-Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of History and Culture were against this idea. Public hearings were appointed, and as a result, it was decided to move the monument to the square which is situated at the corner of Kirovsky Avenue and Pushkinskaya Street.
In October 2005, the monument to Kirov was dismantled and moved to a workshop for restoration. In December of the same year, the monument was set in the new place.

Death of Elaine Herzberg

The death of Elaine Herzberg (August 2, 1968 – March 18, 2018) was the first recorded case of a pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car, after a collision that occurred late in the evening of March 18, 2018. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across a four-lane road in Tempe, Arizona, United States, when she was struck by an Uber test vehicle, which was operating in self-drive mode with a human safety backup driver sitting in the driving seat. Herzberg was taken to the local hospital where she died of her injuries.
Following the fatal incident, Uber suspended testing of self-driving vehicles in Arizona, where such testing had been sanctioned since August 2016. Uber chose not to renew its permit for testing self-driving vehicles in California when it expired at the end of March 2018.
Herzberg was the first pedestrian killed by a self-driving car; a driver had been killed by a semi-autonomous car almost two years earlier. She was not killed by an autonomous car (SAE level 4) because that car required a safety driver with a valid driver's license for operation and had not been cleared to operate without someone watching it. A reporter for "The Washington Post" compared Herzberg's fate with that of Bridget Driscoll who, in the United Kingdom in 1896, was the first pedestrian to be killed by an automobile. The Arizona incident has magnified the importance of collision avoidance systems for self-driving vehicles.
Collision summary.
Herzberg was crossing Mill Avenue (North) from west to east, approximately south of the intersection with Curry Road, outside the designated pedestrian crosswalk, close to the Red Mountain Freeway. She was pushing a bicycle laden with shopping bags, and had crossed at least two lanes of traffic when she was struck at approximately 9:58 pm MST () by a prototype Uber self-driving car based on a Volvo XC90, which was traveling north on Mill. The vehicle had been operating in autonomous mode since 9:39 pm, nineteen minutes before it struck and killed Herzberg. The car's human safety backup driver, Ms. Rafaela Vasquez, did not intervene in time to prevent the collision. Vehicle telemetry obtained after the crash showed that the human operator responded by moving the steering wheel less than a second before impact, and she engaged the brakes less than a second after impact.
Cause investigation.
The county district attorney's office recused itself from the investigation, due to a prior joint partnership with Uber promoting their services as an alternative to driving under the influence of alcohol.
Accounts of the crash have been conflicting in terms of the speed limit at the place of the accident. According to Tempe police the car was traveling in a zone, but this is contradicted by a posted speed limit of .
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sent a team of federal investigators to gather data from vehicle instruments, and to examine vehicle condition along with the actions taken by the safety driver. Their preliminary findings were substantiated by multiple event data recorders and proved the vehicle was traveling when Herzberg was first detected 6 seconds () before impact; during 4.7 seconds the self driving system did not infer that emergency braking was needed. A vehicle traveling can generally stop within once the brakes are applied. The machine needed to be 1.3 seconds () away prior to discerning that emergency braking was required, whereas at least that much distance was required to stop. The system failed to behave properly. A total stopping distance of 76 feet itself would imply a safe speed under . Human intervention was still legally required. Computer perception–reaction time would have been a speed limiting factor had the technology been superior to humans in ambiguous situations; however, the nascent computerized braking technology was disabled the day of the crash, and the machine's apparent 4.7-second perception–reaction (alarm) time allowed the car to travel . Video released by the police on March 21 showed the safety driver was not watching the road moments before the vehicle struck Herzberg.
Environment.
Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir was quoted stating the collision was "unavoidable" based on the initial police investigation, which included a review of the video captured by an onboard camera. Moir faulted Herzberg for crossing the road in an unsafe manner: "It is dangerous to cross roadways in the evening hour when well-illuminated, managed crosswalks are available." According to Uber, safety drivers were trained to keep their hands very close to the wheel all the time while driving the vehicle so they were ready to quickly take control if necessary.
Tempe police released video on March 21 showing footage recorded by two onboard cameras: one forward-looking, and one capturing the safety driver's actions. The forward-facing video shows that the self-driving car was traveling in the far right lane when it struck Herzberg. The driver-facing video shows the safety driver was looking down prior to the collision. The Uber operator is responsible for intervening and taking manual control when necessary as well as for monitoring diagnostic messages, which are displayed on a screen in the center console. In an interview conducted after the crash with NTSB, the driver stated she was monitoring the center stack at the time of the collision.
After the Uber video was released, journalist Carolyn Said noted the police explanation of Herzberg's path meant she had already crossed two lanes of traffic before she was struck by the autonomous vehicle. The Marquee Theatre and Tempe Town Lake are west of Mill Avenue, and pedestrians commonly cross mid-street without detouring north to the crosswalk at Curry. According to reporting by the "Phoenix New Times", Mill Avenue contains what appears to be a brick-paved path in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes; however, posted signs prohibit pedestrians from crossing in that location. When the second of the Mill Avenue bridges over the town lake was added in 1994 for northbound traffic, the X-shaped crossover in the median was installed to accommodate the potential closing of one of the two road bridges. The purpose of this brick-paved structure is purely to divert cars from one side to the other if a bridge is closed to traffic, and although it may look like a crosswalk for pedestrians, it is in fact a temporary roadway with vertical curbs and warning signs.
Software issues.
Michael Ramsey, a self-driving car expert with Gartner, characterized the video as showing "a complete failure of the system to recognize an obviously seen person who is visible for quite some distance in the frame. Uber has some serious explaining to do about why this person wasn't seen and why the system didn't engage."
James Arrowood, a lawyer specializing in driverless cars in Arizona, speculated that if the sensors were unable to determine it was a person they were detecting due to Herzberg walking her bicycle across the street, with the bicycle's metal parts between her and the sensors and thus the sensors interpreted her presence as that of another vehicle that was moving out of its right of way, the software may have decided to proceed after assuming that [the 'vehicle] Herzberg would yield the right of way. However, the context to his connecting statement in the footnoted article was left out of that article, as evidenced by the singular use of the word 'decided' rather than the entire statement, in the prefatory sentence in the article. Arizona law (ARS 28-793) states that pedestrians crossing the street outside a crosswalk shall yield to cars but it was not Arrowood's intent to suggest that the sensors would presume a person had to move rather than the vehicle needing to brake, rather, the statement's full context was that the driverless vehicle's sensors might not have recognized her as a person due to the interference from the bicycle. Per Arrowood, "The computer makes a decision. It says, 'Hey, there is this object moving 10 or 15 feet to left of me, do I move or not?' It (could be) programmed, I have a right of way, on the assumption that whatever is moving [presumably another vehicle] will yield the right of way." The NTSB preliminary report, however, noted that the software did order the car to brake 1.3 seconds before the collision.
A video shot from the vehicle's dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down, away from the road. It also appeared that the driver's hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car. Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties: one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety. When Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber's operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving.
The recorded telemetry showed the system had detected Herzberg six seconds before the crash, and classified her first as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and finally as a bicycle, each of which had a different predicted path according to the autonomy logic. 1.3 seconds prior to the impact, the system determined that emergency braking was required, which is normally performed by the vehicle operator. However, the system was not designed to alert the operator, and did not make an emergency stop on its own accord, as "emergency braking maneuvers are not enabled while the vehicle is under computer control, to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior", according to NTSB.
Sensor issues.
Brad Templeton, who provided consulting for autonomous driving competitor Waymo, noted the car was equipped with advanced sensors, including radar and LiDAR, which would not have been affected by the darkness. Templeton stated "I know the [sensor] technology is better than that, so I do feel that it must be Uber's failure." Arrowood also recognized potential sensor issues: "Really what we are going to ask is, at what point should or could those sensors recognize the movement off to the left. Presumably she was somewhere in the darkness."
In a press event conducted by Uber in Tempe in 2017, safety drivers touted the sensor technology, saying they were effective at anticipating jaywalkers, especially in the darkness, stopping the autonomous vehicles before the safety driver can even see pedestrians. However, manual intervention by the safety drivers was required to avoid a collision with another vehicle on at least one instance with a reporter from "The Arizona Republic" riding along.
Uber announced they would replace their Ford Fusion-based self-driving fleet with cars based on the Volvo XC90 in August 2016; the XC90s sold to Uber would be prepared to receive Uber's vehicle control hardware and software, but would not include any of Volvo's own advanced driver-assistance systems. Uber characterized the sensor suite attached to the Fusion as the "desktop" model, and the one attached to the XC90 as the "laptop", hoping to develop the "smartphone" soon. According to Uber, the suite for the XC90 was developed in approximately four months. The XC90 as modified by Uber included a single roof-mounted LiDAR sensor and 10 radar sensors, providing 360° coverage around the vehicle. In comparison, the Fusion had seven LiDAR sensors (including one mounted on the roof) and seven radar sensors. According to Velodyne, the supplier of Uber's LiDAR, the single roof-mounted LiDAR sensor has a narrow vertical range that prevents it from detecting obstacles low to the ground, creating a blind spot around the vehicle. Marta Hall, the president of Velodyne commented "If you're going to avoid pedestrians, you're going to need to have a side lidar to see those pedestrians and avoid them, especially at night." However, the augmented radar sensor suite would be able to detect obstacles in the LiDAR blind spot.
Distraction.
On Thursday, June 21, the Tempe Police Department released a detailed report along with media captured after the collision, including an audio recording of the 911 call made by the safety driver, Rafaela Vasquez and an initial on-scene interview with a responding officer, captured by body worn video. After the crash, police obtained search warrants for Vasquez's cellphones as well as records from the video streaming services Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu. The investigation concluded that because the data showed she was streaming "The Voice" over Hulu at the time of the collision, and the driver-facing camera in the Volvo showed "her face appears to react and show a smirk or laugh at various points during the time she is looking down", Vasquez may have been distracted from her primary job of monitoring road and vehicle conditions. Tempe police concluded the crash was "entirely avoidable" and faulted Vasquez for her "disregard for assigned job function to intervene in a hazardous situation".
Records indicate that streaming began at 9:16 pm and ended at 9:59 pm. Based on an examination of the video captured by the driver-facing camera, Vasquez was looking down toward her right knee 166 times for a total of 6 minutes, 47 seconds during the 21 minutes, 48 seconds preceding the crash. Just prior to the crash, Vasquez was looking at her lap for 5.3 seconds; she looked up half a second before the impact. Vasquez stated in her post-crash interview with the NTSB that she had been monitoring system messages on the center console, and that she did not use either one of her cell phones until she called 911. According to an unnamed Uber source, safety drivers are not responsible for monitoring diagnostic messages. Vasquez also told responding police officers she kept her hands near the steering wheel in preparation to take control if required, which contradicted the driver-facing video, which did not show her hands near the wheel. Police concluded that given the same conditions, Herzberg would have been visible to 85% of motorists at a distance of , 5.7 seconds before the car struck Herzberg. According to the police report, Vasquez should have been able to apply the brakes at least 0.57 seconds sooner, which would have provided Herzberg sufficient time to pass safely in front of the car.
The police report was turned over to the Yavapai County Attorney's Office for review of possible manslaughter charges. The Maricopa County Attorney's Office recused itself from prosecution over a potential conflict of interest, as it had earlier participated with Uber in a March 2016 campaign against drunk driving. On March 4, 2019 Yavapai County Attorney released a letter indicating there is "no basis for criminal liability" against Uber Corporation; that potential charges against the driver should be further investigated by Maricopa County Attorney; and that the Tempe Police Department should analyze the case to gather additional evidence.
Other factors.
According to the preliminary report of the collision released by the NTSB, Herzberg had tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana in a toxicology test carried out after the collision. Residual toxicology itself does not establish if or when she was under their influence, and hence an actual factor. Inhibited faculties can hypothetically factor into one's relative ability for last-minute self-preservation. However, her mere presence on the roadway far in the distance ahead of the car was the factor which invoked the machine's duty to brake; the common legal duty to avoid her and other objects being general and preexisting.
On May 24, NTSB released a preliminary incident report, the news release saying that Herzberg "was dressed in dark clothing, did not look in the direction of the vehicle... crossed... in a section not directly illuminated by lighting... entered the roadway from a brick median, where signs...warn pedestrians to use a crosswalk... 360 feet north." Six seconds before impact, the vehicle was traveling , and the system identified the woman and bicycle as an unknown object, next as a vehicle, then as a bicycle. At 1.3 seconds before hitting the pedestrian and her bike, the system flagged the need for emergency braking, but it failed to do so, as the car hit Herzberg at .
The forward-looking Uber dashcam did not pick up Herzberg until approximately 1.4 seconds before the collision, suggesting (as the sheriff did) that the crash may have been completely unavoidable even if Vasquez hadn't been distracted in the seconds leading up to the crash.
However, night-time video shot by other motorists in the days following the crash, plus their comments, suggest that the area may have been better illuminated than the dashcam footage, viewed in isolation would suggest. This raises the possibility that Herzberg's appearing so late in the Uber video could merely be an indication that the camera had insufficient sensitivity or was otherwise poorly calibrated for the environment and setting in which it was operating. If these crowd-sourced re-creations are indeed representative of the visibility conditions on the actual night that the accident occurred, then Herzberg would have been visible to Vasquez as soon as there was a clear sight line had Vasquez only been looking ahead, refuting the assertion that the accident was unavoidable.
Complicating things even further, there is evidence that suggests the discrepancies in visibility between the dashcam footage and the civilian re-creation submissions are not at all invented or illusory, but are, instead, real phenomena whose progenitor is purported to be the set of severely under-powered headlights installed on the car Vasquez was monitoring. While all of these potential scenarios will likely affect any charging decisions and/or other legal actions (if they materialize at all), none currently have any objective validation or otherwise meaningful support, especially in relation to one another.
Coordination with state government.
Prior to the fatal incident, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey had encouraged Uber to enter the state. He signed Executive Order 2015-09 on August 25, 2015, entitled "Self-Driving Vehicle Testing and Piloting in the State of Arizona; Self-Driving Vehicle Oversight Committee", establishing a welcoming attitude to autonomous vehicle testing. According to Ducey's office, the committee, which consists of eight state employees appointed by the governor, has met twice since it was formed.
In December 2016, Ducey had released a statement welcoming Uber's autonomous cars: "Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads. While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses." Emails between Uber and the office of the governor showed that Ducey was informed that the testing of self-driving vehicles would begin in August 2016, several months ahead of the official announcement welcoming Uber in December. On March 1, 2018, Ducey signed Executive Order (XO) 2018-04, outlining regulations for autonomous vehicles. Notably, XO 2018-04 requires the company testing self-driving cars to provide a written statement that "the fully autonomous vehicle will achieve a minimal risk condition" if a failure occurs.
Aftermath.
Uber.
After the collision that killed Herzberg on March 18, 2018, Uber ceased testing self-driving vehicles in all four cities (Tempe, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Toronto) where it had deployed them. On March 26, Governor Ducey sent a letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, suspending Uber's testing of self-driving cars in the state. In the letter, Ducey stated "As governor, my top priority is public safety. Improving public safety has always been the emphasis of Arizona's approach to autonomous vehicle testing, and my expectation is that public safety is also the top priority for all who operate this technology in the state of Arizona." Uber also announced it would not renew its permit to test self-driving cars in California after the California Department of Motor Vehicles wrote to inform Uber that its permit would expire on March 31, and "any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona" would have to be addressed before the permit could be renewed. Uber acknowledged that mistakes were made in its brash pursuit to ultimately create a safer driving environment.
Later in the year, Uber issued a reflective 70-page safety report in which Uber stated the potential for its self-driving cars to be safer than those driven by humans, however some of their employees worry that Uber is taking shortcuts to hit internal milestones. To be legal in all states for private use, or anywhere at the commercial level, the technology must hard code assured clear distance ahead driving.
Uber returned their self-driving cars to the roads in public testing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 20, 2018. Uber said they received authorization from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Uber said they were also pursuing the same with cars on roads in San Francisco, California and Toronto, Ontario. In December 2020, Uber sold its Advanced Technologies Group, which was researching automated driving systems, to Aurora Innovation.
Other companies.
The incident also caused other companies to temporarily cease road testing of self-driving vehicles. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated "We don't know that we would do anything different, but we should give ourselves time to see if we can learn from that incident."
Legal actions.
Legal woes for Uber were among the collision fallout. Herzberg's daughter retained the law firm Bellah Perez, and together with the husband quickly reached an undisclosed settlement on March 28 while local and federal authorities continued their investigation. Herzberg's mother, father, and son also retained legal counsel. While a confidential settlement buried the liability issue, it suggested a sufficient legal cause of action. The abundance of event data recorders left few questions of fact for a jury to decide.
Although the Yavapai County Attorney declined to charge Uber with a criminal violation in 2019 for the death of Herzberg, a Maricopa County grand jury indicted the safety driver on one count of negligent homicide in 2020. Her trial was planned for February 2021, but has been delayed because the case was designated "complex" and the discovery process is ongoing.
Regulation.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the American Automobile Association had previously identified nighttime driving as an area for safety improvement. This follows similar changes in attitudes against tolerating drunk driving, starting in the late 1970s through the 1990s, and has occurred in concert with a cultural shift towards active lifestyles and multi-modal use of roadways which has been formally adopted by the National Association of City Transportation Officials.

John Aitken (biologist)

Robert John Aitken (born 4 September 1947) is a British reproductive biologist, widely known for identifying oxidative stress as a significant contribution to infertility and its actions on human sperm function. He also made substantial contributions to clinical practice translation in male reproductive health, notably the development of new contraceptive vaccine.
He was born in Bath, England but moved to Australia in 1997, where he took Chair of Biological Sciences at the University of Newcastle, then nominated to Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Faculty of Health and Medicine and Laureate Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Newcastle since 2013. He is currently Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences, a former president of the International Society of Andrology. Aitken also founded and directed the Priority Research Centre in Reproduction at the University of Newcastle, where he and his colleagues work on a broad spectrum of reproductive issues from conception to parturition.
Aitken has received many honours for his contributions to science throughout his career, including the Carl G. Hartman Award and the 2012 NSW Scientist.
Early life and education.
Aitken was born in Bath, in England, on 4 September 1947. Born into a family of real estate agents in Devon, he attended Barnstaple Boys Grammar School, but quit at the age of 16 to follow his parents' footsteps and become an estate agent. After six months of selling houses to the semi-rural residents of Barnstaple, Aitken decided to return to school. He then re-enrolled at his former school to study art, English, and geography, but they were all full, so he had no choice but to study chemistry, botany, and zoology, despite his initial intention to avoid science.
Aitken graduated from the University of London, where he received a Bachelor of Science (Special Honours) in 1967. While at university, he studied zoology, specifically elephant reproduction, which made him interested in reproductive biology, prompting him to pursue a Master's degree in Embryology and Mammalian Reproduction from the University College of North Wales in 1969.
He continued his post-graduate studies focusing on wild animal reproduction in Veterinary Clinical Studies at the University of Cambridge under Professor Roger Short's supervision.
First scientific papers.
In 1971, Aitken's first paper, "Ultrastructural changes in the uterine glands of the Roe deer during delayed implantation” was published in the Journal of Physiology. After 4 years working with Dr Roger Short, Aitken completed his thesis, and received a PhD for research on reproductive study in roe deer from the University of Cambridge in 1973.
Scientific career.
1973–1976: first start on research career.
After Cambridge, Aitken started a postdoctoral position at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Animal Genetics, working collaboratively with Anne McLaren, a graduate from the University of Oxford. However, for the first 12 months at Edinburgh, he had not done any outstanding research due to transformations in study models from descriptive on wild animals to mechanistic approaches using the mouse, as well as changes in laboratories. Despite initial difficulties, he became familiar with new study models of in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer in the second year. In later years, combining these techniques with electrophoretic analysis of proteins, his publication rate rose dramatically and was being cited by other scientists at that time.
WHO mission.
In late 1975, Aitken was invited to study problems associated with fertility regulation at the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s Human Reproduction Unit in Geneva. As consulting scientists of WHO, he and Mike Harper conducted several reviews on fertility control strategies, which help prevent or disrupt implantation.
Returning from the WHO informative sessions, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bordeaux for 1 year before continuing his research activities at the University of Edinburgh in September 1977.
1977–1981: human reproductive study.
Despite a short period at WHO, Aitken had the opportunity to consider all the problems that concern human health, particular infertility issue, during his time here, which prompted him to pursue research in human reproductive biology.
In 1977, Aitken had been appointed to the first Medical Research Council Centre for Reproductive Health at University of Edinburgh, where he and his team focused on the biochemistry of implantation. During his early days at the newly founded centre, he found an advanced technique for examining proteins and carbohydrates more precisely during the pre-ovulatory period to study hormonal control of implantation. Despite early achievements, his team had suspended all research activities due to material shortage from gynaecology wards.
1982–1998: initiative in andrology.
After months of waiting for clinical supplies, Aitken took the lead in Andrology with Roger Short and David Mortimer's encouragement, despite the fact that the discipline was still in its infancy around the 1950s. With this transition in research styles, he could gain direct access without relying on his clinical colleagues' supply, thus solving the need for clinical materials. In 1982, he was promoted to senior scientist at the Medical Research Council; however, it was initially difficult since he and his team were all obscure about how they could influence this field. After few years with renovated laboratory facilities, Aitken started to focus his future study on clinical research into male contraceptives, androgen physiology, and male infertility, especially molecular mechanisms that regulate sperm function.
Aitken remained at the University of Edinburgh for most of the 1980s to 1990s. It was there that he discovered an abnormally free radical attack in failures of fertilisation and later did research on the relationship between reactive oxygen species and their effects on impaired sperm function. He also proposed new techniques in contraception that had helped prevent sexually transmitted diseases and treat male infertility. These contributions laid the foundation for the reproductive studies done in the latter half of the twentieth century and later.
Oxidative stress.
During the time at the University of Edinburgh, Aitken worked with multiple antibodies to analyse their effects on fertilisation and human sperm function. When he gave the administration of A23187 to spermatozoa from normal fertile and oligospermia, he discovered a decline in fertilisation rates at a higher dose, which reduced sperm motility. In attempt to explain the cellular basis of defective sperm function association in a 1987 paper in the "Journal of Reproduction and Fertility", he found a sudden burst of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with the free radical attack in male infertility. The hyperactive production of ROS causes peroxidative damage to the sperm plasma membrane, which is known as oxidative stress, resulting in loss of sperm function.
The discovery was later acknowledged by thousands of scientists as a foundational concept in studying oxygen species associated pathophysiology. Aitken's paper had expanded on the molecular modifications of oxidants in male infertility and resulted in new therapeutic intervention methods to maintain reproductive function.
Contraceptive vaccine.
Besides discovering oxidative stress, Aitken also improved the male contraceptive vaccine in later years. His paper in the European Journal of Pharmacology in 1990 proposed 3 possible targets, including hCG, zona pellucida and sperm surface for contraception development. This research provided the foundation for designing a long-lasting and reversible form of contraceptives, providing an effective method to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases and control the world's growing population.
1998–2004: emigration to Australia.
The University of Cambridge awarded Aitken a Doctor of Science (ScD) in 1998 to recognise his achievements in gamete biology. At the same time, he got a phone call from the University of Newcastle, inviting him to take up the Chair of Biological Sciences. He first declined because he mistook Newcastle for Newcastle upon Tyne, but then agreed after learning that the university is in Australia. It was here that he later took part in several important roles such as Head of School, Director of an ARC Centre of Excellence then Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Faculty of Health and Medicine at the University of Newcastle.
While serving high positions at the University of Newcastle, Aitken continued his research career on the reproductive studies. He and his colleagues conducted further research on the effects of oxidative stress on the physiological and functional integrity of human sperm. They also researched related oxidative stress problems, such as genetic alterations in male infertility, which culminated in gene mutations, discussing the possible health issues of the next generation from couples using assisted reproductive technology.
He and his colleagues continued to research safe and reliable contraception vaccinations for controlling human fertility. Their study included developing the potential contraceptive potential of ZP3 peptides and other chemical compositions of these contraceptive agents, implying the potential effectiveness of the anti-hCG antibodies.
During his early years in Australia, Aitken attempted to diverge his studies from human reproductive science. He released articles that helped identify diseases in various Australian species, including Tammar Wallaby and Brushtail possum. In addition, he discovered Ehrlichia platys in dogs in Australia, which had not previously been found in Australian animals. However, after few years, he decided to return to andrology and the pursuit of understanding the cell biology of spermatozoa.
2005–2018.
According to Google Scholar, this is the period where Aitken's papers were receiving an increasing number of citations. During this time, Aitken and his team carried out some studies to identify different causes affecting male reproductive health. They found that environmental conditions such as smoking, toxins, and mobile radiation contribute to various health issues. These not simply affect male fertility by causing oxidative stress, but they also cause DNA damage, increasing the risk of a man's children developing infertility or cancer.
Along with the studies on DNA integrity, the effect of radiofrequency radiation on fertility, contraceptive and fertility preservation in patients, Aitken has been working on molecular markers of oxidative stress and developing sensitive methods to measure reactive oxygen species generation by cells. Their discovery showed the effectiveness of numerous diagnostic techniques, such as chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry, and flow cytometry, as an indicator of oxidative stress, emphasizing the general significance of mitochondrial dysregulation in impaired sperm activity.
Despite not gaining much success in the animal study, his contribution to developing immunocontraception on animals ranging from horses, sub-mammalian organisms to annelid worms, oysters, and fish enabled the development of a nonsurgical sterilization technique. In 2015, he received a patent for his "Method for reducing the Reproductive Potential of an Animal" while working with Eileen McLaughlin. His invention revolutionized Australian horse breeding industry, which provided a new method of controlling the horse population and increase their value.
2018–current.
In the more recent years, Aitken has been focusing on translational research in male contraception and male infertility. Since 2016, he has been working alongside Memphasis to develop "Felix", a device which uses a patented cell separation technology to more gently and effectively separate sperm from semen samples. This project seeks to increase the collection of vital, stable sperm during the crucial early stages of the IVF process.
Other interests.
Aitken's cultural interests go beyond science. 
Music.
Before deciding to pursue a career as a scientist, music was his greatest passion. He played guitar most of the time during his time at University of London, and joined the university's folk music club. He loved the music of Frank Sinatra, Nelson Riddle Orchestra and especially Bob Dylan.

Old Music and the Slave Women

"Old Music and the Slave Women" is a science fiction story by Ursula K. Le Guin. It was first published in the 1999 collection "Far Horizons", edited by Robert Silverberg, and anthologized multiple times in collections of Le Guin's works. The story is set on the planet of Werel in the fictional Hainish universe, created by Le Guin. That planetary system is also the setting for Le Guin's 1995 story suite "Four Ways to Forgiveness". The economy of Werel is based on slavery, and during the period in which the stories are set, the society is experiencing upheaval and revolution.
"Old Music and the Slave Women" tells the story of Sohikelwenyanmurkeres Esdan, a native of Hain, nicknamed "Old Music", who appears as a peripheral character in three of the previous stories set in that system. Fed up with a civil war on Werel which has trapped him in the embassy of the Ekumen, he leaves to meet with the leaders of the revolution, but is captured and taken to an old slave estate. There, he is tortured by government agents, and befriends the few women slaves who remain.
As with the stories of the linked story suite, "Old Music and the Slave Women" examines themes related to revolution and reconstruction in slave society. It explores the consequences of war and responses to violence, and suggests that cultural change is a gradual process. The story was positively received. While the length of the story received some criticism, reviewers praised the character of Esdan and Le Guin's depiction of the culture of Werel, with one critic describing it as "painfully real, at once beautiful and deplorable."
Setting.
"Old Music and the Slave Women" takes place in the fictional Hainish universe, created by Le Guin. In the alternative history of this universe, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Earth and Gethen, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. "Old Music and the Slave Women" is set in a planetary system that includes two habitable planets, Werel and Yeowe, which were also the setting for Le Guin's 1995 story cycle "Four Ways to Forgiveness". The economy of the system was based on slavery, and is depicted as undergoing upheaval and revolution during the period in which the stories are set.
The story follows Sohikelwenyanmurkeres Esdan, a native of Hain, nicknamed "Esdardon Aya", or "Old Music" in the local language. Esdardon Aya appears as a character in three of the four stories in "Four Ways to Forgiveness". By the events of "Old Music and the Slave Women", he has lived on Werel for 33 years. "Old Music and the Slave Women" is set after the four previous stories in the internal chronology of the universe, and tells of a civil war on Werel. Slavery is permitted on the lands held by the government, and seven eighths of the population is enslaved. "Old Music and the Slave Women" takes place three years after an uprising of slaves takes place. Le Guin stated that the story was inspired by a visit to a large plantation in Charleston, South Carolina, that had used slave labor. The garden, house, and haunted ground in the story were inspired by what Le Guin referred to as a "beautiful, terrible place."
Plot summary.
Sohikelwenyanmurkeres Esdan serves as the chief of intelligence for the embassy of the Ekumen to Werel. During a civil war on the planet, the government cuts the embassy off from access to the outside world. Esdan is clandestinely approached by messengers of the rebellion, asking officials of the Ekumen to visit them. Esdan, bored by his isolation, volunteers to make the journey across the government lines. He is intercepted by government forces as he attempts to cross into rebel territory, roughed up, and imprisoned on a large slave estate, where he is tortured. He is nursed by an elderly woman slave, and his injuries later treated by another, named Gana. Rayaye, a minister of the government visits him, and offers him his freedom if he helps the government in the civil war.
Recovering from his injuries, Esdan is permitted to wander the gardens of the estate, which remind him of his home on Hain. He makes the acquaintance of Kamsa, a slave woman who has a son from being raped by an owner. He speaks with Rayaye again, and guesses that the war is going badly for the government. Rayaye tells him that the government is considering the use of a biological weapon to end the conflict, and that it wants the consent of the Ekumen to do so. After Rayaye leaves again, Esdan is locked indoors, leading him to guess that the liberation army of the slave rebellion is close. Later that day he hears sounds of fighting, and is released from his room by members of the liberation army, who have stormed the estate and killed the government soldiers holding it. He is cross-examined by the men who released him; he tells them that the government wanted him to express support for it on behalf of the Ekumen.
The rebel officers tell him that they want him to warn the government not to use the biological weapon, and that if it did the Ekumen would send troops against the government. Esdan informs them that the Ekumen does not have an army, and even if it did it would take many years to arrive, due to the interstellar distances involved. He worries that he may be caught up in a factional struggle within the liberation army. Esdan tries to persuade the officers to care for the slaves still in the estate, including the ones who cared for him. A rebel marshal, Metoy, promises to care for the slaves. Another of the rebel officers later demands that Esdan threaten the government on behalf of the rebels. Esdan replies that he considers himself a prisoner of war. That night, when Kamsa brings Esdan food, fighting breaks out outside the building. Kamsa leads Esdan to a bolthole where the other household slaves are also hiding.
After waiting there for many hours, Esdan leaves their shelter and returns to the house, which he finds has been bombed. He comes across some slaves who work the fields, who tell him that everyone who was in the house is dead, but for one. Metoy has been seriously injured but is still alive. Most of the slaves leave the compound to try and reach the liberation army sooner. The slaves from the house remain, afraid to undertake a journey with a baby. Esdan and Metoy remain with them, expecting the rebellion to reach them too.
Themes.
"Old Music and the Slave Women" shares both characters and thematic links with the stories of "Four Ways to Forgiveness", which together describe revolution and reconstruction in slave society. Le Guin herself described the story as a "fifth way to forgiveness". The torture undergone by Esdan is similar to the experiences of Solly in "Forgiveness Day", the first story of "Four Ways to Forgiveness". Both their experiences bring them a better understanding of themselves and those around them. Esdan's development over the course of the story is similar to that of Havzhiva in "A Man of the People". Both protagonists undergo journeys through the "wilderness" over the course of the story; in Esdan's case, the wilderness is a planet he has lived on for a long while, that has been torn apart by war. As with Havzhiva, the isolation caused by this journey helps him find companionship among the people he meets.
The 2016 Le Guin collection "The Found and the Lost" included three of the four stories from "Four Ways to Forgiveness" alongside "Old Music and the Slave Women". "Tor.com" described the four stories, clustered in the middle of the volume, as focusing on "different experience[s] of a crumbling society", and as the "collection's clearest instance of Le Guin’s ongoing literary project of intersectional justice". Scholar Warren Rochelle states that the five interconnected stories set on Werel and Yeowe describe a society that has the potential to build a "truly human community", and the possibility of utopia. This is made possible by the Ekumen's recognition of the slaves as human beings, thus offering them the prospect of freedom. Rochelle argues that "Old Music and the Slave Women" juxtaposes two ideas of utopia. For the slaves, utopia is freedom, the possibility of which is brought about by the revolution. For the masters, utopia is represented by the estate as it used to be, run by thousands of slaves: Rochelle compares this concept of utopia to the fictional titular city of Le Guin's fable "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas".
According to scholar Mike Cadden, silence is a recurring theme in the story. "Old Music and the Slave Women" begins with Esdan being cut off inside the embassy. When he attempts to escape in order to refute propaganda that the Ekumen has taken the side of the government, he is captured, and in captivity realizes that his safety lies in silence and circumspection. The torture he undergoes is not meant to force him to reveal information, but to "silence him further through humiliation". Cadden writes that Esdan eventually finds a sense of community among the slaves, who are also victims of the war. Cadden described the story as sharing similarities with Le Guin's works set in Orsinia.
Scholar Sandra Lindow writes that "Old Music and the Slave Women" continued Le Guin's exploration of peaceful responses to violence and war. Through the story Le Guin suggests that during times of violence no one is immune to it, such as when Esdan states that "In war everybody is a prisoner". Lindow describes Esdan as Le Guin's "wisest, most compassionate protagonist." His insight into the deprivation experienced by the slave women also gives him insight into the process of cultural change. He realizes that he has to put aside his "pure idea of liberty" and take part in a slow process of shifting individual opinions to create cultural change. In his words, he seeks to "muddle the nobly simple structure of the hierarchy of caste by infecting it with the idea of justice. And then to confuse the nobly simple structure of the ideal of human equality by trying to make it real."
As with many other works by Le Guin, "Old Music and the Slave Women" has been described as demonstrating the influence of Taoism on Le Guin's work. Scholar Alexis Lothian wrote that in Le Guin's world, social change was a gradual process: despite the slave revolution, the ideology of the slave-owners was still a powerful force. Though the slaves wait for utopia in the form of the freedom brought by the revolution, they find that they are caught in the "insanity, the stupidity, the meaningless brutality" of the actual liberation. Le Guin instead suggests that utopia or liberation is found equally in the small acts of kindness and comfort which Esdan and the slave women share. Thus according to Rochelle, Le Guin's version of true community "is one of the heart, in which each person’s story is honoured."
Publication and reception.
"Old Music and the Slave Women" was first published in the 1999 collection "Far Horizons", edited by Robert Silverberg, and published by Avon Eos. It was later collected along with five other stories of the Hainish Cycle, the short story "The Birthday of the World" and the novella "Paradises Lost" in the 2002 collection "The Birthday of the World and Other Stories", published by Harper Collins. In 2016 it was published in the collection "The Found and the Lost", along with twelve other stories by Le Guin. The volume was marketed as "The Collected Novellas of Ursula K. Le Guin." Penguin Random House published "Five Ways to Forgiveness", a collection including the "Old Music and the Slave Women" and the four stories from "Four Ways to Forgiveness", as an eBook in 2017.
In the foreword to "The Birthday of the World" collection, Le Guin stated that she had been the subject of a critic's scorn for writing about slavery; in response, Le Guin asked "I wonder what planet he lives on?" Reviewing "The Birthday of the World" collection for the "New York Review of Books", Canadian author Margaret Atwood wrote that the setting and inspiration of "Old Music and the Slave Women" brought it "very close to home". Atwood stated that this story provided the strongest demonstration of Le Guin's belief that science fiction reflects the real world; according to Atwood, the story could have reflected any society in the midst of war. Referring to Le Guin as usually being a "a movingly lyrical writer", Atwood stated that the story didn't "[shy] away from necessary gore".
Reviewing "Far Horizons" for the "Washington Post", Richard Grant was more circumspect about the story, stating "readers unfamiliar with [Le Guin's] oeuvre" may not have found the story "easily approachable." The science fiction magazine "Strange Horizons" stated that "Old Music and the Slave Women" was a "middling" Le Guin story, which made it a "fine [work] by most authors' standards." A review of "The Found and the Lost" in the science fiction magazine "Tor.com" offered high praise to the collection, stating that it found "Le Guin at her most formidable." It praised the four stories set on Werel in particular, stating that the "richness of the culture Le Guin depicts is painfully real, at once beautiful and deplorable." The review concluded that Le Guin's "ability to make not only her outsider-protagonists at home in this degraded world, but her "enlightened" readers, is a feat that should not be overlooked."
Science fiction critic John Clute wrote that the story was less substantive than some of the other works of the "Birthday of the World" collection, saying that it occupied "radically more space than it needed". He suggested that there was a "surfeit of sentences" that did not move the story forward, and referred to them as a "flag of inattention". He was more positive about Le Guin's writing, stating that Esdan was a "wise and deeply attractive man" and the culture of the slaves was "acutely anatomized", while "every sentence is balanced, [and] laid out with high inconspicuous craft". He wrote that the "astonishing beauty" of the slave estate depicted by Le Guin raised "pertinent issues about the creation of great beauty out of great evil."

Spencer Lee

Spencer Richard Lee (born October 14, 1998) is an American freestyle and folkstyle wrestler who competes at 57 kilograms (125 pounds). In freestyle, he was the '19 US National champion and a three–time age–group World Champion, once as a cadet and twice as a junior. As a folkstyle wrestler, Lee has won the James E. Sullivan Award and the Dan Hodge Trophy twice, as well as being a three-time NCAA Division I National Champion and a two-time Big Ten Conference champion out of the University of Iowa. He was also the top-recruit as a high school wrestler at the time of his commitment. Lee is often considered one of the most dominant athletes in college athletics.
Folkstyle career.
Background.
Lee was born in Denver, Colorado but grew up in Saegertown, Pennsylvania. He would end up moving again to Murrysville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Franklin Regional High School.
High school.
In Lee's freshman year he ended the season undefeated with a record of 49-0 and a state title at 113-pounds. As a sophomore, he also ended the season with a similar 48–0 record and a state championship now at 120-pounds. As a junior in high school, he also competed at 120-pounds, posting a perfect 12–0 record and winning state again, making him a three-time PIAA champion. As a senior, he also stayed undefeated during regular-season, competing at 132-pounds and eventually at 126-pounds. Going into the state finals, Lee was the pound for pound top-ranked high school wrestler and was undefeated, posting a 144–0 record in his high school career. At the finals, Lee faced the same wrestler he had beaten by technical fall at the previous year's state finals and current Iowa teammate, Austin DeSanto. The match was very close and exciting, having the crowd cheering on their feet. With Lee being up 5–4, DeSanto secured a last-second takedown, winning 6-5 and pulling up the biggest upset of the century in high school wrestling.
As the top-recruit in the country, Lee had many offers from many Division I colleges, but ended up choosing the University of Iowa.
College.
2017-18.
Lee chose not to redshirt in his first year and competed as a true freshman instead. He had immediate success, posting a 14–1 record in regular-season. He placed third at the Big Ten Conference Championships and competed at the NCAA's. At the National tournament, Lee looked absolutely dominant, winning by technical fall by 18 points to 0 in his first two bouts in less than 6 minutes combined. After that, he pinned that year's Big 12 Champion Nick Piccininni and former NCAA Champion Nathan Tomasello, reaching the finals. At the finals, he faced Nick Suriano, who has been undefeated in 2017–2018. Lee was able to defeat Suriano 5 points to 1. This result earned him the NCAA championship at 125-pounds as a true freshman, the first for the University of Iowa since Lincoln McIlravy in 1993.
2018-19.
Lee posted an overall record of 23–3, placed second at the Big Ten Championships and competed at the NCAA championships as a sophomore. At the Nationals, Lee was as dominant as the previous year, winning by technical fall (18-0) in his first bout, major decision (10-1) in the second and fall in the third. In his next two bouts, he defeated three-time Big 12 Champion Nick Piccininni and ACC runner-up Jack Mueller, winning the NCAA Championship at 125-pounds. Lee outscored opponents 55–7 in five matches at the NCAA Championships.
2019-20.
In his junior year, Lee had the option to take an Olympic redshirt, but chose not to, stating he wanted to help the Iowa Team to win an NCAA title but he would still compete in freestyle. During regular season, he compiled a record of 15–0 with 14 of those wins bringing bonus points to the team. At the Big Ten tournament, Lee dominated his way to the finals, winning by fall inside 3 minutes in his first bout and by technical superiority (19-3) in the semifinals, making his way to the finale. In the finals, Lee defeated the #2 ranked wrestler at 125-pounds, Devin Schroder of Purdue University, via major decision (16-2) and qualified for the NCAA's. Lee was the #1 seed and a big favorite to win the championship, however, the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making Lee and all the qualifiers unable to compete. Overall, Lee remained undefeated with a record of 18–0 through the season and outscored his opponents 234–18. Due to this, Lee received the prestigious Dan Hodge Trophy as the best collegiate wrestler of the season and was named "Big Ten Wrestler of the Year". In April, Lee received the prestigious James E. Sullivan Award as the most outstanding athlete in the United States of America.
2020-21.
In October 2020, the NCAA granted an extra year of eligibility to winter athletes due to the last season being cut short, giving Lee the possibility of becoming a four-time NCAA champion. During regular season, Lee racked up an undefeated 4–0 record, with all of his victories coming via fall in the first period. On February 8, it was announced that the Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling team had suspended all team related activities during regular season due to COVID-19 results. During post-season, Lee claimed his second back-to-back Big Ten Conference championship, earning a dominant technical fall over Devin Schroder in the finale. Afterwards, he was named the "Big Ten Wrestler of the Year" for the second straight time. At the NCAA championships, Lee continued his dominance and made his way to the finals with all of his four victories coming with high-scoring bonus points. In the finale, he faced the third seed from Arizona State Brandon Courtney, whom he was unable to get bonus points out off despite dominating him and not allowing him to score any points of his own, claiming his third NCAA title. Lee later revealed he had torn his left ACL eight days before the tournament to match a torn right ACL suffered in the second period of the 2019 NCAA final against Mueller, but competed anyway and was successful by dominating the opposition. After the season, Lee was named the Dan Hodge Trophy winner (shared with heavyweight Gable Steveson) for the second straight season.
2021-22.
Lee remains to have a year left of eligibility, as granted by the NCAA, despite competing as a senior in the season prior.
Freestyle career.
Age-group.
Lee was a highly successful age-group wrestler. In 2013, he made the US Cadet World Team by winning the US National title, notably defeating eventual NCAA champion Austin O' Connor and eventual '14 Youth Olympic silver medalist Daton Fix, and went on to place seventh at the World Championships. In 2014, he once again made the US Cadet World Team and went on to dominate the opposition at the World Championships, tech'ing and pinning his way to becoming a Cadet World Champion. In 2015, Lee moved up from 50 kilograms to 54 kilograms for the US Cadet National Championships, however, he was stopped twice by Daton Fix, losing his chance at the spot.
After failing to make the team, the 16-year-old Lee went back to 50 kilograms and made the US Junior World Team, tech'ing every opponent at the World Team Trials. At the World Championships, Lee showed no struggle in the junior level, once again tech'ing his way to becoming now a Junior World Champion. In 2016, Lee started off by winning the US Open, followed up making his fourth US World Team and represented the US at the Junior World Championships once again. In his last age-group showdown, Lee dominated the field on his way to the finals, before facing Kurshid Parpiev from Kyrgyzstan. In the finale, Lee went a full six-minute match for the first time in the junior level, and was forced to dig dip as his opponent held the lead after the first round, but Lee was able to scored eleven points of his own against Parpiev's five in the second period to edge the gold medal and become a two-time Junior World Champion.
Senior level.
2019.
After more than three years of inactivity in freestyle, with his last showdown coming from his gold medal performance at the '16 Junior World Championships, the 21-year-old Lee registered to make his senior level debut at the Senior Nationals in December. In his first three senior matches, Lee outscored his opponents 30–0, including a flawless victory over NCAA champion Darian Cruz, to advance to the semifinals, where he faced the freshly crowned Junior World Championship silver medalist Vito Arujau, and despite making it more competitive, Arujau scoring four points, he was also shut down by Lee's ability and surrendered to a 14–4 technical fall. In the finale, Lee faced NCAA champion and four-time Big Ten Conference Champion Nathan Tomasello, whom he was also able to defeat with a lopsided decision, claiming the US National Championship.
2020–2021.
The 2019 NCAA and US National champion, Lee was scheduled to compete at the US Olympic Team Trials on April 4 at State College, Pennsylvania. However, the event was postponed for 2021 along with the Summer Olympics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving all the qualifiers unable to compete until the next year. In his only match of the year, Lee pinned four–time DI All-American Zach Sanders on November 1 at the HWC Open I.
After claiming his third NCAA title in March 20, 2021, Lee's participation at the rescheduled US Olympic Team Trials was put on doubt after he revealed he had torn his left ACL, leaving him with no properly functioning ACLs since his right one had already been torn earlier in his career. On March 26, Lee announced that he had taken the decision of withdrawing from the Olympic Trials in order to properly recover from his injuries.

Graoully

In French folklore, the Graoully (spelled as Graouli, Graouilly, Graouille or Graully) is a creature with the appearance of a dragon. According to legend, it lived in the arena of the Roman amphitheater in Metz, France. Legends state that Saint Clement of Metz fought against Graoully and vanquished the beast.
Etymology.
It is believed that the word Graoully derives from the French word "grouiller" meaning "swarm". This has been attributed to the myth that the dragon and the large serpents were like a swarm in the amphitheater. Other origins suggested for the name include the German word "gräulich", which can mean "grayish" or "horrible". The closest English synonym it has is "gruesome" or "macabre". It has been proposed that the word "graula" may have been the origin of the name. It was commonly used in fourteenth century French as a synonym for raven, especially when used to describe ravens as a bad omen.
Cultural representation.
The legend of St. Clement inspired several other legends of dragonslayer Saints. While Graoully became a symbol of Metz and remains one of the major symbols used by a number of major establishments in the city. Graoully was also used in the local Oscan Games from the twelfth century till the start of the French Revolution. 
Procession of Graoully.
A procession with an effigy of the dragon was held in the city till the nineteenth century. It started in the eleventh century when three banners were carried in the procession of Saint Mark during Rogation days. One of these depicted a dragon's head. During the following century, an effigy of the dragon was constructed and paraded along with the banner. Later on a huge Graoully effigy was used instead of the banners. The French Renaissance writer François Rabelais described the Graoully's effigy during a procession of the sixteenth century: The construction of the effigy continued to evolve and in the 18th century, it was constructed as a canvas figure filled with hay and twelve feet high. The jaws did not move, and the forked tongue ended with points of iron. Every baker in front of whom the procession passed, picked up a half-pound white bun and gave it to the bearer of the dragon. 
Symbolic representation.
A number of writers have stated that the legend of the Graoully is a symbol of Christianity's victory over paganism, with Saint Clement representing religion and paganism represented by the harmful dragon. The oldest known sculpture to date is located at 10 rue Chêvremont, on the maison du serpent. There is also a representation of Graoully on a house in the rue de la Marne in Sarrebourg and in a room in the Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg. A depiction of Graoully from the 16th century is in the crypt in the cathedral of the Saint-Etienne. Another sculpture is suspended in mid-air on Taison street, near the cathedral. The name of the Rue Taison is traced back to a warning from the Graoully: "Taisons, taisons nous, voilà le Graoully qui passe" ( Be silent leave the Graoully alone ). Supposedly Saint Clement had uttered spoken the words "taisons-nous" on his entry into the city. The Groully is also featured on the coats of arms of FC Metz.

Devanthakudu (1960 film)

Devanthakudu () is a 1960 Indian Telugu-language fantasy comedy film produced and directed by C. Pullaiah. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao and Krishna Kumari, with K. V. S. Sarma, S. V. Ranga Rao, Kanta Rao, Kalyanam Raghuramaiah, Peketi Sivaram, P. Hemalatha and Mohana in supporting roles. It is a remake of the 1958 Bengali film "Jamalaye Jibanta Manush" and was simultaneously filmed in Tamil as "Naan Kanda Sorgam" with a largely different cast. "Devanthakudu" was released on 7 July 1960 and became a commercial success.
Plot.
Sundaram is a stage actor. He falls in love with Meenakshi, the daughter of a miserly rich man Bhadraiah who dislikes Sundaram. Bhadraiah fixes his daughter's marriage with an aged billionaire over his wife's protests. Meenakshi and Sundaram marry in secret with the help of his friends. Bhadraiah enters with his goons and drags his daughter home while his goons brutally assault Sundaram. Meenakshi jumps into a river to commit suicide. Crestfallen, Sundaram repents that he was responsible for her death.
While Sundaram sleeps on a veranda, Yama's men, unable to find the address of a dead man, take Sundaram instead with them to hell, the abode of Yama. Sundaram finds his bull there and by unleashing it on Yama, he occupies his throne, promotes Vichitragupta, rewrites Yamaloka's constitution and also takes the opportunity to search for Meenakshi with the help of Narada, who takes him to Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu and Lakshmi, and to Indraloka, the heaven where he finds Meenakshi. With Vishnu and Lakshmi's blessings, Meenakshi is brought to life and to Sundar and the two return to Earth. Bhadraiah relents and accepts Sundar as his son-in-law.
Production.
Development.
After the success of the Telugu film "Pakka Inti Ammayi" (1953), which was based on the Bengali film "Pasher Bari" (1952), its director C. Pullaiah waited for five years to adapt another comical Bengali story for Telugu-speaking audiences. The Bengali fantasy comedy "Jamalaye Jibanta Manush" (1958) was running successfully in cinemas in Bengal. Its screenplay, written by Gouri Shree, incorporated satirical attacks on contemporary life and social issues. Pullaiah established the production company Bhargavi Films with Ch. Subbarao, a Madras-based building contractor, as managing director and himself as producer, and bought the rights to remake "Jamalaye Jibanta Manush" in Telugu and Tamil languages. The Telugu version was titled "Devanthakudu" and the Tamil version was titled "Naan Kanda Sorgam". Adurthi Narasimha Murthy was the screenwriter of "Devanthakudu", and the dialogues were written by Vempati Sadasivabrahmam. Cinematography was handled by A. Shanmugam and the editing by T. R. Srinivasulu while A. Krishnarao served as art director.
Casting and filming.
N. T. Rama Rao was cast as the male lead Sundaram, and Krishna Kumari. S. V. Ranga Rao, who earlier played Yama in "Sati Savitri" (1957), reprised his role in "Devanthakudu". Kalyanam Raghuramaiah played Narada in addition to working as playback singer. The Tamil version featured a largely different cast, with only Ranga Rao mutual to both. "Devanthakudu" and "Naan Kanda Sorgam" were filmed simultaneously, with scenes from the former being filmed first and those from the latter second. Because of a belief that if Rama Rao wore multiple different get-ups the film would succeed, he sported two additional disguises for this film: that of a woman, and that of an elderly dance teacher. After Pullaiah finished filming Raghuramaiah's scene as Narada, it was time to film the same scene in Tamil with P. V. Narasimha Bharathi as the character. Pullaiah noticed one of the assistant directors asking Raghuramaiah to give his garland to Narasimha Bharathi since the scene required Narada to wear one. Pullaiah realised that the production team bought only a single garland instead of two as required, so production resumed only after a new garland was obtained. The final cut of "Devanthakudu" was 17 reels, longer than the Bengali original which was 13 reels.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by Ashwatthama, and the lyrics were written by Aarudhra. The songs "Go Go Gogunra" and "Entha Madhura" attained popularity, as did the various shlokas and poems narrated by Ghantasala and Raghuramaiah.
Release and reception.
"Devanthakudu" was released on 7 July 1960. The film was commercially successful, and became a trendsetter for "socio-fantasy films" in Telugu cinema.

After re-uniting, Anand Babau's wife transforms and prefers to lead a nuclear family away from her in-laws for which Anand Babu agrees as well.

John Attygalle

John Wilhelmus Lucius Attygalle (1906–1981) was the 16th Inspector General of the Sri Lanka Police (IGP) (1966–1967). 
Police career.
Attygalle joined the police force on 1 October 1928 as a Sub-Inspector of Police. In October 1947 he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) as ASP Crimes, Colombo (South) and thereafter was appointed ASP, CID in November 1948; ASP, Ambalangoda January 1950; June 1951 ASP, Colombo Crimes; April 1953 ASP, Western Province (North) and in January 1951 ASP, Jaffna. 
In January 1962 Attygalle, who was then the Superintendent of Police of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), played a major role in stopping the attempted military coup. Attygalle together with Felix Dias Bandaranaike and S. A. Dissanayake (Deputy Inspector General of the CID) informed Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at her residence about the attempt to take over the Government by a coup by certain army, navy and police personnel, on the eve of the coup, which resulted in its failure to occur and the arrest of the coup organisers. In 1963 following the appointment of Dissanayake as Inspector-General of Police he took on the role of Deputy Inspector General of the CID.
In early 1966 Dissanayake was placed on compulsory leave, he was then replaced by Attygalle as Inspector-General in June that year. In July 1966 he arrested Major General Richard Udugama, the Commander of the Ceylon Army, at the Bandaranaike International Airport for his purported involvement in an alleged coup d'état attempt. Udugama was subsequently found not guilty by the Supreme Court and acquitted of all charges. On 1 October 1966 Attygalle established the Police Public Relations Division at Police Headquarters, Colombo. On 1 April 1967, Attygalle arranged for the Police Training School to be shifted from Kalutara to Echen Square Barracks, which were occupied by the Sinha Regiment of the Ceylon Army. The Police Training School was subsequently relocated back to its original premises in Kalutara in December 1970.
On 8 July 1967 he retired from his position as Inspector-General of Police.
Later work.
In 1969 Attygalle, who had been appointed as a special security advisor to the Ministry of External Affairs and Defence in July 1967, prepared a report on the potential threat of the communist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which was presented to the Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake, for consideration. It is felt that the government's subsequent in actions against the JVP precipitated the JVP insurrection in 1971.
Attygalle died on 23 March 1981 at the age of 75.

Katerra

Katerra was an American technology-driven off-site construction company. It was founded in 2015 by Michael Marks, former CEO of Flextronics and former Tesla interim CEO, along with Fritz Wolff, the executive chairman of The Wolff Co. Katerra was listed on LinkedIn's "Top Startup Companies" to work for in 2017.
In May 2020, it was announced that as a part of an additional $200 million raise, COO and former Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard will take over from Michael Marks as CEO of Katerra in June. In June 2021, Katerra announced plans to shut down, laying off remaining employees without paying out earned personal time off or severance.
Operations.
The company was founded in 2015. In January 2018, Katerra took an $835 million investment from Softbank. The investment was made from the Vision Fund.
The company manufactures large building components off-site, particularly for multi-family housing. For example, the company may fabricate an entire wall (including windows) off-site for final assembly on site at a construction project. The technique allows lower cost and the company claims higher-quality finishes.
Katerra is known for its use of mass timber construction and its manufacture of mass timber products such as glued laminated timber and cross-laminated timber. In support of this specialty, Katerra purchased MGA in 2018, the leading architectural firm in the field of tall wood buildings and mass timber construction. In many of its projects, the company serves as an off-site manufacturer, architect, and on-site contractor. It generally contracts directly with owners.
The company has projects ongoing in several states; as of the end of 2018 it has 700 projects underway and many in backlog. It plans to build up to 14 distribution centers across the country.
In December 2019, Katerra reported the company plans to layoff approximately 200 of the workforce and close their factory in Phoenix, Arizona. The manufacturing will be moved to Tracy, California where the costs are lower and highly automated.
In June 2021 Katerra filed for bankruptcy blaming the Covid-19 pandemic and an inability to raise new capital following the collapse of its lender, Greensill Capital, though Greensill wasn't explicitly named in Katerra's statement. Softbank's Vision Fund had reportedly invested more than $2 billion in Katerra in total, including a bailout in December of 2020.

Gaius Laecanius Bassus

Gaius Laecanius Bassus was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was consul "ordinarius" for the year 64 AD with Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi as his colleague. 
Originally from Pola in Istria, where his family owned important pottery works, Bassus was the son of Gaius Laecanus Bassus, suffect consul in 40. Based on the name of Gaius Laecanius Bassus Caecina Paetus, experts surmise that Laecanius Bassus adopted Paetus, consul suffect in 70, who was the biological son of Aulus Caecina Paetus, suffect consul in 37. This was likely a testamentary adoption, where Paetus added Bassus' name to his own in return for a bequest, for there is evidence that the younger man frequently used the name he received at birth. The name of a second man, Gaius Lecanius Bassus Paccius Paelignus, governor of Creta et Cyrenaica, has led some authorities to suggest he may have also been adopted by Laecanius Bassus.

<doc id="56888943" url="?curid=56888943" title="Freiheit (song)">
Freiheit (song)

"Freiheit", also known as "Spaniens Himmel" or "Die Thälmann-Kolonne", is a song written in 1936 by Gudrun Kabisch and Paul Dessau, German anti-fascists. The song was written for the International Brigades but later became a popular standard in Germany and in American communist and folk music communities. The title translates as "Freedom" in English.
Background.
The song was written as an anthem for the German volunteers who made up the Thälmann Battalion of the International Brigades and was originally named "The Thaelman Column" ("Die Thälmann-Kolonne" or "Spaniens Himmel" (Spanish Skies) in German). Composer Dessau and lyricist Kabisch, husband and wife, composed the song while living in exile in Paris and used the pseudonyms Peter Daniels and Paul Ernst, names that still appear on printed versions of the lyrics.
Musically a march, the lyrics of the song make reference to the struggle of the anti-Franco fighters and to a more general struggle for the idea of "freedom". The fight in Spain is put in the context of the universal struggle against fascism, with the chorus making direct reference to the situation in Germany during the period of Nazism. The chorus can be paraphrased as "Home is faraway, but we are ready/We fight and win for you: freedom!"
Lyrics.
&lt;poem&gt;
"Spaniens Himmel breitet seine Sterne"
"Über unsre Schützengraben aus;"
"Und der Morgen grüßt schon aus der Ferne,"
"Bald geht es zum neuen Kampf hinaus."
Chorus
"Die Heimat ist weit,"
"Doch wir sind bereit,"
"Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich:"
"Freiheit!"
"Dem Faschisten werden wir nicht weichen,"
"Schickt er auch die Kugeln hageldicht."
"Mit uns stehen Kameraden ohne gleichen"
"Und ein Rückwärts gibt es für uns nicht."
Chorus
"Die Heimat ist weit,"
"Doch wir sind bereit,"
"Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich:"
"Freiheit!"
"Rührt die Trommel. Fällt die Bajonette."
"Vorwärts marsch. Der Sieg ist unser Lohn."
"Mit der roten Fahne brecht die Kette."
"Auf zum Kampf das Thälmann Bataillon."
Chorus
"Die Heimat ist weit,"
"Doch wir sind bereit,"
"Wir kämpfen und siegen für dich:"
"Freiheit!"
The final chorus in the Ernst Busch version alternatively gives the line "Wir kämpfen und sterben für dich: Freiheit!" in contrast to "kämpfen und siegen" given in the rest of the song. It also features a closing verse in Spanish:
"Mi tierra dejé"
"A España juré"
"que ella siempre será"
"¡Libre!"
&lt;/poem&gt;
Versions.
The song was popularized among German fighters in Spain by singer and International Brigades member Ernst Busch and later became something of an unofficial anthem of the GDR. Busch's recording of the song was later popularized in North America after it was released as a track on the three-record set, "Six Songs for Democracy" by Keynote Records starting in 1938. It was later recorded by Pete Seeger and became part of Seeger's live repertoire.
The song was sung as a dirge by the dissident musician Wolf Biermann as a parodic critique of "the stagnation of the socialist ideal" in the GDR of the 1960s and 1970s.

Towers of Time is an out-of-print collectible card game by Thunder Castle Games and was released in April 1995. The base set had 150 cards with 56-card starter decks and 8-card booster packs. The game was chastised for having starter decks that contained no rules, and instead players would have to call a non-toll-free number to obtain the rules. The rules were eventually printed in Scrye magazine issue #3. An "icon explanation" card, however, was included in the starter decks, but did not explain all the icons found on the cards. Thunder Castle Games announced at least four expansions for the game but none of them ever materialized: "Greek", "Zodiac", "Amazon", and "Norse".
Gameplay depicted the two players as wizards battling between dimensions. Players won by destroying his opponent's Five Shields with creatures, with each shield capable of taking 4 points of damage. There were 6 schools of color: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, White, and Black.

Coming Home (Keith Urban song)

"Coming Home" is a song recorded by New Zealand-born Australian country music artist Keith Urban featuring American singer Julia Michaels, released in March 2018 as the second single from Urban's 2018 album "Graffiti U". The artists co-wrote the song with Nicolle Galyon and J.R. Rotem, with Merle Haggard receiving songwriting credits for the sampling of his 1968 single "Mama Tried". Urban and Rotem are also the producers.
Background and composition.
Urban told "Billboard" he enlisted Michaels "to help [him] flesh out a few little bits and pieces, and then she had this cool bridge idea and she sang that, so she ended up on the song. It's a very specific piece, drawing from very different places from Merle to Julia to J.R. to what [he does], all coming together."
The song contains a sample of "Mama Tried" by Merle Haggard. Urban sought approval from Haggard's widow, Theresa, and his son, Ben, for the use of the guitar riff.
Critical reception.
Billy Dukes from Taste of Country said it's a "song aimed at the next generation of country music fans."
Commercial performance.
As of August 2018, "Coming Home" has sold 113,000 copies in the United States.
Music video.
The music video was directed by Andy Hines and premiered on CMT, GAC and Vevo in April 2018. It was filmed in Los Angeles for over two days, with the main performance with Michaels being at the city's Cowboy Palace Saloon.

<doc id="56889153" url="?curid=56889153" title="National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003">
National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003

National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 () was a proposed bill which aimed to amend the Crimes Ordinance, the Official Secrets Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance pursuant to the obligation imposed by Article 23 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and to provide for related, incidental and consequential amendments. The proposed bill caused considerable controversy in Hong Kong and a massive demonstration on 1 July 2003. In the aftermath, James Tien resigned from the Executive Council and the bill was withdrawn after it became clear that it would not get the necessary support from the Legislative Council for it to be passed. The bill was then shelved indefinitely.
Background.
The Article 23 of the Basic Law (BL 23) states:
Before 1997, the government of British Hong Kong introduced the Crimes (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 1996 in an attempt to concretize the concepts of "subversion" and secession" by confining them to actual violent conduct but it failed as it was strongly opposed by the PRC government. The failure of this 1996 bill thus left a vacuum in the present legislation.
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) had delayed the matter and had successfully warded off any suggestion to enact a law. However the controversy over Article 23 began in mid-2002 when Qian Qichen, Vice Premier of the State Council, expressed the PRC government's desire for Hong Kong to pass the required legislation quickly. This prompted the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa to begin the process of drafting the said legislation. On 24 September 2002, the HKSAR government unveiled its "Consultation Document on Proposals to Implement Article 23 of the Basic Law". Even before the publication of the consultation document, many groups such as the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Hong Kong Journalists Association had expressed grave concerns in July 2002 about the possible implementation of the Article 23. The three-month consultation ended in December after a demonstration on 15 December 2002 which drew almost 60,000 people against the proposal. In response, the government amended the proposal by giving several major "concessions" on the substance, but rejected the call for a white paper.
Content.
The National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill was introduced to the Legislative Council on 26 February 2003 after a blue bill was published in the Gazette on 14 February. The bill was to provide for the following:
50 out of the total 60 Legislative Council members joined the Bills Committee. Chaired by Ip Kwok-him of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) and his deputy Ambrose Lau of the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA), the committee oversaw the fierce battle between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy members. During the Bills Committee's deliberations on the bill, the government agreed to some amendments, but the critics said they were insufficient and the government's timetable of passing the bill in the Legislative Council did not allow sufficient time for deliberation. 
Positions.
Concern with the legislation arose because of the authoritarian nature of the PRC government: the bill would invoke concepts of treason against the PRC government in certain circumstances. Critics claimed that the legislation would erode freedom of speech. Suspicions were exacerbated by the refusal of the HKSAR government to issue a white paper on the legislation, causing groups such as Amnesty International to declare that it had "grave concerns about the proposals in the government's consultation document and the lack of a draft white paper which means that the public still do not know how the legislation will actually be worded." The government would be required to issue a blue paper containing the draft legislation when it presented the new bill to the Legislative Council, but this would leave no time for the public to voice its concerns, and the government might use its unelected majority in Legco to rush the bill through.
Concerns.
In the consultation document of Article 23 enactment, the following issues caused concern:
Debate.
Supporters of the legislation, the most vocal of which is perhaps Hong Kong's Secretary for Security Regina Ip, viewed the introduction of the law as being quite ordinary and natural:
Ip has been criticised by the press and religious groups for her zealousness in pursuing the implementation of the legislation. Ip asserted that because the ordinary people would not "understand the legal language", there was no point in consulting them on it.
Bob Allcock, the Solicitor General of Hong Kong, was perceived as more even-handed in his approach and frequently argued that the laws proposed by the government are less restrictive than the colonial era laws that they were intended to replace:
Alcock also pointed out that under the new laws, a banned organization can appeal the ban to the judiciary, a right not available under the previous laws.
In response, opponents of the bill including Martin Lee have argued that a potentially repressive bill is more acceptable in a system of parliamentary democracy and that under British rule, the potential impact of security laws was minimised by the fact that political leaders would suffer political damage if they attempted to enforce these laws. The argument is that in the case where Hong Kong becomes authoritarian, there are fewer restrictions which prevent them drafting bad laws.
In response to the argument that Article 23 legislation is constitutionally required, opponents to the government bill point out that the Basic Law does not set up a specific time for passage of the legislation, and that the Basic Law also constitutionally requires that the HK government work toward a system of universal suffrage. Opponents argue that because both goals do not have time limits, there is no reason to implement Article 23 legislation before universal suffrage.
Another argument against Article 23 laws as drafted by the HKSAR government has been given by John Kamm, who argued that the mechanism for banning organizations would have the effect of requiring that the PRC government be more repressive outside of Hong Kong. His argument is that since 1997, the PRC government has not had the legal concept of banning an organization on national security grounds, and that political repression in the PRC takes the form of government criminal charges against individual acts. He argued that the HK government's draft of Article 23 law requires the PRC to set up a system of banning organizations on national security grounds and this would greatly hurt members of politically sensitive organizations who are not leaders. He pointed out that the PRC currently typically imprisons only the leadership of an organization, and "merely" harass lower-level members because their behavior does not rise to the level of criminal charges. By passing Article 23 law, Hong Kong will require the PRC government to develop the legal mechanisms to punish all members of a banned political organization, a power it now only had with respect to religious organizations such as Falun gong and students who were involved in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. For example, Macau, which has implemented the national security legislation, identical to the article proposed for Hong Kong, in June 2009 refused transit to mainland China by a Tiananmen student leader Wu'er Kaixi.
Finally, at a time when Hong Kong's economy-inextricably linked to its property index-was in the doldrums, and SARS had had a major impact on life in the HKSAR region, the government's focus on Article 23 had been perceived as inappropriate, especially since Hong Kong has been a stable place since the 1997 handover from the United Kingdom to the PRC, and that therefore revision of colonial anti-subversion laws was not required.
Journalists in particular are concerned about the new law, especially with respect to journalistic criticism of the PRC government and its complex relationship with Taiwan and Tibet, or other matters arising from the possession of official documents.
Outspoken Roman Catholic Bishop Joseph Cardinal Zen has been a key figure in the debate over the legislation: on 15 May 2003 he instructed his church members to resist the introduction of the legislation. But his speech was criticized by some pro-PRC political commentators in Hong Kong, saying that the Church should not be involved in political matters.
The normally neutral Hong Kong Bar Association also stepped into the fray: Bar Association chairman Alan Leong has publicly said: "The more you read into this document, the more anxious and concerned you get. There are some glaring ambiguities".
Other organisations which have spoken out against the proposal include the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Foreign Correspondents' Club and the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong. Members of the European Parliament, and officials of the United States Department of State, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have expressed concerns about the Article 23 legislation.
Some banks in Hong Kong were reported to be considering relocation if the proposed Article 23 was passed, out of the fear that the laws would restrict the free flow of information. On 7 December 2002, it was reported in the press that ten foreign banks had told the government privately that the introduction of Article 23 would have disastrous consequences for Hong Kong, threatening its demise as Asia's financial capital.
July 1 demonstration and downfall.
After the SARS outbreak in early 2003 drew some attention away from the bill, the pro-democracy camp mobilised the public to oppose the bill after Hong Kong began to recover from the SARS crisis in June. On 1 July 2003, the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR, more than a half million Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest the proceedings regarding the bill, as well as to air other grievances against the administration of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
After the huge turnout on 1 July, the pro-democrats called for protesters to rally around the Legislative Council building on 9 July if the proceedings on the bill were to continue on that day. In the evening of 6 July, Liberal Party chairman James Tien decided to withdraw from the "governing coalition" by resigning from the Executive Council in protest against Tung's decision to adhere to the 9 July deadline. Knowing that the bill would not be passed without the Liberal Party, the SAR government finally decided to postpone the bill. On 17 July 2003, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa announced that the government would reopen public consultation on the bill to ensure its content would receive broad public support before it is passed into law.

List of Turkish ships sunk or damaged during World War II

Turkey was neutral during World War II. But Turkish cargo ships were frequently sunk or damaged by the warring nations. In the following list those ships which were sunk or damaged during the war by the warring nations are shown.
Except for Adana, Duatepe and Antares all of these ships were sunk. Usually the crew were taken prisoner. But the human casualty was heavy in Refah and Mefkure cases. In Refah, 168 people on way for training and in Mefkure 301 Jewish refugees were lost.

Associated Producers

Associated Producers was an American film production and distribution company of the silent era. Inspired by the foundation of United Artists, the company brought together a group of leading film directors who hoped running their own company would given them greater financial and artistic control over their work. Those involved with the outfit included Allan Dwan, Marshall Neilan, Maurice Tourneur, Thomas H. Ince, Mack Sennett and George Loane Tucker Established in late 1919, the company chose not to release their films through United Artists as widely expected but to handle their own distribution. It was also announced that any other directors wishing to join the company would be welcomed. Future director Howard Hawks became involved raising finances for several pictures for the company.
The company announced plans to have at least thirty releases in its first year. Before long, however, this proved to be too ambitious a target. Many of the directors were still under contract to produce films for other studios before they could start work for Associated Producers. One of the most financially successful of the company's releases was Maurice Tourneur's "The Last of the Mohicans". Otherwise the company was struggling financially, and according to "Variety" was losing $5,000 a day by summer 1921.
Eventually the company abandoned its idea of independent releasing, and signed a deal for its films to be handled by First National Pictures. Soon afterwards production was stopped completely.

Grand Steeple-Chase des Flandres

The (; "great steeplechase of Flanders") is a horserace held annually at the Hippodrome Waregem in Waregem, Belgium. It is the centrepiece of the ("Waregem Races") meeting, held on the Tuesday of the , a kermesse which begins on the weekend of the last Sunday in August. Local businesses often close for the kermesse. The race is sometimes described as the Belgian Grand National, by analogy with the (English) Grand National. It has a distance of 4600m, with 25 obstacles, the most spectacular of which is the water jump across the Gaverbeek river, which is in front of the grandstand and taken twice in the race. In 1990 the water jumpwas redesigned to reduce the frequency of horses breaking legs; it faced continued criticism from animal welfare activists after deaths there in 2012. The "Waregem Koerse" was first held in 1849 on the city's cobbled streets; the "Steeple-Chase" was first held in 1858, sponsored by French businessman Marc Lejeune. In its early decades it was one of the most prestigious horseraces in Europe. It declined after the Second World War when French prize money grew, but recovered somewhat from the 1980s. In the 1990s there was an increase in the number of British entries, from smaller stables. Multiple winners include Spectre (five wins in the 1870s), Redpath (seven wins 1880s–1890s) and Taupin Rochelais (three wins 2015–2017). Since 2010 the race has formed part of the Crystal Cup series of European steeplechases.

Grami's Circus Show () is a South Korean slapstick comedy 3D animated television series produced by Studio Gale. It aired on KBS1 and is available on Netflix.
Synopsis.
Grami, Nemo and Sam, a trio of three lions and a ringmaster Jack train for and perform their circus show.
Reception.
Critical response.
Stuart Heritage of "The Guardian" wrote, "I have to hold my hands up here and admit that I’m slightly obsessed with Grami’s Circus Show. I boggle at the audacity of it. It is so spectacularly inappropriate that watching it is like picking a scab. Watching it with a toddler, as I’ve done by accident, is like playing chicken with object permanence; it’s fun in the moment, but the second any of it sinks in is the moment we’re all screwed."
Accolades.
In 2014, the series won a Pulcinella award in the category of "TV Series for Teen", being the only Asian show to do so in that year. The show was also the in the official selections for the SICAF awards but didn't win.

Philip Keung

Philip Keung Ho-man (; born 26 October 1966) is a Hong Kong actor and film producer. Keung began his acting career as a television actor in 1985 for Asia Television (ATV), and also began appearing in films from 1988. He eventually left ATV in 2010 and became a full-time film actor while occasionally acting in television series from time to time. In 2017, Keung was nominated for the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the 2016 film, "Trivisa", and in the following year, Keung won the award for his performance in the 2017 film, "Shock Wave".
Early life.
Keung is the oldest son in his family, being the elder brother of two younger sisters and a younger brother. His father was already separated from his mother before he was born and thus, he has never met his father. Keung's mother was later remarried to a Chung (鍾) surnamed decorator contractor. Because his mother suffered from illness and his adopted father was busy with work at the same time, his younger siblings were sent to a children's home. When Keung was 14 years old, his mother died from her illness and he was sent to the Holland Hostel operated by the Hong Kong Student Aid Society in Kwun Tong. Keung had previously attended many primary schools, ranging from North Point to Kwun Tong. Later, he was enrolled in the Delia Memorial School (Yuet Wah).
Career.
While attending secondary school, Keung starting working in a number of odd jobs such as a dim sum waiter at the China Restaurant, a decorator and an acrobat performer. He later became an extra actor since his girlfriend at that time worked in an extra actors' agency. In 1986, Keung signed up for Asia Television's (ATV) first "Mr. Television Competition" (電視先生選舉), where he won second place as well as the title of "Mr. Talent" (才華先生) and subsequently became a contracted artiste for ATV.
Keung received praises for his satirical portrayal of LegCo member Leung Kwok-hung in ATV's political parody program, "Hong Kong Gossip". However, since the audience viewership for ATV has been low, most local audiences only began noticing him after he left ATV in 2010 and began appearing in high-profile films such as "Beast Stalker" (2008), "The Stool Pigeon" (2010) and "Life Without Principle" (2011), for which he was nominated for the Chinese Film Media Awards for Best Supporting Actor.
In recent years, Keung has become one of Hong Kong's most prolific film actors, appearing in over 40 films between 2013 and 2018, playing major supporting roles in many high-profile films such as "Firestorm", "Unbeatable", "Little Big Master", "Two Thumbs Up" and "Trivisa", for which he was nominated for the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor and Hong Kong Film Critics Society Award for Best Actor.
In 2017, Keung won the Best Supporting Actor Award at the 1st Profima International Film Fest &amp; Awards in Malaysia for his performance in the action film "Shock Wave", winning his first acting award in his career. At the 37th Hong Kong Film Awards, Keung was once again awarded Best Supporting Actor for his role in "Shock Wave", while being nominated in the same category for his performance in the film, "Concerto of the Bully".
Keung landed the leading role in two films, "Tracey" and "Remember What I Forgot", which were promoted at the 2018 Hong Kong International Film &amp; TV Market (FILMART), which ran from 19 to 22 March 2018. In the former, Keung played a 51-year-old married man and father whose craving for feminization increases, while he played a Hong Kong film fanatic who suffers from brain degeneration in the latter.
In 2019, Keung starred in the TVB drama "The Defected" as “Bingo”, for which he made into the top five nominations for Best Actor at the 2019 TVB Anniversary Awards. In 2021, he starred in the TVB drama "Murder Diary" as a Superintendent of Police who suffered from Bipolar Disorder after his wife’s disappearance. Being invited by Hana Kuk, Keung filmed his first MV for “Trust Nobody”, the ending theme of "Murder Diary".
Personal life.
In 1999, Keung married former ATV actress, Anna Kam (殷寧).
His wife is known as Kappy King. She competed in the Miss ATV Pageant and was voted as Miss Congeniality.

Malabon People's Park

The Malabon People's Park, also known as Catmon People's Park, is an urban park situated in the densely populated village of Catmon, in the northern Metro Manila city of Malabon, the Philippines. The park occupies the central plaza of the Justice Compound, home of the Malabon Prosecutor's Office and formerly the Malabon-Navotas Regional Trial Court until 2010. It is located just off Sanciangco Street near its intersection with Governor Pascual Avenue in a flood-prone part of the city close to the south bank of the Tullahan River.
The plan for the Catmon park was announced in 2011 when the Malabon city government allotted for the installation of playground equipments at the Justice Compound as part of its 2012 budget. It was inaugurated by Mayor Antolin Oreta on December 16, 2012, and was subsequently named the "People's Park."

It also has a badminton and tennis court, comfort rooms, stone benches and accessibility features for persons with disability. The Malabon City Main Library, one of only two public libraries in the city, is situated just across the street from the park. It was built in 1995 to replace the old facility near the Malabon City Hall in San Agustin. In 2011, the New Malabon City Jail was built by the national government through its Bureau of Jail Management and Penology at the site of the former regional trial court which moved to higher ground in Goldenvale Subdvision, Tinajeros in 2010 after the destruction caused by Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy).
In January 2014, the construction of a basketball half court at the park was announced and was given a budget of under the Malabon General Fund CY 2014.

The Saturn Myth

The Saturn Myth: A Reinterpretation of Rites and Symbols Illuminating Some of the Dark Corners of Primordial Society is a 1980 non-fiction book written by David N Talbott which speculates that early humanity witnessed a much different celestial alignment. According to the book, Earth was a former satellite of Saturn before a hypothesized cataclysm, which caused the earth, Saturn, Mars, and Venus to lose their previous orbits.
Synopsis.
The book examines similar tales in comparative mythology and states that thousands of years ago, Earth was a former satellite of Saturn, and that a vastly different solar system alignment existed. This proto-Saturn, devoid of its current rings, was much closer to the sun. 
According to the author, a major cataclysm disfigured the previous planetary configuration and unleashed major chaos on a formerly advanced human civilization.
This astronomical catastrophe ended a previous Golden Age in which humans, previously living in an advanced civilization, witnessed drastic changes in their sky. 
Survivors of this cataclysm later retold this story to their descendants in the form of religious archetypes, which represents planetary bodies.
The book's concept is widely promoted on a YouTube channel called The Thunderbolts Project and is organized by the theory's advocates. The basis for the book's claims rely on recurring tales in mythology regarding ancient archetypes and formulates a cosmological answer for the many similarities between these myths. The writer of the book promotes a fringe version of the cosmological model called the Plasma Universe Theory.
Many contemporary scientists regard the book as a form of pseudohistory. Much of the inspiration for the book comes from ideas postulated by psychoanalyst Immanuel Velikovsky.

Outdoor Voices

Outdoor Voices sometimes just O.V. is an American clothing company, focused on the design and sale of athletic apparel. The company was founded in 2013 by Tyler Haney in New York City, and is now headquartered in Austin. The company's products are sold online and at its stores. On February 25, 2020 Haney tendered her resignation, and Cliff Moskowitz, the president of a fashion-oriented private equity firm, took over as interim CEO.
History.
The company's founder, Tyler Haney, was motivated to found Outdoor Voices due to a love of sports and athletics. She founded Outdoor Voices in 2013. In early 2014, J. Crew selected the Outdoor Voices line for its stores’ "Brands We Love" sections after the line was featured in a London boutique, Garbstore. The company's first store opened in Austin in October 2014. Its first pop-up shop opened in Manhattan in 2015. The company was known initially for their "kits," which included a collection of tops and bottoms that could be mixed and matched for a bundled price. 
Over time, Outdoor Voices raised over $9.5 million from investors like General Catalyst Partners. 
In 2015, Outdoor Voices received $7.5 million in investments to start their active apparel line. 
In 2016, Haney decided to move to Austin, Texas to focus on building a new and a bigger headquarters for the company and hired more employees including some of Haney's friends from high school.
Mickey Drexler, the former CEO of Gap Inc. and J. Crew Group, Inc., became the company's chairman of the board in the summer of 2017.
As of March 2018, the company had raised roughly $57 million in funding. Lead investors include GV, General Catalyst Partners, and Forerunner Ventures.
On April 24, 2018, Outdoor Voices launched a running collection with Hoka One One. They also released a corresponding app called O.V. Trail Shop. The app features the nearest Trail Shops where the new running collection can be found. 
In 2018, Outdoor Voices launched their first swimwear collection called “H2Ov”.
In February 2020, in an effort to restructure the company, Haney stepped down as CEO. Outdoor Voices indicated that there will be an additional 15 layoffs across the company.
Outdoor Voices has collaborated with other clothing and exercise-related companies to produce limited run products. Collaborators include the fashion blog "Man Repeller", ClassPass, French fashion label A.P.C., and Teva.

Critical reception.
In a rave review, Jenna Mohammed, writing for "Exclaim!" called McLaughlin's voice "immensely powerful". Mohammed described the album as "high-energy from start to finish", and that her "style and essence is very reminiscent of Florence + the Machine and Banks, but she sets herself apart through intense beat drops and her gospel choir roots". In a more mixed review, Sal Cinquemani, writing for "Slant Magazine" described the album as "largely joyless", saying that "across 10 tracks, though, Briggs's formula ultimately reveals itself to be one-note."

Yo-kai Watch Shadowside

 is a supernatural anime series produced by OLM. It is the sequel to the 2017 film "" and a proper sequel to the original "Yo-kai Watch" anime series, originally based on the games created by Level-5. Yōichi Katō returned to officially direct and write the anime alongside new staff. It premiered in all TXN Stations in Japan from April 13, 2018 to March 29, 2019. It was replaced by the 2019 "Yo-kai Watch!" series in the same timeslot.
Just like the movie before it, the series takes a darker and more mature approach to the franchise, with a much higher focus on the story driven drama and conflict, as opposed to the original series which followed a comedic, segmented approach.
Plot.
Taking place after the events of the fourth film, the series centers on Tate Adams, Summer's brother who doesn't believe in supernatural phenomena. But as he notices his sister is frequently comes back home late, he decided to stalk her, only to find out she is exorcising evil Yo-kai and running a Yo-kai detective agency. With their secret revealed to him, Summer decided to let him tag along in her activities as they investigate Yo-kai crimes and take on evil Yo-kai to maintain peace all over the city.
Meanwhile, Shutendoji (the one who had planned all the evil, as seen in an epilogue at the end of the fourth movie), accompanied by his Yo-kai bodyguard Doketsu, is in search of the "princess" that he has hoped to unite with, over the events of the anime. They both search for the "princess" while in their human disguises, and observing the actions of the Yo-kai detective agency.
Production.
Before the reveal of "Shadowside", the original anime saw a decline back in 2017 due to staggeringly low sales of later games in the main series and falling ratings for the first anime. The series was conceived after the production of the film, and was officially revealed in the March 2018 issue of Coro Coro Comic as the film serves as a prequel to the anime and the original anime series following the reported drop of interest to the IP. The anime, like the film that preceded it, follows a much darker route in order to gain interest from older viewers. Alongside the returning characters, two new Yo-kai designs have been revealed. Alongside the new designs, the characters of the film have different voice actors as well. The official promo video was shown in Anime Japan 2018, which details the series's plot.
Media.
Anime.
The anime officially premiered on all TXN stations in Japan, including TV Tokyo and TV Osaka on April 13, 2018, replacing the original "Yo-kai Watch" anime series in its timeslot, with the first and second episode premiering on the same day as a one-hour special. The first opening theme is titled by Hard Birds while the first ending theme is titled by King Cream Soda. The opening and ending themes were changed on October 5, 2018 to by Hard Birds and "Oyasumi Sanka" by King Cream Soda.
Video game.
"Yo-kai Watch 4" was developed and published by Level-5 and it has been released on the Nintendo Switch on 20th June 2019 in Japan.

Virginia Minnich

Virginia Minnich (1910–1996) was an American molecular biologist and hematology researcher known for discovering hemoglobin E, an abnormal form of hemoglobin that can cause blood disorders, and for working out the glutathione synthesis pathway. She was a noted blood morphologist and teacher and helped set up hematology laboratories around the world. She was the first person without a PhD or MD to be appointed a Professor of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis.
Early life and education.
Virginia Minnich was born on January 24, 1910 in Zanesville, Ohio and raised on her family's farm. She suffered severe burns at the age of four when her dress caught fire from a gas stove and she underwent close to thirty operations to correct the resultant disfigurement. Despite the surgeries, she was left with considerable scarring to her face, neck, and upper body that led some colleagues to discourage her from jobs requiring much human interaction.
She had wanted to become a nurse, but was discouraged from this career path, so she decided to study to become a dietician. She received a Bachelor of Science in Home Economics from Ohio State University in 1937 and a master's degree in Nutrition from Iowa State College in 1938. In her senior year, Minnich worked part-time in the hematology laboratory of Carl V. Moore, with whom she would later work with extensively at Washington University. Minnich never received a doctorate degree, a decision which she regretted and which she attributed to dissuasion from Moore. She believed Moore's discouragement held back her salary and career advancement compared to men doing similar work.
Career.
After graduating from Ohio State University in 1938, Minnich wrote to Carl Moore to ask for a job and he offered her a position as a research technician helping start a Hematology department at Washington University. She remained at Washington University for her entire career. She was promoted to a research associate in 1954, research assistant professor in 1958, research associate professor in 1963, and full professor of Medicine in 1974 (the first person without a doctorate degree to reach this rank at Washington University). She became professor emeritus in 1978 and retired in 1984. She also worked at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis from 1975 to the mid-1980s as assistant and then associate director of Hematology.
She was regarded as an excellent teacher and, in addition to her official teaching responsibilities, she gave informal "night courses" to pathologists, lab technicians, and others. She created a series of audiovisual teaching materials describing the morphology of blood and bone marrow that were published by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists in the early 1980s as a 10-part course in morphologic hematology.
International work.
Minnich established a hematology laboratory at the University of Havana in 1945. In 1951, she went to Bangkok, Thailand for a year as part of an exchange program between Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital and Washington University. There, in addition to teaching, she began her research on thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies and she returned for three months in 1954 to continue this work. In 1964, she traveled to Turkey on a Fulbright scholarship and set up a Hematology laboratory in the University of Ankara's pediatrics department (later renamed the Virginia Minnich Hematology Laboratory in her honor).
Research.
Minnich's research encompassed a variety of hematology and nutrition topics, many centered around iron metabolism. She published over 45 scientific papers and 19 abstracts including noted work on blood disorders (in particular thrombocytopenic purpura, thalassemia, and hemoglobinopathies); the relationship between pica and iron deficiency; and synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione.
 Early Work 
Minnich participated in early research into iron metabolism, including studies of fluctuation in women's iron levels throughout their menstrual cycle and investigations into how iron is best absorbed. Through this work she helped develop more accurate methods for analyzing the data they collected and, throughout her career she continued to ensure that best practices were being followed in Washington University's Hematology department. From 1949 to 1951 she worked with William Harrington in a landmark study involving self-experimentation that showed that low blood platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura were caused by an immune response leading to platelet destruction.
 Hemoglobin E 
While in Thailand in 1951, Minnich found an unusually high rate of thalassemias, blood disorders characterized by decreased levels of the oxygen-carrying molecule hemoglobin. Upon further examination, she discovered that this was an undescribed form of thalassemia involving a novel abnormal hemoglobin molecule, hemoglobin E caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene (HBB). People who inherit one copy of the HbE gene and one copy of the normal β-globin gene (HbA) are said to "carry the HbE trait", and are asymptomatic, as are most people who inherit two copies of HbE. However, inheritance of one HbE copy and one copy of HBB with a different mutation, such as one that causes β-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, leads to a thalassemia ranging from mild to severe depending on the nature of the second mutation. Minnich was the first person to describe hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, in 1951. Her work led to further research into this disease, which is estimated to affect a million people worldwide. HbE is considered to be one of the most common genetic mutations, with carrier rates approaching 60% in some parts of Southeast Asia, and testing for HbE is now part of routine neonatal screening and genetic counseling.
 Pica 
In 1965, while in Turkey setting up a hematology laboratory at the University of Ankara, Minnich noticed a form of pica involving clay eating. When she followed up this research upon her return to Washington University, she found a similar clay eating practice in parts of the United States. Pica had been known to be associated with iron deficiency but the cause/effect relationship was unclear; Minnich found that that clay actually made iron deficiency worse by acting as a chelating agent, binding iron in the bloodstream and removing it from the body.
 Glutathione synthesis 
In 1970, a former colleague, Dan Mohler, referred her to a family with a glutathione synthetase deficiency, leading her to develop and perform biochemical assays to elucidate the glutathione synthesis pathway.
Later life.
Minnich retired from Washington University in 1984. She died of ovarian and colon cancer April 26, 1996 in Pensacola, Florida. She willed her estate to the Washington University School of Medicine to be used for student scholarships, and Washington University established a visiting professorship in clinical hematology in her name.

Samar Island Natural Park

The Samar Island Natural Park, in Samar, is the largest contiguous tract of old-growth forest in the Philippines. It is the country's largest terrestrial protected area, with an area of . The buffer is spread north to south over the island's three provinces (Eastern Samar, Northern Samar and Samar province) and totals , about a third of the entire island of Samar.
The park includes some of the island's well-known natural landmarks and landscapes which have been earlier designated for protection, namely the former Sohoton Natural Bridge National Park, the former Calbiga Caves Protected Landscape, the former Taft Forest Wildlife Sanctuary, the former Jicontol Watershed Forest Reserve and the former Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve. It has a large biodiversity. It is a center of plant and animal diversity and endemism in the Philippines containing a number of threatened species belonging to the Eastern Visayas and Mindanao biogeographic region.
Geography.
The Samar Island Natural Park occupies the low rugged central mountain range of the island of Samar shared by all three provinces in the island. It extends from the Northern Samar municipalities of Catubig, 
Las Navas, Lope de Vega, Mondragon and Silvino Lobos in the north to the Eastern Samar municipalities of Arteche, Balangiga, Balangkayan, Borongan, Can-avid, Dolores, General MacArthur, Giporlos, Hernani, Jipapad, Lawaan, Llorente, Maslog, Maydolong, Oras, Quinapondan, San Julian, Sulat and Taft; and the Samar Province municipalities of Basey, Calbayog, Calbiga, Catbalogan, Gandara, Hinabangan, Jiabong, Marabut, Matuguinao, Motiong, Paranas, Pinabacdao, San Jorge and 
San Jose de Buan in the island's central and southern regions.
The headwaters of 25 watersheds begin from the slopes in the natural park. The largest is the Suribao watershed with an area of , followed by Can-avid (), Dolores (), Catubig (), Gandara (), and Taft ().
The natural park consists of an interior highland with marked accordant peaks and a surrounding limestone or karst terrain. In the southern portion, the landscape is composed of jungle-covered limestone ridges. Its geology is mostly Miocene and Holocene with a sedimentary formation consisting of basement rocks and overlying clastic rocks or limestone. Its ecosystems include grasslands, agroforestry areas, forest-over-limestone, riparian ecosystem, lowland mixed dipterocarp forest, and mossy or cloud forest.
The park is a known habitat of the Philippine eagle. It also has a significant population of the Philippine eagle-owl, Philippine tarsier, Philippine flying lemur and Philippine tree squirrel. It was declared a forest reserve in 1996 but raised to the status of natural park in 2003.
Sohoton Natural Bridge Park.
The Sohoton Natural Bridge Park is a conservation area and ecotourism site in the municipality of Basey known for its geological features including its natural stone bridge which connects two mountain ridges across a gorge, and an extensive cave system with unique limestone formations. It covers and was earlier established on July 19, 1935, through Proclamation No. 831 issued by Governor-General Frank Murphy.
Calbiga Caves Park.
The Langun-Gobingob cave system is in the natural park. It is considered the biggest cave in the Philippines.
Taft Forest.
In the municipality of Taft, Eastern Samar, of rainforest have been protected as a wildlife sanctuary since 1999. The area is a known nesting site and natural habitat of the critically endangered Philippine eagle. The endemic giant forest raptor was first spotted in the island in the municipality of Paranas on June 15, 1856, by the British explorer John Whitehead.
Jicontol Forest.
The Jicontol Watershed Forest Reserve, first gazetted in 1992 and reclassified as a natural park in 1998, covers in the municipalities of Dolores, Can-avid and Maslog. It is a component of the Mounts Cabalantian-Capotoan Complex, an important bird area, which comprises the mountains of central Samar at the border of Eastern Samar and Samar provinces. This forest is home to many threatened and restricted-range species of the Mindanao and Eastern Visayas Endemic Bird Area, such as the Samar hornbill, Visayan broadbill and yellow-breasted tailorbird. Its forest cover consists of typical dipterocarp and molave-dipterocarp with mid mountain type vegetation in the highest peaks reaching to . There have also been sightings of the Southern silvery kingfisher and the Philippine eagle in the forest.
Bulosao Watershed.
The Bulosao watershed reserve in the forests of the southern Samar mountain range adjacent to the MacArthur mountains was established in 1992 to preserve and maintain the usefulness of the Bulosao River as a source of water for domestic use and irrigation of the municipalities of Marabut and Lawaan. The forest park borders the Sulat River to the north and west, and includes Mount Honop, its highest peak at .

Mr. Keynes and the &quot;Classics&quot;

John Hicks's 1937 paper Mr. Keynes and the "Classics"; a suggested interpretation is the most influential study of the views presented by J. M. Keynes in his "General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" of February 1936. It gives "a potted version of the central argument of the "General Theory"" as an equilibrium specified by two equations (shown as intersecting curves in the "IS-LM" diagram) which dominated Keynesian teaching until Axel Leijonhufvud published a critique in 1968. Leijonhufvud's view that Hicks misrepresented Keynes's theory by reducing it to a static system was in turn rejected by many economists who considered much of the "General Theory" to be as static as Hicks portrayed it.
James Tobin described the "IS-LM" model as:
... the tool of first resort. If you are faced with a problem of interpretation of the economy – policy or events – probably the first thing you can do is to try to see how to look at it in these [IS-LM] terms.
Background.
Publication history.
"Mr Keynes and the "Classics"" was first published in "Econometrica" (April 1937) and reprinted in 'Critical essays in monetary theory' (1967) and again in 'Money, interest and wages' (1982), this time with a prefatory note.
Several of Hicks's other papers deal with the same subject. His review of the "General Theory" was published in the "Economic journal" in June 1936 and reissued in 'Money, interest and wages'. 'The classics again' was published in the same journal in 1957 and reissued in 'Critical essays in monetary theory'. 'IS-LM – an explanation' was published in the winter 1980-1 issue of the "Journal of post-Keynesian economics" and reprinted in 'Money, interest and wages'.
Origins of "Mr Keynes and the "Classics"".
Hicks's paper as first was based on a version read at a meeting of the Econometric Society at Oxford in September 1936, and taking account of the discussion which took place there and later at Cambridge. 
According to Warren Young it should be 'regarded not so much as an original and new piece of analysis but as a synthesis of earlier interpretational attempts by [Roy] Harrod and [James] Meade'. Meade and Harrod 'themselves were intimately associated with the development of the "General Theory"'; Harrod was one of the colleagues to whom Keynes sent proofs of the book for comment. Gonçalo L. Fonseca specifically mentions that "The equations of the "IS-LM" model were written down by Harrod (1937), but the (later) drawing of the diagram by Hicks robbed him of his claims to precedence".
Hicks's own account of the origins of the paper is rather different. He had been working independently on questions overlapping those addressed by the "General Theory" and found much in it which corresponded to his own thinking. It is this convergence of thinking, rather than the prior knowledge supplied by others, which accounts for his rapidly arriving at a clear picture of Keynes's views. This account explains the singlemindedness of Hicks's interpretation, which homes in on Book IV of the "General Theory" and on excessive wages as a cause of unemployment, while other reviewers were struggling to reconcile the different elements of Keynes's thought.
Hicks's relatively classical interpretation of Keynes made him the target of criticisms from more radical Keynesians. He had considered the "General Theory" a more conservative work than Keynes's earlier "Treatise on Money" and given it a favourable review. But he came to have doubts about the formalism he'd presented in 'Mr Keynes and the Classics' and oscillated between retractions and reavowals.
Terminology.
The two curves in Hicks's original diagram are labelled "IS" and "LL", and his original name for the model was "IS-LL" (or possibly even "SI-LL"), but the name which stuck was "IS-LM". It is also known as the 'Hicks-Hansen model', reflecting the importance of Alvin Hansen's 1953 'Guide to Keynes' (which interpreted Keynes's system along the lines of Hicks's model) in introducing Keynesian ideas to America.
Mathematical representation of Keynes's theory.
The "General Theory".
See the article on the "General Theory" for a description of Keynes's economic ideas. Chapters 1–13 and 15 develop the concepts on which Keynes's model is based. The model itself receives an initial statement in Chapter 14 and is 'restated' in Chapter 18: it is these statements which Hicks presented in the mathematical form of an equilibrium specified by simultaneous equations.
The choice of units.
In section I, Hicks presents Keynes's theories in opposition to Pigou's 1933 "Theory of Unemployment". He remarks that:
Professor Pigou's theory runs, to a quite amazing extent, in real terms... The ordinary classical economist has no part in this "tour de force".
But if, on behalf of the ordinary classical economist, we declare that we would have preferred to investigate many of those problems in money terms, Mr. Keynes will reply that there is no classical theory of money wages and unemployment.
This attaches considerable importance to the choice of units, as Keynes himself did when criticising Pigou. The explanation is that the conversion factors – the price level and the wage rate – are not neutral like physical units, but themselves part of the analysis. 
Keynes had avoided real values because their use requires the postulation of a single 'representative' price level. At times in the "General Theory" he allowed every industry to have its own price and elasticity of employment. Hicks split the economy into just two sectors: capital goods and consumption goods. Even this is more than he needed, and in the account below we treat the economy as a single sector.
Hicks assumes that the wage rate is fixed externally ('exogenous').
The variables of the system.
The paragraph in which Hicks sets out his variables is the main point of obscurity in an otherwise readable paper. His variable names are unintuitive and inconsistent with those used by Keynes which we adopt below. 
Some immediate consequences can be drawn. The 'first postulate of classical economics' asserts that the wage is equal to the marginal product, so we might be tempted to write:
Unfortunately this isn't quite correct, since it is necessary to differentiate "real" output and multiply the result by "P" rather than differentiating output in money terms. Hicks avoids this difficulty by giving the equation an unusual form, differentiating an independent with respect to a dependent variable [Px = "w" (dNx/d"x")]. He then gives a further equation [written "I"="wx" (dNx/d"x")+"wy" (dNy/d"y")] in which the price levels by sector determine the relation between output and income; but if we avoid representing income and output by different symbols we can dispense with this equation.
He remarks (in our notation) that since "Y" is a (monotonic) function of "N", once it is given "N" is given; but, since he is working in money units, there is an implicit assumption that "P" is given.
The 'classical' theory.
Hicks starts with the quantity theory of money:
where "V" is the velocity of money. [He himself writes "M"="kI" (where "k"=1/"V"). "k" is Keynes's symbol for the multiplier.]
His second equation can be written:
where I ("r") is 'the amount of investment (looked at as the demand for capital)' which is 'what becomes of the marginal-efficiency-of-capital schedule in Mr. Keynes's work'. "S"("Y","r") is the propensity to save (expressed as a function of money income). He suggests that the presence of "Y" as an argument to "S" is unnecessary given that it is by now determined by the quantity theory.
[This equation is expanded into two due to Hicks's proliferation of symbols. One equation in words is 'Investment = Saving': in symbols the two equations are Ix="C"("i") and Ix="S"("i","I"). "C" stands for 'capital' whereas for Keynes it stood for 'consumption'. So Hicks's "C"("i") is our I ("r") while his "S"("i","I") is our "S"("Y","r").]
The two equations as we have given them can be solved together for "Y" and "r"; and total employment is considered as determined by income "Y". 
Hicks sums up:
I think it will be agreed that we have here a quite reasonably consistent theory, and a theory which is also consistent with the pronouncements of a recognizable group of economists... Historically this theory descends from Ricardo... it is probably more or less the theory that was held by Marshall...
This is historically questionable; see below. 
In fact both of the equations Hicks takes from Keynes are part of the classical analysis. The quantity theory has precisely the sense Hicks gave to it. In classical theory the equation I ("r") = "S"("Y","r") is the equilibrium condition of the loans market and determines the rate of interest rather than the level of employment (see Keynes's Chapter 14). Hicks's pair of equations in money terms are complete as he gave them, containing only two variables, but this property would not necessarily apply to their classical counterparts in which some quantities would be given in real terms (see the "General Theory").
Mr Keynes's 'special' theory.
Hicks moves on to discuss industrial fluctuations in his §II, remarking that changes in the velocity of circulation can be related to changes in confidence, and asking whether velocity has not 'abdicated its status as an independent variable' [strictly he refers to his uninterpreted variable "k", which can be recognised as the reciprocal of velocity in classical theory]. He adds that 'this last consideration is powerfully supported by another' since 'on grounds of pure value theory, it is evident that the direct sacrifice made by a person who holds a stock of money is a sacrifice of interest'.
He now quotes Lavington (who also said that "It's all in Marshall, if one only digs deeply enough") as arguing that an individual will hold money up to the point at which the convenience of doing so is equal to the rate of interest. 
The demand for money depends on the rate of interest! The stage is set for Mr. Keynes.
He contrasts the equations of 'classical' theory:
with those adopted by Keynes:
These differ from the classical equations in two ways. On the one hand, the demand for money is conceived as depending upon the rate of interest (Liquidity Preference)...
and more surprisingly, as depending "solely" on the rate of interest, with no possible influence from the level of income. And:
On the other hand, any possible influence of the rate of interest on the amount saved out of a given income is neglected... this second amendment is a mere simplification, and ultimately insignificant.
The liquidity preference doctrine is that of Keynes's Chapter 13, rapidly superseded by his more comprehensive doctrine of Chapter 15. Its role in Keynes's theory is unclear. It provides no mechanism for ensuring equilibrium between supply and demand of loans, but Hicks argued elsewhere that this equilibrium would be ensured anyway by Walras's law.
Mr Keynes's 'general' theory.
Hicks revises the equations to take account of the Chapter 15 theory of liquidity preference:
'With this revision, Mr Keynes takes a big step back to Marshallian orthodoxy.' In fact Keynes considers liquidity preference to be the sum of two functions so that it may be written:
Here "L"1 is the sum of transactions and precautionary demands and "L"2 is speculative demand. The form "L"("Y","r") is slightly more general than Keynes's "L"1("Y") + "L"2("r") but the difference is purely notational.
The IS-LM model.
Having analysed Keynes's equilibrium system as a pair of simultaneous equations, Hicks then represents it graphically as two intersecting curves. The IS curve joins all the pairs (Y,r) which satisfy the "IS" equation I(r)=S(Y) and the LM curve joins the pairs which satisfy the "LM" equation L(Y,r)=M. The point of intersection of the two curves tells us the income Ŷ and the rate of interest r̂.
Under Keynes's Chapter 13 liquidity preference doctrine the LM curve will be a horizontal line. Under his Chapter 15 doctrine, if "L" is an increasing function of "Y" and a decreasing function of "r", then the LM curve will slope upwards. The IS curve always slopes downwards.
Source of the equations.
In Chapter 14 Keynes identified the equation I("r") = "S"("Y") as the main determinant of employment once its dependence on "r" has been eliminated through the liquidity preference function.
The discussion is presented in connection with a complicated diagram whose essential components are shown on the right. The vertical axis is saving/investment and the horizontal axis is the rate of interest. For a few representative levels of income he draws a curve showing the amount of saving which will take place for each level of income. One of these is shown as a solid red line; another, corresponding to a higher level of income, is shown as a dotted line. Both curves are increasing functions of "r", which may be no more than a concession to the classical theory which Keynes is criticising by opposing it to his own. He himself viewed saving as independent of "r", which would lead to functions plotted as horizontal red lines, but the analysis would be the same.
The saving curves are crossed by another set, each of which represents a different schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital. (In Chapter 14 he usually refers to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital as the 'investment demand-schedule'.) A single such curve "X"2"X"2' is drawn in blue on the right.
He begins the discussion by considering a given rate of interest "r"1, and then postulates that 'the investment demand-schedule shifts from "X"1"X"1' to "X"2"X"2'. He says that we are in the position of 'not knowing the appropriate "Y"-curve' and proceeds to give the following analysis:
If, however, we introduce the state of liquidity-preference and the quantity of money and these between them tell us that the rate of interest is "r"2, then the whole position becomes determinate. For the "Y"-curve which intersects "X"2"X"2' at a position vertically above "r"2 [i.e. the curve for that "Y" which satisfies I("r"2) = "S"("Y","r"2)], will be the appropriate curve...
and he concludes that:
The "X"-curve and the "Y"-curves tell us... what income will be, if from some other source we can say what the rate of interest is.
This points us back to Chapter 13 where Keynes has written that...
... the quantity of money is the other factor, which, in conjunction with liquidity-preference, determines the actual rate of interest... if "r" is the rate of interest, "M" the quantity of money and "L" the function of liquidity-preference, we have "M" = "L"("r").
The Chapter 15 theory of liquidity preference.
In Chapter 15 Keynes offers a new model of liquidity preference. He writes "M"1 and "M"2 as the amounts of money held in the first case for the transactions and precautionary motives combined, in the second for the speculative motive, and writes "L"1 and "L"2 as the associated demands. He then writes (on p199)
This is the source of Hicks's "M" = "L"("Y","r"). It follows that 'the quantity of money... in conjunction with liquidity-preference' can no longer determine the 'actual rate of interest' on their own and that the statement of Keynes's theory in Chapter 14 needs to be modified. 
It is not hard to see how to do this. Liquidity preference imposes a relationship between the interest rate and income for a given quantity of money, and this can be combined with the equation I("r") = "S"("Y") exactly as was done by Hicks. It is not a step which Keynes himself took. In his Chapter 18 'restatement' he recapitulates the account he has already presented in Chapter 14, but remarking in addition that a change in employment is liable 'to raise (or lower) the schedule of liquidity-preference' and that 'the position of equilibrium will be influenced by these repercussions'. Hicks put this in systematic form. When 'Mr Keynes and the Classics' was published, Keynes gave its "'IS-LL" equilibrium model' his 'largely unqualified acceptance'.
Properties of the IS-LM model.
Flatness of the LM curve.
Under Keynes's Chapter 13 liquidity preference doctrine the LM curve will be a horizontal line. Speaking more generally of the LM curve, Hicks says in §III that:
It will probably tend to be nearly horizontal on the left, and nearly vertical on the right. This is because there is (1) some minimum below which the rate of interest is unlikely to go, and (though Mr Keynes does not stress this) there is (2) a maximum to the level of income which can possibly be financed with a given level of money.
This argument needs to be considered with care, especially since the expression 'on the left' might be understood as meaning either for "Y"=–∞ or for "Y"=0.
The full orange line in the graph shows an LM curve satisfying Keynes's and Hicks's postulates. It corresponds to the liquidity preference function
and is a standard rectangular hyperbola. The 'maximum to the level of income which can possibly be financed with the given level of money' is "M" itself, and the 'minimum below which the rate of interest is unlikely to go' might be taken as either ε or ε+1/"M" according to preference, and ε can be taken as positive, negative, or zero to accommodate different views of this minimum. As "r" approaches ε from above the speculative demand for money becomes infinite, and "r" can decrease no further.
Hicks draws an LM function similar to the dashed line in the figure.
Effect of the inducement to invest on the rate of interest.
Hicks claims to have found in Keynes an assertion about 'an increase in the inducement to invest not raising the rate of interest'. Unfortunately, he doesn't say where this occurs and it is doubtful that Keynes ever made it so categorically. Boianovsky proposes two candidate locations. One of them is the first page of Chapter 13, but it is difficult to see anything there which supports Hicks's contention. The second is from near the end of Chapter 14, where Keynes says that:
... when investment changes, income must necessarily change in just that degree which is necessary to make the change in saving equal to the change in investment... the practical advice of economists has... assumed, in effect, that, cet. par., a decrease in spending will tend to lower the rate of interest and an increase in investment to raise it. But if what these two quantities determine is, not the rate of interest, but the aggregate volume of employment, then our outlook on the mechanism of the economic system will be profoundly changed.
This is not as clear-cut as Hicks's summary, and still leaves open the question of whether this remark is really part of Keynes's system. Coming as it does at the end of Chapter 14, it reflects the liquidity preference doctrine of Chapter 13 and takes no account of its being superseded by a more general (and incompatible) doctrine in Chapter 15.
Hicks justifies the view he has attributed to Keynes from the supposed possibility that the "LM" curve will be horizontal. If the downward-sloping IS curve shifts upwards in the region of r̂, then its intercept with the "LM" curve will normally move upwards and to the right, but if the "LM" curve is horizontal in the region of interest then the intercept will move purely rightwards. On these grounds Hicks concludes that when we are on the horizontal part of the "LM" curve: 
A rise in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital only increases employment, and does not raise the rate of interest at all.
The liquidity trap.
Hicks attaches importance to the existence of a lower limit on the interest rate and devotes a brief discussion to it. He points out that if the interest rate were negative then there would be no motive to lend, which introduces an initial lower bound, and adds that if the rate is very low, then there is more scope for it to increase than to decrease, with the result that people will hold onto money in the anticipation of rates increasing; and this phenomenon raises the effective lower limit.
He then asserts that the effect of an increase in the money supply is to shift the "LM" curve to the right. To be precise, if the money supply is increased by Δ"M" then the curve will be shifted to the right at any point ("Y","r") by an amount equal to Δ"M"/"L"1'("Y"). If we assume that "L"1("Y") is proportional to "Y", this amounts to a constant shift.
He concludes that if the intercept with the "IS" curve is on the presumed horizontal section of the "LM" curve, then 'merely monetary means will not force down the rate of interest any further'. He regards this possibility as distinguishing Keynes's economic theories from those of the classics, and as characterising them as 'the economics of depression'. 
In later economic circumstances the risk of speculators having an unsatisfiable demand for money disappeared. Hicks then wrote that 'in the inflationary conditions to which we have now become accustomed, it [the liquidity trap] is irrelevant'. But later still, deflation reappeared in Japan and economists such as Paul Krugman found the liquidity trap to have regained its practical significance.
Hicks's generalisations of Keynes's theory.
In §IV Hicks remarks that 'With the apparatus at our disposal, we are no longer obliged to make certain simplifications which Mr Keynes makes in his exposition'. He proposes to now write the saving function in a form equivalent to S(Y,r), thus allowing for 'any possible influence of the rate of interest upons saving'. Keynes did not deny such an influence, merely considering it 'secondary and relatively unimportant'.
And...
... what is more important, we can call in question the sole dependence of investment upon the rate of interest, which looks rather suspicious in the second equation ["sc." I("r") = "S"("Y")]. Mathematical elegance would suggest that we ought to have "I" and "i" [i.e. "Y" and "r"] in all three equations.
He goes on to remark that if current income is greater than that for which existing capital was planned, then 'an increase in the demand for consumers' goods' will increase the expected return from new investment, at any rate if the heightened income is not considered as merely transient. This is a plausible argument, but Keynes replied that the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital was already defined in terms of the expected return from new investment, and therefore took this effect into account without needing the extra parameter.
Hicks later accepted that it was 'quite un-Keynesian' to add income as a parameter to I(): 'The introduction was so tempting mathematically; but the temptation would have been better avoided'.
His third suggested generalisation is to incorporate adjustment of the money supply:
Instead of assuming, as before, that the supply of money is given, we can assume that there is a given monetary system... monetary authorities will prefer to create new money rather than allow interest rates to rise... Any change in liquidity preference or monetary policy will shift the "LL" [i.e. "LM"] curve...
Presumably we should write "M"("r") in place of "M". A similar dependence was proposed around the same time by Pigou. In Ambrosi's words:
According to Pigou the quantity of money is not given. It is a function of the rate of interest.
Modigliani's extension of Hicks's system.
The influence of Hicks's paper on subsequent work was partly through the extension of his model in Franco Modigliani's 'Liquidity preference and the theory of interest and money'.
Modigliani takes Hicks's equations (including the 'first postulate' which Keynes and Hicks had left to one side), expressing quantities in money terms (and therefore, like Hicks, assuming that the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital determines the amount of investment "in money terms" whose return will be greater than "r" – see wage unit). He concluded that 'except in a limiting case' it was 'rigid wages' which accounted for Keynesian unemployment. The limiting case was that of the liquidity trap.
Henry Hazlitt commented:
W. H. Hutt... has written: "Modigliani (whose 1944 article quietly caused more harm to the Keynesian thesis than any other single contribution) seems, almost unintentionally, to reduce to the absurd the notion of the coexistence of idle resources and price flexibility." Modigliani's article... seems to have particularly impressed the Keynesians because, beginning with the Keynesian vocabulary and many of the Keynesian concepts, he made alternative assumptions that led to some quite un-Keynesian conclusions.
Modigliani's conclusions were perfectly Hicksian, while Hicks was faithful to "some" of Keynes's words which in turn were unfaithful to others; and what counts as 'Keynesian' is for everyone to decide for themselves.
Hicks's interpretation of the "General Theory".
The formalism presented by Hicks is one in which unemployment is the consequence of artificially high wages rates. After sketching the "IS-LM" model in 'The classics again' he remarked that... 
... the only way in which it [the construction so far reached] differs from what was taught by 'classical' economists... is in the assumption it makes about the behaviour of wages – that they can flex upwards but not downwards; but this is a special assumption that can be incorporated into any theory.
On the other hand, the concepts of aggregate, or effective, demand are nowhere mentioned in 'Mr Keynes and the classics' (nor in Hicks's review of the "General Theory", or in 'The classics again', and only sketchily in "'IS-LM" – an explanation').
Keynes's own view is slightly enigmatic. In the years preceding the "General Theory" he had certainly attributed unemployment to excessive wage rates, without necessarily seeing wage cuts as a remedy. The account he developed in Books IV and V of the "General Theory" can be read as implying that wage rates are indeed responsible for unemployment, but this is not an inference he drew himself and is not his own interpretation of his theory. His own interpretation blames unemployment on a shortfall in aggregate demand which wage bargainers are powerless to change. 
The interpretation is set out in Chapter 3 where Keynes writes that:
Malthus, indeed, had vehemently opposed Ricardo's doctrine that it was impossible for effective demand to be deficient; but vainly... The great puzzle of effective demand with which Malthus had wrestled vanished from economic literature.
The nexus between the Book IV theory and the Chapter 3 interpretation is the portrayal of the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital as a demand function (which Hicks accepted). Hicks may be considered to have presented a "General Theory" free from any concept of aggregate demand.
Keynes made a similar remark in connection with Harrod's interpretation of the "General Theory" soon after its publication:
You don't mention effective demand or, more precisely, the demand schedule for output as a whole, except in so far as it is implicit in the multiplier. To me, the most extraordinary thing regarded historically, is the complete disappearance of the theory of the demand and supply for output as a whole, i.e. the theory of employment, "after" it had been for a quarter of a century the most discussed thing in economics.
Criticisms.
As travestying Keynes.
Bradford DeLong denied in a blog post that 'Mr Keynes and the Classics' was based on the "General Theory" at all, viewing it instead as combining "the monetarist theories of Irving Fisher, the financial-market insights of Knut Wicksell, and the multiplier insights of Richard Kahn into one package".
Portraying the classics as more Keynesian than they really were (Keynes).
It was immediately objected to 'Mr Keynes and the Classics' that no classical economist had held the views attributed to the school by Hicks. Hicks was able to find a few references to wage stickiness (e.g. in Hume and Mill, quoted in the prefatory note), but admitted that "it was misleading to call that minority view "the" 'classical' theory" ("id."). There is no evidence that the classics would have viewed the two "IS-LM" equations as constituting a system.
Keynes wrote to Hicks, concerning his attribution of Keynesian views to the classics, that:
The story you give is a very good account of the beliefs which, let us say, you and I used to hold.
Portraying Keynes as more classical than he really was.
Critics of Hicks's paper generally dissent from the 'neoclassical synthesis' which arose from it. Some (such as DeLong quoted above) consider Hicks to have been mistaken; others regard the error as lying in emphasis or omission.
Portraying Keynes as "less" classical than he really was.
In attributing to Keynes the view that in realistic circumstances the interest rate might be wholly insensitive to changes in the efficiency of capital, Hicks attached to Keynesianism a more radical doctrine than was found by other commentators (e.g. Hansen), reinforcing conservative economists' view of Keynes as a paradox-monger.
'Making saving a function of money income' (Keynes).
While broadly accepting the "IS-LM" formalism, Keynes pointed out an error in Hicks's presentation owing to his decision to work in money terms. As Ambrosi writes:
Apart from the alleged misrepresentation of the Classics, one of Keynes's criticisms of the Hicksian scheme was that he made 'saving a function of money income'.
The consequence was that a change in the value of money (e.g. a simultaneous doubling of wages and prices) would imply a change in the level of "real" saving according to Hicks, a result which Keynes had avoided by working in wage units.
'Assuming wages to be constant' (Kahn).
Hicks wrote that 'all expositors of Keynes' had found the use of wage units...
... to be a difficulty... We had to find some way of breaking the circle. The obvious way of doing so was to begin by setting out the rest... on the assumption of "fixed" money wages.
Kahn objected that:
The result, as Hicks points out, is the false impression that Keynes assumed wages to be constant at any level of employment short of full employment.
He claimed that "Hicks' procedure is completely unnecessary". Keynes explicitly declares wages to be exogenous on p247.
'Leaving out changes in money demand' (Ambrosi).
There is a grain of truth in criticism of the "IS-LM" scheme insofar as the "LM" part of the scheme clearly is unKeynesian in leaving out the changes in money demand generated by changes in income associated with movements along the "IS" curve when the rate of interest changed.
Unfaithful to Keynesian dynamics (Kaldor, Leijonhufvud, Kahn, Robinson).
This criticism appears in slightly different forms. Kaldor made the observation that Hicks's paper makes no reference to 'sudden variations in the MEC', i.e. to the marginal efficiency of capital.
Axel Leijonhufvud published a highly influential book in 1968 – 'Keynesian economics and the economics of Keynes' – criticising the direction Keynesian economics had taken under the influence of the "IS-LM" model. He argued that:
His [Keynes's] followers understandably decided to skip the problematical dynamic analysis of Chapter 19 and focus on the relatively tractable static IS-LM model.
The criticisms became sharper when Kahn published his 'Making of the General Theory' in 1984. He gave voice to his "belief that the IS-LM scheme has very seriously confused the development of economic thought". His argument seems to have been that "Keynes' insistence on the overwhelming importance of expectations, highly subject to risk and uncertainty, was one of his biggest contributions", but that "Keynes' attempt at simplification" by means of "schedules – simple relationships between two parameters" completely undermined it; and that Hicks's formulation gave a central position to this simplification.
In the same book Joan Robinson regretted that...
... modern teaching has been confused by J. R. Hicks' attempt to reduce the General Theory to a version of static equilibrium.
There are observations on uncertainty throughout the "General Theory": some are purely anecdotal while others, such as those related to the trade cycle, are embodied in Keynes's economic system (see The "General Theory"). It is nonetheless generally held that the analytic apparatus of the book is, as Schumpeter remarked, 'essentially static': the account of the trade cycle itself depends heavily on the static framework. Indeed:
when confronted with R. F. Kahn's (1984) condemnation of "IS-LM", Kaldor ("op. cit." p. 115) proclaimed the charges against this scheme as unsubstantiated and frankly disassociated himself from Kahn's position.
Kaldor added:
Honestly, all these years I didn't realize what all this about "IS-LM" being a misrepresentation of Keynes was about...
The charge against Hicks that he paid little attention to Keynes's dynamics is defensible. He did not hold Keynes's theory of the trade cycle in high esteem:
The record of the thirties, in major works on cycles, is outstanding, as was to be expected. I rather doubt whether Keynes's "General Theory" is to be put on the list; but there is no doubt about Harrod, and Haberler, and Schumpeter; and, of course, Hayek.
Inconsistent in its treatment of time (Hicks).
Hicks himself retracted his support for the "IS-LM" model in response to Leijonhufvud's criticisms and subsequently wavered in his view of it. In his 'IS-LM – an explanation' he gave an account which allows it very limited value.
The argument of this paper is hard to follow and has not been influential. He attributes to Keynes the view that commodity prices as well as wages are sticky, leading to a concept of equilibrium which applies only over a very short term, and concludes that the "IS-LM" model is useful only as a 'classroom gadget' or in analyses where 'even a drastic use of equilibrium methods' is 'not inappropriate'.
Leijonhufvud remarked subsequently that when Hicks...
...came to explain why he had become increasingly dissatisfied with it ['Mr Keynes and the Classics'] over the years, his reasons turned out to have almost nothing to do with the issues over which others were contending.

Never the Same Again (radio series)

Never the Same Again was a human interest radio series that ran for nine years on BBC Radio 4. As the evocative title suggests, presenter Jenni Mills talked with families about how they have resolved crises. Examples ranged from the rare (a family whose young daughter was abducted) to the commonplace (a couple adjusting to an elderly parent coming to live with them). Participants included well-known individuals (Marianne Wiggins, the wife of Salman Rushdie on living in hiding), as well as people outside of the public eye.
Throughout the material was deeply personal and moving. In some episodes participants talked about topics which at the time had been taboo. For example, having a gay son – an episode broadcast eight years before the emblematic "Mum I’ve got Something to Tell You".

Google for Startups (formerly known as Google for Entrepreneurs) is a startup program launched by Google in 2011. It consists of over 50 co-working spaces and accelerators in 125 countries, and provides hands-on lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. 
It partners with local startup communities as well as a network of co-working spaces popularly known as "Google Campus" (not to be confused with Googleplex) for tech startup entrepreneurs. It offers access to Google's devices as well as tools and workshops for the local tech community. Google has claimed that the startups in its Campuses have raised over $250 million and created more than 4600 new jobs.
History.
In March 2012, Campus London was first launched in East London, followed by Campus Tel Aviv later in December 2012. The first Asian Campus was opened in Seoul, South Korea in 2015. The first South American Campus was subsequently launched in 2016 in Sāo Paulo, Brazil.
Events held in the various Campuses differ by location, including language used in these events. Entrepreneurs or companies can apply to host these events, and they include workshops and conferences on tech topics such as blockchain, Internet of Things, fintech, machine learning, and cloud computing as well as other important practical skills for entrepreneurs such as digital marketing, product management, and intellectual rights. Other events include hackathons as well as startup residency programs for entrepreneurs and even free yoga and mindfulness sessions for entrepreneurs. 
From time to time, Google employees are deployed to conduct workshops (such as sales training, technical discussions, pioneering philosophical thought experiments) as well as conferences with Google-related products and platforms such as the Google Cloud Platform.
In October 2018, Google for Entrepreneurs was renamed as Google for Startups.
Locations.
As of 2019, its Campuses are located in 7 different cities spanning across Europe, Asia, and South America:
Campus Berlin.
In 2017, another Campus location was planned to be launched in the neighborhood of Kreuzberg in Berlin, Germany. This led to concerns from local residents on the gentrification of the area. This issue has further escalated in September 2018 when protestors from Berlin-based "occupy" group temporarily occupied the building site and where at least six people were arrested according to eyewitness reports. 
Some have criticized that Campus has led to too many light app startups instead of truly disruptive ones. Other criticisms include Google utilizing its Campuses for its marketing purposes rather than truly developing the startup community. 
In October 2018, Google dropped plans to open its Berlin campus after pressure by local campaigners and stated that the site would now belong to two local charities.

In 2019, a successor called "Horizon Chase Turbo" was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation Vita via a Play-Asia physical release, one of the last of such for the system. This version includes enhanced graphics, more cars and tracks, and presents new features like couch co-op.
Gameplay.

Additional twists to the racing formula come in the form of fuel pickups which need to be obtained to complete the race, as well as tokens that unlock new tracks and the use of nitro boosts to speed up the player's car. The player starts every race at the back of the pack, and is required to pass opponents to win. There are also different weather effects and track types that affect handling.
Development.
The game's soundtrack was composed by Barry Leitch, who was contacted due to his work on "Top Gear", a racing game released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

The remixes were later released as part of the soundtrack and a cover of the popular Las Vegas track from Top Gear was included as an Easter Egg.

Harry Slater of "Pocket Gamer" rated the game a 9/10, calling it "a bright and brash arcade racer that looks stunning", while saying that its gameplay is good enough to back up its presentation. He noted that the game got "a little grindy at times", though calling it "the type of grind you're happy to wade through". The site awarded the game the "Gold" award. Tom Christiansen of Gamezebo rated the game 3.5/5 stars, calling the visuals "solid" and praising the soundtrack, but saying he disliked the auto-turn assist system that was impossible to turn off, also calling the AI "impossibly fast" and unlocking new cars overly difficult.

St Mark's Church, Darling Point

St Mark's Church is an active Anglican church in Darling Point, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is part of a significant local heritage group that includes the church, rectory, and adjacent cottage. The group forms part of a large collection of important to late 19th century buildings of considerable townscape, historic and cultural significance, including the former St Mark's Crescent School, St Mark's Cottage and Bishopscourt, formerly "Greenoaks".
History.
Constructed between 1848 and 1880, St Mark's Church was designed by Colonial Architect to New South Wales, Edmund Blacket, in an early Victorian Rustic Gothic Revival style with nave, chancel, vestries, organ chamber, tower and spire; made of Sydney sandstone with hardwood timber shingled roofs. The church was completed in 1854 with the spire, a gift from William Laidley, added later. In 1861 the church was extended to the west to include the porch and gallery. Prior to completion of this building, accommodation for worshippers in this section of the parish of Alexandria was provided by Thomas Ware Smart of Mona, who converted one of his cottages in Mona Lane in the Chapel of St Mark. In 1863 Wolliam Bradley of Lindesay built at his expense, the present vestries.
St Mark's Church is one of the best known Anglican parish churches in Australia and has become a popular wedding venue hosting such famous weddings as Elton John's first marriage and the fictional wedding in the film "Muriel's Wedding". Social photographer Sam Hood captured many socialite weddings during the 1930s.
Leadership.
Established under the patronage of Bishop William Grant Broughton, the inaugural incumbent at St Marks' was Reverend George Fairfowl Macarthur, who also served as the proprietor of St Mark's School which he conducted first at the Rectory, then at , and afterwards at The Kings School, Parramatta.
The current rector, since 2013, is Rev. Dr Michael Jensen, a son of the former archbishop of Sydney, The Most Reverend Peter Jensen.

Foundation of Light

The Foundation of Light (Previously called the "SAFC Foundation") is a Registered Charity in the United Kingdom, and is the independent charitable foundation of professional football club Sunderland A.F.C. It is the biggest football charity in the UK.
It was founded on 6 September 2001 by Sunderland chairman Bob Murray. The charity's patron is Sophie, Countess of Wessex and the Chief executive officer is Lesley Spuhler OBE.
History.
In 1988, Sunderland took part in the 'Community Programme in Professional Football’, a scheme aimed at encouraging links between football clubs and their local communities. This became the 'Football in the Community' initiative in the early 1990s, which Sunderland were involved in from the beginning.
In September 2001, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced the separation of Sunderland's charitable and community work from the mainstream club activity, andt the independent SAFC Foundation was created. The foundation was initially supported with funding from Sunderland A.F.C., Northern Rock and the Coalfields Regeneration Trust.
The Foundation's main charitable aim is to:Advance the education (including the social and physical training) of children and young persons attending schools and clubs in the area, through the use of football and other sports activities as educational tools and thereof to provide facilities for meetings, lectures and classes for the benefit of such young children and young persons. Within a year, the Foundation had a staff of 70 who engaged with school children in 280 schools, predominantly in Sunderland and County Durham. Initially, classrooms within the Academy of Light were used for the Foundation, as well as two mobile double-decker buses containing specialist classrooms. The custom-built "Centre for Light" opened in 2004, a £1.6m learning facility built within the Stadium of Light. The centre included five learning areas supporting up to 120 visiting children per day.
The Foundation regularly undertakes various fund-raising activities. In 2011, it collaborated with Durham Cathedral on a 'Carols of Light' event. The event was produced by Tim Rice and included music performances from Thomas Allen, former Animals member Alan Price, and Sunderland based band The Futureheads. Readings were performed by SAFC Foundation Trustee and former player Niall Quinn, in addition to other sports and media celebrities including journalist Kate Adie, and presenter Steve Cram.
In 2012, the SAFC Foundation was rebranded as the Foundation of Light.
In 2015, the Foundation was granted permission to open a free school next to the Stadium of Light. The Sunderland Centre for Opportunity (SCOO) would offer opportunities for vulnerable children who struggle in mainstream education.
In September 2018, the Beacon of Light opened, and became the new official home of the Foundation of Light. The £20m, five-storey building, which sits alongside the Stadium of Light, includes indoor sports courts, indoor and outdoor artificial turf pitches, as well as classrooms and learning spaces.
After purchasing the club in May 2018, Sunderland chairman Stewart Donald joined the Foundation of Light board of trustees on 11 October 2018.
Financials.
In 2017, the Foundation of Light raised £11.1m and spent £4.1m. It had £17.8m in assets and £5.5m in liabilities. There were 130 employees and 42 volunteers. Over 300,000 people have been helped by the Foundation since it was created.

Magong Chenghuang Temple

Magong Chenghuang Temple () is a temple in Magong, Penghu, Taiwan. This temple mainly serves Chenghuangye, means "the lord of City". (Chinese: 城隍爺; pinyin: "Chéng-huáng-yé"), a taoist God, who is in charge of the underworld of an administrative district ( a little similar to Hades), so it was translated to "the City God" usually.
History.
By tradition way, there is only one Chenghuang Temple in each county or city, and is next to the city hall always. But there are two Chenghuang temples in Penghu County you can see in the present. The original city hall of Penghu (澎湖廳署) was located at Wenao (文澳) district, so the Chenghuang Temple was built in there as well.
But Wenao Chenghuang Temple was too narrow to express the residents' respect enough. Hence, In 1777, XIE Wei-Qi (Chinese: 謝維祺; pinyin: "Xiè wéi qí" ),an officer of Penghu (澎湖海防糧補通判) during Qing Dynasty, who suggested establish another one in Magong harbour area. The new one was completed in 1779.
This temple was ever damaged during the Sino-French War in 1885. That moment, many people said they saw Chenghuangye appearing for protecting them from war and insecurity. After the war was over and French navy retreated in the autumn of 1885, Chenghuang Temple finished repairing in the next year, according to folk story of miracle, Guangxu Emperor promoted Magong Chenghuangye's religious rank.
Afterwards, Magong Chenghuangye named "Lin Ying Hou" (Chinese: 靈應侯; pinyin: "líng yīng hóu" ) as well. The meaning of Lin Ying Hou, its first character Lin (靈) means "spirit"; and the second character Ying (應) means "feel" or "answer"; the third character Hou (侯), means " one of ranks of Chinese nobilIty". So, Lin Ying Hou (靈應侯) means that this lord of god who will show its spirit to answer you, or you can feel the spirit appear.
Architecture.
In addition, Magong Chenghuang Temple also collected a plenty of beautiful wooden carvings, colorful paintings, historic sign boards or steles, very worthy to take time to discover.

Valtteri Laurell Pöyhönen

Valtteri Laurell Pöyhönen (born September 23, 1978, in Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish jazz guitarist, pianist, composer, bandleader and producer. He is best known as bandleader and composer of the 20-headed Ricky-Tick Big Band and the award-winning jazz-sextet Dalindèo.
Biography.
Valtteri Laurell Pöyhönen grew up in Helsinki, Finland. In 2010 Pöyhönen finished his master studies in jazz composition from the jazz department of the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. He has also studied at the Conservatoire de Paris, the Codarts and Helsinki's Pop and Jazz Conservatory. Since 2009, Pöyhönen has divided his time between Berlin and Helsinki.
Groups.
Dalindèo.
In 2003, Pöyhönen founded the jazz-sextet Dalindèo. The group's line-up consists of Valtteri Laurell Pöyhönen (guitar, bandleader), Jose Mäenpää (trumpet), Petri "Pope" Puolitaival (saxophone and flute), Rasmus Pailos (percussion), Pekka Lehti (double-bass, from summer 2004 on) and Jaska Lukkarinen (drums). Dalindèo's early music was a fusion between Brazilian jazz, hard bop and exotica. From 2013 onwards, heavy surf guitars and rockabilly-sounds have been prominent in the group's sound. The group's fourth studio album "Kallio" became a huge success, and received the prestigious Emma-award as "Jazz Album of the Year" in 2013.
Ricky-Tick Big Band.
In 2009, after studying composition for a year in Paris, Pöyhönen founded the Ricky-Tick Big Band. The 16-member big band took its name from the Helsinki-based record label Ricky-Tick Records, and the original line-up included many of the label's artists, including saxophonist Timo Lassy and trumpetist Jukka Eskola. The group released their self-titled debut album "Ricky-Tick Big Band" in 2010.

In 2012, Pöyhönen met with rapper Paleface and drummer Jaska Lukkarinen to contemplate a collaboration of big band jazz and rap. This resulted in the forming of the 20-piece Ricky-Tick Big Band &amp; Julkinen Sana, with rappers Paleface, Tommy Lindgren and Redrama. The group's debut album "Burnaa" was released in 2013 and was a critical success, debuting at number four on the Finnish national album chart and staying in the Top 10 for 11 weeks. Consequently, the group toured all over Finland in jazz and rock festivals. The group's second album "Korottaa Panoksii" was released in October 2015, again followed by extensive touring all over Finland.
Other works.

Ngalia (Northern Territory)

The Ngaliya (Ngalia) are an indigenous Australian people of the Northern Territory who speak a dialect of the Warlpiri language. They are not to be confused with the Ngalia of the Western Desert.
Country.
The traditional lands of the Ngalia, in Norman Tindale 's estimation, extended over some . He places them to the north of Stuart Bluff Range from West Bluff west to Mounts Cockburn and Carey, at mounts Ethel Creek, Farewell, Singleton, Saxby and Doreen. Their territory also took in Cockatoo Creek, the Treuer Range, Mount Davenport and Vaughan Springs (aka Pikilji/Pikilyi).
History of contact.
Carl Strehlow was the first outsider to mention the Ngalia. Some studies were made of them in August 1931, and in the same month in 1952, at Cockatoo Creek by members of anthropological expeditions from the University of Adelaide. On the first occasion, one Ngalia youth, advancing through the degrees of his initiation, recited a list
of over 300 toponyms referring to the totemic sites along his tribe's dreaming tracks which he had visited the year before as part of his education. The landscape names remained unpublished because of the complexities of pinning down the precise location of each place name in this initiatory journey. Charles P. Mountford published a work detailing the 'totemic topography' marked by the travels of the serpent "Jarapiri" as it slithered across Warlpiri and Ngalia country, to "Wimbaraku", situated between Mount Liebig and Haast's Bluff.
In the early 1950s their numbers were estimated to be 300-400.

Carlo Fornara

Carlo Fornara (21 October 1871 – 15 September 1968) was an Italian neo-impressionist and divisionist painter.
Biography.
Born in Prestinone (Craveggia) into a humble family of Valle Vigezzo farmers in 1871, his talent emerged after he began attending courses in painting, drawing and ornamentation at the local Rossetti Valentini Art School in Santa Maria Maggiore, where he became close friends with other future painters such as Giovanni Battista Ciolina, Gian Maria Rastellini and Lorenzo Peretti Junior, and absorbed the teachings of Enrico Cavalli, a great connoisseur of the French art of the time, who decisively influenced him to follow the path of painting.
In the spring of 1891 he exhibited two works, "La bottega del calderaio (The Tinker’s Workshop)" and "Ricordanze (Remembrance)", at the First Triennale of Brera, a vitally important occasion because there he made contact for the first time with the arising divisionist movement. However, during his stay in Lyon, from 1894 to 1895, in the company of his friend and fellow painter Giovanni Battista Ciolina, Fornara drew closer to the neo-impressionist movement, as he manifested in the work "En plein air" which was, however, refused in 1897 by the Third Biennale of Brera, despite being judged very positively by artists such as Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo and Giovanni Segantini, two of the leading exponents of divisionism.
In 1899 he took part in the in Venice.
He made the acquaintance of Alberto Grubicy de Dragon, owner of the Grubicy Gallery and brother of the promoter of divisionism in Europe, the art dealer Vittore Grubicy de Dragon, himself a painter, and impressed them both. They put him in touch with Segantini, who employed the young artist as his assistant at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. Thanks to the patronage of the Grubicys, Fornara’s work was presented at all the national and international painting exhibitions of any importance in those years, but his adherence to the divisionist school gradually began to wane until it finally petered out altogether during the 1920s, when the artist began his own painting research in a completely personal style. In 1922 he definitively retired to his beloved Val Vigezzo, where he died in 1968.

Faith Compton Mackenzie

Faith Compton Mackenzie or Lady Mackenzie (née Stone; 26 February 1878 – 9 July 1960) was an author known for memoirs of her travels around Europe.
Early life and education.
Faith Nona Stone was born in February 1878, the daughter of Elizabeth Theresa "Lily" Vidal (1841-1898, the only daughter of novelist Mary Theresa Vidal and Rev. Francis Furse Vidal) and Edward Daniel Stone, a Greek and Latin schoolmaster at Eton College. She was one of 10 children, including notable younger brother Christopher Stone, and attended the Francis Holland School for Girls in London. 
Between 1901 and 1905 she was an actress, under the stage name "Faith Reynolds", in Sir Charles Hawtrey's company, appearing in London and New York, initially in his production of "A Message from Mars". In 1903 she appeared with Hawtrey and Arthur Playfair in Hawtrey's production of F. Anstey's play "The Man from Blankley's" in London, New York, Washington DC, Detroit and Chicago. During these years she knew the Irish artist Althea Gyles, on whom the character of Ariadne Burden in "Tatting" (1957) was later based.
On 30 November 1905, Faith Stone married the writer Compton Mackenzie in St Saviour's, Pimlico.
Career and later life.
Between 1913 and 1920, Mackenzie lived with her husband on Capri at Villa Solitaria, an Italian island near Sorrento. Mackenzie was known for her own talent on the piano, and during her time on Capri she had an affair with the Italian pianist Renata Borgatti.
At times, Mackenzie and her husband lived apart. From 1920, Compton Mackenzie was tenant of the Channel Islands of Herm and Jethou. During this time D. H. Lawrence dined with Faith in Capri. She was the inspiration behind the story 'Two Blue Birds', and was unhappy that he had written such a "monstrous perversion of facts" based on their dinner conversation.
From 1930, the Mackenzies lived on the Scottish island Eilean Aigas, and it is from this period onwards that Mackenzie began to write. She began with historical biographies in the early 1930s.
In 1933, the Mackenzies relocated to Barra, where they built a house named 'Suidheachan' (the sitting-down place). She reportedly had a "passion for furnishing new houses" that fortunately matched her husband's passion for acquiring new islands. By the late 1930s, Mackenzie became best known for volumes of memoirs describing her life in places such as Capri, Paris, Rome, Milan, Guernsey and Barra.
By the mid 1940s, the Mackenzies were no longer living on islands and had bought Denchworth Manor near Wantage. In 1950, Lady Mackenzie bought a stuffed tabby cat at Portobello Market that was purported to be Crimean Tom, the famous survivor of the war in Sebastopol. It is now in the National Army Museum. A portrait of Lady Mackenzie from November 1955 is held by the National Portrait Gallery.
Faith Compton Mackenzie died on 9 July 1960.

Just So Happens

Just So Happens is a studio album by American jazz bassist Gary Peacock and guitarist Bill Frisell released on the Postcard Records label in 1994.
Reception.
David R. Adler of Allmusic wrote "Gary Peacock's duo album with Bill Frisell is rewarding, though a bit repetitive. Most interesting is the sonic contrast between Peacock's imposing upright bass and Frisell's quirky electric guitar. After eight tracks, however, the appearance of Frisell's acoustic guitar -- on the standard "Good Morning, Heartache"—comes as a welcome change. Most of the pieces are free improvisations, and while they all have their moments, some wind up treading water. "In Walked Po," an oblique take on the blues, is an exception. "Reciprocity" and "N.O.M.B." are the only originals credited solely to Peacock, leading one to believe they were written before the session. Perhaps not surprisingly, these two tracks are the most coherent on the record. The duo also plays two versions of "Home on the Range" (one would have sufficed), and Peacock renders "Red River Valley" as an unaccompanied solo. For Frisell, at least, this could have been a sign of things soon to come: His Nashville album was released about a year later."

Hoy and West Mainland National Scenic Area

Hoy and West Mainland is a national scenic area (NSA) covering parts of the islands of Hoy and Mainland in the Orkney Islands of Scotland, as well as parts of the surrounding sea. It is one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development. The Hoy and West Mainland NSA covers 24,407 ha in total, consisting of 16,479 ha of land with a further 7928 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide).
National scenic areas are primarily designated due to the scenic qualities of an area, however NSAs may well have other special qualities, for example related to culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. Hoy and West Mainland includes one of the six World Heritage Sites in Scotland, and there are several Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas within the NSA.
Creation of the national scenic area.
Following the Second World War, a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider preservation of the landscape in Scotland. The report, published in 1945 proposed that five areas (Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar-Glen Affric-Glen Cannich) should receive a level of protection. Accordingly, the government designated these areas as "national park direction areas", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, additional areas, including the northern part of the island of Hoy and the western part of the Orkney mainland, were identified as worthy of protection due to their landscape qualities. Accordingly, in 1981 the direction areas were replaced by the national scenic area designation, which were based on the 1978 recommendations and thus included the area entitled Hoy and West Mainland. The defined area remains as originally mapped in 1978, but was redesignated under new legislation in 2010.
Although the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities (in this case Orkney Islands Council) can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway have current management strategies.
Landscape and scenery.
The bold, rounded hills of North Hoy are a dominant feature across the area, and contrast with the pastoral landscape of West Mainland.
Human activity has played an important part in producing the current landscape, with the neolithic monuments of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney sitting at the heart of the scattered farm steadings and stone dykes surrounding the Loch of Stenness.
The dramatic coastline of Hoy greets visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has extremes of many kinds: some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John's Head, which reach 350 m; a light-stone precarious sea stack taller than the facing cliff – the Old Man of Hoy; patches of northernmost scattered, hardy woodland and the remote possibility of locally extant Orkney charr ("Salvelinus inframundus") documented in 1908 at Heldale Water. The most northerly Martello Towers stand here built to defend the south entrance to Scapa Flow at Longhope in 1814 towards the end of the Napoleonic War, never used in combat. The highest point in the archipelago, Ward Hill, is on Hoy.
West Mainland by contrast presents a softer landscape, described by SNH as "a palimpsest of geology, topography, archaeology and land use". The area shows evidence of having been settled and farmed for many thousands of years. The view of the town of Stromness, and its link with the sea were also identified as "special qualities" of the area by Scottish Natural Heritage.
The national scenic area includes the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, a group of Neolithic monuments found in the West Mainland portion of the area. The name was adopted by UNESCO when it proclaimed these sites as a World Heritage Site in 1999. The site of patrimony currently consists of four sites:
There are also neolithic remains on Hoy, the most prominent of which is a megalithic chambered tomb carved out of a titanic block of Devonian Old Red Sandstone, and known as the Dwarfie Stane, which lies in the Rackwick valley on the edge of the national scenic area. It is the only chambered tomb in Orkney that is cut from stone rather than built from stones and may be the only example of a Neolithic rock-cut tomb in Britain.
Conservations designations.
There are three Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) within the NSA:
The Hoy portion of the NSA, along with much of the adjoining sea area, is designated as a Special Protection Area due to its importance for nine breeding bird species: arctic skua, fulmar, great black-backed gull, great skua, guillemot, black-legged kittiwake, peregrine falcon, puffin and red-throated diver. The area is important for it seabird assemblage, which regularly supports 120,000 individual seabirds during the breeding season.

Michael Bloch (barrister)

Michael Gordon Bloch QC (born 18 October 1951) is a British barrister, a member of Blackstone Chambers. 
Life.
Born at Hampstead, a son of the marriage of John Bloch and Thelma E. Platzky, Bloch was educated at Bedales School, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA and MA, and the University of East Anglia, where he gained the degree of M.Phil. He was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1979.
In 1975 Bloch married firstly Caroline S. Williams, in Wandsworth. They had two daughters, Susannah and Claudia Bloch.
Bloch first joined the One Essex Court Chambers, and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1998. The same year, he married secondly Lady Camilla Bingham, a fellow barrister and one of the daughters of Lord Lucan.
In September 2000 Bloch moved from One Essex Court to Wilberforce Chambers. In 2013 he resigned from there to join Blackstone Chambers, which was reported as a significant boost for Blackstone, filling a gap in commercial and arbitration law left by the departure of Thomas Beazley QC.
Notable cases.
In March 2004 Bloch appeared in the Court of Appeal representing the Bankers Trust in the case of Department of Economic Policy and Development of the City of Moscow v Bankers Trust Company and International Industrial Bank, before Sir Andrew Morritt, Mance LJ and Carnwath LJ. The case was to decide whether a judgment dismissing an application to challenge an arbitration award should be published. The Court found that in general the public interest required judgments to be published, but in this instance it decided that the judgment at issue should not be.
In 2008 Bloch acted for Lucasfilm in its dispute with the British engineer Andrew Ainsworth of Shepperton Design Studios over the rights to the stormtrooper helmets as used in "Star Wars". In 2011 this case arrived in the Supreme Court as Lucasfilm Ltd v Ainsworth, in which Bloch and Jonathan Sumption QC represented Lucasfilm. The Court decided that the Star Wars Stormtrooper helmet was not a sculpture for the purposes of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
In 2013 Bloch was leading counsel for Nestlé in its battle with Cadburys over the purple colour of its "Dairy Milk" bar wrappers.
In 2014 he appeared in the High Court for Lush Cosmetics, who successfully challenged Amazon's use of the word "LUSH", their registered trade mark, as a Google Adword and for directing Amazon web customers searching for "Lush" to similar products made by competitors. John Baldwin QC, sitting as a deputy judge, held that Amazon had thereby infringed the trade mark under Directive 2008/95/EC, and that the two Amazon defendants, one incorporated in the United Kingdom and the other in Luxembourg, were jointly liable, as they had "joined together and agreed to work together in the furtherance of a common plan".
In 2016 Bloch represented Simon Le Bon, Duran Duran, and other defendants in the High Court case of Gloucester Place Music Ltd v Simon Le Bon &amp; Others, which resulted in a judgement by Mr Justice Arnold likely to have significant implications in the recorded music industry.

Werner Laux

Werner Laux (15 April 1902 – 14 May 1975) was a German painter, university teacher and arts official. He was something of a party stalwart: between 1952 and 1956 he served as rector (head) of the at Berlin-Weissensee.
Life.
Werner Laux was born in Berlin. His father was a postal official. Between 1919 and 1922 he undertook an apprenticeship in skilled factory work, the sector in which he was initially employed. From 1923 till 1925 he studied at the Beuth Academy ("Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin") and then at the Royal School of Art in Berlin, training as a teacher of arts and graphic drawing. During 1925/26 he was taught by at the . He then worked as a freelance artist between 1926 and 1931.
By the later 1920s, with the economic situation still precarious, there was a steady increase in political polarisation. Werner Laux joined the Communist Party in 1929. It was, however, the Nazi Party that took power in January 1933, losing no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship.

In April 1946, following a contentious political merger, a new party was launched, and Laux was one of hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members who immediately signed their party membership over to the new Socialist Unity Party ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" / SED), which now became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Between 1946 and 1948 Werner Laux headed up the Käthe Kollwitz Arts Academy ("Käthe-Kollwitz-Kunstschule") in Berlin-Reinickendorf. During 1948/49 he served as a senior arts administrator for the in Mecklenburg.

Award and celebration.
Obituary reports for members of the East German party establishment were generally highly formulaic. Nevertheless, even by the standards of the time and place, the one published in respect of Werner Laux by the party newspaper, Neues Deutschland, was exceptionally fulsome:

Toko Lay

"Some of this article is translated from the existing German Wikipedia article at ; see its history for attribution."
Toko Lay (in English "store Lay") is a building in the center of Dili, East Timor. Built in 1959, during the Portuguese colonial era, it served as a refuge during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. The building was also damaged during the violence of September 1999.
The building was historically a store owned by the Lay family, a Timorese family of Chinese descent. It is located on Rua 25 de Abril, in Colmera suco.
Indonesian invasion of Timor.
From August 1975 to December 1975, as political instability grew in Timor, many people left their homes and took refuge in the bigger buildings of Dili, such as Toko Lay.
On the morning of December 7, 1975, around 20 people of Chinese ethnicity were in the building as the Indonesian army invaded Dili. When Indonesian soldiers ordered the occupants to leave the building, Tsam Yi Tin, who was in the building next door, came out and was shot dead. His son was also shot but survived.
After the occupants came out of the building, they were taken to the waterfront, where soldiers pretended to kill them by cocking their guns. Eventually, women and children were released and were told to go to the Chinese school. In the next few days, men were ordered to dig several graves for Indonesian and East Timorese victims, some of whom they knew.
In 2012, a mass grave containing the bodies of 72 people, likely of Chinese ethnicity, was found at the national government palace, just near the Toko Lay building. It's unclear whether the grave dates to World War II or to the Indonesian invasion of 1975.

Balance of the Planet

Balance of the Planet is a 1990 environmental-based educational simulator developed by Chris Crawford and published on DOS, Macintosh, and PC-98.
Development.
Chris Crawford was approached in early 1989 by Epyx's Joe Miller about working on an environmental game to coincide with the film "Voice of the Planet" to be released for Earth Day 1990. While wary of licensed games, he developed a design concept that explored the intricate connections between ecological and economic factors. He created a hypertext system to house his game. In order to place values into the game (e.g. whether the economic value of a factory is worth the deaths from air pollution), Crawford was forced to place a value on human life; he spent a lot of time treading on eggshells before conceding that no matter what value-based decisions he made he would be accused of bias. Crawford designed the title as a serious game; to be very educational but not necessarily a lot of fun. Crawford self-published the game in April 1990. Incredible Technologies ported the game to MS-DOS from the original Macintosh version. 
In 2012, Crawford created a Kickstarter project for a remake of "Balance of the Planet", which would be made free on the internet. He didn't take into account that donors would be wary to pay for a project that might never be released or fall way behind schedule. For this reason, he asserted that "Balance of the Planet"'s Kickstarter became a dismal failure. 264 backers pledged a total of $13,594 out of a $150,000 fund goal.
Gameplay.
The gameplay sees the player balance global economic and ecological forces through taxation and expenditure, with each policy change having a runoff effect to other areas. For instance, clearing forests changes the level of CO2 in the air, which affects global warming. The game has a procedural system with limited user interaction.
Chris Crawford notes that it is difficult to "win" level one due to the state the planet is already in.
Reception.
Chris Lombardi reviewed the game for "Computer Gaming World", and stated that "I respect the designer for having the courage to risk everything for his convictions. Still, if the game is not fun, it simply wouldn't be right to endorse it for gamers who expect to be entertained by their entertainment software."
In the July 1990 edition of "The Games Machine", the reviewer thought the game would be perfect to play in schools and colleges due to being educational, easy to use, and quick to play. 
In the July 1990 edition of "Games International" (Issue 16), Brian Walker liked the tone of the game, commenting, "The stylised messages on each screen advising of all the nasties around us are superbly rendered while the content strikes just the right note: neither hectoring or patronising." He did find "heavy-handed humour in the manual gets to be a bit wearing but otherwise it is a fine and comprehensive effort." Walker concluded by giving the game above average ratings of 8 out of 10 for both gameplay and graphics, saying, "You'd have to be a right plonker not to find "Balance of the Planet" fascinating in some way." 
In the November 1990 edition of "Macworld", Tom Moran noted the serious nature of the game, stating that "the results are rather grim ... you'll get some improvements in the state of the ecology, but you'll most likely get the soul-shivering message that millions have starved to death during your administration." They noted that "Balance of the Planet" contains some interesting information in regards to ecology, but criticized its "uninteresting interface" and "too little information on how the simulation works", remarking that "[t]he most obvious way to find out the gross effects of any of the more than 20 variables is to slog it out with the empirical method: change only one variable to its maximum value, step through all nine stages of the game, note the results, start over, change the same variable to its minimum value, and repeat the process." "Macworld" was frustrated by this trial and error tedium to discern the meaning behind the manipulatable variables.
In the January 1991 edition of "Compute Magazine", Richard O. Mann wrote that the game offered a challenging, intellectual, effective, and thoughtful consideration of the "ultimate puzzle" that world leaders face on a day-to-day basis. 
In December 1991 edition of "Environmental History Review", Dan Holder appreciated that the title challenged the common desire for people to find simple solutions to complex problems.
In a retrospective reviews in the 2010 book "Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames", Ian Bogost felt the game was sophisticated, complex, and expressive.

Generally, CIP's are either those who export products or those regarding businesses. CIP's primary list is prepared based on the amount of export, income tax and value-added tax (VAT), the type of business, employment, etc. Afterward, the people who qualify are selected for the honor.

Plot.
Sangram "Simmba" Bhalerao (Ranveer Singh) is an antiheroic orphan from Shivgarh, the same town where Bajirao Singham was raised. He observes how policemen make money in the form of bribes, finding himself motivated to become a police officer, and succeeds. Getting bribes from some local thieves and a jeweller, Simmba enjoys and takes full advantage of the lifestyle of a corrupt cop.
He is soon transferred to Miramar police station, where he sees Shagun Sathe (Sara Ali Khan) and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets his fellow policemen and one of his juniors, Nityanand Mohile (Ashutosh Rana), who is an honest constable, hesitates to salute Simmba as he's a corrupt cop. To prove his worth in Miramar, he interrupts a pub party run by Durva Yashwant Ranade (Sonu Sood)'s brothers, Sadashiv "Sada" Ranade and Gaurav "Giri" Ranade and demands more money from them, whilst promising that he will let them continue with their illegal activities. Durva agrees and uses Simmba to free a land from an old person Vaaman Rao (Arun Nalawade), who is forced to sign the papers by Simmba. Meanwhile, Simmba develops motherly and sisterly bonds with several women and girls, one of whom happens to be Aakruti Dave (Vaidehi Parashurami), a young woman who reminds Simmba of his teacher.
Aakruti files a complaint against Sada and Giri for dealing illicit drugs in their pub and using children as peddlers. Simmba initially ignores this after being pacified by Durva, and Shagun, in the meantime, falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Aakruti learns about the drug racket in the club and goes there one night with Chotu, a mute boy who's her student. She videotapes by cell phone to show evidence to the police, but is caught by Sada and Giri. Chotu discreetly records Sada and Giri assaulting Aakruti and flees once both of them realise.
Aakruti is brutally raped and murdered by Sada and Giri. Chotu tries to tell Akruti's friend Kavya (Neha Mahajan) about Akruti being in danger. Kavya whilst being chased by Durva's goons, goes to Simmba to file Aakruti's missing complaint. Aakruti is found injured in hospital. Simmba tries to talk to her, but she dies, leaving him devastated. Police recover the phone, and the video, and Durva sends his goons to get the phone from Simmba, who is present, mends his ways, and fights them all. Simmba finally wears his police uniform, and seeing this change in him, Mohile finally salutes him as they arrest Sada and Giri. He apologises to Vaaman Rao, and returns the land swindled from him. In the court, Simmba is shocked to find Aakruti's video being deleted. He beats up Durva's friend, corporator David Cameron (Vipin Sharma), who gave a false statement in the court, leading to his suspension orders. He decides to kill Sada and Giri before he goes, and plans to show it as an encounter. He shoots them both and shows as if he killed them in the act of self-defence. An SIT committee is set up by the state, who question Simmba's encounter. Aiming to achieve clarity to the situation, Home Minister Vinayak Dutta (Uday Tikekar) appoints a neutral officer to handle Aakruti's case, as well as Simmba's controversial encounter.
Enraged, Durva and his goons capture Simmba. Suddenly DCP Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn) comes to his rescue, and both of them beat up Durva and his men. Singham tells Simmba that he is the neutral officer appointed by the state committee to handle his case and gives a statement that Simmba killed Sadashiv and Gaurav in the act of self-defence. He also calls Durva's mother and wife, who each give a statement that it was Sadashiv and Gaurav who raped Aakruti and that the brothers ran a drug racket and several other criminal activities. As a result of these crimes, Durva is sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment by the court. Singham reveals that he helped Simmba despite being against his corrupt actions, so that he could instill a fear of law in the minds of men who do not respect women.
As Singham leaves Miramar Police Station, he is talking to DCP Veer Sooryavanshi (Akshay Kumar). Singham congratulates him on his new post as ATS chief, and Sooryavanshi tells him that he will meet him soon.
Production.
It is a remake of the Telugu-language film "Temper" (2015). Shetty said, "We wanted to take four-five scenes from Temper but... thought it's better to buy the rights". The film has an estimated production budget of .
Principal photography for "Simmba" began in June 2018. It was mainly filmed in Goa and Kolhapur, with some filming in Hyderabad and extra sequences filmed at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai.
On 29 June 2018, the crew filmed the song, "Simmba Aala Re Aala Simmba Aala", at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. On Instagram, Singh noted the large scale of the production and said that it was the biggest song of his career.
Legal issues surrounding the production of Khan's debut-film "Kedarnath" interfered with the production of "Simmba". Khan was scheduled to shoot for both films around the same time. A lawsuit shut down the production of "Kedarnath" and Khan allotted the time to work on "Simmba". "Kedarnath's" director, Abhishek Kapoor, sued Khan because his film would be delayed and it would no longer mark the debut of Khan. The two settled out of court when Khan agreed to split her time between both films.
In October 2018, lead actors Singh and Khan left for Switzerland to film a song sequence for the film. By late October, the crew had returned to Mumbai to film a second song, "Aankh Marey"—a remake of a 90s classic song.
Because Singh was to be married in November 2018, Shetty shot most of the major sequences before the wedding date. Only the final sequence was left to be filmed after the wedding. A double for Singh was used to complete patch work of a dhaba fight scene in Goa; various camera angles were used so that the double would resemble Singh.
The film wrapped shooting in early December 2018.
Soundtrack.
The songs are composed by Tanishk Bagchi, Lijo George - DJ Chetas and S. Thaman while the lyrics are written by Shabbir Ahmed, Rashmi Virag, Kumaar and Kunaal Vermaa. The soundtrack album was released on 27 December 2018.
The song "Aankh Maarey" is a remake of the song "Aankh Maare" from the 1996 film "Tere Mere Sapne", originally composed by Viju Shah and written by Anand Bakshi, sung by Kumar Sanu and Kavita Krishnamurthy, and picturised on Arshad Warsi and Simran; Warsi makes a cameo appearance in the "Simmba" version's music video, with Sanu's voice. The song was remade for the film, with the music reproduced by Tanishk Bagchi, S. Thaman and Chandan Saxena. The song "Tere Bin" is a recreation of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's 1996 qawwali song "Tere Bin Nahin Lagda". This is the second time the song is being recreated after 1999's film Kachche Dhaage which was titled "Tere Bin Nahin Jeena" sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The remake is sung by his nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan with Asees Kaur.

It is sung by Kumar Sanu (who also sung the original with Kavita Krishnamurthy), Mika Singh, and Neha Kakkar. Actor Arshad Warsi, whose film and song debut was with the original, appeared again in the video for the "Simmba" remake, along with several actors from another film from director Rohit Shetty, "Golmaal": Kunal Khemu, Shreyas Talpade, and Tusshar Kapoor.

Reception.
Critical response.
Ambica Schin of "Khaleej Times" gave the film four stars out of five and sums up, "If you are on the lookout for a totally masala, paisa vasool movie to end the year with a bang, we recommend you watch "Simmba". The melodramatic, over-the-top film is sure to leave you on a high". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama declared it a "winner" with four stars out of five, writing, "Rohit borrows the essence from "Temper", but modifies a major chunk of that film... What eventually unfolds on screen is so different, in a positive way". Anwesha Madhukalya of "Business Today" wrote, "It is indeed time to rejoice for the young star's fans for Simmba has announced the arrival of Ranveer Singh in the big league".
Writing for "The Times of India", Ronak Kotecha rated it three and a half stars out of five, terming the film as "a potboiler that you expect it to be, where the good surely outweighs the bad". Suparno Sarkar of "International Business Times" also gave it three and a half stars out of five, writing, ""Simmba" is a complete masala entertainer that is loaded with good dialogues, humour, heart-felt emotion and high-octane action. It lacks logic at various levels, but never ceases to entertain". A critic for "The Economic Times" agreed, also rating it three and a half stars out of five, but felt that "[t]he film takes a preachy turn in the second half and the narrative gets predictable".
Writing for "Hindustan Times", Raja Sen rated the film three stars out of five, writing, "[A]s it stands, "Simmba" is not only ahead of "Singham", but far superior to "Dabangg", the blockbuster that defines the genre". He appreciated Singh for the energy he brought to the role, but found Khan was restricted by her role. Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave the film two and a half stars out of five, finding the first half to be "a sporadically enjoyable comedy", but found the second half to be "less enjoying": "The film leaves a lot to be desired, but a star is re-born". Uday Bhatia of "Mint" concurred with Masand: but credited Singh for playing his "cardboard creation" of a character with an "underlying sweetness that renders it more winsome than the humourless masculinity of Devgan's Singham".

<doc id="56890763" url="?curid=56890763" title="TCG Atılay">
TCG Atılay

TCG "Atılay" was a submarine of the Turkish Navy, which sank on 14 July 1942. Its wreck was located after more than 50 years.
She was built at Germaniawerft, Kiel, being launched in 1938. Her name was chosen as "Atılay" personally by a written decree of the founder of the modern Turkey President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938). Her sister submarines were named "Saldıray", "Batıray" and "Yıldıray". She was commissioned on 19 May 1939. The submarine was long and her full crew was 52.
Sinking.
On 14 July 1942, "Atılay" was tasked by the Fleet Command to conduct testing on underwater magnetic security lines in the Dardanelles Strait. Carrying 38 crew, she was commanded by LCdr Sadi Gürcan.
The vessel came to Çanakkale and moored around 7:30 hours local time. After a briefing held between 8:00 and 9:00, she dived in Morto Bay at 14:30 to leave the Strait, accompanied by a security boat on the surface. However, due to bad weather conditions, the escort boat soon lost its contact with the submarine. As the submarine did not return in due time, two navy boats were sent for search and rescue operation. At 20:30, the submarine's rescue buoy was found. The emergency station of the navy was, however, unable to establish a telephone contact with the submarine although the telephone in the rescue buoy was intact. A seaman named Ahmet Bağdat, who had disembarked for crew rations, was the only one to survive the disaster. The fate of the submarine remained unknown for years.
Aftermath.
In 1994 after more than 50 years, Selçuk Kolay, with the support of the "Rahmi M. Koç Foundation for Museum Studies and Culture", found in a two-and-half-month research the exact location of the wreck of "Atılay". She was offshore and was lying at a depth of . A hole in the hull proved that she hit a naval mine. It is assumed that the mine was a World War I munition, which was laid during the Dardanelles Campaign.
A crew member, Warrant officer Fethi Yüceses, was the husband of Hamiyet Yüceses, a well-known Turkish singer. After the 14 July event, she released a song "Gitti de Gelmeyiverdi" ("He Went and Didn't Return"), which became a popular song of the time.
Museum project.
In the general congress of Chambers of Shipping a project was proposed by the architect Kaya Şener. According to this project the submarine will be relocated in 30 meters depth and a museum will be established in the submarine. So far the project is not realised.

Hank lives at the Pink Motel and works as a guard at the high school. He enjoys fishing and raising his tortoises. He occasionally sees a vision of a man in an orange prison jumpsuit.
One day a pretty teenage girl named Josie asks for help moving into the motel. She starts class at the school where Hank works and is assigned a project where students are to work in pairs. She makes friends with Marcus and they agree to work together, to the dismay of Marcus' best friend Gator. Marcus and Josie spend time together, and not just on school work. 
Hank is friends with Josie, but because of the age difference, neighbor Martha criticizes his relationship. But Hank does not seem to think of Josie in that way. He and Marcus do not get along, partly because Hank harasses Marcus and his friends at school. 
One day while they are together, Hank tells Josie his story. He was a guard at the Huntsville, Texas prison, where he was one of those who tied down prisoners about to be executed. Years later, one of the inmates was found innocent, and this haunted him to the point where he had to quit his job and move elsewhere.
Josie wants Hank and Marcus to get along, so she invites them to come together and talk out their differences and drink. As Hank talks about fishing, Marcus says he likes to hunt, and he pulls out a knife that he uses. Hank passes out and remembers the day the prisoner of his visions was executed. Watching the event is a little girl.
When Hank wakes up he is tied up. Josie explains she was that little girl and her father was innocent and she wants revenge. It does not matter that Hank feels remorse. She cuts his throat. The cops show up, and Hank as narrator says Marcus was framed for Hank's murder.
Josie has different hair as she travels to Huntsville. She meets one of the prison guards in a bar.
Production.
Anthony Magnone II's original script for the film, then titled "Huntsville", was voted to the 2014 Black List, a list of the year's most popular unproduced screenplays. During the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2015, the Coalition Group announced the beginning of development for the film with the casting of Shea Whigham as Hank and Anya Taylor-Joy as Josie. By August 2016, Whigham and Taylor-Joy had been replaced with Dylan McDermott and Sophie Turner, respectively, and Jack Kilmer was also added to the cast. Filming began that same month in Los Angeles. The film's title was changed from "Huntsville" to "Josie" ahead of its premiere at the Mammoth Film Festival. The film's North American distribution rights were acquired by Screen Media Films in January 2018, also ahead of its premiere, with international distribution being acquired by Lightning Entertainment.
Release.

Critical response.

Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "At various moments throughout the movie, Turner and McDermott suggest something far more complicated and messy than the noir-tinged exercise that unfolds."
Nick Schager of "Variety Magazine" criticizes the film, writing that it: "spends so much time trying to resemble a film noir that its refusal to engage in actual film noir business proves downright exasperating, a situation compounded by the eventual revelations it has in store."

Fyning Hill

Fyning Hill is a large estate near the village of Rogate in West Sussex. It has been owned by several prominent people.
The main house contains 8 bedrooms with 5 reception rooms. It was owned by Sir Albert Braithwaite until his death in 1959. The estate was owned in the 1970s and 1980s by the Jordanian businessman Taj Hajjar, who was a friend of King Hussein of Jordan. The biggest ever robbery in Sussex occurred on the property in May 1983 when £800,000 of jewellery was stolen. Hajjar put up an £80,000 reward, but no thief was ever apprehended.
Hajjar sold the estate to the Australian publisher and broadcaster Kerry Packer for $5 million in May 1989. Packer built the headquarters for his polo team at Fyning Hill, and would arrive at the estate in May for the three-month English polo season. Packer subsequently bought the nearby Great House Farm for £580,000 in June 1989, and had acquired 600 acres of nearby countryside by June 1990. Packer's daughter, Gretel, was married on the estate in 1991. The estate totaled 424 acres with five houses and nine cottages by September 1999 when Packer put the estate up for sale. The estate was bought by the Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in 1999 for £12 million.
The estate was included as part of the divorce settlement between Abramovich and his second wife. The size of the estate was listed as 420 acres in 2017.

Sir James Milles Riddell, 2nd Baronet

Sir James Milles Riddell (sometimes shown as James Milne Riddell) FRSE DCL, 2nd Baronet of Ardnamurchan and Sunart (1787–1861) was a 19th-century Scottish landowner and agricultural improver.
Life.
He was born on 3 June 1787 the son of Thomas Riddell, and his wife, Margaretta Campbell. His grandfather Sir James Riddell, 1st Baronet of Ardnamurchan and Sunart outlived his father Thomas, and on James' death in 1797 James Milles Riddell became 2nd baronet at the age of ten.
They lived at the family estate of Strontian in Argyleshire where in 1791 Thomas Charles Hope first discovered strontium (originally called stronianite, in recognition of its finding place).
He studied at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1820 he had a townhouse in Edinburgh's Second New Town at 30 Abercromby Place.
In 1821 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Thomas Charles Hope.
In 1828 the clachans (tied villages) of Bourblaige and Tornamona were, on the instructions of Sir James Milles Riddell, brutally cleared. "In one case a half-witted woman was locked in her cottage, the door being barricaded on the outside by mason-work. ... The laird's men shot the dogs, shot the goats, drove away the cows, then they took the roofs off. It was in the wintertime that they did it. Ploughs were put through the potato pits so that they would spoil in the frost."
He died in Edinburgh on 28 September 1861 and is buried in St John's Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street. The grave lies in the north-west corner of the enclosure attached to the east end of the church.
Family.
In 1822 he married Mary Brooke, daughter of Sir Richard Brooke, 5th Baronet.
They had one daughter, Mary Augusta Riddell (died 1879).
On his death the baronetcy passed to Thomas Miles Riddell, a cousin.

Errol Parish Church

Errol Parish Church is a listed church in the Scottish village of Errol, Perth and Kinross. It has the informal names of North Church and the Cathedral of the Carse.
History.
The Parish of Errol has some of the oldest records in Scotland. A church in the locality is recorded in the early 13th Century. Little is known of the characteristics of the Medieval building. It was demolished and rebuilt in 1765, although a sketch produced during its early life shows a large traceried window built into a small annex on one of its walls, suggesting the reuse of at least some of the old materials. In the early 19th Century, it was decided that the church again needed to be rebuilt. A site was donated in 1830 by John Lee Allen of Errol Park. The donated ground was 120 metres to the NNE of the former location. The church was designed by James Gillespie Graham and was officially opened on 17 March 1833. The builder of the church, one George Page, charged only £3819 for his services, a very low sum, and subsequently went bankrupt as a result. The church's predecessor was later demolished, although its graveyard still exists.
The church's clock was installed in 1902 in memory of Reverend Robert Graham, who served as the church's minister for 42 years. The church's bells were restored at the same time. The organ and communion table were provided by another bequest in 1905, and in 1915–16, Lady Ogilvie Dalgleish paid for new flooring, the installation of heating and gas lighting, a pulpit and chairs for the priests and elders. Electricity was installed in 1934 at the expense of Mr William Watson of Scone. The silver font dates from 1778 and was removed from the 1765 church. The church has been a category A listed building since 1971, its boundary walls and gatepiers being included in the citation.
In July 2017, objections were made concerning the church's bells, which an anonymous complainant claimed were too loud. On the village's social media page, over 400 people posted their support for the continued striking of the bells, and the complaint was later withdrawn.
Organisation.
The church is in the Presbytery of Perth. Since , the church has been linked with Kilspindie &amp; Rait Parish Church.

Brass plate company

A brass plate company or brass plate trust is a legally constituted company lacking meaningful connection with the location of incorporation. The name is based on a company whose only tangible existence in its jurisdiction of incorporation is the nameplate attached to the wall outside its registered office. The registered office is often the same office and address of the local professional service firm(s) or corporate service provider(s) (CSPs), (i.e. legal, accounting or secretarial etc.) who act as local support to the company. Brass plate structures are associated with tax havens, corporate tax havens, and offshore financial centres.
Definitions.
In the landmark "Inspire Art" ruling, the ECJ defined a brass plate company (in an EU context) as being a ".. company (formed under the laws of a member state) which lacks any real connection with the State of formation ...". The ECJ ruled that, with certain caveats, brass plate companies were legitimate in the EU. The ECJ previously used the term "letterbox company", in the landmark Centros ruling, in relation to companies using various EU incorporation locations (in a brass plate fashion) to avoid unfavorable local regulations in their home EU location, in conducting their business.
While legally similar (if not identical), the term letterbox company is usually used if the company legally trades with the general public (as per the Centros case) from its location (i.e. appears as the legal address in a catalogue marketing firm), while all other types are called brass plate companies (i.e. private investment firms).
Neither brass plate companies nor letterbox companies should be confused with shell companies. Shell companies can be incorporated in the full "home base" of the main parent company (they don't have to be located in an unconnected foreign location); their key feature is that they have no assets (other than cash, as used in some definitions). A company can be a brass plate shell company (foreign base, no assets), or just a brass plate company (foreign base, many assets), or just a shell company (home base, no assets).
In practice, it is very common for a brass plate companies not to be shell companies; however, many shell companies are often brass plate companies. This is because a very common driver of creating a shell company is often to legally move a business activity to a different location from the "home base".
Etymology.
"Brass plate company" refers to the company's perhaps only tangible existence in its jurisdiction of incorporation: the nameplate (historically, often made of brass) attached to the wall outside the company's registered office.
Controls.
While accepted in the EU (from above ECJ rulings), the term brass plate company has become most commonly associated with offshore tax havens (i.e. Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands etc.) Thus the term brass plate company is often used in the pejorative sense (especially in the media) and associated with undesirable nefarious activities (i.e. tax evasion, money laundering or arms trafficking etc.).
Because of this, more reputable "onshore" financial centres (i.e. Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands), who enjoy access to major global tax treaties, generally steer clear of any implication that they are open to brass plate companies for fear of being labelled corporate tax havens, and therefore losing access to the global tax treaty networks.
Regulators in these onshore financial centres control the spread of brass plate companies by enforcing stronger tax residency rules that require greater "commercial substance" to occur in the regulator's jurisdiction (also known as the "central management and control" test in UK case law). Typical criteria used include:
There is a level of scepticism over whether such controls are really effective in controlling brass plate companies. The registered office is often the same office and address of the local professional service firm(s) or corporate service provider(s) (CSPs), (i.e. legal, accounting or secretarial etc.) who act as local support to the company. It is not uncommon for CSPs to have hundreds of brass plate companies legally registered at their office. CSPs in onshore financial centres are capable of providing local directors, administration and other services designed to meet the minimum "central management and control test" for moderate fees. A recent academic study into Irish Section 110 SPVs found individual CSP officers acting as "local directors" for hundreds of SPVs, and found little evidence of any substance to the "central management and control" test.
Examples.
Notable examples of entities accused of using brass plate structures for unsavoury activities include (notice the term "brass plate" being used by the media in the attached references):

Nature so loved this village that it gave a river, lake, green pastures and lovely people. Five hundred years ago it is believed that the current residents of Ramanatham migrated from Vaagaiyur and from Thinniyam, near Trichy, hence they are referred as Devan Thinnyam Vahariaa.
Cricket and badminton are famous sports and tournaments have been conducted for decades.
The higher secondary school boasts a different variety of trees. Nearby is a Chivan (Sivan) temple with inscriptions of Chola dynasty.

Sarah P. Monks

Sarah Preston Monks (1841–1926) was an American naturalist, educator, scientific illustrator, and poet, based for much of her career in San Pedro, California. Monks was the first zoology instructor at Los Angeles State Normal School, a precursor to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she taught for over 20 years, and published on diverse topics including reptiles, amphibians, spiders, and marine biology.
Early life and education.
Sarah Preston Monks was born in Cold Spring, New York, the daughter of John Monks and Sarah Charlotte Monks (née Jolly). Her brother John A. S. Monks became a noted New England artist and her sister Mary E. Monks lived in Massachusetts. She studied at Vassar College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1871 and a master's degree in 1876. She read one of her own poems, "Waiting for the Tide", at Vassar's 1871 graduation ceremony. She pursued further technical training at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania.
Career.
While still in Philadelphia, she worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences, classifying ornithological specimens. She later moved to California, where she taught for one year at the College of Santa Barbara before joining the faculty of the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1884 where she became the school's first instructor of zoology. She taught zoology, chemistry and drawing at the Normal School until her retirement in 1906 and was curator of the school's museum. She also lectured on entomology and microscopy at the school's Teachers' Institutes (continuing education programs for teachers in Southern California). Meanwhile, she worked on research projects in her own time, and in collaboration with the William Emerson Ritter's laboratory on Terminal Island. She collected specimens and published scientific and popular articles on turtles, lizards, salamanders, spiders, shipworms, and diatoms. She also published poetry. In her seventies, she consulted on topics including marine biology, entomology, botany, and geology from her cottage and garden in San Pedro. "I am pleasing myself as I please," she explained of her unconventional interests. "I have been bossed all my life."
Publications by Monks included the textbook "Anatomy Physiology Hygiene" (though she was not credited as author of this text, only as illustrator), "A Partial Biography of the Green Lizard" ("The American Naturalist", 1881), "Regeneration of the Body of a Starfish" ("Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia", 1903), "Variability and Autotomy of Phataria" ("Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia" 1904). She was listed as a member of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in 1888, and in 1894 as a founding member of the laboratory's Biological Association. The snail "Fusinus monksae" is believed to have been named for her.
Personal life.
Monks had a cottage named "Phataria" on Sea Pansy Bay in the Los Angeles Harbor, next door to the cottage of her friend, Charles Fletcher Lummis. She donated her library of scientific publications and other materials to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in 1915. She died in San Pedro on July 10, 1926, aged 85 years.

Balasore Roads

Balasore Roads is a roadstead (a sheltered anchorage), on the Indian coast near Balasore. It was the location of the Bengal Pilot Service pilot boarding station (see chart). It was considered to be a generally safe anchorage, with depths varying from 5 to 15 fathoms, and with the sea bottom consisting of mud and sand.
The entrance to the Hooghly River was considered to be the most difficult of any river in India, and the river pilot station was located in close proximity to the mouth of the river.
During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars French privateer captains such as Jean-François Hodoul and Robert Surcouf would cruise the mouth of the Hooghly River hoping to capture vessels anchored in the Roads, or proceeding to or from Calcutta. The French captured both pilot vessels such as , and large East Indiamen such as .

Kevin Kühnert

Kevin Kühnert (born 1 July 1989) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).
From 24 November 2017 to 8 January 2021 he was the federal chairman of the Jusos. Previously, he served as deputy chairman.
Early life and career.
Kühnert was born in West Berlin. His father is a tax clerk, and his mother works in a job centre. He was named after the footballer Kevin Keegan. He passed his final exam at the Beethoven-Gymnasium in Lankwitz in 2008, where he also served as pupil's spokesman. He then completed a voluntary social year (German: "Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr") in a Berlin-based organization for children and young people.
Kühnert initially worked over three years in a call center, then studying journalism and communication science at the Free University of Berlin, but never graduated. In 2016, he enrolled for a degree in political science at the University of Hagen, but suspended studies after becoming Juso chairman. In 2014, he began working in the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin, first for Dilek Kolat, then Melanie Kühnemann.
Political career.
Kühnert joined the SPD in 2005 and chaired the Jusos in Berlin from 2012 to 2015. Since 2015, he acted as deputy Jusos Federal Chairman and was responsible for tax policy, pension policy, structural policy, right-wing extremism, and migration policy, as well as social media work. When Johanna Uekermann did not run as a candidate again, in November 2017, the Juso federal congress in Saarbrücken elected Kühnert as chairman, with 225 of 297 votes. In terms of local politics, Kühnert is active in the district of Tempelhof-Schöneberg as a member of the district council.
During the campaign for the SPD party member vote on the 2018 coalition agreement of Germany, Kühnert, along with the #NoGroKo (No Grand Coalition) initiative, promoted the No campaign. At a SPD national convention in 2019, he was elected as one of the five deputies of the party’s co-chairs Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, alongside Klara Geywitz, Hubertus Heil, Serpil Midyatli and Anke Rehlinger. He had previously endorsed Esken and Walter-Borjans in their successful bid for the leadership of the party in 2019.
In an August 2020 interview with "Der Tagesspiegel" Kühnert announced that he would step down as chair of the Jusos, saying that the "time was right" for new leadership in advance of an anticipated 2021 German federal election. After Kühnert resigned from the office early because of his candidacy for the Bundestag, Jessica Rosenthal was elected to succeed him on 8 January 2021, with 207 of 266 votes. On 16 December 2020, he was nominated as a direct candidate in the Berlin constituency of Tempelhof-Schöneberg in the 2021 federal election.
Political positions.
In an interview with German newspaper "Die Zeit" in May 2019, Kühnert described himself as being a democratic socialist, promoting the communisation of large firms and the expropriation of owners from companies like BMW and people who own more than one house or apartment. In his opinion, real democratic socialism has never been tried.
Recognition.
In May 2018, Kühnert was chosen as a "Next Generation Leader" by "Time" because of the resistance he launched against the grand coalition that nearly managed to topple Chancellor Angela Merkel and led to a national debate about the future of the SPD and the future of German politics in general. In August 2020 he was described as "a rising star on the left" in Germany by "The Guardian".
Personal life.
In March 2018, Kühnert came out as gay in an interview with the magazine "Siegessäule".

Tomb of Munmu of Silla

Tomb of Munmu of Silla is an underwater tomb, the 30th king of Silla, in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. This is Historic Site No. 158, also known as Daewang-am.
Location.
The tomb of Munmu of Silla is located in 26, Bonggil-ri, Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. It is located 200 meters off the coast of Bonggil-ri in Yangbuk-myeon. 
Appearance.
It is the only underwater tomb in the world. It looks like normal rocks from a distance. There is a smaller rock to the south. The area is surrounded by small rocks that are only seen at low tide intervals, making them look like stone beams. It is owned by the Gyeongju National Museum. The monument collapsed early, and two large sections and one small stone were discovered so far, but one stone is not handed over. The stone is a reddish-brown igneous rock with a maximum height of 52cm, 64cm wide and 24cm thick, and the small section is carved with a 2-legged triangle.' 
Underwater tomb.
The tomb of Munmu of Silla is located on the sea. To see the tomb, one must go to a rare and mysterious tomb built between small rocks in the middle of the sea. Although the tomb of Munmu of Silla looks like a small rocky island from a distance, it is located on the rock, and it is like a pond in the middle. The rock is built at regular intervals like a pillar, and a large building looks like a turtle. Water flows in and out of the pond in all directions, as the waters that flow in and out of the lake slowly turn around and out to the west. It is believed that the Silla people artificially refined the royal tomb of Munmu of Silla. 
History.
Silla Dynasty.
Munmu of Silla' unified the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but he was worried about the safety of unstable countries and the invasion of Japan. When Japan broke out on the East Sea and killed and pillaged the people, 'Munmu of Silla' began to build temples while increasing military and defense facilities on the east coast. The idea was to defeat the Japanese people with the help of Buddha. But before the temple was finished, 'Munmu of Silla' became ill. 'Munmu of Silla' called his son before his death. "If I die, Bury me in Donghae (Sea of Japan). So when he died, but left a will to the of his body be cremated in accordance with Buddhist ceremony to bury the ashes the Sea of Japan. It is called , and it is the Tomb of Munmu of Silla. In this way, 'Munmu of Silla' will become a great dragon and protect the country. His remains from the land in accordance with Munmu of Silla's will be cremated and the Sea of Japan of with and frugal lifestyle he paid funeral. When 'Munmu of Silla' died before completing the temple, his son King Sinmun completed it in 682. And he named it " " to thank 'Munmu of Silla's grace. 
Cho geung-seop(조긍섭), who toured Gyeongju from 1918 to 1926 during Korea under Japanese rule, wrote a poem using the tomb of Munmu of Silla. In his poem, Munmu of Silla instructed him to cremate in the Sea of Japan with dying words. People suspected he might have designated such a big tomb. However, people guess that the cremate might have caused him to bury his bones and become a big tomb. He will not get a place like this without great virtue. 
A tale of Manpasikjeok.
Sinmun of Silla built for his father, Munmu of Silla. In 682, a public official said 'Small mountain in Donghae is coming to Gameunsa'. According to the fortune-telling, King Munmu of Silla, who became the dragon of the sea, and Gim Yu-sin, who became the king of heaven, said, " Go out and take the present." When he came and saw at , it looked like a turtle's head and had bamboo on it, divided into two by day and combined into one by night. Nine days after the storm, the king entered the mountain and the dragon said, "If you made a flute out of that bamboo, the whole world would be at ease." So he took it out, made a flute and kept it. The name of this flute is Manpasikjeok. The reason for the name is that when the country is worried, he played the flute and country has become quiet. 
Tombstone.
Unlike most royal tombs, Munmu of Silla's tombstone could not be placed in front of them. He was buried in rocks of the Donghae. It is assumed that Munmu of Silla's tombstone was built at Sacheonwang Temple, a place that was closely related to Munmu of Silla's life. Based on the excavation research, the two royal tombs are believed to be Sacheonwang Temple Historical Hall and Munmu of Silla's Royal Palace. Sacheonwang Temple also appears on the side of Gyeongmyeong of Silla of Samguk sagi, which appears to have been maintained until silla collapsed.
However, with the fall of Silla, Munmu of Silla's tombstone has become unknown. However, the existence was confirmed by Hong Yang-ho, then a member of the Gyeongju Buyun, in 1760, and was reconfirmed by Chusa Gim Jeong-hui, who visited Gyeongju in 1817. The lower part of tombstone was discovered in 1961, and the higher part of tombstone was discovered by a gas inspector when it was used as a laundry stone in a house in eastern Gyeongju in 2009.

Friedberg–Mücke railway

The Friedberg–Mücke railway is a railway that was opened in 1890/97 in the Wetterau and Vogelsberg regions in the German state of Hesse. Sections of the line are also called the "Horlofftalbahn" (Horloff Valley Railway) and the Seentalbahn (Seen Valley Railway). It originally connected three major railways that run from Giessen, namely:
Today only the eleven kilometre-long section to Wölfersheim operates as a feeder line to the regional node of Friedberg, where it connects to the rest of the railway network and, importantly for commuters from the Wetterau, Frankfurt.
The Beienheim–Schotten railway, also called the "Horlofftalbahn", which branches off in Beienheim to Nidda, opened on the same day and is still operating.
Sections.
The line is divided into four sections and a branch line:
For the Friedberg–Beienheim–Nidda–Schotten line, which was built at the same time, see the Beienheim–Schotten railway article.
History.
The line was originally planned and operated by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways ("Großherzoglich Hessische Staatseisenbahnen"), which was later merged into the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company ("Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft"). The Hungen–Laubach section was opened on 1 June 1890 and the Friedberg–Hungen section was opened on 1 October 1897. The whole line could be operated from 1 November 1903.
From 1936, the line was to be upgraded to two tracks as a main line. This did not happen, however, because of the outbreak of war. A second tunnel with a length of 196 metres had already been built in the immediate vicinity of the existing Freienseen Tunnel (146 metres).
In 1968, the line between Inheiden and Berstadt-Wohnbach had to be relocated to allow lignite mining. This also caused Obbornhofen-Bellersheim station to be relocated on 9 June 1968. The old line is now dismantled, but still recognisable from the air.
Villingen–Ruppertsburg–Friedrichshütte branch line.
The branch line to Ruppertsburg was initially built by the Grand Duchy of Hesse State Railways from Villingen (Oberhessen) station as a narrow gauge horse-hauled line to the Friedrichshütte iron foundry and later rebuilt under Prussian direction as standard gauge. This conversion went into operation on 1 April 1896. The line was used for the carriage of freight and employees for the Friedrichshütte foundry, but it never used for public transport. The branch line was closed in 1959.
Route.
The route is now only in operation from Friedberg to Wölfersheim-Södel. The trains continued to Hungen until 2003 and to Mücke via the Vogelsberg until 1958/59. It was possible to transfer to the line to Nidda in Beienheim.
Originally, the tracks of Laubach station were on the eastern side of the road. When the line was extended to Mücke the track infrastructure was relocated to the other side of the station and only a loading track was preserved on the eastern side of the road. The station had a two-story entrance building with a goods shed as an annex. The station building is currently (as of 2011) used by a youth centre.
Operations.
The line is in the area of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association, RMV). Until the 2004/2005 timetable change, public transport services on the two branches of the line were operated by the Butzbach-Lich Railway Company; since the 2005/2006 timetable change services have been operated by Hessische Landesbahn, its parent company. In the peak hour, trains on the line run to and from Friedberg. In the 2012 timetable, seven train pairs a day ran between Beienheim and Wölfersheim-Södel and nine train pairs between Friedberg and Wölfersheim-Södel from Monday to Friday.
There are hardly any freight operations left.
Prospects.
There are plans to reactivate the decommissioned Wölfersheim-Hungen section. The tracks are complete and apart from minor weathering still in relatively good condition. Despite the blockage of the line at the termini, the signal technology was still in operation; for example, the Wölfersheim semaphore signals were still actively lit until Wölfersheim was rebuilt into a halt in 2008. Nevertheless, at many of the already neglected level crossings, the safety technology and tracks would have to be fundamentally renewed or relocated.

Lordotus pulchrissimus

Lordotus pulchrissimus is a species of bee fly in the taxonomic order Diptera and family Bombyliidae. It is also frequently referred to as the desert bee fly. Few studies have been done on the biology of "L. pulchrissimus", although their behavior in the wild has been observed.
The primary food of desert bee flies is rabbitbrush, a flowering desert plant. The flies feed on its nectar and also aid in its pollination.
A trademark of "L. pulchrissimus" is the daily tendency of males to form large aerial swarm for reasons that are currently unknown. Aside from two studies on this male aggregation behavior, the other behaviors of "L. pulchrissimus" are less studied"."
Description.
Physical.
"Lordotus pulchrissimus" has a signature coat of yellowish fur, clear wings, and large brown eyes. The fly also has a notable proboscis, which is used for collecting nectar from flowering desert brush. Both sexes of "L. pulchrissimus" are hairy, which distinguishes them from the bare but otherwise very similar species, "L. luteolus." "L. pulchrissimus" is a relatively large bee fly compared to other flies in its family. The males and females are distinct in appearance, which caused them to be misidentified as different species in the past.
Male appearance.
Male "L. pulchrissimus" have been found to range from 8-16 millimeters in length. They have considerably less fur than the females in addition to larger wingspans. The males' fur typically ranges from yellow to brown in color. They have characteristic black markings on much of their femora.
Female appearance.
Female "L. pulchrissimus" have been found to range from 2-14 millimeters in length. Females typically have more dense fur than males in addition to brighter shades of orange and yellow fur.
An interesting aspect of female "L. pulchrissimus" is the color change of their fur. Not only does the fur coat of females age more rapidly than males as they age, the color of their fur when the female is alive fades more quickly than when they are dead. This feature of female's fur was used as a study's metric in determining their age in study, as the females' fur tends to fade at similar rates.
Behavioral.
"Lordotus pulchrissimus"' activity distributions are notably different from other flies who have ecologically similar requirements and live in similar habitats. They engage in feeding, as well as more aggressive behavior, primarily in the morning time and for very lengthy periods of time. In comparison, most other flies inhabit similar climates and intersperse these energy-costly activities with resting periods throughout the day. This behavior in most flies is more energy efficient than the activity budgeting of "L. pulchrissimus", which starts expending energy at the beginning of the day.
Male aggregation.
Observations of male L. "pulchrissimus" demonstrate the different activity budgeting, who allocate more of their time to energetically costly activities than almost any other species of fly; they spend a majority of their time doing energy-costly activities like engaging in continuous hover flight and lengthy aerial aggregations. While males typically forage somewhat less than females, they use their extra time for more aggregation rather than more rest. Although this behavior could be described as lekking, not enough is known about it to determine the underlying causes.
The most notable behavior pattern that male "L. pulchrissimus" exhibit is their daily aggregation into aerial swarms on stabilized dunes. This behavior has been primarily studied on the north shore of Mono Lake in California. Although on a given day, males typically arrive first to the swarm area and begin interacting before females arrive, the pattern of male aggregation in "L. pulchrissimus" is especially distinct as this type of male aggregation typically has more costs than benefits. In most other cases where males aggregate, it occurs as a result of female aggregation, but this is not the case for "L. pulchrissimus". The aggregation typically occurs over areas of relatively sparse rabbitbrush, showing that the male aggregation is also unrelated to obtaining resources. Most cases of male aggregation occur in concordance with female aggregation and/or resource density, but neither is the case for "L. pulchrissimus."
Distribution.
"Lordotus pulchrissimus" have been documented in different desert locations throughout southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This includes multiple sites where they have been studied in the wild in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Not much precise information is known about their overall distribution other than what is mentioned about their presence at specific test sites.
On average, males emerge first before females. Both sexes emerge over a relatively long proportion of the season.
Habitat.
"Lordotus pulchrissimus" primarily live in arid deserts including the Sonoran Desert and the Mojave Desert. They typically occupy regions of the deserts where they can find brush, their primary source of food. They have also been found to inhabit more temperate regions, including Mono Lake, CA, where multiple studies on the species have been performed.
Home range and territoriality.
Home range.
"L. pulchrissimus" typically stay within a few hundred square meters of sites of male aggregation, unique because males tend to avoid areas of high resource density when aggregating. The males tend to occupy areas very close to their aggregation sites. The home range of females, however, has not been researched, as their recapture in most studies was relatively unsuccessful compared to males. The females tend to migrate away approximately 70 meters each day, and are not guaranteed to return to the spot they were at the previous day.
Territoriality.
Conversely to other species of fly in their areas of inhabitance, "L. pulchrissimus" males do not typically express territoriality over a single brush bush. "L. pulchrissimus" males, instead, spend approximately 1.5 hours each day aggregating about 20 meters in the air above areas of brush. However, during these aggregations, the males vigorously defend their territory and engage in aggressive behavior while in their aggregation clouds.
Population structure.
The population density of female "L. pulchrissimus" is higher than the population density of male "L. pulchrissimus." Males typically are found at a population density of 2-5 males per hectare. For females, the distribution of ages is biased towards younger females as they typically leave the group after mating. Females live approximately 10–14 days. Less information is given on male population structure, as the study focused more on the presence and absence of females.
Food Resources.
Larval diet.
"L. pulchrissimus" larvae feed on the flesh and eggs of other insects. The specific insects they feed on are currently unknown.
Parasitism.
Bee fly larvae often parasitize the immature stages of other insects for sustenance. Bee fly larvae are parasitoids which take extreme advantage of their hosts, often feeding on them or their eggs.
Adult diet.
Adult "L. pulchrissimus" feed mostly on desert brush.
In one of the primary sites of "L. pulchrissimus" research in Mono Lake, CA, the adult diet consists almost entirely on "Chrysothamnus nauseosus" or rabbitbrush, a flowering perennial shrub that attracts many different types of pollinating insects. "L. pulchrissimus" allocate more of their time to feeding than is common for fly species, converse to the concept that they should be foraging-time minimizers. The reason for this is not yet researched.
Mating.
Female "L. pulchrissimus" mate within three days of their emergence into the colony in early August. Observations on their behavior suggests they mate as soon as they can and only once. They typically copulate for 5–10 minutes. "L. pulchrissimus" tends to exhibit a weak tendency towards size-assortive mating, in which females and males of similar sizes copulate. It is likely that female "L. pulchrissimus" have little choice in their mate, meaning most of the sexual dimorphism occurs as a result of intrasexual selection. 
Mutualism.
Rabbitbrush.
"L. pulchrissimus" have a mutualistic relationship with rabbitbrush. The flies feed on its nectar and pollinate the brush in the process.

Cuterebra fontinella

Cuterebra fontinella, the mouse bot fly, is a species of New World skin bot fly in the family Oestridae. "C. fontinella" is typically around in length with a black and yellow color pattern. "C. fontinella" develops by parasitizing nutrients from its host, typically the white-footed mouse. "C. fontinella" has even been known to parasitize humans in rare cases. Individuals parasitized by "C. fontinella" will develop a large bump on the skin that is indicative of parasitization. 
Etymology.
The genus name "Cuterebra" is a blend of the Latin words "cutis" : skin and "terebra" : borer. 
Distribution.
"C. fontinella" is found all around North America. "C. fontinella" has been found in most of the continental United States, Southern Canada, and Northern Mexico. The prevalence of "C. fontinella" is reliant on temperature, so colder regions will not be as densely populated as the warmer ones.
Habitat.
"C. fontinella" inhabits deciduous forests of North America. "C. fontinella" prefer territories near running water and with low-elevation vegetation. These flies are found in the highest density near the edges of their habitats.
Description.
"C. fontinella" look very similar to other species within the genus "Cuterebra" but have a few distinguishing features. The easiest indicator to use is the host species, as different species of Cuterebra infest different hosts. However, this method is not always reliable as "C. fontinella" have been known to infest multiple host species in addition to their preferred host, "Peromyscus leucopus," the white-footed mouse. "C. fontinella" eggs are typically long and 0.03 mm wide. They are shaped like canoes and have a large groove along their underside; this groove enables attachment to vegetation. "C. fontinella" larvae transition from golden brown to black during development. The larvae are oval in shape. Grown larvae are typically long, wide, and thick. The larva is segmented into 12 sections, with backwards facing conical spines on almost every segment. The head segment is shield shaped, colored white or tan, contains antennal pits and retractable mandibles. The 12th segment bears two spiracles and is also lightly colored. However, the spines on this segment are outward facing. Adult "C. fontinella" have black hair on their scutum and a black spot on their anipisterum. Adults are typically and have a close resemblance to bees.
Home range and territoriality.
"C. fontinella" flies are territorial insects. Males chase away intruding males while patrolling their territory by flying in figure-eight and oval patterns. Since females only fly when looking for a mate, the male tries to control as much high-quality territory as he can. They congregate above heat-reflecting surfaces on roadsides and near streams. These flies are very dependent on temperature; though they can live in a vast array of latitudes, the climate they live in influences their prevalence throughout the year.
Life history.
Eggs
Egg development is slowed by temperatures below and under arid atmosphere conditions. The ideal conditions for development are warm and humid, characteristic of southern climates. Stimulation from moisture and heat (often from the host passing by the egg) will cause the egg to hatch and the larva to be rubbed onto the host.
Larval instars
Once on the host, the larva enters through the nose, mouth, eyes, anus, or any open wound. Inside the body, the larva migrates and settles near the groin, then creates a “warble” with a small hole at the top layer of skin for breathing. The backward-facing spikes on the segments of the larva help to stabilize it.by preventing the larva from being pulled out of the host by gripping to the flesh surrounding it. The larva typically emerge after the host dies (typically 3.5-4 weeks), and then burrow into the ground.
Pupae
"C. fontinella" pupates in the ground and emerges as an adult. Diapause can occur during winter or other general unfavorable conditions. Pupae can remain in diapause for as long as 12 months if need be. In simulated standard settings (27°C and an alternating day and night light schedule), pupal development typically occurs in 50 days.
Adults
Adults of "C. fontinella" live a short life without feeding. Oocyte development begins as soon as females leave the pupal stage of development. Oocyte development finishes in about 5 days. Mating can occur before oocyte development is finished. No secondary egg development occurs, likely due to the short adult lifespan of "C. fontinella". Female "C. fontinella" females typically lay their eggs in vegetation, especially that located near the homes/burrows of their intended hosts. Adult females can lay up to 2000 eggs.
Parasitism.
Migration within the host.
After entering the body, the larvae follow a distinct path within the host. If entering either through the nose, mouth, or eyes, the larvae first orient themselves using the host's nasal passageway. Then they travel through the upper respiratory system, making their way to the thoracic cavity. They then proceed to the abdominal cavity and eventually to the inguinal region of the host. If the larvae enter the host through an open wound or the anus, they find the closest portion of the standard tract, then continue their journey as they normally would.
Warbles.
Once settled, the larva creates areas of swelling in the subcutaneous skin layer of their host. These swellings, known as warbles, are located between the anus and genital organs of the host. They last the same amount of time that the larva spends in its larval stage (3.5-4.0 weeks). The warble consists of a pore, a cavity, and a capsule. The pore serves as a breathing hole for the larva. As the larva grows, the size of the warble grows with it. Translucent yellow liquids are secreted from the larva. The cavity is the area of the warble where the larva lives. It expands gradually as the larva grows in size. The capsule is the tissue that surrounds the cavity. The capsule starts off as thin tissue, and thickens as larval development continues due to natural bodily healing of the host.
Effect on host.
Effect on individual.
Individuals infested with "C. fontinella" can experience anemia, leukocytosis, plasma protein imbalances, local tissue damage, and splenomegaly. Infested female hosts produce fewer and smaller litters than those that are parasite-free. Counterintuitively, infestation actually leads to an increase in survival time for the host, not a decrease in survival as one would expect. This could be caused by the change in resource allocation from reproduction to body preservation, a change that is favorable for both the host's and the "C. fontinella's" survival. Interestingly, if multiple "C. fontinella" larvae infest a host simultaneously, the host instead experiences a decrease in survival time.
Host resistance.
Resistance to infestation has been documented in hosts that have been previously infested. The resistance occurs at the entry points that have been used previously by larva, as well as the genital region of the host where the larva typically creates the warble. Nasal, oral, and anal resistance cause a decrease in infestation rate when exposed to larvae of 15-30%. No resistance from repeated ocular entry occurs. Maximum antibody production from the host occurs 28 days after infestation. The resistance causes the larvae to take abnormal alternate paths within the host. These abnormal paths caused the larvae to develop in atypical regions in the host. The insecticide Ronnel can be used to effectively stop development of larvae by preventing the larvae from boring breathing holes in the skin of the host.
Effect on population.
Infestation has varying effects on the host population's reproductive fitness, depending on the size of the habitat and the infestation rate of "C. fontinella". If the host population lives in a vast habitat with scattered areas of infestation, the reproductive rate of the host is essentially unaffected. However, in smaller habitats with higher and more uniform rates of infestation, reproductive rates can be noticeably decreased.
Food resources.
The species' host serves as the primary food source. Different species of "Cuterebra" prey on various species of rodents. However, cases of "C. fontinella" have been documented as preying on several different species of rodents. "P. leucopus" (white-footed mouse) is the favored host for "C. fontinella". Typically, 19%-33% of all "P. leucopus" are infested within a year. Other hosts for "C. fontinella" include "Lepus artemisia" ([[cottontail rabbit), "Ochrotomys nuttalli" (golden-footed mouse), P. gossypinus ([[cotton mouse), "[[Peromyscus]] maniculatus]] (deer mouse), "Liomys irroratus" ([[mexican spiny pocket mouse]]) and even very rarely humans. The highest infestation rates occur in late summer/early fall.
Mating.
Adults aggregate in open, sunny areas to find their mates. However, "C. fontinella" does not mate at temperatures below 20°C. Adult males fly 1-2 m above the ground for up to 4 hours a day in the presence of sunlight to attract a mate. Once a female demonstrates her interest, the pair finds a nearby branch or leaf for stability. The female grabs the branch or leaf and the male mounts her. The pair copulates for about 3 minutes. 
Ovipositor
The [[ovipositor]] of "C. fontinella" is unusually short relative those of the other members of the family Oestridae. Covered by dense hairs, the ovipositor resembles a [[horseshoe]], with two [[sclerite]] ends and a [[chitinous]] plate between them.
Social behavior.
Males of "C. fontinella" fly around their territories from the time at which the temperature exceeds 20°C to the early afternoon. Flight is initiated only during sunlight, but can continue during brief cloud coverage not exceeding 15 minutes. Since their flight is limited by temperature, the amount of time spent flying is dependent on the weather and temperature of the day. Females of "C. fontinella" are only seen flying when searching for a mate. Males are extremely territorial, and usually occupy a stretch of territory 17 m long, along the bank of a stream. They chase most airborne intruders that travel through their territory, regardless of their species. If two males intersect in the air, they grab onto each other and tumble to the ground. Chases persist for 10-15 minutes. "C. fontinella" tolerates a population density of up to 250 flies/km2. Fly density varies depending on weather conditions and the time of the year.
Genetic identification.
Genetic analysis can also be used to discriminate between species. COI and COII genes are reliable markers to differentiate between species. Using species specific markers, scientists can accurately identify the species of a botfly at any stage of life. In many cases larvae look ambiguous enough to be confused for another species, so genetic identification is very important. Hybridization between species within the genus "Cuterebra" has been known to occur, and can cause ambiguity within testing.
Subspecies.
The two subspecies of "C. fontinella" are "C. f. fontinella" and "C. f.a grisea" (deer mouse bot fly).
Interactions with humans.
Rare cases of "C. fontinella" host infestations have been reported, but are not the norm. In most cases, the larvae remain in relatively benign locations such as in the eye or in the subcutaneous regions within the eyelid. Occasionally, however, the larvae gain access to the tracheal-pulmonary system. Consequent symptoms in the human host include cold-like symptoms and flares of coughing. The larva are expelled from the human host when the host coughs out a bloody secretion containing the larva. 
Another species of bot fly called "Dermatobia hominis" commonly infests humans in Central and South America. Most cases of human infestation within North America are caused by the victim traveling into regions where "D. hominis" is present. As of 1989, 55 cases of [[myiasis]] caused by species within the "Cuterebra" genus have been documented. Treatment typically consists of removal of the larva and then prevention of secondary bacterial infections. If the warble is accessible, one can remove the larva by depositing petroleum jelly over the breathing hole of the parasite; this causes the larva to emerge for air and enable easier removal. Larvae within or near the eye sometimes require surgery for removal. Larvae that die within the [[vitreous humor]] of the eye do not need to be removed, they are broken down and absorbed by natural chemical processes within the host.
Conservation.
A major threat to infestation rates of "C. fontinella" is pasture burning. When soil reaches high temperatures, pupating larvae die, and ash produced during burning causes [[microclimate]] changes. These changes contribute significantly to increasing greater congregation of "C. fontinella".

Ludmilla A. Chistovich

Ludmilla A. Chistovich (1924 – 2006) was a pioneering linguist and speech scientist who co-founded the Leningrad School of Phonology, together with her husband Valery A. Kozhevnikov.
Biography.
Chistovich was born in Leningrad in 1924. She trained as a medical doctor before founding in 1960 the Laboratory of Speech Physiology at the Pavlov Institute of Physiology. She was married to Valery A. Kozhevnikov, and collaborated with him until his untimely death in 1981. They had two daughters who also became speech researchers, Elena V. Kozhevnikova and Inna A. Chistovich. After her retirement in 1986, she and her daughters established the St. Petersburg Early Intervention Institute, to foster language development in young children by providing auditory screening and programs for hearing-impaired children.
Research career and legacy.
Chistovich pioneered experimental methods for understanding the relationship between speech production and speech perception. The Pavlov Institute developed a distinctive approach to solve "the mystery of speech perception". Her work was brought to the attention of Western speech scientists by Gunnar Fant. Her work on non-linear dynamics in speech production was a major influence on the development of articulatory phonology and task dynamics, influencing researchers such as Bjorn Lindblom, Elliot Saltzman, Louis Goldstein, and Catherine Browman. She developed the method of close speech shadowing to explore the mechanisms of speech processing at very short time lags (250 to 500 msec). With Patricia K. Kuhl, she co-authored a seminal article on infant-directed speech showing that across different languages, caregivers speak to infants in a way that facilitates acquisition of the phonological system.
Publications.
A complete bibliography of Ludmilla Chistovich's publications was published as part of the special issue of Speech Communication (a joint publication of the European Association for Signal Processing (EURASIP) and the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA)) in honour of her 60th birthday. It was compiled by Christel Sorin, of the Laboratoire Psychologie de la Perception, Paris Descartes University.

The Florida Slavery Memorial is a planned site to commemorate the struggles and suffering of slaves with a memorial at the Florida Capitol in Tallahassee. Support for the planned memorial was approved by Florida's legislators and signed into law by Florida governor Rick Scott in 2018. It was sponsored by representative Kionne McGhee from Miami. Florida is also sending a statue of Mary McLeod Bethune to the U.S. Capitol. State Senator Dennis Baxley, a descendant of a Confederate soldier, had blocked a memorial bill a year earlier but supported the bill that passed in 2018. The Florida House of Representatives passed the bill unanimously. Slaves worked on Florida's 1826 territorial capitol and the 1845 capitol building, as well as many major infrastructure projects in the state. The planned monument would be the first monument at a U.S. state capitol devoted to memorializing slavery.

University of Benin Teaching Hospital

University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) is a premier and multi-specialty healthcare service provider in West Africa. The hospital is located in Ugbowo, Benin City and got established on May 12, 1973 following the enactment of an edict (number 12) of the Nigeria National Health Act.
As the sixth of the 1st generation Teaching Hospitals in Nigeria, its establishment was also to complement her sister institution, University of Benin, and to provide secondary and tertiary care to the then Mid-western Region (now Edo and Delta State) and its environs. It also provides necessary facilities for training of high and middle-level workforce for the health industry and spearheads research opportunities for lecturers in the University and other interested persons with economic morbidity burden as research question(s).
Through the Community Health Centres in Ogbona and Udo, and the General Practice Clinic that came on stream later, UBTH equally provides some avenues for primary health care to the immediate communities.
History.
The conception of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital began in 1969 with Colonel Samuel O. Ogbemudia, the then Governor of the Midwestern State of Nigeria and Prof. Tiamiyu Belo-Osagie. The desire of establishing a befitting medical centre in the Midwestern Region of Nigeria ensued after paying private visits to the Island Maternity Hospital, Lagos and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Records had it that the Governor was genuinely impressed with the facilities of these hospitals after the visits.
A few months after, an Advisory Committee for the Midwestern Medical Centre was set up with Prof. H. Oritsejolomi Thomas as Chairman. Other members of the committee were Prof. Tiamiyu Belo-Osagie, Prof. Alex Eyimofo Boyo and Mr O. I. Afe who was the Secretary to the Midwestern Military Government and Head of Service.
Within the same year, the construction of the hospital was awarded by the committee to Costain (Nigeria) Limited and was funded collaboratively by both the Government of the Midwestern Region and the Federal Government of Nigeria. Other prominent individuals who championed the actualisation of the hospital from construction to its opening were: Dr Irene E. B. Ighodaro, Prof. Glyn O. Philips, Dr A. E. Ikomi, Dr F.O. Esiri Infirmary and Mr J. O. Iluebbey.
It is noteworthy to mention, that the "Midwest Medical Centre" was renamed "University of Benin Teaching Hospital" in a budget speech by Colonel Samuel O. Ogbemudia in April 1972.
Many accolades were accorded specifically to Prof. Tiamiyu Belo-Osagie who made sacrificial efforts all through, from the hospital's conception to its completion. He was a Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, one time Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Provost, College of Medical Sciences, all of the University of Benin.
The University of Benin Teaching Hospital has contributed immensely to the preferment of medical knowledge and education across West Africa. The hospital, under the current leadership of Prof. Darlington E. Obaseki as Chief Medical Director, is advancing using improved approaches to health care service delivery, both technologically and with a developed workforce.
Departments.
The Hospital consists of the following clinical and diagnostics departments.

Mill Brook Bridge

The Mill Brook Bridge is a historic stone arch bridge, located just north of Lower Blissville Road in Lisbon, Connecticut. With a plausibly estimated construction date of the 1790s, it is probably the oldest surviving stone arch bridge in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Since then, it has deteriorated and is partially collapsed.
Description and history.
The Mill Brook Bridge is located several hundred yards east of the Shetucket River, on the north side of Lower Blissville Road just west of its junction with Icehouse and Blissville Roads. It is a single-span masonry arch, with a span of about across Mill Brook, which the roadway crosses on a modern steel girder bridge. The arch is built out of roughly hewn rubble stone, and was originally laid dry (without any mortar. It would have been topped by layers of soil, with a roadbed above. The arch originally had a width of about . The bridge's top layers have been eroded away, and part of the arch has collapsed.
The bridge was originally located where Lower Blissville Road now runs; it was relocated to its present position in 1915, when a modern bridge was built on the site. The road has been a historically important route, opened by 1717 as a route connecting Norwich and Plainfield. By the late 18th century, the route had been designated as a post route, resulting in an increase in stagecoach traffic. In 1790, the town of Lisbon made a number of improvements to the route, documented in 1792 to include a "stone causeway" on Bundy Hill, the slope to the west. The bridge's dry laid and rough cut construction is consistent with bridge building of the period, where later bridge construction tended to use mortar and more formally dressed stone.

AURES Holdings, a.s., runs the used car outlets in the Czech Republic, where most of its business activities are also located. In addition, it has branches in Slovakia (AUTOCENTRUM AAA AUTO a.s.), Hungary and Poland (Autocentrum AAA AUTO sp.z o.o.). AAA AUTO has branches in 22 cities in the Czech Republic, 14 in Slovakia, 1 in Hungary and 5 in Poland. In September 2017, the company recorded its two millionth customer.
In 2016, AAA AUTO International, a.s. was ranked 48 in the "Czech TOP 100" listing of the most important companies in the Czech Republic (ranked by revenue). According to the audited earnings for 2016, the company reported sales of €276,000,000 and sold 68,772 cars.
Since 2012, the company has also been offering cars under the Mototechna brand. In Czechia and Slovakia this brand concentrates on offering “nearly new” cars. In April 2014, Mototechna started selling luxury cars in its new Mototechna premium segment. In 2013, a study by Ogilvy &amp; Mather ranked AAA AUTO among the top ten Czech brands post November 1989. A study by Medea Research found the Mototechna brand was also one of the most popular re-established Czech brands from before 1989. In January 2018, the company set up the AuresLab innovation laboratory, which is a start-up run by the innovator and executive director Stanislav Gálik.
The AAA AUTO business model is based on purchasing cars for cash, so that they are transferred directly to the company's ownership. This differs from the rest of the market (where typically used cars are sold predominantly in the form of commission sales). AAA AUTO also provides a lifetime money-back guarantee on the cars it sells if there are any legal problems with the vehicle's origins. It also provides Car-life insurance for any mechanical and electrical defects and the option of replacing the car for another within seven days.
In September 2007, the Dutch parent company, AAA Auto Group N.V., went on the stock exchanges in Prague and Budapest, and the initial price per share on the stock exchange was CZK 55. Trading in the company's shares ended on both exchanges in the summer of 2013. Prior to the cessation of trading, the company offered to buy back the shares for CZK 23.30 per share. Since 2014, the majority owner of the AAA AUTO Group has been a British-Polish private equity fund, Abris Capital Partners, which gradually acquired a 100% share that it purchased for €220 million (about CZK 6 billion), roughly CZK 95 per share. Following the statutory share buy-out, the Abris fund became the 100% owner of the group in June 2015. The companies in the group were then brought together in an international merger, which meant the company's headquarters moved to the Czech Republic and the name changed to AAA Auto International a.s. The company then changed its name to AURES Holdings, a.s. on 1 March 2018.
The AAA AUTO brand was awarded the prestigious Superbrands Award for 2017 and 2018 and came second in the European Business Awards 2016/2017. The AAA AUTO and Mototechna brands are the official partner of the Czech premier football league - the Fortuna League.

<doc id="56891722" url="?curid=56891722" title="March 20–22, 2018 nor'easter">
March 20–22, 2018 nor'easter

The March 20–22, 2018 nor'easter (dubbed the "Four'easter" in some media outlets) was a significant late-season nor'easter – the fourth to affect the Northeastern United States during the month of March 2018 – that impacted the Mid-Atlantic states and New England with over of heavy snow and whiteout conditions. The three previous such storms had struck the general region on March 1–3, 6–8, and 12–14, respectively. It also affected areas of the Southeastern and Midwestern United States with both snowfall and severe weather. The nor'easter was also one of the heaviest spring snowstorms on record in some areas in the Mid-Atlantic, especially Philadelphia and New York City. Originating from a surface low that formed over the Rocky Mountains, the system tracked across the central United States, bringing some wintry weather to surrounding areas as well as severe weather in the South. It then reached the Northeastern U.S. on March 20–21 and – while moving slowly near the shorelines of Delaware, New Jersey and Long Island – dropped heavy snowfall with rates of up to an hour in some spots. The storm was given unofficial names such as "Winter Storm Toby" and "Nor'easter 4".
The storm caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled in advance, and caused many school districts to close for the following day or two. Over 100,000 power outages were reported as a result of the nor'easter. At least 3 people have been killed in the nor'easter as of March 21. In addition, the system produced a tornado outbreak in the Southeast, spawning at least 20 tornadoes on March 19, one of which was a long-tracked EF3 that hit Jacksonville, Alabama causing considerable damage.
Meteorological history.
On March 18, an area of low pressure consolidated over the Rocky Mountains, bringing moderate to heavy snow to those locations. Over the next day or two, this low slowly moved eastward across the Central United States, while also interacting with a stationary front located in the Southeast. This ultimately resulted in a severe weather outbreak in the South late on March 19, producing at least nineteen confirmed tornadoes, one of which was rated an EF3. As the system moved eastwards towards the Eastern United States, it was still somewhat uncertain how much snow the storm would produce, which depended on its track and intensity; as the impending storm grew closer it became increasingly likely a major snowstorm would occur. Precipitation began to spread into the Mid-Atlantic states by early March 20. This first phase of the nor'easter brought freezing rain and snow to much of the Tri-State area, before it began dissipating later that night while snow continued over the Appalachian Mountains from an associated but weakening low. At the same time, a new surface low formed off the Chesapeake Bay around 03:00 UTC on March 21, prompting the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) to begin issuing storm summaries on the developing nor'easter.
After forming, the storm began intensifying as it slowly moved northward parallel to the East Coast, with a large swath of moderate to heavy snow covering the area of New Jersey and Long Island in the morning hours of March 21. Contrary to the previous nor'easters, there was colder air further south then in other storms, which allowed accumulating snow to stick more quickly in areas near southern New Jersey throughout the day. Due to moving slowly near the coast, bands of heavy snowfall (with some embedded rates of up to per hour) hammered the coastline as it continued to slowly move eastward. By the following day, the system attained a minimum pressure of around . Shortly afterwards however, at 15:00 UTC, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the nor'easter as most of the snow in New England had tapered off.
Preparations and impact.
Severe weather in the South.
Before impacting the Northeast, the system was also responsible for producing severe weather across the South on March 19–20, with at least twenty tornadoes being confirmed by the National Weather Service (NWS). One possible tornado late on March 19 was reported as having caused "unbelievable destruction" in the town of Fulton, Alabama. Another devastating tornado, the first to be rated EF3 of the year, hit Jacksonville, Alabama, which caused extensive damage to both the city and to Jacksonville State University (although many of its students were on spring break at the time).
Mid-Atlantic regions.
Having been affected by three previous nor'easters in the month of March, the impending storm caused intense preparation across the region. In the early morning hours of March 20, several hundred flights were either canceled or rerouted ahead of the storm. More than 4,000 flights were canceled on March 21, mainly because of the nor'easter. Amtrak modified or canceled service on several trains running along the Northeast Corridor on March 21 and 22 due to the nor'easter. Over 100,000 people lost power from the nor'easter.
In Virginia, state offices in Richmond opened two hours late on March 21. The Virginia State Police responded to more than 250 crashes on the morning of March 21. Virginia Railway Express suspended service on March 21 due to the snow.
All federal offices in Washington, D.C. were closed on March 21 due to the nor'easter. Schools across the Washington, D.C. area were closed. The Washington Metro saw lower ridership while bus service on Metrobus and suburban bus systems was reduced due to the nor'easter.
In Maryland, the nor'easter brought heavy snow to areas that very rarely receive heavy snowfall so late in the month. Schools in Baltimore were closed on March 21 due to the nor'easter. MARC Train and MTA commuter bus service were both suspended on March 21. Several accidents were reported across the state due to the snow. A school bus driver in Frederick County had to be removed after the bus slid off a roadway due to wintry conditions. No one was injured in the incident.
In Delaware, Governor John Carney declared a state of emergency starting at midnight on March 21. State offices in New Castle County were closed on March 21. Governor Carney issued a Level 1 driving warning in New Castle and Kent counties effective at 2:45 p.m. on March 21, encouraging motorists not to be out on the roads. DART First State suspended bus service in New Castle and Kent counties at 6 p.m. on March 21. The nor'easter caused flooding along River Road in Oak Orchard. Coastal flooding brought waves to the dunes in Rehoboth Beach and onshore at the Indian River Inlet Bridge, causing moderate beach erosion. A walkway leading to the beach in Bethany Beach was washed away by high tide.
In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf put over 450 Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers on standby. In Philadelphia, a snow emergency was declared for March 21, with schools and government offices shut down. SEPTA modified their service plan for March 21 due to the snow, with Regional Rail trains running on a modified Saturday schedule and Broad Street Line and Market-Frankford Line trains running during the overnight hours. In addition, several SEPTA bus routes were placed on detours in advance of the storm. PennDOT reported that it had around 400 snow trucks and over 70,000 pounds of salt ready to clear roadways during the storm. Authorities from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission announced that the speed limit would be reduced to on the entire length of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension, with a truck and trailer ban enacted for the entire turnpike starting at 8 p.m on March 20. PennDOT also lowered the speed limit to on several freeways in the southeastern part of the state and implemented truck and trailer bans on select freeways in the eastern part of the state. A crash involving two tractor-trailers shut down the westbound Pennsylvania Turnpike west of Reading. Two police officers were taken to the hospital following a crash on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia during the storm. Two people were killed in a crash in Horsham on March 20 when their car slid on ice and hit another car head on. The bus carrying the Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team to the airport for a charter flight to Boston for their NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 game got stuck in the snow trying to leave the campus and took ten attempts to get freed.
In the Lehigh Valley, LANTA buses operated on snow emergency detours, with service suspended at 4 p.m. on March 21. In Berks County, BARTA suspended bus service starting at 5 p.m. on March 21. Bieber Tourways canceled most of its buses between the Reading and Lehigh Valley areas and Philadelphia and New York City on March 21. The cities of Allentown and Reading opened downtown parking garages to residents to park for free.
In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning at 7 p.m. on March 20. All state offices in New Jersey were closed on March 21. On March 20, the Wave Parking Garage in Atlantic City offered to allow residents to park for free during the nor'easter. Rutgers University announced that all classes would be cancelled on March 21, due to the nor'easter. New Jersey Transit suspended bus service starting at 3 p.m. on March 21 due to the storm, while train service ran on a limited weekday schedule. The New Jersey State Police banned commercial vehicles along Interstate 78, Interstate 80, Interstate 280, and Interstate 287. One person was in intensive care following an accident along Interstate 78 in Hunterdon County. An 87-year-old woman with dementia and Alzheimer's was found dead in the snow in Toms River. Demi Lovato was forced to reschedule a concert in Newark due to the snowstorm, the new date of Lovato's concert will be April 2. The nor'easter caused beach erosion at the Jersey Shore, including Brigantine and Ocean City, which had just seen beach replenishment. Street flooding occurred in Ocean City from the nor'easter.
In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York City, Long Island, and Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam counties. Schools in New York City were closed on March 21 due to the nor'easter and the city issued a Snow Alert. 12-18 inches of snow fell across the region. Governor Cuomo issued a travel ban for tractor-trailers along several Interstate highways in the New York City area. The nor'easter forced the modification of service along the New York City Subway. The Metro-North Railroad operated on a reduced weekday schedule. Justin Timberlake was forced to cancel a concert at Madison Square Garden on March 21, to be rescheduled on a later date. A van flipped over on the Wantagh State Parkway in Nassau County from the snow, killing one person and injuring five other people. A 62-year-old woman in Bellmore died of a heart attack while shoveling snow. The nor'easter caused several accidents on Long Island, including an accident between two tractor-trailers on the Long Island Expressway in North Hills.
Governor Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island announced that all state services would be closed on March 21 due to the storm. Schools in Providence were closed on March 21.
Other regions.
Winter weather advisories and winter storm watches and warnings were issued in parts of the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, as snow was expected to accumulate and blanket parts of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky - and as far south as the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and into central Appalachia.
Naming.
The storm has received several different unofficial names from different media outlets. The Weather Channel, which names significant winter storms that have disruptive impacts on major cities, assigned the name "Toby" to the winter storm. On social media, Reuters and several other news outlets referred to the storm as the ""Four'easter" or "Nor'easter 4"" (signifying it was the fourth such storm to impact the Northeastern U.S in the month of March). The National Weather Service has stated though that, unlike hurricanes, it does not name winter storms. The practice of winter storm naming remains controversial in the United States.

Characteristics.
The school's motto is "Study Extensively, Discriminate Clearly, Reflect Carefully, Practice Earnestly" ("Chinese: 博学 明辨 善思 笃行").
Since 2014, the school has started a revolution over its in-class teaching pattern. After several years of trial, its new "1+4+2" teaching method has been popularized over the entire school. According to vice-principal Zhang Yanqi, under this new pattern, the students are not only listeners in class, but also have the opportunity to discuss their own ideas and instantly utilize the newly-learned knowledge. The students are no longer studying passively; instead, they actively preview, learn, discuss and review the class materials. The new pattern is expected to effectively improve the learning outcome as well as students' learning ability. 
Campus facility.
The campus is equipped with comprehensive facilities to cater for students' basic need of living and studying:

Swedish Armoured Troops

Swedish Armoured Troops (, P) is the armoured branch of the Swedish Army. Since 2005, the Armoured Troops include the South Scanian Regiment (P 7) in Revingehed, Skaraborg Regiment (P 4) in Skövde, Norrbotten Armoured Battalion in Boden, and since 2018 also Gotland Regiment (P 18).
History.
1920s–1960s.
In Sweden, after World War I, a smaller number of tanks were procured. The training with these was located to Svea Life Guards (I 1). According to the Defence Act of 1925, a tank battalion was organized, which was placed to Göta Life Guards (I 2). A tank battalion was organized at Göta Life Guards (I 2) from 1928 to 1939 and after the regiment was disbanded in 1930, tank battalions were organized in Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) and Södermanland Regiment (I 10) between 1939 and 1942. Parallel attempts were made with armored cars in the cavalry between 1925 and 1942 and with motorized brigade between 1940 and 1942.
The Swedish Armoured Troops were formed on 1 October 1942. According to the Defence Act of 1942, the armoured troops were organized in peace-time as an independent branch of four armoured regiments (Göta Armoured Life Guards, Scanian Armoured Regiment, Södermanland Armoured Regiment and Skaraborg Armoured Regiment). The Swedish Armoured Troops were organized in war-time in armoured brigades consisting of, among other things, a tank and two armoured infantry battalions and an artillery battalion.
The four armored brigades - Pbrig m/43 - were created to meet the need for powerful attack units that could break through a defensive position and quickly proceed behind enemy lines. The brigades would be trained and organized by the aforementioned four regiments:
Two educational institutions were also formed, the Swedish Armoured Troops School (PS) - located at P 4, and the Swedish Armoured Troops Officer Candidate School (POAS) - located at P 3 - later to P 1. The war-organized brigades had two tanks battalions and one "panzergrenadier" battalion with KP-bil's, among others. The design of the field brigades, together with newly acquired war experiences from World War II, resulted in the 1949 parliamentary decision that also Svea Life Guards (I 1) in Sörentorp, Älvsborg Regiment (I 5) in Borås and the South Scanian Infantry Regiment ("Södra skånska infanteriregementet", I 7) in Ystad were converted to armoured infantry regiments under the Inspector of the Swedish Armoured Troops' jurisdiction to ensure a unified training closely related to the existing armoured regiments and a joint brigade production of five brigades - Pbrig 49.
This brigade organization with, among other things, different rates of movement between the tanks and armoured infantry battalions (the main part on military bicycles) reduced the brigade's attack power and was quickly outrun by international development with its demands for higher standards, mobility and constant division in the battlefield. Already at the end of the war, Sweden was unhelpful in technical development. Therefore, a large number of heavy tanks (Centurion) were purchased in 1953 and a reorganization - Pbrig 58 - started with mixed battalions which included a tank and two bicycle transporting infantry companies, one of which could be transported on KP-bil's. Attacks were carried out on foot and the tank was given a supporting role. The attack speed was limited to 5 km/h. Older tanks' gun turrets were used as gun turret fortifications at ports and airfields, and Stridsvagn m/41 and Stridsvagn m/42 were rebuilt into Pansarbandvagn 301 and Stridsvagn 74 respectively.
At the armoured regiments, assault gun companies (Infanterikanonvagn 72, 73, 102 and 103) were also trained, self-propelled anti-tank companies (Pansarvärnskanonvagn m/43), anti-aircraft gun platoons (40 mm L/60) and crews for self-propelled assault guns (Stormartillerivagn m/43). In 1957, the Norrbotten Armoured Battalion (P 5) was raised to meet the needs of armoured combat units in Upper Norrland. In the same year, P 3 was reorganized into I 10 and became an armoured infantry regiment. I 1 returned to the infantry.
1960s–1980s.
In order to increase the attack force of the armoured brigade, extensive materiel and organizational experiments were carried out in the early 1960s. The final product became Pbrig 63 with armoured battalions consisting of two self-propelled "panzergrenadier" companies (Pansarbandvagn 301 and later Pansarbandvagn 302) and two tanks with either Centurion (Stridsvagn 101, 102) or the unconventionally Swedish-built S-Tank (Stridsvagn 103) as main tank and its own artillery (10.5 cm howitzer). Pbrig 63, with its mobile, firepower, integrated and combat technology well thought out organization, attracted great international interest and praise. The peace organization changed so that I 6, I 7, I 10 and I 18 became new armoured regiments while I 15 returned to the infantry.
The reduction of defence appropriations in the 1970s and 1980s forced reductions in both the war and peace organizations. In 1971, the war organization consisted of six armoured brigades, four Norrland brigades, 21 infantry brigades, about 100 command, support and maintenance battalions, and about 100 local defence battalions. In the late 1970s, the fully motorized infantry brigade 77 was introduced, but half of the older infantry brigades and two of the armored brigades were disbanded. P 1 was disbanded in 1980 and the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School (PKAS) was amalgamated with the Swedish Armoured Troops School (PS) in Skövde. P 10's armoured brigade was reorganized into a mechanized brigade.
1990s–2000s.
In 1994, the organization changed by introducing the concept of mechanized brigade. At that time, the army's field units consisted of two armoured brigades, four mechanized brigades (fewer tanks than the armored brigades), seven infantry brigades and four Norrland brigades. The mechanization process of these two later brigade types continued during the 1990s with the goal of forming fully mechanized brigades in 2000 (IB 2000/NB 2000). However, all brigades were disbanded in the war organization according to the Defence Act of 2000.
The procurement of the Leopard 2 system started in 1991. After evaluation in 1994 the German Leopard 2 Improved (Stridsvagn 122) was elected. Stridsvagn 122 would replace Stridsvagn 103 in the armoured brigades. Sweden was also given the opportunity to acquire used Leopard 2A4 (Stridsvagn 121) at a low price, which would replace the Centurion's in the mechanized brigades. The deliveries of the 120 Stridsvagn 122 began in 1997 and were completed in 2002. The transfer of the 160 pcs used Leopard 2A4 (Stridsvagn 121) to Sweden was completed in 1995. In connection with the acquisition of Leopard 2, the remaining Stridsvagn 101 and Stridsvagn 102 began to be eliminated in 1992 pending scrapping. Remaining were 80 Stridsvagn 104 at the Kristianstad Brigade (PB 26), but this brigade would disbanded in 1994. In connection with this, 60 tanks from the Kristianstad Brigade were transferred in 1992 to Södermanland Brigade (MekB 10), where they were in service until 1994, when they were transferred to Gotland to upgrade and modernize the Gotland Brigade (MekB 18). The tanks came to serve at the Gotland Brigade until the Defence Act of 2000, when the tank training stopped at the brigade and Stridsvagn 104's were scrapped.
In 2000, the Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) was commissioned by the Swedish Armed Forces to dismantle Stridsvagn 103, Stridsvagn 104, Brobandvagn 941, Bärgningsbandvagn 81, Bärgningsbandvagn 82, Infanterikanonvagn 91, Luftvärnsrobotvagn 701 and Pansarvärnsrobotvagn 551. Bärgningsbandvagn 81 was eliminated after 2004 and was replaced by the Bärgningsbandvagn 120.
2010s–present.
The Swedish Armoured Troops consist in 2020s of South Scanian Regiment (P 7) in Revingehed, Skaraborg Regiment (P 4) in Skövde, and since 2018 also Gotland Regiment (P 18). P 7 consist, among other units, of the 71st Battalion, a motorized infantry battalion equipped with Pansarterrängbil 360, and the 72nd Battalion, a mechanized battalion equipped with Stridsvagn 122 and Combat Vehicle 90. P 4 consist, among other units, of the 41st and the 42nd Armoured Battalion. The main weapon systems of the armored battalions are Stridsvagn 122, Combat Vehicle 9040, 12 cm grenade launchers and anti-air vehicles. P 18 consists, among other units, of the 181st Armoured Battalion, formed in January 2020.
In Upper Norrland, the Norrbotten Armoured Battalion has operated since 1957. Today its part of Norrbotten Regiment (I 19). The Norrbotten Armoured Battalion is organized for the daily production of war units and consists of personnel from the 191st and 192nd Mechanized Battalions.
Inspector of the Swedish Armoured Troops.
The head was called Inspector of the Swedish Armoured Troops ("Pansarinspektören"). The Inspector was from 1991 to 1995 the head of the Swedish Army Armoured Center ("Arméns pansarcentrum", PaC). Below is a list of inspectors active in the years 1942–1995.
