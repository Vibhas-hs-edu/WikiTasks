Help Needed

Help Needed () is a charitable foundation that helps other charities and social projects in Russia. The mission of the foundation is systematic development of charity in the country and change of public attitude towards solving social problems.
The foundation systematically implements projects aimed at interaction and development of all parts of society related to solving social problems. The main goal is to strengthen the nonprofit sector in Russia, so that employees could maintain high professional level; the number of charities and NGOs would be sufficient to address the needs of vulnerable population; and finally, all citizens would be actively involved in solving social problems.
The foundation works as a fund of funds, fundraising for other non-profit organizations, including charitable foundations. While it helps other organizations, it does not provide targeted assistance to beneficiaries. All projects supported by Help Needed are being carefully verified.
History of the foundation.
In 2012 Mitya Aleshkovsky, a photographer for the TASS news agency came to Krymsk for an editorial assignment.
After he led the development of support system that efficiently helped local residents suffered from a terrible flood, Aleshkovsky has decided to leave photojournalism and devote himself entirely to charity. In 2013 Aleshkovskiy and a group of journalists started a charitable program HelpNeeded.ru, which operated under Mosaic of Happiness charitable foundation.
Help Needed charitable foundation was registered on September 1, 2015. The co-founders were Mitya Aleshkovsky, who headed the foundation Board and Anna Semenova, who became the director of the new organization. Previously, Anna Semenova worked for the "Our Children" foundation (2012-2014), "Volunteers for orphans" (2007-2012), and for “Start” (2004-2007). Anna graduated from the Sociology Faculty of Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov.
Board of the foundation is the supreme collegiate body with the key function to ensure that the foundation meets the objectives for which it was set up. Operations are overseen by the Board of Trustees. The duties of the Board and the Board of Trustees are determined by the statute of the foundation.
Activities.
«Takie dela».
"Takie dela" web portal was launched on May 25, 2015. The project name comes from the Russian phrase “Такие дела” which means something like “so it goes”. The main goal of the project was to use high-quality journalism as a powerful tool for systematic resolving of social problems in Russia. By and large, the portal put the average man back into the agenda of modern media, rediscovering traditions of social journalism and creating new media approach - the fundraising text. Every day the portal posts fundraising articles about the wards of charitable projects, which it supports. At the end of such materials readers are encouraged to make a regular donation of any amount to help the particular project.
To provide the full transparency, all fundraising results, budgets of supported project which are verified by the Help Needed experts, as well as own reports of the foundation are published online and publicly available.
In addition to fundraising articles, the portal publishes editorial materials. Andrei Loshak and Pavel Pryanikov were editors-in-chief in 2015-2016. Since 2016 the project is led by Valery Panyushkin. The visual department is headed by Andrei Polikanov, who worked as a photo editor for "Time" magazine, headed the department of photography in the Russian "Reporter" magazine and currently serves as a member of jury for the World Press Photo. "Takie dela" received various awards, including the Government media prize in 2017 for "creating a new format of a resource support of charity in Russia", the Sakharov Prize and others.
Special Projects Department.
The special projects department is a part of "Takie dela" web portal focused on the production of new forms of media covering “tough” and unpopular topics.
In March 2017 an animated web documentary titled “There once lived...” was released in honor of the Homeless Day. Interactive online project tells five stories of real people and received several awards of the Great Eight festival (G8).
Special projects team is also accounted for "The best digital news story" Prize of the international festival Visa pour l'Image given to "Kosa and Kamen" (Warm Waters in English). Project created in collaboration with photographer Vlad Sokhin is devoted to climate change at the Russian Far east.
Sluchaem.ru - taking the opportunity.
In December 2016, Help Needed launched an online platform, Sluchaem.ru (literally “Taking the opportunity"), aimed at involving broader audience into fundraising for charity projects. The service allows anyone to raise funds for non-profit projects using any occasion like birthday, anniversary, sport event or anything else. Users can create pages for their events and take this opportunity to invite their friends, colleagues and subscribers to raise funds for the projects they support.
Research.
Study of the non-profit sector in Russia is one of the key activities of the foundation. Researchers of the foundation systematically collect, analyze and evaluate data on the sector. All research materials are publicly available on the foundation website.
Charitable tours.
At the end of 2017, Help Needed won the Russian Presidential grant to implement the Charity Tours program in far east regions of the country. The ultimate goal of the program is to develop Russian civic society through combining efforts of regional NGOs and media, local authorities and business stakeholders. At the local level the project’s goal is to enhance professional skills of regional non-profit organizations.
Publishing house.
In 2017, the foundation opened its own publishing house to print books on charity, philanthropy and various aspects of development of non-profit sector of the economy. According to the foundation’s Board chairman, Mitya Aleshkovskiy, it is a logical and very important step for the foundation to regularly publish books which are essential for everyone involved in solving social problems. The first book issued by the house was Russian edition of global bestseller by American writer, entrepreneur and activist Dan Pallotta, "Uncharitable – How Restraints on Nonprofits Undermine Their Potential".

Nahla Mahmoud

Nahla Mahmoud (born 1986/7) is a Sudanese-born British writer, ex-Muslim, secularist, environmentalist, and human rights activist, and spokesperson for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. She fled to the United Kingdom in 2010.
Early life and education.
Mahmoud was born in Wau, Sudan and raised as a Sunni Muslim. In primary school art class, she drew a picture of Allah, which is considered forbidden by most Muslims, and her teacher punished her for it. Mahmoud was disgruntled by the fact that she did not enjoy the same rights as boys and men, that she couldn't draw or sculpt what she wanted, or keep a dog as a pet, that she was not allowed to ask critical questions, and that she could not learn about evolution.
Mahmoud studied ecology at the University of Khartoum, and worked for the Science Students Association. At university she came across a professor who opposed the Omar al-Bashir regime; he had just been released from jail where he had been tortured for teaching the theory of evolution. This revelation shocked her and made her feel like she 'didn't exist in Sudan as woman, as a scientist'. “These incidents made me gradually refuse Islam until I completely renounced it and became an atheist.” This made life even more difficult for her, because under Sudanese law, apostasy could be punishable by the death penalty. Mahmoud resolved that she no longer wanted to live under Sharia in Sudan, and eventually fled to the UK in 2010.
Activism.
Sharia interview controversy.
Mahmoud became a spokesperson for the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB). In this capacity she appeared in a short (1 minute, 39 seconds) televised interview on Channel 4's "4thought.tv" in January 2013 to give her perspective on "What does Sharia law have to offer Britain?". She recounted how she grew up living under Sharia in Sudan, where she was ‘always dealt with as a second-class citizen, always brought up to believe that I am an incomplete human being [who] needed a man as a guard.’ Mahmoud found it astonishing that Britain, the country she had fled to escape Islamic rule, maintained a similar system of sharia courts, arguing that ‘Everyone should have equal rights and live under one secular law.’ This interview led her to be targeted by an Islamist hate campaign, led by Salah Al Bander, director of the Sudan Civic Foundation and a former LibDem councillor in Cambridge City Council, who called Mahmoud a ‘Kafira’ (unbeliever) on a Sudanese Arabic website. He stated that ‘I will not forgive anyone who wants to start a battle against Islam and the beliefs of the people’. When mosques and Sudanese newspapers took up the campaign against her, Mahmoud received numerous death threats and both she and her family in Sudan were harassed; her brother over there was physically attacked. Even the official Facebook page of the Sudanese Armed Forces called Mahmoud an infidel and apostate. The local LibDem leader, Spencer Hagard, who investigated Al Bander, saw no fault in his behaviour, and even regarded him more highly than before. Mahmoud filed a complaint with the police, but received no protection, and instead got the suggestion to keep quiet about her views.
Ex-Muslim rights.
At the Secular Conference 2014, Mahmoud highlighted the aggression from Islamists faced by ex-Muslims, critics of Islam, atheists of all backgrounds, and anti-traditional liberal Muslims, commenting that it was "really scary" that a 2011 Policy Exchange survey found that 34% of British Muslims aged 16 to 24 supported the death penalty for apostasy. She rebuked the regressive left attitude of some Westerners who dismiss any kind of criticism of Islam as 'islamophobia', and ignore Islamic intolerance in the spirit of 'multiculturalism'.
Mahmoud has estimated that during the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, there have been between 120 and 170 Sudanese citizens who have been convicted for apostasy, most of whom repented to avoid a death sentence.
Mahmoud appeared in "Among Nonbelievers" (2015), a Dutch documentary on HUMAN about the situation of ex-Muslims worldwide.
Environmentalism.
Mahmoud is an environmentalist who is passionate about nature, and received training as an ecologist. In her 2013 research paper "Climate Change and Violent Conflicts in East Africa" for the Evelyn Oldfield Unit, she sought to "[question] the traditional analyses of conflicts, which rely primarily on ethnic, religious, and cultural explanations since these do not take account of the increasingly obvious link between the growing scarcity of renewable resources and violent conflict in the three East African countries [Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Shortages of cropland, fresh water, woodland, pasture and marine resources cannot be ignored."

Operation Royal Amethyst

Operation Royal Amethyst was a military operation carried out by the Portuguese Guinean Battalion of Commandos, which was held on 8 May 1973 in the course of the Colonial War in Guinea-Bissau, which had the purpose of "annihilating or at least dismantling the organisation of the guerrillas in the region of Guidaje-Bigene".
Background.
The operation divided the battalion into three groups:
After embarkation of the Battalion of Commandos onto a Large Landing Craft (LDG), which was then escorted by two LFDs the unit landed in Ganturé and attended a briefing in Bigene.
The Operation.
The operation began at 11:50pm north. The first contact with the forces of the PAIGC was triggered by the Bombox Group after initial aerial bombardment by Fiat G.91 aircraft.
At 5:30am on 19 May, the column's head reached the route that supported the Cumbamori base, the main objective of the operation. The Bombox Group passed north of the road, the Centauro Group occupied positions to the south and the Grouping Romeu was installed in the rear, in a small town.
At 8:00am and 8:00pm, air strikes were conducted by Fiat G.91 fighter-bombers, which destroyed the base's bunkers, and the guerrillas munitions were on fire for a period of time.
At 9:05am the Bombox Group performed the initial assault, causing the first contact with the PAIGC forces. This fighting took place from the 14th and 10th, when the commander of the operation ordered the Centauro Group to support a rupture of contact between its forces and those of the PAIGC. It was an operation of great difficulty, because the fighters on both sides were very close to each other. The Centaur Group commander was wounded.
At 14:30, the Commando Battalion began to move to the collection base, and at 6:20pm its first elements arrived in Guidaje. On 20 May the battalion left Guidaje for Sinta, on foot, leaving there their wounded and the military who were not in conditions to continue the march. In Sinta, the battalion embarked on an LDG to return to Bissau.
Aftermath.
During the operation, the Battalion suffered ten troops killed, twenty-two troops seriously wounded, and three troops missing, estimated to have caused sixty-seven deaths, among which, according to information later obtained in Senegal, a Cuban physician and surgeon and four Mauritanians.

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea campaigns (1944)

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea in World War II during 1944 involved engagements between submarines of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet attacking Axis merchantmen, defended by Romanian and German naval warships, as well as German U-boats and Romanian submarines attacking Soviet merchants on the eastern Black Sea. Before the conclusion of the campaign, Romania joined the Allies after King Michael's Coup. These engagements were a part of the naval Black Sea campaigns.
Background.
As during the first 1941 campaign, the 1942 campaign and the 1943 campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea: at the beginning of the year however the Soviet Navy possessed only 16 operative submarines. German U-boats of the 30th U-boat Flotilla operated on the eastern sites of Black Sea, attacking Soviet targets. The Romanian Navy employed the newly built submarines NMS Marsuinul and NMS Rechinul but without scoring success. It also inherited five CB-class midget submarines left by Italy, however only two of them were operable by July 1944 and were not used in offensive action.
Outcome.
The German anti-submarine capabilities in 1944 effectively neutralized the threat of Soviet submarines in the Black Sea. On the other hand, a combination of heavy Soviet anti-submarine actions prevented the 2 newly built Romanian submarines to achieve successes, while the 30th U-boat Flotilla was effectively eliminated by the combined effect of an air raid on Costanta on 20 August and the following King Michael's Coup (negating the survived U-boats a safe harbor and forcing their scuttling).

Exhibition 211

Exhibition 211 (at the time referred to as simply 'Exhibition' or '211') was a six-month-long continuous art-experiment as exhibition, that ran from March until August 2009 in New York City. It was initiated through a series of discussions between Warren Neidich and Mathieu Copelands in 2010 in Paris and New York City. But the series of instruments for its production, like the role of the roll of dice, the picking of cut up names out of a hat and the rules of engagement, see below, came later through discussions between Warren Neidich and Eric Angles. These were further formulated when the program was initiated and programmed by artist friends Elena Bajo, Eric Anglès, Jakob Schillinger, Nathalie Anglès, and Warren Neidich, offering "an experimental and contradictory artistic and curatorial approach", notably a set of rules, defining when, where, and who by, artistic interventions would take place.
The project was established in the loaned storefront of 211 Elizabeth, a luxury condominium development. Being close to the New Museum, and two blocks from Prada and Armani, "Exhibition" spoke not only to the current economic climate, following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, but the problems of art treated as a (luxury) commodity.
About Exhibition, Artist Diana Artus wrote: "The most important principle was that only one exhibition will be shown, during which time it will be in continuous development, as new people – artists, curators, and others known by the initiators – are invited to participate", she also wrote that "a fundamental aim was to provoke differences of opinion, rather than placate them."
"Exhibition (211)" exhibited over 50, and up to 100 artists, including: Boshko Boskovic, Mathieu Copeland, Loretta Fahrenholz, Donna Huanca, Sean Raspet, Alexis Knowlton, Liz Magic Laser, David Levine, An Te Lieu, Jen Liu, Jason Loebs, Emily Mast, Amy Patton, Georgia Sagri, Alexandre Singh
Mark Tribe, and B. Wurtz. Although each artist's work was not specifically identified due to the rules of adaptation and evolution involved in their participation.
Rules.
The approach, guided by a set of rules, became integral to the forms and conversations that pursued. Elena Bajo, Eric Anglès, Jakob Schillinger, Nathalie Anglès, and Warren Neidich discussed many potential artists to be invited, the names of which were then put into, and subsequently drawn from a hat. The artist would then be invited to space and asked if they would work with the concept and requirements:
On May 12, 2009, Kemi Ilesanmi described Exhibition for Art 21 Magazine: "at least every three days, there is a new artist intervention, and while they can make whatever manner of changes inside the space, artists may not remove their own art works afterwards.""
The approach of "Exhibition" echoed the cut-up technique by Bryon Gysin and William S. Burroughs, which is also visible in Warren Neidich's own artistic practice.
The method is simple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. Now cut down the middle and cross the middle. You have four sections: 1 2 3 4 ... one two three four. Now rearrange the sections placing section four with section one and section two with section three. And you have a new page. Sometimes it says much the same thing. Sometimes something quite different--(cutting up political speeches is an interesting exercise)--in any case you will find that it says something and something quite definite.

Topics and discussions.
Reflecting on the standard exhibition format, where "under the right light and organized by a strict aesthetic, the works displayed and valued are typically individual, finished objects", Diana Artus explained that exhibitions are therefore generally complicit with capitalism: "extolling the rules of a market society".
Contrasting to this "Exhibition" worked against this system, "when an exhibition diverges from this format, the result is revealing not only art's continual complicity with capitalism, but also how, and with what consequences, the notion of such a ritual could be reconfigured". As a summary of the type of engagement between the collaborators in Exhibition Artus said at the end of her article: "The notion of striving in a competitive world is reinterpreted in such a way that is promising: not only are we struggling against each other, but – more importantly – for each other."
In an important dialogue between the founders, published by Art Lies, Elena Bajo further mused on the problem of capital explicit in exhibition formats: "Perhaps limiting actions to a specific site, which is free of rent, and creating a temporary time-frame of six months and a set of rules in which chance and conversation play a significant role frees us from the dangers of capitalistic assimilation that beset most large cultural institutions that rely on private funding."
"What is beyond doubt is the amazing density of heady conceptualizing and self-reflexive musing this echo chamber has been injecting into our daily conversation." said Eric Anglès, emphasizing that the social engagement became the most important factor, "what might at first glance look like a theater of freedom and constraint, the rehearsal of a tired dialectic between an artist/curator enforcing the law and an artist/Houdini dancing her way out of those shackles, is far more immediately and compellingly an experimental site where each one of us present in this space is made to decide, over and over again, how to face one other."
Given the complexity of the project, little documentation remains. Warren Neidich discussed the question of the archive "when this experiment closes on the last day of August, what traces will be left for future audiences now transformed into historical readers? Is having a physical archive a complete contradiction to the spirit of the project? Or is it a form of generosity?"

The Old Bank of England

The Old Bank of England is a public house at 194 Fleet Street, where the City of London meets the City of Westminster. 
It was constructed on a corner site in 1886 by Sir Arthur Blomfield in a grand Italianate style, the interior having three large chandeliers with a detailed plaster ceiling. It is a Grade II listed building. 
The building was occupied by the Law Court's branch of the Bank of England from 1888 to 1975 before it was refurbished and put to its current use in 1994. The vaults beneath the pub once contained gold bullion, and are said to have held the Crown Jewels for a period as well. The pub is close to where the fictional Sweeney Todd is said to have plied his trade.
The pub is currently operated by McMullen's Brewery.

Planet Parade () is a 1984 drama film directed by Vadim Abdrashitov. The film's script was written by Aleksandr Mindadze and was based on the final part of the trilogy by Ukrainian writer Yevgeny Gutsalo, novel "Planet Parade". Party primary contest 42nd Venice International Film Festival.
Plot.
The film takes place in the USSR in 1984. Six forty-year-old men are cut off from ordinary life by draft for military reservists, the last one at their age. They represent a cross-section of the Soviet society of that time: an astronomer, a butcher from a shop, a factory worker, a loader, an architect, and a trolleybus driver (elected as people's deputy). Some of them know each other due to previous guerrilla assemblies and are friendly with each other, but by their own admission rarely spend time together — the reasons include work, mundane everyday life which leaves little time for leisure and, in general, differing interests and values. During the military exercises, their artillery battery, having successfully completed the task, was destroyed by the enemy, and the heroes, as ordered by the command, are seemingly dying. Thus, until the end of assembly, they remain in reserve for a few more days. Having missed the train to the city at the station, the heroes, having become "spirits from the other world", decide to finish the war game.
After leaving the training field of battle, the men begin a transcendental journey: they get to a city populated by only beautiful and solitary women. Having sailed across the river from this temptation, the detachment spends the night on the island and, taking the traveling chemist with them, end up in a retirement home, where by a clerk's mistake they are taken for a team of technicians from the repair construction office.
In the retirement home, the feeble-minded old lady mistakes Herman Kostin for her son Fedya, who disappeared during the war. By the will of the circumstances, Herman-Fedya is forced to play this role for several hours, during which he sums up the not very pleasant aspects of his life. Late in the evening, seven travelers with all the elderly inhabitants are trying to observe the mysterious planet parade.
After spending the night in an open field near the village of Guskovo and traveling all the way to the city on foot, the team of the men part, realizing that further men's games military assembly and exercises will not take place anymore, that the last stop has been placed in their departing youth, and most likely they will not meet again. Like planets with different orbits, they only met for a moment and lined up in a "planet parade" only to fly apart forever.

Emma Hutchinson

Emma Sarah Hutchinson (1820–1906) was a Victorian lepidopterist who authored the 1879 book "Entomology and Botany as Pursuits for Ladies" and published in "The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation". She reared butterflies and moths from eggs and her work contributed to understanding of the Lepidoptera life cycle. The summer form of the "Polygonia c-album" butterfly species, known as the comma, is named "hutchinsoni" in her honour.
Early life.
Born as Emma Sarah Gill in 1820, she married Thomas Hutchinson, the vicar of Grantsfield near Kimbolton, in 1847 and spent most of her life in Herefordshire. Hutchinson's interest in butterflies and moths started when her young son captured a swallow-tailed moth.
Scientific practice.
Hutchinson devoted much of her life to the study butterflies and moths, the insect order Lepidoptera. She became known during her lifetime for her skills in rearing butterflies and moths from eggs. She bred the pinion-spotted pug moth for 31 years. Her work contributed to a better understanding of the life cycle of Lepidoptera. She corresponded with well-known entomologists such as Edward Newman, Henry Doubleday, William Buckler, and Henry Tibbats Stainton.
In the Victorian era entomology was fashionable and natural history societies were well attended. Hutchinson's 1879 book "Entomology and Botany as Pursuits for Ladies" went on to become a popular scientific publication. In it she encouraged women to study butterflies instead of just collecting them.
In 1881 her letter on the possible decline of the "Polygonia c-album" butterfly species, known as the comma, was published in "The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation". Hutchinson had studied the habits of the comma for 50 years and put forward the thesis that its decline in Kent was due to the burning of the hop vine after harvest, destroying the larvae and pupae. Hutchinson participated in efforts to reintroduce the comma to parts of England, including Surrey, by collecting comma larvae and pupae in Herefordshire and introducing them into the wild elsewhere. But Hutchinson was convinced that these efforts were hindered by naturalists who collected adult butterflies as specimens for their collections.
Legacy.
In 1937 Hutchinson's collection of 20,000 butterflies and moths was exhibited in the Natural History Museum. Hutchinson's notebooks are held in the library of the Herford Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club.
The summer form of the "Polygonia c-album" butterfly species, known as the comma, is named "hutchinsoni" in her honour.

Anna Alexander

Anna Ellison Butler Alexander (circa 1865 – September 24, 1947) was the first and only African-American consecrated a Deaconess in the Episcopal Church. She served in the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia during her entire career, and may be remembered in the Calendar of saints on September 24.
Early life.
Alexander was born shortly after the American Civil War on St. Simon's Island, Georgia to former slave Daphne Alexander and her husband James Alexander (known by his nickname Aleck). Her birth date was not recorded, and she later gave various different dates, in part because she feared that she would be forbidden to continue to work in her final years as too old (later diocesan records list it as 1878 and her death certificate lists 1880). 
Her father Aleck was the personal servant and aide of his master, Pierce Mease Butler (1810–1861), who owned several plantations inherited from his grandfather, founding father and U.S. Senator Pierce Butler. Aleck Alexander had learned to read and write (despite state laws to the contrary) from Butler's wife, the British actress Fanny Kemble. 
Alexander later wrote that her part-Native American paternal grandmother had received her freedom after nursing Pierce Mease and his brother John Mease, before they assumed their grandfather's surname in order to inherit his plantations. Her parents had married in 1841 and Anna became their eleventh and last child. 
Her maternal grandmother was from Madagascar, and her mother was the result of a rape by a white overseer. Fanny Kemble became estranged from her husband after witnessing such activities at his plantations, particularly by that overseer. She wrote the anti-slavery "Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839", published in 1863 and which helped influence British public opinion against the Confederate cause.
The Alexander family soon moved to Pennick, Georgia to take advantage of land south of the Altamaha River previously held by poor whites who had moved further south to Florida to obtain land under the Southern Homestead Act of 1866. Her father became a carpenter-builder and a community leader. In addition to building his own family's houses, and helping others learn that trade, Aleck Alexander helped build a school for the community and used his own land as an experimental farm.
Career.
Anna first taught at the public school in Pennick. Later, she moved to Darien, Georgia, at the mouth of the Altamaha River, where her sister Mary founded a school affiliated with St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, and all three sisters taught. Anna also visited Brunswick, Georgia and St. Athanasius' Episcopal Church. In 1894, with the cooperation of the Brunswick priest, Anna founded a mission in Pennick, while still teaching at Darien during the week, making a 40-mile round trip by boat and foot. 
The mission faltered when Anna accepted a position at St. Paul's Normal and Industrial School (as well as enrolled in the new teachers college there) in Lawrenceville, Virginia. In 1897, she returned to Pennick and revitalized the mission. The congregation was renamed Church of the Good Shepard, and Alexander also started a school. She supported herself by taking in sewing, and managed to buy property in 1902, where her brother Charles Alexander and other men then erected a church.
In 1907, bishop Cleland Kinloch Nelson addressed the second annual meeting of the diocese's council of colored churchmen, held at the Church of the Good Shepherd. He described Alexander as a "devout, godly and respected colored woman" and consecrated her as a deaconess. She became the first and only African-American deaconess. She worked in Altamaha River area for the rest of her life, teaching not only academic subjects, but also moral values. Her Sunday School students always donated pennies to those worse off then themselves. When an earthquake devastated Tokyo-Yokohama in Japan in 1923, Alexander's mission diverted their own building funds to aid the overseas victims, donating more proportionally to assist other needy people than any other church in the diocese.
The diocese of Georgia split in 1907 and Nelson chose to associate with the new Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta. His successor in the Diocese of Georgia, Frederick Focke Reese, excluded African-Americans from church government in the diocese, and extended almost no diocesan financial support to African-Americans. This forced Alexander and others to make do, as well as seek support from outside the diocese, including from the Episcopal Board of Missions. During the bad crop years of the late 1920s through the Great Depression, Alexander continued to work in her hardscrabble community, whose members built the current wooden church building in 1928. In 1934 only 2 of the 30 students could pay the nickel per week school fee. 
Alexander became the agent for governmental and private aid for both black and white residents, and enlisted neighbors of both races to help. Before his death, Reese recognized her decades of service. During the summers of her last decade, Alexander cooked for Camp Reese, the then-new (and now former) Diocesan summer camp on St. Simons Island, and brought small groups of African-American boys and girls – who were formally barred as campers but could enjoy the area. In her later years, Alexander worked alongside other deaconesses, including Madeline Dunlap of Chicago.
Legacy.
Alexander died on September 24, 1947, and was buried at the cemetery at Camp Reese. In 1998, she was recognized as a saint by the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia and its Bishop Henry Louttit, Jr.. Her diocese began advocating for larger recognition in the Episcopal Church. In 2004, she was reinterred at Good Shepherd Church in Pennick, which she had founded and where she had worked for many years, although now visiting priests only hold services twice a month. 
The General Convention of the Episcopal Church, meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah preliminarily recognized Alexander's service as a deaconess and teacher in 2015. A short documentary released by the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia in 2018 explains her life. Also in 2018, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry visited Pennick, Georgia and recognized her ministry. She was the winner of the "Golden Halo" in Lent Madness 2018, an educational tool hosted by Forward Movement Publications featuring the saints of the calendar of the Episcopal Church. She was added to the Episcopal Church's calendar of saints that year.

Front for the Rebirth of Poland

Front for the Rebirth of Poland also translated as the Front for a Reborn Poland () was a clandestine anti-Fascist organization formed in 1941 in occupied Poland during World War II, by a group of secular Catholics of Warsaw led by Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Father Edmund Krauze. The Front upheld Christian ideals of the prewar Catholic Action movements existing in the Polish Second Republic as part of the cross national European groupings of lay Catholics.
History.
The "Front for a Reborn Poland" (FOP) published its own publication called "Prawda" (The Truth), edited by Witold Bieńkowski who took active part in the organization of Żegota in the autumn of 1942. He was put in charge of the Jewish and prisoner sections of Żegota in February 1943 on behalf of the "Delegatura". The editor-in-chief was novelist Zofia Kossak-Szczucka who, until then, co-edited another underground paper called "Polska Żyje" (Poland Lives) already since the invasion of Poland in 1939. Kossak-Szczucka, code-name 'Weronika', published her famous "Protest" in "The Truth" publication in the summer of 1942. Both Bieńkowski and Kossak-Szczucka as well as Wanda Krahelska-Filipowicz worked in Żegota as representatives from the "Front for a Reborn Poland" (FOP).

Nadia Schadlow

Nadia Catherine Schadlow (born c. 1965) is an American academic and defense-related government officer who briefly served in 2018 as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy in the Trump Administration. She is the primary author of the 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS).
Early life, education and family.
Schadlow grew up in Bedford Hills, New York. She holds a B.A. degree in government and Soviet studies from Cornell University and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University. She has three children.
Early government career.
Schadlow started as a civil servant at the Department of Defense focusing on the Soviet Union and newly independent Ukraine within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Later, she served on the Defense Policy Board from September 2006 to June 2009.
Academic career.
Schadlow is a full member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Her articles have appeared in "Parameters", "The American Interest", the "Wall Street Journal", "The Atlantic", and "Philanthropy", and she has written chapters for several edited volumes. She is author of the book, "War and the Art of Governance: Consolidating Combat Success Into Political Victory", which looks at cases in which militaries are involved in non-military governance activities.
National Security Council.
Schadlow was appointed to the National Security Council staff by long-time colleague H.R. McMaster in March 2017. Upon her appointment, journalist Thomas E. Ricks described both her and Fiona Hill, who joined the NSC at the same time, as "well-educated, skeptical, and informed..." During this time, Schadlow became the primary author of the 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS).

Weekend Special

"Weekend Special" is the debut single by the South African recording group Brenda and the Big Dudes taken from their debut studio album "Weekend Special" (1983). It was written by Melvyn Matthews, as was the B-side "Life Is Going On". Weekend Special features production by Blondie Makhene (one half of the 1970s duo Blondie &amp; Pappa) and Matthews. 
The song was released by EMI Records as a maxi single titled "Weekend Special", in February 1983. The single was successful commercially and became one of Brenda's signature songs.

Background.
In 1980, Anneline Malebo, one of the singers from the group Joy went on maternity leave. Fassie, a vocalist from Langa, Cape Town, who lived with producer Hendrick "Koloi" Lebona, was wooed by Joy's management to stand in for Malebo. Following the return of Malebo, Brenda left the band and joined Blondie and Papa [Makhene] as a backup singer before starting her own band, Brenda and the Big Dudes.
Writing And Production.
"Weekend Special" was written and produced by a Port Elizabeth based songwriter/producer Melvyn Matthews. In 1983 Matthews met his idol Blondie Makhene (one half of the duo Blondie &amp; Pappa) who invite him to an audition.

Temperament traits are known to be traits in which explain the behavior and actions of an animal and can be described in the traits responsible for how easily an animal can be approached, handled, milked, or trained. Temperament can also be defined as how an animal carries out maternal or other behaviors while subjected to routine management. These traits have the ability to change as the animal ages or as the environment in which the animal lives changes over time, however, it is proven that regardless of age and environmental conditions, some individuals remain more aggressive than others. Aggression in cattle can arise from both genetic and environmental factors.
Aggression between cows is worse than that between bulls. Bulls with horns will bunt (push or strike with the horns) in which can cause more damage overall. In humans, most aggressive behaviors of cows include kicking, crushing and/or blunting.
Types of aggression.
There are many types of aggression that are seen in animals, particularly cattle, including maternal, feed, comfort influencing, pain induced, and stress induced aggressiveness.
Maternal aggression.
There are many components to maternal behavior that are seen in cattle, including behavior that allows proper bonding between mother and baby, nursing behavior, attentiveness and how mother responds to offspring. This maternal behavior is often seen in cattle during lactation as a prey species, this triggers the maternal instinct to protect their young from any threat and may use violent aggressive behaviors as a defense mechanism. During lactation in prey species, including cattle, a reduction in fear responsiveness of the dam to novel and potentially dangerous situations facilitates the expression of defensive aggression in protection of the young. It has also been proven however that aggression is not only performed in the protection of the offspring, but it can be directed to the offspring, in which could be directly related to fear.
Feed aggression.
This is commonly seen in cattle due to high stocking densities which could potentially decrease the amount of space each cow has, as well as limit their ability to have access to feed, even impacting the ruminal environment. It is proven that supplying feed and water to cattle that are housed together may be heavily associated with feed aggression and aggressive actions towards others cows and within loose-housed cattle, feeding places are noted to have the highest amount of aggressive behaviors.
Comfort induced aggression.
These are aggressive behaviors associated with lack of comfort, inadequate lying space or time in which the physical environment fails to provide the animal. Cow comfort plays an important role in the well being as well as maximizing production as an industry. Within many intensive production systems, it is very common to see limited space for resting, which can be associated with negative behaviors as not providing the appropriate space for the animal reduces resting and lying behavior, increasing irritability and the potential to act in aggressive behaviors. Although not all production systems provide limited space and time for lying, uncomfortable stalls are also known to be a major problem when it comes to lying behavior in cattle. Decreasing the quality of resting area for cows will decrease resting time, and increase the likelihood of stress, abnormal and aggressive behaviors as the deprivation of lying/resting behaviors is proven to affect responses within the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis which is associated with chronic stress in the animal. Not only lying time and space act as important regulators of comfort induced aggression, but other environmental factors may play a role in the comfort of an animal. Temperature has been shown to be a factor that influences the behavioral interactions between cattle, and it has been found that, by providing cows with the proper cooling environment or as heat could decrease aggressive interactions as cattle will have been shown to engage in aggressive behavior in order to gain access to a shaded and cattle with access to more shade are known to show reduced physiological and behavioral responses to heat.
Stress induced aggression.
These are behaviors caused by some sort of stressor that can lead to aggressive advances towards themselves or other individuals.
A stressor is an object or event that can cause a real or perceived threat internally or externally to an animal. Stressors are common in farm animals such as dairy cows as they live in a complex environment where there are many stressors including novel objects (new objects such as handlers, food, or group mates), social stimuli (different environments, new individuals), or restraint (physical restraint, moved to cubicles, transported).
Dairy cows specifically have been known to be very sensitive to new, unfamiliar events or objects such as being around an unfamiliar person, or presented with a novel food item.
Stress has extreme negative impacts on growth and reproduction in cattle, as the pituitary-adrenal system is very sensitive to different environmental stressors such as inadequate space, feed, poor quality housing, new objects or individuals, or new living/housing system 
Pain induced aggression.
Pain is defined as an effective state and can only be truly measured indirectly in both humans and animals, that may present some challenges in decision making regarding pain management.
Many things can result in pain including dehorning, tail docking, handling, castrating, mastitis, lameness, confinement, transportation 
Lameness is a common issue seen in cattle, and may occur in facilities with poor management and housing systems, and inadequate handling skills. It is because of this issue that many cows find themselves spending a lot of time lying down, instead of engaging in both aggressive (head butting, vocalizing, pushing) and non aggressive behaviors (licking, walking) due to the pain.
Preventions.
Techniques such as low stress handling (LSH) can be used as it provides silence, adequate restraint methods can help minimize stress levels in the animals. Flight zones should be considered when handling or moving cattle, as they have a blind spot and may get spooked easily if unaware if there is an individual around. Providing environments for cows in which minimize any environmental stressor can not only improve the wellbeing and welfare of the animal, but can also reduce aggressive behaviors.
Regular examinations (physical and physiological) should be done to determine the condition of the cow, which could show signs of cuts, or lesions, as well as the secretion or hormones inside the body such as cortisol. Cortisol can be measured through blood sampling, urine, saliva or heart rate to indicate stress level of animal.
Assessing for lameness, as well as giving proper treatment depending on severity/location can include antibiotics, Using proper treatment/prevention for pain when lameness is examined, as well as procedures such as tail docking, dehorning, castrating, mastitis lameness etc.
The primary treatment in lame cows is corrective hoof pairing, which provides draining of abscesses, fixing any structural issue with the hoof, and reducing weight baring problems, however if lesions are seen in cattle, antibiotics or other measures may have to be taken to reduce further infection/irritation.
Setting breeding goals can be a potential way to select for desired temperamental traits, further decreasing the risk of raising aggressive cattle. Before this method of selection can be entirely accurate and safe, however, some tests should be done, such as behavior and temperament tests.

Inside Victor Lewis-Smith

Inside Victor Lewis-Smith is a British comedy sketch/sitcom series that ran on BBC2 from November to December 1993. It was co-written and presented by comedian and writer Victor Lewis-Smith. It ran for six episodes.
Premise.
The series was set in the Frank Bough Memorial Zip Injury Wing at St. Reith's Hospital for Distressed Broadcasters, a BBC-owned hospital. One of its residents is an apparent caricature of Lewis-Smith, who lies immobilised in a "comic coma" after a motorcycle crash.
In an attempt to stimulate his brain, the hospital staff play old BBC programmes to him via a TV monitor plugged into his life support machine - but for some unexplained reason, he also starts playing the programmes back, albeit with his warped sense of humour. This effectively makes him a one-man transmitter, which the BBC plan to use as an economical replacement for their current staff and equipment.
Meanwhile, inside Lewis-Smith's body, Lewis-Smith himself embarks on a guided tour of his own bloodstream in a miniature taxi, accompanied by an annoying taxi driver who doubles as a narrative linking device in-between sketches.
Regular sketches.
The opening to each episode involves a spoof BBC Two ident, which often involves the COW Globe ident from 1985-1991 in some way shape or form.
The I-Spy Book of....
A humorous guide on Lewis-Smith's own take on the world, presented as a visual equivalent of an I-Spy Book. Subjects include animals, fairgrounds, teenagers and the police.
Something To Cheer You Up.
Taking place during the hospital scenes, Lewis-Smith's wife brings him something to cheer him up while he's unconscious, often related to the sketch which is due to follow or has just followed. She then follows it up with an anecdote, often related to how the item came into her possession.
Kith &amp; Kin.
This sketch is a spoof documentary on the lives of two people with the same last name. Those featured were Bertrand and Jane Russell, Henry and Windy Miller, Thora and Douglas Hird (sic), Norman and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Siegfried and Vidal Sassoon, and Queen Elizabeth II and Barbara Windsor. Each sketch contains an appearance by a Melvyn Bragg expy called Mervyn Briggs.
The Secret Life of Television.
Like Kith &amp; Kin, this sketch is a spoof documentary supposedly going behind the scenes of television. Subjects include eccentrics, "The Black and White Minstrel Show", Hogmanay programmes, table tennis and interlude films. A similar sketch was previously featured in Lewis-Smith's contributions to "TV Hell".
You're The Star.
A parody of "You've Been Framed!", this sketch features clips starring Lewis-Smith's co-writer Paul Sparks and Lewis-Smith's friend David Dallison, in which they fake humorous injuries accompanied by a voiceover of Lewis-Smith's impression of Jeremy Beadle. This sketch was previously featured in Lewis-Smith's contributions to "TV Hell".
The Singing Telegram.
Played by the Square Pegs, the Singing Telegram are a barbershop quartet who sing a melody to the tune of Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby that often begins with "We're The Singing Telegram..." and is often related to the sketch due to follow or has just followed.
Mr. Lobley's Latest Invention.
Another one of the residents of St. Reith's is Mr. Lobley, who often attempts to describe to the Nurse his latest idea of an invention which he plans to complete when he leaves. Often, the Nurse isn't that impressed by the idea, so she attempts to kill or injure him in some way until the Consultant interferes. Like the Something To Cheer You Up sketches, these take place during the hospital scenes.
The Magical Voice of Frank Sinatra.
A series of spoof advertisements, advertising albums by Frank Sinatra that include songs focusing on various topics, like university dropouts, dyspepsia, feminism, the working classes and Alzheimer's.
Revenge.
This series of sketches involves Lewis-Smith mocking various musicians by dubbing over the soundtrack of their performances with his own soundtrack of badly played (on purpose) songs. Those mocked included Nigel Kennedy, James Galway, John Williams, The Swingle Singers, Julian Lloyd Webber, Roger Whittaker and Jimi Hendrix. A similar sketch was also featured in Lewis-Smith's later series "TV Offal".
The BBC Big Band's Old TV Theme Tunes.
Each episode contains a musical interlude by the BBC Big Band, who perform various classic TV show theme tunes from the Music Therapy Room in St Reith's. The theme tunes included "The Money Programme", "Nationwide", "The Saint", "The Baron", "Danger Man" and "Tomorrow's World".
My Alter Ego Must Lash Out.
The show would close with Lewis-Smith's trademark of prank calling various places, such as the Monopolies Commission, a branch of McDonald's in Moscow or the Belgian Consulate, with initial good graces, before becoming more and more rude as the conversation continued, with the credits often rolling below or beside the footage of the call.
Cast and crew.
The show also features appearances by Paul Sparks, David Dallison, Stan Harrison, Chris Langham, John Hodgkinson and Phil Hammond.

Walker attended the University of Illinois at Chicago where he earned a bachelor of arts degree. He then attended Chicago State University, where he earned his master of science degree in Criminal Justice and Corrections. In addition, Walker holds a master of science degree in Strategic Intelligence from the National Intelligence University and also a master of arts degree in International Service from American University. Walker has also attended and completed the National and International Security Program for senior executives at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the National Security Studies Program at George Washington University and the Seminar XXI Foreign Politics, International Relations and the National Interest Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Military career.
Walker was commissioned as Military Police 2nd Lieutenant assigned to the 50th Military Police Company, Somerset, New Jersey in May 1985. Since then, Walker has served as Commander, Alpha Company, 260th Military Intelligence Battalion; Commander, Land Component Command, District of Columbia Army National Guard; Chief of Staff, District of Columbia National Guard; Deputy Commander – Army, Joint Task Force, and Commander, Partnership for the Americas, Brigade Joint Task Force–Jamaica; Commander, Mobilization Augmentation Command, District of Columbia Army National Guard.
Walker was called to serve with the U.S. Army in September 2001 immediately following the September 11 attacks. He was part of Operation Noble Eagle in a non-combat role and was an operations officer in the Pentagon. He later served with the NATO International Security Assistance Force and at the Embassy of the United States, Kabul.
In April 2015, he was appointed as the Commander, Land Component Command, District of Columbia National Guard and subsequently promoted to Brigadier General in November 2015.
During the 2017 Presidential Inauguration, Walker commanded the Joint Task Force-District of Columbia (JTF-DC) which deployed nearly 8,000 National Guard personnel, from 43 states and territories, to support security, traffic control, and crowd management during the Inauguration of Donald Trump. JTF-DC supported seven, federal and D.C. agencies during the presidential inauguration. National Guard personnel helped monitor the 248 traffic, access and security points, and blocking positions along the National Mall and parade route. The support provided by National Guard personnel enabled the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia to respond to 217 arrests, and the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department to conduct 229 responses, 94 hospital transports and numerous medical tent treatments. The D.C. National Guard has supported 40 presidential inaugurations since 1861.
On January 20, 2017, Walker assumed the role of acting Commanding General, District of Columbia Army and Air National Guard, nicknamed the “Capitol Guardians”. In March 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Walker for promotion to Major General and selected him as the Commanding General.
On June 1, 2020, during an interview with CNN, Walker defended the DC National Guard by stating that DCNG troops were not involved in using force against protesters to clear Lafayette Park during George Floyd protests Walker stated that DCNG troops held their positions and never advanced on the crowd. He emphasized that the use of force concerning protesters is always a last resort.
On March 5, 2021, Walker was selected by the United States House of Representatives as the new Sergeant-At-Arms. Walker replaced Paul D. Irving, who resigned after the 2021 United States Capitol attack. This appointment made Walker the first African-American in U.S. history to serve as the Sergeant-At-Arms in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the announcement of Walker's appointment that day. Pelosi administered the Oath of Office to Walker during a House pro forma session on April 26, hours prior to President Biden's address to Congress.
Civilian service.
Walker is the former vice chairman, board of directors of the Young Marines, a military affiliated nonprofit service organization for boys and girls ages eight through high school that provides developmental programs that nurtures and encourages its over 10,000 members into becoming responsible citizens who enjoy a positive and drug-free lifestyle.
Walker retired as a Special Agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 2014 with thirty years of distinguished service in positions of increasing responsibility. Promoted to the Senior Executive Service rank in August 2002, Deputy Assistant Administrator in February 2004 and appointed a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), Senior National Intelligence Service in September 2009, his final senior executive leadership position was Director of Strategic Warning, DEA Intelligence Division.

Publius Calvisius Ruso

Publius Calvisius Ruso was a Roman senator, who was active during the Flavian dynasty. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of March-June 79 as the colleague of Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus. A shadowy and enigmatic figure, many of the facts of Ruso's life have been debated by the experts.
It is not disputed that Ruso was the son of the homonymous consul of 53. However, the existence of a Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, attested by an inscription found in Pisidian Antioch, complicates matters. At first, the consensus accepted Hermann Dessau's explanation that the two were the same man, and the inscription from Antioch merely demonstrated that Ruso had a polyonomous name, despite that the inscription also attested to a governorship of the combined province of Cappadocia-Galatia that had to be dated to the years 104 to 109. Dessau further identified this man as the husband of Dasumia, and thus great-grandfather of the emperor Marcus Aurelius.
This was the accepted consensus until the 1980s when Eric Birley published a paper wherein he voiced doubts he had for 25 years with this identification. Ronald Syme built upon Birley's arguments, and proposed that the inscription from Antioch referred to a younger half-brother of Ruso, named Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus, the ancestor of Marcus Aurelius. Syme also proposed that the younger brother, Ruso Julius Frontinus, was the son of a sister of the prominent consular, Frontinus, explaining the similarities of name. Syme also proposed that the older son, Calvisius Ruso, had married a Dasumia, basing his reasoning on the fragmentary text of the "Testamentum Dasumii"; however, subsequent research and discoveries have weakened the possibility of a connection between the individuals mentioned in that inscription and Calvisius Ruso.
That there were two sons of the consul, one the nephew of Frontinus, has since been widely accepted -- but not unanimously. Ginette Di Vita-Évrard, in a paper published a few years after Syme's, argued that our Calvisius Ruso was the one who married Frontinus' sister, and thus Ruso Julius Frontinus was his son. Based on the lack of evidence for these personages, one cannot easily decide which conclusion is closest to the truth.

Pfalztheater

The Pfalztheater is a theatre building and company in the German city of Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatine. It is the only three-genre venue in the state, putting on music, drama and dance.
The town's first theatre was built in 1862, financed by Andreas Müller, owner of the Spittelmühle in Kaiserslautern. It stood on Theaterstraße (now Karl-Marx-Straße) on the corner of Gasstraße. It was destroyed by fire a few years later and rebuilt by Müller. In 1874, the theatre was converted into a public limited company. The shares were taken over in 1897 by the town of Kaiserslautern, as a municipal theatre. It grew to the "Städtebundoper" during the first decades of the 20th century, in a cooperation with other theatres in the state, especially with Pirmasens and Zweibrücken. Productions continued there until the building was completely destroyed by bombing on 14 August 1944. Performances resumed in October 1945 at the "Capitol" cinema. When funding had been raised, the Film-Palast cinema was converted into a permanent replacement for the lost theatre, opening in September 1950.

List of Chlorophyceae genera

The Chlorophyceae are a class of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped, depending on the species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose.
This list of genera in Chlorophyceae is sub-divided by order and family. Some genera have uncertain taxonomic placement and are listed as "incertae sedis". The list is based on the data available in AlgaeBase, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) and other taxonomic databases.

Tjapartji Kanytjuri Bates

Tjapartji Kanytjuri Bates (born c. 1933 at Yinunmaru, died 2015) was an Australian Ngaanyatjarra Aboriginal artist based in Warakurna, Wanarn, and Warburton communities in the Gibson Desert. Known to be active from 1991, her work incorporates media of paint, canvas, glass and felt, and is particularly centred around interpretations of Tjukurrpa from her mother and father. Bates was a prolific artist and her work has been shown in over 20 exhibitions, as well as the National Gallery of Victoria and the National Gallery of Australia.
Art and awards.
Bates' art is focused on Tjukurrpa from her mother and father, particularly Kungarrangkalpa (Seven Sisters) and Warmarrla Tjukurrpa, and features distinctive styles of "unusual symmetries and circular motifs," as well as "traditional motifs and iconographic forms." In the early 1990s, she joined the Warburton Arts Project, which owns the "largest collection of Indigenous art in Australia that is held by Aboriginal people themselves", where she produced her first known work, "Kungkarrangkalpa at Wanarn", in 1991. In 1998, Bates was awarded the Normandy Heritage Art Prize at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. In the late 1990s, Bates returned to Wanarn and continued to paint. Near the end of her life, she became a resident at the Wanarn Aged Care Facility, which offers a weekly painting program in conjunction with the Warakurna Arts Centre. Her style at this time became looser and more abstract. In addition to work produced through this program, Bates also painted on the materials around her at the facility, including pieces of cardboard and pillowcases.
Bates' works, including these later works, were displayed posthumously as part of "Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters", a collaborative exhibition between senior custodians of Aboriginal lands in the Central and Western deserts and the National Museum of Australia, among other partners. Bates' work in the exhibition (which ran from September 2017 to February 2018) illustrates and interprets Seven Sisters songlines.
Exhibitions.
The following is a list of exhibitions of Bates' works, from shortstgallery.com.au.
Bates' work is also a part of the National Gallery of Victoria Collection, the Marshall Collection, the Merenda Collection, the Lagerberg-Swift Collection, the National Gallery of Australia Collection, the Harriet and Richard England Collection, the Lepley Collection and the W. &amp; V.

F. J. Botting

Francis Joseph Botting (1819 – 10 July 1906), generally known as F. J. Botting was an auctioneer in Adelaide, South Australia, who became an owner of several important hotels and breweries. His son, Frank South Botting (c. 1849 – 12 November 1894), was a partner.
History.
Francis Joseph Botting was born in London and trained as a builder. He emigrated to South Australia aboard Buckinghamshire arriving in March 1839. He joined with his brother Frederick Henry Botting (c. 1810 – 1873) in constructing some of Adelaide's earliest buildings, including a merchant's office and warehouse, which later became the Blenheim Hotel, and the first wharf and wharf building in Port Adelaide, under architect Prescott.
The two brothers lived on the islands of Spencer's Gulf 1844–1846 during the financial slump.
Auctioneer.
In May 1856 Botting joined Wicksteed, Townsend &amp; Co., auctioneers, (John Bentham Neales, Frederic Wicksteed and William Townsend), which became Wicksteed, Botting, Townsend &amp; Co., then Townsend, Wicksteed &amp; Kay with just those two and William Kay.
Kay dropped out of the partnership in 1869, then the firm of Townsend, Botting &amp; Co. was dissolved in August 1880, and all assets liquidated; Botting continuing with the business with the assistance of his son-in-law G. E. C. Stevens.
Brewers and hotel owners.
In 1874 Frank Botting and Frederick Estcourt Bucknall purchased the brewing and hotel-owning firm of Haussen &amp; Co. from Henry Haussen's widow, retaining the name Haussen &amp; Co. 
Bucknall lost most of his fortune with the failure of the Commercial Bank of South Australia in 1886, and Botting and his father took over the business.
Frank Botting died in November 1894, and his father became sole proprietor.
At some stage the Bottings acquired the Pier Hotel, Glenelg and the Family Hotel, Glenelg.
Other interests.
Botting died at his home on Kensington Terrace, Kensington. His remains were interred at the West Terrace Cemetery.

Hugh Joicey, 3rd Baron Joicey

Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Edward Joicey, 3rd Baron Joicey (1881–1966), known as the Hon. Hugh Joicey until 1940, was a British Army officer, businessman and peer.
Career.
Joicey was the second son of the coal mining magnate and Liberal Party politician James Joicey from Durham. His father was created a Baronet in 1893, and then elevated to the peerage as Baron Joicey in 1906. His elder brother James Arthur Joicey (1880–1940) succeeded to the peerage on their father's death in 1936, but left only three surviving daughters on his own death four years later, when Hugh Edward succeeded. With the inheritance came the family seat at Etal Manor on the Ford Castle and Etal Castle estate.
Joicey was commissioned into the 14th Hussars as a second-lieutenant on 3 October 1900, and served in the Second Boer War in South Africa in 1901. After the war had ended, he was promoted to lieutenant on 27 August 1902. He later served with the 1st battalion Suffolk Regiment in the First World War, gaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1933.
Family.
Joicey married in 1921 Lady Joan Katherine Lambton (1893–1967), youngest daughter of Frederick Lambton, 4th Earl of Durham. They had two sons:

Eric Tillinghast

Eric Tillinghast is an American contemporary artist based in Los Angeles. He has worked with water as a sculptural material since 1994. After attending art school in Sweden, Tillinghast began his art career in California where he created charcoal drawings. These drawings became increasingly minimal and geometric. The carefully developed detail seen in these earliest works carries over to the precision and attention to detail seen in his metal works. His works can be found in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery, the John Michael Kohler Art Center in Wisconsin, the Museum of Fine Art in Santa Fe, Portland State University, and the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona.
Background.
Tillinghast began making geometric box-like constructions that initially appeared as singular objects but later incorporated water. His focus was no longer just with space and line, but also light and liquid. This has resulted in an ongoing series of sculptures, installations, paintings, and projects in which water is the primary subject and medium. Tillinghast has created site specific fountains, wishing wells, and rain machines that explore the social, civic, and pedestrian relationships that people and communities have with water. His work also explores the history every culture has around the meaning of water. His small paintings on paper created with found vintage postcards of various bodies of water embody post-modernist deconstruction, found-object art, vernacular photography, and minimalism.
Tillinghast has created two fountain installations for the Life is Beautiful Festival in Las Vegas. His work has been exhibited at The Galerie der Stadt Mainz Bruckenturm in Mainz, Rocket in London, P.S. in Amsterdam, and The Center For Contemporary Non-Objective Art in Brussels. His work can be found in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery, the John Michael Kohler Art Center in Wisconsin, the Museum of Fine Art in Santa Fe, Portland State University, and the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona among others.

John P. Young

John Philip Young (August 9, 1849 – April 23, 1921) was an American newsman and writer. He was managing editor of the "San Francisco Chronicle" for 44 years, and wrote variously on history, economics, and journalism. His books include the two-volume "San Francisco: A History of the Pacific Coast Metropolis" (1913), and "Journalism in California" (1915). He was also a founding member and treasurer of the Commonwealth Club of California.
Young was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and at age 16 ran away from home and enlisted in the Navy. His parents organized his release while he was on his first cruise, and he then spent four years working in a Philadelphia store. He then moved out west, first to Arizona, then San Diego, where he became business manager and later an editor of the "San Diego Union". In 1873 he went to Washington, D.C. for four years, where he was city editor of the "Washington Chronicle". He moved back to California in 1877, joining the "Chronicle" in April of that year. After covering the 1877–78 session of the California legislature for the "Chronicle", he was appointed managing editor.
He authored several books and articles on economics, history, and journalism. He was an ardent supporter of American protectionism, which he explored in his 1899 book "Protection and Progress", and in 1904 was elected an honorary member of the American Protective Tariff League. Other works include a two-volume history of San Francisco, and "The Growth of Modern Trusts", the latter praised by president Theodore Roosevelt as performing a genuine service to the country. He was also an advocate of bimetallism in the debate against monometallism, and in 1895 published in the pages of the "Chronicle" his "Bimetallism and Monometallism" , a 25-chapter, 63-column exploration of the issue, an amount of space noted by a British magazine as "probably unprecedented in newspaper literature."
In 1884 he married Georgina M. Brown of St. Louis. He died at the age of 71 on April 23, 1921, at his home in San Francisco, after suffering a stroke of paralysis 10 days earlier.

Jan van Ours

Jan C. van Ours (born in Stellendam in 1954) is a Dutch economist and currently Professor of Applied Economics at the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR). He belongs to the most highly cited economists in the Netherlands and is the 1996 winner of the Hicks-Tinbergen Award (together with Geert Ridder).
Biography.
A native of Stellendam, Jan van Ours earned a Master's degree in mining engineering from the Delft University of Technology in 1977, but subsequently changed his studies to economics, wherein he earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) in 1982 and 1986. Already in 1977, van Ours became member of the Scientific Council for Government Policy (1978–83), followed by an appointment to the Organisation for Labour Market Research (1983–88). In 1988, van Ours became an associate professor in economics at the Free University of Amsterdam (1988–94) before returning to Rotterdam as full professor in 1994. During his first tenure at EUR (1994–97), he also served as director of the Tinbergen Institute. In 1998, van Ours became Professor of Labor Economics at Tilburg University (1998-2016), where he also intermittently led the Department of Economics (1999-2000) and directed the Centre for Economic Research (CentER) (2001). Finally, in 2016, Jan van Ours returned to EUR, where he was appointed as Professor of Applied Economics.
Van Ours maintains professional affiliations with the Tinbergen Institute, CESifo, Centre for Economic Policy Research, Centre for Research and Economic Analysis on Migration, and the IZA Institute of Labor Economics. Moreover, he is a fellow of the European Association of Labour Economists, whose president he was from 2011 to 2014, and presided also over the European Society for Population Economics (2009). He also has been a member of the Central Planning Bureau of the Netherlands since 2014. Finally, Jan van Ours performs editorial duties at the academic reviews "De Economist", "Labour Economics" and "Journal of the Economics of Aging" and has done so in the past for "IZA World of Labor", "Economic Policy", "Journal of the European Economic Association", and the "European Economic Review".
Research.
Jan van Ours' research focuses on labour economics and other applied economic topics. In particular, he has conducted substantial research on how labour market institutions affect employers and workers if labour markets aren't perfectly competitive (with Tito Boeri). According to IDEAS/RePEc, he belongs to the top 1% of economists in terms of research output.
Research on job search and job matching.
In the 1990s, Jan van Ours has conducted extensive research on the topics of job search and job matching. Together with Geert Ridder, he finds that most vacancies are filled from a pool of job searchers shortly after the vacancy's posting, implying that vacancy durations reflect the duration of employers' selection process rather than applicants' search periods. Importantly, this pool not only includes unemployed but also employed job searchers, though less educated and higher educated job searchers don't tend to compete for the same jobs. Moreover, with Martin Lindeboom and Gusta Renes, van Ours finds important differences between the effectiveness of search channels: whereas employment offices are effective in matching unemployed workers, advertisements are effective for employed workers, and informal search channels are effective in both cases. Finally, comparing labour and job turnover, van Ours, Daniel Hamermesh and Wolter Hassink find that most mobility is not to new nor from destroyed jobs but rather into and out of existing jobs, firms with declining employment hire a lot and firms with expanding employment fire a lot, worker turnover is much larger than job turnover, and simultaneous hiring and firing exists.
Research on unemployment benefits, unemployment insurance and active labour market programmes.
Another area of van Ours' research are the economics of unemployment insurance, benefits and active labour market policies. In the Netherlands, van Ours, Gerard van den Berg and Jaap Abbring find that reductions of unemployed persons' benefits for failing to meet search requirements are effective in raising individual re-employment rates. This finding is also substantiated by van Ours' research with Rafael Lalive and Josef Zweimüller on Switzerland, wherein warnings and enforcement are found to increase unemployment outflows both towards employment and out-of-the labour force and actual benefit reductions lower the quality of post-unemployment jobs in terms of duration and earnings. Moreover, stricter monitoring of eligibility requirements reduces the unemployment durations of the non-sanctioned as well as their earnings. Further research by van Ours with Lalive and Zweimüller on Austria has highlighted the role of behavioural responses by the unemployed to changes in their financial incentives, e.g. increases in unemployment durations in response to higher benefit replacement rates. Additionally, research with Milan Vodopivec on Slovenia also finds that reducing the potential duration of unemployment benefits increases unemployment outflows but doesn't affect the quality of job matches in terms of wages, contract type or match duration.
Analysing the impact of ALMPs in Switzerland, van Ours, Lalive and Zweimüller find some evidence that temporary subsidised job may reduce unemployment duration, whereas training and employment programmes don't. By contrast, van Ours and Graversen find mandatory activation programmes in Denmark to be very effective with regard to reducing unemployment duration, possibly because more intensive contacts between the unemployed and public placement services. Finally, van Ours and Jan Boone find evidence suggesting that labour market training is effective in reducing unemployment, whereas public employment services and job subsidization aren't.
Research on unemployment, part-time work, education, age and employment protection.
Other research on labour economics by van Ours has dealt with topics such as the relationship between unemployment, part-time work, education, age, employment protection. Analysing the relationship between unemployment, labour market institutions and labour market reforms with Michèle Belot, van Ours show that particular combinations of labour market institutions are effective in terms of lowering unemployment rates. Investigating the effects of working hours on satisfaction with Alison Booth, van Ours finds that neither men's nor women's life satisfaction is affected by their hours of work, though men's hours-of-work satisfaction is highest for full-time jobs and that of women is highest for part-time jobs of any size, in line with theories linking family happiness with work patterns conforming to traditional gender identities.
 In research with Lenny Stoeldraijer, van Ours finds no evidence of an age related pay-productivity gap in Dutch manufacturing. Studying the educational attainment of second-generation immigrants in the Netherlands together with Justus Veenman, they conclude that differences in the level of education of their parents are driving the differences in educational attainment between second-generation immigrants and native Dutch people. Finally, another important research finding of van Ours' work with Belot and Boone is that employment protection may be welfare-improving, though the optimal level of employment protection is mediated by labour market features such as workers' relative bargaining power and wage rigidities (e.g. minimum wages).

Cynthia Gómez

Cynthia Ann Gómez (b. 1958) is an American psychologist who works in public health. She is known for her work in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention, health care access and health equity for minority individuals and committees. Likewise, one of her most major accomplishments was being the founding director of the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University. She has been a teacher and researcher, as well as a leader in both teaching and governmental positions.
Life and education.
Cynthia Gómez is a third generation Mexican American. She was born in Long Beach, California, on September 9, 1958. Her parents, Lilly Gonzales and Augustine U. Gómez, are both of Mexican descent. She moved to a small village in Ecuador at the age of six because of her father's job at a tuna cannery, where she learned how to speak Spanish, and then later lived in Puerto Rico from 1968 to 1975. Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she received her B.A. in psychology from Boston University in 1979. She then also received her Master of Education degree (Ed.M.) in Counseling and Consulting Psychology at Harvard University in 1982 and then her PhD in Clinical Psychology at Boston University in 1990. In 1991, she then moved to San Francisco to work as a researcher at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California at San Francisco, the city where she currently resides today. She is bilingual as she speaks both Spanish and English, and has a Puerto Rican accent which she says is a source of confusion for people. She has been known to utilize her Latina background to be a leader and role model for the students she teaches as well as her colleagues. Her leadership skills have been noted by National AIDS Fund president and CEO Kandy Ferree.
She started her career with the idea of becoming a child psychologist but later moved to public health, with a strong focus on equal opportunity and championing disadvantaged groups due to her Latina heritage. She has advocated for the improvement of health for these underserved groups, which include imprisoned women, gay men, lesbian women, and people of color, in ways such as contacting and advising groups that work to help them. One such group included a community health center in Boston that Gómez worked with during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic which provided care for these underserved groups.
Work and service.
Before starting her work in HIV, Gómez worked in community health settings for 12 years. This included being the director of the Children's Mental Health Services of the Southern Jamaica Plain Health Center in Boston. Other positions she held in community settings included her first professional job at the Upham's Corner Health center as a community outreach worker and mental health counselor, as well as being a psychology intern at the Cambridge Child Guidance Center, a psychotherapist and mobile crisis team therapist at the AtlantiCare Medical Center, and also a clinical psychology fellow at the Harvard Medical School Massachusetts Mental Health Center. These positions were all in Massachusetts, many of which were in the Boston area.
She has numerous awards from American Psychological Association (APA), notably the 2016 APA Presidential Citation, and Distinguished Contribution to Ethnic Minority Issues Award from APA Div. 44 (Society for the Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity). This award, given every year to psychologists for their extraordinary work, was given to Gómez for her work on HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as for advocating for underserved groups and communities when it comes to healthcare.
Gómez has served on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS under both the WJ Clinton and GW Bush administrations; the Center of Disease Control and Prevention's HIV and STD Advisory Council; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Advisory Committee on Women's Services; and the Institute of Medicine's Committees on Prisoners and Research, and on Lesbian Health. Furthermore, she also was part of the first California Public Health Advisory Council and the first California Office of Health Equity Advisory Committee, in 2007 and 2013 respectively. She was appointed to the CA Public Health Advisory Council by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the state's governor at the time. Gómez served on the American Psychological Association Committee on Psychology and AIDS and on the Board of Professional Affairs.
In 1997, after her time working as a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, she began working there as an assistant professor at the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), and in 2002 became the co-director of CAPS until she left in 2006 to create the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University. Over time, Gómez has also written and co-written numerous scholarly papers and has given many presentations all over the world regarding problems dealing with HIV and AIDS, women's health and health equity.
Health Equity Institute.
Gómez founded the Health Equity Institute at San Francisco State University in 2006. Her work has focused on gender, culture and sexual health, the development of prevention interventions and the application of science to community practice. The organization's guiding principles are: equality and justice framework; multi-disciplinary approaches; community-scientist collaboration; and translational, implementation and effectiveness research.  
The organization seeks to eliminate the preventable disparities in health, especially those caused by political carelessness and socioeconomic status. Likewise, Dr. Gómez and the rest of the organization utilize psychology, anthropology, biology, sociology, media, medicine, political policy, economics, and ethics in order to study the mechanisms that lead to inequalities and injustice in order to help people cope with those risks and lobby for political policies beneficial for social justice. By working with communities, health departments, institutions, and scientist the studies yield more complete answers to complicated issues. Lastly, Dr. Gómez focuses on closing the gap between just prevention techniques and effective, well established treatment practices.
Projects that the organization tackles include adding a community garden program to a local elementary school in a predominantly black neighborhood. This way the children can have fresh fruits and vegetables that they are lacking.

Dale Tillery

Dale B. Tillery (born February 17, 1957) is an American judge, politician, and lawyer and currently serves as the judge of the 134th Judicial District Court in Dallas County. He was first elected to the bench in 2010.
Political career.
Tillery was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1994 to replace the retiring Al Granoff. During his freshman term, his interests were focused on juvenile crime and public education; he passed legislation to help police departments crack down on gang activity. His interests also included pensions and investments; during his final term, he served as chairman on the House Committee on Pensions and Investments. As chairman, he sponsored legislation to tap a then-$6.5 billion surplus in the state teachers’ pension fund to increase pensions for retired teachers by up to 10 percent. The legislation increased the retirement multiplier to achieve the increases. Supporters of the legislation noted that it was necessary to increase the retirement “maintain[] a rough parity” between older and newer retirees because “older retirees … worked for extremely low wages in the 1960s or 1970s[.]” Teacher pensions have not been adjusted for inflation since 2001.
Tillery authored the 2001 amendment to the Texas Constitution to "require the governor to call a special legislative session to appoint presidential electors if the governor thought that a final determination of the Texas vote wouldn't be made before the federal deadline for certifying electors.” The amendment was authored in response to the uncertainty over the counting of Florida's electoral votes in the 2000 Presidential election, including whether the state legislature was authorized to appoint a slate of electors if the counting was not completed before the deadline for the electors to meet. Tillery said his measure resolved that legal uncertainty and “ensure[d] that Texans will appoint Texas presidential electors, not the United States Congress." The amendment was adopted by 62 percent of Texas voters voting in the constitutional amendments election.
He did not seek re-election in 2002; the GOP-led Legislative Redistricting Board paired him with fellow Democrat Terri Hodge.
Judicial career.
After serving in the Legislature, Tillery practice law privately in Dallas. In 2010, he won the Democratic nomination for judge of the 134th District Court for Dallas County in a runoff over former judge David Kelton. He won the general election that fall and took office Jan. 1, 2011.
As a judge, Tillery has presided over several high-profile cases in Dallas County. He was the judge presiding in the lawsuit filed by former exotic dancer Jana Weckerly against Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones that ended in a sealed settlement. He also presided over the multi-million dollar litigation between a Dallas hedge fund and Credit Suisse over the bankrupt Lake Las Vegas development; after a jury found Credit Suisse fraudulently inflated property appraisals in the development and awarded the hedge fund $40 million, Tillery ordered the financial services company to pay an $211.9 million in damages and restitution and $75.6 million in prejudgment damages and interest as penalty for the fraud. Tillery's order was upheld on appeal.
Tillery is certified as a specialist in Civil Trial Law and Personal Injury Trial Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.

2013 Bandung mayoral election

A mayoral election was held in Bandung on 23 June 2013, in order to elect the mayor of Bandung for a five-year term between 2013 and 2018. It was the second direct mayoral election in the city's history. Eight candidates vied for the mayoral seat, four of which are not backed by any political parties. Incumbent mayor Dada Rosada did not participate, having served two full terms as mayor.
The election followed a first past the post system, in which the winner might have only a plurality of the votes. Architect Ridwan Kamil won the election with about 45 percent of the votes - over double the nearest competitor.
Timeline.
Independent candidates were required to submit proof of popular support between 10 and 14 February 2013, with party-backed candidates being allocated a week between 11 and 17 March in order to register. The campaign period was officially set to be between 6 and 19 June, with the voting process taking place on 23 June.
There were 4,119 ballot locations accommodating 1,658,808 eligible voters. According to Law No. 12 of 2008 on regional governance, a second-round election is required if the winning candidate earns less than 30 percent of the votes. If that was the case, the second round voting would be held on 24 August, with the final winner being officially made mayor on 16 September.
Issues.
Due to rapid urbanization, Bandung encountered problems such as economic and social inequality, corruption, traffic jams and environmental degradation. The candidates held a public debate in June, during which multiple incidents of provocative speech was done by supporters. Following the debates, an observer from Padjadjaran University remarked that "only two pairs are actually qualified to lead Bandung" and that the others were just "trying their luck", although he did not specify which.
Results.
Early exit polls were in favor of Ridwan-Oded's victory, with a turnout of about 57 percent. Chief of the local KPU noted the low turnout, stating that he was "disappointed".
There were also 43,494 votes which were invalidated due to the ballot paper not being used or used more than once. On 28 June, Ridwan Kamil-Oded M Danial were declared winners of the election, having won in all 30 subdistricts ("kecamatan") of the city. Following the announcement, six of the seven other candidate pairs (i.e. all except Iswara-Asep) objected to the result, citing irregularities in the election process. The objections were raised to the Constitutional Court on 2 July, and on 23 July the court upheld the election results. Ridwan was formally sworn in as mayor on 16 September, as scheduled.
Analysis.
Observers noted the presence of Ridwan Kamil and his campaign team on social media, especially Twitter, as a contributing factor to his victory. Other candidates were also associated with corruption cases. Despite PKS being embroiled in a scandal during the election period, Ridwan's strong figure was postulated to have overshadowed this.

Maria Skyllas-Kazacos

Maria Skyllas-Kazacos AM FTSE (born 26 October 1951) is an Australian chemical engineer best known for her pioneering work of the vanadium redox battery, which she created at the University of New South Wales in the 1980s. Her design used sulfuric acid electrolytes and was patented by the university. In 1999 she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia "for service to science and technology, particularly in the development of the vanadium redox battery as an alternative power source".
She is an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales.
Early life.
Skyllas-Kazacos was born as Maria Skyllas in Kalymnos, Greece, in 1951 and emigrated to Australia in 1954. She is the oldest of four siblings. She attended Fort Street Girls High School in Sydney, before beginning a degree in industrial chemistry at the University of New South Wales. She graduated with first class honours and the University Medal in 1974.
She completed her PhD in 1978 at the UNSW School of Chemical Technology on the topic of the electrochemistry of molten salts.
Career.
After finishing her PhD, Skyllas received a CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship and joined Bell Laboratories in the US for her post-doctoral work.
While completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Bell Labs, Skyllas did research on solar energy and focused on the liquid junction solar cell. She researched ways of depositing thin films. She received a patent for a new method of electrodepositing thin films of cadmium selenide. Since Bell labs had to service Bell Telephone Company, Skyllas also did work on batteries. While assisting on experiments with a problem of lead-acid batteries, she discovered soluble lead(IV) ions in the charging and discharging reactions of the lead-acid batteries. She published a paper on this discovery in the "Journal of the Electrochemical Society". After giving a poster presentation in Australia on the same subject, she was awarded the Bloom-Gutmann Prize for the best young author under 30.
After leaving Bell Labs, Skyllas went back to Australia and accepted a position as a Queen Elizabeth II Fellow in the School of Physics at the University of New South Wales. In 1982, aged 31, she became a professor in chemical engineering and industrial chemistry. Skyllas married Michael Kazacos, who is also a scientist, and they have three children.
At the University of New South Wales, Skyllas-Kazacos and her research team began working on vanadium compounds. She discovered that highly concentrated pentavalent solutions can be prepared indirectly from tetravalent ions, which is more soluble, combined with scraping of the carbon electrode that made the vanadium oxidation-reduction reactions reversible. Skyllas with her research team then patented the vanadium redox battery in 1988.

The Fenyr SuperSport is a Lebanese limited production sports car built by W Motors, a United Arab Emirates based company. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dubai Motor Show. The name of the car, Fenyr, comes from the word Fenrir, the name of a monstrous wolf in Norse mythology. The production of the car was originally planned to be up to 25 units per year, a drastic increase from the limited 7-car total production run of its predecessor. However, this was later changed to a total of 100 vehicles (and 10 launch editions).
Specifications.
Powertrain.
The Fenyr SuperSport is powered by a 3.8 litre twin-turbocharged flat-six engine developed by Ruf Automobile, having a maximum power output of at 7,100 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine has mid-rear mounted position.
Transmission.
The Fenyr SuperSport is equipped with Porsche's 7-speed dual-clutch PDK transmission. The transmission is paired with a limited-slip differential and is mounted transversely at the rear of the vehicle transferring power to the rear wheels.
Suspension.
The Fenyr SuperSport utilises MacPherson strut suspension on the front axle, and multi-link suspension with horizontal coil over shock absorbers at the rear axle. Anti-roll bars are also installed at both axles.
Wheels and tyres.
The Fenyr SuperSport is equipped with forged aluminum wheels with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear. The car utilises Pirelli P Zero tyres having codes of 255/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes have ventilated ceramic composite discs, with a diameter of each and utilising six-piston aluminium callipers at the front and rear.

Alternative for Sweden

Alternative for Sweden (, AfS) is a right-wing populist political party in Sweden. It was founded in March 2018. The party was founded by Gustav Kasselstrand and William Hahne.
Alternative for Sweden was founded by members of the Sweden Democrat Youth, who were collectively expelled from the Sweden Democrats in 2015. As its primary questions, it advocates forced repatriation of one million immigrants and Swedish withdrawal from the European Union.
AfS ran in the Swedish general election in 2018, but failed to enter the Riksdag. With 0.31% of the vote, AfS is the second largest party without representation in the Riksdag. In the 2019 European Parliament election in Sweden the party ran on an anti-EU platform, receiving 0.49% of the vote. In November 2020 AfS announced their intention to run in the 2021 election to the Church of Sweden council. They won 1.24% of the votes giving them 3 seats in the Church council.
History.
Background.
In early April 2015, the Sweden Democrats (SD) accused its youth league, the Sweden Democrat Youth (SDU), of having relations with the Far-right and Ethnonationalist organization Nordic Youth (Swedish: "Nordisk Ungdom"). In response to these alleged relations, SD threatened to expel several leading members of SDU. SDU's leader Gustav Kasselstrand, and its deputy leader William Hahne, were eventually expelled from the party on 27 April 2015. They both denied the accusations of relations with extremist groups, and claimed that SD's parliamentary group leader Mattias Karlsson wanted to get rid of them after Hahne defeated the leadership's preferred candidate for the SD chairmanship in Stockholm.
Following the initial expulsion of the youth wing's chairman and deputy chairman, the mother party launched its own leadership candidate to compete against Jessica Ohlson, who was considered an ally of Kasselstrand and Hahne, and warned that the party would break all ties with SDU if Ohlson were to be elected chairman. On September 12, 2015, Ohlson defeated the party's preferred candidate for the SDU chairmanship, and the party shut down SDU's website and broke all relations with its youth wing. It then established a new youth organization, "Ungsvenskarna" (Young Swedes) and announced that every SD member who remained a member of SDU would be expelled. Ohlson herself was officially expelled alongside five other SDU members on October 25, but continued to serve as chairman of SDU, which went on to become an independent organization.
Founding and defections.
In early 2017, Sveriges Radio reported that SDU members had filed a party registration application to the election authority. The party was eventually registered on December 13, 2017, with Kasselstrand, Hahne and Ohlson in central positions. It was then officially launched on March 5, 2018; at the same time, it announced that it would participate in the 2018 elections. At the time of the launch, the party was described as drawing inspiration from Alternative for Germany, the Freedom Party of Austria and the French National Rally.
Two Sweden Democrat members of the Riksdag, Olle Felten and Jeff Ahl, defected to the party later that month. According to the rules of the Riksdag, Felten and Ahl are considered independent MP's, meaning that Alternative for Sweden is not officially represented in the parliament. Mikael Jansson, former leader of the Sweden Democrats, also defected on April 9, citing the mother party's recent lack of resistance to NATO as his main reason.
Before the 2018 elections the party was one of the largest in terms of social media interactions and expected to enter the parliament after the elections, with leader Gustav Kasselstrand asking people on Twitter to prepare for "Sweden's biggest political earthquake in modern times". However, the party failed to enter parliament by a large margin, receiving just 0.31 out of the 4.0 percent needed to get past the election threshold. On election night, the party was reported to have been kicked out of the Persian restaurant it had rented to celebrate the election results. It did not participate in the municipal elections.
Since 2018.
After the 2018 election, the party participated in the 2019 election for the European Parliament, but failed to gain a seat.
In March 2020, the party's deputy chairman and founding member William Hahne resigned from his position, after he had been revealed by Expressen to run a webshop selling surgical masks for a price 759% higher than other commercial sellers of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ideology and policies.
On its website, Alternative for Sweden lists three key issues:
It is critical of the current political establishment which it accuses of being naive and overly politically correct. Alternative for Sweden accuses "the Left" of hijacking societal institutions to rewrite history.
Unlike the Sweden Democrats, Alternative for Sweden is non-interventionist and displays hard Euroscepticism which it considers the European Union a threat to Sweden's independence and seek to call for the country to leave the EU. It also seeks to rearm the military and form a Nordic defense alliance, instead of making Sweden dependent on NATO. It wishes to restrict welfare benefits to Swedish citizens, shift from progressive to flat income tax, replace the differentiated VAT rates with a fixed rate, re-nationalise all schools, and combat the idea of a cashless society. AfS also wishes to make the country self-sufficient and end the use of fossil fuels, citing both environmental protection and national security reasons.
AfS has been described as right-wing, far-right and right-wing populist by "Svenska Dagbladet", while "Dagens Nyheter" has described the party as nationalist and right-wing populist. "Bloomberg News" has described the party as social conservative and far-right. The ideology of the party has also been described as close to the identitarian and alt-right movements. During the 2019 European Parliament election party leader Kasselstrand was endorsed by the far-right European party Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF) on Facebook. The party is affiliated with Identity and Democracy.

Basilica of Saint Severinus of Bordeaux

The Basilica of Saint Severinus (or Basilique Saint-Seurin de Bordeaux, in French) is a church built in Bordeaux at the dawn of the 11th century.
In 1998, UNESCO designated the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France as a World Heritage site, including the three main churches of Bordeaux : the basilica of St. Severinus, the basilica of St Michael and the St. Andrew's cathedral.
History.
Ancient origins.
The basilica is built upon a Christian necropolis dating to the 4th century CE. The epitaph of Flavinus was engraved beneath a representation of a chrism on the lid of a sarcophagus dating to between 365 and 385 CE, testifying to the Christian presence in Bordeaux to Late Antiquity. This epitaph was extracted during an excavation of the necropolis in 1909. Today, it is housed in the Museum of Aquitaine in Bordeaux.
Foundation legends.
Named after the fourth bishop and patron saint of Bordeaux, the history of the basilica begins with the founding of the Abbey of Saint Severinus in the 4th century CE.
Saint Severinus, born in the Levant, arrived in Bordeaux in the 4th century CE and met Bishop Amandus. Gregory of Tours tells the story in his work "In Gloria Confessorum": "the Bishop Amandus who governs the church of Bordeaux has a dream one night in which the Lord says to him, 'Lift up and go meet my servant Severin...', and now Saint Severin was coming to meet him. Approaching one another, they greeted each other by name, threw themselves in each other's arms, prayed, kissed and entered the church singing psalms". "Thus Severinus became bishop of Bordeaux".
Another legend involving the basilica is that of the Oliphant of Roland (nephew to Charlemagne and famous for his death at Roncevaux) being placed on the altar by the emperor while carrying the remains of the valiant knight. The famous Song of Roland recounts this: "Vint a Burdeles, la citet de... Desur l’alter seint Sevrin le baron Met l’oliphan plein d’or e de manguns: Li pelerin le veient ki la vunt". A Great Step in the Way of Compostela in the Middle Ages, the pilgrims are invited to pass by Saint Severinus to contemplate this relic.
Architecture.
Mid-5th century.
Despite the legends surrounding the founding of the church, the presence of an early religious building is attested to in the mid 5th century CE. It was probably a temple or an oratory. It disappeared in the 9th century due to Viking invasions.
11th–13th centuries.
At the beginning of the 11th century, the canons of the basilica decided to commence a major reconstruction. It has the shape of a robust Romanesque church in the basilical form. Frequented by pilgrims on the Ways of Saint James of Compostela, the canons led the travelers up to the choir and down into the crypt so that they could see them. During this period, the basilica was the scene of an investiture ceremony consecrating access to power over the County of Bordeaux, especially by the Dukes of Aquitaine.
During the course of the 11th through 13th centuries the nave and the choir were built. In the 13th century, the canons ordered the construction of the southern entry which is surmounted by a porch with a belfry built in the Renaissance style. They also built a monumental Gothic entrance for the necropolis. The entrance consists of a large bay flanked by two blind arches and is decorated with fourteen carved statues representing the twelve apostles and two female statues representing the Synagogue and the Church. The church has three tympana: the main one is decorated with scenes from the Resurrection and the Judgement; the left has a representation of the holy women who visited the tomb; and the right depicts the arrival of Saint Severinus according to Saint Amand's dream. The five-sided porch that leads to it was built later.
14th–18th centuries.
The 14th and 15th centuries mark the construction of several chapels. One of them was the Chapel of Madonna of the Rose which was dedicated to the Virgin. It contains an altar that was consecrated by Archbishop Pey Berland in 1444. It was designed in the flamboyant Gothic architecture reminiscent of that found in late-15th-century Normandy and England.
Twice in 1566 and 1698, parts of the church's vault structure collapsed causing serious damage. At the beginning of the 18th century, the architect Jean-Baptiste Augier was charged with rebuilding and bracing them with pillars equipped with stone belt courses. During this repair, he ordered that the floor be backfilled because of its considerable unevenness (nearly three meters). These repairs led to the burial of the crypt and a major modification of the ground of the western porch which dated to the 11th century.
19th century.
Though the Basilica of Saint Severinus was spared during the French Revolution, it was headed for a century of profound changes in the 1800s.
In the late 1820s, the western façade was restored by order of the Saint Severinus Building Council. To accomplish this the council hired architect Pierre-Alexandre Poitevin to create a neo-Romanesque façade. The construction of the porch gate hides the Romanesque porch.
Sculptor Dominique Fortuné Maggesi (1801-1892), an artist from Carrara who would go one to the greatest sculptor in the history of Bordeaux, was chosen to decorate the façade. He adorned the entrance with statues of Saint Severinus and Saint Amand whose encounter is depicted on the tympanum.He also carved statues of Saint John and Saint Peter which adorn the balustrade on the upper floor. This was done to give homogeneity to both the façade and Romanesque bell tower of the basilica.
In 1840, the Basilica of Saint Severinus was listed in the Inventory of Historic Monuments (). Following this classification, its choir was completely reorganized and a new marble altar was made.. Arcades were opened and two chapels were dedicated: one to Saint Fort and other one to the Sacred Heart. They were built on the north side of the basilica. The painter and glassmaker Joseph Villiet signed the stained glass windows of the nave that he created which depict scenes from the bible as well as the history and legends that surround the basilica.
20th century.
After it was classified as an historic monument on the List of 1840, it was then inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 due to it being the head of one of the Ways of Saint James of Compostela.
Medieval furnishings.
Like many churches, the Basilica of Saint Severinus was largely stripped of its medieval furnishings. Despite this, some elements remain such as a number of alabaster altar pieces from the 15th century. One of them, dedicated to the life of the Virgin, remains in the Chapel of the Madonna of the Rose. Another is the one at the main altar which depicts the story of Saint Severinus and the legend of the Staff of Saint Martial.
The church has also retained an ornate 15th-century episcopal pulpit that still has its armrests, backrest and dais. This is a very significant item as it is reserved for the new archbishop of Bordeaux who must take an oath on the relics of Saint Severinus before he is nominated.
The choir still houses thirty-two of the forty-seven stalls from the 15th century. These stalls were intended for the chapter. They are decorated with images of saints, prophets and satirical scenes.
The Basilica of Saint Severinus has a number of well-maintained medieval statues. Among them, are the 13th-century Our Lady of Glad Tidings, the 14th-century alabaster Madonna of the Rose and one of Saint Martial.
Even though Roland's Oliphant (mentioned earlier) was still in the basilica as late as the 17th century, it disappeared before the Revolution.
Crypts.
Church crypt.
The original crypt was located in a 5th-century building. Its later use as a funerary basilica is attested to by the presence of sarcophagi which supposedly contained the remains of early bishops.
In 1635, the Carolingian apse in the basilica was removed to allow for the creation three recesses for the sarcophagi and the cenotaph of Saint Fort. At the time, this martyr was the object of a cult that lasted until recently. In fact, every May 16 mothers led their sons to the grave of Saint Fort to get "fortified".
Archaeological crypt.
The archaeological crypt is a vestige of early Christian cemetery and is one of the oldest in Bordeaux. It was situated between Place des Martyrs de la Resistance and Rue Judaïque. According to tradition, the necropolis at Saint Severinus was consecrated by Christ and seven bishops. The tradition also states that many of the rulers of Roncevaux are buried there. This would explain why this place was a magnet for pilgrims in the Middle Ages.
From 1909 to 1910 excavations were conducted south of the church by Paul Courteault. In part of the necropolis superimposed graves were discovered that dated from the 4th to 13th centuries. In the late 1950s and then from 1964 to 1969, Raymond Duru campaigned to get the crypt open to the public. Thanks to his efforts, it has been publicly accessible since the 1980s.
Today.
The basilica has benefited from restoration in recent decades. The roofs were redone, as were upper parts of the basilica. The chapels of Madonna of the Rose and Saint John as well as choir were restored.
In 2005, the Gothic entrance benefitted from a restoration funded by the city of Bordeaux and Historic Monuments. During this restoration, that traces of the original polychrome were discovered. This import discovery allows one to imagine the entrance in its original state.

K2-229b

K2-229b (previously designated EPIC 228801451.01) is an extremely hot, solid, iron-rich exoplanet in a close orbit around the active K-dwarf K2-229 in the constellation Virgo, 335 light years away from Earth.
Characteristics.
Mass, radius, and temperature.
K2-229b is a relatively Earth-sized planet, first identified using the transit method, where a planet passes in front of its host star and blocks a tiny fraction of its light. When the planet was first discovered, only its radius was known. It was determined to be 1.165 , or about 16.5% larger than Earth. A planet of this size is most likely rocky with a solid surface, like Earth itself. However, radial velocity measurements using the HARPS spectrograph revealed that K2-229b was far denser and more massive than initially expected. The planet has a mass of 2.59 and an extremely high density of about 8.9 g/cm3, giving it about 91% more surface gravity than Earth. The unusually high mass and density of K2-229b indicates a Mercury-like composition dominated by an iron core taking up about 70% of the planet's mass.
Due to its extremely tight orbit, K2-229b is one of the hottest planets yet found. It has an equilibrium temperature of , hot enough to melt iron. The day side has an even higher temperature in excess of .
Orbit and Rotation.
K2-229b has one of the shortest orbital periods known, with one full orbit taking just 0.584 days (14 hours) to complete. The planet orbits its host star at a distance of 0.012888 AU, nearly 100 times closer in than Earth. For comparison, our Solar System's innermost planet, Mercury, takes 88 days to orbit at 0.39 AU. K2-229b has an orbital eccentricity of 0 and is most likely tidally locked with its host star.
Host star.
K2-229b orbits the orange dwarf star K2-229, which is about 79% the radius and 84% the mass of the Sun, with a temperature of 5185 K and an age of about 5.4 billion years. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old. K2-229 has a visual magnitude of 10.985, too faint to be seen without a telescope. It is noted for being extremely active.
Formation, composition, and conditions.
The discovery of the high mass and density of K2-229b was unexpected. "When we saw this planet that was Earth-sized, we thought it would have an Earth-like composition. But it turns out it's more like Mercury", astrophysicist Jessie Christiansen, who was not part of the team which discovered K2-229b, told "Newsweek". The unusual Mercury-like composition of K2-229b is believed to offer insight into how it and other high-density, Mercury-like planets could have formed.
There are multiple hypotheses on how K2-229b became so dense, with one stating that much of the planet's atmosphere was eroded away by stellar radiation from its nearby, active star. Another hypothesis suggests that K2-229b was formed when two planets in the system collided, much like the theory on how the Moon was created from a collision between Earth and another planet. As of March 2018, all these theories are still in play, and there is not enough evidence to either prove or refute them.
Researchers also noted K2-229b's position in its planetary system. "Interestingly K2-229b is also the innermost planet in a system of at least 3 planets, though all three orbit much closer to their star than Mercury. More discoveries like this will help us shed light on the formation of these unusual planets, as well as Mercury itself", commented Dr. David Armstrong, one of the members of the team from the University of Warwick's Astronomy and Astrophysics Group which discovered the planet.
K2-229b is noted for being quite similar to Mercury, with about the same core-mass fraction of 68 %. However, the former is far closer to its host star and is more susceptible to mantle evaporation than the latter. With a day side temperature of over 2,330 K (assuming it is tidally locked with its host star), K2-229 is expected to have at least a thin atmosphere of silicate vapor created from the high temperatures on the star-facing side of the planet. Despite the high activity of K2-229, the planet is not expected to completely lose this atmosphere. If K2-229b has a magnetic field it can resist atmospheric erosion, meaning that mantle evaporation is extremely unlikely to have resulted in the planet's iron-rich composition. That, and K2-229b is estimated to only lose 1.3×10−5 per year, too little to remove any more than a few percent of its total mass over its lifetime.

The Pathseeker

The Pathseeker is a 1977 novella by the Hungarian writer Imre Kertész. Set in a series of unnamed postwar European locales, the story follows a government commissioner going on vacation to a resort town with his wife. The commissioner makes a detour from the planned route in order to investigate an old, unspecified injustice. He conducts an ominous investigation, visiting a local landmark and traveling to an isolated rural factory, eventually finding himself in an overgrown yet empty field.
Described as both puzzling and profound by critics, the novella has been noted for its bewildering lack of particulars about setting. Though the Holocaust is never mentioned by name, most reviews suggest the unspecified past injustice is tied to the genocide Kertész survived as a young man. The work has also been called a wry indictment of superficial tourism and its trivializing effect on history.
Three decades after its initial publication in Hungary, Melville House Publishing published an English translation by Tim Wilkinson.

Robert Alan Phenicie (born March 4, 1966) is an American football coach and former player. He is the current head coach at Idaho State University. He was named the head coach in March 2017. Phenicie's other coaching stops took him to the University of Memphis, UCLA, Los Angeles Valley College, Cal State Northridge, the University of Montana and UNLV.
Coaching career.
Following Phenicie's graduation from Memphis, he pursued his master's degree while serving as an offensive graduate assistant for the Memphis Tigers football team from 1989–1991.
He then went to UCLA, also as an offensive graduate assistant in 1991 and 1992.
He then coached the wide receivers and quarterbacks at Los Angeles Valley College through the 1996 season.
From there, Phenicie moved on to be the offensive coordinator at Cal State Northridge for two seasons (1997–1998). He also coached the quarterbacks and the wide receivers.
In 1999, Phenicie was an assistant at UNLV.
Phenicie then moved on to Wyoming, serving as the wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator from 2000–2002. He also added co-offensive coordinator duties for the 2002 season.
In 2003, Phenicie joined the Montana coaching staff as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He helped Head Coach Bobby Hauck lead the Grizzlies to three National Championship game appearances.
In 2010, he made his second stop at UNLV. This time, Phenicie stayed five years. He was the offensive coordinator in 2010 and 2011, coached the quarterbacks from 2010–2012, and coached the tight ends in 2013 and 2014.
Phenicie then joined the Idaho State coaching staff as the assistant head coach for offense and wide receivers coach in 2015. Following the 2016 season, Phenicie was promoted to offensive coordinator, but soon after left to take a position on the Northern Iowa coaching staff. A week later, Idaho State head coach, Mike Kramer, retired. The next day, a week before spring practices were set to begin, Phenicie was named the head coach at Idaho State.
Phenicie's original contract was a two-year deal, and made him the head coach for the 2017 season, and guaranteed that he would remain on staff as at least the offensive coordinator in the second year. In December 2017, Phenicie was rewarded with a new contract, nearly doubling his salary, and making him the permanent head coach.
Playing career.
Phenicie began his college playing career as a tight end at Nebraska in 1984. He then transferred to Orange Coast College for a year, and then moved on to Memphis. He played in 11 games and caught four passes for 50 yards in 1987 for the Tigers.

Lali en Vivo

Lali en Vivo was a headlining concert tour by Argentine singer Lali Espósito. It was Espósito's third headlining tour, and the second one in support of her second studio album, "Soy" (2016). The tour began on November 3, 2017, in Buenos Aires, and concluded on July 28, 2018, in Barcelona.
Background.
On July 24, 2017, Espósito first announced that she was going on tour later that year with a brand new show. The show was supposed to be the continuation of her Soy Tour, but the singer told "Billboard" that, because of all the changes she had made, she had to rename it to "Lali en Vivo". In an interview with "Infobae", Espósito said "Lali en Vivo will be the biggest thing (at the technical level) that I have ever done so far. It will have an impressive staging (lights, screens, stage), a lot of dancers and special guests." Tickets for the show of November 3, 2017 at the Luna Park Arena sold out in less than four days, resulting in a second date on November 10 at the same place.
Concert synopsis.
The show begins with a video of Lali getting ready for the show. Espósito appears from behind a screen that splits in two, performing "Mi Religión" in a black bodysuit and thigh-high pointed boots, followed by "Te Siento" and "Unico". Before performing "Boomerang", an interlude that features images from its music video is played. Wearing a golden crop top and an oversized jean jacket with golden chains, the singer then performs "Tu Revolución". After making everyone dance, the lights go down and Lali appears wearing embroidered-golden Palazzo trousers, and a crop top and a coat of the same color to perform an intimate medley of ballads, including "Del Otro Lado", "Cielo Salvador", "Desamor" and "Cree en Mí". 
For the next segment of the show, the heat returns while Lali performs "Soy" in a colorful-metallic bodysuit. Accompanied by all-female dancers dressed the same way, the singer sings "Una Na" and "Bomba". Then, she appears in a short red dress and performs "Lejos de Mí", "Ego", "Reina" and "Amor es Presente". Towards the end of the show, Lali returns to the stage in a white one-pice suit with chains to perform some of her danceable hits like "Mil Años Luz", Irresistible and "A Bailar". 
The singer begins the last segment of the show singing two songs from her upcoming studio album. For "Tu Novia", she is accompanied by her dancers to perform a hot choreography, while for "Tu Sonrisa", she plays the harmonica and is accompanied by her band. Espósito closes off the show performing "No Estoy Sola" while confetti rains down and she disappears from the stage.
Setlist.
This set list is representative of the show on November 3, 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is not representative of all concerts for the duration of the tour.

Nova Scotia in the American Revolution

The Province of Nova Scotia was heavily involved in the American Revolutionary War (1776–1783). At that time, Nova Scotia also included present-day New Brunswick until that colony was created in 1784. The Revolution had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia, "almost the 14th American Colony". At the beginning, there was ambivalence in Nova Scotia over whether the colony should join the Americans in the war against Britain. Largely as a result of American privateer raids on Nova Scotia villages, as the war continued, the population of Nova Scotia solidified their support for the British. Nova Scotians were also influenced to remain loyal to Britain by the presence of British military units, judicial prosecution by the Nova Scotia Governors and the efforts of Reverend Henry Alline.
Context.
In Nova Scotia a number of former New England residents objected to the Stamp Act 1765, but recent British immigrants and London-oriented business interests based in Halifax, the provincial capital were more influential in keeping the colony loyal to the crown. The only major public protest was the hanging in effigy of the stamp distributor and Lord Bute. The act was implemented in both provinces, but Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766, beset by ungrounded fears for his safety. Authorities there were ordered to allow ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps.
1775–1778.
At the outbreak of the American Revolution, many Nova Scotians were New England-born and were sympathetic to the American Patriots. This support slowly eroded over the first two years of the war as American privateers attacked Nova Scotian villages and shipping to try to interrupt Nova Scotian trade with the American Loyalists still in New England. During the war, American privateers captured 225 vessels either leaving or arriving at Nova Scotia ports. In June 1775, the Americans had their first naval victory over the British in the Battle of Machias. In response to this defeat, in July 1775, the British sent from Halifax two armed sloops to Machias, Province of Massachusetts Bay to capture the rebels. American privateer Joseph O'Brien captured these two British vessels on 12 July 1775 in the Bay of Fundy. The following month American privateers from Machias executed their third consecutive victory in the region by raiding St John.
In retaliation for the American victories at Machias and St. John, the British executed the Burning of Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine) in October 1775. The following month, in November 1775, the American Patriots retaliated by ships "Hancock" and from Marblehead conducting the Raid on Charlottetown (1775) and Canso, Nova Scotia where they took five prizes. (In the raid on Charlottetown, the privateers also sought revenge against Nathaniel Coffin, the Loyalist who cut down the Liberty Tree in Boston.) The first year of the war ended with the American privateer Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.
In 1775, rebellion began to ferment within Nova Scotia. Governor Legge began to target prominent Protestant dissenters of the St. Matthew's Church: John Fillis and judge William Smith and John Frost (minister). The Governor also targeted judge Seth Harding (judge) from the Liverpool Township and he left on October 1775 and did not return. According to Cahill, as a result of "instances of non-legal repression and petty tyranny, such as the summary dismissals of Judge Smith and Justice Frost, had ended with the recall of Governor Legge [to London] in January 1776."
A small number of Nova Scotians went south to serve with the Continental Army against the British; upon the completion of the war these rebels were granted land in the Refugee Tract in Ohio.
In 1776, there was also armed rebellion such as the Maugerville Rebellion (1776). The other attack was by land and led by Jonathan Eddy who led the Battle of Fort Cumberland. According to historian Barry Cahill, this rebellion led the Nova Scotia government to "use the formal law in sedition trials for an essential aspect of the official response to the American Revolution." The government arraigned dissenters John Seccombe and jailed Timothy Houghton for sedition (incitement to rebellion). Malachy Salter was convicted of sedition in 1777.
At the end of 1776, there were two significant American attacks on Nova Scotia. One of these assaults was by sea and led by John Paul Jones in the Raid on Canso (1776). In 1776, John Allan led the Maliseet to challenge the loyalists on Indian Island, New Brunswick to join the rebel cause. In 1776, two American privateers took four vessels at Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia and took the people of the hamlet prisoners.
In March 1777, in the first American Navy encounter with the British, the British ran the American vessel aground in the Battle off Yarmouth (1777) and the privateers escaped to find protection among the local village. The crew found support and the inhabitants of Yarmouth sheltered the American privateers from the British navy until they made their escape back to New England. The engagement between the American privateers and local militia was one of several in the region. On 2 May 1777, in the Minas Basin Captain Collet ordered the capture the American privateer schooner "Sea Duck", under the command of John Bohannan. He had the vessel taken to Windsor. In June, the American Patriots launched the St. John River expedition. In July 1777, HMS "Amazon" captured the privateer Active off of Cape Sable Island. In August 1777, the British raided Machias.
The following year, in April 1778 the American privateers again attacked Liverpool. On 9 August, Privateers attacked Cornwallis at present-day Kentville, which resulted in the British building Fort Hughes in the area. The fort could hold 56 soldiers. In 1778, the British schooner Hope also destroyed a privateer ship at Canso. Seven Patriots escaped but were later captured near Halifax. Prisoners were returned from Halifax to Boston on the Swift in September 1778. The Cartel Silver Eel took prisoners to Boston in October 1778. In 1779 Maugerville was raided again by Maliseets working with John Allan in Machias, Maine. A vessel was captured and two or three residents' homes were plundered. In response, a blockhouse was built at the mouth of Oromocto River also named Fort Hughes (New Brunswick) (named after the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir Richard Hughes). In June 1779, the British troops at Windsor captured 12 American privateers in the Bay of Fundy, where they cruised in a large boat, armed, plundering the vessels and the inhabitants. In 1779, American privateers returned to Canso and destroyed the fisheries, which were worth £50,000 a year to Britain.
1779–1782.
In 1779 the British from Halifax adopted a strategy to seize parts of Maine, especially around Penobscot Bay, and make it a new colony to be called New Ireland. It was intended to be a permanent colony for Loyalists and a base for military action during the war.
In early July 1779, Francis McLean left Halifax and led a British naval and military force into Castine's commodious harbor, landed troops, and took control of the village. He began erecting Fort George on one of the highest points of the peninsula. Alarmed by this incursion, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sent the Penobscot Expedition to lay side to the fort and reclaim the territory. The siege started on July 25 and lasted three weeks until the arrival of British commander George Collier who crushed the American expedition. (The British held New Ireland, the planned loyalist homeland, until the end of the war. Instead, the British divided Nova Scotia and named the new Loyalist homeland New Brunswick.)
At the end of 1779, the British at Halifax experienced some significant losses. In December 1779 the schooner Hope wrecked near the Sambro Island Light on the Three Sisters Rocks. Captain Henry Baldwin and six other crew were killed. Weeks later, 170 British sailors were lost when two vessels – "North" and "St Helena" – were wrecked in a storm when entering Halifax harbour.
On 10 July 1780, in the Battle off Halifax, the British privateer brig "Resolution" (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the American privateer "Viper" (22 guns and 130 men) off Halifax at Sambro Light. In what one observer described as "one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering", the two privateers began a "severe engagement" during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes. The engagement resulted in the surrender of the British ship and the death of up to 18 British and 33 American sailors.
In May 1781, the local Nova Scotia militia defeated American privateers in the Battle off Cape Split. The British and French also clashed in the Naval battle off Cape Breton. Finally, the privateers returned in the Raid on Annapolis Royal (1781). In the final year of attacks on Nova Scotia, the American privateers fought in the Naval battle off Halifax and the Raid on Lunenburg (1782).
Defence regiments.
To guard against American privateer attacks, the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) (2nd battalion) was garrisoned at forts around Atlantic Canada. Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) in Windsor, Nova Scotia was the Regiment's headquarters to prevent a possible American land assault on Halifax from the Bay of Fundy. Also raised in Nova Scotia were the Royal Fencible American Regiment and the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment. The King's Orange Rangers defended Liverpool, the second largest settlement in the colony. The Hessians also served in Nova Scotia for five years (1778–1783). They protected the colony from American privateers, such as when they responded to the Raid on Lunenburg (1782). They were led by Baron Oberst Franz Carl Erdmann von Seitz. There were 5000 British troops in Nova Scotia by 1778.
Naval defence.
In terms of naval force, along with issuing letters of marque for different privateering vessels, in 1776 the Government also retained the armed schooner Loyal Nova Scotian (8 guns, 28 men). On Nov. 26, 1776, under the command of John Alexander, the Loyal Nova Scotian re-captured the privateer Friendship. In 1778, the vessel was ordered to Lunenburg and then retired. By 1779, Nova Scotia's naval defence had four vessels: a frigate (32 guns), sloop of war (18 guns), armed schooner (14 guns) and another armed schooner (10 guns). These ships were named Revenge (18 guns, 50 men, Captain Jones Fawson; Captain James Gandy), Buckram (8 guns, 20 men, Captain Archibald Allardice) and the armed schooner Insulter (Captain John Sheppard), all acting under government orders. There were numerous other privateers supported by local villages: Enterprise (Liverpool), Hero (100 men, 16 guns, Captain Bailey, Chester), Arbuthnot, The David, Mowatt, Lady Hammond, The Fly, Sir George Hammond, Lancaster, Dreadnought (Captain Dean of Liverpool), The Success, The Lively, the sloop Howe, and the ship Jack.
In 1778, Nova Scotians ships had taken at least 48 prizes and four recaptures. Between 1779 and 1781, they captured 42.
Treaty of Watertown.
In 1776, the Mi'kmaq signed the Treaty of Watertown, agreeing to support the American Patriots against the American Loyalists. Three years later, on 7 June 1779, the Mi'kmaq "delivered up" the Watertown treaty to Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin and re-established Mi'kmaw loyalty to the British. After the British resounding victory over the American Penobscot Expedition, according to Mi'kmaw historian Daniel Paul, Mi'kmaq in present-day New Brunswick renounced the Watertown treated and signed a treaty of alliance with the British on 24 September 1779.
St. John's Island and Newfoundland.
The population of St. John's Island (present-day Prince Edward Island), small compared to Nova Scotia, was only about 1215 in 1774. Nova Scotia has been described as a 'shield' to the other two colonies, stopping much unrest from the American colonies from reaching them. St. John's Island during the time has been described as "a model colony".
At the outbreak of the American Revolution, Phillips Callback was in charge of St. Johns Island. Thomas Gage began recruiting men to help defend Quebec against American attack; however, his efforts were hindered by a group of American revolutionaries living in Pictou, Nova Scotia. A group of about 150 American soldiers set out to attack ships bringing arms to the British. Though they failed in their attempt, they arrived in Pictou, and from the Americans living there learned about recruiting efforts, and attacked Charlottetown. They threatened to set fire to the town but Callback convinced them to spare the town. Callback and Thomas Wright (the surveyor of the island) were taken prisoner. The two hostages were eventually released, and made it back to the island on May 1, 1776.
After the attack, an armed brig was sent to guard St. John's Island, and a militia was raised. The brig left when arrived in September 1776. A fort was planned to better defend the town then Fort Amherst could. After Eddy's raid, the militia (which had only existed as 20 men previously) was raised to 80, and named The Loyal Island of St. John Volunteers. In 1778, five companies under Timothy Hierlihy were sent to better garrison the island. At the troops arrival, Callback was ordered to disband the "superfluous and expensive" militia. He ignored the orders. The feasibility of attacking St. John's was considered by the French navy.
The Island, despite perceived danger, served mainly as a stopping point for British troops on their way out from Quebec, and British troops bringing captured privateers back. A group of 200 Hessians en route to Quebec spent a year on the Island. Work on the fort continued until Patterson (the governor) arrived in 1780. He saw the five companies and 8,000 pounds which had been spent on fortifications as a colossal waste of money. Work was halted and the companies returned. Throughout the war, the Island was highly loyal, and endured few attacks.
In 1765, Newfoundlands population was around 15,000, consisting largely of Irish immigrants. As it was not technically a colony, Newfoundland did not pay the Stamp Act 1765 or Townshend Acts taxes. Despite having minor problems with the British government, the island "preserved a tone of exemplary loyalty." The island maintained nearly no defenses, and as such, Esek Hopkins was sent to attack Newfoundland. In September 1776, a group of several privateers took three or four ships, and plundered about ten others. In 1777, was captured, and several months later retaken. The following year, many other ships were attacked, particularly by .
Upon the arrival of Richard Edwards, many privateers were defeated, and by 1779, very few were left. Edwards ordered cannon distributed to allow towns to defend themselves against attack. In early 1780, at Mortier, a privateer was repulsed by the town. That same year, a fleet, led by Edwards, of nine ships, captured six privateers. Fourteen were captured the next year. Several companies were raised, and several hundred soldiers left to fight with British troops.
Both islands had minor food shortages, particularly after a fire on St. Johns burnt 35 houses, and many stores of food. The fishing industries in both were reduced to "low and miserable state[s]," and the general population of both decreased as well. An outbreak of robberies occurred as people needed various resources. A riot occurred in 1779 on St. John's, in which one person was killed.
Loyalist settlements.
About 20,000 Loyalists fled to Nova Scotia during and after the American Revolution. Most came from the state of New York. The three largest settlements being Saint John River Valley, Digby, Nova Scotia and Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Cape Breton was a separate colony as received 3150 Loyalists. Ile St. Jean received 300 Loyalist refugees. The British returned New Ireland to the Americans and the territory in Maine entered the control of the newly independent American state of Massachusetts. Those from New Ireland settled St. Andrews, New Brunswick. With the Loyalist homeland gone, Nova Scotia was divided to accommodate the Loyalists: both New Brunswick and Cape Breton were created as separate colonies for the Loyalists (Cape Breton returned to Nova Scotia in 1820).
There are many Loyalists who settled in Halifax and were buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia), including a number of Black Loyalists who have unmarked graves.
Numerous British soldiers became Loyalists and their regiments settled in various communities across Nova Scotia. The Royal Fencible American Regiment settled in Wallace, Nova Scotia. The Second Battalion of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) settled in Municipality of East Hants, particularly at Kennetcook, Nova Scotia.
There were three Regiments that settled Digby, Nova Scotia: New Jersey Volunteers, the Royal Garrison Battalion and the Loyal American Regiment. Black Pioneers settled in Brindley Town, (now Acaciaville, Nova Scotia).
The Black Pioneers settled at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. The Hessians also settled Annapolis Royal and other places in Nova Scotia.
At Guysborough, Nova Scotia there were six regiments that settled: Jamaica Rangers, Jamaica Volunteers, Negro Horse, Royal North Carolina Regiment, Duke of Cumberland's Regiment and the North Carolina Highlanders. East Country Harbour, Nova Scotia was settled by three regiments: the Royal North Carolina Regiment, the King's Carolina Rangers (see Joseph Marshall) and the South Carolina Royalists.
The Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment settled Ship Harbour, Nova Scotia and Antigonish, Nova Scotia.
The King's Orange Rangers settled in Middleton, Nova Scotia.

Boss Level

 
Boss Level is a 2021 American science fiction action film directed by Joe Carnahan and written by Carnahan and Chris and Eddie Borey, from a story by the Boreys. It stars Frank Grillo as a retired special forces soldier who tries to escape a never-ending time loop that results in his death. Mel Gibson, Naomi Watts and Michelle Yeoh co-star.
The film was originally announced in 2012 as "Continue", and was developed by Carnahan at 20th Century Fox, but it did not move forward. "Boss Level" was formally announced in November 2017, and was produced by Carnahan, Grillo, Randall Emmett and George Furla. Filming took place in Georgia from March to May 2018. The film was originally scheduled to be released by Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures on August 16, 2019, but was delayed. It was released in the United States on March 5, 2021, by Hulu.
Plot.
Roy Pulver, a retired Delta Force soldier in Atlanta, has been stuck in a time loop, and has learned the day's patterns through many previous loops. He wakes at 07:00 AM each day, avoids an assassin in his apartment and an attack by a gunman in a helicopter outside his window, then escapes his apartment before it explodes. He has been able to elude more assassins throughout the morning, but finds himself unable to figure out how to survive a final attack at 12:47 PM, waking up back in his apartment on the next loop.
On the day before Roy entered the loop, his estranged wife Jemma had asked Roy to visit her at defense contractor Dynow Labs under the pretense of a job interview. The two argue over Joe, their son, who Jemma has led to believe that Roy is just a family friend. When Colonel Clive Ventor, head of Dynow, discovers Roy near Jemma's highly classified project, he has him escorted out, but not before Jemma obtains a sample of Roy's hair.
In one loop, Roy tries to call Jemma but instead reaches Ventor, who tells him that Jemma died from a lab accident the day before. Roy becomes suspicious. On a later loop, he finds Joe at Underground Atlanta, skipping school for a video game tournament. Roy spends the day with Joe but does not mention Jemma's death. The assassins arrive to kill Roy, and Roy uses his body to protect Joe, telling him as he dies that he is his father.
When Roy next wakes, he realizes that the assassins had followed him using a dental tracking device implanted by Alice, his date from the night before (a dental hygienist). Through more trial-and-error loops, Roy finds a way to remove the tracker and sneak into Dynow, killing several guards and assassins, but is always stopped by Ventor. Ventor reveals to Roy that Jemma's project is the Osiris Spindle, a quantum device capable of rewriting history, which Ventor plans to use to set himself up as the world's dictator. Ventor admits he was responsible for Jemma's death after an argument the night before. As she had started the Spindle and no one else knows how to operate it, Ventor warns Roy the Spindle will destroy the world if it runs too long.
On further loops, Roy makes the connection to the Egyptian god of the afterlife, Osiris, and realizes Jemma must have placed him in the Spindle to stop Ventor. While he is able to further infiltrate Dynow and kill Ventor, Roy learns the assassins were sent to kill Joe, and arrives too late. As he mourns over Joe, the Osiris Spindle explodes and destroys the world.
Roy spends several loops in a despondent state, then decides to spend several more loops with Joe, staying with him until the Spindle's explosion. In one loop, he learns that Jemma had called Joe that morning, later than he previously thought she was still alive, and realizes he can save her. After determining the exact time and place she died at Ventor's hands in Dynow, fourteen minutes after he wakes up, Roy uses the next loop to hijack the helicopter, get to Dynow, kill the waiting assassins, and stop Ventor before he kills Jemma.
Roy tells Jemma he has been spending his loops with Joe, and that he has seen the end of the world. Jemma explains that they may be able to stop the chain reaction if Roy enters the Osiris Spindle which will reset the day one final time for Roy. This time, if something happens to him he will die for real. With the knowledge of how to defeat Ventor and save both Jemma and Joe, Roy enters the Spindle.
Cast.

Production.
In January 2012, Joe Carnahan announced that he was working on the film, originally titled "Continue", for 20th Century Fox, and described it as ""Groundhog Day" as an action movie", inspired by video game rules. In May 2012, it was reported that Fox was moving forward with the project. In September 2012, Carnahan posted screen tests that he had filmed with actor Frank Grillo on Twitter, saying he was sharing them "to show you how cool this movie could have been..."
In November 2017, it was reported that Grillo and Mel Gibson were negotiating to star in the film, now titled "Boss Level", with Carnahan writing and directing. Further casting continued in March 2018 with the additions of Will Sasso, Naomi Watts, Annabelle Wallis and Rob Gronkowski. Filming began that month in Savannah, Georgia. Ken Jeong, Mathilde Ollivier, Selina Lo and Michelle Yeoh joined the cast the following month.
In April 2018, filming took place in Atlanta, including in Pullman Yard, the Oakland City MARTA station, and near the Georgia Aquarium. Filming also took place in Decatur. A restaurant scene was filmed in Atlanta on May 12 and 13, 2018. On May 13, "Screen Daily" reported that filming had wrapped. The film's budget was $45 million.
Release.
In April 2018, Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It was scheduled to be released on August 16, 2019, but missed its release date.&lt;ref name="/Film"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A special free advance screening of the film, sponsored by entertainment website Collider, was held at the ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood on February 11, 2020, followed by a session with Grillo and Carnahan.
In June 2020, Entertainment Studios dropped the film. In November 2020, the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in an eight-figure deal by Hulu, which was later revealed to be worth $11,750,000. The film was released on March 5, 2021.
In July 2021 Blumhouse Productions sued the producers of the film for breach of contract. Blumhouse asserts that they were brought in to recut the film after the original version failed to secure distribution, but have not been compensated for their work, which was to be 5% of the acquisition fee paid by Hulu. Blumhouse also sued Hulu for continuing to stream their cut of the film after being sent multiple cease and desist notices.
It was released in the United Kingdom on Amazon Prime Video.
Reception.
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74%, based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The site's critics consensus reads: ""Boss Level" powers up the increasingly crowded time-loop genre with a gleefully over-the-top sci-fi action thriller that revels in its own excess." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Writing for IndieWire, Christian Blauvelt gave the film a grade of B and said, "It's a star part, and Grillo commands it. Most importantly, he gets you to invest in Roy enough that, even without a controller in your hands, you never feel like you're simply watching someone else play a videogame. With no pixels in sight, Grillo gives "Boss Level" the thing most videogame movie riffs lack: a pulse."

Lethal White

Lethal White is the fourth novel in the "Cormoran Strike" series, written by J. K. Rowling and published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The novel was released on 18 September 2018.
Background.
"Lethal White" is preceded by "The Cuckoo's Calling", "The Silkworm", and "Career of Evil"; there are tentative plans to follow it with at least five more stories. Rowling announced the completion of the manuscript on 23 March 2018, after approximately two years of writing, and the book was released on 18 September 2018. "Lethal White" follows the private detective Cormoran Strike and his partner Robin Ellacott. The story begins with a prologue following immediately after the conclusion of "Career of Evil" detailing events taking place at Robin's wedding reception.
Plot.
At Robin Ellacott's marriage to Matthew Cunliffe, Cormoran Strike's capture of the Shacklewell Ripper the night before is already widely known, except by Robin. When Strike tells her that he had been trying to contact her during the week, she realizes that Matthew had deleted Strike's messages, which results in a serious row between the new spouses. Before Strike leaves, Robin accepts his offer of working as a salaried partner in the detective agency.
One year later, Strike has grown his detective agency to the point where he needs to hire more investigators. He receives an unsolicited visit from Billy Knight, a young man with a history of mental illness who claims to have witnessed a child's murder and the burial of the body in woodland some years before, but is unable to provide any details before he runs out of Strike's office. While trying to establish Billy's identity, Strike meets Billy's older brother Jimmy and Jimmy's girlfriend Flick, radical left-wing activists who claim that Billy is unstable and unreliable.
Strike's meeting with Jimmy draws the attention of Jasper Chiswell, the Minister for Culture, whom Strike knew from investigating the combat death of his son Freddie. Chiswell has been blackmailed by Jimmy and hires Strike to investigate; he identifies Geraint Winn, the husband of a political enemy, as Jimmy's likely partner. Chiswell does not reveal what he is accused of, but claims that what he did was legal "at the time". Robin Ellacott then goes undercover in Chiswell's office to carry out surveillance on Winn, whose wife Della Winn has a neighboring office, although the undercover assignment places more strain on her marriage. She meets Chiswell's family who works for him: daughter Izzy, illegitimate son Raphael, and second wife Kinvara. By bugging Winn's office, Robin discovers that Winn has been embezzling money from his wife's charities, and Chiswell uses this knowledge to stop Winn's blackmail.
Chiswell summons Strike and Robin to a house that he keeps in the city for business, perhaps intending to fire them, but on arrival, they find Chiswell's body, apparently dead from suffocation and an overdose of anti-depressants. The Metropolitan Police rule his death a suicide, but Izzy is convinced that Kinvara is responsible, again hiring Strike to investigate. Strike believes that the mysterious blackmail is connected to Chiswell's death and eventually learns that Chiswell and Jack Knight, Jimmy and Billy's late father, built gallows for export before the European Union banned the export of torture and execution equipment from member states. Two sets of these gallows were sold to Zimbabwe, where one set was stolen by rebels and used in the murder of a British student. The gallows could be traced to Chiswell because Billy had carved the nearby White Horse of Uffington into it.
Meanwhile, Robin continues to struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder a year after her encounter with the Shacklewell Ripper, while Matthew continues to interfere with her work. But Robin separates from Matthew and moves out when she finds proof that he has been having a long-term affair throughout most of their relationship. She intends to seek a divorce when she can afford it and moves in first with her friend Vanessa Ekwensi, then with Strike's friends Nick and Ilsa Herbert. Strike counsels her, drawing on his own experience of losing a leg. Strike's ex-girlfriend Charlotte Ross, now married and pregnant, reappears and unsuccessfully pursues Strike.
Strike learns that Chiswell wrote Kinvara out of his will and bequeathed everything to his 10-year-old grandson, while allowing Kinvara only to live on the family estate for the rest of her life. However, Chiswell carelessly omitted certain items from the will, including a diamond necklace that is the family's last item of real value, meaning that legally such items may be Kinvara's. Strike suspects there are other items of value Chiswell overlooked. He is drawn to a supposedly-worthless painting titled "Mare Mourning" and discovers that it may be a lost George Stubbs artwork depicting a mare mourning a foal that died of lethal white syndrome. If its provenance were to be established, it would probably be worth over £20 million. Strike can then identify Chiswell's killer: Raphael, who had never been accepted by the family but had worked for an art dealer. Raphael had tipped off Flick about a cleaning job at Chiswell's, expecting that she would find out about the gallows sales and tell Jimmy, who then demanded 50% of the profits. Raphael also seduced and conspired with Kinvara to kill Chiswell; when Flick learned that Chiswell had inadvertently found out about the affair and also had begun to investigate "Mare Mourning", Raphael killed Chiswell at once with Kinvara's help. 
Kinvara confesses on being interrogated by police, but Raphael sends Robin texts purporting to be from Matthew, luring her into a trap. He keeps her alive to interrogate her about the investigation; Robin stalls for time by outlining everything in detail, even describing his un-executed plan to kill Kinvara. Strike realizes Raphael's duplicity when he notices that the text messages to Robin came from a disposable mobile phone used in the blackmail case. The police trace the phone and raid the houseboat on which Raphael has Robin, arresting him just as he has decided to kill her and flee or kill himself. In the aftermath, Strike, Robin and Izzy meet Billy to discuss the "murder" he witnessed. Izzy and Strike reveal that Billy had been drugged by Freddie and Jimmy. Billy then saw Freddie choke a young Raphael until he passed out, followed by the burial of a small horse that Freddie had killed in a separate act of cruelty, which Strike's crew has dug up. Strike and Robin then leave together.
In other media.
"Lethal White" was adapted as part of the television series starring Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike and Holliday Grainger as Robin Ellacott. Filming began in September 2019. The first episode was broadcast on 30th August 2020.

Surviv.io

Surviv.io is a browser based multiplayer online 2D battle royale game created by Justin Kim and Nick Clark. It was released in October 2017 for browser, and in October and November 2018 respectively for iOS and Android devices. Similar to other titles in the battle royale genre, players battle against other players on a large map from a top-down perspective, scavenging for supplies and weapons. The game also supports two or four player team modes, and can be played on mobile browsers as well.
In December 2019, Surviv.io was acquired by online gaming website Kongregate. In September 2020, Surviv.io was released on Steam.
Gameplay.
Players, also called "Survivrs", are represented by circular figures on a 2D grid-like playing field, surrounded by a circular "red zone" that shrinks as the game progresses. Players in the “red zone” lose health every second, and the amount of health lost per second increases as the game progresses. Players start with only their fists, while extra gear can be found in breakable crates and objects located across the map, and in houses and other buildings. Each game features a randomly generated map, with the locations of buildings and loot being randomized each time.
Upon death, players drop all their items. The last player alive wins. 
The game has a rotation of limited time modes with special gameplay modes that offer exclusive weapons and items. 
Equipment.
Weapons in Surviv.io range from close-quarter shotguns and SMGs to long range sniper and assault rifles. Melee weapons such as katanas and throwable grenades can also be found. Most weapons require ammunition, which is found separately. Scopes give players a wider view of their surroundings, which vary from 1x (the smallest field of vision) 2x, 4x, 8x and 15x (the largest field of vision). Vests and helmets protect the player, and can be found in four levels, with level 1 providing the least protection and level 3 being the strongest that can be obtained in the normal mode; level 4 vests and helmets only exist in limited time modes. Players heal using consumable healing items.
Development.
Surviv.io is developed by Justin Kim and Nick Clark. Kim stated that their design philosophy while developing the game was to allow the player to enter a game as fast as possible by minimizing the time in between matches.
In December 2019, Surviv.io was acquired by online gaming website Kongregate, with the company taking over development of the game. In a press release, the company stated they hoped to "invest in the game’s features, especially on mobile." Co-creator Justin Kim expressed that the team was "excited to have Kongregate's team create new features and expand the player experience over the years to come."
In 2020, Nick and Justin announced they would be taking a break and the development would be fully passed on to Kongregate.
Reception.
PC Gamer praised the game's fast paced gameplay and short matchmaking times, calling it "one of the most enjoyable BR games out there."
VG247 named the game the "most popular battle royale title after Fortnite and PUBG".

Adela of Louvain (died 1083)

Adela of Louvain (d.1083) was margravine of Meissen and later, margravine of the Saxon Ostmark.
Life.
Adela was the daughter of Lambert II of Louvain and Uda of Lorraine (also called Oda of Verdun), daughter of Gothelo I of Lorraine.
Before 1060, Adela of Louvain, married Otto I, Margrave of Meissen, Count of Weimar. After Otto’s death in 1067 Eckbert I, Margrave of Meissen attempted to repudiate his own wife, Immilla of Turin in order to marry Adela and secure his hold on the mark of Meissen. Eckbert died in 1068, and the following year, Adela married Dedi I of Lusatia. Dedi also tried to claim the mark of Meissen through marriage to Adela, and rebelled against Henry IV of Germany when Henry refused to invest Dedi with this property. Lampert of Hersfeld depicted Adela as the driving force behind Dedi’s rebellion, calling her a “most ferocious wife” ("saevissima uxor").
According to Lampert, Adela goaded Dedi into action by telling him: “if he were a man, he would not receive this injustice un-avenged, nor would he conduct himself with less courage than her first husband [Otto]”. Lambert adds that it was rumoured that Adela was behind the assassination of Dedi II (Dedi I’s son by his first wife, Oda) in 1069.

Store Kongensgade Faience Manufactury

 
Store Kongensgade Faience Manufactury, active from 1722 to the late 1770s, was a faience ceramics manufacturer located on Store Kongensgade in Copenhagen. It was the first manufacturer of faience in the Nordic countries. It is especially remembered for its bishop-bowls and tray tables but has also produced decorative tiles for several historic buildings. 
History.
On 27 November 1722, Frederick IV granted a consortium a royal license to establish a faience manufactury in Copenhagen with a monopoly on the production of faience with blue decorations. The factory was located at the corner of Store Kongensgade and present-day Fredericiagade and variously referred to as Delf's Porcelins Fabrique or Hollandsch Steentøjs Fabrique. One of the founders was Rasmus Æreboe.
The first director of the factory was Johan Wolff. He was succeeded by Johan Ernst Pfau (c. 1685-1752) in 1728.
Christian Gierløf (1706-86), a brewer, took over the factory in 1749. He was soon faced with new competition, both from Jacob Fortling's Kastrup Værk on Amager, an enterprise in Schlesvig and especially a faience manufactury established by Peter Hofnagel in Østerbro. Hofnagel had previously owned Herrebö Faience Manufactury in Norway. The factory in Store Kongensgade struggled up through the 1760sm culminating with the termination of its monopoly on faience with blue decorations in 1769. It closed before 1779.
Products.
A characteristic product from the faience factory in Store Kongensgade was so-called bishop-bowl, a type of punch bowl designed in the shape of a mitre (bishop's hat) and used for serving an alcoholic drink known as "bishop". The factory is also known for its tray tables. The porcelain has usually blue but manganese violet decorations are occasionally seen. More everyday items and tiles were also produced at the factory.
Legacy.
The tiles in the Queen's Pancake Kitchen at Frederiksberg Palace (1735) and on the staircase in the Hermitage in Jægersborg Dyrehave north of Copenahgen (1737) came from the factory in Store Kongensgade. 
A tray table (1749-1771), a punch bowl (1740) and a Plateau (1726) from the factory are on display in The David Collection in Copenhagen.

Diuris oporina

Diuris oporina, commonly called the autumn donkey orchid or northern white donkeys tails is a species of orchid that is endemic to Queensland. It has a single tapering, linear leaf at its base and up to ten white flowers with mauve to purple markings. It grows in the drier parts of the tablelands in Far North Queensland.
Description.
"Diuris oporina" is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single tapering, linear leaf long, wide with a purplish red base. Up to ten white flowers with mauve, lilac or purplish markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is oblong to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear, green, long and about wide. The petals are more or less erect, egg-shaped, long and wide on a purplish brown stalk long. The labellum is long, projects forwards below horizontal and has three lobes.

Parish of Essie

The Parish of Essie, New South Wales is a remote civil parish of Evelyn County, New South Wales in far northwest New South Wales, located at , on the border with South Australia.
Geography.
The geography of the Parish is mostly the flat, arid landscape of the Channel Country. The parish has a Köppen climate classification of BWh (Hot desert). The nearest town is Tibooburra to the north, which is on the Silver City Highway and lies south of the Sturt National Park.
History.
The Parish is on the traditional lands of the Wadigali and to a lesser extent Karenggapa, Aboriginal peoples.
When James Cook claimed New South Wales for Great Britain from Possession Island. He claimed the territory up to the 141st meridian east making the Parish of Essie on the border of that claim.
Charles Sturt passed to the west of the parish and camped for six months at nearby Preservation Creek, during 1845.
In 1861 the Burke and Wills expedition passed to the east.
Gold was discovered nearby in the 1870s.

HMS Pocahontas (1780)

HMS "Pochahontas was the Virginia letter of marque "Pocahontas", launched in 1777. The British Royal Navy captured her in 1780. She participated in the battle of Fort Royal, Martinique, in April 1781. In May she was renamed Pachahunta" (or "Packahunter"). The Navy sold her at Jamaica in 1782.
Capture.
"Pocahontas" was built on the Rappahanock in 1777 and fitted out at Fredericksburg.
Captain Eleazer Callender of the Virginia Navy ship "Dragon" resigned his commission on 20 July 1779 to take command of "Pocahontas". He brought with him John Hamilton, his First lieutenant on "Dragon". At the time, "Virginia's naval vessels were poorly armed, incompetently manned and ill-fitted for service."
The 74-gun ship captured "Pocahontas" on 12 September 1780.
Royal Navy service.
The Royal Navy purchased "Pocahontas" on 2 October 1780. On 29–30 April 1781 "Pochahontas", Commander Edward Tyrell Smith, was at the inconclusive battle of Fort Royal. On 1 May, as Rear Admiral Samuel Hood and his squadron sailed from Martinique, the French followed. HMS "Torbay" and "Pocahontas" were lagging and within range of the enemy guns. The French directed their fire at "Torbay" which sustained damage to her masts and rigging. Hood sent to tow "Pocahontas" out of range. The French then broke off their pursuit. Hood transferred Smith to command , Captain Nott having been killed in the battle, and placed John Davall Burr in command of "Pocahontas".
Burr commissioned her and on 28 May she was renamed "Pacahunta". Admiral Rodney did not confirm Burr's appointment and Burr transferred to the sloop .
Commander Alexander Inglis Cochrane replaced Burr.
In December Commander Isaac Coffin, of HMS "Avenger" exchanged ships with Cochrane and took command of "Pacahunter" in New York. He then sailed her to Barbados, where her arrived in January 1782. There he joined Rear Admiral Hood in . Coffin participated in the battle of St Kitts (25-26 January) and then returned to "Pochahontas".
Some accounts placed Coffin in "Barfleur" at the battle of the Saintes, but it is not possible to confirm that.
Coffin and the crew of "Pacahunta" helped in fighting a great fire in St. John's. His service earned him the thanks of the House of Assembly.
After HMS "Santa Mónica" wrecked on Tortola on 1 April, "Pacahunta" helped convey part of her crew to Jamaica. At Jamaica Coffin was appointed to command of the 74-gun . He was confirmed in the rank of captain on 13 June.
Fate.
Commander David Gould succeeded Coffin in command of "Pachahunta". The Navy sold her at Jamaica on 26 July 1782.

Throb nightclub disaster

The Throb nightclub disaster occurred on 24 March 2000, when a stampede broke out after the detonation of a teargas canister at the Throb nightclub in Chatsworth, Durban in South Africa. There were 600 children from age 11-14 celebrating the end of term. The incident resulted with deaths of 13 children and 100 injured. The youngest to die in the accident was 11 years old.
Case.
Vincent Pillay, Selvan Naidoo, and Sivanthan Chetty were accused for the incident and were put behind bars after the trial. According to two of the accused, they admitted their involvement in the Durban High Court. Naidoo confessed that he put the canister behind the speakers after Pillay smuggled it inside the club. He said he was offered R5,000 (about US$1,000 at the time) and a job at Silver Slipper Club by Chetty, the manager there.
Chatsworth Youth Center.
The Chatsworth Youth Center was opened in 2003 by Nelson Mandela in the memory of the 13 children who died in the incident.

2021 Rugby League World Cup qualifying

The 2021 Rugby League World Cup qualifying process began in June 2018 with the commencement of the 2018 Rugby League European Championship C tournament. Of the 16 nations that will compete in the World Cup, eight were granted automatic qualification, having reached the quarter finals of the 2017 World Cup. The remaining eight places were decided through a qualifying process.
Qualifying process.
In October 2016, England was announced as the host the tournament, granting them automatic qualification.
In March 2017, the RLIF confirmed that the 8 quarter-finalists from the 2017 World Cup would receive automatic qualification to the 2021 tournament, along with details of how many slots each region will be allocated: "Seven teams will be qualified from Europe, six from the Asia-Pacific, two from the Americas, and one from a play-off series hosted in Middle East/Africa." Because Lebanon gained automatic qualification, a repechage play-off between the 2nd placed Middle East/Africa team (behind Lebanon), 2nd placed Americas team (behind the Americas qualifying team), and the 7th placed Asia-Pacific team (behind the 6 auto qualifiers) will take place instead of qualifying 2 Americas teams.
The RLIF requires participating nations to hold full or affiliate level membership. The Netherlands are the only such nation that opted to not participate.
Europe.
England are the only European team to have been guaranteed qualification, with France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales all failing to reach the quarter finals of the 2017 World Cup. With the World Cup expanding to 16 teams in 2021, one extra European slot is available in comparison to the 2017 tournament. 
Preliminary rounds.
While the elite division of the 2018 European Rugby League Championship will see the top two teams qualify directly for the World Cup, the other European places will be decided in a play-off containing team from each level of the Championship.
The 2018 European Championship C will progress 1 team to the European play-off, the winner of the Championship C final between Norway and Greece. The 2018 European Championship B will progress 2 teams to the European play-off, Russia and Spain. These three teams will be joined by Italy, and the third and fourth place teams from the elite division.
First round.
The 2018 European Championship will automatically qualify 2 teams to the World Cup, the bottom two nations will become the top seeds in the 2019 final European qualifying tournament.
Second round.
The European play-off tournament will qualify four teams to the World Cup. It is scheduled for October and November 2019 and will consist of:
The six teams will be split into two round-robin pools. The winners and runner-up in each pool will qualify for the 2021 World Cup. There will be no European qualification to the intercontinental play-off.
Pool A
&lt;section end=GroupA /&gt;
Pool B
&lt;section begin=GroupB /&gt;
&lt;section end=GroupA /&gt;
&lt;section end=GroupB /&gt;
Americas.
The Americas group comprised four teams and was played as a single elimination knock-out tournament. won the group beating in the first round and then in the final. qualified for the intercontinental play-off by finishing as the runner-up of the tournament.
Repechage.
The intercontinental play-off will consist of the Americas championship runner up (United States), 7th highest ranked Asia-Pacific team (Cook Islands), and the 2nd highest ranked Middle East-Africa team (South Africa).

The Cutting Room Floor (website)

"The Cutting Room Floor" (TCRF) is a website dedicated to the cataloguing of unused content and leftover debugging material in video games. The site and its discoveries have been referenced in the gaming press.
The site started out as part of a blog but was reworked and relaunched as a wiki in 2010. The reworked site is considered by "Edge" to be a major catalogue of unused video game content.
History.
"The Cutting Room Floor" was started by Robert Flory in 2002 as part of a blog. It mainly focused on Nintendo Entertainment System games and was occasionally updated. In the late 2000s, Alex Workman, better known as Xkeeper, reworked the site into a wiki, which launched on 2 February 2010. The site has since specialised ("Kotaku" described them as "routinely responsible" for it) in what gaming media (including "Edge") have likened to video game archaeology: its members analyse video game code and content using various tools (such as debuggers and hex editors) and if something interesting is found, an "uncover" starts. According to Xkeeper, the site's members co-operatively analyse their findings to work out how to re-enable content. The site's goal is to catalogue "as many deleted elements as possible from all sorts of games".
In December 2013, "Edge" considered "The Cutting Room Floor" to be the largest and best-organised catalogue of unused video game content. Around this time, the site had 3712 articles. In June 2016, Xkeeper said that the website has largely avoided copyright issues.
Amongst the more noted discoveries are the secret menus in the "Mortal Kombat" games, and "The Legend of Zelda" prototype (which was "extensively" catalogued and a "The Cutting Room Floor" moderator GoldS considers the site's most important article). "The Cutting Room Floor"s community are reported to have paid 700 dollars for an unreleased Nintendo DS "Tetris" prototype. A coding error in "Super Mario Bros." that changed the behaviour of the Spiny eggs also made the gaming press. In May 2018, "Kotaku" and "Eurogamer" reported on a "Pokémon Gold and Silver" prototype and its assets that had been documented on the website.
Other material catalogued include hidden messages and regional and revisional differences (differences between versions and ports).

Heinrich of Meissen (died 24 June 1240) was Bishop of Meissen from December 1228 to his death.
Heinrich was probably a member of the Von Plaue family, ministeriales of the Archbishop of Magdeburg. Before his elevation, he was provost of the Magdeburg Cathedral chapter. He seems to have enjoyed the favour of the Emperor Frederick II, who granted him the rights to the metal mines discovered within the boundaries of the church of Meissen, as well as to auriferous, or gold-bearing, rivers and bodies of waters: in the deed of grant the Emperor refers to the bishop as "dilectus princeps" ("beloved prince"). (There is however no extant original of this deed, and some authorities consider it a forgery, for example, Hubert Ermisch).
In 1237 Heinrich was with the Emperor on his campaign to Brescia, preparatory to the Siege of Brescia in the following year.

Thomas Shanks (politician)

Thomas Shanks (July 15, 1796 – May 7, 1849) was an American slave owner and politician who won three elections to represent Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates.
Early and family life.
Born near what would become Amsterdam, Virginia, Thomas Shanks was the son of the former Hannah Morrison and her husband David Shanks. Thomas Shanks survived two wives. He married Grace Metcalfe Thomas (1795–1833) in 1825, and she bore two daughters and a son who survived their parents. Five years after her death, Thomas Shanks married widow Mary T. Harvey Kyle (1797–1845) on June 16, 1838, but had no further children in the seven years before her death.
Career.
Botetourt County voters first elected Shanks to represent them (part-time) as one of Botetourt County's two representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1829. He temporarily unseated veteran politician and lawyer Fleming B. Miller and served alongside lawyer and manufacturer John T. Anderson, who would become a veteran legislator. Nearly a decade later, in 1837, Botetourt County voters elected Shanks once again as one of their delegates, this time alongside Whig and fellow slaveowner William M. Peyton, and re-elected both men that fall, although the following year a census realignment cut the county's representation to just one man, Joseph Hannah.
Thomas Shanks may have been a merchant (or even a slave trader), for the "New and Comprehensive Gazetteer of Virginia" published by Joseph Martin in 1835 described six mercantile establishments in Fincastle, as well as 3 churches and 260 homes. One of the general stores was run by Kyles, another by Utz and Hannah, and another by Shanks and Anderson. However, Thomas Shanks' name does not appear in the 1830 U.S. federal census (the enumerator found only David, Christian and Lewis Shanks in Botetourt County). In the 1840 U.S. Federal census, the last before his death as well as the last before listing occupations, Thomas Shanks appears on both the Fincastle page (as head of a household consisting of 4 free white persons and 11 slaves, mostly female), as well as on the general Botetourt County census enumeration (as owning 36 enslaved males).
Death.
Thomas Shanks died on May 7, 1849 (aged 52) and is buried at the Fincastle Presbyterian Church cemetery. His son, Rev. David William Shanks (1830–1894), would receive a degree from Washington College, become a minister in Rockbridge County and later in Danville, survive the American Civil War and likewise marry twice. Thomas Shanks' two daughters who survived him were: Grace Ellen Shanks Glasgow (1826–1897) (second wife of William A. Glasgow and both of whose sons would graduate from Washington and Lee University and become lawyers) and Eliza Cassandra Shanks McPheeters (1827–1872). Rev. D.W. Shanks neither owned slaves nor enlisted in the military, and in addition to his sons Lewis and David Shanks, had three long-lived but unmarried daughters: Margaret Cabell Shanks (1867–1935), Eliza McPheeters Shanks (1868–1938) and Juliet Irvine Shanks (1869–1958).

Devil's Den-Ewing Mountain

Devil's Den-Ewing Mountain is a wildland in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests of western Virginia that has been recognized by the Wilderness Society as a special place worthy of protection from logging and road construction. The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a "Mountain Treasure".
Ewing Mountain, a range extending across the area, includes Devil's Den on the west and Chestnut Knob on the east. Raven Cliff, a unique geological site on the north., is the home of ravens, ospreys and other birdlife.
The area is part of the "Mount Rogers Cluster".
Location and access.
The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 3 miles east of Cripple Creek, Virginia, between Va 602 on the west and south, and Va 94 on the east and Va 642 on the north.
Trails and roads into the area include:
Decommissioned Trails:
The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 786. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page.
Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Devils's Den-Ewing Mountain wild area is covered by USGS topographic maps "Cripple Creek" and "Austinsville".
Natural history.
The area contains part of the Raven Cliff special biological area, with sensitive karst lands, a dry calcareous forest and habitat for flora such as the Carolina saxifrage and fauna such as ravens, ospreys, peregrine falcons, and wood ducks. Karst features around the Raven Cliff and lower part of Cove Creek contain disappearing streams, sinkholes, and reappearing streams. Karst sites are of interest because of the biological communities they contain.
Cripple Creek, a tributary of the New River, is a candidate for state scenic river designation. It contains cool water fish such as smallmouth bass, bluegill, and rockbass.
There are large areas of Catawba rhododendron pink-colored flowers in the spring.
Topography.
The dominant feature of the area is Ewing Mountain, a long ridge with a maximum elevation of 3038 feet. Other peaks include Devil's Den, 3153 elevation; Chestnut Knob, 3366 feet elevation; and Raven Cliff at 2241 feet. Mikes Gap is on the north side of Ewing mountain with an elevation of 2844 feet. These formations rise above Cripple Creek on the north at 1975 feet elevation.
The area contains two relatively remote areas, one on the west by Devil's Den and the other on the east near Chestnut Knob. The Devil's Den-Ewing Mountain wild area surrounds 400-acre Collins Cove, a private land holding in a pastoral valley with a few buildings.
Forest Service management.
In a review of the area in 1999, the Forest Service recognized the 4,234 semi-primitive core area, but it was not included in its roadless inventory. Later the Forest Service raised concerns that the area no longer had a semi-primitive core because of development in the inholding at Collins Cove. Inclusion in the roadless inventory would have limited road construction, reducing the negative environmental impact of roads.
There have been two recent logging projects in the area. In 2003, the Cripple Creek-Grouse Timber Sale was approved for 99 acres of clear-cutting with the construction 2.3 miles of new road and development of 3.2 miles of other roads. The sale was completed in 2009. In 2008 the forest Service approved the Fry Hill timber project with 162 acres of which 32 acres were within the Devils Den-Ewing Mountain area.

Betty Dubiner

Betty Dubiner (, 3 June 1912 – 15 February 2008) was a Canadian-born Israeli, who was instrumental in obtaining vaccines for the new nation of Israel to combat a polio epidemic and the development of programs to assist the disabled. Founder of the organization "Ilenshil-Polio", which later became the Israeli Association for Children with Disabilities (ILAN) and the Israel Sports Center for the Disabled, she was recognized with the in 1988, for her contributions to Israeli society.
Early life.
Betty Vivian Zimmerman was born on 3 June 1912, in London, Ontario, Canada to Bessie Z. (née Sickind) and Alexander Zimmerman. Her mother, died upon Zimmerman's birth and her father, traveled often as a salesman. She was raised by an aunt and uncle in Ontario and began a modeling career in Toronto. For a period prior to her marriage, she lived in New York City as worked as a buyer for a fashion company. On 30 June 1935 in Hamilton, Ontario, she married Samuel Dubiner, a toy manufacturer. In Canada, the couple were active in Betar and were involved in the Canadian League for a Free Palestine.
Activism.
In 1949, Sam opened a plastics factory in Israel and the couple moved permanently to Tel Aviv in 1950. He branched out his industrial development, opening a factory which produced boxes and containers for shipping exported goods. Dubiner designed containers for his company and received a US patent on one of her designs. Almost immediately upon their arrival, the couple enrolled in an ulpan for an immersion in Israeli culture and language. At the school, they learned of transit tent-camps and when a winter storm upended the temporary shelters, the Dubiners drove to the camps and transported refugees to safer housing. With the outbreak of the polio epidemic in 1950, Dubiner created the first volunteer organization in Israel, establishing "Ilenshil-Polio" to assist in the treatment of victims of the disease in 1952. She was responsible for bringing the polio vaccine to Israel, as well as orthopedic braces to assist in rehabilitation. Holding fundraisers and recruiting volunteers, Dubiner established training centers for the treatment and therapy of victims and resource outreaches for their families.
As head of the organization, Dubiner initiated an annual March of Dimes campaign in 1958 to raise funds for "Ilenshil-Polio", which was later renamed Israeli Association for Children with Disabilities (ILAN). ILAN spread throughout the nation and by 1988 was operating in 70 locations. Hosting summer camps and sporting events for paralyzed children, Dubiner and Gershon Huberman conceived of a plan to build a permanent facility. In 1960, she drove for the creation of the Bella and Samuel Spewack Sport Center in Ramat Gan to serve as a recreational and therapeutic center for disabled children and adults. The center was originally named after the benefactors who donated the royalties from their show "Kiss Me, Kate" to fund the building of the center.
During the Six-Day War in 1967, Dubiner, at the request of the government helped recruit hoteliers and householders to provide lodging to the pilots engaged in the campaign. As the government feared their base housing would become a target, it was necessary to find safe shelters away from the military facilities. 
In 1988, Dubiner was the recipient of the , in recognition of her work on behalf of the disabled community of Israel. That same year, the Montreal-based Canadian branch of ILAN established a home for disabled young adults in Jerusalem and were raising funds to build a kindergarten near Haifa. After her husband's death in 1993, Dubiner edited thirteen books on the history of Israel's development. An avid collector, she had clipped newspaper articles since her days in Canada. She donated her collection, "the most comprehensive archives of the history of Israel" to Ariel University.
Death and legacy.
Dubiner died on 15 February 2008 in the neighborhood of Nahalat Yitzhak, in Tel Aviv, Israel. She was buried in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery. In March 2008 a memorial was held for Dubiner with dignitaries, ILAN staff, and volunteers, to honor her contributions to the development of programs for disabled citizens in Israel.

Metallabenzene

The parent metallacyclobenzene has the formula LnM(CH)5. They can be viewed as derivatives of benzene wherein a CH center has been replaced by a transition metal complex. Most metallabenzenes do not feature the M(CH)5 ring, but instead some of the H atoms are replaced by other substituents.
Classification.
Metallabenzene complexes have been classified into three varieties; in such compounds the parent acyclic hydrocarbon ligand is viewed as the anion C5H5−. The 6 π electrons in the metallacycle conform to the Hückel (4n+2) theory.
Preparation and structure.
The first reported stable metallabenzene was the osmabenzene Os(C5H4S)CO(PPh3)2. Characteristic of other metallaarenes, the Os-C bonds are about 0.6 Å longer than the C-C bonds (in benzene these are 1.39 Å), resulting in a distortion of the hexagonal ring. 1H NMR signals for the ring protons are downfield, consistent with aromatic "ring current." Osmabenzene and its derivatives can be regarded as an Os(II), d6 octahedral complex.
Metallabenzenes have been also been characterized with metals ruthenium, iridium, platinum, and rhenium.

The hidden God

The hidden God (Latin: "Deus absconditus") refers to the Christian idea of the fundamental unknowability of the essence of God. The name comes from the Bible, specifically from the book of Isaiah: "Indeed, you are a hidden God, you God of Israel, the Savior." (45:15). This concept was particularly important for the thinking of Nicholas of Cusa, Blaise Pascal, John Calvin and Martin Luther.
Luther unfolded his views on "Deus absconditus" in his Latin work "De servo arbitrio" in 1525. But he had already hinted at this idea in his lectures on the Psalms and in his lecture on Romans ten years earlier. The opposite of "Deus absconditus" in Lutheran theology is "Deus revelatus" (the revealed God).

Take Your Pills

Take Your Pills is an hour-long American documentary from 2018, directed by Alison Klayman and produced by Motto Pictures and Netflix Studios. The documentary explores the positives and negatives of taking psychostimulant medications, such as Adderall—the main focus of the documentary. The film is a series of interviews with college students and working adults who are prescribed stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with parents who touch on the difficulties raising children with ADHD and interviews with professionals commenting on the use of stimulants.
Those interviewed include former player for the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars Eben Britton, and neuroscientist Anjan Chatterjee. The film’s executive producers were Maria Shriver and Christina Schwarzenegger; its world premiere was at the SXSW film festival in 2018.
Plot.
The documentary begins by introducing the interviewees, giving some background and how they are associated with Adderall or stimulant medications. The film interviews people from different backgrounds and phases in life, from college students and children, to former NFL players, to psychologists. While the health professionals discuss the history of stimulant use and their opinions, other interviewees speak of their personal experience with the medications. There are also some family members that speak of noticeable changes caused by the medications.
Cast and synopsis.
Jasper Holt is a college senior who has been taking Adderall since his ADHD diagnosis at the age of six. He attended a private school that he says recommended medication. His mom was worried that the medication would hinder his creative side, but he is still very much into art. Holt says he was embarrassed for taking the medication when he was in high school, and is trying to lower his dosage to eventually stop taking it.
Delaney is a college junior who was prescribed Adderall. She describes it as "Rx gold" that "sews up" your life. Her standpoint is that she needs it to hold her life together, she claims that other people had tutors in high school to prepare for the standardized tests, and her parents couldn't afford tutors so she resorted to Adderall. She says she uses it to give her a leg up in comparison to other students.
Rahiem is a high school student who was diagnosed with ADHD when he was very young. He was prescribed Adderall and forewarned of the effects if he did take his medication. His mother was mostly interviewed; she said she saw a noticeable improvement in his behavior when he takes his medication. 
Eben Britton is a former NFL player who was prescribed Adderall. He speaks of his experience with the medication as a user who abused it. He admits that he didn't believe he had ADHD, it was just an easy way to have an open access to the drugs in order to enhance his performance and deal with the pain from his injuries. His wife stated that when he started on the medication everything seemed great, he had the time and energy to be a husband and an NFL player, but as time went on he began to overuse the medication. He claims he is addicted to the medication just to be the best in a very competitive environment.
Blue Williams is an artist manager, who takes Adderall on occasion. He was diagnosed as a child with ADHD, but his mother did not let him take any medication as she wanted him to adapt to the world. Now as an adult he chooses to use medication on days where he has a lot going on. He states that in modern-day life, there are many distractions that come with technology, and young adults interpret these distractions to believe that they have ADHD, which then leads to their diagnosis and medication.
Health professionals.
Corey Herbert is a physician who practices in New Orleans. He speaks on the topic of stimulants and compares patients like Raheim who need the drugs and others who have slightly less severe cases.
Wendy Brown is a political theorist from UC Berkeley, who discusses reasons college students and adults may resort to stimulants. She states that the world is a hypercompetitive environment, from students trying to get into the best schools to workers being pushed to work many hours, where many don't know how to cope or how to stay on top with using medication to enhance their performance.
Martha Farah is a cognitive neuroscientist from the University of Pennsylvania. She discussed the history of psychostimulant medication, and some of the controversies as well. She mentioned the incorrect belief that medication will make the consumer smarter, and claimed this theory was wrong.

Matthew Piskorz and Lucas Siegel are the co-founders of Alternascript, a company that creates supplements. Their ideology is that if students are trying to get ahead by taking prescription drugs, then there should be legal supplements others can take to level the playing field.
Reception.
David Ehrlich reviewed the documentary for IndieWire, writing that the film "never finds its focus", describing the director as approaching the topic with the "reactionary zeal of a local TV news segment" in a comprehensive but "myopic" look at the use of prescription amphetamines. Ehrlich says Klayman uses "scare-mongering tactics", and he criticizes the filming technique as a "tired attempt to conflate ADHD with a video game aesthetic and a pixelated cartoon of a skeleton drowning in little blue pills". 
Devon Frye writes in ADDitude Magazine that the documentary is a "heavy-handed" and "biased portrait of stimulant use in America", in which Klayman demonstrates "little interest in showing both sides of the story" while focusing on medication users who "openly admit to taking the drugs to get ahead in a culture that constantly demands more". Frye states that the film explores questions that are worthy, but fails to deliver answers to those questions by focusing on unsympathetic characters and by relying on "jarring animations and repetitive interviews".
Reviewing the documentary for "Variety" magazine, Owen Gleiberman calls the film "urgent" and "eye-opening". Gleiberman writes that the connections made by the movie's thesis "may strike some as too speculative for comfort", but they can "fire up your perceptions enough to burn through the cumulative effects of advertising". Justin Lowe, film critic for "The Hollywood Reporter", writes that some of interviewees have interesting stories, but the "talking-head experts" and the animated and archived film sequences are sluggish. He states that the film relies heavily on anecdote but is light on data and documentation, and fails to make its case.

Heroes for life

Heroes for Life (in Hebrew: לוחמים ללא גבולות) is a non-governmental organization founded in 2013 by three officers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who had served in the Duvdevan unit for eight years. They started a trip after performing military service together, a trip that the IDF soldiers normally perform after completing the military service.
History of the group.
On the day of the Jewish New Year (Rosh HaShanah), Gili, one of the three friends, stayed in a house that belonged to the Chabad Lubavitch Chassidic movement, which was located on the island of Ko Samui, in the Kingdom of Thailand, together with more than 1,500 Israeli tourists. Gili was amazed to see the tremendous number of Israeli backpackers who traveled to poor countries every year, and that was when the idea was born of using this valuable human resource to make the world a better place.
"Heroes for Life" was founded in 2013 by three officers from the Duvdevan unit who, while traveling through the Far East, encountered that many Israelis visited third world countries, and they realized the potential to use that human resource to present the nation of Israel. in a positive way through the volunteer work. The organization is chaired by the former commander of the Air Force General Eliezer Shkedi. The only condition to join a delegation of "Heroes for Life" is to volunteer first with the organization in a youth village in Israel for three days. The team is called "Danielle" in honor of Danielle Sonnenfeld, a national service volunteer who worked with children with cancer at the Schneider Medical Center, and who died in a traffic accident three years ago. The founder of the organization is named Gili Cohen. In addition to Brazil, there are delegations that go every year to countries such as: India, Nepal, South Africa, Guatemala, Mexico, Argentina and Ethiopia.
Activities of the group by country.
Africa.
Ethiopia.
In March 2017, Heroes for life expanded its voluntary activity to the nation of Ethiopia. The first delegation went there in March, and stayed in the country two weeks. In that expedition, the volunteers worked with kids. The activities included the teaching of English, mathematics, dental health, and music. They also participate in the renovation of a shelter that was located near the city of Gondar, in the northern region of Ethiopia. Besides the program of the volunteers, the delegation also counted with a dentist that provided dental care for the children of the shelter, that needed medical assistance. The expedition counted with the cooperation of a local Ethiopian NGO, and also the collaboration of the Israeli NGO "Eden".
South Africa.
In March 2018, the backpackers arrived in South Africa and stayed there two weeks to perform humanitarian work and educational activities with the poor children of the city. The volunteers taught them arithmetic, music and English. The backpackers contributed to the renovation and improvement of the living conditions of the children, collaborating in agricultural projects and painting residential buildings. In addition to working with the children of the neighborhood, the weekends are dedicated to volunteer work with the South African Jewish community.
America.
Argentina.
Every year in December, the backpacker volunteers organize an expedition to the neighborhood of San Fernando in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The mission of the volunteers last two weeks, and during that period of time they are concentrated in performing several educational activities with the kids of the neighbourhood. Every expedition is formed by a group that has between 20 and 25 volunteers. The work of the volunteers is divided in to teams, the shift of the morning is dedicated mainly to carry out several projects of painting and restoration, that are designed and executed by the backpacker volunteers (for instance: the delegation of the year 2015 built a dining room for the children of the neighbourhood) in second place, the shift of the afternoon is dedicated to teach the kids several themes like: English, mathematics, music, personal values, and dental care. One of the principles of the group is the continuity of work made by every delegation, each expedition works with the same kids than the previous delegations, creating a beautiful and valuable link with the local population. The volunteer missions in the Argentinian Republic, started in the year 2015, with the coming into the country of the team "Oz", and in 2017 it was the third time that the project had place in the quarter. Besides the activities performed with the kids of the neighbourhood during the week, the weekends are dedicated to strengthen the bons with the local Jewish community in Argentina. This activity has place together with the Maccabi movement in Argentina, and is directed to the youth of the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. The name of the team "Oz", is dedicated to the memory of the sergeant Oz Mendelovic, who died in the Gaza strip during the military operation Protective edge].
Brazil.
25 Israeli backpackers on their trip after the army, most of them veterans of the IDF combat units, decided to volunteer in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and teach local children English and mathematics and renovate the community institutions as part of the "Heroes for Life" program. One of the volunteers, Lior Tabib, is a former Israeli Air Force officer who lost his friend, the captain Tal Nachman in 2014 in Gaza. The two had planned to travel together through South America, and Lior decided to join the delegation in memory of his friend. Captain Nachman was killed in a fire during operations at the Gaza border four years ago, when a soldier from the Givati reconnaissance battalion accidentally shot him after mistaking him for a terrorist. At the beginning, Lior and his colleagues worked in the favela of Cantagalo, and recently moved to another location in a community center in the neighborhood of Pavuna, which is on the outskirts of the city and surrounded by favelas. Every day, Lior and his friends teach classes in different subjects for local children with the help of members of the Jewish community in the city, who serve as interpreters. The volunteers are also helping to renovate the community center in the neighborhood.

Device neutrality

Device neutrality law states that the users have the right of non-discrimination of the services and apps they use, based on platform control by hardware companies.
The term device neutrality is closely connected to net neutrality, and shares a correlation. Net neutrality is a concept that ensures equal access to the internet and Device neutrality is a concept that ensures equal access to applications. In order to achieve an Open Internet, it is necessary that all Internet access layers remain open for competition, i.e., not only the network access layer (which is the focus of net neutrality), but also the application and operating system access layers (which is the focus of device neutrality).
History and effects.
The concept was first proposed in Italy in 2014. Member of the Italian Parliament Stefano Quintarelli proposed a bill which states that users should be free to access content and use the applications they wish, provided they are legal, they do not impair safety and security, and they are not in violation of other laws or court orders.
A limitation of this freedom by device manufacturers should be examinable on the grounds of anti consumeristic behaviour. 
A similar proposal was made by ARCEP, the French regulator for electronic communications, in February 2018.
The Android operating system supports installation of third party software on the devices beyond the Google Play store, albeit with complications and hurdles for the user, whereas Apple Inc. restricts the third party installation of applications.  
After a long and in depth-examination and approval by all committees of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate, at the verge of the final vote, some articles in mainstream press argued the proposed bill had potential to ban the use of iPhones in Italy while international news outlets and commentators held a less dramatic stand. 
In an October 2016 letter from Apple's General Counsel to Spotify, Apple threatened to remove Spotify's app from the App Store for advertising free trials to its own customers. Apple decreed: “What a developer cannot do is seek to use its iOS app as a marketing tool to redirect consumers outside of the app to avoid in-app purchase”.
In 2019 the presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has embraced Device Neutrality calling for a structural separation of the Apple Computer's app store from the device manufacturing business to allow app installation from other sources, like competing App stores.
In January 2020 a group of 53 consumer rights and privacy advocacy organizations signed an open letter to Google asking for the right to completely uninstall preinstalled applications.
In August 2020 Apple pulled off the popular Fortnite game by Epic Games from the App Store in retaliation for Epic's refusal to remove an in-app purchase capability alternative to Apple's own payment system which exacts a 30% toll from all payments. Epic denounced Apple's behaviour launching the #FreeFortnite campaign with a parody of the famous 1984 advertisement video that featured Apple as the new Big Brother, and initiating a legal action against what they deem anti-competitive restrictions on mobile device marketplaces.
On December 15, 2020 European Union Vice President Margrethe Vestager and Commissioner Thierry Breton announced the inclusion of Device Neutrality provisions in the final draft of the Digital Markets Act, the new regulation that will regulate digital services in the European Union.
The proposed regulation includes 10 detailed provisions:
In South Korea regulators established non-binding recommendations for pre-installed apps to be removable. Meanwhile, in Russia, Android has already been fined for continuing to pre-install its associated Google Apps, and the outgoing chief of the Indian telecom’s regulator has suggested device neutrality is necessary to keep the ecosystem lively.

The Special Chancellery

The Special Chancellery was a unit of Russian foreign intelligence in the beginning of the 19th century, serving the reign of Alexander I of Russia during the Napoleonic wars. The Special Chancellery participated in the two years prior to and during the French Invasion of Russia in 1812. The Special Chancellery operated under the Minister of War. The Minister of War at the time, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, created the Special Chancellery in 1812. The Special Chancellery’s mission was to gather intelligence on the political activity, military activity, and economy of European states that were a potential enemy of Russia, particularly France. Its operations focused on strategic intelligence, operational and tactical intelligence, and counterintelligence. The Special Chancellery is known to be the birth of counterespionage in Russia.
History.
Barclay de Tolly began organizing the program for the Special Chancellery in 1810 when he received the appointment of Minister of War. He had served for years in the Russian army and Alexander deemed him a more experienced and tactical military strategist than his predecessor, General Alexander Arakcheev. As a result, Tsar Alexander appointed him as the Minister of War on the 18th of January, 1810, when relations between Russia and France began to increase in tension. Through Barclay de Tolly’s experience as a Field Marshal on the battlefield, he identified the need for Russia’s military to have timely and accurate intelligence on the enemy’s intentions, movements, and capabilities. The same month Barclay de Tolly was appointed the Minister of War, he sent Alexander an outlined proposal for an intelligence program that would consist of high ranking Russian military officers to be sent to Russian embassies in Europe under the guise of military attaches to collect and send intelligence back to headquarters in St. Petersburg. Tsar Alexander accepted the proposal, and the organization for the group that came to be known as the Special Chancellery began.
Organization.
As a covert organization with classified missions, the Special Chancellery was a small group. The entire organization consisted of Barclay de Tolly as the Minister of Defense, a director of the Special Chancellery or aide-de-camp, three expeditors, a translator, and seven intelligence agents.
When Barclay first began organizing the Special Chancellery in 1810, he appointed Colonel Alexei Voyeikov to be his aid-de-camp. During the war of 1812, Barclay de Tolly became the supreme Commander of the 1st Army of the West, the major army that was Napoleon in Russia. He appointed Voyeikov, who had been in the Russian military since 1799, to handle the intelligence coming in from the agents in Europe. However, in 1812, he was dismissed and Colonel Arseny Zakrevsky took his position.
Special Chancellery Intelligence Officers.
Barclay de Tolly sent military officers to various Russian embassies in Europe with the official status of being attaches. Barclay de Tolly had seven officers operating under his command: Lieutenant Alexander Chernyshyov, Lieutenant G.F. Orlov, Colonel F.V. Teil Von Seraskerken, Colonel R.E. Renin, Lieutenant P.I. Brozin, Lieutenant P.H. Grabbe, and Major V.A. Prendel. Chernyshev had the most responsibility as he headed the Russian intelligence operations in Paris, Orlov and Renin were both stationed in Berlin, and Brozin was in Madrid. Teil Von Seraskerken was in Vienna, Grabbe collected intelligence in Munich, while Prendel was stationed in Dresden. 
Special Chancellery Operations in France.
As a Russian military officer who had gained recognition for his military exploits, Alexander Chernyshyov seemed to be the most qualified officer to represent the Special Chancellery in Paris, France. In Paris, Chernyshyov created an extensive network within French nobility, maintain relationships with nobles such as Carolina, the Queen of Naples and Napoleon’s own sister. Chernyshyov himself had a network of spies in the French government and military that provided him with bi-weekly reports on topics such as troop activities, locations, and strengths. His most famous informant was a French soldier named Michele, who had been an informant for Russia since 1804. Michele and the other informants would give Chernyshyov a report every 2 weeks for a lump sum, which Chernyshyov would translate and send to St. Petersburg for Barclay de Tolly to brief Tsar Alexander. Chernyshyov would also provide profiles of Napoleon’s top generals in the reports in addition to the intelligence on the French troops.

Leptokarya railway station

Leptokarya railway station () is a railway station in Leptokarya, a town in Pieria, Central Macedonia, Greece. The station is located in a residential area, close to the town centre, and is also the closest active station to Mount Olympus National Monument, and sits in the showdown of the ancient landmark.
History.
The station was built in 1916. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971 the station, and most of Greek rail infrastructure where transferred to the "Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.", a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. In 2004 the station and the line closed as part of the upgrades to the Piraeus–Platy Line. The station reopened on 7 September 2008, as part of the rollout of Proastiakos services. Since 2008, the station is served by the Proastiakos Thessaloniki services to New Railway Station. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE.
Facilities.
The station is staffed, with a working ticket office (as of 2020) and has a restaurant. The station currently has three platforms, however only two are currently in regular use.
Services.
It is served by local stopping services to Thessaloniki, Kalambaka and Palaiofarsalos. Since 2008, it has been served by Proastiakos Thessaloniki to Larissa and Thessaloniki.

Flapjack River

The Flapjack River is a tributary of the Mattawa Bay of the Southwest of Gouin Reservoir, flowing into the town of La Tuque, into the administrative area of the Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.
The Flapjack River flows successively into the townships of Buies, Provencher and Poisson. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
Forest Road R1009 intersects the lower Flapjack River watershed approximately one kilometre upstream of the mouth of the river. This road serves the western part of the Gouin Reservoir and connects to the Southeast to the R0404 Forest Road. Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of the Flapjack River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice movement is generally from early December to late March.
Toponymy.
The term "flapjack" refers to a cake of British origin, resembling an energy bar. The main ingredients are: oat flakes, butter, brown sugar and golden syrup.
The toponym "Flapjack River" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Crypt TV

Crypt TV is an American entertainment company focused on developing, producing and distributing horror themed digital content, with an emphasis on monsters and recurring characters in linked universes. It was founded by Jack Davis and Eli Roth in 2015 and backed by Jason Blum and Blumhouse Productions.
Crypt specializes in short-form horror videos made for the internet, including viral characters such as the Birch and the Look-See. The company has a combined social media following of 5 million likes on Facebook and 3.41 million subscribers on YouTube.
History.
Jack Davis, who was still attending Duke University at the time, met Eli Roth at a dinner party in 2013. The pair kept in touch, discussing how to make scary entertainment effective on phone screens. Crypt TV was formed when Davis and Roth launched a "six-second scare" contest together in October 2014, as "a way to test to see if you could really make great scary content in short form on mobile,” according to Davis. The contest was featured on Good Morning America and subsequently went viral, receiving over 15,000 submissions. Roth showed the contest to Jason Blum, who was looking for a digital strategy for Blumhouse Productions, and Blum became Crypt's first investor. The company was officially launched in April 2015 in Los Angeles with just three employees: Davis, Darren Brandl as Chief Operating Officer, and Kate Krantz as Chief Content Officer.
In March 2017, Crypt TV raised $3.5 million in funding, led by venture capital fund Lerer Hippeau Ventures, a backer of Buzzfeed. The company has raised $6.2 million from past investors.
In May 2021, Crypt TV licenses made their first appearance in a video game, with three characters appearing as third-party downloadable content skins in the game "Dead by Daylight" by Behaviour Interactive.
Intellectual property.
Crypt releases about 100 videos every three months, building its audience through Facebook and YouTube and averaging more than 100 million online views a month. Using real-time reactions on social media to test characters and concepts, the most well-received characters are inducted into Crypt's "monster universe," who then form the basis for as many as 15 videos in a quarter. Giggles the Clown, The Look-See, and Sunny Family Cult are among the most popular series developed this way.
Crypt's viral characters expand beyond traditional narrative videos; Giggles the Clown does live streaming interviews with fans, engaging on social media as a typical influencer would, and she has appeared as an attraction at Knott's Scary Farm. Crypt also has a merchandising deal with Spencer's Gifts, which sells merchandise for Giggles, the Birch, and Sunny Family Cult.
"The Birch".
"The Birch" is a short film on Crypt TV that has gathered the most views of anything on the channel. It is about a sentient tree who protects a kid from bullies, produced by Crypt TV in 2016. The short was written and directed by Anthony Melton and Ben Franklin, and The Birch creature design was created by special effects artist, Cliff Wallace. The film went viral, winning a Webby award in 2017. The Birch has recently been expanded and developed into a full-fledged Crypt universe character in its own Facebook Miniseries.
"The Look-See".
"The Look-See" is a popular horror web series based on a short by the same name. The series is about a sharp-toothed grinning demonic entity that puts his chosen victims to potentially fatal tests, victims have to choose to let go of a specific item or person that they have held on to for a long time, failure to release that specific item will end in the victim's death. The character and series were created by Landon Stahmer.
"My First Day".
"My First Day" is a darkly comedic horror short about a demented child who gets accepted into a private school for young aspiring serial killers. The short was written and directed by Jon Kovel. The short went viral and was shown at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival as part of an horror anthology entitled, "Crypt TV's Monster Madness." 
"Sunny Family Cult".
"Sunny Family Cult" is a popular horror drama web series based on a short by the same name. The show centers around a teenager named Taylor who strives for a normal life while juggling her not-so-normal serial killing cult family. Featuring actors such as Trew Mullen, Russell Cummings, Stephanie Estes and others. Episodes have been directed by Gabriel Younes, and John Ross.
"The Thing in the Apartment".
"The Thing in the Apartment" is a popular horror short from 2015 about two women who must confront a terrifying creature lurking in the shadows of a flat. The short was written and directed by John Ross. In 2017 it was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival as part of an horror anthology entitled, "Crypt TV's Monster Madness," and was featured as part of the Chiller Network's "Slice of Summer." It spawned a 2017 sequel, "The Thing in the Apartment: Part II."

Aleutian subduction zone

The Aleutian subduction zone is a long convergent boundary between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate, that extends from the Alaska Range to the Kamchatka Peninsula. Here, the Pacific Plate is being subducted underneath the North American Plate and the rate of subduction changes from west to east from per year. The Aleutian subduction zone includes two prominent features, the Aleutian Arc and the Aleutian Trench. The Aleutian Arc was created via volcanic eruptions from dehydration of the subducting slab at ~100 km depth. The Aleutian Trench is a narrow and deep morphology that occurs between the two converging plates as the subducting slab dives beneath the overriding plate.
Geological history.
The Aleutian island arc formed ~50-55 ma as a result of Kula Plate subduction under the North American Plate before the Pacific plate arrived. There are three stratigraphic units of the Aleutian island arc: volcanic rocks from ~55-33 ma, marine sedimentary rocks from ~23-33 ma, and sedimentary and igneous rocks from ~5 ma-present. Volcanic rocks from ~55-33 ma include sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, and breccia that are all volcanic, and they are mixed with pillow lavas in a complex way. Debris flows and turbidity currents transported igneous materials from volcanic source to shallow marine basins. The majority of the volcanism occurred between ~ 56-34 ma along the island arcs.
Island arc.
The Aleutian island arc crust in Alaska is ~25 km thick, and has a volume of ~2300 km3 per kilometer of the arc. Seismic reflection and refraction surveys indicate that the composition of the Aleutian island arc is not similar to the composition of continental crust. Relatively high p-wave velocities indicate mafic rocks are present and this is verified in the geology of the crust. In the upper crust, there is ~6 km of basaltic andesite, while the middle crust is composed of 5 km-thick mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), and 19 km- thick tholeiitic residue in the lower crust. Continental crusts usually have silicic upper crust and reflective lower crust, but these features are not found in the Aleutian arc.
Magmatism.
There are 40 active volcanoes in the Aleutian volcanic arc from the Mt. Spurr in mainland Alaska to Buldir Island in the far west Aleutian islands. The list of volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc could be found here. The eastern end of the volcanic arc on the Alaska Peninsula lies on Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, with trace amounts of Paleozoic rocks intruded by Mesozoic batholiths. Most of the Aleutian Islands are composed of sedimentary rocks from granitic and metamorphic rocks from Oligocene-Miocene. There are Quaternary volcanoes on the north of the Aleutian Islands structural axis, which is composed of andesite mostly, mixed with olivine basalt to rhyolite. The eastern Aleutian volcanoes have more silicic magma while the western Aleutian arcs lack the sial magma.
Trench.
Formation.
The Aleutian Trench formation is associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American plate. The horizontally-curved shape of the trench is due to the change in direction of the North American plate around ~5- 2.6 my, resulting in the movement of the Pacific Plate to the northwest. A hypothesis suggests that the northward movement of the Pacific Plate ended ~66-56 my, and the underthrusting of oceanic crust created the Aleutian trench. And yet other more complicated hypotheses exist.
There are two hypotheses in the mechanism of the trench formation: tensional and compressional. The tensional hypothesis suggests that island arc loading caused the oceanic crust to create downward faulting. In other words, the trench was a part of oceanic crust once, but faulted down at depth due to the loading of island arc. The compressional hypothesis suggests that mantle convection or drag prevented oceanic crust from reaching isostatic equilibrium, because the imbalance was not adjusted in a relatively short amount of time. As a result, deformation and plastic flow of magma released from open fractures on the concave-side of arc, drags the crust and mantle to deeper depths, and further inhibits vertical rise of magma, creating a trench.
Sedimentation in eastern Aleutian trench.
There is a high supply of sediment from turbidity currents, slumps, and creeps into the eastern portion of the Aleutian trench. The sediments accumulated here were originally part of the Alaskan Abyssal Plain. The maximum depth of the trench is 2 km, and the deposition at the maximum depth has been 10 times faster than the abyssal plain. As a result, there is a sediment wedge that is 20–30 km wide and 1 km thick has been created over ~0.6 my. These sediments are mostly Mesozoic in age, characterized by a consolidated trench deposit grading from sandstone, sandstone and shale, to abyssal turbidity sediments. The most recent addition of a high volume of sediment fill is due to Pleistocene glacial erosion.
Seismicity.
Most of the major crustal faults found in the overriding Aleutian island arc are pre-Pleistocene, although precise dating has not been achieved.
Along the megathrust, there were 5 earthquakes that were greater than magnitude 8 in the Aleutian subduction zone within the past 80+ years : M= 8.2 Shumagin Islands in 1938, M= 8.6 Andreanof Islands in 1957, M= 9.2 Good Friday in 1964, M= 8.7 Rat Islands in 1965, and M= 8.2 near Perryville in 2021 . Tremor and slow-slip earthquakes have also been observed in the Aleutian subduction zone. The low frequency earthquake (LFE) hypocenters associated with these processes are located near Kodiak Island, Shumagin Gap, Unalaska, and the Andreanof Islands, down-dip of these great megathrust events, where the two converging plates are thought to be at least partially locked. The thickness of sedimentation in the trench does not have a correlation with presence of tremor. For example, there is ~1 km-thick late Quaternary-Holocene sediment underneath Kodiak, and ~ 200 m-thick sediment underneath the Andreanof Islands. Kodiak Island had LFE epicenters at depths of 45–60 km while Andreanof Islands had epicenters at ~60–70 km depths. However, tremor does seem to occur at a specific depth related to the age of the subducting plate. The age of the subducting plate is older towards west (Andreanof Island) where LFEs occur at greater depths (~75 km) than in the east where the plate is younger (~45 km near Kodiak Island). This may be because the depths at which the hydrous minerals release water and produce tremors are greater when the plate is older, colder, and subducting faster.

SS Tellus (1911)

Tellus was a steam cargo ship built in 1911 by the William Doxford &amp; Sons of Pallion for the Wabanas Dampskibskompani, a subsidiary of Nova Scotia Steel &amp; Coal Company and managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. She was named after Tellus, the Earth goddess.
Design and Construction.
On 10 March 1911 it was reported that a new company "The Wabana Steamship Company" (Wabanas Dampskibskompani) with a capital of NOK 1,500,000 was registered in Nøtterøy with the purpose of transporting ore between Newfoundland and Europe. The new company was a subsidiary of the Nova Scotia Steel Company and was managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. Two ships were leased to conduct the operations ("SS Tellus" and "SS Themis") by the newly formed company for a period of 10 years. 
The ship was laid down in 1910 at William Doxford &amp; Sons shipyard in Pallion. The vessel was launched on 31 January 1911 (yard number 417), and the sea trials were held on 8 March 1911 with the ship being able to reach speed of . After completion of her sea trials, the ship was delivered to her owner on the same day. On 10 March 1911 "Tellus" departed from Newcastle for Narvik where the ship was scheduled to take a load of iron ore for delivery to Philadelphia. 
As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Tellus" was assessed at 7,395 GRT, and 12,925 DWT which made her the largest ship in Scandinavia at the time. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 412 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Operational history.
After completion "Tellus" loaded 11,000 tons of Swedish iron ore from the Kiruna-Luossavaara mines in Narvik and departed for her maiden journey on 18 March 1911 to Philadelphia, arriving there on 6 April. The cargo was assigned to the Warwick Iron &amp; Steel Co. of Pottstown. The vessel departed from Philadelphia on 6 May and proceeded to Wabana, a mining site for the Nova Scotia Steel Company. After loading iron ore in Newfoundland, the ship departed Wabana on 6 June for Rotterdam.
"Tellus" continued serving the Wabana-Rotterdam route through the end of 1913 during the open navigation period around Newfoundland, usually April through November. During winters, the ship was either chartered in North America to move iron ore from Wabana to Philadelphia, or to transport other cargo along the East Coast of the USA, or was engaged in iron ore shipping from Narvik and Kirkenes area to Rotterdam.
The ship experienced several accidents throughout her career. During her March 1912 trip from Narvik to Philadelphia with a cargo of iron ore she ran into some ice fields and experienced rough weather throughout her journey, arriving in Philadelphia on 16 March with some damage about the decks. After unloading the ship continued on to Tampa where she took on 7,900 tons of phosphate rock and departed on 30 March for Hamburg. On 1 May "Tellus" grounded at the entrance to the Hamburg harbor but was able to get off with assistance of 4 tugs.
On 19 February 1913 she went into Trondheim with a propeller damage, sustained possibly after hitting a submerged wreck in the water. The work was challenging since due to the size of the ship she could not fit into drydock or even the repair yard. The ship's nose had to be submerged to expose the propeller which then could be changed with the use of the repair yard crane. The ship returned in service by mid-March.
On 17 November 1913 she departed Philadelphia for Rotterdam with the largest grain cargo transported by a ship at the time. She could only load half of her cargo at Girard Point and had to get the other half at Port Richmond. Her cargo measured 51,132 quarters or 450,000 bushels of wheat.
On 5 April 1914 "Tellus" again departed Rotterdam for Wabana. The journey took almost 4 weeks and the ship came into Wabana on 29 April, leaking and with a damaged propeller which were probably caused by a collision with an iceberg. The vessel proceeded to St John's next day to conduct emergency repairs.
After the start of World War I "Tellus" could no longer be involved in her ore trade, as the main consumer of her cargo was Germany. She became a tramp ship and was chartered for any cargo that she could carry. On 31 August 1914 "Tellus" departed Norfolk carrying 10,394 tons of coal as cargo and 2,486 tons in bunkers to Piraeus. From Piraeus the ship sailed to New York City via Almeria where together with other Wilhelm Wilhelmsen's ships she was chartered by Barber Line. The vessel loaded a cargo of food supplies and copper for an Italian customer and left New York on 20 November 1914. She had to stop at Gibraltar for a British inspection where the ship was ordered to unload all copper before being allowed to proceed to Genoa on 23 December. 
After her return to New York in April 1915, "Tellus" went to South America, visiting ports of Montevideo and Buenos Aires before returning to Boston on 21 July 1915. "Tellus" departed New York for Vladivostok on 21 August 1915 with 11,500 tons of general cargo (most of it were military supplies for Russia), and passed through the Panama Canal on 2 September. The vessel called at Comox on 3 October to replenish her bunkers before departing in the early morning on 5 October, taking course to Muroran and from there on to Vladivostok. On her trip to Japan "Tellus" ran into several storms which severely slowed her down and depleted her coal reserves forcing the ship to call at Nemuro. After replenishing her coal bunkers, the ship left Nemuro early on 17 November heading to Muroran, but ran aground in stormy weather on Kaigara-jima sustaining significant damage to her bottom. Most of her cargo was unloaded and saved using lighters but due to the ship being stranded in isolated position she was not refloated until 22 January 1916 and towed to Hanasaki for repairs. "Tellus" then continued to Hakodate arriving there on 4 February 1916. After undergoing major repairs, the ship departed Hakodate on 28 March 1916, arriving at Shanghai on 2 April.
Sometime around April 1916 the ship was sold to Ole Wikborg, an owner of a marine insurance company Wikborgs Assuranceselskab based out of Drammen. The ship was renamed "Elizabeth IV" and after finishing repairs and transfer was chartered to transport sugar from East India to Europe. The ship loaded 11,173 tons of sugar in Pasuruan on Java and departed for Marseilles on 28 July 1916. The ship was under command of Captain Henrik Berg and had a crew of 46 men. "Elizabeth IV" called at Colombo on 9 August, taking 1,400 tons coal in her bunkers, and transited through the Suez Canal on 31 August.
Sinking.
"Elizabeth IV" sailed from Port Said around 18:30 on 31 August 1916 for the final leg of her trip to Marseilles. On 6 September, around 11:00, she passed by Cape Bon, and observed three patrol boats that were thought to be British. At this point the course was changed to pass about 20 miles west of Sardinia's southern tip, and from there the course was to be set straight to Marseilles. At around noon on 8 September 1916, in an approximate position , an unknown submarine (later to be determined to be German submarine ) was sighted on the vessel's portside. About 3 minutes later, the submarine hoisted an Austrian flag, and Captain Berg ordered an All Stop. About a minute later, a warning shot was fired from the submarine across the bow. "Elizabeth IV" came to a stop, and a boarding party from the submarine came on board. Once they learned the ship was heading to France, they ordered the crew to abandon ship, the lifeboats were lowered, the scuttling charges were placed on the ship's starboard side and were ignited. At around 13:45 the charges exploded, and the ship immediately began to list on her starboard side and sank bow first at 14:05. The crew was provided with directions on how to get to Capo Falcone on Sardinia, about away. At around 16:00 the lifeboats were sighted by Greek steamer "Petritzis" who took the crew on board and safely landed them at Savona in the morning of 10 September.

Vinayaditya of Podana

Vinayaditya (r. c. 750-775 CE) alias Yuddhamalla I, was an Indian ruler from the Vemulavada Chalukya dynasty. He was most probably a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga, and his capital was likely located at Podana (modern Bodhan); his successors moved the capital to Vemulavada.
Rule over Sapadalaksha.
A Vemulavada inscription states that Vinayaditya ruled over the Sapadalaksha country, which could not be governed by others. The Sanskrit term "Sapadalaksha" (or "Savalakhkhe" in vernacular, literally "125,000 [villages or revenue units]") has been used to describe several distinct regions in the early medieval Indian records, including the Sapadalaksha area in present-day Rajasthan.
Some scholars, including Kolluru Suryanarayana and N Venkataramanayya identify the Sapadalaksha of the Vemulavada inscription with the Sapadalaksha of present-day Rajasthan. According to this theory, Vinayaditya probably accompanied his overlord Dantidurga during the Rashtrakuta campaigns against the Gurjara-Pratiharas, and controlled a part of Rajasthan during the Rashtrakuta occupation of that territory. The Vemulavada inscription also credits Vinayaditya with conquering the reputedly inaccessible Chitrakuta fort, although other records of the dynasty, such as the "Vikramarjuna Vijayam" and the Parbhani copper-plate inscription, do not mention this conquest. According to Venkataramanayya, it is possible that the conquered fort was the modern Chittor Fort (originally called "Chitrakuta"), located in the ancient Sapadalaksha region.
However, other scholars, including Madhusudan Dhaky and Jaisetty Ramanaiah, identify the Sapadalaksha of the Vemulavada inscription with Kosavalam Savalakhe, a historical region in present-day Telangana. This region was centered around Podana (modern Bodhan), which was probably Vinayaditya's capital. The Vemulavada inscription states that Vinayaditya had his elephants bathed in a reservoir filled with oil, at Podana. Pampa's "Vikramarjuna Vijayam" similarly states that he had 500 elephants bathed in several "dirghikas" (ponds) filled with oil.
Purported conquests.
The Kollipara copper-plate inscription attributed to Vinayaditya's son Arikesari I portrays him as a great conqueror, but this inscription is of doubtful authenticity. It states that Vinayaditya subjugated several kingdoms including Turushka, Yavana, Kashmira, Kambhoja, Magadha, Malava, Kalinga, Ganga, Pallava, Pandya, and Kerala. These claims of conquests are grossly exaggerated, and other records of the dynasty ignore these supposed conquests. It is possible that Vinayaditya participated in the military campaigns of his overlord Dantidurga, whose inscription credits the Rashtrakuta king with defeating the kings of Kalinga, Malava, and other kingdoms.
Successors.
Vinayaditya had two sons, Arikesari I and Biragriha; Arikesari succeeded him on the throne.

Nighthawk (novel)

Nighthawk is the fourteenth novel in the NUMA Files series by Clive Cussler.
Plot.
This novel centers around NUMA (National Underwater Marine Agency) crew leaders Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. Nighthawk is an advanced unmanned aircraft that has been in space three years collecting data. On its return to earth it defies its controllers who are guiding it to a safe landing and it presumably crashes into the ocean. NUMA is requested by the National Security Agency (NSA) to help find and recover Nighthawk. The NSA sends one of its agents to assist and she, Austin and Zavala attempt to find Nighthawk.
The Russians and the Chinese also seek to find and recover the craft, as well. This adventure takes Austin, Zavala and others from NUMA off the coast of Ecuador and in the mountains of Peru. As Austin and Zavala search for Nighthawk, more of the story of the importance of what is inside this craft comes to light and why the stakes are so high that it be found quickly. They are to find the future of the world depends on their success. Austin meets a man named Urco, who is trying to study the Chachapoya people. He later, once NUMA uncovers the Nighthawk, was a spy nicknamed "The Falconer" who wanted to "turn the world back to the stone age". He is foiled, but it explodes partially over the Pacific ocean which causes plenty of things to break. After this, both a couple Russians who were helping to steal the Nighthawk and the NUMA crew are found on a Caribbean island, now friends.
Reviews.
Kirkus seemed to like this book, although its review alluded to some of the unlikely scenarios in its pages, saying, "Cussler and company deliver another fun page-turner with a plot ranging from the highly improbable to the totally implausible." The Real Book Spy website liked this book, saying, "A huge jump up from last year’s "The Pharoah’s Secret", "Nighthawk" is an exciting thriller that seems slightly more realistic and timely after multiple news headlines about disappearing aircraft."

Rainbow Vent Field

The Rainbow hydrothermal vent field is a system of ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vents located at 36°14'N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). It was discovered in 1994 from temperature readings of ten high-temperature black smokers at a depth of approximately , where fluids can exceed . The site is shallower and larger in area than many other vent fields along the Azores section of the MAR with an area of . Located southeast of Faial Island, it is a popular geochemical sampling and modeling site due to close proximity to the Azores and definitive representation of serpentinization from hydrothermal circulation and synthesis.
Vent geology, biology, and fluid content make Rainbow comparable to other hot hydrothermal vents of the Azores such as Lucky Strike and Menez Gwen. However; chlorinity, metal concentration, and pH distinguish it from neighboring vent fields. As a hot, ultramafic-hosted vent field, pH levels of fluids are extremely low with much H2 and CH4 generated from water interactions with mafic igneous rocks.
Though not actively considered for development, Rainbow lies within the MoMAR (Monitoring of the Mid Atlantic Ridge) survey area for a marine observatory.
Discovery and expeditions.
Rainbow has had a number of visits since its initial discovery in 1994. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), submersibles, and Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) probes have been deployed to sample, characterize, and explore the vent field.
Geologic setting.
Rainbow is located on a massif at depth, shared with two fossil (mostly inactive) vent sites Ghost City and Clamstone. As a slow-spreading ridge at approximately 2.2 cm/yr, extensive faulting has uplifted gabbro and peridotite and exposed ultramafic rock to cold seawater. Faulting may also be responsible for magnitude 3 - 3.5 earthquakes observed in hydroacoustic data, suggesting that the region is tectonically active. Unlike high-temperature basalt systems, this ultramafic setting is associated with a positive magnetic anomaly; postulated to come from magnetite precipitation. The active Rainbow site exhibits numerous active and inactive chimneys at serpentinized peridotite outcrops, distinguishable from sediment cover either by protruding from sediment or at a scarp. Chloride concentrations from vent fluids suggest a common heat source for the site, though the location and geometry of heat sources is unknown.
Hydrothermal circulation.
Due to the extensive faulting at the Rainbow massif, cold ocean seawater is able to permeate deep into the seafloor. Water circulates down a fault line, actively reacting with various sediment and rock layers until it is warmed by an underlying heat source. When warmed, it can undergo a phase transition - often resulting in dramatic changes to fluid chemistry. Super-heated vent fluids then rise and are ejected from the seafloor, where a dramatic drop in temperature from cold-water mixing can cause some fluid chemicals to precipitate out and form chimneys.
With relatively little basalt within a kilometer of the vent field, most reactions influencing the vent fluids during hydrothermal circulation come from differing degrees of serpentinization and veining of peridotites. Olivine-rich rocks such as troctolites undergo significant alteration, being partially replaced by serpentine and magnetite. There is evidence of high-temperature serpentinite alteration on some samples with pre-existing serpentinite, demonstrating overprinting of serpentinites with higher iron content. Mylonic peridotites at the vent field show plastic deformation then overprinted by serpentine and chlorite.
Rainbow exhibits very acidic vent fluids (pH ~2.8) from hydronium ions released from numerous ultramafic rock interactions during vent circulation. Fluids also contain a number of organic carbon molecules, from alkanes and phenol to complicated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) and biogenic fatty acids. These organic carbon molecules suggest organisms living within the vents, harnessing chemosynthetic reactions to metabolize. Serpentinization reactions occur with hydrothermal circulation causing water to react with hot iron-containing minerals, releasing H2 gas and transforming the base rock. Serpentinization may also be responsible for a significant amount of methane produced at Rainbow.
Vent fluids are known to travel many kilometers northeast from their associated vents, depositing any unreacted elements to the seafloor far away from their source.
Phase separation.
Phase separation can occur when seawater is heated to a high enough temperature it will form a second phase. At pressure below the critical point (298 bar, 407 °C for seawater), the seawater boils and produces a vapor phase. At pressure above the critical pressure a saline brine forms as the second phase. In the subsurface, gravitational forces can lead the two phases to separate.
Waters circulating deep within Rainbow rise to a high enough pressure or temperature so that they react with the rock and chemical constituents are dissolved into or precipitate out of the vent fluid. Chemical concentrations in the fluid are further modified when it undergoes phase separation because volatile constituents are concentrated in the vapor rich phase and metal ions in the brine. Phase separation carries great significance for chlorine, an abundant element in seawater with few reactions outside of phase separation, and is often normalized to assess thermodynamics within a ridge system. Depending on the chemical stability of the elements, water entering the seafloor will therefore exhibit different chemical characteristics when it comes back out.
At Rainbow, phase separation is a suggested cause for particularly high concentrations of chloride, trace elements, and hydronium, as they differ greatly from similar MAR vents like Logatchev. Furthermore, Rainbow vent fluids have the highest concentrations of many elements found at the Azores vents, such as hydrogen, transition metals, and rare earth elements (REE). Due to the extreme endmember pH, chloride is hypothesized to act as a dominant cation and therefore forms many weak complexes with other elements at high temperatures. These complexes become unstable when pH rises or temperature decreases, therefore releasing many transition metals and REEs.
Observed endmember fluid samples taken at different vent sites are of very similar manganese and magnesium concentrations, which suggests a common heat source for the vents. There may, however, be many heat sources at Rainbow considering the complex faulting tectonics, and extensive amounts of gabbro and peridotite.
Vent Field biology.
Rainbow has been a long-lived environment for microbial life, with a great diversity of archaea and bacteria at the vent field. Microbes are known to utilize energy from H2 gas and H2S oxidation, with some chemotrophs belonging to the Asgard archaea tree. The Asgard archaea are a very recent discovery with a theorized ancestry in evolution between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Some of the biogenic alkanes found within vent fluids are suggestive of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria or archaea. However, there is also abundant evidence of abiotic production of organic and inorganic molecules at Rainbow, such as methane and carbonate, which may have been supportive of early life. Due to the hot temperatures, low pH, and longevity of the vent activity, there is a strong case for life to originate at sites similar to the Rainbow Massif.
Regarding macrofauna, the Rainbow Massif has been supportive of many kinds of decapods and mollusks, such as Alvinocarididae and Bathymodiolus respectively, feeding where nutrient-rich vent fluids interact with the cold bathypelagic waters. Rainbow exhibits fossils of many kinds of vesicomyid and thyasirid shells. Fossils have been dated at other sites on the Rainbow massif, with Ghost City containing gastropod and clam remains that are aged at nearly 111,000 years old. Shell-rich carbonates have been found at Clamstone, which may be as old as 25,000 years.
Human uses and preservation.
Rainbow, as with all other deepwater vent systems, is a location of highly-specialized biology and sensitive geological structures. Due to its significance as an accessible and examplar ultramafic system, Rainbow is a very popular site for scientific expeditions involving intrusive long-term monitoring, environmental manipulation, and geological sampling. It is also the only vent field on the MAR which has been visited by tourists. Due to some veining processes, ore extraction and mining are another activity than may upset ecosystems of the massif.
Rainbow has a tricky history regarding preservation, as the site is within the OSPAR Maritime Area and just outside of Portugal's exclusive economic zone similarly to another vent field, Saldanha. Portugal was unable to distinguish Rainbow as residing off of the extended Azores shelf region - therefore rendering it unqualified for OSPAR protection as a High Seas location. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lobbied for Rainbow's protection in 2005 and as of 2006, Rainbow is listed by OSPAR as protected marine nature preserve with an MPA size of 22.15 km2.

All In (Homeland)

"All In" is the eleventh episode of the seventh season of the American television drama series "Homeland", and the 83rd episode overall. It premiered on Showtime on April 22, 2018.
Plot.
Senator Paley (Dylan Baker) visits Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) in prison, asking for help in discerning what Saul is doing in Russia. Dar looks at the flight manifest and quickly recognizes that Saul and Carrie are organizing a covert operation. Dar then gives him advice on how to track down Saul's task force stateside, which leads them to Clint (Peter Vack). Janet (Ellen Adair), the Chief of Staff to Senator Paley, threatens Clint with legal action. Clint confesses that Saul and Carrie are in Russia to exfiltrate Simone (Sandrine Holt), who is indeed alive. Janet urges Paley to relay this information to the Russian ambassador (Elya Baskin) to sabotage the mission, thereby ending Keane's hopes to salvage her administration. Paley, visibly conflicted, does nothing while Janet is seen talking to the ambassador herself.
Saul (Mandy Patinkin) and Carrie (Claire Danes) sit down for a diplomatic meeting with representatives from the SVR (state intelligence agency) and the GRU (military intelligence agency). Saul insists on the presence of Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin) before proceeding — a pretense to lure Gromov away from Simone. When Gromov shows up at the meeting, a team led by Anson (James D'Arcy) storms the safehouse where Simone is being kept, but are forced to retreat after being ambushed by guards.
Saul declares the mission a failure, but Carrie is determined to devise a new plan before leaving. She observes dissension between the SVR's General Yakushin and the GRU's Colonel Mirov during the meeting, and wonders how her team can exploit the tense relationship. Sandy (Catherine Curtin) discovers that General Yakushin (Misha Kuznetsov) of the SVR is hiding $300M in various U.S. banking institutions.
President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) gets the news that the Supreme Court has rejected the dismissal of four of her Cabinet secretaries. With that, the Cabinet has the sufficient votes to invoke the 25th Amendment. Vice President Warner (Beau Bridges) arrives at the Oval Office to personally relieve a stunned Keane of her command.
General Yakushin meets with Saul, livid that his bank accounts have been emptied of funds. Saul tells Yakushin that he will return the money in exchange for Simone Martin. When approached by Yakushin, Mirov (Merab Ninidze) falsely denies any knowledge of Simone or her whereabouts. Yakushin responds by sending 30 heavily armed, masked men to GRU headquarters where Simone is being held in an upstairs suite. Chaos and violence ensues as the SVR starts forcefully clearing out the building en masse; Carrie and Anson gain entry clothed like the masked men from the SVR.
Carrie accesses the balcony of Simone's suite via a ledge from a nearby window. Simone holds Carrie at gunpoint but Carrie convinces Simone to come with her, making her understand she is now a massive liability to the Russians who will consider her expendable. Yevgeny sees "Simone" taken away by Anson and orders the car to be followed, but is actually duped by Carrie wearing Simone's scarf and a black wig. The real Simone, wearing a blonde wig, safely escapes in another car with Bennet (Ari Fliakos).

Dawn of a New Day (O'Donel Levy album)

Dawn of a New Day is an album by American jazz guitarist O'Donel Levy recorded in 1971 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Jason Ankeny said: ""Dawn of a New Day" expands the Baroque funk horizons introduced on the brilliant "Breeding of Mind", O'Donel Levy's previous collaboration with arranger Manny Albam. A bigger, bolder effort, "Dawn" 's panoramic sound also borrows much from blaxploitation cinema. ... Levy's remarkable leads seem to cut and paste elements from across the history of jazz guitar, most closely recalling the lean, mean genius of Wes Montgomery and Grant Green. His solos are graceful yet muscular, each note crackling with energy. The material here is also excellent".

RU-16117

RU-16117 is an estrogen medication which was investigated for the potential treatment of symptoms of estrogen deficiency such as hot flashes and osteoporosis in women but was never marketed. It was developed for use by mouth.
Pharmacology.
Pharmacodynamics.
RU-16117 is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). In mouse uterine tissue, it shows about 5 to 13% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER and about 1% of the estrogenic activity of estradiol. Conversely, it shows no affinity for the androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors, nor any activities associated with interactions with these receptors. While the association rate of RU-16117 to the ER is the same as that of moxestrol, it dissociates from the ER extremely rapidly at rates of about three times faster than estradiol and about 20 times faster than moxestrol. This is similar to the case of estriol, which RU-16117 is described as sharing similarities with. RU-16117 is described as a weak or partial estrogen or a mixed estrogen/antiestrogen. It has been described as having highly active antiestrogenic activity with very weak uterotrophic activity. However, higher doses and/or prolonged administration of RU-16117 have been reported to induce equivalent estrogenic responses relative to estradiol and moxestrol.
Chemistry.
RU-16117, also known as 11α-methoxy-17α-ethynylestradiol (11α-MeO-EE) or as 11α-methoxy-17α-ethynylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol) with a methoxy group at the C11α position. The compound is the C11α isomer or C11 epimer of moxestrol (11β-methoxy-17α-ethynylestradiol).

Stefana Miladinović

Stefana Miladinović (; born 28 September 1981) is a politician in Serbia. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia from 2012 until August 2020 as a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia.
Early life and career.
Miladinović was born in Belgrade, then part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and still resides in the city's Rakovica municipality. She has a bachelor's degree in politicology with a focus on diplomacy and security. Miladinović has served as head of the marketing service of Serbia's Agency of Traffic Safety and was a member of the executive committee and the main committee of the Socialist Party.
Political career.
Miladinović received the 150th position on the Socialist Party's electoral list for the 2007 parliamentary election and the 149th position in the 2008 assembly election. The party list won sixteen and twenty mandates, respectively, on these occasions. Miladinović could have been selected for the party's assembly delegation on either occasion notwithstanding her relatively low positions on the lists, although in the event she was not. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order.)
Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Miladinović received the twenty-fifth position on the party's list in the 2012 parliamentary election and was elected when the list won forty-four mandates. She was promoted to the fifteenth position for both the 2014 and 2016 elections and was re-elected on both occasions. The Socialist Party has served in a coalition government with the Progressive Party since 2012, and Miladinović has been a part of its parliamentary majority throughout this time.
Miladinović was the deputy chair of the parliamentary committee on spatial planning, transport, infrastructure, and telecommunications; a deputy member of three other committees; the head of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; was a deputy member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, where she served with the Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group; the head of Serbia's parliamentary friendship group with Morocco; and was a member of its parliamentary friendship groups with Belarus, Canada, China, Cuba, Cyprus, Greece, the Holy See, Italy, Kazakhstan, Norway, the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America. She was previously the chair of the parliamentary friendship group with Belarus and in this capacity met with Mikhail Myasnikovich, then chair of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of Belarus, in July 2017.

Peppermint (2018 film)

Peppermint is a 2018 American vigilante action thriller film directed by Pierre Morel and starring Jennifer Garner. Also featuring John Ortiz, John Gallagher Jr., Juan Pablo Raba, and Tyson Ritter, the plot follows a mother who transforms herself into a vigilante in a quest for revenge against the drug cartel that killed her husband. The film was released in the United States on September 7, 2018. It grossed over $53 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics, although Garner's performance was praised. The film was released on Netflix in 2020 and has become one of the most watched films on the platform.
Plot.
Riley North is a banker in Los Angeles, struggling financially alongside her husband Chris, the owner of a failing mechanic shop. They have a ten-year-old daughter, Carly. Chris is offered the chance by one of his friends to take part in a robbery targeting Diego Garcia, head of a powerful drug-trafficking syndicate. Chris turns him down, but Garcia thinks he was part of the plan, and after brutally murdering Chris's friend he sends out three of his men to kill Chris as well. Riley and Chris take Carly to a carnival for her birthday after an awful suburban mother named Peg makes sure that no one goes to Carly's planned party. As the family walks to their car, Garcia's triggermen gun them down in a drive-by shooting. Carly and Chris are killed, and Riley is badly wounded.
Despite her injuries, Riley positively identifies the shooters. A senior LAPD detective, Beltran, warns his younger partner Carmichael that cops who interfere in Garcia's business end up dead. Prior to the preliminary hearing, Riley is visited by Henderson, a cartel lawyer. When Riley refuses to take his bribe, he uses her anti-psychotic medication to portray her as unreliable in court. Judge Stevens dismisses the case, and the prosecutor, Goldman, does nothing in response. Outraged, Riley is subdued while attacking her family's killers in court, and is committed to a psychiatric ward. Before her ambulance can leave, she fights her way out and escapes.
Five years later, Beltran and Carmichael arrive at the carnival to find the three men who killed Riley's family hanging from a Ferris wheel (in the film's opening sequence, Riley had beaten one of them until he was bloody and then shot him in the head). The killings attract the attention of FBI Agent Lisa Inman, who informs the detectives that Riley robbed her bank and used the money to travel abroad. Living on a string of false identities, she has been traveling throughout Europe and Asia, studying combat and military tactics. Video footage reveals that she was recently involving in a theft of multiple "military-grade" firearms from a gun shop. 
Meanwhile, Riley drowns Goldman in his pool, burns Henderson alive in his house, and kills the now-retired Stevens in an explosion. Inman, Carmichael, and Beltran inform the media about Riley, triggering a debate between those who see her as a vigilante hero or a criminal. Elsewhere, Garcia comes under pressure from his cartel partners after Riley destroys two of his drug shipments in a week, as they warn him that he is their puppet and they can cut him loose if he doesn't handle his business.
Riley guns down a gang laundering money for the cartel and burns their shop down; Garcia vows to kill her. Tracking recent crime patterns, Inman discovers that Riley has been living on Skid Row. She finds Riley's van full of stolen weapons and learns that the people there see Riley as their guardian angel.
Garcia sets a trap for Riley by rigging his warehouse with explosives. She survives, then humiliates him by breaking into his mansion and killing Salazar and Garcia's bodyguards. Before she can shoot Garcia, his young daughter interrupts them. When Riley hesitates, Garcia wounds her and escapes. Riley shows up to Peg's house and punches her out. After restraining and mocking Peg for her failed marriage, Riley steals her SUV. 
Inman asks Carmichael to meet her at Skid Row. She hopes to convince Riley to help them take down Garcia, but Carmichael kills Inman and tips off Garcia that Riley is on her way there.
At Skid Row, Riley confronts and kills Garcia's lieutenant, Cortez, and his gunmen. She uses Inman's phone to contact the media and exposes Carmichael's corruption. When the police arrive, Garcia kills Carmichael, assuming he ratted him out to the police. Garcia flees, but Riley catches him, beats him up, and is about to shoot him. Beltran arrives and asks Riley to stand down and assures her that Garcia will surely rot in prison this time with no hope of bribing himself out. But Riley is unconvinced, remembering how the system failed and turned on her the last time she put faith in it, with no chances of escaping and foolishly underestimating Riley's thirst for revenge. Garcia taunts her that she would spend more time in prison than him when they are arrested. This is a costly error in judgement however, as Riley states neither of them are going to prison before killing him with a head shot. As the police shoot at her, Beltran orders them to cease fire, and Riley once again escapes.
Beltran finds Riley critically wounded at her husbands gravestone. He takes her to the hospital despite her desire to die. On the news, the police chief states that Riley North will be made to answer for her crimes. Beltran later visits Riley while she is in police custody at a hospital, telling her that there are many, including the police, who agree with her actions and covertly passes her a key to her handcuffs to enable her escape.

The film made $4.7million on its first day, including $800,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $13.4million, finishing second at the box office, behind "The Nun".
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 142 reviews, and an average rating of 3.49/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Far from refreshing, "Peppermint" wastes strong work from Jennifer Garner on a dreary vigilante-revenge story that lacks unique twists or visceral thrills." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.
Frank Scheck of "The Hollywood Reporter" called the film ""Death Wish" on steroids", and said it "lacks subtlety and anything even remotely resembling credibility, but, like its heroine, it certainly gets the job done". IndieWire's Jude Dry gave the film a "C+". He wrote that Garner deserves to be in better films, and said the film is a "rare return to form for Garner, who doles out her vigilante justice with effortless charm. Unfortunately, that's about the only reason to see "Peppermint"". 
Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film two out of four stars, writing, "In the stylishly directed but gratuitously nasty and cliché-riddled "Peppermint", Garner plays essentially two characters cut from the same person." Writing for "TheWrap", Todd Gilchrist said that "Peppermint" "ultimately possesses the stale predictability of an unwrapped candy discovered at the bottom of a purse."
Andrew Barker of "Variety" wrote: "Garner gives everything that is asked of her, from brute physicality to dewy-eyed tenderness, but this half-witted calamity botches just about everything else. Drably by-the-numbers except for the moments where it goes gobsmackingly off-the-rails, "Peppermint" misfires from start to finish."
Emily Yoshida of "New York Magazine" wrote: "There was a time when a woman being the star of her own bad action franchise could have been considered the apex of progress, but that time is past." Yoshida criticizes the lack of originality in the film and says that casting Garner is not enough to change that.

At Dominion Marty Scurll, Hangman Page, and Cody defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi, Jushin Thunder Liger, and Rey Mysterio Jr.. A match between Tanahashi and KUSHIDA against Scurll and Page at G1 Special was also officially announced on June 21.
On June 9 at Dominion Minoru Suzuki and Zack Sabre Jr. defeated Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano. Suzuki and Ishii brawled after the match. This led to three matches being made for Strong Style Evolved UK. On Night 1, Suzuki and Sabre would defend the RPW Undisputed British Tag Team Championship against Ishii and Kazuchika Okada, while on Night 2 Okada faced Sabre and Ishii defended the RPW British Heavyweight Championship against Suzuki. On June 21, a rematch pitting Suzuki and Sabre against Ishii and Yano was announced for G1 Special.
Aftermath.
During the match for the Junior Heavyweight Title, Takahashi received a Dragon Driver from Dragon Lee and landed on his neck. Backstage, after winning the match, Takahashi fainted and was sent to a hospital. It was later revealed that Takahashi had broken his neck.

Taipei Red Lions F.C.

Taipei Red Lions F.C. were a professional football club from Taipei, last participating in Taiwan Football Premier League.
 Red Lions has won two Taiwan Football Premier League promotion tournaments, six Taipei International Football Leagues, one Businessmen Football League, one Taipei Super Cup and several local and international short tournaments.
Taipei Red Lions football team was founded in 1983 as the amateur team from Tianmu, Shilin District.
In 1989 Red Lions were one of the founding members of the Businessmen Football League, the top amateur league in Taiwan for many years.
In 2005 Red Lions were one of the founding members of Taipei International Football League, a highly inclusive tournament suitable for players of all ages and nationalities that has become the strongest annual amateur league in Taiwan.
In 2017 Red Lions signed a cooperation agreement with Taicheng Football Academy to train world-class football players and teams in the most systematic and creative way to ensure that the team has the highest level of football.
The outstanding performance of Taipei Red Lions in the amateur league and the cooperation agreement signed with Taicheng Football Academy motivated the team to participate in Taiwan First Division Qualifiers in 2017, winning the tournament and the right to join CTFA top level league in 2018.
In 2018 Red Lions signed a cooperation agreement with University of Taipei to foster the best young talents in Taiwan as international-level professional football players and create real benefits for future generations.
History.
Under their new name of Taicheng Lions the club qualified for the 2018 TFPL Qualification Tournament. A 3–2 victory over Ming Chuan University was followed by a 1–1 draw and penalty shootout defeat to Tainan City, meaning that they had to defeat fellow newcomers Bear Bro Ilan to assure themselves of qualification. A resounding 17–0 victory gained them the first position in the qualifiers and ensured that Taicheng Lions would compete in the Taiwan Football Premier League in 2018.
The success of the project quickly catches the attention of the football community and many of the staff and players from Taicheng Lions were recruited for teams in China, Spain or around Taiwan. The team had to rebuilt the project in 2019 with new youth talent. In 2019 Red Lions and Taicheng merged and the club decided to use the same Red Lions name for all its teams. Once again at the end of 2019 season many players were transferred to teams in Chile, Cambodia and Taiwan, making the them one of the most prominent players' developer in the island.
Symbols.
Red colour.
It represented the passion of the team for football and its fans, just like the Taipei City flag symbolized caring for society.
Crest.
Red Lions crest was a red circular affair with the eponymous red lion taking central part. Inside the circle was the name of the team in Chinese (台北紅獅足球俱樂部), and the year the team was founded (1983). The lion symbolized courage, majesty, and the strength of the club. 
Mascot.
The name of the mascot was Dahong (大鴻), "big red" in Chinese, a red dancing lion that represents good luck and fortune, also the team work necessary in football.

Bob McNeely

Robert McNeely (born 1947) is an American photographer, best known for being the Chief Official White House Photographer from 1993 to 1998, during the presidency of Bill Clinton.
Life and career.
Early career.
McNeely was drafted into the Army in November 1967 when he was 21, and served in combat in the Vietnam War. He was there for fourteen months and was part of the 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, where he attained the rank of sergeant, and earned a Bronze Star Medal. While there, he bought an inexpensive Nikon camera, started taking pictures and ended up running the Army photo lab. When he returned to the United States, he enrolled in a summer workshop at Aspen, Colorado, under the tutelage of professional photographers Nathan Lyons, Bruce Davidson, Cornell Capa and Paul Caponigro. This would be the only formal training he would receive, as he moved to California to follow the campaign trail of George McGovern, impressed with McGovern's opposition to the ongoing war in Vietnam. It was also around this time that he struck up a friendship with Hunter S. Thompson.
Political photojournalism.
Following McGovern's defeat to Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, McNeely pursued his career in photojournalism, with a further high point coming in 1973, as his photographs of the Nixon impeachment case were published in "Time". McNeely was then appointed official campaign photographer for vice presidential nominee Walter Mondale, and after Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as President, McNeely kept his position as Mondale's official photographer. In 1980, when Carter and Mondale lost the election to Reagan and Bush, McNeely stepped away from the world of politics and went into the private sector as a photographer, working freelance for magazines such as "Time" and "Newsweek".
Bill Clinton.
In January 1992, former Carter White House staffers who had been working on the campaign trail of Bill Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas, contacted McNeely if he would be interested in covering it as well. McNeely was reluctant to do so, and suggested they hire a younger photographer, which they did. When Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination, McNeely thought that he had made a mistake in not taking the job. The next day, he was contacted again by the same people to tell him that the situation with the other photographer was not working out, so the job was re-offered to him. He had only an hour to decide, and afterwards, he would be a part of the campaign staff up until Election Day. He returned to the White House the following year, after Clinton's victory in the election.
In November 1995, McNeely's photographs became a source of political leverage in the wake of the first federal government shutdown later that month. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated during the ongoing disagreements over the budget, and a delegation consisting of Clinton, Vice President Gore, Speaker of the House Gingrich and Majority Senate Leader Dole amongst others flew aboard "Air Force One" to the funeral. Gingrich complained that he was not able to discuss the budget and was sent to the back of the plane, so he shut down the government in retaliation. McNeely remembered that he had taken pictures of Clinton and Gingrich together on the flight back to Washington, and showed them to Press Secretary Mike McCurry, who saw the potential in outsmarting Gingrich. McNeely made multiple prints of the perceived incident and left them in the media briefing room in the West Wing, where they were taken by journalists. Once the photographs were published, the press criticized Gingrich for his false claim.
Around the same time, McNeely realized that he had been, unwittingly, a witness to a small part of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. When Clinton met with staff members in a meeting, he gestured to the photographer to take a picture of him and the intern. McNeely did so, and thought nothing of it, but after additional information had become widely known, he surmised that Lewinsky had performed oral sex on the President earlier that day. While McNeely had previously been granted unprecedented access to the White House, he was barred in the fallout of the scandal, as the Clintons were worried that the photographs could be subpoenaed by Ken Starr (although some of which eventually made it into the hands of the independent counsel). He was also excluded from meetings with lawyers in fear that he might testify on what he had heard, and frustrated over the focus of the President's personal life, quit the position in September 1998, citing a desire to be with his family.
Post-White House work.
In October 2000, McNeely published his first photobook, "The Clinton Years", the first time a book was published with the subject still in office, and as such, the White House also had a say in what photographs were used. However, as the book was printed at a press in mainland China, it had been held up when authorities realized that there was a photograph of Clinton meeting with the Dalai Lama. They confiscated the entire press run, threatening to destroy the books unless the offending photograph was removed, but they relented at the last minute and the book was released. In the same year, McNeely was the official campaign photographer for Hillary Clinton's successful senate campaign, and also followed Democratic, Republican and third party presidential nominees around the country, in a project entitled "Politics 2000".

Jayson Keeling

Jayson Keeling (born 1966) is an artist working in photography, video, sculpture, and installation. Keeling's work challenges conventional norms surrounding sex, gender, race, and religion. Keeling often reconfigures popular iconography, to explore notions of masculinity, and cultural ritual.
Early life and education.
Jayson Keeling was born in 1966 in Brooklyn, NY to Jamaican parents. Keeling's grew up between Jamaica and the Bronx, New York. His bi-cultural upbringing would later influence his work. Keeling graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology in 1986 with an AA in Fashion Illustration and Art History. Keeling started off by working as a photographer and film director in fashion, music, film, and the pornography industry.
Art.
Jayson Keeling mines popular culture, and mythology to create artworks that question and deconstruct accepted politics of sex, gender, race, and religion. Keeling works in photography, video, sculpture, and installation.
His work often pulls from different visual cultures and then "jams them all into the same frame." Keeling often works in the realms in-between cultures, creating work that is "neither here nor there." He often uses performative gestures to explore ritual and masculinity.
Jayson Keeling's photographs have been described as violent, sexy, glam and grotesque.
A work by Keeling, a diptych of photographs of legendary dancer and choreographer, Willi Ninja, exhibited at the 2008 "The B Sides" show at Aljira, a Center for Contemporary Art was described by art critic Benjamin Genocchio as "one of the show's most arresting exhibits" in "The New York Times".

Southern Hydrate Ridge

Southern Hydrate Ridge, located about 90 km offshore Oregon Coast, is an active methane seeps site located on the southern portion of Hydrate Ridge. It extends 25 km in length and 15 km across, trending north-northeast-south-southwest at the depth of approximately 800 m. Southern Hydrate Ridge has been the site of numerous submersible dives with the human occupied "Alvin" submarine, extensive visits by numerous robotic vehicles including "the Canadian ROV ROPOS", "Jason (US National Deep Submersible Facility)", and "Tiburon" (MBARI), and time-series geophysical studies that document changes in the subsurface distribution of methane. It is also a key site of the National Science Foundations Regional Cabled Array that is part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), which includes eight types of cabled instruments streaming live data back to shore 24/7/365 at the speed of light, as well as uncabled instruments.
Geological background.
The geologic history of the Southern Hydrate Ridge has been reconstructed through seismic imaging, which provides constraints on the origin of methane ice deposits found in this region. Hydrate Ridge is in a region where faults along the Cascadia Margin transition from seaward-verging to landward-verging. This fault reorientation corresponds to the transition from sedimentary accretion to subduction in this active accretionary margin. Seaward-verging thrust faults characterize the ridge deformation front, extending down to ~7 km beneath the summit. Initiation of the uplift of Southern Hydrate Ridge is predicted to have initiated about 1 million years ago.
Sedimentary characteristics.
Clay-rich sediments have been found at the Southern Hydrate Ridge. These sediments are from Pleistocene to Holocene in age, and composed of 29% smectite, 31% illite, and 40% (chlorite + kaolinite) on average. Underlying the Pleistocene-Holocene strata is the late-Pliocene-early-Pleistocene accretionary material, composed of 38% smectite, 27% illite, and 35% (chlorite + kaolinite). A thick permeable zone of coarse-grained turbidites underlies the sediments.
Located along the Cascadia accretionary margin, sediment build-up in this region is driven by two subduction-related processes:
Continuous duplexing and underplating of sediment has caused thickening of sediments through uplifting. Furthermore, compaction and dewatering in this region has led to increased local pore pressure.
Methane Ice at Southern Hydrate Ridge.
Methane ice at Southern Hydrate Ridge has been found within the shallow sediments, and more rarely exposed on the seafloor. Because Southern Hydrate Ridge is located on the upper continental slope, the regional hydrate stability zone (RHSZ), which is controlled by the sediment pore pressure and temperature, is very shallow. As organic material in the sediments is utilized by microbes, producing methane saturation within the sediment pores, methane ice forms within the RHSZ. The base of the RHSZ marks the transition from methane-ice-rich sediment, to clay sediments. Due to the impedance contrast between RHSZ and the underlying sediments, the depth of RHSZ can be detected using seismic imaging techniques.
Associated microbially-mediated carbonate formations.
Methane hydrate formation is associated with extensive authigenic carbonate. These carbonate deposits are associated with the local chemosynthetic communities such as sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, mussels, vesicomyid clams, snails and tube worms (although tube worms are not observed at Southern Hydrate Ridge). Migration and egress of methane-rich fluids and microbial interactions can lead to the formation of chemoherms through anaerobic oxidation of methane. At Southern Hydrate Ridge, in addition to a gentle rampart of authigenic carbonate cobbles that rims the main seep site, there is a 60-m tall massive carbonate deposit called the Pinnacle. Uranium-thorium dating of carbonate material from the Pinnacle indicates that the Pinnacle is between ~ 7,000 and 11,000 years old.
Methane venting: spatial and temporal discontinuity.
Methane venting includes the release of methane in the form of fluid and gases from methane seeps as methane ice dissociates. Due to the narrow RHSZ at the upper continental slope, methane ice at Southern Hydrate Ridge is metastable such that changes in seafloor temperature and pressure may lead to destabilization of methane ice and the disassociation into fluid and gas.
Methane venting at Southern Hydrate Ridge has been observed to be transient and episodic with temporal variations of hours to days. This area is characterized by multiple sites of venting. which is thought to reflect different fracture networks. While active venting may maintain open fracture networks, fractures may also be filled by hydrates when there is no venting. As venting reactivates, a new fracture system may be created. While temporal and spatial variations in venting have been observed at this seep site, the local venting rate has been found to varyi over six orders of magnitude: the controls are still not well understood. New instrumentation at this site, including cabled multibeam sonar systems developed by the University of Bremen, now image the entire seep area of Southern Hydrate Ridge, scanning for plumes every two hours. An overview sonar and quantification sonar at the main study site "Einsteins Grotto", are providing new insights into the temporal, spatial and intensity of the plumes and quantification of methane flux from this highly dynamic environment.
Significance.
Release of methane from marine seep sites into the atmosphere may have been a factor for past climate warming events, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). It is estimated that there are Gigatons of carbon trapped as methane in margin environments and the release of methane from seeps is thought to be responsible for 5 to 10% of the global atmospheric methane.
Scientific investigation.
Since the discovery of methane seeps and novel microbial and macrofauna at Hydrate Ridge in 1986, the Southern Hydrate Ridge has become an extensive study site. Currently, it is one of the study sites under the OOI Regional Cabled Array. Infrastructure, including a diverse suite of instruments, was installed and became fully operational in 2014. Sensors that are currently at this site include:

<doc id="56962671" url="?curid=56962671" title="Sex-hormonal agent">
Sex-hormonal agent

A sex-hormonal agent, also known as a sex-hormone receptor modulator, is a type of hormonal agent which specifically modulates the effects of sex hormones and of their biological targets, the sex hormone receptors. The sex hormones include androgens such as testosterone, estrogens such as estradiol, and progestogens such as progesterone. Sex-hormonal agents may be either steroidal or nonsteroidal in chemical structure and may serve to either enhance, inhibit, or have mixed effects on the function of the sex hormone systems.
Sex-hormonal agents are used in medicine for a variety of purposes including hormone therapy (e.g., menopausal hormone therapy, androgen replacement therapy, transgender hormone therapy), antihormone therapy (e.g., androgen deprivation therapy, estrogen deprivation therapy), and hormonal contraception, among others.
Types and examples.
Indirect sex-hormonal agents.
Drugs that indirectly influence sex hormone systems, such as antigonadotropins like GnRH analogues and prolactin releasers (e.g., D2 receptor antagonists), progonadotropins like GnRH agonists, and steroidogenesis inhibitors like aromatase inhibitors and androgen synthesis inhibitors, are also sex-hormonal agents.

Trout Point Logging Camp

The Trout Point Logging Camp was in operation from the late 19th century to well into the 20th century. Located on Stockton Island near Bayfield, Wisconsin, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and the State Register of Historic Places early the following year.
Background.
It is an archeological site on the northeast shore of Stockton Island. A 2008 study reported:The Trout Point logging camp site (47AS218) on the northeast shore of Stockton Island has been investigated more thoroughly than other logging camp sites on the island. Archaeological surveys and test excavations in 1982 showed the Trout Point site to be highly intact with undisturbed features and artifacts in their original contexts. This is in contrast to most mainland logging sites, which have been disturbed by collecting and
other activities. The thirty-six features that archaeologists identified at the Trout Point site take the form of a variety of depressions, some of them enclosed by embankments that are the remains of building walls. Buildings that have been identified include a kitchen, dining hall, root cellar, two bunkhouses with space for fifty-six men in each, filer’s shack, and office/store. The buildings were constructed of logs, and nails, window glass, and hardware have been found in association with their remains. Other features include a well, privies, trash pits, and drainage ditches. Many artifacts from the site relate to preparing, serving, eating, and storing food including bottles, jars, table settings, pitchers, and stove fragments. Animal bones show that the loggers ate more beef than pork. Personal items range from buttons to part of a harmonica. Numerous tobacco tins and snuff cans attest to extensive use of these substances. Tools were too expensive to leave behind; the few examples found include a cant hook, saw, and wedge. Artifact dates indicate occupation of the camp between ca. 1912–20, which correlates with the historical record. The planned layout of the camp suggests that most of it was constructed at one time. Archaeological evidence dates this construction to ca. 1912 and indicates that the camp was occupied for several seasons. The Trout Point logging camp has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places for the wealth of information that it holds on an important phase of logging in the Lake Superior region.

<doc id="56962872" url="?curid=56962872" title="Halo (safety device)">
Halo (safety device)

The halo is a driver crash-protection system used in open-wheel racing series, which consists of a curved bar placed to protect the driver's head.
The first tests of the halo were carried out in 2016 and in July 2017. Since the 2018 season the FIA has made the halo mandatory on every vehicle in Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula Regional, Formula E and also Formula 4 as a new safety measure. Some other open-wheel racing series also utilise the halo, such as IndyCar Series, Indy Lights, Super Formula, Super Formula Lights, Euroformula Open and Australian S5000. The IndyCar halo is used as a structural frame for the aeroscreen.
Construction.
The system consists of a bar that surrounds the driver's head and is connected by three points to the vehicle frame. The halo is made of titanium and weighed around in the version presented in 2016, then rose to in 2017.
The system is not developed by the teams, but is manufactured by three approved external manufacturers chosen by the FIA and has the same specification for all vehicles.
In a simulation performed by the FIA, using the data of 40 real incidents, the use of the system led to a 17% theoretical increase in the survival rate of the driver.
History and development.
During development, the FIA examined three fundamental scenarios—collision between two vehicles, contact between a vehicle and the surrounding environment (such as barriers) and collisions with vehicles and debris. Tests have shown that the halo system can significantly reduce the risk of injury to the driver. In many cases the system was able to prevent the helmet from coming into contact with a barrier when checked against a series of accidents that had occurred in the past. During the study of the last case it was found that the halo was able to deflect large objects and provide greater protection against smaller debris.
In August 2017 the Dallara F2 2018, a new Formula 2 car, was presented and was the first to install the halo system. The SRT05e Formula E car presented in January 2018 had a halo. In November 2018, the 2019 FIA Formula 3 car, which was unveiled in Abu Dhabi, installed the halo too. Beginning in 2021, the Indy Lights' IL-15 began using the halo.
Alternative systems.
As an alternative to the halo system, Red Bull Advanced Technologies developed the transparent "aeroscreen". The design, which was similar to a small fairing, did not receive much interest from the FIA. After the drivers had expressed their opposition to the introduction of the halo system, the FIA developed "Shield", a transparent polyvinyl chloride screen. In 2019 the aeroscreen was adapted to use the halo as a structural frame for use in IndyCar.
Sebastian Vettel was the first and only driver to try Shield in a Formula 1 car. During the free practice for the 2017 British Grand Prix, he completed a lap with the new system before ending the test early. He complained of distorted and blurred vision that prevented him from driving. Its introduction was subsequently excluded, as there was no guarantee that the issues with Shield could be solved in time for the 2018 season.
Initial reception.
The system aroused some criticism before it was involved in any incidents, including that of Niki Lauda, who claimed that the system distorted the "essence of racing cars". The system was also initially unpopular with fans, with some saying that it was visually unappealing, against the concept of open-cockpit racing, and obstructed the driver's vision. Other former drivers, including Jackie Stewart, welcomed the system and compared it to the introduction of seat belts, which had been similarly criticised, but then became the norm also on road cars. Max Verstappen made a scathing assessment of the halo in 2018, saying that it "abused the DNA" of F1, which was "less dangerous than riding a bicycle in a city." 
Incidents.
Despite initial criticism, the halo was praised by the community following an incident where the halo was struck by another car—one in the Formula 2 race at Spain, where Tadasuke Makino's halo was landed on by fellow Japanese driver Nirei Fukuzumi's car, and one in the Belgian Grand Prix, where Charles Leclerc's halo was struck by Fernando Alonso's airborne McLaren, with both of their haloes showing visible damage from the impact. Both Makino and Leclerc credited the halo for possibly saving their lives, and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, who had criticised the halo earlier in the season, said that saving Leclerc from injury made the halo "worth it" despite its "terrible aesthetics".
The halo was credited with saving the life of Alex Peroni after his vehicle became airborne and crashed during a Formula 3 event at Monza on 7 September 2019. It also played a critical role in protecting Romain Grosjean at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix where, after hitting Daniil Kvyat's car, he crashed into the barriers head-on. The car split the crash barrier, allowing the car to slip through in between and splitting off the back of the car from the safety cell. The halo deflected the upper section of the barrier, protecting Grosjean's head from the impact. Despite initial concern over drivers being unable to evacuate quickly due to the halo, Grosjean was able to climb out largely unassisted, despite the car catching fire upon impact with the barrier. He emerged from the flames with burns on his hands and ankles. "I wasn't for the halo some years ago, but I think it's the greatest thing that we've brought to Formula 1, and without it I wouldn't be able to speak with you today," Grosjean said. In a similar pre-halo accident at the 1974 United States Grand Prix, driver Helmuth Koinigg was decapitated. At the 2021 Italian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton collided. Verstappen's wheel landed on the halo protecting Hamilton's head, with Hamilton later saying it "saved my neck".

We Will (song)

"We Will" is a song by British-Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan, released as a single in July 1971. The ballad was O'Sullivan's second top 20 hit, peaking at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart on 4 September 1971. It was included as a bonus track on the 2011 reissue of his debut album "Himself".
O'Sullivan has described it as "very much a Catholic working class family song". Upon release, Peter Jones of "Record Mirror" considered the song "less infectious" than O'Sullivan's first hit "Nothing Rhymed", but described it as "unmistakeably Gilbert, with that mixture of naivety and power."&lt;ref name="https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Record-Mirror/70s/71/Record-Mirror-1971-07-10-S-OCR.pdf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in "The Guardian", Bob Stanley considered "We Will" to be "a song of resigned melancholy about how to get through a personal crisis by appreciating things such as kicking a ball, visiting distant relatives, eating corn flakes." "The Times" writer Pavel Barter wrote in 2017 that the song "introduced a form of kitchen-sink observational drama usually lacking in pop music."
O'Sullivan re-recorded "We Will" for his 1987 album "Frobisher Drive". The song was covered by Rumer on her 2012 album "Boys Don’t Cry". O'Sullivan has recounted in interviews being phoned up by Andy Williams in the 1970s, who was planning to cover the song and wanted permission to change the line 'I bagsy being in goal' as he didn't understand the expression.

Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff

Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff is a 2018 American satirical novel written by Sean Penn. Narrated from the point of view of Pappy Pariah, the book tells the story of Bob Honey, a supposed international assassin who kills elderly people with a mallet. Atria Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, published the novel on March 27, 2018.
Inspiration.
In several interviews, Penn said that he was inspired to write the novel in response to current political movements, including the Parkland shooting survivors working to change gun laws. Although readers can draw connections to modern events and figures, Penn claims that the book is about morality and modern American culture.
Plot.
With no formal plot, it is not entirely clear if Honey's life story, recounted through Pariah, is supposed to be true or a figment of Honey's delusional mind. Honey lives in a quiet street in Woodview, California. Since his divorce, he has a hard time connecting with other people and annoys his neighbors with his lawn mowing. Honey complains of the incessant marketing of modern society and never-ending news cycles. His ex-wife, who drives an ice-cream truck around his neighborhood, is now happily married to her divorce lawyer. Honey now longs for a young woman named Annie; when describing her, he says, "Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare."
Honey is a former septic tank salesman who becomes an assassin. He tries to be more social, throwing a barbecue for his neighbors. His job as a contract killer for a secretive government program takes him around the world. The off-the-books government program instructs him to target elderly citizens and others who drain resources in a consumption-driven society. His adventures include a trip to New Orleans to help Katrina victims. He travels to Baghdad, Beirut, South Sudan, and other locations for sewage emergencies. Honey also submerges himself into the Pacific Ocean in a quest to find sea life. An investigative journalist starts asking questions about him, causing Honey to start making changes in his life. He is threatened by an ever-invasive media and possible assassination attempts from his mysterious controllers.
The book includes an epilogue featuring a poem that touches on current events — the Las Vegas mass shooting, North Korea, Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and the #MeToo movement. Honey also writes a threatening letter to the US President "Mr. Landlord" in which he advocates for the President's assassination. He declares, "You are not simply a president in need of impeachment, you are a man in need of an intervention. We are not simply a people in need of an intervention, we are a nation in need of an assassin [...] Tweet me bitch, I dare you." The lengthy epilogue poem ends with Honey killing the investigative journalist with his mallet and running away to parts unknown.
Release.
A portion of the novel was first published as a free Audible book, listing Pappy Pariah as the author and Penn as just the narrator of the audio book. Initially, Penn denied being the author of the book, insisting instead that it was written by an author he had met in a bar in Key West, Florida.
In press junkets to promote the novel's release, Penn has stated his wish to quit acting and become a full-time novelist.
Reception.
"Bob Honey" was met with generally negative reviews, with several critics decrying the writer's undisciplined style. Mark Athitakis writing for "The Washington Post" was critical of the book, observing that the satire was not humorous and the writing incoherent with overuse of alliteration. Writing for the "National Review", Jonah Goldberg had not yet read the book but commented on excerpts, characterizing the formulaic prose as "4 parts alliteration, 1 part wry masturbation references." Goldberg's comments were based on a review and quotes provided by Claire Fallon of the "Huffington Post", who herself was highly critical of the book, going so far as to announce that "Sean Penn The Novelist Must Be Stopped". It was featured in Michael J. Nelson and Conor Lastowka's podcast series "372 Pages We'll Never Get Back", a program which analyzes literature they deem to be of poor quality. On Cracked.com, Mark Hill called it "the worst novel in human history," observing that "Penn writes like he's looked up every single word in his thesaurus except 'dictionary'." The novel was also criticized for racist and misogynistic content. In "The Guardian", Sian Cain called "Bob Honey" "repellent and stupid on so many levels."
Penn has defended portions of the book concerning the presidency of Donald Trump and the Me Too movement as being "taken out of context", remarking, "I think, we're in a sad state where fiction is attributed to opinion ... where fiction can't be just read as it "is"." Several media sources have interpreted "Mr. Landlord" as an obvious allegorical reference to Donald Trump. According to the BBC News, "Critics were keen to pick up on Mr Landlord, a character that could be a thinly veiled dig at Donald Trump. He is described as a 'violently immature 70-year-old boy-man with money and French vanilla cotton candy hair'."
Novelist Salman Rushdie praised the novel, saying "It seems wrong to say that so dystopian a novel is great fun to read [...] I suspect that Thomas Pynchon and Hunter S. Thompson would love this book." Travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux also came out in favor of the book, calling it "Comic, cauchemaresque, crackling with life [...] Bob Honey is a hero of our Trumpian times reflected in the cracked mirror of Penn's prose. I loved that it defied the critics who are, as always like eunuchs in a harem observing the creative act but unable to do the same."
Trevor Noah, on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show", described the book as "a strange story that seems like a metaphor for real life." Penn told Marc Maron in his podcast, "WTF", that the novel "Bob Honey" was a way for him to combat the negativity and societal burnout he had been dealing with. "It was an exercise in avoiding defeat," he told Maron. "It's kind of 'operating world humor,' because I felt like a surgeon whose patient was inevitably going to die every day. And I thought, let me go practice this in an alternate reality form which got me away from the news for a while."
Sequel.
A sequel was released on September 10, 2019, with the title "Bob Honey Sings Jimmy Crack Corn", published by Rare Bird Books, as it directly continues off the events of the first novel, seeing Bob Honey, hunted by the authorities, head to Washington, D.C. to directly confront the Landlord.

Buddha For You

Buddha For You is an antique Buddhist statuary store and gift shop in San Diego, California. The store offers a collection of existing and custom Buddhist statuary items and has been operating free meditation classes since 2009. The gift shop is best known for its role in the development of the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States, Delta Beta Tau, at San Diego State University (SDSU). 
History.
The store was founded in 1998 by an elderly couple in the Campus Plaza Shopping center near San Diego State University (SDSU), in the same plaza as a Thai restaurant also owned by the couple. When the original owners planned on retiring in 2009, they asked the founders of Dharma Bum Temple to take over "Buddha For You". The founders were reluctant to take on running the store, but agreed hoping it would assist with their temple work and create revenue for the temple. After "Buddha For You" was acquired by Dharma Bum Temple, the temple set up free meditation classes at the shop. The shop was not profitable but its free meditation classes became popular among college students from the nearby college campus of SDSU, with students eventually starting a meditation club on campus as a result. In 2011, the store moved to another building in the same plaza, which was done in the style of a pilgrimage. Over 150 people joined the move, which was led a Tibetan lama chanting Om mani padme hum as volunteers carried the store inventory into location by foot.
In September 2015, SDSU students who regularly attended the meditation classes at "Buddha For You" began a Buddhist college fraternity at the suggestion of store co-owner Jeffrey Zlotnik. The co-ed fraternity, Delta Beta Tau, became the first Buddhist college fraternity in the United States. In 2017, the gift shop moved again, consolidating into the first floor of Dharma Bum Temple, which had moved locations, and transferred its status to a non-profit.

Pryse's Cambrian Book Register

Pryse's Cambrian Book Register was a 19th-century bilingual (Welsh and English language) periodical, first produced by bookseller and printer John Pryse (1826-1883) in Llanidloes in 1857.
Only one edition of the Register was ever published. However, the aim of the periodical was to create a register of all Welsh books and books of Welsh interest, as well as a list of books sold by Pryse himself. This was perhaps the first attempt at creating a complete record of published Welsh language literature.

Laius complex

The Laius complex revolves around the paternal wish for filicide, particularly for the extinction of the male heir, in an attempt to ensure one will have no successors.
Mythological background.
Indo-European mythology contains a number of stories of foundlings, like Cyrus the Great or Romulus and Remus, outcast after a prophesy that they will replace the dynasty into which they are born. In Greek mythology, Cronus (Roman Saturn) had devoured his young because of his fear that one would supersede him. Laius in the story of Oedipus similarly casts the latter out to die as an infant because of (in the words of Sophocles) "some wicked spell … . Saying the child would kill its father".
From myth to complex.
Whereas Freud had laid stress on Oedipus’s filial violence against his father, George Devereux in 1953 introduced the term 'Laius complex' to cover the corresponding feelings on the part of the father – what he called the "'counter-oedipal' (Laius) complex". Later explorations of masculinity have placed the aggressive aspects of the Laius complex within the broader frame of mammalian aggression against their young: what Gershon Legman called "the killing of the male (i.e. sexually uninteresting) children by the father".
Two specific psychosexual aspects of the complex have been particularly highlighted. One lays stress on the magical thinking behind the complex – the unconscious belief that if one has no successors, one will be effectively immortal. The other emphasises the narcissism in the Laius/Oedipus relationship – the belief that there is only room for a single figure to exist in life, leading inevitably to the destruction of the one or the other competitor, father or son.
How far the playing down of the Laius neurosis (in orthodox psychoanalysis) can be linked to what Julia Kristeva called Freud's "paternal vision of childhood", remains for the 21st century an open question.
Bracha L. Ettinger introduced a Laius Complex 'per se', not in terms of 'counter-Oedipus' but prior to it, in the frame of feminist psychoanalysis in terms of the analyst's desire to destroy the patient and exploit its creativity and sexuality, not as a counter-transferential reaction to the patient (as 'son' or 'daughter'), but as a direct transference of the analyst toward the patient. Manifestations of such Laius Complex during treatment are, according to Ettinger, close to psychosis (not neurosis), and can lead to the production of psychotic folie-a-deux.

Streamlining theory

Genomic streamlining is a theory in evolutionary biology and microbial ecology that suggests that there is a reproductive benefit to prokaryotes having a smaller genome size with less non-coding DNA and fewer non-essential genes. There is a lot of variation in prokaryotic genome size, with the smallest free-living cell's genome being roughly ten times smaller than the largest prokaryote. Two of the bacterial taxa with the smallest genomes are "Prochlorococcus" and "Pelagibacter ubique," both highly abundant marine bacteria commonly found in oligotrophic regions. Similar reduced genomes have been found in uncultured marine bacteria, suggesting that genomic streamlining is a common feature of bacterioplankton. This theory is typically used with reference to free-living organisms in oligotrophic environments.
Overview.
Genome streamlining theory states that certain prokaryotic genomes tend to be small in size in comparison to other prokaryotes, and all eukaryotes, due to selection against the retention of non-coding DNA. The known advantages of small genome size include faster genome replication for cell division, fewer nutrient requirements, and easier co-regulation of multiple related genes, because gene density typically increases with decreased genome size. This means that an organism with a smaller genome is likely to be more successful, or have higher fitness, than one hindered by excessive amounts of unnecessary DNA, leading to selection for smaller genome sizes.
Some mechanisms that are thought to underlie genome streamlining include deletion bias and purifying selection. Deletion bias is the phenomenon in bacterial genomes where the rate of DNA loss is naturally higher than the rate of DNA acquisition. This is a passive process that simply results from the difference in these two rates. Purifying selection is the process by which extraneous genes are selected against, making organisms lacking this genetic material more successful by effectively reducing their genome size. Genes and non-coding DNA segments that are less crucial for an organism survival will be more likely to be lost over time.
This selective pressure is stronger in large marine prokaryotic populations, because intra-species competition favours fast, efficient and inexpensive replication. This is because large population sizes increase competition among members of the same species, and thus increases selective pressure and causes the reduction in genome size to occur more readily among organisms of large population sizes, like bacteria. This may explain why genome streamlining seems to be particularly prevalent in prokaryotic organisms, as they tend to have larger population sizes than eukaryotes.
It has also been proposed that having a smaller genome can help minimize overall cell size, which increases a prokaryotes surface-area to volume ratio. A higher surface-area to volume ratio allows for more nutrient uptake proportional to their size, which allows them to outcompete other larger organisms for nutrients. This phenomenon has been noted particularly in nutrient depleted waters.
Genomic signatures.
Genomic analysis of streamlined organisms have shown that low GC content, low percentage of non-coding DNA, and a low fraction of genes encoding for cytoplasmic membrane proteins, periplasmic proteins, transcriptionally related proteins, and signal transduction pathways are all characteristic of free-living streamlined prokaryotic organisms. Oftentimes, highly streamlined organisms are difficult to isolate by culturing in a laboratory (SAR11 being a central example).
Model organisms.
"Pelagibacter ubique" (SAR11).
"Pelagibacter ubique" are members of the SAR11 clade, a heterotrophic marine group which are found throughout the oceans and are rather common. These microbes have the smallest genome and encode the smallest number of Open Reading Frames of any known non-sessile microorganism. "P. ubique" has complete biosynthetic pathways and all necessary enzymes for the synthesis of 20 amino acids and only lack a few cofactors despite the genome's small size. The genome size for this microorganism is achieved by lack of, "pseudogenes, introns, transposons, extrachromosomal elements, or inteins". The genome also contains fewer paralogs compared to other members of the same clade and the shortest intergenic spacers for any living cell. In these organisms, unusual nutrient requirements were found due to the streamlining selection and gene loss when selection occurred for more efficient resource utilization in oceans with limited nutrients for uptake. These observations indicate that some microbes may be difficult to grow in a laboratory setting because of unusual nutrient requirements.
"Prochlorococcus".
"Prochlorococcus" is one of the dominant cyanobacteria and is a main participant in primary production in oligotrophic waters. It is the smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organism recorded on Earth. As a cyanobacteria, they have an incredible ability to adapt to environments with very poor nutrient availability, as they maintain their energy from light. The nitrogen assimilation pathway in this organism has been significantly modified to adapt to the nutritional limitations of the organisms’ habitats. These adaptations led to the removal of key enzymes from the genome, such as nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, and often urease. Unlike some cyanobacterial counterparts, "Prochlorococcus" is not able to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N). The only nitrogen sources found to be used by this species are ammonia, which is incorporated into glutamate via the enzyme glutamine synthetase and uses less energy compared to nitrate usage, and in certain species, urea. Moreover, metabolic regulation systems of "Prochlorococcus" were found to be greatly simplified.
Nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacteria (UCYN-A).
Nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacteria are known to support oxygen production in oceans by fixing inorganic nitrogen using the enzyme nitrogenase. A special subset of these bacteria, UCYN-A, was found to lack the photosystem II complex usually used in photosynthesis and that it lacks a number of major metabolic pathways but is still capable of using the electron transport chain to generate energy from a light source. Furthermore, anabolic enzymes needed for creating amino acids such as valine, leucine and isoleucine are missing, as well as some which lead to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.
This organism seems to be an obligate photoheterotroph that uses carbon substrates for energy production and some biosynthetic materials for biosynthesis. It was discovered that UCYN-A developed a reduced genome of only 1.44 Megabases that is smaller but similar in structure to that of chloroplasts. In comparison with related species such as "Crocosphaera watsonii" and "Cyanothece" sp., which employ genomes which range in length from 5.46 to 6.24 megabases, the UCYN-A genome is much smaller. The compacted genome is a single, circular chromosome with “1,214 identified protein-coding regions”. The genome of UCYN-A is also highly conserved ( &gt;97% nucleotide identity) across ocean waters, which is atypical of ocean microbes. The lack of UCYN-A genome diversity, presence of nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzymes for the TCA cycle, reduced genome size and coding efficiency of the DNA suggest that this microorganism may have symbiotic lifestyle and live in close association with a host. However, the true lifestyle of this microbe remains unknown.
Alternative cases of small genomes.
Bacterial symbionts, commensals, parasites, and pathogens.
Bacterial symbionts, commensals, parasites, and pathogens often have even smaller genomes and fewer genes than free-living organisms, and non-pathogenic bacteria. They reduce their "core" metabolic repertoire, making them more dependent on their host and environment. Their genome reduction occurs by different evolutionary mechanisms than those of streamlined free-living organisms. Pathogenic organisms are thought to undergo genome reduction due to genetic drift, rather than purifying selection. Genetic drift is caused by small and effective populations within a microbial community, rather than large and dominating populations. In this case, DNA mutations happen by chance, and thus often lead to maladaptive genome degradation and lower overall fitness. Rather than losing non-coding DNA regions or extraneous genes to increase fitness during replication, they lose certain "core" metabolic genes that may now be supplemented by their host, symbiont, or environment. Since their genome reduction is less dependent on fitness, pseudogenes are frequent in these organisms. They also typically undergo low rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
Viruses.
Viral genomes resemble prokaryotic genomes in that they have very few non-coding regions. They are, however, significantly smaller than prokaryotic genomes. While viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, viral genomes are considered streamlined due to the strong purifying selection that occurs when the virus has successfully infected a host. During the initial phase of an infection, there is a large bottleneck for the virus population which allows for more genetic diversity, but due to the rapid replication of these viruses, the population size is restored quickly and the diversity within the population is reduced.
RNA viruses in particular are known to have exceptionally small genomes. This is at least in part due to the fact that they have overlapping genes. By reducing their genome size, they increase their fitness due to faster replication. The virus will then be able to increase population size more rapidly with faster replication rates.
Eukaryotes - birds.
Genomic streamlining has been used to explain certain eukaryotic genome sizes as well, particularly bird genomes. Larger genomes require a larger nucleus, which typically translates to a larger cell size. For this reason, many bird genomes have also been under selective pressure to decrease in size. Flying with a larger mass due to larger cells is more energetically expensive than with a smaller mass.

Królewicz (f. królewna; plural forms "królewicze" and "królewny") was the title given to the sons and daughters of the king of Poland (and Grand Duke of Lithuania at the same time), later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was similar in its distinctiveness to the Spanish and Portuguese title of infante, also reserved to the children of the monarch. Though, it was used only to denote one's status as a King's child. "Królewicz" and "królewna" has no direct equivalent in other languages and was translated to the English "prince" and German "prinz", like dynasts of a royal house. "Królewicze" since the 16th century could not also be regarded as and equivalent to the princes of the blood, because the Polish monarchy was not hereditary since 1573, when after the death of the last Jagiellon king, future Henry III of France was elected. In official Latin titulature children of Polish kings were often styled as "Poloniae princeps" or "princeps Poloniae", meaning Prince/ss of Poland or Polish prince/ss. In more official way, the full style of sons of monarchs was "Dei Gratia regius princeps Poloniae et Lithuaniae" for the sons.

A youth international since 2015, he began playing club football with the under-17 side of Tabuan Muda that played in the 2016 Brunei Premier League. His first club goal came when he scored the matchwinner against Rimba Star on 2 April. That goal helped Tabuan U17 finish in third place, with 18 points from nine matches. They also made it all the way to the semi-finals of the DST FA Cup where they were beaten by Najip I-Team in a feisty encounter.
Hariz moved up to the 'A' team of Tabuan Muda for the 2017 Brunei Super League season. He played regularly for Takao Fujiwara's boys and contributed four goals in that season, including the leveller in a fortunate 2–2 draw against Lun Bawang on 9 July. Tabuan Muda 'A' finished the season in sixth place.
Fresh after his inclusion to the full national team, Hariz was snapped up by Brunei's professional club DPMM FC in February 2018 after a trial. He made his debut at home against Albirex Niigata (S) in a 1–3 loss on 7 August later that year.
After making four appearances for the "Gegar Gegar" men, Hariz left DPMM FC for Kasuka FC in 2019, scoring two goals in his short stint there. He joined MS ABDB in 2021.
International career.
Hariz's first international tournament was the 2015 AFF U-16 Youth Championship hosted by Cambodia in July–August. He scored a consolation in the 66th minute against Vietnam in the second group game which Brunei lost 1–6. He appeared in all five matches as Brunei finished bottom of their table. He was pushed into a higher age category a month later at the 2016 AFC U-19 Championship qualification matches that were held in Myanmar. Brunei only retained five players from the squad that went to Laos for the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship a month ago. Appearing against Vietnam and Hong Kong, Hariz suffered a 0–5 drubbing in both games.
Exactly two years later, Hariz travelled with Tabuan Muda 'A' to Myanmar for the 2017 AFF U-18 Youth Championship. After a thrilling 2–3 win over the Philippines, heavy defeats by Vietnam, Myanmar and Indonesia curtailed the Young Wasps' progress to the knockout phase. The following November, Hariz was back on board for the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship qualification games to be played in Paju, South Korea. In the first match against Indonesia, he directed a header into his own net for the second goal in a 5–0 loss. This was followed by a 0–11 whitewash by the home team. Brunei fared better in the next match against neighbours Malaysia when the Young Wasps managed to frustrate their opponents right until the 76th minute. Blocking an attempt at goal, Hariz unfortunately deflected Zafuan Azeman's shot which looped past Abdul Mutalip Muhammad to give Malaysia a 1–0 win.
Despite the setbacks, Hariz never lost heart coming into the final game against Timor-Leste. Getting the nod to start the game by Fujiwara, Hariz netted a fine goal in the 34th minute to level the match after Danilson had given Timor-Leste the lead. The match ended in a 2–2 draw after further goals by Hanif Aiman Adanan and Danilson from the penalty spot.
Due to his performances in the local league as well as in his international appearances, Hariz earned a callup to the Brunei national team for the 2017 Aceh World Solidarity Tsunami Cup organised by Indonesia in December. Had the tournament be classified as full 'A'-international matches as previously planned, his second-half appearance against Indonesia would have made Hariz the first Bruneian international that was born after the millennium.

Winchester House, demolished, housed the Bishops of Winchester from 1664 to the early 19th century when in London. Their diocese for this purpose had bought the 17th-century part of Chelsea Place from Charles Cheyne in 1664. It replaced in function the shell remnants of Winchester Palace on the South Bank, Southwark left by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (English Civil War). In 1821, after the house fell into disrepair, the bishop gained an Act that allowed the sale of the house and its ground of 2.5 acres to the trustees of the Cadogan Estate. In 1825, the trustees obtained a further Act to demolish the property and build new houses on the site. Demolition was complete by 1836, but the site was still vacant in 1847. By 1850, there were ten houses at the northern end, and four at the southern by 1851. The area is now known as Oakley Street.

Isidre Bonsoms i Sicart

Isidre Bonsoms i Sicart (1849 – 14 November 1922) was a Catalan bibliophile and cervantist.
He was born in Barcelona. In 1910 he donated to the Biblioteca de Catalunya an important collection of historical-political leaflets regarding events of the history of Catalonia from the 16th to the 19th centuries, most of them printed in Catalonia.
It contains relations of events, legal dispositions, public announcements, edicts, flying sheets and satirical posters. He had also gathered a large number of legal proceedings and decisions, political speeches, sermons preached regarding diverse events, printed matter of local interest, novels and other brief treatises of different topics. It includes relations, notices and news gazettes, too.
In 1914 Bonsoms communicated to the Biblioteca de Catalunya his plan of donating the Cervantine Collection of 3,367 volumes by, or relating to, Miguel de Cervantes. Delivered in 1915, it is one of the leading collections on the topic of Cervantes, including the words of Cervantes works in original language and translations, works of biographical character and literary criticism, as well as inspired or adapted works of Cervantine iconography. , the collection consists of approximately 9,000 volumes and includes the first editions of every Cervantine work in original language and translations; except for "La Galatea", which is conserved in the form of a very rare second edition. The Collection includes the first six editions of "Don Quixote" (part 1, 1605), bibliophile items and publications of the Cervantine work in more than 50 languages. Bonsoms died in Valldemossa, Mallorca, aged 73.
In honor of the donor, the Institut d'Estudis Catalans created the Isidre Bonsoms Award to recognize "the best work of investigation, publishing, bibliography, art, critic[ism], biography or music on Cervantes works and on the novels and stories of knighthood and adventures that preceded "Don Quixote", as well as on those that it has motivated or influenced".

Ponerorchis parceflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-east Sichuan, Chongqing). The epithet has been mis-spelt "parciflora" by some authors.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1902 by Achille Eugène Finet, as "Peristylus tetralobus" f. "parceflorus". It was later raised to a full species and transferred to the genus "Amitostigma" as "Amitostigma parceflorum". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis parceflora".

Lithocarpus jacobsii

Lithocarpus jacobsii is a tree in the beech family Fagaceae. It is named for the Dutch botanist Marius Jacobs. Trees in Lithocarpus are commonly known as the stone oaks and differ from "Quercus" primarily because they produce insect-pollinated flowers. 
Description.
"Lithocarpus jacobsii" grows as a tree up to tall with a trunk diameter of up to . The brown bark is smooth or lenticellate. The coriaceous leaves are unusual and distinctive because of their cordate base that often seems to clasp the stem on a short petiole. The oblong leaves can be quite large, measuring up to long and are glabrous and the same color on both the upper and lower sides (concolorous), with prominent secondary veins below and a looping marginal vein. 
The infructescence can be quite long with numerous clusters of fruit scattered along the rachis. The fruits are generally in clusters of 3 (and up to 10). The cupules only cover the lower part of the nut and have squamose scales arranging loosely in cyclical series. The brown nuts are also glabrous and ovoid to roundish and measure up to across.
Distribution and habitat.
"Lithocarpus jacobsii" is endemic to Borneo. Its habitat is mixed dipterocarp to lower montane forests up to altitude.

Stanley and the Women (novel)

Stanley and the Women () is a 1984 novel by British author Kingsley Amis.
Plot.
Stanley Duke works in advertising, and had been married to an actress, Nowell. He is now married to Susan, with whom he has a complicated relationship, seemingly because of her mother, Lady Daly. His son, Steve, suffers a mental breakdown, and Stanley takes him to two psychiatrists. The first, Dr. Collings, is female and too liberated for Stanley; and the second, Dr. Nash, seems to be more interested in drinking than helping his son.
A doctor's suggestion that all women are mad becomes an increasing obsession with Stanley (in parallel with Steve's increasing insanity) culminating in outbursts of offensive misogynistic bigotry. Various ironic episodes of middle-class London life - including a successful dinner party; a less successful drunken evening with Nowell's second husband; Stanley's removal from his job; and others - all drive continuing reassessments of the characters. The ending floats a possibility that all women are in fact terrifyingly sane.
Reception.
Marilyn Butler for the "London Review of Books" says that Amis "has created a world in which only men appear to communicate with one another, and their favourite topic is their dislike of women". Amis' son, Martin, called it "a mean little novel in every sense, sour, spare, and viciously well-organized".
Adaptation.
The novel was adapted for the television by Nigel Kneale and directed by David Tucker, it was produced by Central Independent Television for the ITV network.

2018 Maldivian presidential election

Presidential elections were held in the Maldives on 23 September 2018. Incumbent president Abdulla Yameen of the Progressive Party of Maldives was seeking re-election for a second five-year term. His only challenger was Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the Maldivian Democratic Party, who was nominated as the joint candidate of a coalition of opposition parties.
The result was a surprise victory for Solih, who received over 58% of the vote and was elected as the seventh President of the Maldives. He assumed office on 17 November 2018. Solih is the country's third democratically elected president since Mohamed Nasheed's victory over Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in the 2008 elections which ended a 30-year incumbency.
Yameen is the fourth consecutive Maldivian president to have at some point lost a bid for re-election. Namely, Yameen himself came to office by defeating former president Mohamed Nasheed, who was running for a second non-consecutive term in 2013, after having resigned in 2012 during the 2011–12 Maldives political crisis. Nasheed's successor in office, his Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan also sought re-election in 2013, but decided not to contest the re-run after the initial election was annulled. Finally, Nasheed had been elected in the 2008 election by defeating long-term incumbent Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
Electoral system.
The President of the Maldives is elected using the two-round system. However, as there were only two candidates, the 2018 election was a simple one-round majority vote.
Candidates.
Incumbent President Abdulla Yameen ran for re-election. In February 2018 former President Mohamed Nasheed announced that he intended to contest the elections as the Maldivian Democratic Party candidate. However, in June 2018 the party selected Ibrahim Mohamed Solih as its candidate after Nasheed withdrew his candidacy.
Campaign.
President Abdulla Yameen ran on a campaign of economic development and Islamism aimed at "courting religious vote", claiming that the opposition was supported by Christian priests. His government was close to the Chinese government, signing a free trade agreement and obtaining Chinese money for infrastructure projects. The opposition sought to improve relations with India.
A few days before the elections, Yameen promised to build housing for all citizens, as well as scrapping fines for traffic violations and utility bills. Several hundred prisoners were also freed.
Conduct.
Prior to the elections, there were concerns about vote rigging by the government as Yameen had appointed one of his supporters, Ahmed Shareef, as head of the Electoral Commission. International observers were banned from monitoring the elections and foreign media was heavily restricted.
The police raided the Democratic Party's headquarters on the day before the elections, claiming there was an investigation into "distributing money to buy votes". The raid was condemned by the American and British governments. The European Union had said that it would not send election observers because the Maldives had failed to meet the basic conditions for monitoring, and the U.S. had threatened to sanction Maldivian officials if the elections were not free and fair. President Yameen had previously restricted observers from seeing individual ballots, and had appointed 107 members of the ruling PPM party to administer and count the vote. Some election observers were also denied entry to the country because they were not given a visa, despite being registered with the Electoral Commission. Foreign journalists were also required to have a Maldivian sponsor to participate, and some observers described having their visa applications denied for trivial reasons.
On election day, voting was extended for three hours due to long queues.

Results.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Aftermath.
Following the announcement of the results, Yameen challenged the outcome in the Supreme Court in October, claiming that the election had been rigged. He alleged that ballot papers treated to make any votes cast for him vanish and that voters planning on voting for him were given pens with disappearing ink. His appeal was unanimously rejected by the court's judges, who stated that he had failed to prove the claims.
Geopolitical implications.
Maldives is of high geo-strategic importance due to its proximity to Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, Indian Navy base in Lakshadweep Islands and US Navy base in Diego Garcia. Abdulla Yameen was seen by India as being too close to regional rival China. India was particularly alarmed about Chinese Belt and Road Initiative projects in the Maldives and Chinese investments in Maldives were seen by India and the United States as a part of China's 'String of Pearls' strategy. On the other hand, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had made repairing of ties with India as a key election plank. According to "The Nikkei", India's Modi administration had "spared no expense supporting local opposition parties by allotting tens of millions of dollars to intelligence agencies".
"The Financial Times" declared the victory of Solih as a "diplomatic win" for India. 
Following the declaration of election results, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to congratulate him on his victory. Solih reaffirmed commitment towards rebuilding ties with India and declared Maldives to be "India's closest ally". The Observer Research Foundation noted that following the election results, "China will mount a major effort to protect its strategic investments and ongoing projects in Maldives" and that India will have to "use other tools to ensure that Maldives does not cross strategic red lines like allowing China to build military and security facilities on any island."

Helga Foght

Helga Elisabeth Foght (1902–1974) was a Danish textile artist who specialized in calico printing. She opened her own screen-printing workshop in 1937, first creating floral designs but later adopting a more abstract or strip-based approach. Many of her designs were used for commercial production by the L.F. Foght textile company. Foght taught at the Danish Arts and Crafts School until 1970.
Early life and education.
Born on 11 December 1902 in Copenhagen, Helga Foght was the daughter of the book dealer Villiam Rudolf Foght (1866–1951) and Dagmar Elise Kirstine Clausen (1875–1951). After being trained as a housekeeping teacher, she worked as a secretary at Askov Højskole, a folk high school, where she met Margrethe Christiansen (1895–1971) and Charlotte Rud (1906–1993) who were both intent on improving coverage of sewing and textile arts at the school. As a result, in 1934 she decided to improve her own competence in embroidery by taking a course in decorative art at "Kunsthåndværkerskolen", the Danish Arts and Crafts School. In fact, the school arranged for her to study embroidery at the Haandarbejdets Fremme textile establishment. She was also introduced to the new technique of calico printing in which she became particularly interested. She improved her knowledge of the subject by taking a course on screen printing in Berlin. At the Danish Arts and Crafts School, she also learnt woodblock printing under Marie Gudme Leth.
Career.
In 1937, Foght established her own studio where she worked with woodblock for smaller patterns and screen printing for covering cloth breadths of up to about one metre. After producing her own designs for a number of years, she began to collaborate with L.F Foght, a commercial textile establishment which was run by her father's cousin, himself an accomplished designer. This proved useful for her artistic development as she was able to experiment with more efficient approaches to pattern making, colour and materials.
Foght teamed up with a number of designers and architects to decorate restaurants and other large interiors with her curtains, upholstery and other fabrics. They were well suited to the Functionalist furniture of the times. Her designs became more rhythmical and less naturalistic than those taught at the Arts and Crafts School, eventually becoming almost entirely abstract, while displaying intricate detail. As a teacher (1952–70), she encouraged hundreds of students to experiment with new designs, colour combinations and materials.
She also played an important part in Denmark's cultural sector, serving in a number of administrative positions where she emphasized the importance of developing textile arts. She contributed journal articles on the subject, especially in connection with calico print and arranged hundreds of exhibitions throughout Denmark.
Helga Foght died in Gentofte on 23 November 1974.
Awards.
Helga Foght received a number of grants and scholarships for her work. In 1951, she received a gold medal at the Milan Triennial IX, while in 1970, she was honoured as a Knight of the Dannebrog for her pioneering contributions to Danish textile art.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in Yorkshire and the Humber

The region of Yorkshire and the Humber is divided into 54 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 25 Borough Constituencies and 29 County Constituencies. Since the general election of December 2019, 26 are represented by Conservative MPs and 28 by Labour MPs.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the Yorkshire and the Humber region will be unchanged, at 54.

Reforma o ruptura

Reforma o ruptura () is the expression used to synthesize the political dilemma faced by Spanish society in the aftermath of the death of Spanish leader Francisco Franco.
After the death of Franco, Spanish society as a whole was not politically active, especially compared to other Western European countries, due to Francoist Spain's sheer length (36 years); citizen political affiliation was very low. There were some demonstrations, especially demanding the amnesty of political prisoners; however, the protests never were a threat to the political stability of Spain. The political and social unrest was concentrated in the Basque Country and in Navarre (due to the repression of Basque nationalism) and, to a lesser extent, in Catalonia.
However, the uncertainty regarding the continuity of the Francoist State boosted political activism, leading to the configuration of a debate on the political future of Spain in which there were essentially two options, with the possibility of a "Francoism without Franco" () being rejected early on:

The instrumental passages on the soundtrack, entitled the "Paradox Passages", were recorded in the studio by Young and Promise of the Real without re-watching any of the film's footage: "We'd seen it, so we just remembered it. There are similarities [with "Dead Man"], but I like to do that. It's an easy way for me to express a soundtrack: I have the same thing in "The LinkVolt Years"."
The tracks "Show Me" and "Peace Trail" were previously recorded in a different form for Young's 2016 solo album, "Peace Trail". The full-band recording of "Peace Trail", included on "Paradox", was the first time Young and Promise of the Real had performed the song together. The live version of "Pocahontas" is from a 2014 performance. Also, the song "Tumbleweed" is a re-recorded version from his 2014 album "Storytone", and the song "Hey" contains a guitar riff from the song "Love and Only Love" from Neil’s album with Crazy Horse "Ragged Glory".
Band member Lukas Nelson performs a cover of "Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground" by his father, Willie Nelson. Regarding capturing this performance for the film, director Daryl Hannah noted, "It's effortless magic that always happens between them. It's a real gift to witness the creative freedom they have around each other."
Reception.
In a mostly positive review for Pitchfork, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: "Drifting between spooky guitar solos, sweet strums, and half-remembered choruses, this soundtrack occasionally stops for a full-fledged song, but these complete moments feel accidental, as if the fog lifts just long enough to reveal a full landscape." Uncut's Michael Bonner wrote: "In many respects, the ramshackle, campfire vibe of the soundtrack mirrors Hannah’s film itself – but, critically, it is neither a fully immersive experience like the "Dead Man" soundtrack or a third album with Promise of the Real. It’s perhaps best not to view "Paradox" (either film or soundtrack) as a major work from a significant artist, but yet another of Young’s shaggy digressions."

Stabilization Plan

The Stabilization Plan of 1959 () or the National Plan of Economic Stabilization () were a series of economic measures taken by the Spanish Government in 1959. Its main goal was the economic liberalization of the Spanish markets, marking a turning point from the previous policies oriented towards achieving autarky.
The Plan led to an economic boom in Spain for most of the 1960s. The monetary reserves of the Bank of Spain increased, inflation dropped from 12.6% in 1958 to 2.4% in 1960, Spain attracted foreign investment, and the relaxation of tariffs led to the import of new technologies. On the negative side, unemployment increased due to the decrease in production caused by higher imports, which lowered the demand for national products. This decrease in production also led to lower consumption and wage freezes.

Derby St Luke's F.C.

Derby St Luke's Football Club was an English amateur association football club based in Derby that existed from the 1870s to the 1890s. They competed in the FA Cup between 1884 and 1888.
History.
Founded in 1870 and nicknamed the Churchmen, the club's origins lay in connection with the recently built St Luke's Church on Parliament Street. Their regular home ground on Peet Street was situated just north of the church; they also staged some important games at the County Cricket Ground. They moved to the Vulcan Ground in 1890. St Luke's were one of the founder members of the Derbyshire Football Association in 1883. By the 1880s, they were entering the Derbyshire, Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire and Birmingham Senior Cup competitions. In the 1884–85 Birmingham Cup, they recorded a 13–1 away victory over Sawley Rangers. In November of that season, they lost 3–1 to the recently formed Derby County in a Derbyshire Cup tie at the County Ground; 3,000 people watched what was both the latter's first competitive match and their first home win.
St Luke's entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1884-85, and were drawn against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first round. After drawing 1–1 at Wolves' Dudley Road ground in front of a crowd of 3,100, St Luke's won the replay in Derby 4–2. In the second round, they lost 1–0 against Walsall Swifts. They played in the FA Cup for the next three seasons but lost in the first round on each occasion. In 1885-86, Wolves gained revenge with a 7–0 win. In 1886-87 they faced Walsall Town, drawing 3–3 at home but losing 6–1 in the replay at The Chuckery. In their final appearance in 1887-88, St Luke's lost 3–2 to local rivals Derby Junction, who went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition. Qualifying rounds were introduced the following season, and St Luke's were subsequently unsuccessful in reaching the competition proper, reaching the 2nd qualifying round twice and the 3rd qualifying round on one occasion.
Along with other local amateur clubs, St Luke's struggled to compete for players and support following the emergence of Derby County, and particularly once the latter became a founder member of the Football League in 1888. St Luke's joined the Combination as a founder member for the 1890–91 season, but they failed to complete their fixtures and their record was expunged;. They scratched their Derbyshire Cup tie and the following season, 1891-1892, scratched before the draw of the first round. On St. Luke's demise, (Derby) St. Luke's Sunday School took the decision to shorten their name from 1892-1893. A cul-de-sac called Olive Street was built across the site of their former ground.
Goalkeeper WE Parsons appears to have played the most competitive games for the club having played 33 games (11 FA Cup, 16 Derbyshire County FA Senior Cup, 6 Birmingham and District FA Cup). G Halksworth appears to have scored the most competitive goals for the club, scoring 11 goals (3 FA Cup, 8 Derbyshire County FA Senior Cup)

Ibn Masal

Najm al-Din Abu'l-Fath Salim/Sulayman ibn Muhammad al-Lukki al-Maghribi (), better known as Ibn Masal (), was a military commander and official of the Fatimid Caliphate, who served briefly as the "de facto" vizier of the Caliphate from 1144/45 until he was overthrown and killed by al-Adil ibn al-Sallar and his supporters in the winter of 1149/50.
Life.
His "nisbah" (al-Maghribī) and the name Maṣāl suggest a Berber origin. He was born in the town of Lukk in the Cyrenaica. From his father, he learned falconry and veterinary science, which enabled him to assume a military post in the Fatimid capital Cairo. Details of his military career are not known, but by 1144/45 he had risen to the point where he was entrusted with the leadership of the government by Caliph al-Hafiz. He was not given the title of vizier, however, which had been vacant since the ouster of Ridwan ibn Walakhshi in 1139, but instead was titled "supervisor of affairs" ("nāẓir fi'l-umūr") and "supervisor of the public interests" ("nāẓir fi'l-maṣāliḥ").
When al-Hafiz died in October 1149, his 16-year-old son al-Zafir succeeded him. Al-Zafir, who was more interested in the pleasures of the court than exercising governance, appointed Ibn Masal, despite the latter's advanced age, as his vizier. Ibn Masal received the customary titles of the Fatimid viziers, "al-Sayyid al-ʿAjal" ("most noble master"), "Amīr al-Juyūsh" ("commander of the armies"), and "al-Mufaḍḍal" ("the preferred one") or "al-Afḍal" ("most superior one"). He was quickly successful in calming the quarrels between the Turkish cavalry ("Rayḥānī") and the black military slaves by distributing money and promising to take care of their future welfare.
He was soon after confronted with the rebellion of the governor of Alexandria, Ibn al-Sallar, who had entertained hopes of becoming vizier himself. Following the appointment of Ibn Masal, together with his stepson Abbas, Ibn al-Sallar marched on Cairo to seize the vizierate. When al-Zafir learned of Ibn Sallar's intentions, he called upon assistance from the grandees of the realm in support of Ibn Masal, but they proved unwilling to. In the end, the Caliph provided Ibn Masal with funds to raise an army for action against Ibn al-Sallar. Ibn Masal assembled a force of Lawata Berbers, of blacks, of Bedouin Arabs and of native Egyptians, but despite a first success in the field, he was soon forced to leave Cairo in December 1149 for Upper Egypt, to recruit more men, while Ibn al-Sallar took over the city. Ibn al-Sallar sent his stepson Abbas with an army against Ibn Masal and his ally, Badr ibn Rafi, who had tried unsuccessfully to rally resistance among the Arab tribes of the Nile Delta. The two armies met in battle at Dalas in the province of al-Bahnasa on 19 February 1150, in which Ibn Masal was defeated and killed. Abbas brought his severed head back to Cairo as a token of victory.
His vizierate had lasted only about 50 days. This was the last time a Fatimid caliph would exercise that right, as with Ibn al-Sallar's coup the vizierate became the object of fierce contest between rival strongmen, and the last Fatimid caliphs were reduced to mere figureheads.

And from there on, they were able to seal the victory and draw the first blood in the title series.
Game 2.
Jaymo Eguilos of the Athletics scored a jumper to extend their lead to 9, 74–65, with the final 1:14 left on the clock. After that shot, the Cagers went on to storm a 9-2 scoring run to cut the deficit to 2 points, 76–74, going in to the final 17 seconds. With Batangas holding to their tight defense, Teytey Teodoro was able to draw a foul on Chito Jaime, resulting to two charities being made as they hold on to their four-point victory, extending the series lead to 2–0 and one more win gives them the inaugural league championship and the possible first-ever finals sweep in the history of the league.
Game 3.
This game marked the first loss of the Athletics since losing to the Bulacan Kuyas in the elimination round last March 3, also marks the team's first loss of the playoffs. In the fourth quarter, Batangas scared Muntinlupa with an 11-5 scoring run after being down by 15 points, 64–49, in the 1:04 mark of third quarter, with this run, the deficit was cut down to 9, 69–60, in the 6:38 mark of fourth quarter. But as Athletics not giving up to the fight, they would eventually cut down further the Cagers lead as close as 2, 79–77, in the final 49 seconds of the game. Dave Moralde had an answer to stop the bleeding, to reextend the lead to 4 with a one-hand jumper. As they were able to hold to their defense, they would eventually spoil the possible championship celebration and extend the series to a Game 4.
Game 4.
The Muntinlupa Cagers entered the match facing a do-or-die situation, with a 1–2 series deficit. In the early minutes of the fourth period, the Athletics led by 9 points, 57–48. However, a 10-0 run was blasted by the Cagers to regain the lead, 58–57, which all of the 10 points in the run came from Pari Llagas. Then the succeeding minutes, it was a seesaw battle where no team led more than 4 points. In the final 3.6 seconds of the game, Muntinlupa had a chance to send the game to an overtime coming off a foul from Mark Olayon. However, Llagas missed both charities that sealed the victory and the first MPBL Championship for the Batangas City Athletics.

Discharge by purchase

Discharge by purchase, colloquially called buying oneself out of service, is the obtaining of a military discharge by payment. The purchase price is in effect a fine for leaving military service earlier than the date contracted for when enlisting. "Discharge by purchase" pertains to voluntary enlistment; "exemption by purchase" is a similar privilege pertaining to conscription. In the United States military, discharge by purchase was introduced in 1890 for the Army, 1902 for the Marine Corps and 1906 for the Navy. It was abolished in 1953. In the Irish Defence Forces, it is permitted under the Defence Act 1954. Discharge by purchase was typically suspended during wartime. In the British Armed Forces, it was suspended in 1950 during the Korean War and reintroduced in 1953; accepting an application for such a discharge was at the discretion of the commanding officer.

St Edward the Confessor's Church, Leek

St Edward the Confessor's Church is an active Anglican church in Leek, Staffordshire, England.
The building, which dates back to the 13th century, is listed Grade II*. 
It is Leek's original parish church, although the parish now includes other churches such as All Saints which were built as the town's population increased.
Restorations.
Much of the church's appearance reflects two 19th century restorations. The first was by Ewan Christian, who in 1847 was appointed consulting architect to the Lichfield Diocesan Building Society. He went on to carry out many more restorations as architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The church's second restoration was by George Edmund Street, a leading practitioner of the Victorian Gothic Revival.
Glass and textiles.
There is stained glass made by Morris and Co, including a couple of designs by George Frederick Bodley. The church owns examples of the work of the Leek School of Embroidery which was founded in 1879/1880 by the embroideress Lady Elizabeth Wardle and her husband Sir Thomas Wardle. One of the windows is a memorial to her.
Churchyard.
The wall surrounding the churchyard and the lychgate are listed Grade II. The churchyard contains two early medieval (11th century according to one source) crosses which are listed Grade II and are also protected as scheduled monuments 
Double sunset.
The churchyard is notable as a place for viewing a double sunset. The phenomenon was first described by Robert Plot in a 1686 publication, but would have been visible before the arrival of Christianity in Roman Britain.
There has been speculation that the site was regarded as a holy place in pagan times and that the construction of a church was done to Christianise it.

While he was associated with All India Radio (AIR), he was also sought out as a soloist and as an accompanist in several Sangeet Sammelans in India and abroad.
Uttank comes from a musical family and hence the atmosphere around the house was that of music. His father took non-profitable music classes at home. He started training under his father from the age of 6. By the age of 10, Vora would handle his father's classes and at the age of 12, he began tutoring on his own.

Words on Bathroom Walls

Words on Bathroom Walls is a 2020 American romantic drama film directed by Thor Freudenthal and written by Nick Naveda, based on the novel of the same name by Julia Walton. The film stars Charlie Plummer, Andy García, Taylor Russell, AnnaSophia Robb, Beth Grant, Molly Parker and Walton Goggins.
"Words on Bathroom Walls" was released on August 21, 2020, by Roadside Attractions. It received generally positive reviews from critics.
Plot.
Adam Petrazelli is a high school senior who experiences an apparent psychotic break at school, is diagnosed with schizophrenia and enters a medical trial to treat his condition. Throughout the film, he is accompanied by the visions of Rebecca (new age hippie), Joaquin (the best friend) and "The Bodyguard", as well as a deep threatening voice.
Adam starts taking his new medication after transferring to St. Agatha's Catholic School. He begins to experience side effects such as muscle twitching, He makes a new friend, Maya who tutors him, but doesn't tell her about his condition. After having another psychotic break during a dinner with his mom, Adam stops taking the new pills. 
Adam takes Maya to an outdoor screening of her favorite movie, "Never Been Kissed", where Rebecca and Joaquin try to encourage Adam to express feelings to Maya but a deep voice starts to prey on his insecurity. He admits to having insecurity over his mother having another kid with Paul, but after he apologizes, he asks Maya to prom, even though she’s against the idea of it. She accepts, and they have their first kiss. His work gets so much better that he writes an essay that is accepted to be read at graduation.
His mother finds out Adam has stopped taking his medication, and berates him for this. At school, Sister Catherine has been told about this and of the incident at his last school by his mom and stepdad and she announces that the school will be suspending him temporarily, instead of expulsion, for the safety of other students. Adam lashes out at Paul for writing the email to Sister Catherine the previous night, which Adam finds suspicious. The suspension also means he can’t go to prom, but he defies everyone’s orders and goes anyway. Arriving at the prom, he picks up Maya but as they dance together, Adam is plagued by the deep voice while Sister Catherine tries to kick him out. As his vision goes erratic, Adam pushes the nun to the ground and runs away. He runs to the top bleachers and falls over the ledge.
Adam is taken to the hospital and wakes up to see Beth and Paul, and Maya soon shows up, but he breaks down after he is overwhelmed by the presence of the visions. He is later expelled from St. Agatha’s and placed in a psych ward. Father Patrick visits him, despite an earlier encounter where Adam was rude to him when he tried to offer advice. After Father Patrick says that he was not aware of what Adam was struggling with, Adam apologizes for his behavior and agrees to join Father Patrick in prayer.
Beth visits Adam in the hospital and gives him a printed copy of the email that Paul sent to St. Agatha’s. Contrary to what Adam thought, Paul was expressing his support for his stepson and thought suspending him was cruel, saying that they must show more care for Adam’s condition. Realizing how much Paul cares about him, Adam runs to catch up with him and Beth, and he hugs Paul for the first time, making it clear that he will be better at accepting him as a new father figure.
On graduation day, Beth and Paul take Adam to the ceremony, where, despite Sister Catherine’s attempt to speak up, Father Patrick shows support for Adam. The deep-voiced black cloud tries to get Adam, but he gathers the courage to address the student body calmly. He recites his essay in which he discusses both his condition and battle with schizophrenia, declaring that he now knows that his life will not be defined by his illness. After he leaves the auditorium, Maya runs to catch up with him. Adam apologizes to Maya for not telling her the truth about his illness from the beginning, at which point they express their love for each other. Joaquin then encourages Adam to kiss Maya, which he does.
With the voices still pestering on him, Adam becomes a good big brother to Beth's and Paul’s child and gets accepted into culinary school.

Bel Nunes

Isabel Cristina de Araújo Nunes (born 12 May 1966), commonly known as Bel, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a winger or forward for the Brazil women's national football team.
Club career.
While playing for Inter, Bel came to notice for her physical attractiveness and was declared the most beautiful player at the 1985 Brazilian Cup. She was described as "an icon of sensual femininity in football". She was also a skilful attacker, often likened to the male player Renato Portaluppi who was also from Porto Alegre and wore the number 7 shirt. Bel was pictured on the cover of "Placar" on four separate occasions.
In 1987 Inter abolished their women's team and Bel played futsal for local teams called Bruxas and Chimarrão. In 1994 she transferred to Torino of the Italian Serie A, where she was provided with a car and lodged with Antonella Carta. She returned to Brazil for personal reasons after only three months, when an affair with the club president Roberto Goveani "got complicated". Her final season of club football was in 2001 with Grêmio.
International career.
Bel was named as part of Brazil's squad for the 1995 South American Women's Football Championship in Uberlândia. She scored in the team's 15–0 win over Bolivia. With the national team she was a reserve to Roseli de Belo and Pretinha.
Following a dispute with the team's chief of delegation Rosilene Gomes, Bel was not selected for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup in Sweden.
Personal life.
A year after retiring from football, Bel gave birth to her son Luiz Felipe. She was treated for breast cancer in 2017, while working as a physical education teacher in Florianópolis. In July 1995 Bel posed nude for Playboy (Brazil). The publication had originally approached her when she was 17 years old, but at that stage she rejected the offer to appear nude and wore a bikini.

ABViewer

ABViewer is multifunctional software for working with AutoCAD DWG, DXF, PLT, STEP, IGES, STL and other 2D and 3D CAD files. The application allows creating and editing drawings, as well as saving them to AutoCAD DWG/DXF, PDF, JPG and a number of other vector and raster file formats.
The software was developed by CADSoftTools in 2003. Since that time, the program has been translated into more than 30 languages and now it supports more than 50 2D/3D vector and raster formats.
History.
The early version of ABViewer presented a viewer that also allowed merging CAD files, storing BMP and EMF images in the clipboard, as well as printing a group of files. Initially, the program supported 20 languages and was available in two versions: Standard and Professional. In 2007, ABViewer was no longer just a viewer. It became a tool for viewing, editing and converting files. The application had a full set of tools of a professional editor and supported operations used in design and project work. As a converter, ABViewer made it possible to convert selected parts of the image. Now depending on the functionality the program is available in three versions (Standard, Professional and Enterprise).
Features.
Viewer.
ABViewer allows viewing 2D and 3D drawings. It supports work with drawing layers and layouts; users can reposition drawings: i.e. zoom, rotate 3D models as well as change the drawing display view and mode; users can navigate through files by means of the Thumbnails window. It is possible to hide/show texts and dimensions as well as measure drawings (both in 2D and 3D modes). The program not only displays drawings but also provides access to drawing properties and structure.
Editor.
The Editor mode enables users to create drawings from scratch as well as edit loaded files. ABViewer offers a wide range of tools for working with CAD drawings: drawing tools (used to add entities); modifying instruments (for work with created drawings); different types of snap; work with blocks and external references.
Saving and printing.
ABViewer allows saving as well as printing drawings: saving to vector and raster file formats; saving DWG/DXF drawings to G-code; extended printing settings (multipage printing, print preview, plot settings). Batch operations with multiple files are available too: batch conversion and batch print.
Advanced features.
ABViewer also provides additional functionality for work with drawings: conversion of PDF drawings into editable DWG files, the Redline mode for adding markups, comparison of DWG/DXF drawing revisions, georeferencing, work from the command line, LISP support as well as XML support.
Supported formats.
ABViewer allows viewing more than 50 vector and raster 2D and 3D formats:
The program opens archived drawings too: ZIP, 7z, RAR, CAB, BZIP, TAR.
Localization.
ABViewer is fully translated into the following languages: Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. ABViewer documentation and detailed help system are available in English, German, French and Russian.
Reception.
Ron LaFon from the Cadalyst compared nine different CAD Viewers in 2008 and AViewer v6.2 was among them.
He stated that the program supported lots of languages (32 languages in total at that time), had “clean and easy to understand” user interface and a variety of available features.
The Digital Engineering magazine named ABViewer (version 7) a “cost-efficient high-quality application” that could be used by engineers as well as by office workers. The Thumbnail visualization of the folder contents was highlighted in particular as this feature makes the search for the required files considerably easier.
Softpedia describes ABViewer version 14 as a modern tool that can help in a variety of tasks and is easy and user-friendly even for inexperienced users.
Apart from it ABViewer is referenced to as a tool for measuring, converting and viewing CAD files in a number of modern studies and researches in different fields.

Bamboo tally

Bamboo tallies (Traditional Chinese: 錢籌; Simplified Chinese: 钱筹; Pinyin: "qián chóu"), alternatively known as "bamboo tokens" or "bamboo money", were a type of alternative currency that was produced in Eastern China (primarily in the provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang often around the cities of Suzhou and Wuxi) from the 1870s until the 1940s and were used to supplement Chinese cash coins and other small denomination Chinese currencies in a manner similar to paper money. Some bamboo tallies were issued in denominations of "wén" (文) or "strings of cash coins" (串), some bamboo tallies were denominated in "qián" (錢), "tóngyuán" (銅元, machine-struck coins of 10 wén), "jiǎo" (角), and "yáng" (洋, foreign silver coins), other than in money bamboo tallies could also be dominated in tea bags. During the same time as bamboo tallies were issued other local businesses manufactured paper money denominated in "fēn" (分) while others used either copper tokens or money made from bones in a similar fashion.
Emergency money.
Bamboo tallies were used due to the loss of authority by the Qing government that caused a shortage in currency and a loss of trust in the government. They continued to be used during the turbulent period of the Republic of China, as many local private banks at the time suffered from shortages of coinage. These banks consequently issued their own currencies as a provisional measure. Bamboo tallies continued to be used in China up until the 1960s. In addition to local private banks, bamboo tallies were also issued by local business and trading firms, exchange-offices, merchant guilds or associations, as well as playhouses. Other producers included the Jiheyi Society (a local producer of rice), the Deyuan Society (a local mat manufacturer), and the Xuyichang candy shop. The first bamboo tallies from this region were actually manufactured during the Southern Song dynasty, but modern bamboo tallies were only produced in the aftermath of the Taiping rebellion as it had devastated the local economy. They were originally produced by mat-manufacturers of Xushuan in 1877 under the Guangxu Emperor as "emergency money", and had a nominal value of 100 wén. These early bamboo tallies were initially meant to be used between their suppliers and customers from the countryside, but they began to circulate on the entire market, a practice which was not prohibited by local authorities due to the contemporary economic situation of the region. From 1895 onwards, local governments of these regions began to officially condone and later issue these bamboo tallies themselves. Several factors such as the Kuomintang takeover of China and subsequent Japanese invasion of China meant that these tokens would remain a popular medium of exchange as these events negatively affected the local economy.
Manufacture.
Bamboo tallies were manufactured from bamboo from coastal China; to make these tallies, the skin of the bamboo was removed and then the stalk would be cut into rectangles that would have a hole drilled at the top. On the obverse side the denomination of the bamboo tally was placed and in uncommon cases the date of issue using the sexagenary cycle while on the reverse side an inked serial number (sometimes using Chinese numerals and sometimes using Arabic numerals) along with the name of the issuing bank of merchant would be placed. The sides of the bamboo tallies would often be inscribed with the manufacturing company and anti-counterfeit measures such as the statement "not compensated if lost" (失去不補, "shī qù bù bǔ") and warranty marks are known as "shing hao". After the tally was fully inscribed the bamboo would be lacquered in transparent light red to improve the durability of the tally.

Hans Dorn (or Johannes Dorn) was a German printer of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, active in Brunswick
He is known to have been in Brunswick during the period of 1493–1525.
He may have been active as a bookseller before becoming a printer. The first book known to have printed by him, and at the same time the oldest known book printed in Brunswick, is a Low German "Plenarium" with the title "Dath boke der hilgen Ewangelien. Lectien. Profecien unde Epistelen", dated 15 July 1506. An earlier print by Dorn, dated 1502, is mentioned in an 18th-century source. Dorn primarily produced theological or liturgical works in Low German and Latin, such as "Summula doctrinarum Jhesu Christi" by Nikolaus Decius, "St. Annen Büchlein." (1507), "Judenspiegel." by Johannes Pfefferkorn (1507), by Henning Caldrusius (1511), "Distichoneomenion Abaci: sive Computus ecclesiastici ..." (1517), "De guldene Lettanye: Dagelicke Anropynge unde Bede tho gode, Marien, und allem hemmelischen Hehre" (1518).
From 1518, he also printed Protestant literature, such as Martin Luther's "Sermon von Ablass und Gnade" (1518)
and Gottschalk Kruse's (1521).
He also printed two medical worksm, and a travelogue of the pilgrimage from Hildesheim to Santiago de Compostela by Gerd Helmich.
His last known print dates to 1525. The year of his death is unknown. 
He does not appear to have had a direct successor, the next known printer in Brunswik is Andreas Goldbeck, active from 1539.

Kronans Apotek

Kronans Droghandel Apotek AB, doing business as Kronans Apotek, is a Swedish pharmacy company. The pharmacy chain is owned by the Finnish company Oriola Oyj-KD, which is listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Kronans Apotek has 326 pharmacies across Sweden, and over 65,000 customer visits per day.
Kronans Apotek is Sweden's third largest pharmacy chain with more than 300 stores from Trelleborg in the south to Malmberget in the north. As of April 8, 2013, Kronans Apotek AB operates as a subsidiary of Oriola Oyj. Oriola is also a pharmaceutical wholesaler and also markets supplies. Since 2013, the company operates pharmacy operations under the name of Kronans Apotek. Kronens Apotek has a turnover of around 7 billion SEK a year. In Sweden, Laastari has begun to work with Kronans Droghandel Apotek. A company named ICT has previously handled the customer service to Kronans Apotek, which, through its owner early in 2013, bought the chain Medstop with 69 pharmacies.
After deregulation, Kronans Apotek expanded their supply chain to include retail stores. This resulted in existing retailers expanding their supply chain upstream, as did Apoteket Hjärtat, who now have their own supplier, Apo-Pharma. Through the agreement between Tamro AB and Kronans Apotek, a number of pharmaceutical companies undertake to distribute drugs on the Swedish market only through one of these companies. Nowadays, the association has been handed over to the Crown's drug distribution in Gothenburg, purchasing and reselling the drugs at the price determined by the association.
Corporate affairs.
Pharmaceuticals are delivered mainly to pharmacies from the wholesalers Tambro AB and Kronans Apotek, These two companies trade in pharmaceuticals, known as single-channel distribution. Wholesalers in Sweden, two companies hold licenses to supply medical goods to pharmacies, Kronans Droghandel (KD) and Phoenix. Both wholesalers hold a market share of approximately 50%.
Sales.
In November 2017, total sales increased by more than 400% compared with the same period last year. The number of visits also doubled in comparison with the previous year.
History.
Early history (1700s-1959).
Apoteket Strutsen in Gothenburg was run by the pharmacist Franz Martin Luth in the early 1700s. In 1907, Gustaf Bernström became the owner of Kronans Apotek, and he also had a decisive influence on the pharmacy Lejonet between 1908 and 1920, when the sister who widowed Vitus Anderson formally stood as the owner of the pharmacy. In 1959 a consortium owned by the company Kronans Droghandel was bought.
Growth (1960-2009).
In 1964, sales in Kronans Apotek amounted to 31,3 million SEK, of which 28.0 million SEK were to pharmacies. Following the initialization of the apothecary in 1971, Kronans Droghandel continued with the distribution of pharmaceuticals to state-controlled Apoteket, later Apoteket AB. When the drug supply investigation in 1969 submitted its report these were: Apotekernes Droghandel AB, Kronans Droghandel, Apoteksvarva Vitrum Apotekare, Astra Distribution and AB Pharmaceutical Distribution.
2009-present.
The company was owned 80% by Oriola, and 20% by Kooperativa Förbundet KF. As of November 2012, Kronans Droghandel is owned 100% by Oriola-KD. In 2013, Oriola-KD acquired a Swedish pharmacy chain Medstop, Medstop and Kronans Droghandel were merged into a single pharmacy chain, Kronans Apotek. The purchase meant that the market share was 21% and comprised 290 pharmacies. It also meant that the addition of KD helped boost the company's distribution wing to represent some 72% of Orion's total revenue. That company remained separate from Oriola. In September 2017, Kronans Apotek was nominated for Svenska Designpriset along with at least 4 apps. On January 1, 2018, Kronans Apotek will replace old plastic bags with new ones with 100% recycled plastic LDPE.

2018 Basketball Champions League Final Four

The 2018 Basketball Champions League (BCL) Final Four was the second concluding Basketball Champions League Final Four tournament. It was the concluding phase of the 2017–18 Basketball Champions League season, which marked the second season of Basketball Champions League (BCL). The Final Four took place on 4–6 May 2018. The O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, home arena of hosts AEK Athens, hosted the tournament. AEK won the league title after defeating Monaco in the final.
Venue.
On 5 April 2018, the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece was announced as the venue of the 2018 Final Four. AEK Athens, which qualified for the Final Four on 4 April, would serve as host. The arena was completed in 1995, and was the largest indoor venue in use for sporting events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. It is located in the Athens suburb of Marousi. It is considered to be one of the biggest and most modern indoor sports arenas in all of Europe.
Draw.
The draw for the pairings for the Final Four was held on 12 April 2018.
Background.
MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg.
Ludwigsburg qualified for its first ever final phase of a European competition, as in the 2016–17 season they were eliminated by Banvit on a buzzer-beater. In the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL), Riesen was having a solid year as it was battling for playoff position. In the BCL play-offs, Riesen eliminated two German sides, EWE Baskets Oldenburg and medi Bayreuth in order to advance to the final four.
Monaco.
Monaco was at the top of the standings in its domestic Pro A season. In February, Monaco won the Leaders Cup for its third consecutive time. In the previous season, the team also qualified for the Final Four but was eliminated in the semi-finals, by runners-up Banvit.
AEK Athens.
AEK was having a successful season as well, as the team captured its fourth Greek Cup title, while beating EuroLeague teams Olympiacos and Panathinaikos on the way. AEK had a remarkable path to the final four, as it was nearly eliminated in the round of 16 but was saved by a three-pointer by Kevin Punter to defeat Czech side ČEZ Nymburk. In the quarter-finals, AEK eliminated French side SIG Strasbourg. 
Guard Manny Harris was named the Basketball Champions League MVP as well.
UCAM Murcia.
In its first BCL season, and just its second year ever playing in European competitions, Murcia eliminated the defending champions Iberostar Tenerife in the round of 16. In the quarter-finals, Pınar Karşıyaka was defeated. In the 2017–18 ACB season, Murcia was close to qualifying to the playoffs.

Clematis Brook station

Clematis Brook was an MBTA Commuter Rail station in Waltham, Massachusetts. It served the Fitchburg Line, and was located in the Warrendale section of Waltham. It was closed in 1978 due to poor ridership.
History.
The Fitchburg Railroad was completed through Waltham in 1845. In 1881, it was joined by the Central Massachusetts Railroad, which paralleled it from west of Beaver Street to the Fitchburg Cutoff. Both railroads had Clematis Brook stations located on the east side of Beaver Street. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) gained control of the Central Massachusetts in 1887, followed by the Fitchburg in 1900. By 1904, Clematis Brook was served by a single station between the two lines; similar consolidation of nearby Waverley, Belmont, and Hill Crossing came later.
In 1952, the B&amp;M abandoned the duplicate Central Mass tracks during a grade separation project at Waverley. After the track consolidation, the Central Mass Branch diverged from the Fitchburg mainline just west of Clematis Brook. By the time the MBTA began subsidizing service in 1965, Clematis Brook was no longer served by the single Central Mass Branch round trip (which was discontinued in 1971). Like nearby Beaver Brook station, Clematis Brook was only served by a handful of rush hour trips. The two stations were closed in June 1978, along with Winchester Highlands station on the Lowell Line, due to poor ridership. No remains of the station are present.

Robo-Squad is an action-sports game for the Atari Lynx published by Atari Corporation in 1990.
Gameplay.
"Robo-Squad" is an action-sports game.
Synopsis.
The year is 2810 and the president has died leaving "the United World Federation in Chaos." In order solve the dispute you have been sent to compete for control of the planets and the domination of the galaxy in a friendly game of Robs-Squash.
Reception.
"Robo-Squash" was met with mostly positive reception. "Computer and Video Games" reviewed the game in their March 1991 issue giving it a score of 70 out of 100. Julian Boardman reviewed the game for "Raze" in their April 1991 issue. In his short notes he wrote that the game was "Addictive" with "engrossing gameplay" giving a score of 82%. Robert A. Jung reviewed the game which was published on IGN in 1999. In his review he went on to say "A good, slightly above-average game. Playing it by yourself is fine, since the difficulty levels let you tune the computer to your skills. I suspect, though, that playing it with another person would be more fun. Best for players who are looking for a sports-type game for the Lynx." This giving a final score of 7 out of 10.

BeLeave

BeLeave was a campaign group which campaigned for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum. The group was set up to focus on younger voters.
Background.
BeLeave was set up as a "youth-focused pro-Brexit campaign" by Darren Grimes, at the time a 22-year-old fashion student and part-time shop worker. Grimes was reported as working from Vote Leave's office and was invited to appear on several TV and radio programmes arguing for Britain to leave the EU. When Vote Leave was close to its £7m spending limit, Vote Leave emailed Grimes with offers of financial help, to which Grimes replied asking that the money be spent on Facebook ads to be placed by AggregateIQ. Vote Leave sent £675,000 in this way to AggregateIQ, without the money ever passing into the hands of Grimes or BeLeave. BeLeave had no significant income or expenditure apart from this.
BeLeave was described as a "Vote Leave Outreach Group" on the official Vote Leave webpage.
Referral to the Electoral Commission.
In March 2018 former BeLeave activist Shahmir Sanni claimed that BeLeave was used by Vote Leave to exceed legal spending limits.
It was claimed that Vote Leave, the official campaign in favour of leaving the European Union in the Referendum, illegally used BeLeave as a channel for a payment of £675,000 to AggregateIQ, a Canadian company which worked on pro-Brexit projects, requiring that BeLeave spent the money in this way. Vote Leave would have exceeded its campaign spending limit of £7m had it spent the money itself.
Electoral Commission findings.
On 17 July 2018, the Electoral Commission published the conclusions of its investigation into the campaign spending of Vote Leave and found that Vote Leave and Grimes had broken electoral law.
Vote Leave was fined £61,000. Grimes, representing BeLeave, was fined £20,000, the maximum permitted individual fine, for exceeding its spending limit as an unregistered campaigner by more than £660,000 and delivering an inaccurate and incomplete spending return.
High Court of Justice findings against the Electoral Commission and BeLeave.
On 14 September 2018, the High Court of Justice found against the Electoral Commission, stating that its advice to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes had been incorrect, but confirming that the overspending had been illegal.
Appeals.
Vote Leave, which claimed they would not have paid BeLeave without the advice, initially appealed against their fine, but withdrew the appeal in March 2019.
Darren Grimes, who also began an appeal against his fine, did not withdraw in March 2019. On the 19th of July 2019, in the Central London County Court, Grimes successfully appealed the £20,000 fine levied for breaking electoral law in the lead up to the Brexit referendum, and the fine from the Electoral Commission was quashed. Judge Marc Dight said, "even if Grimes had committed the offence, it would not have justified the fine of £20,000, the maximum possible under current law." The Electoral Commission said: “We are disappointed that the court has upheld Mr Grimes’s appeal. We will now review the full detail of the judgment before deciding on next steps." In August 2019, the Electoral Commission decided not to appeal against the ruling.

Nivalenol

Nivalenol (NIV) is a mycotoxin of the trichothecene group. In nature it is mainly found in fungi of the "Fusarium" species. The "Fusarium" species belongs to the most prevalent mycotoxin producing fungi in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, therefore making them a considerable risk for the food crop production industry.
The fungi are abundant in various agricultural products (cereal crops) and their further processed products (malt, beer and bread). "The "Fusarium" species invade and grow on crops, and may produce nivalenol under moist and cool conditions".
The symptoms observed after being affected with nivalenol are "feed refusal, vomiting, gastroenteric and dermal irritation or necrosis and immunological dysfunction", as well as haematotoxicity, resulting in a low leukocyte count.
History.
In the period of 1946-1963 several cases of intoxication due to the ingestion of "Fusarium" infected grains (Scrabby grain disease) were reported in Japan, Korea and India. There have been no reports of lethal cases and only mild symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. In these incidents "F.graminaerum" could be isolated which hints at a nivalenol or deoxynivalenol contamination.
In the same period two outbreaks involving over 100 cases were reported in India and China. These outbreaks were also non-lethal.
A well documented and acute outbreak in India in 1987 affected around 50,000 thousand people. Several "Fusarium" toxins under which nivalenol (0.03–0.1 mg/kg in 2 of 24 samples), deoxynivalenol (0.34–8.4 mg/kg in 11 of 24 samples) and acetyldeoxynivalenol (0.6–2.4 mg/kg in 4 of 24 samples) were found in rain-damaged wheat used for bread production. There were again no lethal cases and reported symptoms were abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool and vomiting. These cases show that the main emerging danger of nivalenol comes from "Fusarium" infected cereals and is mainly via the route of digestion of uncontrolled wheat or other grains which is further processed or does enter the food chain via another route.
Weaponization and other instances of Nivalenol poisoning.
Nivalenol as well as deoxynivalenol and T-2 toxin have been used as biological warfare agents in Laos and Cambodia as well as in Afghanistan. The Soviet Union has been alleged to have provided the mycotoxins and to have used them themselves in Afghanistan. All three compounds could be identified in the vegetation at affected sites, whereas T-2 toxin could also be found in urine and blood samples of victims.
The best documented use of trichothecenes in warfare is the yellow rain controversy, this describes a number of attacks in Southeastern Asia as well as Laos and Afghanistan, which used a “yellow rain” as described by witnesses. The toxins were delivered as what has been described as a cloud of yellow dust or droplets. An article by L. R. Ember published in 1984 in Chemical Engineering News describes the use of trichothecene mycotoxins as biological weapons in Southeast Asia in a very detailed manner. In it reports of survivors and eyewitnesses as well as prisoners of war and soviet informants can be found together with information on the presence of soviet technicians and laboratories. This led to the conclusion that these toxins have been used in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan. The Russian government however refuses to give a statement on these pieces of evidence. Furthermore, it has been shown that samples taken on the location of attacks contain these toxins, while sites that have not been attacked do not show any signs of toxins in them.
Even though it remains questionable if all witness reports are reliable sources of evidence, the symptoms recorded are typical for intoxication with trichothecenes.
There was a number of ways in which trichothecenes were weaponized, such as dispersion as aerosol, smoke, droplets or dust from aircraft, missiles, handheld devices or artillery.
Safety guidelines in the food industry.
In 2000 a scientific opinion on nivalenol was issued by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). A temporary tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) of 0–0.7 µg/kg bw per day was issued after evaluation of the general toxicity as well as the haematoxicity and the immunotoxicity. This t-TDI was reaffirmed by the SCF in 2002.
In 2010 the Japanese Food Safety Commission (FSCJ) issued a t-TDI of 0.4 μg/kg bw per day.
Between 2001 and 2011 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) collected data from 15774 nivalenol occurrences in 18 European countries to be assessed. This led to the establishment of a TDI of 1.2 µg/kg bw per day. Nivalenol was in this studies not found to be genotoxic, but well haematotoxic and immunotoxic.
Structure and reactivity.
Nivalenol as part of the family of mycotoxins has the common structure which all members of this toxin family have. This includes the basic structure of a cyclohexene and a tetrahydropyran ring connected at C6 and C11. Additionally an ethyl-group connects the tetrahydropyran at C2 and C5 and a keto group is attached at the cyclohexene at C8. The epoxide group, responsible for the reactivity for most parts, is attached at C12 and C13 in the tetrahydropyran. Only the remaining groups at positions C3, C4, C7, C15 vary for the different mycotoxins. In case of nivalenol each of the four remaining groups is a substituted hydroxyl group which add up to the reactivity in presence of hydrophilic compounds or subgroups respectively thanks to their polar characteristics. In acidic medium the keto group is capable of reacting with a proton promoting polarity and reactivity as well. But altogether the epoxide group is crucial for the reactivity of the molecule.
Available forms.
Nivalenol, deoxynivalenol and T2-toxin are the three structural and similar synthesized mycotoxins naturally appearing in fungi (e.g. "Fusarium").
Synthesis.
The synthesis of nivalenol is a 16 step process. It can differ in step 11 to step 14 depending on the order in which the reaction controlling trichodiene synthases TRI1, TRI13 and TRI7 are catalyzing. Famesyl pyrophosphate is used as starting compound for the synthesis of nivalenol. Its cyclization reaction to trichodiene is catalyzed by terpene cyclase trichodiene synthase (Tri5). This reaction is followed by several oxidation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (encoded by TRI4). Thereby hydroxyl groups were substituted to the carbon atoms C2, C3 and C11 and one oxygen was added to C12 and C13 facilitating the formation of an epoxide group. This results in the intermediate isotrichotriol.
In a further reaction trichotriol was gained through a shift of the C11 hydroxyl group of the isotrichotriol to the C9, similar the double bond shifted from C9=C10 to C10=C11. Trichotriol reacts in a non-enzymatic cyclization reaction to its isomere isotrichodermol. In the reaction the hydroxyl group on the C2 of the cyclopentane binds to the C11 of the cyclohexene forming a tetrahydropyran ring. The shifted OH-group at C9 is lost during the reaction. An acetyltransferase (encoded by TRI101) catalyzes the acetylation of the C3 OH-group of isotrichodermol forming isotrichdermin.
Isotrichodermin is converted to 15-decalonecitrin due to a substitution (encoded by TRI11) of one hydrogen by one hydroxyl at C15 which is then acetylated under help of TRI3. The same substitution and following acetylation reactions occur at C4 again under the control of TRI13 and TRI7. TRI1 in "F.sporotrichiodies" further catalyzes the addition of a fourth OH-group at C8 and a fifth OH-group at C7 at which then the hydrogen is eliminated and a keto group forms.
In a last step an esterase controlled by TRI8 catalyzes the deacetylation at C3, C4 and C15 resulting in the end product nivalenol. A partly alternative synthesis can occur when the catalysts TRI1 and TRI13, TRI7 are used in opposite order. Then the addition of the hydroxyl groups at C7 and C8 controlled by TRI1 are happening with calonectrin as reactant. In this reaction 7,8-dihydroxycalonectrin is formed. It further reacts spontaneously to 3,15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol via elimination of a hydrogen and formation of a keto-group at C8. The addition of a hydroxyl group at C4 controlled by TRI13 occurs and is acetylated under the help of TRI7. This yields 3,4,15-triacetylnivalenol (3,4,15-triANIV) from which it is than again the same synthesis as described above.
Mechanism of action.
Nivalenol causes a change in a number of different biological pathways. The most well known and probably important, is the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is a transcription factor that can be found in almost all human cells, and regulates the expression of its target genes by binding to specific motifs on the genomic DNA on regulatory elements. "In vitro" tests have shown, that nivalenol can change the expression of cytokines, which are important controller molecules of the immune system. Nivalenol induced the secretion of IL-8, a mediator of inflammation. When treated with an NF-κB inhibitor, IL-8 secretion was lowered. Another important factor influenced by nivalenol is MCP-1/CCL2, this cytokine plays a role in the mobility regulation of mononuclear leukocyte cells. Nivalenol causes CCL2 secretion to be lowered, and thus the mobility of monocytes to be reduced. This explains part of the immunosuppressive nature of nivalenol. Again, this effect is reduced by NF-κB inhibition which shows, that nivalenol and NF-κB interact to influence the cell.
It was shown that while deoxynivalenol induces the secretion of chemokines, which are also immunorelevant messenger molecules, nivalenol does inhibit their secretion. Nivalenol also upregulates the expression of proinflammatory genes in macrophages, displaying a mixed effect on different cell types. It does so even at cytotoxic levels.
Another mechanism of cytotoxicity of nivalenol is the apoptotic cytotoxicity showing that nivalenol is more toxic than its often co-occurring mycotoxin partner deoxynivalenol, and does so by causing DNA damage and apoptosis. Nivalenol is also known to influence human leukocyte proliferation. It has been shown that nivalenol can change proliferation rates of human leukocytes in a dose dependent manner. Lower concentrations are known to enhance leukocyte proliferation, while higher concentrations decrease proliferation in a dose dependent manner.
Metabolism.
Nivalenol in mice is not only metabolized through the liver but also, for a lesser part through microbial detoxification in the intestines. Thereby especially the epoxide group as most toxic part of the molecule is degraded. This happens by eliminating the oxygen of the epoxide group resulting in a double carbon-carbon bond between C12 and C13. This double bond is nonpolar and very stable leading to a less reactive form of nivalenol called de-epoxynivalenol. The de-epoxinated nivalenol gained is therefore much less toxic, same as every de-epoxinated trichodiene, and can be segregated into the urine without having much toxic effects anymore (nearly non-toxic).
In the urine of tested mice and pigs 80% of the de-epoxidated compound and only 7% of the actual nivalenol were found showing a high metabolising rate of the trichodienes. Thereby a low concentration of nitrogen in low proteins and urea were observed whereas the cholesterol concentration was observed to be higher than normal. This suggests that nivalenol is present and later degraded in the liver as the liver is responsible for the segregation of cholesterol into the bloodstream. The higher amount of cholesterol in the blood leads then to a higher amount of filtered cholesterol by the kidneys and eventually to an increased concentration in the urea.
The lowered concentration of amides is assumed to be caused in the degradation process of the reactive epoxide group. Therefore, the epoxides are often found to react with amides or amide groups by adding a hydroxyl group at a primary or secondary amine. As a consequence the epoxide group is degraded and less nitrogen is present for the synthesis of proteins or urea.
Adverse effects.
Nivalenol did not yet find usage in medical treatments, and therefore it does not have known adverse effects besides the toxic effects described. It is however worth noting that it could be interesting for investigation due to its immunosuppressive effects.
Effects on animals and Efficacy.
As nivalenol is a mycotoxic product of certain "Fusarium" species it is often found in infected wheat and grain. As unprocessed wheat and grain product are often used as feed for livestock animals these are at a higher risk of nivalenol intake.
Toxicity studies in swine that received a dose of 0.05 mg nivalenol/kg body weight twice daily showed no lethal effects. Most nivalenol was secreted with the feces and did not reach the bloodstream despite the fact that there was still nivalenol upstage over the intestines after 16 hours of feeding. There were further no nivalenol metabolites found in feces or urine within the first three days. After a week of exposure to 2.5 or 5 mg nivalenol kg bw twice a day a microbiological adaptation was seen as nivalenol metabolites (de-epoxidated nivalenol) could be found in feces and urine.
In rats and mice nivalenol showed to be toxic with adverse effects of growth retardation and leukopenia already noticed at lowest doses of 0.7 mg/kg bw per day. Lethal doses were dependent on the route of administration/intake of nivalenol. As nivalenol is normally taken up with feed the LD50 of oral administration which is 38.9 mg/kg bw per day in mice and 19.5 mg/kg bw per day in rats can be used as standard. The LD50 of intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous (SC) is between 7 and 7.5 mg/kg bw per day.
Toxicity, indications and side effects.
The toxicity of nivalenol in humans is for the most parts unknown yet, but it was investigated in mice, rats and hamster cells. Thereby the toxicity was divided in the following topics: acute/subacute, subchronic, chronic and carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity studies and studies on reproduction, immunotoxicity/hematotoxycity and effects on nervous system.
Acute/subacute toxicity.
The oral LD50 of nivalenol was found to be 38.9 mg/kg bw in mice whereas the intraperitonal, subcutaneous and intravenous routes of exposure gave LD50 values of 5–10 mg/kg bw. In mice already within 3 days the most deaths occurred after oral exposure through marked congestion and haemorrhage in intestine, in acute toxicity also lymphoid organs are included. Nivalenol given over time periods of 24 days in lower doses (ca. 3,5 mg/kg bw) showed significant erythropenia and slight leukopenia.
Subchronic toxicity.
The subchronic toxicity was tested by feeding mice with a daily dose of 0 to 3.5 mg nivalenol/ kg bw for 4 or 12 weeks. The observations after 4 weeks were reduced body weight and food consumption. The reduction in body weight can be explained by statistical decrease in organ weight in thymus, spleen and kidneys. Whereas the consumption time was less for female mice in comparison to male mice. After 12 weeks the toxin consumption resulted in reduction of relative organ weight in both males and females. Hereby only the liver was affected and no histopathological changes were observed.
Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity.
Female mice were fed with different doses of nivalenol (0, 0.7, 1.4 or 3.5 mg nivalenol /kg bw) for one or two years to investigate whether nivalenol is chronic toxic and/or carcinogenic. Also during this study a decrease in body weight and feed consumption was observed. The absolute weight of both liver and kidney was decreased through the two highest doses. The mice fed for one year with nivalenol (also with the lower doses) were affected with severe leukopenia whereas the mice fed for two years had no differences in count of white blood cells. Also "no histopathological changes including tumours were found in liver, thymus, spleen, kidneys, stomach, adrenal glands, pituitary glands, ovaries, bone marrow, lymph node, brain and small intestines with or without Peyer's patch". The lowest doses (0.7 mg nivalenol /kg bw) inhibited the growth and caused leukopenia. "A no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be derived from these studies. IARC (1993) concluded that there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity of nivalenol in experimental animals. No human data were available. The overall conclusion was that the carcinogenicity was not classifiable (group 3)".
Genotoxicity.
It was found that nivalenol effects the genes of Chinese hamster V79 (CHO) cells by slightly increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange. The DNA was damaged in CHO cells as well as in mice. In mice (given 20 mg nivalenol /kg bw orally or 3.7 mg /kg bw ip) the DNA of kidney, bone marrow, stomach, jejunum and colon was damaged. The DNA of the thymus and liver was not effected. In organs with DNA damage no necrotic changes were found upon histopathological examination. It can be concluded that an adequate evaluation of the genotoxicity is not allowed based on the available data.
Developmental toxicity and studies on reproduction.
For developmental and reproduction studies pregnant mice were injected with different amounts of purified nivalenol on days 7–15 of gestation and for one additional study with mouldy rice containing nivalenol. The studies showed that the toxin is embryotoxic in mice. No evidence of teratogenicity was given. "The LOAEL in reproduction studies with nivalenol given by oral exposure was stated to be 1.4 mg/kg bw given in the feed throughout gestation and 5 mg/kg bw when given by gavage on days 7–15". Data from other species and on reproductive effects in adult males and females are not provided yet.
Immunotoxicity/haematotoxicity.
Acute toxicity of nivalenol induces bone marrow toxicity and toxicity of lymphoid organs. Long-term exposure may result in erythropenia and/or leukopenia. In mice it was also observed that nivalenol increased the presence of serum IgA, "accompanied by immunopathological changes in kidneys analogous to human IgA-nephropathy". The blastogenesis in cultured human lymphocytes, proliferation of human male and female lymphocytes stimulated with phytoheamagglutin and pokeweed and immunoglobulin production induced by pokeweed, are inhibited by nivalenol. The effects of nivalenol are in the same range as same doses of deoxynivalenol, whereas the T-2 toxin are 100 fold more toxic. An additive effect is gained by combination of nivalenol with T-2 toxin, 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol or deoxynivalenol.
Effects on nervous system.
About the nervous system no data has been provided yet.

An Wasserflüssen Babylon (Reincken)

An Wasserflüssen Babylon is a chorale fantasia for organ by Johann Adam Reincken, based on "An Wasserflüssen Babylon", a 16th-century Lutheran hymn by Wolfgang Dachstein. Reincken likely composed the fantasia in 1663, partly as a tribute to Heinrich Scheidemann, his tutor and predecessor as organist at St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg. With its 327 bars, it is the most extended repertoire piece of this kind. Reincken's setting is a significant representative of the north German style of organ music.
History.
The text of Wolfgang Dachstein's "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" (By the Rivers of Babylon) is a paraphrase of Psalm 137 (), Jews lamenting their Babylonian captivity. Its hymn tune is in bar form:
The hymn was published in 1525, and was adopted in several major German hymnals by 1740.
Heinrich Scheidemann can be considered the inventor of the chorale fantasia for organ, and, based on over fifteen attributable compositions, the most prolific contributor to this genre. It was an expansion of the Fantasia genre as developed by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck. Around the mid-1650s Reincken was, probably in about the same period as Dieterich Buxtehude, Scheidemann's pupil for a few years, after which he returned to the Netherlands. Called back by his former teacher in 1659, he became his assistant as organist at the St. Catherine's Church in Hamburg. Around 1660 the stylus fantasticus was the dominant style among the organists in Hamburg, of which the chorale fantasias by both Reincken and Buxtehude bear the mark.
In 1663 Scheidemann died and Reincken succeeded him as organist of the St. Catherine's Church. "Allein zu dir", a late chorale fantasia by Scheidemann, shares many characteristics with Reincken's "An Wasserflüssen Babylon", so it is assumed that Reincken composed his setting around the same time, as masterpiece to conclude his schooling, or, most likely, when he assumed his position as successor of Scheidemann at St. Catherine's. Reincken's chorale setting appears not to have been intended for liturgical use, neither as a prelude to a sung chorale, nor for alternatim performance, but rather as a model for improvisation, showing several techniques.
Music.
In his "An Wasserflüssen Babylon", Reincken covers all of the techniques of the chorale fantasia: , fugue, echo, figurative writing, and embellished chorale. The composition presents itself as a compendium of the north German style of organ music. The verses of Dachstein's chorale are in ten lines. Lines three and four are sung to the same melody as the first two lines, which is the of the chorale tune, thus lines one and two can be indicated as first , and the next two lines as repeat of the . Following Sweelinck's scheme for a fantasia, Reincken's "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" has three sections, "Exordium" (exposition), "Medium" (middle section) and "Finis" (finale):
Bars 1–107.
In the "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" hymn, the is the tune for two lines of text, here represented by two bars:
&lt;score sound="1"&gt;
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 2=72
\set Staff.midiInstrument = "english horn"
\override Score.TimeSignature #'transparent = ##t 
\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t
\time 6/2
c"2 d"4 c" a'2 c" bes'4 bes' a'2
g'2 a'4 bes' c"2 bes'4 a' g'2 f'
&lt;/score&gt;
First "Stollen".
The first two lines of the hymn text, or the first , are the subject of the first 81 bars of Reincken's chorale fantasia. The melody of the first line of the hymn is recognisable as a cantus firmus in the tenor voice in the first six bars of the composition:
The first section develops as a monody (played by the right hand) over a fugal setting, which is a technique typical of Scheidemann's chorale preludes. Thus, according to , this first episode can be seen as Reincken's tribute to Scheidemann.
The two lines are each treated with a dense counterpoint, which is similar for both lines. Over-all the figuration recedes in favour of a motet-like polyphony.
Repeat of the "Stollen".
The repeat of the , lines three and four of the hymn text, follows in bars 82 to 107. The repeat of the is shorter than the first , and introduces an element of virtuosity. In the third line the left hand plays, with imaginative embellishments in the tenor voice, up to the highest notes on the keyboard, while the fourth line is characterised by ornamentation of the treble voice.
Bars 108–235.
Lines five to eight of the hymn tune have this melody, each line represented by a bar:
&lt;score sound="1"&gt;
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 2=72
\set Staff.midiInstrument = "english horn"
\override Score.TimeSignature #'transparent = ##t 
\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t

a'2 c"4 d" c" a' bes'2 a'
\time 7/2
d"2 d"4 d" g'2 c" bes'4( g') a'2 g'
&lt;/score&gt;
With its 128 bars this is the most extended section of the chorale fantasia, and treats, consecutively, lines five to eight of the chorale. The section has a symmetrical build: the outer episodes (lines five and eight) both elaborate a similar -like theme, and the central episodes (lines six and seven) both have dotted rhythms and use the echo technique.
Bars 236–327.
Although the last section of the chorale fantasia elaborates only the remaining two lines of the "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" hymn, it is nonetheless in four episodes, like the preceding section.
Ninth line.
The penultimate line of the chorale tune,
&lt;score sound="1"&gt;
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 2=72
\set Staff.midiInstrument = "english horn"
\override Score.TimeSignature #'transparent = ##t 
\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t
\time 7/2
bes'2 a'4 g' f'2 g' e'4 (f') d'2 c'
&lt;/score&gt;
is elaborated twice in bars 236–290:
Tenth line.
The last line of the chorale tune,
&lt;score sound="1"&gt;
\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
\tempo 2=72
\set Staff.midiInstrument = "english horn"
\override Score.TimeSignature #'transparent = ##t 
\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t
\time 8/2 
c'2 f'4 g' a' bes' c"2(a'4 bes' g'2) f'1
&lt;/score&gt;
is, from bar 291, first treated in a dialogue-like echo setting, followed by an extended virtuoso coda which also uses the echo technique. These final passages of the chorale fantasia, starting with fast melody lines in both hands imitating each other almost as a canon, are very close to how Scheidemann's "Allein zu dir" ends.
The end of the coda,
shows an unusual gesture: the melody line descends in a scale to the end note.
Reception.
According to an anecdote in Johann Gottfried Walther's "Musicalisches Lexikon" (1732), Reincken sent a copy of his "An Wasserflüssen Babylon", as a portrait of himself, to a great musician in Amsterdam who had commented on his recklessness to succeed such a famous man as Scheidemann. This copy is lost: a copy of the work surviving in Amsterdam was sent there in the 19th century, based on a Berlin manuscript.
As reported in his obituary, published in 1754, Johann Sebastian Bach knew Reincken's "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" chorale setting. Two and a half centuries later it became clear that Bach had known the piece since he was a teenager. When he was studying in northern Germany in the early 18th century, Bach visited Hamburg several times to hear Reincken play. The earliest known versions of Bach's organ setting of Dachstein's hymn, BWV 653b and 653a, originated in his Weimar period (1708–1717). In the early 1720s Bach improvised for nearly half an hour on "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" at the organ of St. Catherine's Church in Hamburg, a performance which was attended by the ageing Reincken. When the concert was concluded, Reincken commended Bach for this improvisation: "I thought this art was dead, but I see that it survives in you." In the second half of the 1740s, Bach reworked his "An Wasserflüssen Babylon" chorale prelude to the BWV 653 version included in the "Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes", adding a seven-bar coda:
This coda ends with a descending scale reminiscent of the one that ends Reincken's setting (see above): Russell Stinson interprets this as a musical homage to Reincken. He writes, "It is hard not to believe that this correspondence represents an act of homage." Despite being composed in Leipzig within the traditions of Thuringia, however, Bach's contemplative "mesmerising" mood is far removed from his earlier improvisatory compositions in Hamburg and Reincken's chorale fantasia: the later chorale prelude is understated, with its cantus firmus subtly embellished.
In the first part of his Bach biography, published in 1873, Philipp Spitta recognises that Reincken's chorale fantasia received some extra lustre through the anecdote involving Bach, adding that it is nonetheless a work worth to be considered in its own right. Writing in the next decade, August Gottfried Ritter is less favourable about the composition, describing its artificiality as disconnected from liturgical praxis.
Score editions.
In 1974 Breitkopf &amp; Härtel published Reincken's organ works, including "An Wasserflüssen Babylon", edited by . Two extant copies of Reincken's composition were known at the time of publication, both of them deriving from the lost Berlin manuscript. Beckmann's edition of the work for Schott was published in 2004. Pieter Dirksen provided a new edition for Breitkopf: in the preface of this 2005 publication he describes the chorale fantasia as being transmitted via a single source.
Around 2006 Michael Maul and Peter Wollny recovered the "Weimarer Orgeltabulatur", containing a previously unknown organ tablature version of Reincken's "An Wasserflüssen Babylon". This copy of the chorale fantasia had originated in the late 17th century in the circles of Georg Böhm: an endnote on the manuscript, in Johann Sebastian Bach's hand, dates it to 1700. After having published a facsimile of this manuscript in 2007, Maul and Wollny published an edited score of the same in 2008.

Trent Schroyer

Trent Schroyer (May 23, 1936 – December 4, 2018) was an American scholar, author and international activist.
Schroyer's first book "The Critique of Domination: The Origins and Development of Critical Theory" was nominated for a National Book Award. Schroyer was active in interpreting critical theory to many colleges and universities. Later teaching at Ramapo College of N.J., Schroyer focused on promoting sustainability. As chair of The Other Economic Summit (TOES), Schroyer was an international organizer and writer about neoliberal globalization and its alternatives. Later organizing trips to South India and the Aegean islands, he focused on regenerative alternatives to westernizing development and resistance to authoritarianism.
Origins and personal life.
Schroyer grew up on a farm in Wolfsville, Maryland. As a boy scout, he became a naturalist. In college, Schroyer guided wilderness trips and nature tours as a part-time job.
Education.
Schroyer studied physics and geology at Antioch College in Ohio and was a co-op worker at the General Motors Institute. Serving as a lab assistant to C.F. Kettering, Schroyer was impressed by Kettering's view that overly literal theory was a detriment to contextual innovations.
During his junior of college, Schroyer studied physics and philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. In 1959, he graduated from Antioch College with a degree in philosophy.
Graduate work.
After graduating from Antioch, Schroyer received a fellowship to study philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, where e became interested in the study of philosophies of history.
He received his doctorate from the New School. His dissertation "Alienation and the Dialectical Paradigm" focused on the historical creation of a critical science and philosophy.
Teaching career.
In 1969, Schroyer was asked to join the graduate faculty of the New School, where he taught critical theory. During this time, he published "The Critique of Domination: The Origins and Development of Critical Theory" that was nominated for a National Book Award in philosophy and religion.
As editor of the journal "Telos", Schroyer helped get critical theory diffused more broadly. But after an extended research in the spin offs of the New Left, the editorial board declined to open a new communications section documenting these innovations – Schroyer dropped out of the journal.
In 1973, Schroyer was appointed professor of sociology-philosophy in the School of Environmental Studies at Ramapo College. Schroyer organized six semester-long lecture series at Ramapo college on the subjects of "Ecological Futures," "Counter Movements in Science," "Authoritarianism or Democratization," "Thinking Globally - Acting Locally, Promises of the Earth Summit," and "World Sustainability," as well as a later symposium on "The Relevance of Gandhi After 9/11."
TOES (The Other Economic Summit).
In 1990, Schroyer served as the overall program coordinator for "The Other Economic Summit" (TOES) in Houston, Texas in 1990. In 1997, he replaced Ward Morehouse as chair for Denver, Colorado. After the G-7 meeting in Denver, Schroyer helped form with Stephen Marglin an Economic Visions group at TOES. Schroyer again served as chair at the 2004 Brunswick summit.
Publications.
Schroyer's books include critical discourse of corporate sustainable development and documentation of real sustainability practices. His work also documents the regenerations of intrinsic capacities of unique ecologies and cultures.
In "The History of Scarcity: Consequences and Planetary Costs of Globalization", Schroyer adopted an alternative interpretation of these historical realities from Karl Polanyi's critique of Karl Marx's theory of the source of human misery. Polanyi asserts that "The disintegration of the cultural environment of the victim is the cause of degradation, not economic exploitation" ("The Great Transformation"). Undermining socio-cultural institutions subordinates them to the logics of wider market forces. Of course, economic exploitation exists and the powerful will impose it. Polanyi derives this hypothesis from his analysis of how the new social technologies of classical economics were applied to aggressively destroy subsistence capacities in England and the colonies. Once the concept of scarcity is central to economic theory it becomes much easier to imagine the human situation as dependent upon "nature-like" economic forces and to impose wider wage-labor regimes upon livelihood centered habitation.
Ivan Illich uses Polanyi's view to form a prophetic hypothesis about the history of the west as a 500-year war on subsistence - the history of scarcity. Scarcity is the condition that justifies the dis-valuing of all traditional socio-cultural forms. The hierarchies and hollowing out of political capacities and creation of social scarcity results in the collapse of social bonds that create loneliness and isolation. This also applies to the conditions leading to the 2016 U.S. election.
As a participant in Ivan Illich's retreats in Germany, Penn State, and Oakland, Calif. that focused on dimensions of the history of scarcity Schroyer benefited from the wisdom of Wolfgang Sachs, David Cayley, Frederique Apffel-Marglin, Jean Robert, et al.
Discovery and discourse in India.
As a member of International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, a non-governmental, international solidarity organization based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Schroyer helped facilitate gatherings of indigenous leaders in Quebec and south-east Asia. At the Bangalore, India conference in 2000, Siddhartha, from Fireflies Ashram, invited him to bring activists, scholars and students to India to encounter grassroots actions and models for alternatives in south India. From this beginning in 2000 Schroyer founded the Ramapo India semester study abroad program. In 2004 Schroyer brought Ramapo students and activists to the World Social Forum in Mumbai, built around the slogan 'Another World is Possible'.
At Fireflies Ashram, participants engaged in public dialogues about transformative innovations in India such as the ongoing Gandhian legacy, commons actions, alternative economics and inter-religious discourse. Participation in these discourses and visits to many communities revealed that encountering people in their own worlds changes perceptions and structures of feeling. These encounters were expressed in the following presentations:
Schroyer gave a talk titled "On Economic Alternatives" to the Indian Institute of Journalism &amp; News Media (IIJNM), Bangalore, India in 2008 and another talk to the Indian Institute of Science Campus in Bangalore that same year, titled "The Fall of Western Certitudes and the Relevance of Ivan Illich". On March 31,2009, Schroyer presented a paper "Compassion and Confrontation" at the University of Madras, Chennai, India.
Re-inhabitations on Ikaria Island, Greece.
Tula Tsalis and Schroyer led three summer trips with students and activists down the Aegean islands from Lesvos, to Chios, to Samos, Ikaria and Patmos going from units of the University of the Aegean for introductions to Greek history and the problems of the islands. This was a background for work in Ikaria.
Schroyer and his wife, Tula Tsalis, helped start an Ikarian Regeneration Project as a response to the imposed "austerity" programs on Greece and Ikaria island and investigated how Ikarian's can protect their public assets (‘commons’), such as forests, water systems, and community solidarity. Realities of the island were interpreted in their participation in the International Commons Conference at the Heinrich Boll Foundation in Berlin Germany (2010) and Schroyer's paper 'Beyond Western Economism' presented at the European Urban Anthropology Conference at the University of Peloponnese in Corinth, Greece (2010).
Participation in civic education in America.
The 2009 Economics of Peace International Conference co-convened by the Praxis Peace Institute in Sonoma, California included Schroyer's participation. 
Pope Francis proposed worldwide dialogues about the credibility of the progress narratives and advocates putting scientific knowledge and techno-economic development into the context of a wider Integral ecology. Schroyer joined this discourse in Ramapo College's Symposium on Pope Francis's Laudato Si whose discourse is convergent with some of Ivan IIlich's views. (2015)
Schroyer helped create the Community Action Network in Warwick, NY in November 2016 in response to Donald Trump's policies.
The forum on "Can We Save the Constitution or Can the Constitution Save Us" in Middletown, N.Y. in 2017 was convened to assess threats to the United States Constitution. The forum argued that citizens should be prepared for a constitutional crisis.

Lellia Cracco Ruggini

Lellia Cracco Ruggini (20 September 1931 – 27 June 2021) was an Italian historian of Late Antiquity and professor emerita of the University of Turin. Her particular interests were in economic and social history, the history of ideas, and modern and ancient historiography. She specialized in the period from the second to seventh centuries AD.
Early life and education.
She was born at Milan on 20 September 1931. In 1954 she graduated from the University of Pavia with a degree in literature and was awarded a PhD in 1963 by the University of Turin.
Career.
From 1957 to 1968 she taught Greek and Roman history at the University of Pavia, becoming "Libera Docente" of Roman history and Latin epigraphy in 1963. She was Professor of Latin epigraphy at Pavia from 1965 to 1967.

Hive tool

A hive tool is a handheld multipurpose tool used in maintaining and inspecting beehives. Hive tools come in multiple variants and styles, and is intended as an all-in-one tool for beekeepers.
The hive tool is the third most essential tool for the beekeeper after the beekeeping veil and bee smoker. There are two types of hive tool in common use - the standard hive tool and J-type hive tool.
The standard hive tool has a box levering edge and a frame levering edge. The J-type hive tool also has a box levering edge, but on the other side is a j-hook and a small notch. Either type may have a small possibly tapered hole which is intended for removing small nails like a claw hammer. The other job of the hive tool is to lift frames when the hive is propolized. A J-type tool should be used in a specific way – the J goes into the bee space and the notch rests on the hive wall or the frame behind to provide lift. It is recommended not to use the J-hook under the lugs of the frames – it will not fit and may break the lugs off the frame.
Using an ordinary chisel or screwdriver instead may result in damage to equipment or to the beehive. Because an ordinary tool may cause excessive damage, it might not be worth the trouble when using these tools to inspect the hive. This is especially true in the case where a beekeeper is using these tools directly to manipulate materials.
Uses.
The hive tool is mainly used for two things:
The beekeeper will use it throughout hive inspections. Here are some uses:
Variants.
Standard.
The standard hive tool is made of a piece of plate metal bent at 90°.
J-Hook.
The J-Hook variant describes any type of hive tool that utilizes a curved hook at either end. The hook is in the same plane as the prying part and is thus, normally flat. The hook is used primarily for prying the hive frames loose while reducing potential damage done to both the frame and comb. It is traditionally a flat tool.
Frame Grip.
Operating very similarly to a pair of pliers, the frame grip can act as an alternative to a J-hook hive tool. Commonly used on more aggressive hives, the frame grip hive tool allows quick and efficient inspection of the hive frames. It can alternatively be used as a nail puller.

Henry Farquharson

Henry Farquharson (1675 – 19 December 1739) was a teacher who pioneered the study of mathematics in Russia. He was recruited by Peter the Great, who sought to introduce Western ideas and technology into Russia. He moved to Moscow where he established a school and later established a naval academy in Saint Petersburg. Farquharson had a profound effect on the intellectual life of Russia, not only by introducing mathematical ideas but by helping to create the first generation of explorers, surveyors, cartographers and astronomers.
Early life.
Henry Farquharson was born around 1675 at Milton, Whitehouse in West Aberdeenshire, the son of John Farquharson. From 1691 he studied as Milne bursar at Marischal College in Aberdeen and by 1695 he was Liddel mathematical tutor there. In April 1698 he was introduced to the tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, probably by the Marquess of Carmarthen. The tsar was at this time on a tour of Europe to learn from Western ideas and technology. In particular he was interested in creating a modern Russian navy. Peter the Great recruited Farquharson for a new mathematics and navigation school that he planned to found in Moscow.
Moscow.
Farquharson sailed on the "Royal Transport" with Stephen Gwyn (d.1720) and Richard Grice (d.1709) and they arrived in Archangel by June 1698. After their arrival in Moscow they lived in the house of an English merchant Henry Crevett and tutored a few paying students whilst they waited for the tsar to follow through with his promises of patronage.
By January 1701 a government decree had established the Mathematics and Navigation School. By June the school moved to the Sukharev Tower, a repurposed city gate and a Moscow landmark until its demolition in the 1930s. The school taught arithmetic, trigonometry, navigation, astronomy and surveying. Within a few years there were 500 pupils at the school, and by 1715 1200 specialists are thought to have graduated from the school. The school also held music and amateur stage performances on holidays and Sundays. At first Farquharson lectured in Latin until he learned Russian. He belonged to the quasi-masonic Neptune Society which met in the Sukharev Tower and was headed by the tsar himself. The tsar was fascinated with astronomy and would correspond with Farquharson about eclipses, as well as supplying him with as many instruments and book as he requested. In addition to teaching, Farquharson also performed practical duties. He proposed a direct road from Moscow to the new city of Saint Petersburg via Novgorod and led the surveying work himself.
St Petersburg.
In 1715 Peter the Great founded the St Petersburg Naval Academy at Kilkin's House, on the site where the Winter Palace now stands. Farquharson was appointed senior professor of mathematics and although the academy had a president and director, he was in de facto charge of the institute. He created a broad curriculum including not only mathematics and navigation but drawing, fencing, artillery and fortification. In the ten years after its founding 215 cadets graduated from the academy, many went on to complete their training in foreign naval service.
Farquharson was connected to the European scientific elite. He corresponded with Leibniz and the Royal Society about Russia as well as scientific topics. He believed to have translated as many as 38 scientific works into Russian including Euclid's "Elements" and Henry Brigg's "Arithmetic logarithmica". Farquharson was also a talented cartographer, producing a bronze engraving of Mercator's map of America and led the creation of a hydrographic atlas of the Caspian Sea.
By the end of his life, Farquharson had reached the level of brigadier in the Russian table of ranks, a sign of the high respect in which he was held. He died in St. Petersburg on 19 December 1739 and was probably buried in St. Sampson's cemetery.

Lonicera similis is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to Western China. This honeysuckle is known in cultivation by the variety "delavayi" (the Delavay honeysuckle) which is reported by some authorities to be synonymous with "L. similis" itself. It is a large, twining, semi-evergreen shrub growing to tall by broad, with a profusion of fragrant tubular flowers opening white and ageing to yellow, in late summer and autumn. The flowers are followed by black berries. The Latin specific epithet "similis" means “similar to”. It is similar in appearance to "L. japonica", but larger and more robust. The name "delavayi" honours the French missionary and botanist Père Jean Marie Delavay (1834-1895).
"Lonicera similis" var. "delavayi" is hardy down to . It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

Ponerorchis physoceras is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-west and west Sichuan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1924 by Rudolf Schlechter, as " Amitostigma physoceras". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis physoceras".

Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy

Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) is a 1985 Czech text adventure game for Sinclair ZX Spectrum computers and compatible hardware. It was authored by František Fuka. Two sequels were later produced entitled Indiana Jones II (1987) and Indiana Jones III (1990). The trilogy was later released in 1992 by Proxima Software as part of the Fuxoft brand "Fuxoft uvádí".
A continuation of the series was seen with the 1990 release of "Indiana Jones a zlatá soška Keltů", programmed by Jiří Fencl. Fencl also wrote a text adventure named "Tom Jones". Due to the series' success, the games were ported to other eight-bit home microcomputers by various authors, sometimes containing only text and sometimes with graphics.
Production.
František Fuka created Poklad and Poklad 2 in the early 1980s, and these served as a warmup before the designer began making more sophisticated games;
his first major project was "Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy". He invented the game during a holiday in Romania, despite him not having seen the movie it was based on. "Indiana Jones II" was released as a free sequel in 1987. It was notable for allowing the player to control the menu, which despite slow rendering and item selection was exceptional for the industry. Fuka promoted the title as "the first Czech text game with only three buttons". "Indiana Jones III" was notable for using a non-standard font upon its release in 1990, which allowed František Fuka to circumvent the display limitations of thirty-two characters per line. The title contained eight spaces for game saves, which was above that of foreign commercial products.
Plot and gameplay.
The three games are video game adaptions of the first three Indiana Jones films. They play as text adventure games controlled by keyboard commands. There are over 30 locations in "Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy", and the player can die in ten of them.
Reception.
Root.cz deemed "Indiana Jones II" easier than the first title, and deemed "Indiana Jones III" the best of the trilogy.
Textovky.cz deemed František Fuka a legend within the Czech video gaming industry, and noted that the Indiana Jones trilogy includes three of the five games that gave him this status.

Doyle Hamm

Doyle Lee Hamm (born February 14, 1957) is a former Alabama death row inmate, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of Patrick Cunningham. While on death row, Hamm developed lymphatic cancer, which made it difficult to impossible to achieve the venous access necessary to administer the drugs used in lethal injections. Despite months of warning by Hamm's attorney and human rights observers and a decades' long legal battle, the Alabama Department of Corrections attempted to execute Hamm on February 22, 2018. The unsuccessful execution attempt lasted nearly three hours and drew international attention. In March 2018, Hamm and the state of Alabama reached a confidential settlement, the terms of which preclude a second execution attempt, giving Hamm a de facto sentence of life in prison.
Early life.
Doyle Hamm grew up in northwest Alabama and was the tenth of twelve children. While he was growing up, Hamm's father and each of his six older brothers spent time in jail. In an interview, one of Hamm's sisters described their childhood home as “constant hell all the time” and recalled that her father told his children that “If you don’t go out and steal, then you’re not a Hamm.” From an early age, Hamm struggled in school. Tests and report cards indicated that, in the fifth grade, Hamm was still reading in at a first-grade level. Hamm dropped out of school during the ninth grade and began abusing drugs and alcohol.
At the age of twenty, Hamm was arrested and charged with robbery after a drunken fight in a bar parking lot. Hamm entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to five years in prison. Years later, the alleged victim confessed that no robbery had ever taken place and Hamm's court-appointed attorney admitted that he had been “too busy and overworked to give this case the time and attention it needed.” Hamm was arrested other times for burglary, assault, and grand larceny.
Capital murder.
On January 24, 1987, Hamm went on a crime spree that culminated in a motel robbery at the Anderson Motel in Cullman, Alabama and the murder of Patrick Cunningham, a nighttime clerk at the motel. $350 was taken from the motel's cash register as well as $60 from Cunningham’s wallet. Cunningham was shot once in the temple with a .38 caliber pistol that had been stolen in a robbery committed by Hamm in Mississippi earlier the same day. On The following day, January 25, 1987 Hamm was arrested in Cullman and charged with capital murder.
Two individuals claiming to be witnesses to the crime initially identified Hamm as the gunman during the robbery, but soon recanted their testimony. Those individuals were later charged as co-defendants and took deals to testify as state witnesses. During questioning, Hamm confessed to committing the robbery.
Problems at trial and on appeal.
Problems at trial.
Hamm's 1987 trial was divided into two parts: a first stage during which a jury would determine whether Hamm was guilty and, if it found him guilty, a second phase during which the jury would determine whether life imprisonment or a death sentence was the appropriate punishment. During the second phase of the trial, defense attorneys are able to present mitigating evidence to the jury, in order to argue that the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death.
Hamm's defense attorney spent only 19 minutes presenting mitigation evidence. None of the medical and education records indicating that Hamm may have had brain damage or an intellectual disability were presented to the jury, even though the records were available. Additionally, evidence that Hamm suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and that he had an IQ of only 66 was not presented to the jury. The defense counsel's failure to present this evidence to the jury became the subject of subsequent appeals, which raised the possibility that Hamm's attorney was so ineffective as to violate the Sixth Amendment.
Problems on appeal and in post-conviction proceedings.
In June 1999, twelve years after Hamm's conviction, Hamm received a hearing to review claims that his trial counsel was ineffective and that Hamm's constitutional right to counsel was violated as a result. On Friday December 3, the Alabama Attorney General's office submitted a “Proposed Memorandum Order” to the judge who was presiding over the case. The following Monday, less than a single business day after the proposed order had been submitted, the judge entered the proposed order as his ruling, without changing a single word or even striking out the word “proposed.” The Brennan Center for Justice noted that it isn't clear from the record whether the judge who presided over Hamm's 1999 hearing “ever bothered to read the order.”
In 2015, when the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was reviewing Hamm's case, the court included a footnote stating that “we take this opportunity to once again strongly criticize the practice of trial courts’ uncritical wholesale adoption of the proposed orders or opinions submitted by a prevailing party.” Judge Adalberto Jordan of the Eleventh Circuit stated “I don’t believe for a second that that judge went through 89 pages in a day and then filed that as his own. As if he had gone through everything, went through his notes, the transcript, the exhibits, and the like. It just can’t be done! It just can’t be done.” Judge Jordan added that “isn’t there something fishy about such a detailed opinion being signed on a Monday after being submitted the previous Friday?”
Another problem with the 1999 hearing occurred as a result of a change in counsel. Over the objection of Hamm and Bernard Harcourt, a law professor who was then representing Hamm pro-bono, the court terminated Harcourt's representation of Hamm and appointed a new attorney to represent him during the proceedings. The new counsel, who was unfamiliar with the work that Hamm's previous attorney had been doing, called only a single witness during the trial. The court-appointed attorney did not call the expert psychologist or the mitigation psychologist, both of whom were prepared to testify about Hamm's brain damage.
These problems with Hamm's 1987 trial and 1999 hearing were significant enough to warrant a group of former judges and state bar association presidents to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to grant legal relief to Hamm. The group of former judges included a former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a former Associate Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a former Presiding Judge of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, and two former presidents of the Alabama State Bar.
Illness.
In February 2014, Hamm, who was still on death row, was diagnosed with lymphatic and cranial cancer. Doctors discovered a large malignant tumor behind his left eye and determined that Hamm suffered from B-cell lymphoma. Doctors also discovered “numerous abnormal lymph nodes” in Hamm's abdomen, lungs, and chest.
Hamm underwent years of cancer treatment, including radiation therapy, but the treatments did not eliminate the cancer entirely and, by late 2017, Hamm's cancer had worsened. By late 2017, Hamm was suffering from inflamed lymph nodes in his neck, chest, and abdomen, symptoms which are associated with worsening lymphoma. Hamm's swollen lymph nodes were observed by multiple independent medical examiners. A surgery to remove a cancerous lesion on Hamm's cheek that was eating through bone and tissue was canceled on December 13, 2017, the date it was scheduled to be performed, when the Alabama Supreme Court handed down Hamm's death warrant and scheduled an execution for a few months later.
In September 2017, when an anesthesiologist came to visit Hamm for a medical examination, he was prohibited from bringing his medical equipment past the prison security and the doctor was forced to use Hamm's lawyer's tie as a tourniquet. Andrew Cohen, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice noted that Hamm's case symbolizes the injustice of Alabama's death penalty system. Cohen observed that “the idea that executioners want to make sure they kill Hamm before he dies of cancer, the fact that it is likely the lethal injection itself will cause him "needless pain" before he dies, may be abhorrent but it's entirely consistent with the way state officials have handled Hamm's case for years.”
In addition to cancer, Hamm suffered from Hepatitis C and had a history of intravenous drug use that made it more difficult to access his veins.
Lead up to execution.
On December 13, 2017, the Alabama Supreme Court set Hamm’s execution date for Thursday, February 22, 2018.
On January 31, 2018, Chief Judge Karen O. Bowdre issued a stay of execution, finding that Hamm had shown a substantial likelihood that he would suffer irreparable injury if the execution were to go forward. In an order released on February 6, Chief Judge Bowdre ordered an independent medical examination of Hamm, finding that a medical examination was necessary in order to determine whether “Alabama's lethal injection protocol "presents a risk that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering, and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers.
Alabama appealed the district court’s order and, on February 13, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the stay and ordered the district court to immediately appoint an independent medical examiner and schedule an independent medical examination. The medical examination found that Hamm’s arms and hands were unusable, but his “lower extremities” were usable.
Calls for clemency.
In the weeks leading up to Hamm's executions, human rights experts from the United Nations called on Alabama to halt Hamm's execution. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern that the execution could amount to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, and possibly torture. The Special Rapporteurs also expressed concern that Hamm did not receive a fair trial.
Sister Helen Prejean, an anti-death penalty advocate, frequently spoke out about Hamm's execution and expressed concern that the execution would “go horribly wrong." Prejean described Alabama's decision to execute Hamm despite his cancer as “especially inhumane.” On February 20, two days before Hamm's execution was scheduled to take place, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and the International Commission Against the Death Penalty authored an open letter to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey expressing serious concern over Hamm's scheduled execution. On February 6, Hamm's attorney petitioned Governor Ivey to grant Hamm clemency. Included in Hamm's clemency petition were letters of support from family and friends, faith leaders, and community members. The Human Rights Center of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro also wrote a letter in support of clemency.
On February 21, the day prior to Hamm's scheduled execution, a group of lawyers and former judges wrote a letter to Governor Ivey, urging her not to go ahead with Hamm's execution. The group, which included former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Ernest “Sonny” Hornsby, former Court of Criminal Appeals Judge William Bowen, and two former presidents of the Alabama State Bar, warned “the prospect of the prolonged, agonizing execution of a very sick cancer patient cannot be a desirable one for anyone in our State, even those who support retention of the death penalty in general. The jurists raised the prospect that Hamm’s impending execution could turn out to be like the botched execution of Clayton Lockett, which would draw “grotesque international attention” to Alabama and its execution practices.
Attempted execution.
On February 20, two days before Hamm's execution was scheduled to take place, Chief Judge Bowdre issued an order allowing the execution to take place. At 12:30pm on February 22, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied Hamm's request for a stay of execution, prompting Hamm's counsel to appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court.
At 6:00pm on February 22, the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay of execution as it considered Hamm's claims. Almost three hours later, at approximately 8:40, the Supreme Court lifted the temporary stay and denied Hamm's petition for a stay of execution. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissented from the court's denial and noted that the method of execution that Alabama had devised in order to execute Hamm despite his cancer and venous access issues has "never been tried before in Alabama."
During the course of the execution attempt, correctional officers spent two and a half hours inserting needles into Hamm's legs and ankles, trying to get venous access. The execution team turned Hamm on his stomach and slapped the back of his legs in an attempt to find a usable vein. When attempts at peripheral venous access failed, members of the execution team began inserting needles into Hamm's groin in the hopes of finding a vein. During this process, Hamm was stabbed a half-dozen times, with needles puncturing his bladder and penetrating his femoral artery. In the days following the execution attempt, Hamm's urine contained blood as a result of the punctured bladder. During the execution, a large amount of blood accumulated around Hamm's groin, soaking through the pad he was lying on and requiring the execution team to replace it. The large amount of blood led to speculation that the executioner had also punctured Hamm's femoral artery.
When the execution was finally called off, Hamm collapsed as he was removed from the gurney. During a visit with his defense counsel the following day, Hamm was limping and sore and was described by his attorney as “a shadow of himself.” Hamm became only the third person in the United States since 1946 to walk out of the execution chamber still alive. In a press conference following the execution attempt, Jeff Dunn, Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections told reporters "I wouldn’t necessarily characterize what we had tonight as a problem.
The "New York Times" described the botched execution as "ghoulish proceedings." Sara Totonchi, executive director of the Southern Center for Human Rights described the event as "unconscionable," adding that the "attempted execution clearly demonstrates the cruelty and the torture of the death penalty." The editorial board of a local newspaper in Alabama described the attempted execution as "torture in Alabama's death chamber." In a report submitted to the federal court, the doctor who examined Hamm after the attempted execution wrote that, during the execution, Hamm wished for death "because he preferred to die rather than to continue to experience the ongoing severe pain."
Aftermath.
On March 5, 2018, Hamm and his attorney filed an amended civil rights lawsuit against the Alabama Department of Corrections. The lawsuit alleged that a second execution attempt would violate Hamm's Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Hamm also alleged that a second execution attempt would violate 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a federal law prohibiting the deprivation of civil rights. In the immediate aftermath of the execution attempt, the Alabama Attorney General's Office would not comment on whether it would seek a second execution attempt.
On March 26, 2018, a little over a month after the attempted execution, Hamm and the state of Alabama reached a confidential settlement. The settlement “resolved all of the state and federal litigation” that was still pending in the case at the time and ended the efforts by Alabama to set a second execution date for Hamm.
In a press conference announcing that Oklahoma would move forward with executions by inert gas inhalation, Joe Allbaugh, the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, described the attempt to execute Hamm as "inhumane."
Following Hamm's attempted execution, the Associated Press and other news outlets requested the state's execution protocol and related records. The state initially denied the request, claiming that the execution protocol was secret. A district court ordered that that state could not keep its protocol secret and had to disclose the requested records. In March 2019, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling. The Eleventh Circuit wrote that “The fact that Alabama zealously guards information about a matter of great public concern does not tip the scales against disclosure. The court concludes that the considerations in favor of unsealing the records greatly outweigh Alabama’s interest in maintaining secrecy.”
The events surrounding Alabama's attempt to execute Hamm were recounted in a Supreme Court brief that was filed in "Bucklew v. Precythe", a 2019 Supreme Court case concerning the death penalty. The brief was filed on behalf of former federal and state judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials, who were urging the Supreme Court to prohibit the execution of Russell Bucklew. Bucklew was ultimately executed in October 2019.

HMS Fleetwood (U47)

HMS "Fleetwood" was a sloop of the Royal Navy. Built at Devonport Dockyard in the 1930s, "Fleetwood" was launched in March 1936 and commissioned in November that year. She served in the Red Sea until the outbreak of the Second World War. "Fleetwood" served as a convoy escort during the war, which she survived, and sank the German submarines and . Post-war, the ship served as a radar training ship, remaining in use until 1959, when she was scrapped.
Construction and design.
HMS "Fleetwood" was one of two s constructed under the 1934 construction programme for the Royal Navy. She was ordered from Devonport Dockyard on 1 March 1935. Two "Grimsby"-class sloops had been ordered under each of the 1931, 1932 and 1933 programmes, giving a total of eight "Grimsby"-class ships built for the Royal Navy. Four more were built for Australia and one for India. The "Grimsby" class, while based on the previous , was intended to be a more capable escort vessel than previous sloops, and carried a more powerful armament.
"Fleetwood" was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. Displacement was standard, and full load. The ship was powered by two geared steam turbines driving two shafts, fed by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers. This machinery produced and could propel the ship to a speed of . The ship had a range of at .
While previous ships of the class had been built with a gun armament of 4.7-inch (120 mm) low-angle guns, designed for use against surface targets, by 1934 it was realised that attack from the air posed a significant risk to shipping, and it was decided to fit the sloops of the 1934 programme with an improved anti-aircraft armament. "Fleetwood" was selected to carry the prototype fitting of the new QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun, carrying two twin mounts with an appropriate fire-control system. This was supplemented by a quadruple .50 in (12.7 mm) Vickers anti-aircraft machine gun mount. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ship's gun armament. The initial anti-submarine armament consisted of two depth charge throwers and two rails, with a loadout of 40 depth charges.
"Fleetwood" was laid down on 14 August 1935, launched on 24 March 1936 and completed on 19 November 1936.
Modifications.
A second quadruple 0.50 in machine gun mount was fitted in 1938. The close-in anti-aircraft armament was further supplemented in 1941, when three Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were added, while a further three Oerlikons replaced the multiple machine guns in 1942, while the saluting guns were removed during the war. The ship's depth charge loading increased to 60–90 during the war, while a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was fitted in 1943.
Service.
After commissioning, "Fleetwood" served as trials ship for the new armament, and then visited Gibraltar, Tangier and Cartagena, Spain during February–March 1937. She then carried out a number of visits around the coast of Britain, including her namesake town of Fleetwood and carried out more trials work before leaving for her station on the Red Sea, arriving at Aden on 27 March 1938.
"Fleetwood" was recalled to Home waters following the outbreak of the Second World War, arriving at Portland on 11 October 1939 and was tasked with providing escort to convoys along the East coast of Britain. In April 1940, Germany invaded Norway, with "Fleetwood" attached to the Home Fleet. She provided anti-aircraft cover for landings at Åndalsnes and Molde, and when the sloop was damaged by German bombs, "Fleetwood" towed the damaged ship back to Lerwick in Shetland. She then returned to Romsdalsfjord, relieving the damaged sloop on 28 April. On 29 April she was near missed by a German bomb, which caused little damage, and was herself relieved on 30 April by the sloop and the cruiser , having fired all her anti-aircraft ammunition. "Fleetwood" evacuated 340 troops on her return to Britain. On 11–12 May 1940 "Fleetwood" helped to land troops at Mo i Rana, and came under heavy air attack. On 27 May 1940, "Fleetwood" helped escort the badly damaged destroyer , which had her bow blown off at the Second Battle of Narvik, from Harstad back to Britain.
Following the end of operations off Norway, "Fleetwood" returned to East coast convoy duties, which continued until January 1941 when she was transferred to Londonderry for escort duties in the Atlantic. She remained operating out of Londonderry until June 1941 when she moved to Newfoundland. "Fleetwood" returned to Britain in August 1941 when she was refitted at Middlesbrough, where radar was fitted and her anti-aircraft armament improved. On completion of the refit in September that year, she joined the 44th Escort Group based at Londonderry, escorting convoys to and from Freetown, Sierra Leone.
"Fleetwood" collided with the tanker "Oil Reliance" on 2 June 1942 while escorting the convoy OS30 to Freetown. She was under repair and undergoing a refit at Liverpool until August that year. "Fleetwood" then returned to service on the Freetown route. In November that year, "Fleetwood" was employed escorting convoys to and from North Africa following Operation Torch, the Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, and in December joined the 43rd Escort Group based at Gibraltar for escort duties in the Western Mediterranean.
In April 1943, "Fleetwood" returned to Londonderry, joining the 39th Escort group on the Freetown route. On 11 May 1943, "Fleetwood" was part of the escort of Sierra Leone-bound convoy OS47, when a Handley Page Halifax patrol aircraft of 58 Squadron RAF spotted the German submarine , which was returning to France after being damaged by a previous air attack, and attacked with depth charges. "Fleetwood" was sent from the convoy to follow up the air attack, and carried out a series of depth charge attacks on the submarine, forcing "U-528" to surface, where she was shelled by "Fleetwood" and the corvette , forcing the submarine's crew to scuttle the submarine and abandon ship. "Fleetwood" rescued 39 of "U-528"s crew, including her commanding officer, while "Mignonette" picked up 6 more and 11 men were killed.
"Fleetwood" was refitted at Dundee in July–August 1943, when she was fitted with updated radar and with HF/DF gear. In October 1943 she joined the 41st Escort Group based at Gibraltar. On the early morning of 1 November 1943 a Vickers Wellington of 179 Squadron RAF attacked the German submarine in the mouth of the Strait of Gibraltar, damaging the submarine. Later that day, "U-340" was located by "Fleetwood" and the destroyers and , who attacked with depth charges, further damaging the submarine, which scuttled herself later that day. The crew of the submarine were rescued by a Spanish fishing trawler, but were then captured by "Fleetwood".
On 17 November 1943, "Fleetwood" collided with the US patrol boat , and then with a jetty. "Fleetwood" was badly damaged, and was under repair at Gibraltar until the end of March 1944. She then joined the 41st Escort Group, escorting convoys along the Mediterranean until entering refit at Haifa in September 1944. In October "Fleetwood" joined the 50th Escort Flotilla bases at Alexandria for escort duties in the Eastern Mediterranean, before returning to British waters at the end of the year. She continued to serve with Portsmouth Command until the end of the war in Europe.
On 4 August 1945 "Fleetwood" was laid up in reserve at Hartlepool. She was selected to serve as a Radar Training ship attached to the ASRE, and was refitted at Portsmouth, her armament being removed and her bridge enlarged to give increased accommodation. She was refitted again in 1950, and took part in the Fleet review for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953. "Fleetwood" was paid off into reserve at Portsmouth in December 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959, leaving Portsmouth for breaking up at C.W. Dorkings yard at Gateshead on 6 December 1959.
Pennant number.
Note: The Pennant number was not painted on the ship's side until September 1939.

Biology.
This species is a kleptoparasite of "Diadasia olivacea". They will perch alert outside the host nest and wait for the host to leave before entering for short visits of 20 seconds to inspect the nest, then on the last visit disappearing for 2 minutes to lay their own egg inside. Their eggs have a long incubation period compared to the host. Their first instar young does not feed, but dispatches the much larger host larva, and then molts to a second instar, and consumes the host's pollen provisions.

Taj Mah

Taj Mah (1926 – after 1935) was an Irish-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She showed ability as a two-year-old in France when she won three of her five races but was not expected to make further progress. In the spring of 1929 she was sent to England and recorded a 33/1 upset victory in the 1000 Guineas but never raced again. As a broodmare she produced at least two high-class winners.
Background.
Taj Mah was a "tiny" grey mare, standing barely 15 hands high bred in Ireland by Aga Khan III. As a yearling she was considered surplus to her owner's requirements and put up for sale. She was bought for 250,000 francs by Simon Guthmann who sent her into training in France with the Argentinian Juan Torterolo.
She was from one of the last crops of foals sired by Lemberg, whose wins included the Epsom Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Champion Stakes. Lemberg also sired the Ellangowan and Pogrom and had been Champion sire in 1922. Her dam Taj Mahal also produced Taj Kasra (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Taj Shirin, the dam of the Derby runner-up Taj Akbar and the Irish Derby winner Nathoo.
Racing career.
1928: two-year-old season.
Taj Mah won three minor races from five starts in France in 1928 and was rated the ninth best juvenile of the season in the French Handicap Libre. The filly was however thought to have stamina limitations and unlikely to stay further than 1200 metres (six furlongs).
1929: three-year-old season.
Juan Torterolo felt that there was little point in sending the filly to race in England in the spring of 1929 but was overruled by the owner and Taj Mah temporarily joined the stable of Victor Gilpin at Newmarket. Her chances of success in Britain were not improved when she became highly agitated and distressed on the boat journey across the English Channel. On 3 May, with the Australian Wally Sibbritt in the saddle, she started a 33/1 outsider in a 19 runner field for the 116th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. Before the race she looked unimpressive being described as "deficient in size" and a mere "pony" in comparison to her rivals. The joint-favourites for the ace were Sister Anne and Almondale while the other fancied runners included Necklace (Prix Morny) and Arabella (Queen Mary Stakes, Champagne Stakes). In a major upset Taj Mah took the lead from Arabella a furlong from the finish and won by a length from Sister Anne, with Ellanvale a short head away in third place.
Taj Mah did not race again and was retired at the end of the year.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Taj Mah a "poor" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
After her retirement from racing Taj Mah became a broodmare for Simon Guthmann's stud. She produced at least three foals between 1931 and 1935:

You Weren't There (song)

"You Weren't There" is a song by Norwegian singer-songwriter Lene Marlin. Written by Marlin and produced by Mike Hodges, the song was released as the first single from Marlin's sophomore studio album, "Another Day". The song became Marlin's last hit outside Norway and Italy; it reached number one in both countries but remained a minor hit in the rest of Europe.
Lyrical content.
Lyrically, the song outlines events in the lives of several children, but someone playing an important role in their lives—possibly a parent or an ex-lover—is not with them to witness their victories and tragedies, living far away. The children have been distressed by these absences, worrying that they will miss the specific people every time they close their eyes. The first verse is about a girl who wins a game after a long period of longing for the win, but a specific person is not there to share in her happiness, even though she tried to make this person proud.
In the second verse, a boy celebrates his birthday, receiving gifts and phone calls, but does not receive anything from an unknown person, which has been a regular occurrence for several years. Next, a girl get a paper-cut and is upset when she sees her blood, but no one is there to make her feel better. The fourth verse describes a boy crying from a broken heart, and the narrator asks how loud he has to cry for an absent individual to hear him. The final verse mentions what these people did cannot be undone, and that the children make up stories about them and long for their return.
Commercial performance.
The song made its first chart appearance on the Norwegian Singles Chart on the 38th chart week of 2003, corresponding to early September, debuting at number one and replacing fellow Norwegian singer David's song "Wild at Heart" at the top spot. It spent another week at number one before "Wild at Heart" returned to number one, knocking "You Weren't There" to number three on chart week 40. The song spent three more weeks in the top 10 before falling to number 11 on week 45. It stayed in the top 20 for four more weeks before dropping off the chart.
In Italy, the song also debuted at number one on 11 September, dethroning Evanescence's "Bring Me to Life". The next week, the song dropped to number five, then to number seven the week after. It returned to number five on 2 October, but moved down to number nine the following week. On 16 October, the single rose up to number four before dropping out of the top 10 on 23 October. It returned to the top 10 for the final week at number 10 on 13 November. For the next four weeks, it fluctuated around the top 20 until leaving the chart from number 19 on 11 December. It was Italy's 21st-best-selling hit of the year.
Outside Norway and Italy, the song did not make a major impact in Europe. In late September, the song debuted and peaked at number 39 on Sweden's Sverigetopplistan chart (then named Hitlistan), becoming Lene Marlin's final top-40 single there. In Switzerland the same month, the song first appeared on the Schweizer Hitparade chart at number 89 on 28 September, then peaked at number 74 the following week, spending six non-consecutive weeks on the chart altogether. Also on 28 September, the song debuted at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart, but dropped out of the top 100 the week after, becoming her final chart hit there. It was also her last hit in France, where it charted for a single week at number 89 on 2 November.
Music video.
A music video was made for "You Weren't There". The first scene depicts a girl waking up on a platform overlooking a lake with a picture in her hand, but when she steps up to the railing and looks at the photograph, the wind rips it out of her hands and blows it away, to her visible disappointment. It then cuts to Marlin singing the opening verse in a small, empty classroom, followed by the girl from the opening seen having romantic moments with the man in the photograph. During the chorus, the lovers are shown happily jumping into the lake, then sitting on dry ground sharing a kiss. Marlin is then seen singing on the platform by the lake and in an alley as the couple work together to shoot a basketball into the hoop. As Marlin continues to sing on the basketball court, the couple sit and talk at a bus stop with sad expressions on their faces. The two are then seen hugging at a train station, where the girl boards a train and the man sees her off. During this time, Marlin sings on the platform from the beginning. The video finishes with shots of the empty classroom, the pier where the couple jumped into the lake, and the platform on the body of water.

It is the C18 methyl or C13β ethyl derivative of metribolone. The compound is closely related to tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), which has the same chemical structure as RU-2309 except for possessing an ethyl group at the C17α position instead of a methyl group. Hence, it could also be referred to as 17α-methyl-THG. RU-2309 shows high affinity for the androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors.

They included the ubiquitous "Severus", stern or severe, "Donatus", gifted, and probably "Balbinus", a diminutive of "Balbus", one who stammers. "Pompeianus", borne by one of the family, probably indicates that he was descended from the Pompeia gens through one of his maternal ancestors.

S. G. Kingston

Strickland Gough Kingston (1848 – 3 October 1897), usually referred to by his initials or as "Pat", was a prominent lawyer in South Australia. He was a brother of Charles Kingston, who was Premier of South Australia from 1893 to 1899. Brilliant but unstable, he died by his own hand.
History.
Kingston was born in Adelaide the elder son of (later Sir) George Kingston, an Irish-born surveyor, landowner and parliamentarian. He was educated at Adelaide Educational Institution, where he was considered, with his brother and (later Dr.) Joseph Verco, one of its three brightest students.
He was also a fine athlete and sportsman, excelling in long-distance running, jumping, boxing and on the football field.
On leaving school he found employment with the Bank of Australasia (Samuel Tomkinson was manager at the time), then decided to study law. Samuel Way took him on as an articled clerk, then when in 1876 Way was elevated to Chief Justice of South Australia, his articles were transferred to Josiah Symon, Way's partner.
Kingston was admitted to the bar in April 1879 and joined his brother in partnership as Kingston &amp; Kingston, solicitors, with offices in Eagle Chambers, Pirie Street. The practice was successful, but cut short by a stupid act on (S. G.) Kingston's part:
On Sunday 8 June 1884 around 4 pm Kingston, carrying a saloon rifle in a bag, boarded a cab operated by one Patrick Guerrin, who sported a tall felt hat "after the American pattern".
He had been carried along Pirie Street as far as Hindmarsh Square when he took it into his head to put a bullet through the "topper" of the cabman, but whether through carelessness, inebriation or (as Kingston claimed) a sudden lurch of the vehicle, the slug went low and lodged in Guerrin's scalp. The cabman immediately ejected Kingston, and appears to have demanded money (perhaps £1000, then £300) to avoid a criminal charge, which Kingston refused. Kingston was duly charged, convicted and jailed for six months, confounding skeptics, who predicted he would, by virtue of his profession and connections, somehow be treated lightly.
By this time Charles Kingston, who dearly loved his older brother, had been appointed Attorney-General in the Colton Cabinet and dropped his legal practice; otherwise it is likely that despite his brother's mad action and consequent disgrace, their business partnership would have been renewed. Certainly he never distanced himself from his aberrant brother.
In January 1885 Kingston returned to legal practice in the old offices, and appears to have had no shortage of clients. In March 1886 he moved to offices in Lipson Street, Port Adelaide, then in July 1889 to Church Street, Port Augusta. He was an extremely clever lawyer and was able by sophisticated arguments to save many wealthy clients from the legal consequences of their actions.
"The Chairman caused some amusement by reading a cutting reporting the trial before justices at Port Augusta of two cases in which the defendants were charged by the District Council of Woolundunga with neglecting to destroy rabbits. In both cases Mr. N. A. Webb appeared for the District Council, and Mr. S. G. Kingston for the defendants. So far as reported the cases seemed exactly similar, but the results were widely different. In the first one Hannah Tapley pleaded guilty, and was promptly fined £2 and costs. Mr. Andrew Tennant appears to have been better advised and pleaded not guilty, and the information was dismissed. The arguments of Mr. S. G. Kingston appear to have completely capsized the justices, and were most ingenious. "There was no proof that such a council as that of Woolundunga existed," "there was no proof that the Chairman Mr. W. Q. Pryor held that office," and "there was no proof that the council authorised the notice which appeared in the Government Gazette." Of course there is no suggestion that Mr. Tennant got off because he was a rich man. It was doubtless miserable Hannah Tapley's own fault in speaking the truth that caused her to be fined."
Death.
Around mid-September 1897 Kingston was in Adelaide to appear in an action being heard before the Supreme Court, and expressed to his brother-in-law Hubert Giles his confidence in the outcome. He took it badly however when the verdict went the other way. Canon Hopcraft of St. John's (Anglican) church, Adelaide, a longtime friend and confidante, reported that he took this loss personally, and was not seen sober for several days.
Back in Port Augusta, Kingston, never a temperate man, and frequently driven to excessive drinking, "had been in a very depressed state of mind for some time" and was suffering the after-effects of a heavy night when he received news of a client having withdrawn from a case, though there is no indication that precipitated what happened next.
He shot himself through the heart with a Martini-Henry sporting rifle at his office in Church Street at 2.40 pm on 4 October 1897 and died shortly after. Charles Kingston, who had recently returned from a triumphant visit to the United Kingdom, followed by a meeting with the Federation Commission, where he was elected chairman; cancelled all appointments and with his Commissioner of Crown Lands (L. O'Loughlin) was on the 4.30 pm Broken Hill express, and at Petersburg had a "special" waiting to take them to Port Augusta, arriving at 3.45 am. After viewing the body, which caused Charles Kingston great distress, they returned with the coffin by the same train.
His remains were deposited in the family mausoleum, West Terrace Cemetery.
Family.
On 25 September 1879 Kingston married Kathleen Pittar Stanton ( – 3 June 1929) daughter of Rev. L. W. Stanton, Anglican clergyman at Burra and Kapunda, later of Coombe Keynes, Dorset, England. They had two daughters:
He was described as a loving father, but it is likely he and his wife had separated: at the time of his death Kathleen Kingston was had been living with her sister Phoebe Stanton in Glenelg for some years, and may have never stayed in Port Augusta. Her sister ran "Blanche Villa", a boarding school for girls in Glenelg.

The species was first described in 1997 as "Amitostigma thailandicum". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis thailandica".

Elizabeth Paston

Elizabeth Paston (1429 – 1 February 1488) was a member of the English gentry who is regularly referred to in the extensive collection of Paston Letters. She was the only daughter of a Norfolk lawyer, William Paston and Agnes Barry. In her late teens and twenties she resisted marriage to several men proposed by her mother and brothers, before marrying Sir Robert Poynings in 1458, with whom she had a son Edward Poynings.
Following her husband's death at the Second Battle of St Albans in 1461, she spent a period as a widow before marrying George Browne by whom she had two further children. Browne's execution in 1483 following his involvement in a rebellion against Richard III left her a widow again.
Family.
Elizabeth Paston, born 1429 in Norfolk, was the middle child and only daughter of William Paston, Justice of the Common Pleas, and Agnes Barry, the daughter and co-heir of Sir Edmund Barry (d. 1433) of Hertfordshire. Elizabeth had four brothers, the eldest of whom, John Paston (died 1466), succeeded her father in 1444 as heir and head of the family.
Marriage proposals and marriages.
By the standards of the time Elizabeth Paston married late; she was nearly 30 when she married in 1458. Her father William had left her £200 towards her marriage in his will, provided that she married according to the advice of her mother and his other executors. Potential marriages had been under discussion from at least the time she was nineteen in 1449 when marriage was proposed with a fifty-year-old widower Stephen Scrope, whose stepfather John Fastolf was John Paston's chief patron.
Elizabeth was being harshly treated at home by her mother, Agnes, who, as her cousin Elizabeth Clere reported in a letter of 1449, beat her regularly. However, her brother John, who was responsible for organising her dowry, was slow to do so. Various suitors were put forward during the 1450s but marriage did not materialise until 1458 when Elizabeth married Robert Poynings, one of the younger sons of a Sussex landowner. It may not have been a love match but within a year she had a son, Edward Poynings. Edward was born in 1459, only months before Robert Poynings was killed fighting on the Yorkist side at the second battle of St Albans.
Elizabeth was left a widow to bring up their son. Edward Poynings was to become a trusted administrator of King Henry VII. In his role as deputy lord lieutenant in Ireland he was responsible for the famous "Poynings' Law" which clearly subordinated the Anglo-Irish and the Irish to the authority of the English parliament.
Elizabeth Poynings (nee Paston) was a widow for over a decade, until she remarried in 1471 to George Browne, landowner of Betchworth in Surrey. With Browne Elizabeth had two further children, a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Mary. Browne was actively involved in politics, both local and national. Twelve years after their marriage George Browne - accompanied by his stepson Edward Poynings - was involved in the unsuccessful rebellion of Henry, Duke of Buckingham against King Richard III in 1483.
Elizabeth's husband was beheaded on Tower Hill in London that December, leaving Elizabeth a widow as a result of political activity during the wars of the roses for the second time. She was not to remarry.
Will.
Elizabeth Browne died in 1488, aged 58 or 59. Her adult life had been dominated and significantly marked by the political activities of both her husbands and also by her elder son Edward. Her extensive will shows that she was a devout widow but also a very wealthy one, with an extensive list of valuables and jewels left to her descendants.

Russ music

Russ music () is a subgenre of electronic dance music and a music scene which originated from Norway during the mid 2000s. Drawing inspiration from EDM, hip hop and techno. Russ music is characterized by its fast tempo, synthesizers, notable bass and explicit lyrics, often combined with rapping.
Usually, this type of music are produced on request by Norwegian high school graduates to promote their "russ concept" as a part of the russ celebration.
Russ music has lately been labeled as a controversial genre as a part of an constantly growing market. Record producers are heavily criticized for their use of explicit lyrics, as the distribution of russ music has grown to be an independent music industry in Norway.

Poklad (video game)

Poklad (English: Treasure) is a 1984 Czech text adventure video game for Sinclair ZX Spectrum computers and compatible systems. it was authored by František Fuka as his first text video game. It was published by Proxima Software as part of their "Fuxoft uvádí" series. A newer version of the game (as opposed to a sequel) entitled Poklad 2 was designed in 1985 and released in 1992.
Production.
"Poklad " is one of the oldest surviving games created in Czechoslovakia. František Fuka had previously created several games on the Commodore VIC-20, however he would sell the computer along with its software to an unknown buyer, and those games would not survive. Fuka, a 16-year-old computer enthusiast, programmed the game on his friend's ZX Spectrum as he didn't have a computer of his own. Fuka first got interested in games after his uncle bought him a copy of Creative Computing magazine, which he wrote for; Fuaka began reading reviews and ads for text adventures. He had been inspired to make the game after playing a different game called "Poklad" (which the thesis "The Beginnings of Czech and Slovak Digital Narrativity: The History of Text Computer games in Czechoslovakia" surmises as a translation of a Western game) on the ZX81 computer. Fuka programmed it entirely from memory. 
"Poklad " is considered a beta version of "Poklad 2", for this reason Fuka himself deems "Boxing" (1985) his first video game and he expressly acknowledges the first game's non-existence. Poklad 2 was translated into English, although Fuka does not remember who did the translation. Polka is sometimes considered the first Czechoslovak game, however depending on the definition earlier video games may have existed through the 1970s. Text-based adventures would become the most popular video gaming genre throughout the second half of the 1980s, with over 500 games created; this is because they were easy to make (one developer could make a game in 2-3 weeks), and easy to translate to Western languages. 
Fuka created the title without any expectation of financial gain. The Czechoslovak video gaming development industry was predominantly young high school or college aged males who attended computer clubs, and who made games individually. This made it difficult for the amateur one-team developers to complete with Western professional companies. Fuka would proclaim in 1998: "The few individuals that make games in our country can naturally hardly compete with teams of specialists, for whom making games is not only fun, but also a job (a paid one, of course). One person can hardly be a good author of a game idea, a programmer, a graphic artist, a musician and also have enough time to pull it all off".
Plot and gameplay.
The player finds themselves in a magical country and their task is to find five treasures. The game consists of a 4 x 5 room matrix in three levels. Gameplay consists of a classic text adventure game.
Reception.
Tiscali.cz thought it was a very simple and short attempt at a game, but that it offered a great foreshadowing of where Fuka's career would end up.

Etimesgut railway station

Etimesgut railway station () is a railway station in Etimesgut, Ankara, currently under renovation. The station was a stop on the Ankara suburban from 1972 to 2016, when the station was closed for renovation. Once the rebuilt station is opened, commuter rail service will resume. Etimesgut station is located along İstasyon Avenue, near Hikmet Özer Avenue.
History.
The original station was built in 1925, by the Turkish government-owned Anatolian—Baghdad Railways, to service the newly formed neighborhood of Etimesgut. The station house was designed by Turkish architect Burhaneddin Tamcı, who also designed the station house of the nearby Gazi station. Until his death in 1938, when President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk traveled from Ankara, Etimesgut station was where public crowds would gather to watch his train pass by. 
When the nearby Ankara Sugarcane Mill opened in 1962, freight rail cars were stored at the station's small yard. This continued until the 1990s, when the mill replaced freight rail transport with trucks. 
In 1970, the Turkish State Railways expanded the station, adding a new platform in preparation for electric commuter rail service from Sincan to Kayaş. The new platform entered service in 1972 when the Ankara suburban entered revenue service. Once commuter rail service began, intercity and regional trains bypassed Etimesgut and the station became a local stop only. In 2012, the small siding on the north side of the station grounds was replaced with a new track for YHT high-speed rail. On 11 July 2016, Etimesgut station was closed to passenger traffic and the platform demolished shortly after. The railway was widened from three to five tracks and a new island platform was built with a new station house over it. The station is expected to re-open on 12 April 2018.

<doc id="56965516" url="?curid=56965516" title="Garve and Ullapool Railway">
Garve and Ullapool Railway

The Garve and Ullapool Railway was one of several branch railway-lines proposed for the North-West Highlands of Scotland, in the 1880s and 1890s. The project received approval from the Westminster Parliament by means of a Local Act of 14 August 1890. The line did not gain financial backing and was never constructed. Renewed attempts to build it were made in 1896, 1901, 1918 and 1945, again with no success.
Social Background.
In the early 1880s, long-term deprivation and scarceness of land drove several communities on the West of Scotland to carry out acts of civil disobedience – rent-strikes and land-raids - collectively termed ‘The Crofters’ War’. This also resulted in the formation of the Highland Land League and a political party named The Crofters Party which returned several members to the Westminster Parliament. In the investigations which were set up in the aftermath of these events, principally driven by the Napier Commission of 1883, it was acknowledged that the people of the west Highlands and Islands had a justifiable grievance.
In an effort to alleviate conditions, proposals were made, firstly, to reform the laws of land-ownership, and secondly, to develop the fisheries by opening up markets in the British cities. This latter goal was to be achieved primarily by improving transport-links (i.e. harbours and railways) between the west coast and central Scotland and the south.
All of this also came at a time when various private companies were developing – or wishing to develop – railway lines across Scotland, to capitalise on the Victorian tourist boom and the increased leisure-time of the middle- and upper-classes. Principal among these companies were Great North of Scotland Railway, the Highland Railway and the Caledonian Railway. All of these companies, and several more promoters besides, were anxious to have their proposals adopted by Parliament and – more importantly – funded from the taxpayers’ purse.
History.
In 1890, six lines connecting the west of north Scotland to the central spine were to be considered by a Parliamentary Commission. These were:
All six lines were designed to open up access to new or established fishing ports and/or passenger-boat ports on the west coast.
Proposal and Route.
The specific plan for the Garve and Ullapool Railway was first proposed in January 1889 by local landowners in the Lochbroom and Assynt area, who formally invited the Highland Railway to construct a line to Ullapool. The proposal was backed by Sir John Fowler, engineer in charge of the building of the Forth Bridge, and a number of local MPs and luminaries. The Highland Line company was not enthusiastic, since it had its own plans to drive a line through to Kyle of Lochalsh and was prepared to invest £120,000 to do so; but it agreed to conduct a brief survey, which was undertaken in July 1889, at a cost of £80.
The route laid out on the plans showed the line branching off the Dingwall to Skye line about east of Garve station, at a height of around . It then led in a north-westerly direction, following the right (south/west) bank of the Black Water river (in essence, parallelling the route of the modern A835 road); it then passed through the glen at Glascarnoch (note that Loch Glascarnoch did not exist then – it is a reservoir created in the mid-1950s ), rising to and continued as far as Braemore Lodge (where the A832 road now branches off). A steep descent of in the space of - a challenging gradient of 1-in-26 - would have been required to bring the line to sea-level at the head of Loch Broom; but the engineers instead planned to construct a tunnel through the hillside on the west side of the descent, and then descend to the mouth of the River Broom, after which the line would follow the coast as far as Ullapool. The terminus would have been at the junction of Shore Street and Quay Street, at the end of the pier. The total measured distance was just over (to be precise: "thirty-three miles five furlongs four chains and fifty links").
An original suggestion by the proposers for an onward route between Ullapool and Lochinver was never surveyed or planned in any detail.
Quest for Backers.
The Garve and Ullapool Railway Act, 1890, of the Westminster Parliament received Royal Assent on 14 August 1890. In the papers relating to this Act, the proprietors of the proposed railway were named as : Lady Mary Matheson of the Lews (widow of James Matheson, 1st Baronet, and owner of the Isle of Lewis and most of Ullapool); Donald Matheson; Major Duncan Matheson; John Arthur Fowler (Sir John’s son); and Major James Houston; and the directors were named all of these except for Lady Matheson. Sir John Fowler was to be Consulting Engineer. The Crofters Party MP for Ross &amp; Cromarty, Dr Roderick Macdonald, also backed the scheme. The cost of construction was estimated at £240,000.
The Parliamentary Commission of 1890 delayed in reporting its findings. In the interim, it was clear that the Highland Railway had been lobbying hard in Westminster, proposing that a grant of £45,000 from central funds would allow the extension from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh to be built. The backers of the Garve line were aware to Highland Railway’s reluctance, and met with the Great North of Scotland Railway board to suggest that it took over the construction and running of the line. In the summer of 1891, a new Private Bill was proposed at Westminster to transfer arrangements for the construction and running of the line from the Highland Railway to the Great North of Scotland company.
The Commission of Inquiry published its report in the summer of 1891, recommending that the best option of the original six was the extension of the line from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh. The backers of the Ullapool line and local MPs were highly critical of this decision – noting amongst other things that there were glaring factual errors concerning the navigability of Loch Broom, and hence obstacles to establishing Ullapool as a port. But their protests were to no avail. Despite a belated attempt by the Great North of Scotland company to adopt the scheme, by Private Bill on 31 May 1892, the scheme could attract no further political or financial interest. 
In June 1893, an Act was passed, authorising the extension of the line from Stromeferry to Kyle of Lochalsh; this was shortly followed by a Local Act, dated 24 August 1893, which finally abandoned the Ullapool proposal.
Further Proposals and Legacy.
Although further railway-line extensions were authorised during the 1890s – and partly as a result of these - a Light Railways Act was passed in 1896, which encouraged the development of light railways on the west coast and the islands. John Arthur Fowler proposed that the Garve and Ullapool Railway be considered as one project under this Act and offered it again to the Highland Railway to run. The Highland Railway replied that it would do so only if Fowler raised the capital to build it – which he was unable to do.
In 1901, Major Blunt-Mackenzie (husband of the Countess of Cromartie) proposed building the line as a 'tram-way', to support the west coast fisheries; but could get no financial backing for the scheme from the Government-backed Congested Districts Board.
Towards the end of the First World War, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Robert Munro set up the "Rural Transport (Scotland) Committee", a commission to recommend improvements to the poor road, rail and sea transport facilities in Scotland. The commission invited applications from County Councils and local interest groups, for consideration of proposals. A local committee was set up in Ullapool, and made a strong case for the building of the Garve and Ullapool Railway. The Rural Transport Committee was duly impressed and, when its report appeared in April 1919, it recommended that the railway be constructed, completely funded by the government. But, along with many other schemes and radical proposals made by the Committee, nothing happened.
In 1945, Commander Vyner, a local Ullapool landowner, tried to persuade the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) to build and run the railway. The LMS estimated the cost to be £1 million and refused to have anything to do with the scheme.
The construction of the line from Garve to Ullapool was imagined in a novel by Andrew Drummond ("An Abridged History…") in 2004.

Amy Sayer

Amy Joan Irene Sayer (born 30 November 2001) is an Australian soccer player at Stanford Cardinal. She primarily plays as an attacking midfielder but was also deployed as a defensive midfielder in the under-20s national team. She is known for her vision, passing, all round technical ability, and her ability to play and score with both feet.
On 16 July 2018, Sayer received her first call up to the Matildas, the senior Australian Women's Team, for the 2018 Tournament of Nations.
Early life and education.
Born in Sydney, Australia, Sayer grew up in Northern Sydney, where attended Ravenswood School for Girls and later Barker College. She was granted special permission to not attend classes due to her international team commitments and playing for Canberra United during the W-League season.
Club career.
Junior career.
Sayer began her youth career at Northbridge FC (now known as North Shore Mariners), as well as playing futsal and football at the FNSW Institute.
Several clubs were interested in signing Sayer for the 2016 W-League season, however due to her age, she decided to stay closer to home, signing for Sydney University on a youth contract.
Canberra United.
Canberra United signed several young talents to play in the 2017 W-League season. Sayer joined the club after some impressive performances for the Australian National U-20 Women's Team, along with teammates Georgia Plessas, Georgia Boric, Clare Hunt, and Karly Roestbakken.
On 25 November, Amy Sayer scored her first goal in the country's top division in a 3–2 home win against Perth Glory at McKellar Park. Sayer finished the season with one goal in 10 appearances, as well as being deployed in various positions such as an attacking midfielder and a left winger by manager Heather Garriock.
Sydney FC.
Sayer signed for Sydney FC on 4 September 2018 after one season at Canberra United in the W-League. On 3 November, she scored her maiden goal for her new club in her first appearance.
On 9 November 2018, Sayer was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her right foot. She was withdrawn from the Australia squad for the Seven Consulting Series against Chile, and was ruled out for at least 12 weeks. Her next appearance in a football match will be in January 2019, at the earliest.
College career.
In January 2020, Sayer was accepted to Stanford University, and joined them at the conclusion of the 2019–20 W-League, playing for Stanford Cardinal.
International career.
Sayer made her international youth debut on 25 August 2016, in a 28–0 demolition of Palestine, played at Vietnam. She marked her debut with one goal and seven assists in the first half of the match. She followed the first cap with three more dominating displays against Hong Kong (14–0), Iraq (8–0) and Vietnam (6–0).
At the age of 14 years old, Sayer earned her first call up to the U-20 squad for the AFC Pre-qualifiers in November 2016. She made two appearances in two games, playing full minutes and scoring two goals. Following her debut tournament, Sayer was reselected in the Young Matilda's squad for the friendly series against USA and Canada in July 2017, and for the 2017 AFC Qualification Tournament held in China where she made four more appearances in the group stage and final series. She made another appearance in the 2018 friendly match against Thailand where she scored one goal.
On 16 July 2018, Alen Stajcic called up Sayer to the senior Matildas squad to participate in the Tournament of Nations in the United States after impressing in her maiden W-League season in with 10 appearances. She earned her first international cap as a 93rd-minute substitute in the 2018 Tournament of Nations against Japan.
Sayer was called up to the Matildas squad for the second time to play matches against France and England in October 2018. She came on as a substitute against France but couldn't salvage a 2-0 defeat, while she started the second match against England in a 1-1 draw following a last minute header from Clare Polkinghorne.
Later in October, Sayer joined the Young Matildas on their trip to Lebanon, to play Mongolia, Lebanon and Hong Kong. She scored a hat-trick in the 18-0 demolition of Mongolia, while an assist and a goal against Lebanon, and one assist with a brace against Hong Kong, converting the first from the penalty spot, and the second from outside the box.
On 9 November 2018, Sayer withdrew from the Matildas squad in the two-match series against Chile after a stress fracture diagnosis.
Style of Play.
An attacking midfielder and playmaker, Sayer is adept at finding quality forward passes and likes to combine with others for quick passing moves rather than carrying the ball too often. While Sayer is an excellent athlete, her style draws more on her technical range, vision and creativity and she would prefer to play an incisive pass or use one touch passing combinations to beat a player – rather than looking to rely on speed in a footrace.
In the front third she is an increasingly unpredictable and dangerous attacker as she adds more variety to her attacking style – while she is naturally inclined to look for a clever through pass or combination play to attack the opponent's penalty box, she is equally capable of scoring from range on either foot and is demonstrating this more and more with some eye-catching long distance goals at club and international level.

William Conway (Irish republican)

William Conway (1902- 9 June 1976) was born in Ballycrenode in 1902, Co Tipperary. Son of Timothy and Anastasia Conway and brother to 6 siblings, 5 brothers and 1 sister. Mr William Conway was a member of the Irish Republican Army and among the founders of the Young Ireland Hurling Club.
Background.
His father was a farmer. William Conway joined the IRA as a member of the North Tipperary IRA from 1917 to 1919. He came to Dublin and worked as a barman with his brother James near Lower Mount Street where they rented a place. Once in Dublin, he joined the branch of G Company 3rd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. While working in Mount Street and met Sean Hyde who came into his shop. They discussed the spies, or the Murder Gang, on Mount Street.
Bloody Sunday (22 Lower Mount Street).
On 22 November 1921, his lodgings were raided by the military over the Bloody Sunday murders. The raiding party found pamphlets (illegal) a first aid kit, filed dressings, some maps, and a compass. He was arrested with his brother Jim and taken to the bridewell RIC barracks.
During a police lineup on 1 December he was identified by Nellie Stapleton, a witness and maid at 22 Lower Mount Street, as being one of the people she saw during the assassination of Lieutenant Angliss. He was charged with Murder.
On 15 December he was taken to Kilmainham Gaol along with 3 other suspects Frank Teeling, Edward Potter, and Daniel Healy.
Kilmainham Gaol escape.
On the night of 14 February 1921, a daring escape from Kilmainham Gaol was masterminded by Michael Collins and his command. Frank Teeling, Ernie O’Malley, and Simon Donnelly escaped from the Gaol on the pretext of a transfer order, and after some guards were bribed. After Frank Teeling escaped, William Conway, who said he was in the cell next door told of the incident is a letter to the pensions board statement, that he took Frank Teeling's overcoat from his cell when he heard that bloodhounds were being brought in to search for the prisoners; thus removing the scent for the dogs. Following the prisoner escape by Frank Teeling from Kilmainham Jail on 14 February, the Under Secretary James MacMahon hastily arranged under curfew, for the transfer of 24 high risk prisoners including Conway to Mountjoy Jail during the night of 16 February 1921.
Lower Mount Street trial.
The Bloody Sunday trial
for the Lower Mount Street murders began on the 25 January 1921, and ended on 31 January.
The whole of Ireland were enthralled by the trial with most Irish newspapers and international newspapers reporting it.
During the trial William Conway vigorously protested his innocence saying that he was at 9am Sunday mass in Westmoreland Street. One controversial thing came to light recently when a lawyer for the defence, Vincent Rice, wrote to the Bureau of Military history stating that a witness had seen Conway with his brother at about 8.50am walking on the way to mass. This statement was not shared by the prosecution at the time.
William Conway was convicted of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss along with Frank Teeling, and Edward Potter. Two of the defendants were identified by a witness, a British Army Lieutenant called Mr. "C". The 3 were given sentences of death by hanging. Daniel Healy was tried separately and was found not guilty.
Parliamentary Pressure.
A parliamentary question was asked by William Lunn MP in the House of Commons, with regard to doubts about William Conway's (and Edward Potter) conviction for the murder of Lieutenant Angliss. This being due to the two witnesses being of unreliable character. Mr. Lunn asked the Chief Secretary whether William Conway and Edward Potter were convicted of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss on the evidence of two witnesses; whether one of these witnesses was a servant in the house, whose account of the tragedy was excusably confused and contradictory; whether the other witness admitted that he was frequently drunk; whether he had been charged with disorderly conduct and also with assault and obscene language; and whether he had previously identified as having been concerned with the murder of Lieutenant Angliss two men who were subsequently proved to have been in gaol at the time? 
A second parliamentary question was asked by John Swan MP to the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, about the 15 witnesses at Conway's trial who were brought forward to prove William Conway's alibi that he was not present during the murder of Lieutenant Angliss on 20 November 1920.
Mr. John Swan MP
asked the Chief Secretary "whether at the court-martial which convicted Conway and Potter of the murder of Lieutenant Angliss 15 witnesses were brought to prove an alibi for Conway and seven to prove that Potter was in bed at the time?"
Sir. Hamar Greenwood (the Chief Secretary of Ireland)
"The answer is in the affirmative."
Over a month later, William Conway and Edward Potter had their sentences commuted to penal servitude on 6 March 1921. He was later transferred to various prisons in England, including Dartmoor, Portland, and Frongoch in Wales.
Aftermath.
Following the amnesty of December 1921 he returned to Ireland. As an early member of the GAA he remained a faithful organiser of the Irish National sport. Notably he was also a playing member of Faughs and Grocer's Club.
The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave attended his burial at Deans Grange Cemetery in 1976. William Conway was given full military honours with a 21 gun salute from the Irish Army at his funeral.

Mark Protheroe

Mark Protheroe (born 5 March 1971) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s. He played most of his career at the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, but he also played for South Queensland Crushers. He started his career on the , but he later shifted to the forwards playing mostly in the .
Playing career.
A Brisbane junior, Protheroe started his rugby league career in 1990 playing for QRL side Redcliffe Dolphins in the Brisbane competition. In 1991, Protheroe along with Redcliffe coach Mark Murray were signed by the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Protheroe made his first grade debut in his sides' 16-10 loss to arch rivals the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the Sydney Football Stadium in the opening round of the 1991 season. Despite a poor season from the Roosters in which they finished in 11th position, Protheroe had a brilliant rookie season, he played in 20 of his sides' 22 games and scored 7 tries. Protheroe narrowly missed out on winning the Dally M award for Rookie of the Year. Instead Will Robinson of the Balmain Tigers won the award.
More success followed Protheroe in the 1992 season, despite the Roosters narrowly missing out on finals qualification for the first time since 1987, finishing in 6th position, Protheroe starred, playing in all 22 games and scoring 6 tries. For his efforts, Protheroe was considered for the Queensland side in the 1992 State of Origin series, however Protheroe ultimately missed out on selection when Adrian Brunker and Michael Hancock were instead chosen as the wingers. Protheroe played his first match in the forwards when he was chosen at second-row in round 17 of the 1993 season, he would play most of his later career in this position. After disappointing seasons in 1993, 1994, and 1995 in which the Roosters finished 8th, 14th, and 9th respectively, Protheroe decided to leave the Roosters at the end of the 1995 season and returned to Brisbane.
In 1996, after five seasons in Sydney with the Roosters, Protheroe returned to Brisbane, this time to play for the South Queensland Crushers. He along with fellow Roosters Nigel Gaffey, Jason Hudson, Graham Mackay and Clinton O'Brien joined the ill-fated Crushers. Despite having a relatively strong playing roster which included these players as well as former Origin players Terry Cook, Trevor Gillmeister and Tony Hearn, the Crushers finished with the wooden spoon in both the 1996 and 1997 seasons. With the demise of the Crushers at the end of the 1997 season, Protheroe decided to retire from playing. He finished his career having played 123 games and scoring 33 tries. After the demise of the Crushers, Protheroe would play one final season with Queensland Cup side Norths Devils in 1998, before retiring for good at season's end. The Devils won their first First Grade premiership since 1980 beating Wests Panthers in the Grand Final.

Margarethe von Reinken

Margarethe von Reinken (27 March 1877 - 20 January 1962) was a German painter. She was known chiefly for still lifes, landscapes and portraiture.
Life.
Margarethe Diederike von Reinken was born in Bremen, the youngest of her parents' eight children. Her father, Daniel von Reinken (1831–1894), came from a leading family of Bremen merchants.
While her father's business was still flourishing she was enrolled at the newly established so-called in Karlsruhe, where she was taught by Friedrich Fehr and Ludwig Schmid-Reutte. She returned home to Bremen to launch herself as a freelance artist, setting up a studio at her widowed mother's house in the . She hoped to establish herself through contract work, focusing on portraits. Despite the acknowledged excellence of her draftsmanship and her good social contacts, she struggled financially at a time when the economy was undergoing a lengthy period of major structural dislocation. Around 1900 she also came into contact with the nearby . Her work was influenced members of it including Fritz Overbeck and Heinrich Vogeler. Several of her oil painted landscapes of nature and the countryside round Worpswede date from these early years of the twentieth century.
After the war her economic situation became more dire and she was no longer able to fall back on the family wealth, which was largely destroyed by the hyper-inflation of the period. With her elder sisters having married and set up their own homes, she was also, as the spinster daughter, expected to take care of her mother. Meanwhile, she remained in close contact with other local artists such as August Tolkien and Toni Elster with whom, in 1924, she staged a "collective" exhibition at the Bremen Kunsthalle art museum. Von Reinken was now also supplementing her income by teaching. Two of her pupils who later established significant artistic careers of their own were Agnes Sander-Plump and Gustava Thölken.
During the later 1920s she visited her elder sister Daniele, who had emigrated from Bremen to Brazil. In 1926 she painted several views of Rio and various mountain landscape sketches which are now in the possession of the family in São Paulo. Back in Bremen, in 1930 she was one of the very few women whose works were included at that year's exhibition. Meanwhile she accepted the offer of friend to work for their family as a housekeeper. She kept the job for 17 years. She was able to use a room in the family home which she could use as a studio, but time available for painting was limited. She was nevertheless able to create a significant number of paintings for sale and exhibitions, her work included in a number of subsequent exhibitions in Bremen, as a result of which her work remains represented in collections and galleries in and around Bremen.
In 1947 moved to a house owned by the Meta von Post Foundation in Bremen-Horn where she lived out her final fifteen years. A substantial retrospective exhibition of her work took place at the Bremen Kunsthalle art museum during the second quarter of 1994, featuring her paintings, water-colours and drawings. , director of the museum, paid tribute to her "perfect pitch" ("absolutes Gehör") in terms of colour and commended her "artistic sense of responsibility ... in respect of her critical self-appraisal". He added, "she did not allow her paintings to become superficial or frivolous. She tried to exclude from her art anything approximate or imprecise".

Jewish Maternity Hospital

Jewish Maternity Hospital was an obstetrics hospital located at 270-272 East Broadway, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City.
History.
Jewish Maternity Hospital was chartered in 1906 and opened on February 15, 1909. It catered to the Jewish residents of the Lower East Side, who were the overwhelmingly predominant local population at the time, although expectant mothers of any religion were accepted.
In its first 20 years of operation, 31,295 babies were born at Jewish Maternity Hospital.
The hospital merged administratively with Beth Israel Hospital on December 19, 1929. Beth Israel was in financial straits because of cost overruns on a new building under construction at Stuyvesant Square, and Jewish Maternity Hospital had money available for their own construction plans. When Beth Israel finished their construction in 1931, Jewish Maternity Hospital also moved to the site. Both institutions’ names were kept for some time after the merger, but the Jewish Maternity Hospital name was eventually replaced by the Beth Israel name for all obstetrical services.
Legacy.
The building on the Lower East Side continued to be used for outpatient services, and was sold in 1943 to the Home of the Sages of Israel, a retirement home for rabbis located next door to the former hospital building. The structures were then combined and remodeled into an expanded retirement home.
The successor maternity services at Beth Israel Hospital continued to operate for several decades, but were closed on June 11, 2017, as part of that hospital's downsizing.

Lithuanian Regions Party

The Lithuanian Regions Party (, LRP), also translated as the Lithuanian Party of Regions, is a social-democratic political party in Lithuania. It was founded in 2018 as the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (, LSDDP) following a split of members from Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP; also joined by former members of the Labour Party) following the LSDP's decision to exit a coalition government with the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union in 2017.
History.
The party was a junior partner in government in the Seimas, Lithuania's unicameral Parliament, from 2018 to 2020. LSDDP has 50 sections.
The party scored badly in the 2019 European Parliament election, scoring only 2.4% of votes and failing to elect any MEP. The party won slightly over 3% of the popular vote and 3 seats in the 2020 parliamentary election (only one MP, Andrius Palionis, was reelected). By this, the party became eligible to state dotation.
In July 2021 the party adopted the name Lithuanian Regions Party, aligning with the new Lithuanian Group of Regions () parliamentary group.

Early life.

Career.
Nimal made his career debut with "Nufoozu" (1984), an initiation by Shareef and his colleagues. Initially assigned to work behind the camera, Shareef requested him to star in the lead role of the film due to a date conflict of the original actor who was offered the role first.

European 112 Day

European 112 Day is an international day that is annually held on 11 February. It was introduced by the European Union and aims to promote the existence and appropriate use of the Europe-wide emergency number 112.
The Europe-wide emergency call.
In addition to the national emergency telephone numbers, the Europe-wide emergency telephone number 112 was introduced in 1991 in order to make a common emergency call available in every member state of the European Union. Since December 2008, the emergency call services can be reached from all fixed and mobile networks and free of charges with the common telephone number 112. Due to the rising publicity of 112 as the European emergency number, it is turning into a common symbol of help and support, but also of the European Union in general.
Origins.
The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission signed a tripartite convention in 2009 in order to introduce an annual European 112-day. It is supposed to raise awareness for the Europe-wide availability and the advantages of the European emergency call 112. They chose 11 February since the date includes the telephone number (11/2). The idea of dedicating one particular day to the European emergency call had been first discussed in the European Parliament in 2007 in the context of the preparations of the Declaration of the European Parliament on the European emergency call number 112.
The overall necessity of increasing the awareness level of the European emergency number has been confirmed by the Flash Eurobarometer 228 from February 2008: Only 22% of all respondents, on EU-average, knew that the emergency telephone number 112 is valid and available in the entire European Union. Merely 6% in the United Kingdom and 14% in Ireland were aware of this fact. This impression was further affirmed in 2009 (EU-average 24%, United Kingdom 8%, Ireland 9%) and 2010 (EU-average 25%, United Kingdom 8%, Ireland 18%) with minor increases.
Celebration.
A lot of actions are taking place around Europe every year to celebrate European 112 Day. Some are organized by politicians and government officials, other by rescue services, firefighters and Non-governmental organizations. In 2018, a whole variety of events dedicated to the common European emergency call were arranged in at least 23 member states of the European Union as well as in Georgia, Kosovo and Iceland.
In Germany, the supercentenarian Edelgard Huber von Gersdorff, who is 112 years old and currently the oldest German woman, became honorary patroness of the campaign "One Europe – one number!", which aims at raising awareness for the European Emergency Number 112. In Belgium, the Manneken Pis, one of the most well-known landmarks of Brussels, was dressed up in a costume with the European flag and the number 112 on it by the campaign "European Emergency Number Association". In Ireland, the emergency number was promoted at the annual Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition by the Emergency Call Answering Service (ECAS). Many other representatives and associations of national emergency rescue services, like the National Federation of Firefighters of France (FNSPF), the Fire and Rescue Service of Latvia and the Luxembourg Rescue Services Agency, took different actions in order to educate the general public about the significance and the appropriate use of the European emergency call.
European 112 Day 2018 has also been a major subject in the social media; with hashtags like #112day2018 and #Isupport112 going viral.
In 2021, the campaign aimed to thank the emergency services for their unconditional work. The hashtags #112Day2021 and #thankyouchain went viral on social networks and were a trend on Twitter all day.

Ibrahim Jihad

Ibrahim Jihad is a Maldivian actor.
Career.
Abdul Faththaah's horror film "Eynaa" was released in 2004, which appears Sheela Najeeb, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Shah, Khadheeja Ibrahim Didi, Jihad and Nashidha Mohamed as six colleagues who go on a picnic to a haunted uninhabited island and their battle for survival. The film garnered critical appreciation specially for its technical department and was a commercial success. The following year, Jihad reunited with Abdul Faththaah for his romantic disaster film, "Hureemey Inthizaarugaa" (2005) cast along with Ravee Farooq, Mariyam Zuhura, Waleedha Waleed and Neena Saleem. The film, heavily relied on the effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives, received favorable reviews from critics though it failed to perform financially. Jihad played the envious brother who is ready to go extreme extent to destroy's his brother's career and life.
In 2011, Jihad featured as the police officer Shavin in Yoosuf Shafeeu-directed action drama film "Insaaf" (2011). The film revolves around the disputes between two districts of an island. Upon release, the film received mixed to positive reviews from critics but it failed to be recognized financially. Mohamed Aboobakuru-directed "Randhari" was Jihad's only release of 2015. His portrayal of the character Waseem, along with the film received negative reviews from critics and did below average business at the box office. The following year, he played the role of Muju, a thief who gets trapped in a haunted house along with a group of friends, in Fathimath Nahula's horror film "4426". Upon release, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem of "Avas" labelled the film as a "masterpiece" and noted his character to be the "catalyst" of the film. His character along with his performance was widely appreciated considering it to be "once in a lifetime" performance. With twenty-five back-to-back housefull shows being screened, "4426" was declared as the highest-grossing film of the year. At the 8th Gaumee Film Awards Jihad received a nomination for Best Actor award.
Jihad's only release of 2017 was Aishath Rishmy's romantic drama "Bos". Penned and produced by Fathimath Nahula, the film tells the story of Ibaa (played by Mariyam Azza), a woman from a royal family and her battle with depression after the demise of her father. A reviewer from "Avas" criticise the film for having resemblance with American coming-of-age romantic drama "A Walk to Remember" (2002) and Indian romantic drama "Sanam Teri Kasam" (2016), however considered Jihad's performance and "perfect portrayal" of his character as the few things that saved the film from being a "snooze-fest". Though the film received mixed response from critics, it emerged as the highest grossing Maldivian film of 2017.
2018 was a dull year for Maldivian film-industry with regards to 2018 Maldivian presidential election, hence only one film of Jihad was released during the year; a suspense thriller film "Dhevansoora" (2018) written and directed by Yoosuf Shafeeu. The film marks Shafeeu's thirtieth direction and features an ensemble cast of twenty-one actors. Revolving around a murder investigating, Jihad played a police officer trying to solve the murder mystery. The film received positive reviews from critics and was considered a "norm-breaker" for the Maldivian cinema. Ahmed Hameed Adam reviewing from VNews applauded Jihad's performance as he maintained "vulnerability and ruthlessness in a stable manner while emoting for the grief of his lost-child in the perfect way". Ismail Nail Rasheed from Raajje.mv echoed similar sentiments towards his acting and wrote: "Jihad's character was faced with a formal yet personal conflict and he delivered the best expressions during each phase". He then starred in the first Maldivian web-series, a romantic drama by Fathimath Nahula, "Huvaa". The series consisting of sixty episodes and streamed through the digital platform Baiskoafu, centers around a happy and radiant family which breaks into despairing pieces after a tragic incident that led to an unaccountable loss. The series and his performance as a spoiled carefree young man entrapped in a sin he was hoping to evade were positively received.

2017 New York City transit crisis

In 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) due to ongoing reliability and crowding problems with mass transit in New York City. This order applied particularly to the New York City Subway, which was the most severely affected by dilapidated infrastructure, causing overcrowding and delays. With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration could be seen in many subway stations. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since a transit crisis in the 1970s. To a lesser extent, New York City buses operated by the MTA were also affected. Both the subway and the buses are run by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a subsidiary of the MTA. A separate crisis at Penn Station affected the routes of the three railroad agencies that provided service into the station. Media outlets deemed these crises "the summer of hell".
There were myriad causes attributed to the transit crisis. The subway was affected by a lack of funds, signal slowdowns, and broken-down infrastructure. The buses were also affected by a lack of funds, but individual routes had additional problems including low frequencies, slow speeds, and winding routes. Money from the MTA in general was withheld due to actions from politicians at both the city and state levels, from both the Democratic Party and Republican Party. These issues caused delays for passengers for both systems, ranging from moderate to severe, as well as resulted in thousands of hours of lost time for passengers. Additionally, ridership on the subway started declining for the first time in several years, and ridership on buses continued a gradual decline that had started before the crisis.
Several solutions were proposed. In July 2017, MTA chairman Joe Lhota created a multifaceted "Subway Action Plan" that consisted of short- and long-term solutions. A corresponding "Bus Action Plan" was released in April 2018. Later that year, the Regional Plan Association released a report that advocated for large investments to the subway system. The MTA hired Andy Byford as the new NYCTA chief in 2018; Byford presented a report to tackle the issues plaguing the transit system before his resignation two years later. Service improved through 2019, but the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in early 2020 further depleted the MTA's finances. Governor Cuomo also proposed implementing congestion pricing in New York City to fund the MTA, which was approved in 2021. 
Declaration of crisis.
On June 27, 2017, thirty-nine people were injured when an A train derailed at 125th Street because the emergency brakes were activated after the train hit an improperly secured piece of replacement rail. The next day, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the subway system. This state of emergency had also arisen after several track fires and overcrowding incidents. As part of the order, he ordered MTA Chairman Joe Lhota to come up with a reorganization plan within 30 days. A day later, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock. The winner of each of the three challenges was to receive a million dollars and have their idea implemented systemwide.
At Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan, a separate transit crisis developed because Amtrak had postponed the maintenance of infrastructure around the station, which was the nation's busiest. In early 2017, this culminated in numerous power outages, derailments, and delays due to track maintenance. There were frequent service disruptions to Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit train schedules caused by the deterioration of its tracks and their supporting infrastructure, as well as in those of the East River and North River Tunnels that respectively connect the station to Long Island and New Jersey.
During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has control of the subway system. Cuomo claimed that since the subway system was owned by New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had to pay more for its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion contribution was enough. On July 21, the second set of wheels on a southbound Q train jumped the track near Brighton Beach, constituting the system's second derailment within a month. Nine people suffered injuries due to improper maintenance of the car in question.
Causes.
Lack of funds.
On November 18, 2017, "The New York Times" published its investigation into the crisis, with over 1,000 readers having submitted stories about the effects of the past year's subway delays. It found that politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties, at the mayoral and gubernatorial levels, had gradually removed $1.5 billion of MTA funding. The "Times" stressed that no single event directly caused the crisis; rather, it was an accumulation of small cutbacks and maintenance deferments. "The New York Times" described MTA funds as a "piggy bank" for the state, with the issuance of MTA bonds benefiting the state at the MTA's expense. By 2017, a sixth of the MTA's budget was allocated to paying off debt, a threefold increase from the proportion in 1997. The city's $250 million annual contribution to the MTA budget in 2017 was a quarter of the contribution in 1990.
This lack of funds was not only due to the gradual reduction of funding. Other actions by city and state politicians, according to the "Times", included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians' other interventions. In December of the same year, the "Times" reported that the $12 billion East Side Access project, which would extend the MTA's Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal upon its completion, was the most expensive of its kind in the world, with a projected price of $3.5 billion per mile ( billion per kilometer) of track. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. In addition to overpaying workers and overspending, politicians and trade unions had forced the MTA to hire more workers than was needed. In 2010, an accountant found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the Second Avenue Subway and 7 Subway Extension, had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA.
Signal and work-zone slowdowns.
The transit crisis was influenced partly by modifications to New York City Subway signals and work-zone policies that forced trains to reduce their average speeds. After a collision between two trains on the Williamsburg Bridge in 1995, in which a train operator was killed after speeding his train into the back of another, the MTA modified both signals and trains to lower their average speeds. Trains' maximum speeds were physically limited, while some signals were modified to prevent trains from proceeding through a certain signal block before a minimum time had elapsed. These signals, referred to as "time signals", forced operators to slow train speeds so that they would only pass through the signal block after the timer elapsed. Some of these time signals malfunctioned: they prevented trains from passing even if the operator had slowed down the train to the speed that was indicated, and so some operators slowed trains further in case a time signal forced trains to wait for longer than was indicated. This resulted in overcrowded trains, since fewer trains per hour were able to proceed on certain sections of track. By 2012, over 1,200 signals had been modified, and by 2018, that number had grown to 1,800. Exacerbating the signal problems, some of the oldest block signals in the system were 80 years old , and they also broke down frequently.
Subway trains were also forced to slow down due to work-zone rules. These rules were created by a task force, which was implemented in 2007 after a series of worker deaths. Prior to 2007, even if one track was out of service, trains on adjacent tracks could operate at normal speeds. Under the new rules, if a track was directly adjacent to a track in a work-zone, trains on the adjacent track also had to slow down to 10 miles per hour or less. As a result, the proportion of delays caused by track work increased by 10% between 2013 and 2014, even though there were roughly the same number of track work in both years.
Bus problems.
A corresponding bus crisis was not covered as heavily in the media. However, in November 2017, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer identified several causes for the bus system's unreliability. In the report, he wrote that almost half of all bus routes ran low frequencies in one or both directions of travel during rush hours. He also said that many bus routes were vulnerable to "bus bunching", where several buses travel the same route in quick succession. The average speeds of New York City buses were found to be , the slowest of any major bus system nationwide. Additionally, Stringer wrote that long, winding bus routes caused bus speeds to slow down.
Effects.
Even before the crisis, every non-shuttle subway route's on-time performance had declined: in 2007, all of these routes had over 70% on-time performance, arriving at the last station within five minutes of the timetable, but in 2017, only three routes could claim that distinction. The least reliable route, the 2 train, reached its terminus on-schedule only 32% of the time. The subway's 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities' transit systems, ranking behind the Hong Kong MTR (100%), Seoul Metropolitan Subway (99%), San Francisco's BART (86%), and Mexico City Metro (71%). David L. Gunn, who helped end the 1980s transit crisis when he led the NYCTA in the mid-1980s, described the 2017 crisis as "heartbreaking".
In August 2017, "The New York Times" released an article about how the routes that serve the Lexington Avenue Line (the ) failed to meet its schedule count during weekday rush hours when demand is at its highest. A study conducted on weekdays between June 9 and July 31 by the MTA revealed about 14% of the trains that were scheduled to pass through the Grand Central–42nd Street station during rush hours never came. During the time this study was conducted, the closest the line ever came to meeting its printed schedule was 88 out of 90 trains during the a.m. rush hour, and 83 out of 88 trains during the p.m. rush hour. Officials have often blamed overcrowding for the reasons why trains are canceled, and Chairman Lhota has stated that maintaining space between trains was more of a priority for him than meeting the schedules was. However, overcrowding was really an effect, rather than a cause, of delays. Although average weekday ridership stayed largely constant from 2012 to 2018, the number of delays attributed to overcrowding increased, even as the number of other types of delays did not change by much.
In October 2017, Comptroller Stringer released an analysis of the effect of subway delays on the economy and on commuters. The study found that based on a normal wait time of 5 minutes and an average wage of $34 per hour in 2016, "worst-case" subway delays of more than 20 minutes could cost up to $389 million annually in lost productivity. By comparison, "mid-case" delays of between 10 and 20 minutes could cost $243.1 million per year, and "best-case" delays of between 5 and 10 minutes could cost $170.2 million per year. Passengers on the 5 train suffered the greatest wage loss from worst-case delays, while passengers on the 7 train lost the most wages from medium- and best-case delays.
As a result of the maintenance crisis, weekday subway ridership started declining for the first time in several years. Despite a 1.1% increase in the number of jobs in the city between September 2016 and September 2017, weekday ridership declined 1.4% and weekend ridership declined 1.0%. With 5.712 million average weekday riders in September 2017, this translated to about 105,000 fewer riders per weekday. Even during the previous year, when the subway as a whole saw a 0.3% decrease in annual ridership—marking the first such decrease since 2009—weekday ridership had risen by about 0.1%. Bus ridership also maintained a continuing decrease. One hundred million fewer riders rode MTA buses in 2017 than in 2008. Rider complaints on social media intensified during the crisis: by mid-2018, there were 2,500 daily complaints to the MTA's and subway's Twitter accounts.
By January 2018, average weekday on-time performance had dropped from 65% to 58.1%, and there were more than 76,000 delayed trains. The delayed trains were defined as those that had reached their terminus at least five minutes later than what was listed on the timetable. Of these, over 10,000 trains, or 14%, had been delayed for unknown causes. Exacerbating the situation, the MTA incorrectly classified the causes of the unknown delays under one of the fourteen known categories of delays, classifying equal amounts of "unknown delays" under each category. It was so common for subway trains to be delayed that many commuters rearranged their schedules around the subway, traveling earlier than usual to factor in any potential subway delays.
Short-term solutions.
After a particularly bad round of delays in May 2017, the MTA devised a "six-point plan" to reduce subway delays. It planned to hasten the delivery of new R211 cars; perform testing on boarding and alighting patterns at stations; post emergency medical technicians at key stations to treat sick passengers; double the frequency of the monthly track-defect detection tests; reduce bottlenecks at junctions; and reorganize the leadership hierarchy. The plan would cost $20 million and be implemented at 21 stations as a trial: nineteen stations on the heavily used IND Eighth Avenue Line between 125th Street and Fulton Street, as well as the 149th Street–Grand Concourse and Third Avenue–138th Street stations in the Bronx. These locations were chosen since they were the source of frequent bottlenecks. On the Eighth Avenue Line especially, there are an average of 25 subway-car breakdowns per month, with the average such delay lasting 19 minutes. The EMTs would be posted in five Eighth Avenue Line stations: 125th Street, 59th Street, 14th Street, West Fourth Street, and Fulton Street. There would also be an increased police presence. The improved boarding and alighting patterns might include color-coded platforms and subway cars, as well as additional signage. Finally, there would be a new chairman position to be split off of the existing CEO position. Transit commentators viewed the plan positively, regarding the plan as a small step toward increasing the subway's reliability.
Also in May, Amtrak announced that it would perform some track maintenance around Penn Station over a period of one and a half months in summer 2017. Five tracks were closed for repairs as part of the reconstruction work, severely reducing track capacity in a situation media outlets deemed "the summer of hell". Many affected NJ Transit passengers were diverted to take the PATH instead. Regular service resumed on September 5, 2017.
On July 25, Chairman Lhota announced a two-phase, $9 billion New York City Subway Action Plan to stabilize the subway system and to prevent the continuing decline of the system. It expanded on the six-point plan elaborated on in May. The $836 million first phase, to be effective immediately, focused on "stabilization". It consisted of five categories. The first, Signal and Track Maintenance, included creating new crews to repair infrastructure more efficiently, adding continuously welded rail to more tracks, repairing 1,300 broken signals, cleaning 40,000 storm grates, and hiring 2,700 workers to repair broken signals and tracks more quickly. The second, Car Reliability, would put emphasis on maintaining car doors in a more timely fashion, add cars to trains on the C route, remove seats from 42nd Street Shuttle and L train cars to increase capacity, and put emergency car-repair teams at select locations, among other things. The third, System Safety and Cleanliness, would increase the number of key stations with emergency medical technicians, maintain elevators and escalators efficiently, clean stations and repair components more frequently, add public service announcements warning against littering, and collaborate with the NYPD to enforce the law within the subway. The fourth, Customer Communication, entailed launching a dedicated MTA app; creating better announcements during service disruptions; and completing the installation of systemwide countdown clocks; while the fifth category, Critical Management Group, would consolidate operations and hire people to resolve incidents quickly. The $8 billion second phase would implement the winning proposals from the Genius Transit Challenge and fix more widespread problems.
On July 27, two days after the release of the Action Plan, Governor Cuomo announced that his administration was working on a way for private sponsors to "adopt a station" for up to $600,000. The sponsors would be partially responsible for their station's aesthetics. City officials announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would push for a tax on wealthy New York City residents to help pay for necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 million of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line—a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, it would have to be approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, as the State Legislature would not go back into session until January 2018.
In October 2017, as part of the action plan, a hundred R160 subway cars on the E train were retrofitted to provide extra capacity of 8 to 10 passengers per car, and some older R46 cars were also similarly refurbished. Additionally, officials started piloting a new fare system compatible with the LIRR and Metro-North's eTix electronic tickets, and several unspecified L train cars were being retrofitted with seats that folded up during rush hours. Officials also changed all announcements containing "ladies and gentlemen" and replaced them with the more general terms "passengers", "riders", and "everyone", using gender-neutral terms to improve passenger service.
Long-term solutions and proposals.
In August 2017, Governor Cuomo drafted a proposal for congestion pricing in New York City, with the primary intent of raising funds for city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. In October, the New York State Government created a task force, Fix NYC, to find solutions for fixing mass transit and lowering congestion. A preliminary proposal was released in January 2018, although a final plan remains in debate. Mayor de Blasio, who initially opposed the congestion pricing plan, suggested a counter-proposal to raise taxes for the city's wealthiest residents.
Coinciding with the transit crisis, the Regional Plan Association released its fourth Regional Plan on November 30, 2017, marking the first such plan since 1996. The plan, which had been prepared over the previous five years, suggested three changes for the subway system. The first suggestion was constructing eight subway lines in all four boroughs. The second suggestion was to modernize the system by shutting it down completely during weekday nights; renovating subway stations to include such amenities as elevators and platform screen doors; and reducing crowding, heat, noise, and pollutant levels in stations. The final suggestion was to accelerate the automation of the New York City Subway. The RPA has historically published many proposals that have been implemented, unlike other regional planning associations, whose plans are typically ignored.
Improvements were also proposed for the bus system. These improvements included adding more bus lanes in New York City, which allow buses to use an exclusive bus lane without being blocked by other traffic. Traffic signal preemption, which changes traffic lights based on whether a bus is approaching, was also suggested for 1,000 traffic signals by 2020. In October 2017, de Blasio's administration announced that the city would add 21 Select Bus Service routes through 2027, adding to the existing 15-route system. The Select Bus Service lines implemented several methods to speed up service: passengers paid fares at booths on the sidewalk rather than aboard buses using all-door boarding, and the buses themselves used exclusive bus lanes. In April 2018, the MTA published a Bus Action Plan detailing 28 suggestions to improve the bus system. The improvements included expanding all-door boarding to all bus routes; simplifying bus routes; adding more dedicated bus lanes; enforcing bus lane rules; redesigning borough bus maps; purchasing more electric buses; and adding real-time boarding information to buses. The MTA also planned to test out a double-decker bus on the redesigned Staten Island bus routes.
New President.
The MTA hired Andy Byford as the president of the New York City Transit Authority in November 2017. Previously CEO at the Toronto Transit Commission, Byford assumed his new position in January 2018. MTA leadership expected that Byford would be able to devise solutions to fix the NYCTA's reliability issues, particularly those of the subway. Within the first few months of his job, Byford was devising long-term plans for the bus and subway systems.
Genius Transit Challenge.
On May 23, 2017, Governor Cuomo officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock. The winner of each of the three challenges was to receive a million dollars and have their idea implemented systemwide, though MTA employees were outright prohibited from applying. The program drew criticism from industry observers and MTA staff, as it created the perception that outside input was more valued by sheer virtue of coming from outside the agency, rather than any relevant industry experience, such as that of career transportation professionals who actually worked at the agency. The program was marketed to the tech industry and business professionals with little to no transit expertise, and was generally not promoted to private practitioners or researchers within the transportation industry itself. Nineteen finalists for the Genius Transit Challenge were announced in December 2017, out of 438 applicants from 23 countries. Most were established corporations such as Alstom, AECOM, Nokia, and MTA's cellular-service provider Transit Wireless, although two finalists were individual applicants. Six winning submissions from eight entities were announced in March 2018.
Fast Forward report.
Byford announced his subway and bus modernization plan at a MTA board meeting in May 2018. The plan involved upgrading signals on the subway system's five most heavily used physical lines; making 50 extra stations ADA-accessible; and installing an automatic train supervision system for routes that did not already have that system, which would help monitor train locations. The bus system would be streamlined and reorganized to make the service more reliable. The plan would cost $43 billion over 15 years, including an initial expenditure of $19 billion over the first five years.
Ten lines would receive automated signaling system by 2028. In addition to increase capacity, and to reduce reliance on important interlockings, potential route changes will be evaluated. Also part of the plan was a new fare payment system that was to be implemented by 2020, as well as 3,650 new subway cars to be ordered by 2028, including 650 cars to be ordered by 2023. The program to add 50 more ADA-accessible stations during the 2020–2024 Capital Program would allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops, and it would be more than double the 19 stations outlined in the then-current 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program. Byford's May 2018 proposal also included suggestions to improve the bus system. As part of the plan, the Staten Island express bus and Bronx local bus network would be re-evaluated, and bus priority measures would be added and enforced. Bus stops would be consolidated for faster service, and existing bus stops would be improved with bus shelters and real-time travel information. In order to get the MTA to work more efficiently, employee communications, processes, and hierarchies would also be reorganized. Conditions at stations will be improved through the appointment of "group station managers" to stations within a geographic area.
In order to keep trains moving, New York City Transit started evaluating twenty places where signal timers affect service the most. Some of the locations included the IRT Lexington Avenue Line () between 14th Street–Union Square and Bowling Green; the IRT Eastern Parkway Line () between Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center and Franklin Avenue; the IND Fulton Street Line () between Jay Street–MetroTech and Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets; and the BMT Jamaica Line and BMT Nassau Street Line () between Hewes Street and Bowery. Signal timers were added across the system since the fatal 1995 Williamsburg Bridge subway crash, so that trains would be spaced further apart, thereby increasing safety. Some timers were installed in places where extra train spacing was unnecessary, increasing delays and reducing capacity. In addition, some timers had stopped functioning properly, forcing train operators to operate more slowly to ensure that their train did not activate the automatic braking system if they passed the signals at too high a speed. As part of Byford's plan, New York City Transit would ensure that signal timers are being cleaned and are functioning. In fall 2018, two new initiatives would begin on selected lines to reduce delays. The first initiative would ensure that train crews will be at the terminal to allow their train to leave on time, while the second would add countdown clocks for train operators so they can maintain speeds.
Under the "Fast Forward" report, New York City Transit would conduct a one-year pilot program in which it would increase off-peak bus frequencies on the Q6, Q69, B17, B65, and S93 bus routes in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. These improvements would be implemented between September 2018 and January 2019. The Bx6 local bus route in the Bronx would also get articulated buses by January 2019 in order to increase passenger capacity. A separate program would involve removing every other stop on the Q22 route in Queens, as well as adjust schedules and short turn certain bus trips based on demand, in order to increase bus reliability. The Q22 changes would become effective in September 2018.
Long-term effects.
2018 developments.
The newly reorganized Staten Island express bus network went into effect on August 19, 2018. On August 20, the first weekday that the new bus network was in effect, commuters reported overcrowding on some bus routes and at the Eltingville Transit Center, while four experimental park-and-ride routes were largely unused. The following day, Andy Byford held the first town hall for the Fast Forward plan at York College in Jamaica, Queens. It was one of several such meetings scheduled for the plan. In internal emails released the same month, the MTA indicated that as a result of budget cuts, some subway staffing and car-cleaning jobs might be eliminated. In addition, the expansion of Select Bus Service in the outer boroughs might be halted until 2021 while the city's bus network was being re-evaluated.
In the MTA's September 2018 board meeting, Byford stated that the subway was getting better. He said that in 2018, there were fewer major incidents that delayed 50 or more trains compared to in 2017, and the mean distance between failures (MDBF) for trains was higher than in the previous year. However, these figures included major-incident rates that were far above average in January 2018, and the MDBF figures in 2018 were much lower than in 2015. The transit advocacy group Riders Alliance stated that in August 2018, there was only one weekday where the subway system did not experience delays due to signal or equipment malfunctions. Subway trains had a 68% on-time rate in summer 2018; such a low reliability metric had not been seen since the 1970s transit crisis. Byford also stated that, thus far, the MTA had cleaned of track, fixed 1,300 signals, and modified 1,600 subway cars as part of the Fast Forward plan. At a subsequent event, Byford announced that 23 "group station managers" had been hired to manage groups of up to 25 stations each.
In October 2018, New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli published a report stating that the MTA could have $42 billion in debt by 2022. This was exacerbated by the declines in subway and bus ridership, which could not be offset by higher fares alone. Standard &amp; Poor's had already reduced the MTA's credit rating and bond rating from an A+ to an A earlier that year because of the MTA's financial issues and political infighting. Also that October, the MTA launched another competition, this one targeted toward technology companies. There were two challenges: one to reduce traffic congestion along bus routes, and one to predict and alleviate subway delays. With the upcoming 14th Street Tunnel shutdown starting in April 2019, which would suspend service on the to Manhattan for a year, the MTA and New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) finalized their mitigation plans for the shutdown. However, the mitigation plans were described by Curbed NY as inadequate, because of the lack of nearby subway routes that go directly to Manhattan; the lack of passenger capacity at key transfer stations; and the fact that nearly a quarter-million riders use the every day.
Also in October 2018, it was revealed that the decline in subway ridership had accelerated in summer 2018, with a 2.5% decrease in weekday trips and an 8.8% decrease in weekend trips from August 2017 to August 2018. In a "60 Minutes" television segment about the state of the subway, published on October 21, it was mentioned that the increasing delays had led to dissatisfied customers who, in some cases, had physically assaulted conductors. In the segment, Byford described how communications-based train control (CBTC) implementation was the key part of his Fast Forward plan, and that as a result of an investment of $800 million in emergency funds, critical maintenance of the subway was being carried out. However, though on-time performance had increased slightly since the plan's implementation, riders did not notice the improvements for the most part, according to Byford. By December 2018, the MTA had identified 130 locations in the subway system where the speed limit could be increased (or in some cases, doubled), as well as 267 faulty timer signals that needed to be fixed. 
After the failure of the congestion pricing bill in early 2018, officials decided to look for other ways to fund the subway. In December 2018, an urban policy think tank proposed legalizing marijuana for non-medical uses in New York state, then collecting a tax to fund the New York City transit system. The same month, the MTA announced that as many as four percent of subway riders and 16 percent of bus riders each day might not be paying fares, amounting to 208,000 subway riders and 384,000 bus riders per day. This indicated that the decline in ridership on the subway and bus systems might not be as severe as previously indicated, because ridership counts only included riders who paid fares. In response, Byford stated that the MTA was studying ways to physically prevent fare evaders from jumping over subway turnstiles, or entering the rear doors of buses where they did not need to pay.
2019 developments.
In early January 2019, Cuomo announced that the 14th Street Tunnel would not completely shut down. Instead, work would occur on weekends and nights, and construction could be finished in 15 to 20 months. Following the announcement, Cuomo stated that he wanted to "blow up" the MTA and restructure its entire operating hierarchy. The governor cited frequent cost overruns for MTA contracts, as well as a lack of clear leadership in the agency, as reasons to rearrange the agency. A few days later, de Blasio promised to improve the bus system in his State of the City address. His plan included raising bus speeds by 25% by the next year, increasing the enforcement of bus lanes, and adding bus priority signals to 1,200 intersections with traffic lights.
Also in January 2019, the MTA announced that a new fleet of about 1,500 R262 subway cars, to be built in the 2020s, would replace the R62 and R62A fleets, which were built in the 1980s and are used on the subway system's numbered routes, in order to expedite CBTC on the Lexington Avenue Line. The MTA also announced that 95% of signal timers had been tested, resulting in the discovery of 320 faulty timers, and that 68 locations were improved for increases in speed limits. Byford also promoted some of the other changes made under the Subway Action Plan, including sealing leaks; improving drainage; repairing tracks and signal components; and replacing subway car components. One facet of the Subway Action Plan, a $9.5 million contract for an extensive cleaning of 3,000 subway cars and 100 stations, almost resulted in a strike among unionized subway cleaners. The strike was averted when the MTA ensured that the contract would be for a one-time cleaning and agreed to have two unionized workers at each cleaning site.
In February 2019, Cuomo and de Blasio jointly announced a plan that outlined ten steps to fix MTA operations. Under this plan, similar operations in the MTA's subsidiaries would be combined, a form of congestion pricing would be enacted, a cap on fare increases would be reduced to 2% a year, and the Subway Action Plan would be sped up. To reduce unnecessary costs and delays, a fare evasion prevention strategy would be created, and new project contracts would be awarded as design–build contracts. In addition, board members' terms were tied to those of the official who appointed them, the MTA's capital programs would be reviewed by a committee of independent analysts, and the MTA would undergo an independent financial audit. The MTA, city, and state of New York would work with the state legislature to enact these provisions. Shortly after, Speaker of the New York City Council Corey Johnson unveiled a competing proposal to cede control of the city's subway and bus systems to the city.
The MTA released another progress report in March 2019, stating that the subway's on-time rate had increased to 76%. However, a "New York Times" analysis of the data found that the gains were not spread equally: the A Division (numbered services and the 42nd Street Shuttle) had an average on-time rate of 79%, compared to the B Division (lettered services) 68% on-time rate. The disparity was attributed to the Automatic Train Supervision system used on much of the A Division; the CBTC signalling system used on the IRT Flushing Line (); and the opening of the Second Avenue Subway, which alleviated congestion on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (). At the end of the month, the state approved a congestion pricing plan, to go into effect by 2021 at the earliest.
As part of state legislation passed in April 2019, the MTA was supposed to create a plan to reduce costs by the end of June. A draft of the plan indicated that several departments would be eliminated, undermining Byford's role. Additionally, in May 2019, federal prosecutors started investigating alleged overtime fraud at the MTA, especially at the LIRR, which was thought to contribute to higher spending by the MTA. Following this, in July 2019, an MTA reorganization plan was published; the plan called for consolidating the MTA's 40 departments into six groups, as well as eliminating 2,700 jobs.
Two incidents affected the subway system in July 2019. The first was the Manhattan blackout of July 13, 2019, which resulted in suspended or limited service on most lines going through Midtown Manhattan for several hours. The MTA closed four Manhattan stations, and all of the A Division routes suffered extensive delays. The second incident occurred less than a week later, during the rush hour of July 20, 2019, and in the midst of a citywide heat wave: an ATS system issue caused service on most of the A Division routes to be suspended for more than an hour.
In September 2019, the MTA released a draft of their proposed $54 billion 2020–2024 capital plan. The draft calls for adding accessible features to 66 additional subway stations and adding CBTC or other modern signaling systems to parts of six more physical lines. Additionally, the Second Avenue Subway would be completed. Much of the funding would come from the new Manhattan congestion charge. 
A draft plan for a reorganization of Bronx bus routes was proposed in draft format in June 2019, with a final version published in October 2019. Many of the draft proposals were not included in the final version due to community feedback. This was followed by the publication of the Queens bus route reorganization draft in December 2019, with the final plan expected in 2020. During 2019, annual subway ridership figures increased, reversing a ridership decline that had been ongoing since 2015.
2020 developments.
On January 15, 2020, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer delivered a letter to Byford, demanding that the MTA develop, and make public, plans for restoring the "abundance" of shuttered entry points along New York City Subway routes currently contributing to severe overcrowding and longer commute times. A week later, on January 23, 2020, Byford officially resigned his position at the NYCTA, citing frequent conflicts with Cuomo. "The New York Times" later wrote that these conflicts had been gradual disagreements, rather than any single event, but that the "Byford-Cuomo estrangement was highly unusual", since New York state governors and MTA chiefs had previously interacted very little prior to the mid-2010s. Byford subsequently left New York to become Commissioner of Transport for London. 
In March 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to New York state, and thus to the New York City area, resulted in mass closures of gathering spaces such as restaurants and schools. Though the subway, bus, and railroad systems remained open, ridership across all modes of transportation started to decrease, after the MTA recommended that only essential workers use the public transit system. On buses, riders were instructed to use the back door, making the bus system effectively fare-free. Following a 50% to 90% drop in ridership on all of the MTA's systems, the agency requested $4 billion in federal funds, since the decreased fare revenue left the already-struggling agency in a financially tenuous position. By March 25, following further ridership decreases, service on buses, subways, and commuter rail was reduced to at most 75% of their regular service levels. The subway system's five part-time services, the B, C, W, Z, and 42nd Street Shuttle, were temporarily suspended. Despite this, because of increased headways between trains, smaller ridership decreases were reported in poorer neighborhoods than in wealthier areas, and trains were reportedly crowded, despite social distancing guidelines put into place during the pandemic. After at least 41 MTA workers had died and 6,000 others had gotten sick or self-quarantined by April 8, many workers alleged that the MTA had done too little to protect workers from contracting COVID-19, even as up to 40% of daily trips had to be canceled due to crew shortages. 
By mid-April, ridership on the subway had decreased by 92% due to the pandemic. Bus ridership dropped less, with some routes retaining up to half their normal ridership. To cover a potential revenue shortfall of up to $8.5 billion, the MTA faced having to cut service more permanently, or deferring capital improvements, even though transit experts said that the New York metropolitan area could not function without an effective transit system. On April 20, four City Council members requested that subway service be temporarily suspended due to the spread of COVID-19 in the subway system, but interim New York City Transit president Sarah Feinberg opposed it. Other politicians such as de Blasio advocated for shutting down some terminal stations overnight to clean the trains. The number of homeless individuals in the subway had also increased, a situation that Cuomo described as "disgusting and disrespectful". Starting on May 6, 2020, stations were closed overnight for cleaning, in what became the first planned overnight closure in the subway's history. The overnight closures would be a temporary measure that would be suspended once the pandemic was over, and during the overnight closures, bus service was added. During the closures, trains and stations were cleaned more than usual. Although officials stated that only one percent of subway ridership occurred at night, trains continued to run overnight, leading to complaints that essential workers were being unnecessarily inconvenienced. Internal MTA sources stated that it was theoretically possible for the MTA to clean the system without closing it. The NYCTA also announced that families of workers who died of COVID-19 would be eligible for $500,000 in death benefits.
Ridership on the subway started to increase at the end of May, as the rate of new COVID-19 cases decreased, though bus ridership had surpassed subway ridership. On June 8, regular service resumed with Phase 1 of the city's reopening, though the overnight subway closure remained in place. Two weeks later, MTA Chairman Pat Foye reported that roughly 95 percent of mass transit riders were adhering to wearing face masks in accordance with state executive order No. 202.17 from April 15. From April to June, bus ridership was greater than subway ridership for the first time since the MTA started keeping these records in the 1960s; bus speeds increased on average by 19%. In conjunction with this, in June, de Blasio announced that additional busways would be installed citywide.
Continued budgetary issues forced the MTA to suspend all capital projects "indefinitely" due to a deficit that could grow to $10 billion by 2022. At a meeting in August 2020, the MTA stated that without $12 billion in federal funding to cover operations in 2020 and 2021, the agency would need to take extreme measures such as eliminating capital projects, laying off thousands of staff, raising fares and tolls, cutting Access-A-Ride service, cutting service on the LIRR and Metro-North by 50%, and cutting service on the subway and bus systems by 40%. The MTA was losing $200 million per week at the time. In the wake of such a large deficit, front-door entry on buses was reinstated on August 31. Α report published by the "Daily News" on September 29 asserted that there was "no correlation" between mass transit and COVID-19 infection rates. However, over 170 transit workers reported being assaulted or harassed for asking passengers to wear face masks, prompting officials to implement a $50 fine for riders who refused to wear a face mask.
2021 developments.
Following the election of Joe Biden as U.S. president in 2020, the MTA postponed a set of planned "doomsday" changes, since Biden was seen as more friendly to public transit than his opponent, incumbent president Donald Trump. By December 2020, the MTA had decided not to implement a budget that would have resulted in 40% service cuts and massive staff layoffs, under the assumption that Congress would give $4.5 billion of aid to the MTA. With the inauguration of Biden as U.S. president in 2021, transit officials expressed optimism that the Biden administration would allocate funding to congestion pricing. Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. secretary of transportation, prioritized the congestion pricing plan that February.
In February 2021, the overnight closures were shortened to between 2 and 4 a.m. This came after criticism of the overnight closures, which opponents said disproportionately affected minority residents and low-income workers. The same month, the U.S. Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which provided the MTA with enough money to resume its capital plan. The following month, March 2021, state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli published a report showing that the subway was seeing 2 million daily riders on weekdays. The neighborhoods with the greatest increases in ridership, relative to their March 2020 lows, were generally clustered in low-income neighborhoods in the outer boroughs, while the neighborhoods with the smallest increases were largely in wealthy parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. In early May 2021, Cuomo announced that the overnight closures would end on May 17, 2021, with 24-hour service resuming on that date.
Many residents expressed reluctance to go back on the system, citing crime rates. In a survey that the MTA conducted in April 2021, 72 percent of 17,000 self-identified frequent riders said they were more concerned with increased crime than with COVID-19 transmission in the subway, while 36 percent of riders who stopped using the system since the pandemic said they were reluctant to return to the system due to their concerns over crime. There had been six murders in the system in 2020, more than in the previous three years combined, and the number of rapes, robberies, and burglaries was also recorded as having increased that year. The transit system as a whole also experienced a cyberattack in April 2021, when hackers linked to China exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in three of 18 systems controlling the New York City Transit, LIRR, and Metro-North networks; the vulnerability did not appear to cause much damage, and it was only reported in June. 
The state of emergency ended on June 30, 2021, after previously being renewed 49 times. The bus redesigns, which had been delayed during the pandemic, resumed two months later. The subway system continued to experience difficulties during this time. In August 2021, Kathy Hochul replaced Cuomo as governor, promising that she would not "micromanage" MTA leadership. The same month, a power surge disrupted service on several subway routes, particularly the L train and all numbered routes. On September 1, 2021, when of rain per hour fell during Hurricane Ida, service on the entire subway system and commuter rail lines was suspended.
The long-term effects of the pandemic also resulted in over 4,000 workers quitting or retiring from the MTA, including 2,600 from the subway division, from 2019 to 2021. This was in part due to a hiring freeze implemented during the pandemic. In June 2021 alone, about 11,000 scheduled runs of subway trains were canceled due to staff shortages. Though the MTA promised to hire more workers, the staff shortage became such a critical issue that, by September 2021, the MTA was asking some of its recently retired workers to temporarily staff subway trains.

Acceptable Risk (TV series)

Acceptable Risk is an Irish television crime drama series, broadcast on RTÉ, that first aired on 24 September 2017. Produced by Facet4 Media and Saffron Moon for RTÉ Television, "Acceptable Risk" stars Elaine Cassidy as Dublin-based Sarah Manning, whose husband Lee is murdered whilst on a business trip in Montreal. Filmed between Ireland and Canada, the first series, comprising six episodes, was broadcast during September and October 2017.
Subsequently, the series has been sold to the United States, where it made its North American debut on Acorn TV, and to the UK, where it debuted on Universal TV on December 6, 2018. Internationally, the series has been distributed by DCD Rights and Acorn Media Enterprises. Following strong viewing figures for the series, which opened with viewing figures of more than 380,000, Facet4 Media have since confirmed a second series is in development.
Production.
Elaine Cassidy said of landing the part of Sarah Manning; "[What really attracted me to the role] was that the full six episodes were written [at the time of being offered the part]. That might seem weird but it's the way things used to be, and it doesn't happen that way now." Angeline Ball said of her role as Emer Byrne; "My agent had pre-warned me that it wasn't glamorous but I thought that was even better, I really wanted a role like this. I tried to make her as bland as possible in terms of her looks and her life; she really has nothing going on other than work and finding the truth."
Writer and creator Ron Hutchinson said of his idea for the series; "I wanted to explore the impact of globalisation from the angle of those working for international corporations in a Dublin far from the tourist image of the city. It's a world which offers a high salary and a great lifestyle to those who are part of it."

Mustafa Arruf

Mustafa Hamed Moh Arruf (8 June 1958) is a Spanish sculptor.
Biography.
Mustafa Hamed Moh Arruf, born in Melilla (Spanish city located in North Africa), in 1958. He began his artistic studies at the School of Applied Arts and Artistic Trades in his hometown and continued his training in Fine Arts in the city of Granada (Spain). His early vocation is painting and sculpture and, although he has worked with materials such as wood, stone (in Holland) and bronze, it is with this material that he best expresses his art.
In the mid-eighties, he moved to Germany, where he performed various works presented at the House of Spain in Frankfurt. After a brief residency in Holland, he moved to Madrid, in the nineties, an artistically very productive period, and worked with the MAGISA Bronze Foundry and the Art Gallery Series. Later he works in the public program of Taller Schools and Oficio Houses, where he performs different teaching tasks, until he obtains a position as a restorer in the Archaeological Museum of the city of Melilla.
As the whole of his work, his urban sculpture —which is exhibited in squares, streets, avenues, parks and gardens of different countries— and public —which is exhibited in centers of different administrations— presents an important diversity, in which Artistic (ornamental) elements are combined with expressive (conceptual) elements.
A group of his works —promoted by public or private institutions, and made from his beginnings as a sculptor, in 1985, until today— the form busts or statues of famous people born or linked to his hometown: to teaching (Juan Caro Romero, 1985), to painting (Victorio Manchón, 1994), to the letters and theatrical representation (the playwright Fernando Arrabal, 1994, the poet Miguel Fernández, 1994, and the actor and theater director Antonio César Jiménez Segura, 2007), and architecture (Enrique Nieto, 2008). Another grouping forms more avant-garde sculptures, with strong contrasts in its design: flat/ volume, soft/rough, hard/soft and, above all, diagonal/circular, with quarters of moon that makes his works contain a dynamic balance and tension.
In 1997 he won the contest that the Autonomous City of Melilla had convened for the commemoration of the V Centennial of his Spanish foundation with the work Encuentros, his most monumental and popular sculpture, although not the most successful in the opinion of its creator. A replica of half of it is in the Juan Carlos I Park, in Madrid, at the foot of which there is transcribed a sonnet by Fernando Arrabal.
Another replica of the other half is in the Park of the Three Cultures, in the city of Toledo.
The sculptor —aware that an author should not interpret his work since the composition in the art of occupying the space depends, more than in any other discipline, on the point of view— makes an exception here with limitations:
In 2002 he developed a group of female sculptures, promoted by the Consejería de Obras Públicas of Melilla, which that year had decided to allocate one percent of the budget in culture for embellishment of the city. These are works with figurative aesthetic ascription, with geometric formulation and predominance in spiral rotation.
