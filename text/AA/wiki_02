Adam22

Adam John Grandmaison (born November 24, 1983), more commonly known as Adam22, is an American podcaster, journalist, internet personality, record executive, and adult film star. He is best known for being the creator and host of pop culture-oriented podcast "No Jumper".
Early life.
Grandmaison became a BMX rider at a young age and enjoyed Gucci Mane's hit "Bricks" that includes the line, "I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no Jumper." Hence No Jumper, Grandmaison has mentioned this on his podcast many times. 
"No Jumper" is also the name of Grandmaison's podcast and brand that has now become his full time business.
Career.
In 2006, Grandmaison started the website "The Come Up," which has become one of the most popular BMX websites of all time.
Later, he created OnSomeShit, a BMX biking team and BMX-based clothing line which at one point had a retail store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles.
Grandmaison hosted the inaugural Trap Circus music festival in Miami, Florida in 2017.
"No Jumper".
"No Jumper" was originally a blog on Tumblr, started by George Potter in 2011 and financed by Grandmaison. The blog reviewed early underground artists such as SpaceGhostPurrp and Clams Casino, and reviewed obscure Gucci Mane mixtapes, treating the underground with "critical attention."
Revived in 2015, Grandmaison's "No Jumper" podcast, hosted on YouTube, focuses on interviews with underground rap artists and tastemakers. As of March 2017, the interviews had received approximately 500,000 to 1 million views each. It originally started as a BMX podcast with vlogs dedicated to Grandmaison's life running OnSomeShit's retail store. His interview of Memphis rapper and well-known underground rap figure Xavier Wulf soon turned viral within hip-hop communities, sparking Grandmaison's newfound interest in interviewing known figures within both underground and mainstream hip-hop.
Grandmaison, through his "No Jumper" podcast, has been noted for interviewing up-and-coming talent as well as established rappers. He has interviewed Lil Yachty, Smokepurpp, Ugly God, Juice WRLD, Suicideboys, Action Bronson, and most famously XXXTentacion in April 2016; the latter interview received over 13 million views. This was the Florida rapper's first official professional interview, and has been credited with giving him exposure to a wide audience.
Hot 97 DJ Peter Rosenberg has said he views Grandmaison "as an advance scout searching for combustible new talent," while "Rolling Stone" described him as "underground hip-hop's major tastemaker."
The "No Jumper" YouTube channel had over 518 million total video views and 2.7 million subscribers as of March 2019. Jon Caramanica of the "New York Times" described "No Jumper" as ""The Paris Review" for the face-tattoo set."
On June 20, 2018, Grandmaison held a memorial event for XXXTentacion, who had been murdered two days prior, in front of his OnSomeShit store, with a crowd of 300 people. The crowd grew to over 1,000, and police in riot gear eventually appeared. According to reports, rubber bullets were shot and tear gas was used to disperse the crowd.
Grandmaison was one of the promoters for YouTube personality FouseyTube's event, "Hate Dies, Love Arrives", which was shut down via a bomb threat which left 1,500 people evacuated. Shortly after the event, Grandmaison interviewed Shane Dawson, Keemstar, Mid-interview, FouseyTube and numerous other YouTube personalities interrupted, causing the interview to go viral.
Personal life.
Grandmaison is in a relationship with vlogger, internet personality, and occasional adult film actress Lena Nersesian (Lena the Plug). On Valentine's Day of 2020, the two announced that they are expecting their first child together. His daughter Parker Ann Grandmaison was born on November 14 at 7:40 pm as Grandmaison announced on Twitter.
Grandmaison identifies as an atheist.
In 2018, Grandmaison was accused of sexual and physical assault by two women. Though he denied these accusations, Atlantic Records eventually severed its relationship with Grandmaison.

Mimathyma nycteis

Mimathyma nycteis is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Amurland, Korea, Northeast China) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
A. nycteis Men. (51c) has less elongate wings than the preceding species ["Chitoria ulupi|A. fulva"] , differing very considerably from the same, resembling certain species of the genus "Athyma" on the upperside, especially in the cell of the forewing bearing a white longitudinal streak along the median vein. Underside violet-brown, with the markings of the upperside reappearing, but partly widened and of a white colour which has almost a mother-of-pearl gloss; in the basal area of the hindwing there is anteriorly a long curved white spot, between the middle band and the submarginal row of spots there is a row of bluish white spots in the dark ground-colour. Female similar to male larger, rarely with a row of red-brown spots near the outer margin of the hindwing. An apparently rare form of this species is ab. "cassiope" Men. (51c), in which the white spots in the central area of the forewing are so much enlarged as to form an almost continuous, broad, strongly curved band; the middle band of the hindwing, too, is essentially dilated. Larva slug-like, dark green, laterally with light oblique stripes, segments 6—12 each with 2 thorny processes, those on segments 6, 8 and 11 being longer and thicker than the others, at the apex of the body 2 long, pointed processes; on the head 2 long thorny horns, which terminate each in 2 roundish knobs directed forward; head and back with single small short thorns, which are longest on the sides of the head, where they also stand more closely together; the parts of the body ventrally of the spiracles clothed with minute yellowish hairs; ventral surface paler than the back; length of the adult larva 52 mm. In June on Elm. Pupa whitish green like that of "ilia" and iris, but bearing a row of obtuse tubercles on the sharply keeled dorsal side of the abdomen (according to Graeser). — Amurland, Ussuri, Sutchan, Corea.
Biology.
The larva feeds on "Ulmus propinga", "Ulmus pumila".

Martha E. Forrester

Martha E. Forrester (1863-1951) was an African-American civil rights activist.
Forrester was born in Richmond, Virginia, and married Robert Forrester early in life; she worked as a public school teacher in Richmond for some years. After her husband's death she moved to Farmville, where her daughter Jeannette Clark lived. There she was among a group of retired educators who established the Council of Colored Women in 1920. She served as president of that body for 31 years, working throughout her time in the position to develop better educational opportunities for black students in Prince Edward County. Among her accomplishments was the establishment of a longer school year and better accessibility to higher-level classes. She was also instrumental in the creation of the county's first black high school, erected in 1939 and named for Robert Russa Moton. The Council of Colored Women was later renamed the Martha E. Forrester Council in her honor.
Forrester's house in Farmville has been recognized by a historic marker approved by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in March 2017 and erected later that year.

Kevin Lokko

Kevin Adom Lokko (born 3 November 1995) is an English footballer who plays as a defender for National League club Aldershot Town. He began his career at Norwich City's academy, where he spent two years as an academy scholar and was part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team during the 2012–13 season. He was released in May 2014 and joined Colchester United four months later, although injury meant he did not make any first-team appearances during his one season with the Essex club. Lokko gained his first experience of regular first-team football when he signed for National League club Welling United ahead of the 2015–16 season. 
He spent one year at Welling before joining another National League club in the form of Maidstone United in June 2016. After one season at Maidstone, Lokko signed for Stevenage in August 2017. He was immediately loaned to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge before returning to Stevenage in February 2018, then joining Dover Athletic on loan later that month. Lokko joined Dover on a permanent basis in June 2018. Lokko became captain at Dover before joining Harrogate Town in 2020. He signed for Aldershot Town of the National League in July 2021.
Early life.
Born in Poplar, London, England, Lokko grew up in Romford in Essex. His father is from Ghana and his mother is from Ukraine. Due to his mother's Ukrainian heritage, Lokko grew up speaking Russian. He attended Easton College in Norwich where he studied sports performance and business studies.
Club career.
Early career.
Lokko joined Norwich City's academy at the age of 15, signing a two-year deal as an academy scholar in the summer of 2012. He spent two years playing regularly for Norwich's under-18 team and was part of the FA Youth Cup-winning squad during the 2012–13 season. Lokko was released by the club upon the expiry of his scholarship contract in May 2014. Lokko went on trial at Colchester United in July 2014, playing in several under-21 matches, as well as in the first-team's final pre-season friendly ahead of the 2014–15 season. The trial period proved successful and Lokko signed a one-year deal on 19 August 2014, with the club stating he would join up with the under-21 squad to further his development. Although he began to train with the first-team, and was an unused substitute in two first-team matches in the opening months of the season, Lokko sustained a hip injury that kept him out of first-team action for five months and he did not make any appearances during the season. He was released when his contract expired in May 2015.
Welling United.
Ahead of the 2015–16 season, on 20 July 2015, Lokko signed a one-year contract with National League club Welling United. The move came about after Lokko had played in the club's opening two pre-season fixtures and was offered a contract following the trial. He made his debut for Welling in the club's first game of the season on 8 August 2015, playing the whole match in a 1–0 victory against Guiseley at Park View Road. Lokko scored his first competitive goal in Welling's 2–1 home win over Woking on 28 March 2016, his first-half header proving decisive in helping Welling end their 23-game winless run. He was a mainstay in the centre of defence throughout the season, making 42 appearances in all competitions, scoring once,&lt;ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2015/2016"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in what was Lokko's breakthrough season of regular first-team football. Lokko left the club when his contract expired in May 2016.
Maidstone United.
Lokko subsequently signed for National League club Maidstone United on a free transfer on 3 June 2016. He rejected several offers from other National League teams prior to signing for Maidstone, stating he had "done his research" and was impressed by Maidstone's three promotions in four years under manager Jay Saunders. Lokko made his Maidstone debut in a 1–1 home draw with York City on the opening day of the 2016–17 season. He scored his first goal for the club at the end of that month, an injury-time winning goal in a 1–0 away victory at Boreham Wood on 29 August 2016. Lokko scored twice in Maidstone's 4–2 win against Chester at the Gallagher Stadium on 18 February 2017, both of Lokko's goals coming in the first half of the match. He played regularly during his one season at Maidstone, scoring four times in 46 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2016/2017"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Stevenage.
Four days before the start of the 2017–18 season, on 2 August 2017, Lokko signed for League Two club Stevenage for an undisclosed fee and on a two-year contract. The transfer occurred when Stevenage triggered a buyout clause in Lokko's contract after several other clubs had also shown interest in the player. Two days after joining Stevenage, Lokko was loaned out to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge of the National League on a season-long loan agreement, in order for him to continue to gain first-team experience. Lokko made his Dagenham debut in the club's 2–1 home victory against Barrow on 5 August 2017 and was awarded Man of the Match for his performance. He scored in consecutive games at the end of August in home fixtures against Ebbsfleet United and Bromley respectively. He was a regular in the centre of defence during his time at Dagenham, scoring two goals in 28 appearances in all competitions.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2017/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Lokko was recalled by Stevenage at the start of February 2018, with their chairman Phil Wallace revealing that several transfer deadline day deals gave the club the opportunity to recall Lokko and ensure he was "integrated in the squad on a daily basis ready for next season". He made his debut for the club as an 85th-minute substitute in the club's 3–1 away defeat at Forest Green Rovers on 13 February 2018. A week after making his Stevenage debut, Lokko was loaned out to National League club Dover Athletic for the remainder of the 2017–18 campaign; Stevenage retaining an option to recall Lokko after 28 days if necessary. He made his debut for Dover in a 3–1 away loss at AFC Fylde on 24 February 2018, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in the match. Lokko went on to make 12 appearances during the loan agreement, scoring once, before returning to Stevenage at the end of the season where he was made available for transfer.&lt;ref name="Player meetings concluded – retained/released list available"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Dover Athletic.
Lokko signed for Dover Athletic on a permanent basis on 27 June 2018, joining the club for an undisclosed fee. He made his second debut at Dover in the club's first match of the 2018–19 season, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 defeat to Wrexham on 4 August 2018.&lt;ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2018/2019"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lokko scored his first goal of the campaign three days later, briefly giving Dover the lead from close-range in an eventual 2–2 draw with Bromley. Lokko was voted as the National League Player of the Month for January 2019, with Lokko scoring once and Dover's defence keeping three clean sheets during the month. He played 42 times during his first full season at Dover, scoring six goals from defence, as the club ended the season nine games unbeaten to finish in 14th place in the National League. Lokko was named as Dover's new captain on 27 June 2019. He made 29 appearances and scored four goals during Dover's 2019–20 season, which was curtailed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Harrogate Town.
Lokko returned to the Football League when he signed for League Two club Harrogate Town on a two-year contract on 14 August 2020. Harrogate's assistant manager Paul Thirlwell stated the club had tracked his availability after he impressed them when Harrogate played Dover during the previous season. He scored on his Harrogate debut in the club's 2–2 draw with Grimsby Town in the EFL Trophy on 8 September 2020. He played a peripheral role during the 2020–21 season, making eight appearances and scoring two goals in all competitions. With a year remaining on his contract at Harrogate, Lokko was told he was free to look for another club at the end of the season. 
Aldershot Town.
He subsequently signed for National League club Aldershot Town on a two-year contract on 16 July 2021.
International career.
Lokko was called up to the England C team, who represent England at non-League level, for their two fixtures in May 2017. He made his England C debut on 28 May 2017, playing the full match in a 2–1 win over Panjab FA at Damson Park. Two days later, he once again played the whole 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Jersey FA.
Style of play.
Lokko has been deployed as a centre-back throughout his career. He is left-footed and plays as a left-sided central defender. Described by Harrogate Town assistant manager Paul Thirlwell as a ball-playing defender with "a great range of passing", Lokko has also been praised for his attacking threat from set-pieces.

Enrico Moretti

Enrico Moretti (born 1968) is an Italian-born American economist and the Michael Peevey and Donald Vial Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also the editor-in-chief of the "Journal of Economic Perspectives," Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge), and Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic Policy Research (London) and the Institute for the Study of Labor (Bonn). His research covers the fields of labor economics and urban economics.  He has received several awards and honors, including the Society of Labor Economists’ Rosen Prize for outstanding contributions to labor economics, the Carlo Alberto Medal, the IZA Young Labor Economist Award and a Fulbright Fellowship.
Along with over 60 articles in peer-reviewed economics journals, Moretti's 2012 book for general audiences, "The New Geography of Jobs", has received widespread attention. The book was described by Barack Obama in 2019 as “a timely and smart discussion of how different cities and regions have made a changing economy work for them — and how policymakers can learn from that to lift the circumstances of working Americans everywhere." In 2018, it was described by  Paul Krugman in The New York Times  as “a must reading for anyone trying to understand the state of America” and by William Galston in The Wall Street Journal as  “the most important book of the decade on the contemporary economy." The book has been translated in eight languages and was awarded the William Bowen Prize by Princeton University for the most important contribution toward understanding public policy and the labor market.
Moretti’s research focuses on the growing  geographic differences in economic well-being between cities. In his research, he has found that the sorting of highly educated Americans — and high-paying jobs requiring a lot of education — into certain communities has led to other communities falling behind. Moreover, they've been falling behind faster economically as time goes on. This pattern, in turn, has been reflected in other socioeconomic differences, including political attitudes, divorce rates and life expectancies.
In addition to his work in labor economics and economic geography, Moretti has published peer-reviewed articles on the social returns to education; social interactions and peer effects; health economics;  political economy; and the economics of the family.

Algidum () was a town in ancient Italy at the foot of Mount Algidus on the Via Latina. 
Geography.
It was located near the border between the territory of ancient Latium and the territory of the Aequi.
Architecture.
It housed a temple to Diana.
History.
In 465 BC it was the site of a battle between Roman forces led by the consuls Quintus Fabius Vibulanus and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus and the Aequi, which resulted in a victory for the Romans. 
In 431 BC, armies from the Aequi and Volsci tribes occupied Algidus. According to some sources, Roman troops led by the consuls Titus Quinctius Poenus Cincinnatus and Gaius Julius Mento launched an attack on them soon after, but were defeated. Their defeat is said to have been the cause for Aulus Postumius Tubertus being appointed dictator. On the 18th of June, Postumius launched an attack on the Aequi and Volsci, and succeeded in dislodging them. In 419/418 BC, the Aequi and Labicani briefly occupied the city.

Gretchen Peters (journalist)

Gretchen Peters is an American journalist and advisor. An expert on transnational organized crime, she is the author of "Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War". She is the executive director of the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime, an operational think tank focused on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security and the executive director of The Satao Project, a consulting firm that supports governments and industries to counter serious organized crime and corruption, and their convergence with terrorism, violence and social unrest.
Early life and education.
Peters has a BA from Harvard University and a Masters in International Relations from the University of Denver's Korbel School of International Studies. At the Korbel School, she was the recipient of the Sié Chéou-Kang security and diplomacy fellowship and the Association of Former Intelligence Officers Life's Choices Foundation Scholarship.
Career.
Peters began her career as a journalist, helping to start the newspaper "The Cambodia Daily". For the following ten years, she covered Pakistan and Afghanistan, first for the Associated Press and later as a reporter for ABC News. Peters was nominated for an Emmy for her coverage of the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto and won the SAJA Journalism Award for a "Nightline" segment on Pervez Musharraf.
Peters has conducted extensive research on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security, from drugs and money laundering to wildlife and timber trafficking. Following the publication of her book, she advised U.S. military and diplomats in Afghanistan.
Peters was previously Senior Fellow on Transnational Crime at the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, School of Public Policy. She also co-chaired an OECD Task Force working to improve policy approaches to fight the trafficking of wildlife and other environmentally sensitive goods. Peters serves on the Board of Advisors of the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Convergence.
Wildlife, drugs, and US national security.
In 2015, Peters traveled to Africa with The Satao Project to study ivory supply chains in Tanzania and Kenya. Her work zeroed in on “a regional ecosystem moving ivory, drugs and guns … a matrix of different organisations that collaborate to move illegal goods along the Swahili coast.” She quickly identified the underlying problem: corruption. “If there’s a network that is moving illegal goods from one country to another, there are inevitably government officials involved, protecting them or looking the other way,” she said. Since then Peters has continued focus on the intersection of wildlife, narcotics, and U.S. national security interests, being cited in multiple articles, briefs, and documentaries.
Terrorism and drug trafficking.
In 2009 Peters published "Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War". In the book, Peters argues there is a deepening relationship between the Taliban and drug traffickers. "They start to look more like Tony Soprano and his guys than holy warriors," Peters said in an interview with CBS News. "They behave like criminals. They're involved in the drugs trade, human trafficking, kidnapping, gun running…all sorts of criminal activity." Peters spent five years researching the book, interviewing insurgents, drug kingpins, government officials, and poppy farmers. She discussed the book in a June 2009 appearance on the "Daily Show with Jon Stewart".
In 2010 Peters published a paper about the Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based militant group, with West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center and in 2012, Peters testified before the U.S. Congress about the Haqqani network.

<doc id="56581552" url="?curid=56581552" title="In-situ processing">
In-situ processing

In-situ processing also known as in-storage processing (ISP) is a computer science term that refers to processing data where it resides. "In-situ" means "situated in the original, natural, or existing place or position." An in-situ process processes data where it is stored such as in solid-state drives (SSDs) or memory devices like NVDIMM, rather than sending the data to a computer's central processing unit (CPU).
The technology utilizes embedded processing engines inside the storage devices to make them capable of running user applications in-place, so data does not need to leave the device to be processed. The technology is not new, but modern SSD architecture, as well as the availability of powerful embedded processors, make it more appealing to run user applications in-place. SSDs deliver higher data throughput in comparison to hard disk drives (HDDs). Additionally, in contrast to the HDDs, the SSDs can handle multiple I/O commands at the same time.
The SSDs contain a considerable amount of processing horsepower for managing flash memory array and providing a high-speed interface to host machines. These processing capabilities can provide an environment to run user applications in-place. The computational storage device (CSD) term refers to an SSD which is capable of running user applications in-place. In an efficient CSD architecture, the embedded in-storage processing subsystem has access to the data stored in flash memory array through a low-power and high-speed link. The deployment of such CSDs in clusters can increase the overall performance and efficiency of big data and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
Reducing data transfer bottlenecks.
Webscale data center designers have been trying to develop storage architectures that favor high-capacity hosts. In the following figure (from ), such a storage system is shown where 64 SSDs are attached to a host. For the sake of simplicity, only the details of one SSD are demonstrated. Modern SSDs usually contain 16 or more flash memory channels which can be utilized concurrently for flash memory array I/O operations. Considering 512 MB/s bandwidth per channel, the internal bandwidth of an SSD with 16 flash memory channels is about 8 GB/s. This huge bandwidth decreases to about 1 GB/s due to the complexity of the host interface software and hardware architecture. In other words, the accumulated bandwidth of all internal channels of the 64 SSDs reaches the multiplication of the number of SSDs, the number of channels per SSD, and 512 MB/s (bandwidth of each channel) which is equal to 512 GB/s. While the accumulated bandwidth of the SSDs’ external interfaces is equal to 64 multiply by 1 GB/s (the host interface bandwidth of each SSD) which is 64 GB/s. However, In order to talk to the host, all SSDs required to be connected to a PCIe switch. Hence, the available bandwidth of the host is limited to 32 GB/s.
Overall, there is a 16X gap between the accumulated internal bandwidth of all SSDs and the bandwidth available to the host. In other words, for reading 32 TB of data, the host needs 16 minutes while internal components of the SSDs can read the same amount of data in about 1 minute. Additionally, in such storage systems, data need to continuously move through the complex hardware and software stack between hosts and storage units, which imposes a considerable amount of energy consumption and dramatically decreases the energy efficiency of large data centers. Hence, storage architects need to develop techniques to decrease data movement, and ISP technology has been introduced to overcome the aforementioned challenges by moving the process to data.
Efficiency and utilization.
The computational storage technology minimizes the data movements in a cluster and also increases the processing horsepower of the cluster by augmenting power-efficient processing engines to the whole system. This technology can potentially be applied to both HDDs and SSDs; however, modern SSD architecture provides better tools for developing such technologies. The SSDs which can run user application in-place are called computational storage devices (CSDs). These storage units are augmentable processing resources, which means they are not designed to replace the high-end processors of modern servers. Instead, they can collaborate with the host’s CPU and augment their efficient processing horsepower to the system. The scientific article “Computational storage: an efficient and scalable platform for big data and HPC applications” which is published by Springer Publishing under open access policy (free for the public to access) shows the benefits of CSD utilization in the clusters.
Examples of in-storage processing can be seen in fields like visualization efforts, biology and chemistry. This showcases how this technology allows for actions and results to be seen more efficiently than through data movement, regardless of the data being moved. The following figures (from ) show how CSDs can be utilized in an Apache Hadoop cluster and on a Message Passing Interface-based distributed environment.
Industry.
In the storage industry, implementations from several companies are now available, including from NGD Systems, ScaleFlux and Eideticom. Other companies have tried to do similar work in the past, including Micron Technology and Samsung. The approach from all of these are the same direction, managing or processing data where it resided.
NGD Systems was the first company to create in-situ processing storage and has produced two versions of the device since 2017. The Catalina-1 was a standalone SSD that offered 24 TB of flash along with processing. A second product called Newport was released in 2018 that offered up to 32 TB of flash memory.
ScaleFlux uses a CSS-1000 NVMe device that uses host resourcing and kernel changes to address the device and use Host resources to manage up to 6.4 TB flash on the device, or base SSD. Eideticom utilizes a device called a No-Load DRAM-only NVMe device as an accelerator with no actual flash storage for persistent data. Micron called their version ‘Scale In’ at a Flash Memory Summit (FMS) event in 2013 but was never able to productize it and was based on a SATA SSD in production. Samsung has worked on various versions of devices from KV Store and others.

Annamarie Saarinen

Annamarie Saarinen (born January 11, 1969) is a health advocate, economist and co-founder of the Newborn Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that aims to accelerate the pace of early detection and intervention for treatable newborn health conditions.. 
In 2008, Saarinen’s daughter Eve was born with an undetected critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). Although Saarinen's newborn daughter was in heart failure at 2 days old, she was nearly discharged without a diagnosis and survived two heart surgeries in the first months of life. This experience inspired Saarinen to create the Newborn Foundation | Coalition and launched the country’s first multi-hospital newborn heart screening pilot in collaboration with a state department of health, with the purpose of making CCHD screening a standard of care in the United States. As a result, the screening was added to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and all 50 states including the District of Columbia have adopted universal screening. 
Approximately 4 million U.S. newborns each year are now being screened for heart defects using pulse oximetry. 
Professional Background.
In 2016, Saarinen was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama Administration to the federal Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC). She has helped draft more than 40 pieces of health legislation, authored more than 200 policy briefings and co-authored numerous published manuscripts on the importance of advancing early detection and treatment of neonatal and pediatric health conditions. 
Under her leadership, the BORN Project was selected as one of only 24 global innovation projects from around the world addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals addressing human rights, health equity and innovation. The work of the UN Solutions Summit cohort was co-convened by the White House and the United Nations in collaborations with the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Kenyan Ministry of Technology, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of Norway, the Government of Fiji and the Global Innovation Exchange.
Thus far, the BORN project has provided neonatal pulse oximetry screening training and implementation, and a data collection framework for more than 1,200 health workers, expanding its screening cohort to nearly 300,000 newborns across 200 delivery sites in 10 low and middle-income countries. It was also among the first formal public/private sector commitments to reduce preventable newborn mortality as part of the UN Secretary General's "Every Woman, Every Child initiative." 
Newborn Foundation | Coalition.
In 2011, under Saarinen's leadership, the Newborn Foundation | Coalition successfully lobbied the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to include pulse-oximetry testing for CCHDs in their universal screening recommendations. As a result, all 50 states including the District of Columbia adopted these federal recommendations - known as the Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), with roughly 4 millions U.S. newborns now being screened each year for CCHDs using pulse oximetry. 
Saarinen is leading the BORN project, a global health initiative leveraging pulse oximetry technology to combat neonatal mortality. The project is a targeted education-and-implementation initiative with the goal of bringing low-cost, effective screening tools, technologies and protocols to remote and resource-poor settings to earlier diagnose and treat medically fragile infants. To date, the foundation has worked in 16 countries, screening hundreds of thousands of newborns in its project portfolio, leading to formal newborn screening policies in China, Mongolia, the Philippines, India, and Mexico. 
In 2016, the Newborn Foundation was among the first investment grants from London-based Global Innovation Fund (GIF), supported the Department of International Development in the UK; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); the Omidyar Network; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia).  The grant was used to expand the BORN Project, and bring low-cost, mobile-app based pulse oximetry technology to 93,000 newborns for earlier detection and access to treatment for life-threatening, but treatable health conditions. 
In 2018, the Newborn Foundation developed Find Pneumonia Sooner - a set of resources to help drive adoption of screening and diagnostic tools to reduce childhood pneumonia deaths as the single biggest killer of children globally. The initiative supports the Newborn Foundation’s role as a founding partner of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, a global public-private partnership to support national governments to end preventable child pneumonia deaths by 2030, and was part of a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
In 2019, The Newborn Foundation and co-founder Annamarie Saarinen were selected as 2019 #Give16 Honors recipients, presented by the 3M Open and honoring 16 individuals and organizations for outstanding impact in the community. The award also helped raise funds for programs at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, a Newborn Foundation partner research center.

Between the Shadows

Between the Shadows is a supplement published by Palladium Books in 1996 for the horror fantasy role-playing game "Nightbane" .
Contents.
"Between the Shadows" is a 144-page softcover book that was written by Carlos Martijena-Carella and Kevin Siembieda. The contents present a number of settings for the "Nightbane" game, including 
There is also information about the Spook Squad (a shadowy government agency).
Reception.
In the May 1996 edition of "Arcane", Lucya Szachnowski was generally positive about this supplement, saying, ""Production quality is high, with some excellent artwork. There are plenty of conversion notes and crossover suggestions for using "Nightbane" with other Palladium systems, and it's well-suited for importing ideas from other horror games. Great stuff." Szachnowski concluded by giving the book an above average rating of 8 out of 10.
In the July 1996 edition of "Dragon" (Issue 231), Rick Swan thought this book was "an above average effort", but asked why, since there were 144 pages, there wasn't enough room for "a couple of full-blown adventures?"

Ozimops petersi

Ozimops petersi, the inland free-tailed bat is a species of bat found in Australia.
It is notable for being able to tolerate the most extreme body temperature range of any known mammal.
Taxonomy.
It was initially described in 1884 by Swedish zoologist Dr. Wilhelm Leche. 
Leche had acquired a collection of specimens from Gustav Schneider, a Swiss natural history dealer, and used to describe a new species that was distinguishable from the rest of the series.
In 1906, Oldfield Thomas published a paper in which he considered "N. petersi" as synonymous with an earlier description of species "Mormopterus planiceps" ("Ozimops planiceps", in part).
This status was largely maintained until 2014, although greater diversity had previously been identified, when a study examining the morphology and genetics of the bats of Australia showed that it was distinct enough to be considered a full species. This description removed the name from a synonymy of "M. planiceps", publishing a subgeneric arrangement "Mormopterus" ("Ozimops") "petersi" before that was elevated to genus "Ozimops".
Leche initially placed it in the now defunct genus "Nyctinomus" with the species name "petersi".
While Leche did not state the eponym for the species name "petersi", it is possible that it was named in honor of Wilhelm Peters, a German naturalist who described several species and genera of bats and had died a year prior to Leche's publication in 1884.
Description.
In describing the species, Leche noted that it is similar in appearance to the east-coast free-tailed bat, "Mormopterus norfolkensis".
He wrote that it differs in its flat, compressed skull.
It is a small species of bat, with a head and body length of , a tail length of , and a forearm length of .
The tail extends approximately past the edge of the uropatagium.
Its tragus is tiny, at only long.
It weighs .
Biology.
"Ozimops petersi" is nocturnal species, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as tree cavities or under metal roofs.
Females have one breeding season annually, and give birth in November or December.
The litter size is generally one individual, with the young called a "pup."
Body temperature toleration.
This species of bat can tolerate the most extreme range of body temperatures of any known mammal.
Its body temperature has been recorded as low as and as high as .
This upper limit even exceeds recorded maximum body temperatures of camels.
These bats can survive these otherwise lethal extremes by using torpor, which is a physiological adaptation.
Conservation.
As of 2020, it is listed as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.
It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large geographic range; it tolerates a variety of habitats; its population size is thought to be large; and it is documented regularly throughout its range.
Its population may exceed one million individuals, although this number may be declining.

Museum of Spirits

The Museum of Spirits () is situated on the island of Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden. The museum was about Sweden's wine and spirit history and the manufacture of alcohol. In the fixed exhibitions, showed older production and bottling equipment for wine and spirits, labels from older wine and spirits in Sweden, an exhibition about Swedish drinking habits and beverage visor, objects from ancient wine history and a complete interior design from a wine trade from the time before Systembolaget monopoly. The museum has permanent and temporary exhibitions related to the drinking culture of Sweden. The museum also functions as an art gallery, as it houses and displays the Absolut Art Collection.
The museum houses three exhibition venues, including the permanent, interactive exhibition Sweden: Spirits of a Nation ("Spritlandet Sverige").
History.
The Museum of Spirits was opened as the Wine &amp; Spirit Historical Museum in the Grönstedtska palace, in Vasastaden, Stockholm, in 1967, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state-owned company AB Vin &amp; Sprit.
In the spirit museum, among other things, it is shown by the state of the Absolut Art Collection, a collection of 850 artwork from 1986 onwards for Absolut Vodka of Andy Warhol and 550 other famous artists. This was excluded from the state's sales of Wine &amp; Sprit AB to Pernod in 2008 after a unanimous parliamentary decision, caused by a motion of Leif Pagrotsky. Selection of the art collection is shown in an annual thematic exhibition that is from spring and over the summer. Every autumn is an Absolut-artist in to make a solar setting. 
In May 2012, the spirits museum moved to 2,000 square meters of large premises in the Galärskjulen at Djurgården in Stockholm. 
In 2014, Petter Nisson, who had previously operated La Gazzetta (described by the "New York Times" as "one of the most celebrated creative neo-bistros in Paris"), opened a restaurant at the museum.
Absolut Art Collection.
The Absolut Art Collection consists of work created between 1985 and 2004. It contains nearly 900 artworks - paintings, graphic art, photography, furniture, fashion and handicrafts - by 600 artists and designers, all in some way portraying the Absolut Vodka bottle.
The first piece commissioned was Andy Warhol’s "Absolut Warhol", in 1986. Other commissions went to, for example, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, Steven Salzman, Damien Hirst, Tom Ford, Louise Bourgeois, Ola Billgren, Dan Wolgers and Linn Fernström.

Susana Casillas (born in Guadalajara, Jalisco) is a Mexican plastic artist internationally recognized for her portraiture artwork that displays influences of impressionism and figurative art. Her work has been displayed at numerous international art venues in Mexico, the United States, China, and France.
Artistic development.
Casillas started her career as a self-taught artist. Since her childhood she experimented with watercolors and acrylic painting, later she added oil painting as one of her preferred media. About the concept of her work she stated in an interview:
"In my work I try to communicate the idea of duality. I like painting faces. I sort of make two fusions of them in my portraits. They represent the mental or earthy realm, and the spiritual one, which I call 'instinct'. I think if people were able to listen to their instinct, there wouldn't be so much evil, there would be more love; it's something ever present within, like the soul and consciousness. It tells us what is good or wrong, it also tells us when we need to be alert. I've read a lot on these subjects, they have really defined me".
Exhibitions.
She’s currently working on her upcoming exhibitions for the year 2018: Los Angeles, Chicago, Santa Barbara (USA), Paris (France), Mexico City, León, Guadalajara, Baja California Sur, Los Mochis, Oaxaca (Mexico), and Norway.

Ileden and Oxenden Woods

Ileden and Oxenden Woods is an biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) south-east of Canterbury in Kent. It is in the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is located in Adisham parish.
The SSSI incorporates six named woods. From north to south, these are Oxenden Wood, Pitt Wood, Woodlands Wood, Boughtonland Wood, Well Wood and Ileden Wood.
These woods have a variety of soil types and diverse habitats. There is a rich bird community and ground flora, including two nationally rare orchids, narrow-lipped helleborine and lady orchid.
Public footpaths go through the woods.
Controversy.
Ileden and Oxenden Woods has been the subject of significant local dispute in recent years over public access, ownership and management.
In 2010, Adisham residents protested when local landowner and former banker to the Queen, Timothy Steel, attempted to prevent walkers from accessing paths in the woods. After Kent County Council's order to maintain public access was appealed by Mr. Steel, a public enquiry followed, which ruled in the villagers’ favour and confirmed the status of the paths as public rights of way.
Since 2019, concerns have been raised by local residents regarding the ownership and management of the woodland, after Woodlands.co.uk acquired land in Pitt and Oxenden Woods. A public meeting was held in September 2019, where the possible impact of Woodlands.co.uk's practices of woodland lotting – the selling of woodland in small chunks – was discussed, and a recommendation was made to retain management of the woodland as a whole. Community purchase of the woodland has been considered, as well as the possibility of invoking an Article 4 direction to restrict permitted development rights. The situation remains unresolved.

Distributed ledger technology law

Distributed ledger technology law ("DLT law") (also called blockchain law, Lex Cryptographia or algorithmic legal order) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment. Smart contracts, which are also enforceable legal contracts and were created through interaction of lawyers and developers, are called smart legal contracts.
DLT and law issues.
Issue of situs and place for dispute resolution.
In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts. International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. "However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be." Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. "Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes."
In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution. "Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution."
Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT.
An absence of legal compliance mechanism on DLT, self-executing nature of code on DLT and limited ability to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several possible solutions of addressing these issues. "One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and application programming interface (API) of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database."
On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by Alexander Savelyev:
"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority.
(2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‘offline’ mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims."
Issue of automation of smart contracts and 'Oracles'.
To facilitate the self-execution, a smart contract needs access to sources of event information through which the execution of its terms and conditions is assessed. "In the interest rate swap example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information." The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on Ethereum blockchain or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by Corda distributed ledger. The solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external party (or a machine) providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met. "Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly."
Areas of law.
Ubiquitous dissemination of information technology and the Internet led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of cyberspace. According to The Law of the Horse theory proposed by Frank H. Easterbrook, general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each. This theory was challenged by Lawrence Lessig, who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles. Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law "characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations".
As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of cryptocurrency and regulation of initial coin offering, use of smart contracts, status of DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and other.
Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts.
While in the UK and the EU at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the United States several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts.
Vermont.
On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as "mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise"
Arizona.
In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.” HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless” and definition of smart contract as "event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger".
The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.
Nevada.
In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada. In addition, Nevada was the first state to ban local governments from taxing the use of "blockchain". With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as "an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information".
Delaware.
On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders. "Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty."
Illinois.
On January 31, 2018, Illinois regarded its role in the development of the blockchain ecosystem as one which "supports the distinct needs of the respective ecosystem stakeholders: entrepreneurs, capital providers, developers, governments, and academics to support and encourage the creation and growth of 15 blockchain companies in Illinois." To accomplish this mission the Illinois Blockchain Initiative created the role of the State of Illinois Blockchain Business Liaison, which is responsible for the engagement of these stakeholders within the ecosystem to identify and conclusively work to resolve their respective needs. Over the past year, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has compiled a database of over 200 blockchain and distributed ledger technology pilots, projects and strategies announced by public sector entities. The database is an overview of how government at various levels globally 29 are employing blockchain technology in their efforts to govern, improve the competitiveness of their economy and also deliver high-quality services in a more efficient manner. The public sector is one of the most active blockchain sector’s exploring the technology for a wide variety of use cases. Adoption of the technology in the public section is accelerating at an extraordinary pace.

Embassy of Portugal, Bangkok

The Embassy of Portugal in Bangkok is the diplomatic mission of Portugal in Thailand. It is located in Bang Rak District, on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River, and is served by Soi Charoen Krung 30 (also known as Captain Bush Lane). Dating to 1820, with the ambassador's residence built in 1860, it is the oldest diplomatic mission in Thailand, and the ambassador's residence has been recognized as an award-winning historic building.
History.
Portugal was the first European nation to come into contact with Siam in the 16th century, during the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The Portuguese were granted land near the capital, and a sizeable community settled in Siam. Following the Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and the subsequent establishment of Thonburi and Rattanakosin as Siam's successor kingdoms, the Portuguese resettled in the new capitals, in the area of today's Bangkok.
In 1786, as thanks for Portugal's assistance in the Nine Armies' War against the Burmese, King Rama I granted a piece of land to Portugal, which would be used for the establishment of the Holy Rosary Church. The King also promised land for a factory (trading post), should the Portuguese wish to establish one. This was realised in 1820, during the reign of King Rama II. A piece of land on the river, not far from the church, was granted to the Portuguese Consul-General, Carlos Manoel da Silveira. The land, 72 "wa" (fathoms) along the waterfront and 50 "wa" wide, with two shipyards, had been the former residence of the Vietnamese Emperor Gia Long during his time in exile in Siam.
The original building, of bamboo and wood, was replaced by a masonry structure, the construction of which began in 1860. Plans were made for materials to be shipped in from Goa, but the ship was wrecked during the journey and local materials had to be used instead. Interruptions and delays led to construction being suspended in 1867. By 1875, the unfinished structure had deteriorated, and the consulate hired Italian-Austrian architect Joachim Grassi to rebuild it within a time frame of five months. The construction cost 10,000 Mexican dollars. The building was inaugurated by Consul Antonio Feliciano Marques Pereira, and has since served as the residence of the consul, and later of the ambassador, following the consulate's elevation to embassy status. By this time, Charoen Krung Road had been built, and the embassy would come to be served by the side-street known as Captain Bush Lane. Other foreign missions, including those of Britain and France, would also be established nearby, and the area became a centre of the European expatriate community during the turn of the 19th–20th centuries.
Architecture.
The Ambassador's residence is a two-storey building built in Colonial style. The floor plan is rectangular, with a central front porch and gable projecting from the hipped roof demonstrating Neo-Palladian influence. The front façade, which faces the river, features a loggia running the entire length of the lower floor. On the upper floor, the central porch has three arched windows, divided by pilasters, above which the coat of arms of Portugal decorates the gable.
The entrance, decorated with ceramic tiles from Portugal, opens into a large hall, which is a few steps lower than outside ground level due to subsidence and subsequent raising of the exterior grounds to prevent flooding. The lower floor previously contained offices, which have been relocated to a separate building, and now hosts a reception room. A prison cell, used in the days of extraterritoriality, also used to be located in the basement. A staircase leads up to a central hall on the upper floor, which grants access to all rooms, including the bedroom, sitting room, and small and large dining rooms. Verandas line the front and the rear of the upper floor.
The building has undergone multiple changes, renovations and restorations, including the installation of electricity and air conditioning during the 20th century, and most recently in 2013 to bring the building closer to its original state. The original teak, used for structural beams and upper-level flooring, remains intact. The building is the oldest diplomatic residence in Bangkok, and received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 1984.
Among the decorative objects in the residence are a pair of carved wooden doors from at least the 18th century, which had been brought from the original Portuguese settlement in Ayutthaya. Several bronze cannons guard the entrance to the residence.
A former warehouse, part of the historical factory or "feitoria", now serves as the chancery. It underwent major renovations in 2004, with contributions by Portuguese architects and engineers. Retaining the original wooden structural work, metal and glass now frame the modern and "chic" offices, as well as the Portuguese Cultural Center's classroom, library and resources centre on the lower floor. A third building contains staff residences.
The embassy has relatively large grounds and gardens, part of which it leases to the next-door Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel for the hotel's swimming pool and tennis courts. Flood walls along the riverbank and pumps are needed to protect the compound from the river.
In 2017, a mural was installed on the walls of the embassy by Portuguese street artist Vhils, as part of his "Scratching the Surface" series. The project, sponsored by the embassy, was part of an effort to promote the surrounding neighbourhood as Bangkok's Creative District, led by the Thailand Creative and Design Center.
Operations.
The Portuguese embassy in Bangkok is a relatively small diplomatic mission. , it has seven members of staff. The Portuguese Ambassador to Thailand is also accredited to Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia. The embassy works on supporting the small community—of about 1,000 people—of Portuguese nationals in Thailand, as well as promoting bilateral relations in culture, commercial activity, tourism and academia. The current Ambassador, as of 2018, is Francisco Patto.

SS Willis L. King

SS "Willis L. King" (Official number 208397) was a , steel-hulled, propeller-driven American Great Lakes freighter built in 1911 by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ecorse, Michigan. She was scrapped in 1984 in Ashtabula, Ohio. "Willis L. King" is best known for her collision with the steamer on August 20, 1920, in Whitefish Bay.
History.
In 1906 the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company commissioned two freighters named and , both named after the founders of the large company, and both were built by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ecorse, Michigan. The large fleet was managed by W.H. Becker, a prominent fleet manager and owner from Cleveland, Ohio.
Due to the increasing demand for iron ore, J &amp; L commissioned two identical vessels; "Willis L. King" from the Great Lakes Engineering Works (GLEW) of Ecorse, Michigan, and the from the American Ship Building Company (AMSHIP) of Lorain, Ohio. They were identical in every respect and had a length of and a 12,000-ton cargo capacity.
"Willis L. King"s keel was laid on September 12, 1910; slightly over three months later she was launched on December 17, 1911 as hull number #79. She was commissioned by the Interstate Steamship Company (W.H. Becker, Mgr.) of Cleveland, Ohio (a subsidiary of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company). She entered service on April 18, 1911, sailing light from Ecorse, Michigan, bound for Toledo, Ohio.
"Superior City" disaster.
On August 20, 1920 "Willis L. King" had just unloaded a cargo of iron ore at Ashtabula, Ohio, and was on her way to the ore docks to pick up another load of ore. Meanwhile, was downbound from Two Harbors, Minnesota, heavily loaded with 7,600 tons of iron ore in her cargo hold.
Noted Great Lakes maritime historian and author Dwight Boyer described the collision between the two ships in his book "Ships and Men of the Great Lakes". He wrote: 
"She was [R]ammed on her port side, aft of midships … [causing] … a tremendous explosion when the terrible inrushing wall of cold water burst her aft bulkheads and hit the boilers. The vessel’s stern was literally blown off…. [and she] was nearly halved in the collision."
Most of "Superior City"s crew were trying to lower the lifeboats that were located directly above the boilers. When the cold water caused the boilers to explode, the majority of the crew was killed instantly. The deadly collision occurred at 9:10 pm.
Later history.
On May 31, 1926, "Willis L. King" collided with the laker in heavy fog just twelve miles above the Soo Locks.

Highvie Hamududu

Highvie Hambulo Hamududu (born 23 March 1970) is a Zambian politician. He served as Member of the National Assembly for Bweengwa between 2006 and 2016.
Biography.
Hamududu studied for a Bachelors Degree in economics at the University of Zambia. After graduating in 1994 he worked briefly at the cabinet office as a Manpower Information Officer, after which he joined Zambia Cooperative Federation Finance Services as a District Operations Officer in Livingstone and Choma. He later worked for Commerce Bank in Lusaka as an Assistant Credit Manager. In 1996 he moved to Namibia to work as a lecturer in economics at the Institute of Higher Education. He remained at the Institute until 2006 when he returned to Zambia to run for parliament. He was elected to the National Assembly for Bweengwa constituency in the 2006 general elections as a member of the United Party for National Development (UPND), replacing the previous UPND MP Japhet Moonde died shortly before the elections. He was re-elected in the 2011 general elections.
In February 2016 President Edgar Lungu claimed that he had offered Hamududu the post of Deputy Finance Minister, but had been turned down. Hamududu was subsequently sidelined and not selected as a UPND candidate for the 2016 elections, with Kasautu Michelo was selected in his place. While in parliament, Hamududu served as a member of Public Accounts Committee and Budget Estimates Committee and was its chairman for seven years.

SS Ben Dearg

SS "Ben Dearg" also known as the "Thomas Alexander", "Etoile Polaire", "Daily Express" and the "Turcoman". The Castle-class trawler was originally built in 1920 for the United Kingdom Admiralty as the "Thomas Alexander", and served most of its life as a trawler in French and English fisheries. It was renamed as "Ben Dearg" in 1936 and was requisitioned as a minesweeper in World War II in 1939 by the British Admiralty.
The iron hulled trawler arrived in Albany in 1949.
The single screw steamer was coal burning, with a single ended boiler that generated 180lbs. per square inch of pressure of steam. Both "Ben Dearg" and the sister vessel "Commiles" were considered to be obsolete and unsuitable for fishing in the Great Australian Bight by 1951, and were looking for fishing grounds closer to Albany which they could trawl safely.
An attempt was made to sell the vessel by Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited in February 1954.
Following the liquidation of Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited, the trawler was sold to Krasnostein and Company, a company based in Perth, in June 1954. It was advertised later in the year for £8000.
The single screw steamer was scuttled on 14 April 1956 off Ben Dearg Beach near Swarbricks Beach, between Herald Point and Islet Point along the coast to the east of Albany in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, very close to the coal hulk "Margaret".
The ship's propeller is on display outside the Western Australian Museum, Albany.

South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-210-282

South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-210-282 was a historic bridge in rural Turner County, South Dakota, carrying 461st Avenue across the East Fork Vermillion River southwest of Centerville. Built in 1909, it was a well-preserved example of bridges built for the county by the Iowa Bridge Company. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The bridge's original Pratt through main span was replaced by a steel girder span in 2009-10.
Description and history.
South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-210-282 was located about west and south of Centerville, carrying 461st Avenue over the East Fork Vermillion River just north of 296th Street. It was a three-span structure, with timber-framed approach spans on either side of a central Pratt through truss. The main span was , and rested on steel tubular piers, while the outermost supports were timber crib abutments. The truss elements were riveted together, and the bridge's deck support consisted of two layers of wooden planking set on timber beams laid over steel I-beams, which were riveted to hangar plates on the trusses.
The bridge was built in 1909 by the Iowa Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The county had a contract with that company to provide its steel truss bridges between 1905 and 1911, apparently as part of a common but illegal practice of "pooling", in which companies divided the state into areas where they did not compete against one another. This bridge was a typical example of the company's work. It was replaced between 2009 and 2010.

Tennis Pro Tours

Until the draw of Open tennis in 1968, the usual format for the handful of playing pros (outlaws beyond the boundary of traditional amateur tourneys) was a tour of one-night stands, across the United States and sometimes other countries as well. The champion of the previous tour went head-to-head against a challenger, most often the leading amateur who had turn pro. Whoever the promoter, he lured the leading amateur with a guarantee against a percentage of gate receipts, making a similar type of deal with the champion and generally paying the others' salaries. There were tournament series with point systems for the complete field of pros in 1946, 1959 and 1960 and there were also World Championship tours in these same three years involving only a few pros. The last World Championship tour was held in 1963 and from 1964 onwards a tournament series with a point system determined the number one pro. Some smaller tours continued to be held from 1964 onwards, as there had been since the 1930's era, but lacking the king-of-the hill aspect.
There were occasionally important tournament series which were referred to as establishing full field rankings. In 1946, there was a professional tournament series linked by a points system won by Riggs, which he relied upon as evidence of his mastery of the entire pro field. In 1959/1960, Kramer established a series of 15 tournaments around the world linked by a point system which provided a full field ranking of all the contract professionals, with Hoad emerging as world No. 1. In 1960, Kramer again established a tournament series with a point system, but the final results are unknown. In 1964, the pros established a world wide series of tournaments with a points system, and a world champion was named as a result, Ken Rosewall. This system continued in subsequent years.

Richard Fairgray

Richard Fairgray (born 1985) is a New Zealand born author and illustrator, working primarily in comics and children's books. He draws and colors and animates his work, in spite of being legally blind, with 3% vision in one eye and none in the other.
Career.
Richard’s works are best known in New Zealand and Australia where he has over 200 published titles. His comic series "Blastosaurus" (2008) became widely known in New Zealand when it was launched as the first locally produced monthly comic title. His picture books for children have been published all over the world by multiple publishers including Scholastic, Penguin/Random House and Sky Pony Press.
Richard was born in Auckland New Zealand and lived there until he was 31, with brief stints in Australia in his early 20s. His mother was a high school teacher. Richard learnt to read and write by the time he was 3 and immediately began making books in his spare time.
When Richard was seven he wrote his first comic book. Once again it featured a ghost being lonely and sad, but this time it was an original character - Ghost Ghost. Richard completed the book and had it photocopied at his school library, and sold at a school athletics day. Over the next decade Richard continued to produce comics, but rarely released any of them.
In 2001 Richard was part of the inaugural Class Comedians program as part of the NZ International Comedy Festival. Richard had never performed stand up before, but found his dry sense of humor and flat performance worked far better on stage than it did in person. He won one of the awards from the program and went on to perform stand up semi regularly through college, appearing occasionally on TV and being featured in a documentary focused on how terrible the quality of comedy had become in New Zealand.
It was through this that Richard was able to take his comic production to the next level, using his minor fame to get sponsorship and sell advertising in his books, allowing him to go suddenly from print runs of a few hundred to a few thousand. It was in 2002 that Richard first started selling his books at the Armageddon Expo.
Over the next 16 years Richard had booths at over 200 shows in New Zealand and Australia, as well as being a guest at San Diego Comic Con and the London Film and Comic Con in 2010 and 2012 respectively.
Richard graduated in 2007, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Elam School of Fine Arts and a Post Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching from the University of Auckland, he took the summer to direct a self funded feature film.
In 2010 Richard was flown to San Diego Comic Con to launch Blastosaurus under the American Original imprint of Top Cow Comics, but the book was misprinted by the publisher. The mis-printed version was not released and Richard went home to relaunch the comic in New Zealand instead, through his company Square Planet Comics.
In 2012, "Blastosaurus" was relaunched in New Zealand, this time with Terry Jones contributing as a part time co-writer. The title quickly gained a much larger audience, selling well through bookstores, comic stores, to libraries and schools, as well as through conventions and online.
Over the next 5 years, "Blastosaurus" remained the highest selling New Zealand comic, selling thousands of copies of every volume, as well as convention specials, activity books, spinoff comic strips and even a toy. By the time Richard left New Zealand and shut down his publishing efforts there, there were over 50 Blastosaurus titles available, none of which still in their first printing.
In 2017 Richard moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comics outside of the tiny New Zealand market. Blastosaurus has been picked up by Golden Apple Books, restarting the series from scratch with his new collaborator Paul Eiding (known for his acting work in video games and television). The series will launch in March 2018 at WonderCon, then become a monthly series later in the year.

Goldener Hahn

The Goldener Hahn, also known as the Golden Cockerel, is a ceremonial wine goblet on display in the Historical City Hall of Münster. The goblet is gifted for use by important guests of the city, and its shape pays homage to the history of Münster, Germany.
Design.
The goblet is a gilded silver vessel shaped in the form of a cockerel. According to Münsterian legend, a cockerel saved the city when a rooster flew to a high point in the city, an act which caused a besieging army (which had been attempting to starve the city into submission) to lose hope that the city could be easily taken. As such, cockerels became strongly associated with the history of the city. The goblet itself was created in the 17th century in Nuremberg, Germany and given as a gift to Münster. The goblet, which holds one bottle of wine, is offered to important guests of the city. The goblet is currently on display in the Historical City Hall of Münster.

20 Years Paranoid

20 Years Paranoid is a concert tour by American-Scottish alternative rock group Garbage, to mark the twentieth anniversary of their second album "Version 2.0". The title also references the album's second single "I Think I'm Paranoid", and the promotional poster is redolent of the album's orange jacket artwork. The tour was preceded in June by a special 20th anniversary edition of "Version 2.0", which was re-mastered in late 2017. Garbage will perform the album in its entirety as well as all the B-sides recorded and released during the album's promotional cycle spanning the years 1998–2000.
Tour announcement.
The commemorative tour was initially announced in September 2017 with a single headline show confirmed in London. Further European dates, including a "homecoming" concerts in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a show at Paris Bataclan, were announced the following February. Before the first shows were announced, Shirley Manson told "Variety" in mid 2017 that "We’re thinking of doing a "Version 2.0" anniversary tour [to mark the album’s 20th anniversary] with all of the album tracks and B-sides, so there will be a lot of songs that we have not even played before that we’ll be trying next year." North American dates were announced in April, with Mexican shows following in July.
Upon the announcement of the tour, Shirley Manson stated: ""Version 2.0" was a very significant record for us and we know our fans feel the same way about it too. This should be a very special night for us all". Manson later told "Hot Press": "Revisiting the b-sides has been interesting because some of them were literally written in an afternoon and then forgotten about until now. One of them, 'Lick the Pavement' is this un-thought out, un-tampered with burst of energy. There's also a version of Big Star’s 'Thirteen', which Alex Chilton said was his favourite cover of any of his songs. It's not a pat on the head... it's a fucking medal with a garland of flowers beneath it. I mean, Big Star... it doesn't get any cooler than that!"
Garbage preempted the tour with a short set at the Electric Picnic festival in Republic of Ireland on Sunday 2 September. The band preceded Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic, George Ezra, Picture This and The Prodigy. The tour was also supplemented by two festival shows in North America: CalJam in San Bernardino, CA preceding Tenacious D, Iggy Pop with Post Pop Depression and Foo Fighters, and ended their run at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey, Mexico, preceding Sammy Hagar, Whitesnake and Guns N' Roses.
Setlists.
An orchestral sample, pitch-shifted and slowed down preceded the band onstage, where they opened with b-sides "Afterglow" and "Deadwood". These, alongside "13x Forever", are live debuts on this tour. Album tracks intersperse b-sides throughout, peaking the main set with three of their biggest songs. Deep cuts such as "Wicked Ways", "Medication", "Sleep Together" and "Dumb" had not been performed by the band in almost twenty years. "Wicked Ways" is mashed-up with a section from Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus", "13x Forever" ends on a part from The Kinks' "Tired of Waiting for You", while "You Look So Fine" features an extended outro of lyrics from Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams". Further into the run Shirley adlibbed from Siouxsie and the Banshees "Happy House" on "Sleep Together". Some of the songs are preceded with pop-cultural reference samples triggered to lead in the music. These include dialogue from movies such as "Natural Born Killers", "To Have and Have Not", "Sex, Lies, and Videotape", "", "Blade Runner", "All About Eve", "The Conversation", "The Graduate", "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" and "The Crow". The encore consists of album centrepiece "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" and a cover version of David Bowie's "Starman", which is scheduled for vinyl release later in 2018.
The band rehearsed around 25 songs for the tour. At both London shows, "Starman" was substituted for "No Horses" and "Cherry Lips", which continued on as the closing songs for the rest of the tour. Some fan requests were taken at points, including "Beautiful Garbage" tracks "Cup of Coffee" and "Parade". Late into the run, the band performed "#1 Crush" and "Only Happy When it Rains" in lieu of "No Horses".
Reviews.
 The opening night in Edinburgh was slightly marred with some sound issues, which Chris Mackinnon, writing for the "Edinburgh Evening News", commented "despite the odd hiccup, it was a fine outing". He also noted, "THIS could be the very definition of risk: A celebration of possibly your most lauded album, in your home-town. On the 1st night of a tour. But it totally paid off."

Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube

The Peabody Bookshop and Beer Stube was a fixture in the Mount Vernon section of Baltimore, Maryland for over 50 years.
There was a crowded, dusty bookshop in front, and a crowded room in the back where customers could get beer and a sandwich. There was a piano on one wall, mounted animal heads, wooden tables carved with the names of patrons. At 10:00 PM, Dantini the Magnificent would do his 15-minute magic show.
The bookshop also served as an art gallery for local artists.
Location.
Located at 913 N. Charles Street, the Peabody was within walking distance of the Walters Art Gallery, the George Peabody Library, the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore's Washington Monument, and the Brexton Hotel.
Weisberger years.
Brothers Hugo and Siegfried Weisberger, Austrian immigrants, started the bookshop in 1922, during Prohibition. Siegfried became sole owner in 1931, when Hugo died.
This was an early example of a bookshop with its own beer bar, and possibly the very first such in the US.
Weisberger abandoned the Peabody in 1954, convinced by long time patron H. L. Mencken, that the "Age of the Boob" had arrived, and people were no longer interested in "books and ideals and culture. They only want dollars."
When Siegfried walked away from "100,000 volumes nobody wants to read", the news was covered across the nation, from Detroit to Phoenix, Arizona; Wilmington, Delaware to Santa Cruz, California.
Interregnum.
The Peabody didn't stay closed. It reopened under the ownership of Paul P. Adler and Irving
Mindess, later in 1954, and remained popular with students from the University of Maryland
Rose Hayes years.
The oft-married Rose Boyajian Smith Pettus Hayes took ownership of the shop in 1957 and ran it until she died in 1986.
Rose added a second bar upstairs, and was active in preserving other Baltimore properties, including revitalizing the Brexton Hotel
In the 70's the Peabody hosted Saturday film festivals.
In 1979, the Peabody suffered the loss of two long-time performers: singer–violinist Max Rathje who knew every regular's favorite song, and Vincent Cierkes, popularly known as “Dantini the Magnificent."
The shop closed not long after Rose's death.
End.
The building at 913 North Charles Street was demolished in 1997, to make way for a parking lot.
In fiction.
Natalie Standiford based Carmichael's Bookshop, in "How to Say Goodbye in Robot" on the Peabody Bookshop.

FS Class E.470

The FS Class E.470 was an electric locomotive class of the state-owned Italian railway Ferrovie dello Stato. It was used on the Italian three-phase test line from Rome-Sulmona especially in express train service. After the end of the trial operation in 1945, the locomotives were scrapped, and no locomotive of the class has been preserved.
Background.
The operating experience with the northern Italian three-phase network running at 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz threw up several problems. With increasing power demands, the voltage was too low and the direct drive to the axles risked overloading the traction motors.
Therefore, it was decided to try a trial route, which would be electrified with a 10 kV, 45 Hz three-phase power system. This had the advantage that power plants could be used with industrial frequency. It would be a test track with steep gradients and small radius curves. The Rome - Sulmona route was selected for the test.
The Class E.470 differed from earlier three-phase locomotives in two respects. The traction motors were supplied through a transformer and they drove through reduction gears to two dummy shafts, which were coupled to the driving wheels with the usual side rod drive. 
For the experiment, the following locomotives were provided:
In addition, there was a locomotive, FS Class E.471, with a rotary converter.
History of the locomotives.
The Class E.470 locomotives were built by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB) at Vado Ligure and bore a strong resemblance to FS Class E.431, including the use of pole pantographs. However, they could be distinguished from the E.431 by the presence of the oil cooler for the transformer and the dummy shafts on the drive triangle. After construction, the locomotives were tested on a section of the Modane - Turin railway line. 
The locomotives were assigned from 1925 to 1928 the depot at Bussoleno. After 1928 they were transferred to the depot at Rome (San Lorenzo) to operate on the line from Rome to Sulmona. After 1935, they were relocated to the depot at Sulmona. 
Overall, the operation with 10 kV, 45 Hz, three-phase did not bring particularly positive results. Fewer substations were required but there were more difficulties in the operation of the double overhead contact line, so that maintenance costs were high. For the latter reason, the line was rebuilt in 1945, after heavy damage in World War II, with 3 kV direct current (DC).
E.470.001 was scrapped in July 1947 at Turin. In December 1947, E.470.002 was scrapped and the other two machines disappeared in the same year. Among the negative results of the test operation was the out-dated equipment of locomotives with rod drive. The electric locomotives with DC drive had a better control and fewer operational difficulties. 
For this reason, the experimental three-phase operation on the Rome - Sulmona line was not seen as a success.
Construction.
Mechanical.
The Class E.470 had a 1ʹD1ʹ wheel arrangement. The outermost of the four driven axles were connected to Zara bogies. The drive and mechanical equipment was derived from the FS E.431. As there were sometimes difficulties in this class with overloading of the drive motors, those of the E.470 were put higher and worked via a gear transmission on a jackshaft. This resulted in a more flexible connection and fewer starting difficulties of the engines. From the jackshaft, the force was transmitted to the axles via a triangle and coupling rods, as with the FS E.431.
Originally, the four locomotives were equipped with rod pantographs. These were later replaced with pantographs analogous to those of Class FS E.432, probably to suit the higher voltage. In this case, a tubular construction was erected on two stems to support the current collector, a construction designed to achieve greater distance for bridging dead parts of the overhead lines.
Electrical.
Like Class FS E.431, the E.470 also had four-speed electrical equipment. The current, taken from the overhead line and stepped down by the transformer with the optimum power factor, was transferred to the traction motors for propulsion. The four fixed speeds were obtained by switching between 6 or 8 poles on the motors and by parallel or cascade connection. Intermediate speeds were achieved by using a liquid rheostat, which allowed uniform acceleration when starting and when changing connections. The mode of action was analogous to the three-phase locomotives for 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz. The main transformer was oil cooled. It supplied 1,000 V to the traction motors and had an additional winding at 110 V for auxiliaries.

Robert Stiegler

Robert Stiegler (1938–1990) was a Chicago filmmaker and photographer, whose work grew out of the approaches to photography and design taught at the Institute of Design (ID) in the 1960s and 1970s. Stiegler received his Bachelor's degree in 1960 and his Master's degree in 1970 from ID, where he studied under Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind and was part of a group of students that included Barbara Crane, Kenneth Josephson, Tom Rago, and Richard Nickel. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the George Eastman House, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and the University of Illinois Chicago. His films "Traffic" (1960), "Capitulation" (1965), "Licht Spiel Nur 1" (1967), and "Full Circle" (1968) are housed at the Chicago Film Archives. 
Biography.
Robert Stiegler lived in Chicago his entire life as a photographer and filmmaker. During his artistic career he became best known for his street documentation, nature photography, positive and negative abstractions, and films.
Stiegler studied with Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind from 1956-1960 at the Institute of Design, as well as working for other Chicago photographers such as Vince Maselli, and Morton Goldsholl Design Associates in the early 1960s.
In 1966, Stiegler took a professorship at the University of Illinois at Chicago. There, he headed the Photography Department, becoming a key figure in establishing the program that exists today. Stiegler taught at the university until his death in 1990.
Photography career.
Stiegler received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Illinois Arts Council.
Gallery 400 at the University of Illinois at Chicago mounted a retrospective of his work in 1992. Stiegler's work was included in an exhibition of more than fifty photographs by students of ID professors Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at Stephen Daiter Gallery in 2010. Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago exhibited his work "Chicago, 1974," alongside other Chicago photographers, and filmmakers during the CITY SELF exhibition in 2014. The California Museum of Photography showcased a retrospective of photography in Chicago in honor of Charles Desmarais in 2016. The exhibition, The Chicago Gift Revisited, displayed Stiegler’s work with pieces from twenty-two other Chicago-based photographers. Stiegler's work was showcased at Art Basel in 2017, represented by the Corbett vs. Dempsey.
The Library of Congress holds Stiegler's photograph "State Street", Chicago (1973) in its collection. Pieces in the AIC collection include "Chicago Circus" (1976), "Temple of Amon, Luxor Eg." (1981), "Untitled" (1965), and "Untitled," (1971).
Film career.
Robert Stiegler’s practice included both photography and filmmaking. During his time at Institute of Design (ID) he experimented with film, creating multiple works exploring abstraction, and negative exposure.
Out of the Vault: Robert Stiegler – Light Play, showcased a collection of his film works including "Traffic" (1960), "Capitulation" (1965), "Licht Spiel Nur" (1967), "Full Circle" (1968). Each work was shown on 16mm film. This program of films highlights the influence of Moholy-Nagy’s teachings on his work, in particular his use of light and interest in formal experimentation.

Victualling Inshore Craft

The Victualling Inshore Craft, or VIC, was a type of auxiliary vessel built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. The VIC was modelled on the Clyde puffer, and over 100 were built during the conflict.
Background.
During the First World War the Royal Navy had need of an auxiliary vessel suitable for lightering supplies to its ships in a variety of settings, often with insufficient, or completely without, shore facilities. Numerous civilian vessels were requisitioned, but the type found most suitable was the Clyde puffer. This was a small, coal-fired, steam ship, with a comparatively large hold and equipped with a derrick for unloading. The puffers were employed ferrying all manner of supplies around the Firth of Clyde and Scotland's west coast, where small communities had limited, or no, harbour facilities.
Design.
With the outbreak of the Second World War, and the decline in numbers of the puffers during the 1930s, led the Admiralty to order the Victualling Inshore Craft, to a design based on two recent puffers, the Hay boats "Anzac" and "Lascar". 
These were both coal-fired and steam-powered, limiting the pressure on supplies of fuel oil and diesel, though later VICs were diesel-powered. 
The puffers were typically divided into "shorehead" (or coastal) boats, with a maximum length of 66 ft, and "outside" (sea-going) boats, of 80 ft. The shorehead boats were within the dimensions of the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal sealocks, making it possible for them to enter the inland waterway system, though the outside boats were more suited to the Atlantic conditions off the west coast.
Construction.
Some 107 VICs were ordered by the Admiralty; of these four were later cancelled, and four others were unfinished at the war's end, being completed for merchant service. Of the 99 in RN service, 63 were of the coastal (66 ft) type, and 36 (mostly later) of the sea-going (80 ft) type. The majority, 88, were steam-powered, while 11 (9 coastal, and 2 sea-going) had diesel engines.
While the puffer was a Scottish design, the Clyde shipyards were fully occupied with building and repairing ships for the Merchant and the Royal Navys, so the VICs were built at river and canal yards in England. The main yards involved were Dunston, of Thorne, South Yorkshire (40 in total built) and Pimblotts of Northwich (28). Other yards employed were S&amp;D Brown, of Hull; Watson, of Gainsborough; Pollock, of Faversham; Richards, of Lowestoft; Harker, of Knottingley; Goole Shipbuilding and Rowhedge Ironworks.
Service history.
The VICs were employed at RN harbours and anchorages around the coast of Britain, lightering all manner of supplies as needed. Their largely unsung work was nonetheless vital to the smooth running of naval operations.
With the war's end the VICs were sold into merchant service, many being employed on the Clyde into the late 1940s and 50's.

FS Class E.471

The FS Class E.471 locomotives were prototype three-phase AC electric locomotives designed for the Italian State Railways (FS). They constituted the first Italian experiment in using a phase converter. The final goal was to power them with single-phase alternating current, constituting the first case of a European locomotive of this type designed according to modern criteria. However, the difficulty of the development, and political interference, led to the abandonment of the project.
History.
In 1928, following the experience acquired in the three-phase high-voltage (10 kV) AC operation with FS Class E.470, a new locomotive of was built, which was supposed to represent the ultimate development of three-phase traction. It was called E.471, and it had the same 1′D1′ wheel arrangement as E.470, but it was technically different. Designed by the famous engineer Kálmán Kandó and built in the plant of Construzioni Elettro Meccaniche di Saronno (CEMSA), it was aimed at the future development of three-phase traction. According to the research of the engineer the project was not developed by the FS but autonomously by CEMSA thanks to the collaboration it had established with Kandó.
According to some oral testimonies, after management changes at the Material and Traction Service of FS due to the advent of Fascism in Italy, the project was judged "an error of the engineer Donati" and the test results were held to be unsatisfactory. Ten locomotives had been ordered but the project was terminated early and only one was actually built. On the other hand, Mascherpa provided an impressive documentation from which it seems that, at the end of the test runs, a tractive effort corresponding to that envisaged was achieved. Rather, the real reason for the termination was the hostility of the new FS leadership to the engineer Alfredo Donati (former director of the Special Electrification Unit of the General Directorate of FS) who was deported following the appointment of the extraordinary commissioner .
The success of direct current experiments, favoured by the new railway management, meant that the E.471 remained at the prototype stage and never entered regular service.
Technical details.
These were rotary converter locomotives and the long-term aim was to run them from a single-phase supply. For the tests, they were run from a three-phase supply at either 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz or 10 kV 45 Hz.
Current collection was made by a pair of twin-collector bow collectors. Mechanical drive from the two frame-mounted traction motors to the wheels was by means of a Kandó triangle drive and coupling rods.

Life.
He was born in Glasgow on 6 October 1847 the son of William Primrose and his wife, Annie Ure, both from wealthy merchant-miller families. The family lived at 53 King Street in the Tradeston district.
He joined the family flour milling business of William Primrose &amp; Co.
He died at his home, Redholme in Dumbreck, on 29 June 1924 and was buried in Craigton Cemetery in south-west Glasgow near Bellahouston Park. The grave lies in the dense area to the south. It is in the first inner row north of the south path, facing south onto his parents' grave.
Politics.
His politics were firmly Unionist/Conservative in outlook.
His first political role was as a member of Govan police Commission.
He became a town councillor in 1886 representing Kingston Ward. From 1891 he was a magistrate and from 1896 a senior magistrate, and was responsible for organising the new fire station at Ingram Street.
He was appointed Lord Provost of Glasgow in November 1902, replacing Sir Samuel Chisholm, 1st Baronet. His Private Secretary was John Smith Samuel.
He was created Baronet of Redholme, Dumbreck in the Parish of Govan, in the County of the City of Glasgow on the occasion of the visit of King Edward VII to Glasgow in 1903.
He was replaced as Lord Provost in 1905 by Sir William Bilsland.
Family.
Primrose married three times: firstly in 1877 to Margaret Jane Adam; secondly in 1887 to Joanna (Anna) Wylie; thirdly in 1915 to Muriel Pilling daughter of Edwin Pilling.
He had one child by his first marriage, William Louis Primrose, who became 2nd Baronet on his death.
His maternal uncle was John Ure, Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1880 to 1883.
Lady Joanna ("Anna") Ure Primrose (nee Wylie) was known as a philanthropist in her own right.

Episcopal Seminary of Fiesole

The Episcopal Seminary of Fiesole () is a former Roman Catholic seminary in Fiesole, Italy. Founded in the 17th century, the seminary was run by the Diocese of Fiesole until it was closed in 1970. Today, the seminary retains several pieces of historically significant art and library collections.
History.
Plans for a seminary originated with Francesco Cattani, the Bishop of Fiesole, in 1585. He intended to open the seminary in the Oratory of Santa Maria a Ponterosso, in the Florentine "comune" of Figline e Incisa Valdarno. However, a dispute over ownership of the oratory, which lasted until 1641, arose between the bishop and Pope Urban VIII. Eventually, possession of the oratory was returned to the diocese, but the seminary was established in its current location.
The seminary at Fiesole was founded in 1637 by Bishop Lorenzo della Robbia, with the intention of training priests in the newly formed precepts of the Council of Trent. Pope Urban VIII instituted the seminary's two years later.
Curriculum.
Della Robbia, who was educated at the Jesuit Roman College, designed the seminary's curriculum to include writing and grammar (as many of the arriving students would be illiterate), humanities (which meant history and poetry), rhetoric, philosophy, cases of conscience, and singing. This departed from the subjects of study prescribed by the Catechism of the Council of Trent, as it did not include the study of Sacred Scripture or administration of the Sacraments other than Confession. While academic theology was taught informally, the primary focus of the theological curriculum was pastoral .
Though the seminary was diocesan in nature (rather than religious), there was a strong influence of the Society of Jesus on the curriculum, as indicated by the fact that a large percentage of the library's collection was written by Jesuit authors and that many of the faculty were Jesuit-trained, resulting in a Jesuit bent to the theology taught. While not as rigorous, the Fiesole seminary's curriculum was influenced by the Jesuit "Ratio Studiorum", which was significantly more rigorous than the standard curriculum of other diocesan seminaries at the time. Graduating students of the seminary even participated in the annual Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius until the 17th century.
This Jesuit influence appears to have waned after the end of Bishop della Robbia's episcopate. While he was bishop, the connection between the seminary and the Society of Jesus seems to have been atypically stronger than that between the Society and other diocesan seminaries worldwide and even in Italy, where the connection was strongest.
Facilities.
The building, constructed under Lorenzo della Robbia, the final descendant of the prominent Della Robbia family, was smaller than it stands today. It was expanded in 1697 by Bishop Filippo Neri degli Altoviti and in 1726 by Bishop Luigi Maria Strozzi. The building encloses the western side of the Piazza Mino, the main piazza of Fiesole, on which the Cathedral of Fiesole also resides. Beneath the building are ruins of an ancient Roman forum, which were discovered during construction.
In 1782, an altarpiece which dates to 1520 and was created by Giovanni della Robbia was moved from the Church of Saint Peter in the Petrognano "frazione" of Barberino Val d'Elsa and installed in the eighteenth century chapel. It depicts the Virgin Mary crowned by angels and amidst Saints Peter, Donatus, John the Baptist, and Romulus. On the bottom is a nativity scene of Saint John the Baptist, Saint Peter being released from prison, Saint Romulus and a well, and Saint Donatus and a wolf. In addition, there is a work by Luciano Guarnieri titled , which consists of 45 panels depicting the life of Jesus Christ. There is also a tabernacle by Amalia Ciardi Duprè.
Over the years, many of Fiesole's bishops supported the seminary. Scientific equipment for studying physics, chemistry, and natural history were added in the nineteenth century. A library was also established with the donation of Bishop Luigi Maria Strozzi's library in 1721. The collection was then supplemented by the donation of Angelo Maria Bandini's personal collection in 1803.
For this reason, the seminary became one of the most important places of education in the area. While the vast majority of its graduates were priests incardinated in the Diocese of Fiesole, it did educate some priests from neighboring dioceses, particularly from the Archdiocese of Florence, in addition to laymen. Among the many students of the Fiesole seminary was the future Cardinal Antonio Innocenti.
Operations of the seminary were discontinued in 1970.

Caesar (1825 ship)

Caesar was launched in 1825 on the Thames River. She sailed between England and the East Indies under a license from the British East India Company (EIC). In 1832-33 she made one voyage under charter to the EIC). Later in 1833 she again sailed to India and wrecked.
Career.
In November 1824 an advertisement appeared in "Oriental Herald and Journal of General Literature" for the ship "Caesar", of 700 tons (bm), to be launched in January 1824 and to sail in March for Madras. The advertisement also stated that "Caesar" was "built expressly for the conveyance of Passengers, having the moulds of a Frigate". She would also carry a surgeon.
"Caesar" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1826 with T. O. Watt, master, Johnson, owner, and trade London–Calcutta. Captain Thomas A. Watt was "Caesar"s first master, and in her he made five voyages. He died in 1834. 
"Caesar" left Deal on 20 June 1825 on her maiden voyage, bound for the Cape of Good Hope, Madras, and Bengal. She was at Madeira on 15 July, and the Cape on 24 September. She arrived at Bengal on 23 November. 
EIC voyage: Captain Henry Thompson sailed from The Downs on 12 July 1832, bound for Madras and Bengal. "Caesar" reached Madras on 24 October and arrived at Calcutta on 10 November. Homeward bound, she left Bengal on 10 January 1833, reached Saint Helena on 15 March, and arrived at The Downs on 2 May.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1833 shows "Caesar"s master changing from Thompson to T. Surden, and her trade from London–Calcutta to London–Madras.
Fate.
"Caesar", Surflen, master, was sailing from London to India when she wrecked on 9 October 1833 on Grand River Reef, Mauritius. She had intended to replenish her supply of water. Her passengers and crew were saved, as was the greater part of her stores and cargo, though in damaged state. On 28 October she was sold for £2600 for breaking up.

Auwahi Dryland Forest Restoration Project

The Auwahi Dryland Forest Restoration Project has produced a substantial forest on the southwestern slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui. The mostly volunteer-based restoration focuses on the 4,000-foot elevation range.
History.
Pre-contact dryland forest ecosystems were reduced to less than five percent of their original range by clearing, grazing and invasive species in the late 1800s. The wood went to fuel the boilers at sugarcane mills and to make charcoal. By the early 1900s, the land was almost totally bereft of `ohi`a and koa trees. Kikuyu grass was imported in the 1940s and became pervasive.
Restoration was initiated in 1997 by fencing a 10-acre area of Ulupalakua Ranch, using U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service funds. It was led by retired United States Geological Survey biologist Art Medeiros.
In June 2003, the Leeward Haleakala Watershed Restoration Partnership was formed and supported the project. The partnership brought eight large landowners (holding 43,715 acres) together to better manage the watershed on Haleakala's southwestern rift zone.
In 2012, native cover increased from 3 percent to 82 percent by 2012 within the project area. 14 of 22 native tree species and six of seven native shrub species had successfully reproduced in restoration plots. 99% were native 'o'hia", Coprosma foliosa, Osteomeles anthyllidifolia, Chamaesyce celastoides, Nestegis sandwicensis" and nonnative "Bocconia frutescens". Stem counts had increased from 12.4 to 135.0/100 m2, and native species diversity increased from 2.4 to 6.6/100 m2. Reproducing species included two types of sandalwood – iliahi and iliahialoe. Mauila and hao (also the word for iron in the Hawaiian language) were present.
Habitat.
More than 50 native species are found in the Auwahi region, including six endangered and five of concern.
Native tree species are susceptible to "fusarium oxysporum", a vascular wilt fungus that is fatal to trees of all sizes.
Goals.
Goals include:
Process.
Reforestation areas are fenced, and feral pigs, goats and axis deer are removed to prevent them from eating saplings and destroying habitat. Next, herbicide is applied to remove invasive plant species. Then 'a'ali'i are planted to prevent invasives from reclaiming the area. After the 'a'ali'i have grown to height of six or more feet, other native tree sapling are planted.
The project organizes monthly site visits carrying 20 to 30 volunteers. Volunteers plant saplings, gather seeds and pull weeds.

John Benjamin Graham

John Benjamin Graham (8 March 1813 – 8 November 1876) was an English settler in the early days of South Australia, who became very wealthy thanks to his mining interests, then left the colony, but not before establishing a mansion for many years known as "Graham's Castle".
History.
Graham grew up in Sheffield, England, and at age eighteen was apprenticed to an upholsterer in London. At his employer's urging and with £250 of his money to invest as well as £40 of his own, he emigrated to South Australia aboard "Recovery", arriving in September 1839. He found work with an Adelaide ironmonger, but soon went into business on his own account and was quite successful.
Around 1845, after the discovery of copper at Burra Burra, he invested all his savings in South Australian Mining Association ("Snobs") shares, which repaid him handsomely: soon he was S.A.M.A.'s largest shareholder, with £1,090 in £5 shares, roughly 9% of the original total shareholding of £12,320, having presumably purchased additional scrip from early profit takers.
Directors (all major shareholders) were Charles Beck, James Bunce, John Benjamin Graham, John Bentham Neales, William Paxton, William Peacock, Charles Septimus Penny, Emanuel Solomon, and Samuel Stocks, jun., with (later Sir) Henry Ayers as secretary.
In two years he was in receipt of £16,000 in dividends per annum, tens of millions of dollars in today's currency.
Prospect House.
In 1846 Graham purchased a property, on the Lower North Road (now Prospect Road) in the suburb of Prospect, previously owned by John and Maria Richmond.
He erected a 3-metre-high stone fence, and engaged architect Thomas Price to build for him an opulent mansion of 30 rooms, dwarfing every other pile in the city, including Government House.
Tenders were called on 22 August 1846 to build a high limestone wall around four acres of the property and three weeks later tenders were invited from various trades to build the mansion, followed by tenders for coachhouse, and stables.
It is likely, but not certain, that the Richmonds' cottage was retained, perhaps as servants' quarters.
Prospect House was Adelaide's first Gothic Revival mansion, and designed to be impressive. It was box-like of two storeys, the upper floor being of a smaller plan than the ground floor. It reputedly had thirty rooms, and was built of coursed local limestone. It had a wide west-facing veranda with a return to its north side.
Rooms on the upper floor opened via French windows with green-painted cedar shutters onto a crenellated open balcony. The veranda was also enclosed by shutters.
The flat roof, which was accessible from below and surrounded by a crenellated parapet, gave a panoramic view of the Adelaide plains from the sea to the Adelaide Hills and beyond.
Even the chimneys were crenellated, reinforcing the popular epithet "castle".
The interior was spacious and impressive, with polished oak and cedar panelling and marble inlays. The thirty rooms included a wide hall and a dining room with eight doors running on little wheels which fitted into recesses in the wall, and a panelled partition which folded back to make two large rooms into an immense one.
The building, which dwarfed every other mansion in the colony, including Government House, loudly proclaimed its owner's wealth, though not necessarily exemplifying good taste.
A. T. Saunders warns against confusing Prospect House with John Howard Angas's Prospect Lodge, on the Torrens Road corner, Bowden, opposite the Park Lands.
Return to England.
Around 1847 he brought his mother and stepfather, John Adams, out to South Australia, and had them living with him at Prospect House, presumably as caretakers against the event of Graham's return to Adelaide; this notion is supported by an entry in his diary.
In January 1848 he left Adelaide aboard "Gellert" for Calcutta, and toured the East and Europe before settling in England.
From 1848 to 1867 Henry Ayers served as his agent in South Australia, followed by his brothers-in-law Frank and Henry Rymill.
He returned briefly to Adelaide aboard "European" in March 1858, when he resigned as a director of the Burra Burra Association.
Investments in South Australia included the Canowie and Curnamona Stations in 1869, which were sold in 1926.
He purchased a Schloss in , near Heidelberg, where he resided from around 1855, and was known for his gracious and lavish hospitality.
He died at his residence, Warrior Square, St Leonards-on-Sea on 8 November 1876, with an estate estimated at £200,000.
Family.
Graham married Louisa Rymill, eldest daughter of Robert Rymill, of Brompton Row, near London, on 10 April 1849. Louisa was a sister of Henry and Frank Rymill; it was at her urging that they arrived in Adelaide aboard "Caucasian" in October 1855.
Later history of "Graham's Castle".
Graham's stepfather John Adams remained at Prospect House, hosting a Christmas party for Sunday School children at Prospect House, and a fete in honor of the consecration of Christ Church, which was recorded on watercolors by S. T. Gill. A similar occasion the following year was marred by a self-selected elite who blocked the Sunday School teachers from the dining room until all the drinks and party food was gone. Adams announced his imminent return to England in June 1853. He organised a sale of Graham's movable assets including his pipe organ, which was purchased for Christ Church, North Adelaide, and later went to the Norwood Baptist Church.
"Graham's Castle" had the reputation of being haunted by a sailor, supposedly an earlier owner of the property. It turned out rabbits were living under the floorboards, giving rise to occasional unexplained noises.
By the 20th century suburbia had encroached and the "Castle" was just an unmarketable curiosity off Braund Road, Prospect, and in the way of progress, and was demolished in September 2001. No plan of "Prospect House" survives and apart from a few street names, no evidence of its existence remains.

Caesar was launched in 1800 on the Thames River. She spent her short career as a West Indiaman, sailing between London and Jamaica until she wrecked in 1810.
"Caesar" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1800 with J. Bruce, master, R. Dale, owner, and trade London–Jamaica. James Bunce acquired a letter of marque for "Cæsar" on 22 September 1800. The size of her crew and the number of guns suggests that she may initially have been a privateer.
Captain John Fowler acquired a letter of marque for "Caesar" on 15 December 1803, and Captain James Shand acquired one on 27 January 1807.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1810 showed "Caesar"s master as Shand, her owner as A. Henry, and her trade as London–Jamaica. The entry for her also carried the notation "LOST".
"Caesar" was wrecked on 8 February 1810 off the South Foreland as she was returning to London from Jamaica.

List of accolades received by Caché

"Caché", also known as "Hidden", is a 2005 psychological thriller film written and directed by Michael Haneke and starring Daniel Auteuil, Juliette Binoche and Maurice Bénichou. The plot follows an upper-class French couple, Georges (Auteuil) and Anne (Binoche), who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance. Shot in Paris and Vienna in 2004, the film is a co-production of France, Austria, Germany and Italy. The French government's decades-long denial of the 1961 Seine River massacre was an inspiration to the story.
"Caché" competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where polled critics and festival audiences considered it a frontrunner. Ultimately, the jury awarded Haneke Best Director. At the European Film Awards, it competed with the Cannes Palme d'Or winner, "L'Enfant" by the Dardenne brothers, with "Caché" winning five awards, including Best Film.
The film was submitted as Austria's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards, but was disqualified as French is not predominantly the language of Austria. As Haneke is Austrian, it would have also been disqualified if France or any other country had submitted it. The exclusion sparked criticism, with Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker calling it "unfortunate" and saying the story demanded the film be in French. Austria's Fachverband der Audiovisions und Filmindustrie protested the criteria, and Haneke, whose previous French-language "The Piano Teacher" was not disqualified as the Austrian submission, also called the rules "really stupid". Academy member Mark Johnson responded, "We're in the process right now of considering some very radical changes".

Lords of Chaos (film)

Lords of Chaos is a 2018 horror-thriller film directed by Jonas Åkerlund and written by Dennis Magnusson and Åkerlund. Adapted from the 1998 book of the same name, the film is a historical fiction account of the early 1990s Norwegian black metal scene told from the perspective of Mayhem co-founder Euronymous. It stars Rory Culkin as Euronymous, Emory Cohen as Varg Vikernes, Jack Kilmer as Dead, and Sky Ferreira as Ann-Marit.
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2018. It was released in the United States on 8 February 2019 by Gunpowder &amp; Sky, in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2019 by Arrow Films and in Sweden on 5 April 2019 by Nordisk Film. It received positive reviews from critics, but was met with polarizing reception from audiences within the metal community.
Plot.
In 1987, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and Manheim on drums. Manheim leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, during their live shows cutting himself and bleeding on the audience and throwing pig heads at the "posers". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on.
While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken to the morgue, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band.
Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete ("Hell"), which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the "Black Circle". After being mocked by Euronymous, the very anti-Christian Varg burns down a local church. When challenged by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying.
Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, "De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas". A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises.
After a wave of church burnings begins, Faust brutally kills a gay man, leading police to link black-metallers to the crimes. Helvete is shut down and Varg is arrested as prime suspect after an interview with a Bergen newspaper in which he boasts of the crimes. He is soon released for lack of evidence. Varg tells Euronymous that he is leaving Mayhem and is starting his own record label. Euronymous reveals that the "skull piece" necklaces were fakes, and that he never intended anyone to follow through on his angry rhetoric, which infuriates Varg.
While packing away things in the shop, Euronymous angrily rants to a peer about wanting to kill Varg, but later calms down and sends him a contract to release their music rights to him. Varg, having heard that Euronymous was making death threats against him, travels to Oslo in the early morning of August 10 to confront him. Telling Euronymous he wants to sign the contract, he enters his apartment and, after a brief conversation, stabs him. Euronymous pleads for his life, but Varg follows him through the apartment to the stairwell outside and stabs him to death. The next day, the news of Euronymous' murder spreads throughout Norway and Varg is soon arrested. He is sent to prison for a maximum of 21 years, guilty of both the murder of Euronymous and the burning of several churches. In a voice-over, Euronymous tells the audience not to feel sorry for him, that he enjoyed his life and invented a new sub-genre of metal.
Production.
"Lords of Chaos" is based on the 1998 book of the same name. Originally, Japanese director Sion Sono was set to direct a film based on the book, with Jackson Rathbone starring as Varg Vikernes. It would have been Sono's first English-language film. The screenplay was written by Hans Fjellestad (who was earlier reported to be the film's director as well), Ryan Page, Adam Parfrey (the book's publisher), and Sono. In July 2009, Sono stated that filming (in Norway) would begin in August or September and end in December. The film was set to be released in 2010. It was later announced that Rathbone would no longer be playing Vikernes due to scheduling conflicts.
In May 2015, it was announced that former Bathory drummer and film director Jonas Åkerlund would direct the film. The film was set to shoot in the fall of 2015 in Norway, but for unknown reasons, filming did not begin until 2016. The film was shot in Oslo, Norway, with live performance scenes shot in Budapest, Hungary. The live sequences shoot also included filming for the Metallica music video "ManUNkind", starring the cast of the film.
Vikernes, who had already expressed criticisms against the book, stated in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel in 2016 that when approached by the filmmakers, he, along with Mayhem and Darkthrone, denied the rights for their music to be used in the film. In a 2018 interview, Åkerlund said that they had in fact secured the rights to Mayhem's music.
Historical accuracy.
Åkerlund described the film as "about truth and lies". In an interview for "Dazed", it was reported that Åkerlund consulted "original band merch ... was granted access to key police reports as well as detailed photos of Euronymous's record store Helvete, and the house the band camped out in. ... Åkerlund even used real locations for exterior shots of, among others, Euronymous's flat and a rebuilt church that Vikernes burnt down in Holmenkollen."
Culkin said that he prepared for his role by consulting several associates of Euronymous: "They almost always compared him to a mythological creature: one person said he was kind of like a gnome and another said he was like an evil elf. Because he was small dude but confident in himself and he has this clan around him, people really embellished and lionised him."
In one scene from the film, Dead anachronistically declares, "We are Lords of Chaos." The name actually originates from the unrelated American criminal group whose name was adopted for the book "Lords of Chaos". The book's scope was not focused solely on the Norwegian black metal scene.
Jack Kilmer's performance as the band's frontman Dead has received praise for being the most accurate portrayal in the film, with the exception of one scene where he has a cat hanging from his room. The real Dead never killed any cats but did chase them off for fun. Some criticisms were made that the Live in Jessheim scene jumps to Dead's suicide, given a whole year had passed in between both events and Dead and Euronymous' subsequent falling out and animosity was never portrayed apart from one scene in which Euronymous mockingly waves a shotgun in front of Dead and suggests he shoots himself. The time Varg claims Dead stabbed Euronymous was never portrayed in the film.
Release and reception.
The first screening on "Lords of Chaos" was held at the Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2018 in Park City, Utah. In October 2018, a first-quarter 2019 release window for the United States was announced, with Arrow Films securing the distribution rights in the United Kingdom, where it was released on 29 March 2019. The film was released in the US in theaters on 8 February 2019 and via video on demand on 22 February 2019 by Gunpowder &amp; Sky. In Sweden, it was released on 5 April 2019 by Nordisk Film.
Reactions from the depicted.
Attila Csihar, in a January 2019 interview, stated that the official opinion of the current Mayhem members regarding the film and its creators is a "big fuck you". He pointed out that the film was based on a book and only focused on Mayhem during the 1990s, not the whole black metal scene at the time. He confirmed that some Tormentor songs appear in the film and that he himself is played by his son, Arion Csihar. Attila himself was present during the shooting of the church burning scenes. In a later interview in May 2019, he offered a more nuanced critique of the film, saying that while the film is based on reality, he disagrees with how the story was presented, and that the characters were portrayed as "idiots".
Vikernes harshly criticised the film as "made-up crap", objecting to being portrayed by a Jewish actor and to plot elements, calling the depiction "character murder".
Necrobutcher has provided ambivalent reactions after viewing the film: he praised the production values and the wardrobe accuracy, but noted that the movie was "sad" and "not a good movie", and that viewing the murder scenes had an emotional effect on him. He also addressed Mayhem's initial negative reaction to the announcement of the film, and explained that their intense negative reaction was largely because the band has only been approached after production on the film has started, and that he gave permission to use Mayhem's music in the film after seeing a rough cut. Ultimately he noted that the film had very little impact on the band.
Critical reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, "Lords of Chaos" holds an approval rating of 72% based on 76 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critics consensus states: ""Lords of Chaos" presents a grimly compelling dramatization of a real-life music scene whose aggressively nihilistic aesthetic spilled over into fatal acts of violence." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
In his review for "The Hollywood Reporter", Justin Lowe praised "Lords of Chaos" as a "vibrant biopic" that "provokes both awe and repulsion". Amy Nicholson of "Variety" wrote, "Despite Åkerlund's refusal to lionize these immature kids, "Lords of Chaos" is tremendous fun. ... he can also get great performances out of a young cast". "IndieWire"s Michael Nordine awarded the film a B rating and wrote ""Lords of Chaos" is frequently unpleasant but oddly compelling—not least because Åkerlund ensures that the film never takes itself as seriously as its subjects did."
Conversely, "The A.V. Club"s Katie Rife decried that "Åkerlund's understanding [of the Norwegian black metal scene] is more like contempt". Kory Grow of "Rolling Stone" wrote: "perhaps the film's worst sin is its tone ... It's not fun. It's not sad. A lot of the time, it's not even all that interesting." Robert Ham of "Consequence" wrote that "Instead of courting [the black metal] audience, or trying to find some middle ground where [Åkerlund] celebrates the music while rightfully disparaging the actions of some of its worst figureheads, he punches down with a smirk and dismisses the birth of a genre as the product of misspent youth."
"The New York Times" Manohla Dargis criticised the film for "never establish[ing] a coherent or interesting point of view. The tone unproductively veers from the goofy to the creepy, which creates a sense that [Åkerlund] was still figuring it out in the editing." Robert Abele of the "Los Angeles Times" summarized, "Ultimately it all adds up to a hodgepodge of styles and attitudes with hardly any insight into what made this corrosive clique so magnetic to its adherents."

Transport vessels for the British expedition to the Red Sea (1801)

For the British expedition to the Red Sea (1801) the British government hired a number of transport vessels.
The transports supported Major-General Sir David Baird's expedition in 1801 to the Red Sea. Baird was in command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived in time for the battle of Alexandria. Captain Hardie of "Shah Kaikusroo" was appointed Commodore of the fleet of country ships.
Most of the transports were "country ships". Country ships were vessels that were registered in ports of British India such as Bombay and Calcutta, and that traded around India, with Southeast Asia, and China, but that did not sail to England without special authorization from the EIC. In addition, some were "regular ships" of the British East India Company (EIC), and some were "extra ships". Regular ships were on a long term contract with the EIC, and extra ships were vessels the EIC had chartered for one or more voyages.
The data in the table below comes primarily from an 1814 report from a Select Committee of the House of Commons of the British Parliament, which provided the data only on country ships, giving the names of a large number of vessels, and their burthen (bm).
Also, transliteration of non-English names shows no consistency across sources, making it extremely difficult to try to find more information about the vessels in question.
EIC naval vessels.
The following vessels were listed in the 1814 report as country ships, but were actually vessels of the EIC's navy, the Bombay Marine.

Colleen Dishon

Colleen Dishon, also known as Koky Dishon, (12 June 1924 – 28 December 2004), was an American journalist for the "Chicago Tribune" in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Dishon was the first woman listed in the "Chicago Tribune" masthead and, at one time, the most influential female journalist at the newspaper.
Personal.
Colleen "Koky" Dishon was born prematurely in a rural cabin in Kentucky in 1924. She grew up in Zanesville, Ohio with her mother and five siblings. On a hot summer day in 1941, her mother told her to do something so she wouldn't notice the heat. That is when she got her first job at her town's newspaper. Dishon met her husband, Bob Dishon, while they worked for the "Columbus Dispatch". They both eventually quit their jobs there and began working at the "Daily News" in Chicago, Illinois. Bob was a city desk reporter and Koky was in feature sections there. Colleen and Bob worked closely together and were allies in the workplace. Bob and Koky were married 54 years when Koky died in 2004.
Career.
Koky Dishon got her first job at the age of 16 at the Zanesville, Ohio newspaper. "I cleaned myself up and walked into town," she said. "I had no idea where I was going. When I stopped, I was at a building where the Zanesville newspapers were published. I didn't know a soul there, but I walked up the stairs and stood in the doorway and told the editor 'I want to work', and they gave me an old typewriter in the back of the room and told me to do the baby column." In 1975, Dishon was hired by the "Chicago Tribune" to change the Tempo section into a general features section in the newspaper. While revamping the section, she changed the Tempo heading to "closed for remodeling." That is when Dishon created Tempo Women, a column aimed at working women. "There was nothing in the paper that showed (women) they weren't alone in their struggle, that others were in the same boat," she said. The very successful column's final version was named Womenews to appeal to working women under the age of 35. Womanews was distributed to the two million readers of the Chicago Tribune's Sunday paper. In seven years, Koky was promoted to associate editor, making her the first woman on the "Chicago Tribune" masthead. She maintained control of all departments outside of news and sports. Koky Dishon retired from the "Chicago Tribune" in 1994, at 70 years old. James D. Squires, the editor who had promoted her, said, "There have been two great creative people at the "Chicago Tribune". The first was Col. (Robert) McCormick who put together a world-recognized newspaper, and the second was Koky Dishon who created sections people wanted to read." The Tribune Managing Editor, Ann Marie Lipinski, stated, " Whether you have ever worked for Koky, or ever heard her name before today, if you are a newspaper reader, you are the beneficiary of her genius. She defined modern features coverage with her work in Chicago, creating the so-called 'sectional revolution' in American newspapers."
After her retirement, Koky contributed to the industry by becoming an editorial consultant at a weekly newspaper by Network Chicago WTTW public television. She has also helped the South Bend Tribune, in Indiana, in transitioning from an evening to morning publication. She also co-authored a book on the designing of newspapers sections.
Impact.
When Koky Dishon worked for the "Chicago Tribune", she influenced the newspaper so much that they called it the "sectional revolution." She combined real news and flare to the article, making it fun and appealing to the readers. When Dishon was hired, she thought the news columns were stylistically stodgy and out of date. She created the Tempo section into more of a general interest section, bringing in more male readers. "She may have been the most innovative soft news editor in my generation," says former Tribune editor James Squires, "I don't know anyone who led more changes than Koky Dishon. She was a fireball of a person who went forward every day with happiness and drive. I never saw her not smiling and having a good time." 
There are scholarships in Dishon's name for journalism students across America. The Ohio University foundation received a $850,000 donation from the estate of Koky and Bob Dishon. "The generous endowment will allow us to award highly competitive scholarships to a number of journalism students," the Dean of Scripps College of Communication, Gregory J. Shepherd said, "I am very grateful to Bob and Koky Dishon for establishing this living legacy." From this scholarship, an incoming freshman pursuing a journalism major will be given $8,000.
Awards.
Distinguished Service in Journalism (1979) – Dishon received this award from Ohio State University for 17 sections she created at the "Chicago Tribune" that revolutionized how newspaper sections were produced.
Journalism Hall of Fame (1997)
Lifetime Achievement Award (2001) – Awarded to Dishon for her career "spent in joyful defiance of boxes and the range of restrictions that so long defined women's work in journalism."
Milwaukee Press Club Hall of Fame (2002) – Dishon was inducted into the Milwaukee Press Club Hall of Fame in 2002, awarded to honor the men and women who shaped and changed journalism in the region.

Li Kelin (; 14 September 1942 – 1 February 2018) was a Chinese business executive who served as President of China Shipping Group, often considered the "father of the Chinese container shipping industry".
Biography.
Li was born in Zhenhai District, Zhejiang on 14 September 1942. He graduated from Shanghai Maritime University, joined Shanghai Shipping Corporation in 1961, and was promoted to captain in 1971. He later became General Manager of Shanghai Shipping Corporation and then Deputy CEO of COSCO Group.
In 1997, Li was appointed the first CEO of the newly established China Shipping Group. The global shipping industry was experiencing a severe downturn because of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and Li seized the opportunity to purchase and order many ships at very low costs. When the market recovered, China Shipping profited handsomely from his deals.
When the shipping industry had another downturn in 2002 following the September 11 attacks, Li again decided to expand the company fleet when the cost was low. He spent 2 billion purchasing container ships and ordered 80,000 shipping containers. When the market recovered again, China Shipping made a profit of US$600 million.
Li retired from China Shipping in 2006. In 2008, he became chairman of Hainan PO Shipping, which went bankrupt in 2013.
On 1 February 2018, Li died at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai.

Six Foot Track Marathon

The Six Foot Track Marathon is a 45 km annual foot race along the Six Foot Track, a historical trail between Katoomba and the Jenolan Caves and is described as "the toughest marathon in Australia". The ultramarathon was founded in 1984 to mark the centenary of the track, and raises funds for the Rural Fire Service &amp; Six Foot Track Heritage Trust. The women's race record of 3:34:50 is held by Hanny Allston and the men's record of 3:14:14 is held by Stuart Gibson.
It is held in March and runners must be prepared to tackle temperatures of over 30 degrees, river crossings and extreme changes in elevation in addition to the normal challenges of a marathon.
Track profile.
The Six Foot Track descends from Nellies Glen into Megalong Valley before crossing Coxs River and ascending Black Ridge. It continues along the range for ~15 km before sharply descending to Jenolan. It gains 1528m over the course of the race with a maximum elevation of 1200m at Black Range and minimum of 400m at the Coxs River crossing.

Asclepias hirtella

Asclepias hirtella, commonly called the tall green milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed genus and dogbane family (Apocynaceae). It is native to Canada and the United States, where its range is concentrated in the Midwest and Upper South.
Description.
"Asclepias hirtella" is a tall perennial, reaching 3 feet in height. It has many narrow, linear leaves that are produced alternately on the stem. Its flowers in lateral umbels with slender peduncles. Each stem may have 2 to 10 umbels and each umbel may have 30 to 100 flowers. The flowers lack horns and are greenish to slightly purplish in color. It flowers June thru Aug. 
This species closely resembles "Asclepias longifolia", and it is occasionally treated to be a subspecies of it. "Asclepias longifolia" is restricted to the Southeastern Coastal Plain, and it differs from "Asclepias hirtella" in its fewer and smaller flower umbels, and its glabrous leaves. 
Habitat.
"Asclepias hirtella" is found in a variety of open habitats, including areas with dry sandy soil, prairies and limestone glades, It can be found in both wet and dry conditions, and it prefers open habitats with full sun. This species is a component of high-quality grassland communities, although it can be found in and disturbed conditions as well. It is considered to be uncommon throughout much of its range.
Distribution.
"Asclepias hirtella" is native to West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin to northerner Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma to south western Kentucky. It is a prairie species native to 13 US states and one Canadian province, but is becoming rare or declining in numbers in parts of its native range. "A. hirtella " is rare in Minnesota and listed as a threatened species in that state, where it occurs in the south eastern corner in mesic prairie habitats.

, provisional designation "" with cometary number 362P, is a Hildian asteroid and rare main-belt comet from the outermost regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 8 April 2008, by astronomers of the Spacewatch program at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. The presumably carbonaceous body has a rotation period of 10.7 hours.
Orbit and classification.
"" is classified as a member of the dynamical Hilda group, as well as a main-belt comet that shows clear cometary activity, which has also been described as a "quasi Hilda comet". Orbital backward integration suggests that it might have been a centaur or trans-Neptunian object that ended its dynamical evolution as a quasi Hilda comet.
It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9–5.1 AU once every 7 years and 11 months (2,883 days; semi-major axis of 3.96 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in October 2001, more than 5 years prior to its official discovery observation by Spacewatch.
"" has a Jupiter Tisserand's parameter (TJ) of 2.926, just below Jewitt's threshold of 3, which serves as a distinction between the main-belt asteroids (TJ larger than 3) and the Jupiter-family comets (TJ between 2 and 3).
Numbering and naming.
This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 16 February 2016 (). As of 2020, it has not been named.
Physical characteristics.
"" is an assumed C-type asteroid.
Rotation period.
In August 2017, a rotational lightcurve of "" was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a small brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude ().
Diameter and albedo.
The "Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link" assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 14.64 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.9. Other estimates, taking into account several published magnitude measurements and a large range of albedo assumptions, estimate a diameter range of 5.5 to 24.7 kilometers.

Rey de Reyes (2018)

The 2018 Rey de Reyes (Spanish for "King of Kings") was a professional wrestling event produced by the Lucha Libre AAA World Wide, or simply AAA, promotion. The 2018 version was the 22nd year in a row that AAA has held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2018, which was won by Rey Escorpión.
In the main event of the reshuffled card El Hijo del Fantasma defeated El Texano Jr. in a "Lucha de Apuestas", or bet match, forcing Texano Jr. to have all his hair shaved off after the match.
Production.
Background.
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican "Lucha Libre", or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's "Rey". Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the'Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual "Reina de Reinas" ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2018 show will be the 22nd Rey de Reyes show in the series.
Storylines.
The 2018 Rey de Reyes show featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as "rudos" in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or faces ("técnicos" in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Pacey Witter

Pacey John Witter (born January 1983) is a fictional character and one of the lead roles from the WB television drama "Dawson's Creek", portrayed by Joshua Jackson.
Fictional biography.
Background.
Pacey Witter is a sarcastic underachiever 15-year-old boy when the show first starts. Constantly labeled by his family as a "black sheep", he has a distant relationship with his emotionally abusive parents. He's been friends with Dawson Leery since his childhood. Pacey has also known Joey his whole life, though they had a bickering relationship until they fall in love as teens.
Season 1.
In season one, 15-year-old Pacey is introduced as Dawson's inconsequent best friend and somewhat the "Bad Boy" type. He falls in love and loses his virginity to his English teacher, Tamara Jacobs (Leann Hunley). When Pacey relays the details of his sexual encounter with Ms. Jacobs to Dawson in a school bathroom, the conversation is overheard by another boy smoking marijuana in the next stall. Rumors quickly begin to spread about the nature of Pacey's relationship with the 36-year-old teacher and the ensuing scandal eventually forces Ms. Jacobs to end their relationship and leave town.
Following his relationship with Tamara, Pacey spends most of his time hanging out with Jen, Dawson and Joey, with who he always had an antagonistic relationship. Forced to partner on a biology project, Pacey and Joey spend a whole day together and Pacey finds himself romantically interested in Joey. He realizes that maybe he could like her and asks Dawson if he can ask Joey out, which forces Dawson to assess his own feelings toward Joey. Pacey kisses Joey, but she turns him down. Pacey also comically enters a beauty pageant and performs a skit from Braveheart.
Season 2.
In season two, Pacey wants to reinvent himself, dying his hair and trying to get close to his longtime crush, Cristy Livingstone, which unfortunately does not work out. He decides to throw his 16th birthday party at the docks in an effort to change the general perception of him, but is dismal as nobody knows it's his party and Dawson forgets his birthday all together – luckily Dawson realizes this and later makes up for it. Pacey goes through a radical change when he meets Andie McPhee, an academic overachiever who is new to Capeside. They come out of the gate sparring and slowly develop a romance, though this progress is halted when Pacey's ex-girlfriend, Tamara, returns to Capeside. Pacey and Tamara kiss, but ultimately part ways and Pacey is able to finally get some closure on his first love. Pacey's low self esteem is boosted by the support and encouragement Andie gives him, and he slowly starts believing that he can do whatever he wishes in life and is able to improve academically.
Pacey and Andie get together and she offers to help Pacey reform his study habits and Pacey begins to do well in school, achieving his first-ever A. The two grow closer, embarking on a sexual relationship as well. Pacey is, at first, overcome with emotion by all of these changes to his life and the lack of predictability that had become the only stable force in his life, but though it terrifies him, comes to terms with how important Andie is to him and how much he loves her. His recent inspiration for changing his life also makes the psychological abuse of his family all the more straining, which culminates in a fishing trip Pacey and Dawson take with their fathers – and Jack, who Pacey invites along in spite of Dawson's jealousy and subsequent ire. Pacey spends the entire trip doing his best to do as his father tells him and stay out of harms way, but is constantly berated for his efforts. At the end of the trip Pacey catches a big fish and wins a competition upon their return to Capeside, but his father manages to ruin the victory by telling Pacey that he probably won't have many more moments like that.
As Andie's mental health begins to suffer due to the strain of caring for her mother and the death of her eldest brother Tim, Pacey becomes concerned for her as well as their future and struggles with what he can do to help Andie. Eventually the pressure starts getting to Andie and she breaks up with Pacey, who is adamant that he not push her away at a time where she needs him and he tells her that he loves her for the first time. Andie suffers a nervous breakdown when she begins to hallucinate that she is seeing her deceased brother, and takes a leave of absence at the end of the season for a stay in a mental health facility. The strained relationship Pacey has with his neglectful and alcoholic father is further explored this season, as well as the effect Andie has on that relationship. When Andie leaves for the mental health facility to get better, Pacey misses her terribly and his abrasive father makes a snide comment about Andie being crazy, for which Pacey hits and scolds him. Near the end of the season, Andie tells Pacey's father over the phone to give Pacey a hug for her, and his father does. This ultimately leads to a touching moment — it seems that they can start to put their past behind them and, for the first time, Pacey looks for some support from his father and actually gets it.
Season 3.
After a summer apart, Pacey is anxiously awaiting the return of Andie, all the while encouraging Dawson to make things happen with Eve. After Dawson rejects Joey he asks Pacey to look out for her for a while. Wanting to surprise Andie, Pacey brings Joey along to pick Andie up early at the facility where's she has been treated over the summer. Andie acts very distant from Pacey from the moment she sees him and eventually tells him that she had an affair and, devastated, Pacey breaks up with her. Pacey buys and works on restoring a wrecked boat, occupying himself with the project to get over Andie. While Andie dating a guy who she says attacked her briefly bring her and Pacey together, he tells her that they cannot get back together. He doesn't love her like that anymore.
After Pacey is deemed the failure again by his family, he pursues a purely sexual relationship with Jen. Both agree that there will be no emotion involved whatsoever.

With Pacey's father too sick to work anymore because of multiple health problems from his life-long alcoholism, Pacey's brother, Doug, takes over as acting police chief of Capeside.

Series finale.
Five years later, a 25-year-old Pacey is now the proprietor of The Icehouse, a successful restaurant in Capeside bearing the same name as the one Joey's family used to operate. Even though he's a successful chef, he feels empty and he's still unhappy. He is having an affair with a married woman and is still the same lost boy.
In the occasion of Gale Leery's wedding, everyone returns to Capeside. The five friends reunite at Pacey's restaurant to reminisce about the past. Dawson did a TV series about their teen years. Joey is now a junior editor living in New York and she is in a serious relationship with a writer.
During Gail's wedding reception, Joey and Pacey kiss (reigniting lingering feelings between the two), but the moment is interrupted when Jen collapses. It is later discovered that Jen has a deadly heart condition. The two spend time together in Capeside while Jen is hospitalized. In the midst of their romantic entanglements, Joey, Dawson, Jack, and Pacey are brought together at the Ice House, to say goodbye to Jen, who dies from pulmonary congestion.
At the same time, Joey ends her relationship with her boyfriend after Jen tells her that her dying wish is to Joey to stop running of her true love. Though she loves Dawson, she acknowledges that he is her soulmate who is tied to her childhood, a love that is pure and eternally innocent. She also cannot deny she is still in love with Pacey. After Jen's death, she decides to stop running and declares herself to him, telling him she always loved him and for most of her life that love scared her.
In the epilogue, Joey and Pacey watch Dawson's semi-autobiographical television series The Creek in their apartment before calling up Dawson together, where they discover he is going to meet his hero, Steven Spielberg. They have renewed their romantic relationship, and the series ends with them as a couple living together in New York.
Reception.
First introduced as Dawson's best friend and comic relief, Pacey starts to appear as a romantic hero through the course of season two. The season explores Pacey's relationship with his abusive father and the impact it has on his self-loathing complex. But it's his relationship with new girl in town, Andie Mcphee that brings depth to his story. Creator Kevin Williamson says that "was sort of An Officer and a Gentleman storyline where the show really became Pacey's Pond" and "he started to care about himself and made an effort to be a better person for the love of a good woman and ultimately for himself".
But in season three, the course of Dawson's creek and Pacey' story changes completely. Pacey and Andie break-up in the second episode "Homecoming", and so does Joey and Dawson. Through the course of the first half of the season, Pacey and Joey starts to build a friendship. But what becomes clear after a while is that the slow- burn plot is actually a love story. They fall in love and it's forbidden. They both love Dawson and don't know how to deal with the situation. Season three's showrunner Greg Berlanti says "I would get Pacey with Joey and have a King Arthur–esque story — Dawson being King Arthur — exploring what happens when Lancelot and Guinevere fall in love," Berlanti said. "[Joey and Pacey] always had such wonderful chemistry, the two of them — they have a Tracy and Hepburn quality that I liked writing for.". The story restored the show and the love triangle would only be resolved in the last episode, when Joey tells Pacey she aways loved him and can't keep running from it.
Joshua Jackson was acclaimed for his charismatic performance. In a review of The Guardian a critic said "not only did Joshua Jackson have more credible chemistry with Katie Holmes, whom he briefly dated in real life, but Pacey quickly eclipsed Dawson as both the series’ most relatable character and its moral centre.". Jezebel said "their screwball dynamic, coupled with actors Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson’s untapped chemistry and an intricately plotted courtship subverted everything expected of the show. It unsurprisingly still resonates with so many millennial women who grew up watching the series. There was a time when we had come for the angst, but now we were staying for the romance.". For the role, Jackson was the only member of the cast to win 3 Teen Choice Awards for Best Actor in a series.
His relationship with Joey is usually listed as one of the best love stories in any show ever. They were included in TV Guide's list of "The Best TV Couples of All Time" and Harper's Bazaar placed them in 7 in their "70 of the Best TV Couples of All Time" list. They are also in MsMojo's lists "Top 10 Cutest Teen Drama Couples" and "Top 10 Iconic TV Couples of the 2000s". And also featured on the Buzzfeed's "19 Friends-To-Lovers TV Couples That Stole Fans' Hearts" list.

Grégoire Kamanga

Grégoire Kamanga (20 October 1927 – ?) was a Congolese politician who twice served as Minister of Public Health of the Republic of the Congo. He also founded the Coalition Kasaïenne and served as Provincial President of Unite-Kasaïenne.
Biography.
Grégoire Kamanga was born on 20 October 1927 to a Bakete family. He undertook six years of medical assistant courses at Lovanium University. Though he performed well as a student, he did not pursue a university degree to become a doctor, to the disappointment of his teachers. He was married. In 1959 in Luluabourg Kamanga founded the Coalition Kasaïenne (COAKA) party to unify several minor tribes of Kasaï Province—including the Babindji, Basala Mpasu, and Bena Mputa—against the political threat posed by the dominant Lulua and Baluba. In the Congo's first elections the following year he won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies on a COAKA ticket with 20,050 preferential votes, representing the Lulua constituency. In Parliament's pre-independence discussions, he suggested that the country be named the "Republic of Zaire". He served as Minister of Public Health in Patrice Lumumba's government until he was dismissed by presidential order on 12 September 1960.
Kamanga was arrested by the central government on 14 February 1961. Two days later he was flown to Bakwanga alongside six other Lumumba supporters. They were all tried by a tribunal of customary chiefs for committing "crimes against the [Baluba] people." The following day Kamanga was sentenced to five years imprisonment, but he was released in mid-March. Following his return to the capital in April he created and became chief of the autonomous state of Unite-Kasaïenne. He took part in the Coquilhatville Conference in May that resulted in the Congolese government's recognition of the internal territory. After intense negotiation among various political factions a new Congolese central government was formed on 2 August under Cyrille Adoula, and Kamanga reassumed his position as Minister of Public Health. In July 1962 Adoula reshuffled his government and Kamanga was dismissed from his post. Unite-Kasaïenne was statutorily recognised as a province in August. Kamanga was elected provincial president by the provincial assembly 12 to four on 10 September, and served in that office until July 1963. During his tenure he frequently disregarded the expressed opinions of the provincial assembly and reportedly partook in diamond trafficking.

<doc id="56584135" url="?curid=56584135" title="Edwin Rivera Paz">
Edwin Rivera Paz

Edwin Rivera Paz, (ca. 1989 – July 9, 2017), was a Honduran journalist living in southern Veracruz, Mexico who worked as the lead cameraman for the Honduran television program "Los Verduleros" on Hable Como Habla, who died in Acayucan, Veracruz, Mexico from multiple gunshot wounds from two unidentified assailants on a motorcycle with no known motives in broad daylight. Rivera received several death threats in his home country not long before he was murdered.
Life and career.
Edwin Rivera Paz lived with his half-brother, Pablo Rivera Cabrera, in the San Diego neighborhood, near Mexican Federal Highway 185 that connects Minatitlán and Coatzacoalcos.
At the time of his murder, Rivera resided in southern Veracruz seeking political asylum out of fear for his life.
Rivera and his colleague Igor Padilla worked together on the comedy program "Los Verduleros" at the television station Hable Como Habla (HCH). While Rivera lived in Acayucan, he worked on an independent project about the challenges Central American migrants and refugees faced in Mexico, which included organized crime group violence; Rivera was making photo and video reports about the lives of other refugees in the city.
Death.
In late January 2017, Rivera fled Honduras for Acayucan after his colleague, Padilla, was murdered in San Pedro Sula. While in Acayucan, two unidentified assailants on a motorcycle chased Rivera for several blocks, beat and then repeatedly shot him on the afternoon of July 9, 2017, at approximately 2 in the afternoon.
Rivera's half-brother identified his body after the attack.
At the time of Rivera's murder, he had been living in southern Veracruz for several months, seeking political asylum to the Mexican Aid Commission To Refugees (COMAR).
Context.
Igor Padilla, a colleague of Rivera's, was shot in January by four men wearing police uniforms in the northern Honduras city of San Pedro Sula.
The men who murdered Padilla are suspected members of Mara 18.
Padilla had covered crime and also hosted the humorous television show "Los Verduleros", which Rivera was the cameraman for.
Soon after Padilla's murder, Rivera fled his home country for Acayucan in fear for his life. It is not immediately clear exactly how long Rivera had been in Acayucan before his death; the town lies on a heavily used route for migrants fleeing violence who are preyed on by organized crime groups.
Paz was the seventh journalist killed this year in Mexico, where more than 100 reporters have been murdered since 2000.
More journalists have been murdered in Veracruz than the rest of Mexico; it is now the deadliest region for media in the Western hemisphere.
The situation is almost as dangerous as Rivera's native Honduras, where 69 journalists have been killed since 2003.
Reactions.
The Honduran consul in Mexico asks the state prosecutor to investigate and to not let the crime go unpunished.
Ricardo Sánchez Pérez del Pozo, the Federal Special Prosecutor for Attention to Crimes against Freedom of Expression, expressed that his office had opened a case file for the murder to determine whether it was related to the victim's work as a journalist.
Jorge Morales Vázquez, executive secretary of the Veracruz State Commission for the Care and Protection of Journalists, said the commission was investigating Rivera's reporting as a possible motive but could not provide additional information.
Raul Otoniel Morazan, Honduras' consul general in Veracruz, called in an interview for all levels of the Mexican government to get to the bottom of the killing.
Julian Hernandez, a spokesman for the Honduran police, said, "We are seeking more information about this crime in Mexico to determine if it is related to the murder of Igor Padilla and to see if any criminal gangs from Honduras were involved."
The Mesoamerican Migrant Movement said the circumstances of the death were "worrying" and called on authorities to investigate the case.
Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Irina Bokova, said, "I call for a thorough investigation into this crime. Freedom of expression and freedom of information in the region will remain threatened as long as impunity is allowed to prevail for crimes against journalists and media workers."

Quetelet rings

Quetelet rings are a type of optical interference pattern occurring at an illuminated reflective surface covered by fine particles, such as a dusty mirror. It is named after the astronomer Adolphe Quetelet, who observed the phenomenon and explained its formation. A slight variation of the setup is sometimes referred to as Newton's dusty mirror experiment, since Isaac Newton had already discovered the phenomenon by the end of 17th century, but did not interpret or explain it.
Quetelet rings arise from interference of the light that is first scattered by a particle and then reflected by the surface, with the light that first gets reflected and then scattered by the particle. Contributions of these two paths to the scattering differ by a phase factor that depends on the wavelength and the angles of light incidence and scattering. Depending on the phase difference, these contributions may interfere constructively (contributing to a bright band) or destructively (contributing to a black band). In the case of illumination by white light the patterns produced by different wavelengths are slightly misaligned with each other and that results in a coloring of the rings. The pattern is most noticeable around the reflection image of the light source. The closer the images of the light source and the observer are on the mirror and the closer the particles are to the reflective surface, the broader are the interference fringes.

Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez

Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez (ca. 1941 – January 13, 2018), a Mexican journalist and political columnist in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, was best known for his column in the "Dario de Nuevo Laredo", as well his opinion columns for news websites, before he was murdered.
Personal.
Carlos Domínguez Rodriguez was a 77-year-old journalist who wrote about politics. He was married and had two children, a son and daughter. His son was married and the couple had a child, a grandchild. He resided in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, for most of his life. His body was buried in Nuxco, Tecpan de Galeana, Guerrero, Mexico.
Career.
Rodriguez practiced politically committed journalism for nearly 40 years. Although best known for his political column for the "Dario de Nuevo Laredo", he also reported for the "Noreste Digital" and "Horizonte de Matamoros," which were popular news websites. He was also known for being an independent journalist who lamented on political violence.
Death.
Carlos Domínguez Rodriguez was murdered around 3 p.m. on January 13, 2018. The journalist was attacked while at a stopped traffic light in his Ford Focus. He was taken out of his car and stabbed. Domínguez Rodríguez was later determined to have died from 21 stab wounds to his body. In the aftermath it was not known how many attackers were involved as the men were masked. One of four people in the car, Domínguez Rodríguez was slain in front of his son, daughter-in-law, and grandchild, but only the journalist was attacked.
Rodriguez had been working on controversial political columns, and the motive related to his journalistic work was investigated. Domínguez Rodríguez had not reported receiving any threats or requested security.
The Tamaulipas State Attorney General Irving Barrios announced March 28, 2018 the arrests of six suspects. Two of the six allegedly blocked Domínguez’s Ford, forced him out of the car and stabbed him and four of the six were allegedly involved in the planning. One of the planners was identified as Rodolfo Jorge Alfredo Cantú García, who was the relative of a former mayor who Domínguez Rodríguez had criticized in his articles. Barrios announced that his killing was related to his columns.
Context.
Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez was a political writer who wrote about the city of Nuevo Laredo, the state of Tamaulipas, as well as national Mexican politics. The last murder of a journalist in the state of Tamaulipas was Zamira Esther Bautista on June 20, 2016.
Press freedom organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists insist that the violence has created a self imposed "silence zone" for journalists in order to avoid attacks and murder. Domínguez Rodríguez's political articles were important enough to get him killed in the end and criminal organizations were not involved.
Impact.
A wave of violence towards journalists hit Mexico in 2017, and 10 journalists, including Rodriguez, were murdered within a year. Multiple investigations have been launched to find the source of all of this violence.
Domínguez Rodríguez death was among the first murder of a media worker in Mexico in 2018, as a former editor Jose Gerardo Martinez was killed in Mexico City a week earlier. It added to the wave of violence in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers.
Reactions.
Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, said, "I condemn the assassination of Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez in Mexico and urge the authorities to ensure an effective investigation,” “Bringing journalists’ killers to justice is crucial to end violence against those who defend the public’s right to know."
Tamaulipas Governor Fransisco Garcia de Vaca said, "My condolences to the family of the journalist Carlos Domingues Rodriguez. My commitment to them and the journalistic community of Tamaulipas is that this murder will not go unpunished."
Emmanuel Colombié, the head of Reporters Without Borders Latin America bureau, said, "It is alarming to see that, for Mexico’s journalists, 2018 is beginning as badly as 2017 ended. ... For Carlos’ colleagues, there is no doubt that his assassination is linked to his journalistic work."
Alexandra Ellerbeck, CPJ's North American program coordinator, said, "Mexican authorities must swiftly investigate the murder of Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez, and bring all of those responsible to justice. Until the Mexican government decides to change the pattern of impunity in the country, criminals will continue to get away with killing journalists."
A statement from the General Justice Prosecutor's Office stated, "The state's government will take firm action against any attack on freedom of speech and the work of journalists."

William McSwain

William Miller McSwain (born 1969) was the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from April 6, 2018 to January 22, 2021. He was nominated to the post by President Donald Trump. During his tenure, he frequently engaged in disputes with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner over criminal justice reform policies.
Early life, education, and legal career.
McSwain graduated from Yale University in 1991. After graduating from Yale, he spent four years in the U.S. Marine Corps. as an infantry officer. He commanded a platoon in that role. In 2000, he graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the "Harvard Law Review".
From 2003 to 2006, McSwain was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; the district, based in Philadelphia, covers nine counties (Philadelphia, Montgomery, Delaware, Chester, Berks, Bucks, Lancaster, Lehigh, and Northampton). In 2006, McSwain left the U.S. Attorney's Office to join the law firm Drinker, Biddle &amp; Reath in Center City, Philadelphia. His work principally focused on business litigation and white-collar defense matters, but he attracted attention among Pennsylvania Republicans for representing conservative litigants in cases over issues such as the Boy Scouts of America's exclusion of gay members and the Ten Commandments plaque at the Chester County Courthouse. He was successful in both cases. In published letters, McSwain defended George W. Bush-era "enhanced interrogation techniques" and, in 2016, criticized football player Colin Kaepernick as "uninformed and hypocritical" for his national anthem protests.
United States Attorney.
Nomination.
President Donald Trump nominated McSwain to be the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the nomination was received in the Senate on December 21, 2017. On March 15, 2018, his nomination was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by voice vote. On March 20, 2018, the Senate confirmed McSwain's nomination by voice vote. He was sworn in on April 6, 2018. As a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney, McSwain became a civilian Officer of the United States and may use the style "Honorable" for life (by contrast, Interim U.S. Attorneys do not gain such style).
Tenure.
During his time as U.S. Attorney, McSwain's public office spent $75,138 to put his face on four billboards in Philadelphia, as well as Allentown and Lancaster. The billboards have the slogan "Gun crime = fed time, no parole, every time," with McSwain's face taking up a third of the space on each billboard. The move was controversial because of McSwain's political ambitions and the likelihood that the advertising would increase his name recognition and face recognition.
McSwain sued proposed Safehouse, a harm reduction nonprofit organization attempting to create a supervised injection site to prevent opioid overdose deaths in Philadelphia. The concept of a safe injection site was received with both opposition and support, with 90% of surveyed residents and 63% of business owners and employees in Kensington, the neighborhood of Philadelphia hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, approving the measure. McSwain contended that the 1986 federal "crack house statute" prohibited the establishment of supervised injection sites. He originally lost his case in U.S. District Court, but won on appeal in a 2–1 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued on January 12, 2021. Judge Stephanos Bibas, writing for the majority, held that the 1986 law barred the proposal and that "Safehouse's benevolent motive makes no difference." Citing "Gonzales v. Raich", the majority also held that "even though this drug use will happen locally and Safehouse will welcome visitors for free, its safe-injection site falls within Congress's power to ban interstate commerce in drugs." Judge Jane Richards Roth dissented, "calling the logic behind the ruling 'absurd' and the 30-year-old statute on which it was based — one meant to go after owners and tenants of drug dens — 'nearly incomprehensible.'"
As U.S. Attorney, McSwain often publicly feuded with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner and Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, both Democrats. McSwain called Krasner "soft on crime" and blamed Krasner and his office for a lack of "robust enforcement". The assessments stemmed from Krasner's decision, with Kenny's support, to alter prosecutorial procedure amidst claims of "systemic racism" in the criminal justice system. McSwain further accused him of "lawlessness" and of ignoring "entire sections of the criminal code" after controversial decisions to not prosecute certain crimes, such as non-violent drug offences. He further criticized the D.A.'s office for downgrading charges during prosecutions. McSwain later said that his office had been "picking up the slack" for Krasner and that the U.S. Attorney's Office has prosecuted 70% more violent crime cases than it did the year before Krasner took office due to the latter's "lawlessness." In an interview, in response to rising violent crime rates in Philadelphia, McSwain described the DA's policies as a failed "radical criminal justice experiment on the local level." Upon the announcement of his resignation on January 14, 2020, the District Attorney's office issued a statement saying they hope McSwain's successor has a sense of "humanity."
McSwain criticized Krasner for approving a plea deal with a man who shot and gravely wounded a West Philadelphia shop owner with a AK-47 in the course of an attempted robbery. The plea deal entailed a state sentence of 3½ to 10 years in prison. McSwain's office prosecuted the man separately, under the doctrine of dual sovereignty, and obtained a federal conviction and sentence of 14 years for the shooter.
McSwain pursued federal charges against Black Lives Matters activists who clashed with police during unrest in the summer of 2020.
Resignation.
On January 14, 2021, McSwain announced his resignation, just six days short of the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden. He left office on January 22.
2022 campaign for Governor.
In March 2021, McSwain formed a political action committee, Freedom PA, to commence his bid for Pennsylvania Governor in 2022.
In June 2021, while McSwain was preparing for a bid for Governor of Pennsylvania and vying for Trump's endorsement, McSwain sent a letter to Trump that said his office "received various allegations of voter fraud and election irregularities" and that then-Attorney General William Barr stopped McSwain from making public announcements about the allegations, as well as investigate them. There is no evidence of significant fraud in the 2020 election. Barr disputed McSwain's characterization of his actions and said that McSwain was making these claims to get Trump's support.
McSwain officially launched his gubernatorial campaign on September 13.

Seattle Kraken

The Seattle Kraken are a professional ice hockey team based in Seattle. The Kraken compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference and began play during the league's 2021–22 season. They play their home games at Climate Pledge Arena.
In December 2018, the NHL approved a proposal by Seattle Hockey Partners to grant an expansion franchise to the city of Seattle. In July 2020, the Kraken's name and branding were revealed. The Kraken are the first professional hockey team to play in Seattle since the Seattle Totems of the Western Hockey League played their last game in 1975, and the first Seattle hockey team to compete for the Stanley Cup since the Seattle Metropolitans, who won the cup in 1917 and folded in 1924.
Establishment.
The NHL Board of Governors voted unanimously to approve Seattle's expansion team on December 4, 2018. Seattle will begin play in the 2021–22 season as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference; therefore the Arizona Coyotes will shift from the Pacific Division to the Central Division to balance out the four divisions at eight teams each. An expansion draft was held on July 21, 2021, in a similar manner to a previous expansion draft held in 2017 for the Vegas Golden Knights, who were themselves exempt from the 2021 expansion draft.
On July 23, 2020, the franchise announced their team name, the Seattle Kraken, as well as their team colors, branding, and home jersey. The name came from the Giant Pacific octopus, which is found in the waters of Puget Sound, near Seattle.
On April 30, 2021, the franchise paid the final installment of the $650 million expansion fee, officially making the Seattle Kraken the 32nd team of the NHL.
Team information.
Arena.
The team will play home games at Climate Pledge Arena. The arena, at Seattle Center, is a $930 million redevelopment of the former KeyArena and Seattle Center Coliseum. Amazon.com bought the naming rights to Climate Pledge Arena and chose to name the venue after its environmental goals.
The team's primary practice facility, named the Kraken Community Iceplex, is located at the redeveloped Northgate Mall and opened in September 2021. The facility has three rinks and will be open to the public.
The Kraken's three home preseason games prior to the 2021–22 season will be held at Spokane Arena, Angel of the Winds Arena in Everett, and the accesso ShoWare Center in Kent, which are all home to Western Hockey League (WHL) teams. Tickets will be sold by the host WHL teams.
Broadcasting.
Everett Fitzhugh serves as the team's radio play-by-play announcer. Fitzhugh had previously done play-by-play for the ECHL's Cincinnati Cyclones. He is the first full-time play-by-play announcer of African-American heritage in NHL history. Games are broadcast on 950 KJR with some games on 96.5 KJAQ.
Kraken games are broadcast regionally on Root Sports Northwest for the team's first five seasons. Former Hartford Whalers and Carolina Hurricanes broadcaster John Forslund serves as the team's television play-by-play announcer. J. T. Brown is the television analyst.
Minor league affiliates.
The team's yet-to-be-named minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL) will be based in Palm Desert, California. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and delays in building their new arena, the affiliate will not begin play until the 2022–23 season.
The Charlotte Checkers, the primary AHL affiliate of the Florida Panthers, will also serve as the AHL affiliate for the Kraken during the 2021–22 season due to the delay in the Kraken's AHL team. The Checkers, an independently owned AHL team, had been the affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes while the Kraken's general manager Ron Francis was working for the Hurricanes.
Players and personnel.
Owners.
The team is owned by Seattle Hockey Partners, an organization originally consisting of David Bonderman, Jerry Bruckheimer and Tod Leiweke. Minority owners of the Kraken include Chris Ackerley, Ted Ackerley, Jay Deutsch, Mitch Garber, Adrian Hanauer, Andy Jassy, Len Potter, David Wright, and Jeff Wright.

Linda Proud

Linda Proud (born 1949) is a British author of historical fiction. She is best known for "The Botticelli Trilogy", which is set in late fifteenth-century Florence.
Early life and career.
Proud was born in Hertfordshire and was an only child. As a young girl, she enjoyed making up stories, and at age 14 she discovered the historical fiction of Mary Renault. Renault would become one of her chief influences as a writer.
Proud began her career as a picture researcher in 1971, during which time she developed an interest in the works of Florentine painter Botticelli. She also became interested in and influenced by the work of Renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino. It was during this time that she developed the idea behind "The Botticelli Trilogy" and began researching Renaissance Florence. However, after the digitization of images, she left her career as a picture researcher to begin teaching creative writing to American students at the University of Oxford. She also served as an editor for literary consultancy The Writers Workshop.
Writing career.
Proud's early work primarily included non-fiction books on culture, spirituality, and art. Her first fictional publication, "Knights of the Grail" (1995), is a retelling of the Arthurian legend for children.
Proud finished "A Tabernacle for the Sun" (1997, 2005), the first volume of her trilogy, which was published through Allison &amp; Busby. "A Tabernacle for the Sun" was long-listed for the Mann Booker Prize (1997) and won a Southern Arts bursary and a Hawthornden Castle Fellowship.
In 2000, Proud and her husband founded their own publishing house, Godstow Press, which specializes in publishing works on art and spirituality. All her subsequent historical fiction, including the next two volumes of her trilogy, "Pallas and the Centaur" (2004, 2012) and "The Rebirth of Venus" (2008), has been released under the imprint of Godstow Press. After finishing her trilogy, it was suggested to Proud that she write a book about Cosimo de' Medici, and in 2012 she published "A Gift for the Magus", which serves as a prequel to "The Botticelli Trilogy". "A Gift for the Magus" won a second prize Indie B.R.A.G. Medallion and the Quagga Prize for Independent Literary Fiction. It was also marked as an Editors' Choice book by the Historical Novel Society.
Altogether, the process of writing "The Botticelli Trilogy" took over thirty years. Proud bases much of her writing closely on primary sources. Her writing has been compared to H. F. M. Prescott, Mary Renault, and Marguerite Yourcenar.
In recent years, Proud has lectured on Renaissance philosophy and questioned the boundaries between historians and novelists in "History Today". She has also written several articles and reviews for "Resurgence &amp; Ecologist". She also leads regular writing workshops and gives talks on writing and publishing.
In September 2018 she marked a departure from the Renaissance with the publication of a novel, "Chariot of the Soul", set in Britain on the eve of the Roman invasion.
Personal life.
Proud lives in Oxfordshire with her husband. She is a student of Neoplatonism and Advaita Vedanta, the latter of which she practices on a daily basis.

Danielle Herrington

Danielle Nicole Herrington (born May 26, 1993) is an American model known for her appearances in the "Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue", including the cover of 2018 edition where she became the third African-American woman to appear on the cover — after Tyra Banks (1997) and Beyonce (2007).
Background.
Herrington was raised in Compton, California, but rose to fame after becoming a resident of Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood. Growing up, she attended Gahr High School in Cerritos, California, before dropping out her sophomore year to be homeschooled, so she can focus on her modeling career. Herrington came from a working family. She describes her childhood as normal and says she was focused on school until college.
Career.
Herrington started envisioning herself as a professional model at the age of 8. She attended John Casablancas' modelling school at age 10 or 11 with the encouragement of her mother. She began modelling at age 13, and Herrington was featured in "GQ" in November 2016 before she had 10,000 Instagram followers as an Instagram model on the rise who had already done jobs for Victoria's Secret. She first appeared in the Swimsuit issue in 2017, which she booked four months after moving to New York City to pursue her career at age 21. The 2017 Swimsuit issue photoshoot, which took place in Fiji, was her first major photoshoot. Her first runway performance was her New York Fashion Week debut at the Philipp Plein's spring show in September 2017 along with Irina Shayk and Adriana Lima. She was selected as the SI Swimsuit issue cover model for the 2018 issue, becoming the third black woman to appear on the cover of the Swimsuit Issue—after Tyra Banks (1997) and Beyonce (2007). Herrington shot the 2018 Swimsuit Issue in the Bahamas. She walked the runway for Plein the second time for its Fall 2018 show.

Battle of Yinshan

The Battle of Yinshan (Chinese: 陰山之戰; pinyin: "Yīnshān zhī zhàn") was fought in 630 CE near the Yin mountain range close to the city of Dingxiang (定襄, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Emperor Taizong (598-649) commissioned the famed Tang military officer Li Jing (李靖, 571–649), along with Li Shiji, Wei Xiaojie, Li Daozong, Chai Shao (), and Xue Wanche () to attack forces under the command of Illig Qaghan (Ashina Duobi), leader of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate (also known as the Göktürks), a nomadic confederation of Turkic peoples based in Inner Asia. The battle ended in defeat for the Göktürks and resulted in the dissolution of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, which was eventually replaced by the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Protectorate () in 647 CE after the Tang dynasty definitively conquered the Xueyantuo.
Background.
In 623, The Eastern Turkic Khaganate began a campaign of routine pillaging incursions into Tang territory, while continuing to protect Liang Shidu, who claimed the title of Emperor of Liang. In 626, Li ShiMin succeeded Emperor Gaozu as Emperor Taizong of the Tang. Less than a month later, the Turkic ruler Ashina Duobi (Illig Qaghan) and his nephew, Ashina Shibobi (), invaded Tang territory, advancing all the way to the ancient capital Chang'an, shocking the Tang officials. Emperor Taizong was forced to personally meet with them at the Wei River Bridge outside Chang'an, give them and major Eastern Turkic officials gifts, and promise further tributes. Only after he did so did Ashina Duobi and Ashina Shibobi withdraw.
For the next several years, there was relative peace between the Tang and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Meanwhile, Ashina Duobi's territory suffered two unusually cold winters that led to mass livestock deaths and famine and he was forced to suppress a number of rebellions. By 627, Emperor Taizong contemplated taking advantage of Ashina Duobi's weakened state by launching an attack, but ultimately refrained after his advisers convinced him not to break the peace.
Internal strife within the Eastern Turkic Khaganate continued as vassal tribes became restless under Ashina Duobi's rule. Ashina Duobi and Ashina Shibobi also fell into conflict after the latter was unable to defeat rebellious Xueyantuo and Uyghur vassal tribes. After Ashina Duobi attacked Asina Shibobi's forces in 628, Emperor Taizong, who had sworn to be a blood brother of Ashina Shibobi on a prior occasion, agreed to launch troops to protect Ashina Shibobi—and at the same time use the opportunity to attack Liang Shidu, who by this point was still under the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's protection. Liang Shidu was assassinated in 628, ending the final rival claim to Emperor Taizong's for China's imperial throne. To head off Taizong's efforts to ally with rebellious vassal tribes against him, Ashina Duobi sought long-term peace in the form of a marriage to a Tang princess, which Emperor Taizong did not answer. Instead, he prepared for a major assault on the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, with the major general Li Jing commanding and with the general Zhang Gongjin () assisting Li Jing.
Battle.
In spring 630, Li Jing, employing six separate cavalry formations of nearly 100,000 men along a 1,200 km front, captured the Wuyang Range outside Dingxiang (定襄, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), approaching Ashina Duobi's court. He then sent spies to Ashina Duobi's camp and persuaded a number of his close associates, including Kangsumi (), to surrender (along with Sui's Empress Xiao and her grandson Yang Zhengdao). Li Jing's nighttime assault on the walls of Dingxiang forced Ashina Duobi to withdraw to Iron Mountain (Tieshan) in the Yin Mountains where he offered to submit to Emperor Taizong—but while he was negotiating with the Emperor Taizong's envoy Tang Jian (), he was also considering withdrawing further north of the Gobi Desert. Li Jing and Li Shiji, believing that Ashina Duobi was merely stalling for time, joined their forces and their vanguard, Su Dingfang, attacked Ashina Duobi's encampment on March 27, 630, defeating him and killing his wife (Sui Dynasty's Princess Yicheng). Ashina Duobi fled further to his subordinate khan Ashina Sunishi (), but was soon captured by the Tang generals Li Daozong and Zhang Baoxiang () and delivered to Chang'an. Turkic nobles largely surrendered to Tang, while the Turkic Khaganate's people scattered in three directions—either surrendering to Tang, surrendering to the Xueyantuo, or fleeing west to the Western Turkic Khaganate and the nearby kingdoms such as Qocho, Kucha, and Tuyuhun.
Aftermath.
Emperor Taizong eventually decided to have the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's people settled in the northern prefectures within Tang borders, remaining in tribal form, on lands that were currently not settled. He established four nominal prefectures over Ashina Shibobi's tribes and six nominal prefectures over Ashina Duobi's tribes, with two commandants governing the areas. Ashina Sunishi and another Eastern Turkic Khaganate prince, Ashina Simo (who, in particular, was given the Tang imperial surname Li and therefore also known as Li Simo), were created princes, and a large number of other chieftains were given general ranks; they were settled in or near Chang'an. Emperor Taizong also gave the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's people who possessed Han people as slaves ransoms and had them return those Han slaves to Tang. Also thereafter, Emperor Taizong often requisitioned Turkic cavalry soldiers to supplement regular Tang troops on various campaigns, such as the 634 campaign against Tuyuhun.
Meanwhile, Xueyantuo largely took over Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former territory, with most of Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former vassals submitting to it. Former Eastern Turkic Khaganate's vassals Khitan, Xí (), and Xī () tribes directly submitted to Tang, as did the city-state of Yiwu ().

Sucker Lake (Nipissing District)

Sucker Lake is a lake in geographic La Salle Township and geographic Osborne Township in the Unorganized North Part of Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, about east of the railway point of Diver on the Ontario Northland Railway. It is in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin and is the source of Sucker Creek.
The lake has three unnamed inflows: at the west, arriving from the direction of La Salle Lakes; at the north, arriving from the direction of Serene Lake; at the east, arriving from an unnamed lake. The primary outflow, at the south, is Sucker Creek, which flows via Little Sucker Lake, the Jocko River, and the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River. The lake has one island, at the west.
The southwest shore of the lake, from the unnamed inflow arriving at the west from La Salle Lakes to the Succker Creek outflow at the south, is along the border with Jocko Rivers Provincial Park.
The lake can be accessed from a tertiary road that leads: from Diver northeast to the community of McLaren's Bay on Lake Timiskaming; or, via a subsequent branching tertiary road, southeast to Ontario Highway 63, at a point about halfway between that highway's crossing over the Jocko River and Lake Timiskaming.

Ambulinga Ghat

Ambulinga Ghat is a bathing place depicted in the religious text "Chaitanya Bhagavata", written by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura in the mid-16th century. It is considered one of the holy places of Jaiva Dharma. Ambulinga Ghat is located in the Indian state of West Bengal. "Ambu" means "water" in the Bengali language, and "linga" depicts the Hindu Lord Shiva. 
In the 16th century, the delta-shaped island was found in Chhatrabhog, where the Ganges river flowed in many separate streams. By the 18th century, its tributaries had dried up. The bathing place, or "ghat," is now found in Barashi Village, located in South 24 Parganas district in Mathurapur I, Diamond Harbour subdivision. 
Religious pilgrims consider Ambulinga Ghat a place where Lord Shiva and Mother Ganges are unified. The spiritual leader, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, visited and bathed there in A.D. 1510.

Débora Pérez Volpin

Débora Denise Pérez Volpin (30 December 1967 – 6 February 2018) was an Argentine politician, journalist and television host. She was the host of the news program Todo Noticias since 1996 and the program "Arriba Argentinos" since its inception in 2005.
Childhood and adolescence.
Since she was a child, Pérez Volpin dreamed of studying medicine, influenced by her father who was a director of the Juan A. Fernández Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires. On top of this, she also wanted to pursue a career in social communication sciences. She completed her secondary studies at Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, where she had her first experience in communication. Here, she contributed to the founding of the school magazine. According to Pérez Volpin, this publication was a very prestigious means of information for students.
Career.
After she finished high school, in mid-December, she decided to enroll for the medicine career she would begin in March of the following year. However, she decided to start her career in social communication and when she studied semiology, she realized that her true vocation leaned towards the latter.
Her first job in the media was as a producer on "Radio Belgrano" (), while she was still studying at the university. It was about a magazine with Enrique Vázquez that aired at 7:00 a.m..
She made contributions to graphic media such as the "13/20" magazine for young people.
She worked for associate editors who published magazines such as "Ser Única, Emanuelle," and a whole series of magazines in which she worked as an editor.
She made collaborations for the newspapers "La Nación" and "Clarín".
Producer at Artear.
In 1992, Pérez Volpin joined Artear with a group of young journalists that were working as interns. The entrance requirements were that they have been graduates of a communication school and had some experience in the media. She, like all of the group that had entered, began in production and was under the orders of Ricardo Pipino whose function was to form the new channel that was going to be released, "Todo Noticias".
The first task of Pérez-Volpin was to call the various television channels in Argentina to explain that there would be a news channel, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. When something happened in some locality or city, the channel that was in that locality had to send the coverage of the news to "Artear". During a whole year, she went through different areas of production.
Reporter.
Pérez Volpin's desire was to be a reporter on the street. She earned this position one summer, where she replaced reporters who had taken vacations. She was a reporter for four years where she worked from early in the morning to late at night. Her role was to be on the street with a cameraman and to send the material they produced for another person to edit and then broadcast to the public. Then, she started making mobiles and special reports for "Telenoche".
Host.
In 1996, she became a host of "Todo Noticias". As a host -when she did not do it alone- she worked with José Antonio Gil Vidal, Mario Mazzone, Juan Micelli, Guillermo Lobo, Luis Otero, Santo Biasatti and Marcelo Bonelli.
From 2004 to 2005, she conducted "Síntesis" with Juan Miceli.
Pérez Volpin also worked in "Canal (á)" with the shows "Anecdotario" (2003–2009) and "Entre Paréntesis".
She hosted "Según como se mire" in "Radio Mitre" (2008).
On 25 April 2005 the morning news program "Arriba Argentinos" began, and Pérez Volpin was chosen as a host along with Juan Miceli. Other hosts included Marcelo Bonelli, Marcelo Fiasche, Alejandra Peñalva y Nazarena Di Serio. Said newscast is the most watched in its strip. Her fans created forums on different websites and groups on Facebook where they uploaded photos and videos of the host.
On 21 June 2017, she quit to "Canal 13" after 24 years −12 years as the host of the program- and "Todo Noticias" to be a candidate to the Legislature for the city of Buenos Aires.
Politics.
In 2017, she entered politics and was elected legislator of the City of Buenos Aires as part of the "Evolución" front led by Martín Lousteau. She came third in the election with 12% of the votes and took office on 10 December of that year but she was only able to participate in one session of the legislature on 22 December 2017, when the budget of the City of Buenos Aires was approved, before her death.
Death.
On Monday, 5 February 2018, she entered the "Trinidad Sanatorium" of the city of Buenos Aires, which determined she had a "complex abdominal condition." On 6 February, she underwent an upper digestive endoscopy and suffered a cardiac arrest that caused her death. The journalist's family went to court and presented a complaint to dispute the claims of the sanatorium and on 7 February Judge Gabriel Ghirlanda determined Pérez Volpin's was a "wrongful homicide". After conducting an autopsy in the judicial morgue her remains were veiled in the Buenos Aires legislature on 8 February with public access between 2 and 10 pm, which was attended by four thousand people. She was buried next to her father, Aurelio Pérez Flores, in the Pantheon of the Asturians of the Chacarita Cemetery.
In April, after the resignation of Judge Gabriel Ghirlanda, the criminal case was left to his colleague Carlos Burniard. On 19 June 2018, endoscopist Diego Bioalolenkier and anesthesiologist Nélida Inés Puente were indicted, the only two individuals charged in the case. The Court also ordered the arrest of both professionals for the sum of 1.7 million pesos each.

Mayflower (Canadian ship)

The Mayflower was a Canadian flat-bottom steamer that sank on November 12, 1912. Built in Combermere, Ontario in 1903, the Mayflower was a wooden 77-foot-long ship and was powered by two steam engines that drove a single paddle wheel in her stern.
It was traveling from Barry's Bay to Combermere to deliver the body of John Brown to his brother-in-law (a local Combermere city councillor). On that night, it sank on Kamaniskeg Lake in a winter storm, losing nine lives. Three managed to survive by staying afloat by clinging onto the casket that carried John Brown. Eventually they reached a small island called Gull Island (now known as Parcher Island) and built a fire using the debris and wreckage that had washed ashore. It was reported worldwide at the time by Ripley's Believe it or Not.
This tragedy marked the worst inland maritime disaster in Canadian history at the time. As a result, an island is named after the ship on Kamaniskeg Lake to commemorate it.

The Break with Michelle Wolf

The Break with Michelle Wolf is an American streaming television variety show starring Michelle Wolf that premiered on May 27, 2018 on Netflix. The series is executive produced by Wolf, Dan Powell, Christine Nangle, and Daniel Bodansky. Powell and Nangle also act as showrunners for the series. On August 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had canceled the series.
Premise.
"The Break with Michelle Wolf" was designed to "take a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy" and "instead of making the news fun, she’ll make fun of everything and everybody. There will be no preaching or political agenda — unless it’s funny."
Production.
On February 12, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given the production a series order consisting of ten episodes and expected the show to begin airing sometime in late 2018. The series was set to star Michelle Wolf who also executive produces alongside Dan Powell, Christine Nangle, and Daniel Bodansky. Powell and Nangle were also expected to act as showrunners for the series. Wolf's production company Cats in Pants was expected to produce the series as well.
Cancellation.
On April 11, 2018, it was announced that the show had been titled "The Break with Michelle Wolf" and that it would premiere on May 27, 2018. On August 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had declined to renew the series, reportedly due to low viewership, effectively canceling it.
Release.
On April 28, 2018, the first trailer for the series was released following Wolf's hosting stint at the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner. On May 18, 2018, a second trailer was released. About a week later, a clip from the first episode was released.
Reception.
The series was met with a positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 77% approval rating with an average rating of 8 out of 10 based on 13 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Break With Michelle Wolf" has room for improvement, but this late-night show is a welcome break from the norm."
Early critical reviews of the series premiere were largely positive. In a positive review, "The Globe and Mail"s John Doyle offered the series commendation saying, "This is more laid-back, low-key, absurdist feminist humour. It's wickedly entertaining, coming out of left field into a very crowded arena." In another favorable assessment, "The Guardian"s Charles Bramesco said, "Wolf's pilot episode prophesies a brief period of growing pains in pursuit of an individual identity, and grand dividends once it's complete." In an additional approving analysis, "Variety"s Caroline Framke said, "Whether she’s tearing down a politician, scoffing at a sexist institution, or telling her audience it deserves a break (pun intended) before speeding away on a tricycle, Wolf is always grinning with delight that she gets to do it all on her own weird terms. Not every joke has to land for the show to be even half as much fun as Wolf is clearly having." In a more negative critique, Ken Tucker of "Yahoo! TV" was less enthusiastic about the series' premiere episode saying, "It wasn't a very auspicious debut; Wolf's standup comedy was OK but not hilarious, and her taped segments demonstrated a tendency to repeat the same joke over and over."
Summarizing his opinion of the series as a whole, Darren Franich of "Entertainment Weekly" published a review of the series before the premiere of its season finale where he gave it a grade of "B+" and praised it saying, "Jokes won’t fix everything. But whoever said comedy had to do anything? At its best, Wolf’s show has been an earnest plea to keep laughing. It’s a break from bleak times, like how a breath of fresh air is a nice break from drowning."

Audio interface

An audio interface is a piece of computer hardware that allows the input and output of audio signals to and from a host computer or recording device.
Audio interfaces are closely related to computer sound cards, but whereas sound cards are optimised for audio playback an audio interface is primarily intended to provide low-latency analog-to-digital and digital format conversion for professional audio applications. Furthermore audio interfaces are typically available as external units, often in a 19-inch rackmount format.
History.
Standalone audio interfaces grew from the proprietary hard disk recording market of the 1980s and 1990s, but advances in processor power and hard drive speed meant that, by the mid-1990s, standard home computers were capable of recording multi-channel audio at 16-bit, 44khz compact disc standard.
Early systems such as Digidesign's Sound Tools (1989) and Session 8 (1993) and the Ensoniq PARIS (1998) consisted of an external unit that connected to the host computer with a ISA or SCSI card, but from the late 1990s onwards it became practical to use standard computer interfaces such as FireWire, USB, and eventually Thunderbolt instead. One notable exception was Digidesign/Avid's Pro Tools, which continued to use a mixed internal/external hardware solution until 2010.
Versus mixers.
Although there is a degree of functional overlap, audio interfaces are differentiated from audio mixers in that they are intended to pass multi-channel audio directly to a host digital audio workstation, whereas mixers generally sum their inputs into a simple two-channel stereo pair. Audio interfaces are therefore often simple rackmount boxes, without faders, although as of 2020 some digital mixers provide multi-channel audio passthrough.

Harristown State High School Buildings

Harristown State High School Buildings is a heritage-listed collection of state high school buildings at Harristown State High School at 341-367 South Street, Harristown, Toowoomba, Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1954, Block B. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016.
History.
Harristown State High School (SHS) opened on its present site in 1955, due to post-World War II (WWII) growth in the population of Toowoomba and its suburb of Harristown. As at 2016, Harristown SHS retains seven buildings initially constructed during 1954–61, some with later extensions. These include:
The school also retains its:
The school has been in continuous operation since establishment.
The establishment and growth of Harristown SHS is a direct result of the growth of Toowoomba, Queensland's largest inland city. European settlement of the Toowoomba area, traditional country of the Giabal and Jarowair people, commenced in 1840 when squatters occupied pastoral runs on the Darling Downs. At the junction of two routes to Gorman's and Hodgson's gaps through the Main Range, the small settlement of Drayton evolved from 1842 as a stopping place for pastoralists and travellers. Six kilometres to its north-east was an area known as "The Swamp" – renamed Toowoomba by 1859 – which was first surveyed in 1849 as 12 suburban allotments of Drayton. 
Toowoomba grew rapidly, due to its superior land and water supply, support from squatters and land speculators, and, from 1855, an easier route to Brisbane via the Toll Bar Road. Toowoomba was declared a municipality (the Borough of Toowoomba) in July 1860, and by the 1861 census it was clear that Toowoomba had eclipsed Drayton. The Main Line railway arrived in 1867 (connecting to Brisbane in 1876), and Toowoomba's economy diversified to include numerous small-scale manufacturing outlets, while the majority of administrative, service and other government and education functions for the surrounding region were centred on the town. Toowoomba was also popular as a summer retreat for the colony's elite. It was declared the City of Toowoomba in 1904.
Toowoomba was an early centre for education, with the first National School (later known as Toowoomba South State School) opening in 1865. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales, were continued in Queensland following the colony's separation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.
To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.
The first school in Harristown was a state school, located about southwest of the centre of Toowoomba, opened in 1911, south of South Street (just southeast of the later SHS site). At this time Toowoomba's population was 10,636. Harristown had been established when subdivisions from the Harristown Estate were sold from 1902. Overcrowding at Harristown State School soon led to the opening of an open air annex building at the school in 1915, and the school was increased to five acres in size in 1919.
Harristown State School's enrolment continued to rise after WWII, increasing from 237 in 1947, when the school was already overcrowded, to 630 in 1960. This reflected Toowoomba's post-war population, which rose by 30% between 1947 and 1957, from 35,194 to 45,900. Toowoomba's municipal boundaries expanded; suburbs developed, and amenities and services increased. Growth in its primary and secondary industries also increased, construction projects provided a boom for the local building industry, and tourist numbers grew. Improvements to the Toowoomba central business district (CBD), delayed by WWII, began in earnest in the 1950s.
The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the "baby boom". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.
In 1953, the Acting Head Teacher at Harristown State School reported to the Department of Public Instruction (renamed the Department of Education in 1957) that there was considerable building activity in the Harristown area; that more families were moving into the "Stephen St Hut area", as previous families moved out; and that "the greater part of the Harristown population consists of young families".
The Stephen Street Hut area was a former military camp. During WWII, two Australian defence facilities, 3 Advanced Ordnance Depot (AOD) and 6 Advanced Workshop (AEME), were established just east of the Gore Highway, to the northwest of the later site of Harristown SHS. The camp for 3 AOD (west of the Gore Highway) was occupied by squatters by 1947, while the Workshop camp's buildings (north of Stephens Street, northeast of the school site) were leased to the Queensland Housing Commission from about 1949 to 1954.
Post-war population growth, including the construction of Housing Commission homes in Harristown, not only impacted on the Harristown State School, but also led to a state high school being established opposite, to the north of South Street.
In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering this to be of little relevance to Queensland's economy which was based on the primary industries. The Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided scholarships for high-achieving students to attend elite grammar schools, although few were awarded. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". High tops were an economical measure that provided essentially the same education while utilising already established facilities. In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after WWII when secondary education was generally accepted as essential and was more widely provided for.
In the 1950s the number of high schools in Queensland increased significantly. In 1954 it was reported that high school enrolments had almost doubled since 1948, from 4500 to nearly 11,000. About 50 sites had been acquired, most with an area of , and by 1954 there were 30 state high schools.
Toowoomba State High School (est. 1919) was no longer sufficient for the city's secondary student population. In late 1954 Queensland's Education Minister, George Devries, noted that state high schools would open at Innisfail, Harristown, and Southport in 1955, as the "pressure of enrolments had made the establishment of high schools necessary at these three centres". At Toowoomba, "the technical and high school was now so large that it was necessary to establish a separate high school".
Reflecting the growth of suburbanisation and a move towards a decentralised population in urban centres, new high schools were located in suburban areas rather than the centre of town. The grounds were large, providing ample room for sports facilities. The general classroom buildings were the same standard types as used for primary schools but high schools also included purpose-built science laboratories, domestic science buildings, workshops for woodwork and metal work, libraries, and gymnasiums. These were also built to standard plans but were specific to their use and not a continuation of previous designs.
Additionally, there was a focus on the fit between the school and its neighbourhood, as well as site planning for expansion and ideal solar orientation. In the early 1950s, architects developed master planning concepts that influenced the design and layout of the whole school. Initially, these plans were broadly based on regular and symmetrical plan forms around a central or prominent axis. This concept was replaced a few years later by architects planning for growth and change. There was a shift away from grid-like layouts to organic layouts. Nuclear plans were designed, centred on a reception building with classroom wings connected to and fanning away from the nucleus. The primary focus was the ideal solar orientation of buildings. Interest was also shown in developing schemes that related to the natural contours and existing vegetation. Unlike the more formal and symmetrical plans of previous periods, new plans were developed that tended to be asymmetrical and more open. The long, narrow buildings were positioned so that the spaces captured between them were triangular, opening out into the landscape. The layout of Harristown SHS appears to have been organic in form, from the beginning.
The Harristown SHS site was reserved , and included of land east of Hennessy Street, between South Street in the South, and Stephens Street in the north. This school reserve, Portion 907 (R1014), absorbed a surveyed road (Rivett Street). A neighbouring to the west was purchased by the Secretary for Public Instruction in 1950, forming the current grounds. Just west of the SHS site was "Redlands", a brick residence built in 1889 on for Edmund Wilcox. This land had been dedicated as Concordia Lutheran College, a co-educational Lutheran Boarding School, in 1946.
The construction of Harristown SHS was approved in September 1954, at a cost of , and the first building (called Block B in 2016) was ready for the start of the 1955 school year. Although a July 1954 site plan of the school shows an administration block to the west of four school buildings (three of them grouped around an assembly area), a curved access driveway from South Street, a sports oval, and four tennis courts, in May 1955 Block B was still the only building on the bare school grounds, and the oval was not yet formed. The 1954 site plan also shows an "existing flagpole", just north of where Block B would be built.
From 1950 the Department of Public Instruction introduced and developed new standard plans for school buildings. These buildings were high-set timber-framed structures and the understorey was used as covered play space. Introduced in 1950, the principal type (F/T4) was a long and narrow building with a gable roof. A semi-enclosed stair connected the understorey to a north facing verandah running the length of the building. Classrooms opened off the verandah and had extensive areas of windows; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed, allowing abundant natural light and ventilation. This type was the most commonly constructed in the 1950s in Queensland.
In 1954 the type was improved by replacing the proliferation of stumps in the understorey with a timber truss that spanned the width of the classroom and provided an unimpeded play space. This concept was further refined in 1957 by replacing the timber truss with a steel open-web joist that spanned further and removed more understorey stumps. This structural system was employed with reinforced concrete piers to support large loads at minimal costs. This was further refined in 1959 by replacing the concrete piers and open-web joist with a steel portal frame that was employed extensively in the 1960s and 1970s.
Block B was a timber school building with timber floor trusses. This type, built from 1954–60, was highset with either classrooms, and often had clerestory windows above the verandah wall. Their timber-framed floor trusses provided play space underneath the building.
Block B initially included (from the east end, ground floor) a science lecture room; a store and science store; a science laboratory; an open student recreation area; a cleaner's room, switch room, and girls lavatory; and a boys locker room, boys lavatory, and a staff lavatory. On the upper floor (from the east) was a commercial room , together with four classrooms with folding partitions between them. Two temporary staff rooms with temporary partitions occupied a fifth classroom space, and at the west end of the building there was a temporary principal's office and waiting space, occupying a future cloak room, . An verandah ran along the northern side of the building, with enclosed hat and bag racks, and stairs at each end; the west end stairs were enclosed with brick and glass, while the stairs at the east end were temporary. There were centre-pivoting clerestory windows between the northern verandah roof and the eaves; and probably louvre windows in the verandah wall. The southern windows were either centre-pivoting or awning (top-hung) windows.
Harristown SHS soon included manual training and domestic science wings. Vocational education was a Queensland Government priority to support the development of primary industries; and after World War I this led to the establishment of a variety of subjects. Vocational training within primary education began in 1895 with drawing classes and expanded to include domestic sciences, agriculture, and sheet metal and wood working classes. The subjects required a variety of purpose-built facilities and were initially gender segregated. Standard, purpose-designed vocational buildings were first introduced in 1928. In 1936 the Minister for Education permitted students to take vocational subjects in lieu of geography or history in the Junior Examination, increasing the subjects' popularity.
Two timber vocational buildings were constructed at Harristown SHS in 1955. This type, built 1954–55, was usually highset on timber or concrete stumps, with a verandah, and was externally clad in chamferboards. Both buildings were located to the east of Block B, almost at right angles to the earlier building.
The first to be constructed was the manual training block (Block L in 2016), northeast of Block B. Block L was highset on ground sloping down to the north, with brick walls to the east and south sides of the undercroft. Large banks of centre-pivoting and awning windows on the east side were sheltered under strutted eaves. There was a store and staff room in an section at the south end; then a sheet metal room and a woodwork room . There was a wide verandah on the west side, and awning windows on the east side. Bike racks and a timber store were located under the west side of the building.
The domestic science block (Block K in 2016), was lowset on sloping ground, with brick walls to the east and north sides of the undercroft. Located southeast of Block B, it had a lecture room at the north end, a cookery room , small dining, fitting and staff rooms in a bay and a dressmaking room at the south end. Blocks K and L were joined to the east end of Block B by a covered and paved area, with a flower box at the northeast corner of Block K. Around this time the present steps down from the first floor of the east end of Block B were added, enclosed in brick and glass with a flower box to the north. There was a verandah along the west side of Block K, to which awning windows (not extant in 2016) were added , between the verandah posts.
Harristown's new administration block was a result of growth at the school, "where an administrative unit of this pleasing character [had] become necessary". The administration block (the northern section of Block Z in 2016) was added to the west of Block B -8. Connected to the northwest corner of the ground floor of Block B by a covered way, it included concrete paved indoor-outdoor areas; a raised concrete dais and a garden plot to the northeast; male and female toilets at the east end of the building; two staff rooms to the west; offices for the Principal and Deputy Principal at the west end of the building; and two brick flower boxes and a raised area of concrete pavers outside the northwest entrance. The building was sheeted with metal, with stone feature walls at the southwest corner and a brick wall at the east end, and had clerestory windows on the south side. The use of stone was a deliberate move to improve the aesthetics of the school. In 1959 it was noted that, as high schools grew, they needed "elements of maturity", the aim being "to develop pride in the school and to supplement academic education with desirable aesthetic experience".
The school continued to grow, requiring additions in the late 1950s. A new classroom was added to the north end of the manual training timber vocational building, Block L, in 1957; along with bike racks underneath. Stairs at the north end of the verandah descended in front of the temporary masonite sheeted wall used at the north end of the block. Although floor plans at this time showed two additional rooms, the second (northernmost) room was not built until 1959.
A new classroom wing (Block C in 2016) was also constructed c.1959-60, set at an angle to, and north of, Block B and an assembly area. Block C was a timber school building with open web steel floor trusses. This type, built 1957-60, was highset and timber-framed, with classrooms either square or . Like the timber floor trusses on earlier buildings, the open web steel floor trusses provided unimpeded space at ground level. Timber awning windows were used extensively on southern walls, with louvres to the verandah wall (at Harristown, double-hung sash windows were used in the verandah wall instead). External cladding was chamferboards.
When completed, the ground floor of Block C included: a store under the stairs (which were enclosed with brick and wired glass, with a flower box to the north) at the eastern end of the building; girls toilet and locker room; store and staff toilet; covered recreation and assembly area; and a dais (raised area) at the west end. There was also seating set around the perimeter of the open areas. The upper floor, from the east, included: a physics lab , cloakroom and store, a physics lecture room square; then five square classrooms. A verandah ran along most of the north side, excluding the east end. The upper floor was supported on open web steel trusses and lozenge-shaped reinforced concrete columns; and brick walls were used at the ends of the building, for parts of the ground floor, and for enclosing the stairs; with metal cladding elsewhere. There were awning windows on the south side, double-hung sash windows to the northern verandah, and clerestory windows above the verandah roof. Block C appears to have been built in two stages: the western four classrooms first, with the remainder added .
The manual training timber vocational building, Block L, was also extended to the north in 1959, with a new square classroom; and concrete steps and a flower box (latter not extant 2016) were added at the north end of the verandah. In the same year a new section of covered walkway was constructed between the administration block and the west end of Block C, with the addition of a health services room at the west end of the upper floor of Block C, west of the stairs; and an Oslo lunch canteen to the south of, and separate from, the southwest corner of the ground floor of Block C. The lunch canteen was initially built with three half-height brick walls (being open to the north) with fixed wired glass windows over (to the west, south and east) and the north side has since been enclosed.
Oslo canteens offered healthy lunches, based on the Norwegian nutritious lunch movement. A trial of the "Oslo lunch" in a Victorian school in 1940 found that the lunch, which included a salad sandwich on wholemeal bread, a bottle of milk and a piece of fruit, helped children gain weight, increased their energy, and assisted the healing of minor wounds. The program soon spread around Australia.
In 1961 the complex of school buildings was extended further north with the addition of another timber school building with open web steel floor trusses (Block D in 2016), north of, and connected by a covered walkway to, Block C. Block D had two floors, with brick end walls and metal wall cladding. The ground floor included open space around a tuckshop; with a library and library work room to the east; and toilets, cleaners rooms and stairwells at each end. The first floor had four classrooms in the middle, with store rooms, staff rooms, locker rooms and stairwells at each end.  By 1961 the oval had been formed west of the school buildings, and basketball courts constructed south of the oval.
Harristown SHS needed more room in the 1960s, especially since Grade 8 students were transferred to Queensland high schools for the 1964 school year. A number of new buildings and additions were thus constructed in 1963. An additional classroom block (Block A in 2016) was constructed south of Block B; a new manual training block (Block M in 2016) was added north of Block L; and the domestic science timber vocational building, Block K, was extended to the south - two new dressmaking rooms were added, and the existing southern (dressmaking) classroom was reconfigured with new partitions, to incorporate the north end of a new classroom and a new fitting room, store and staffroom. The existing cookery room was extended to the south, and a laundry was created on the site of the old dining room. A new covered way linked Block K to Block A.
A two-storey science block (Block H in 2016) followed , to the west of Blocks C and D, although it was not present in a July 1965 aerial photograph. The latter showed the school had seven blocks (Blocks A, B, C, D, K, L and M) by mid-1965, plus the administration block. Five rows of long, narrow structures, north of a vehicle entrance from Hennessy Street to the north of Block M, were probably bicycle sheds.
The school grounds had also been developed by 1965. The oval had tennis courts to the north (extant 2016) and basketball courts (not extant in 2016) to the south. There were also gardens and/or paths between Hennessy Street and the link between Blocks K and L. There was a pedestrian gate to Hennessy Street in this vicinity, marked on a 1972 plan, and two brick piers survive in 2016. Just north of the brick piers, there is another pedestrian gateway in 2016, with a metal archway reading "Harristown State High School", mounted on  concrete plinths.
The school grounds also included shade trees. By 1965 there were trees planted either side of the curved driveway from South Street; along South Street east of the driveway; south of Block A; in a line heading southeast from the south end of K Block; and north along Hennessy Street from South Street. Trees were also planted along the street frontage west of the South Street entrance driveway by 1971.
Harristown SHS continued to expand from the late 1960s, with a new classroom block (the west end of Block E in 2016) built in 1966, and extended to the east in 1969. An assembly hall (Block G in 2016) was also built . A library (Block J in 2016) was constructed, south of Block A, in 1970-1.
By 1971, when the population of Toowoomba was 59,524, the ground floor of Block B included two classrooms in the former open student recreation area. The western central staff room of the administration block was divided into a typist room and store area. Block C's ground floor covered recreation area and assembly area was enclosed for a TV room at the west end, a projection room, then a "temporary only" girls locker room at the east end; while the western dais was 'temporary only' boys lockers.
The domestic science timber vocational building, Block K, was extended in 1972, again to south, with a new dressmaking room, plus two fitting rooms and a storeroom. The northern dressmaking room in the 1963 extension was converted into a cookery room, and a new partition was added to form a dining room south of the cookery room in the 1955 section of block. A toilet block (Block F in 2016) was constructed north of Block E between 1972 and 1974, and the school's three northern sports fields and embankments were also formed . A music centre (Block N in 2016) was constructed southwest of the administration block ;  and the administration block was extended to the south , with changes to its original room configuration occurring at this time.
Although more buildings have since been added to the school, the complex of 1954-61 buildings with later extensions remains at the core of the school. In 2016, Harristown SHS continues to operate from its original site on South Street. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. With over 1500 students, it is the largest secondary school on the Darling Downs.
As Harristown State High School is located inland, architects at Towill Design Group and builders at FKG Group and Honeywill Consulting understood that enabling cross-flow ventilation was a crucial component of the brief. This building presents itself as a keystone for the campus' front of house facilities, ideal for its corner setting providing connection and street presence for the school. This was a major factor in why louvre windows were specified throughout the building. With extra large spans, louvres allowed for 83.4% free flow air. The inclusion of these hybrid louvres also matched with the school's contemporary design and its surrounding landscaping.
Description.
Harristown State High School occupies an rectangular site that is located in the suburb of Harristown, on the western edge of Toowoomba. The site slopes gently down towards the north, and is accessed by a slightly curved driveway leading from South Street at the southern end of the site. The site is also accessed by Hennessy Street (east) and is bounded by Stephen Street (north) and Concordia Lutheran College (west). The school retains a complex of seven buildings (1954-1961, some with later extensions) linked by covered walkways, with courtyard assembly and play spaces between the buildings, located in the southeastern corner of the site. The landscaped grounds are well established, and include mature trees, and playing fields at the western and northern ends of the site. 
The seven significant buildings within the school complex are:
Evidence of early site planning of the school grounds remains and is typical of Queensland schools during the 1950s, with splayed, long and narrow buildings linked around courtyard play spaces and centralised around a nucleus. Blocks B, C, D and the administration block are arranged in a staggered, approximately parallel and axially east-west formation, and Blocks K and L are approximately perpendicular to Block B on a north-south axis. The covered links between the administration block and the west ends of Blocks B and C, and between the east end of Block B and Blocks K and L, are also evidence of early site planning.
With the exception of the administration block and Oslo lunch canteen, the blocks are long, timber and brick buildings with profiled metal-clad gable roofs. Most external walls are clad in timber chamferboards, with some featuring face brick end walls, and face brick and glazed stair enclosures. Most soffits are lined in flat sheeting with rounded cover strips, and all bag racks are timber-framed with profiled metal exterior cladding. All metal-framed windows are modern and are not of cultural heritage significance.
Administration block.
The administration block is a lowset, single-story, timber-framed and masonry structure that is sheltered by a low-pitch gable roof clad in profiled metal sheeting. The building consists of two wings: the original, 1957-8 wing to the north; and a later, -6 wing to the south (the southern wing is not of cultural heritage significance). The exterior of the northern wing is generally clad in metal sheets, with stone walls featured in the southwestern corner and a facebrick feature wall forming the eastern elevation. Original angled concrete steps, concrete pavers and two face brick flower-boxes have been retained in the northwestern corner of the building, and a concrete garden plot survives east of the building, south of a raised concrete slab.
The original open-plan internal layout of the northern wing is discernible, although lightweight partitions now enclose some of the former circulation and waiting areas. The wing is accessed via two internal corridors: one that runs along the southern edge of the wing, and another, separated by an exposed stone wall, that runs north-south at the western end of the building. The southern corridor has been extended to the west through an opening cut in the stone wall. Opening off the southern corridor are eastern toilets and a cleaner's room, a central (eastern) sick bay, a central (western) office space and a western printing room. Two office spaces are located west of, and modern walls enclose an office to the east of, the western corridor. Interior walls and ceilings are lined in flat sheeting and plaster, with the exception of the exposed stone walls. Modern carpet and linoleum lining the floors and modern cabinetry are not of cultural heritage significance.
Windows retained in the building include timber-framed awnings and louvres. All doors are modern replacements; with the southern location of the door to the southern toilet moved to the west (the original location is identifiable through retained framing).
Timber school building (Block B).
The timber school building with timber floor trusses (Block B) is a two-storey building that has north-facing verandahs and a timber floor truss system supporting the first floor. Western and eastern timber stairs provide access to the first-floor verandah. The chamferboards are vented at the apex of the gable-end walls and face brick walls enclose the ground floor western amenities (now rendered on the northern face) and ground-floor portion of the western stair. The southern eaves are supported by timber brackets. The stairs are enclosed in large, timber-framed screens of fixed and wired glazing - the eastern stair has been relocated from its original position, and has a brick flower box to its north.
The verandah has a low-pitched roof that is set below clerestory windows and is supported by continuous (ground to ceiling) timber posts. The ground floor verandah has a concrete slab floor and a flat, profiled metal ceiling; while the first floor verandah has a timber floor and a ceiling lined in flat sheeting with rounded cover strips and raked at a low angle. Bag racks form the northern balustrade, with timber three-rail balustrades located adjacent to the stairs.
The interior of the first floor is divided into six classrooms with a narrow office at the western end. The ground floor comprises western amenities, eastern classrooms with dividing store rooms, and central classrooms (enclosing a former open recreation area). The walls and ceilings of most classrooms are lined in flat sheeting with rounded cover strips, and timber portal trusses are visible within the ground floor spaces. Modern carpet, tile and linoleum floor linings are not of cultural heritage significance.
Timber joinery has been retained throughout the building, including banks of timber-framed, top-hung awning windows with centre-pivoting fanlights to the south; half-glazed and panelled timber doors within classrooms, and V-jointed (VJ) timber board-lined interior doors within the bathrooms. Most northern windows remain in the same location, but are modern replacements and most louvres on the ground floor north wall have been replaced with fixed lights (marks within the timber frame indicate the original fixed-louvre configuration). All verandah doors and most verandah windows are modern replacements and door openings between the central classrooms on the first floor have been enclosed with flat sheeting (timber framing indicates their former locations). An early laboratory teaching desk is retained in the easternmost ground floor classroom, and early metal pendant lights are located in the easternmost first floor classroom. Some classrooms also retain cupboards with sloping whiteboards above.
Timber school building (Block C).
The timber school building with open web steel floor trusses (Block C) features face brick and profiled metal-clad end walls, and an open web steel floor truss system supported on lozenge-shaped, concrete columns. The ground floor spaces and stairs at the eastern and western ends are enclosed by face brick walls and the southern eaves are supported by timber brackets. There is a concrete garden box north of the eastern stairs. The building's verandahs face northwest, and the masonry addition that connects to the western end of the first-floor verandah is not of cultural heritage significance.
The verandah has a low-pitched roof set below clerestory windows; with the ground floor verandah featuring a concrete slab floor rising in height at the western end, a profiled metal-clad ceiling, and exposed cantilevered trusses. The first-floor verandah has circular metal posts, flat sheet-lined ceilings and bag racks that form the balustrade.
The first floor contains six classrooms separated from a larger eastern classroom by a narrow store. The ground floor interior comprises eastern amenities, and a former recreation area to the west that is now enclosed to form a large storage and office space and a classroom. The floor-level of the storage and office space is set above the remainder of the floor, and the easternmost toilets have been converted to locker enclosures, with timber framing retained and indicating their original location. Most walls on the first floor are lined above dado level in flat sheets with rounded cover strips, below dado level in flat sheeting, and the ceilings are of plaster. The ground floor walls are generally face and painted brick or are lined in flat sheeting. Trusses are exposed in most ground level rooms, although some have been boxed in with plasterboard. The former Physics laboratory retains a timber-framed rolling blackboard.
Windows to the south and east are generally banks of timber-framed awning windows, with the southern windows including centre-pivoting fanlights, and those to the north are timber-framed double-hung sashes. The clerestory windows are timber-framed with centre-pivoting sashes, and windows to the amenities are timber-framed louvres. Timber half-glazed and panelled doors connecting the five westernmost classrooms and the two easternmost classrooms and store are retained. All doors to the verandah are modern replacements.
Oslo lunch canteen.
The Oslo lunch canteen stands to the south of the west end of Block C. It is a small, rectangular building with southern, eastern and western walls of face brick below sill height and fixed, wired glazing above. The northern wall, including windows and doors, is an addition and is not of cultural heritage significance. All double-hung sashes and metal window grates are also modern.
The interior comprises a single room, with a ceiling lined in flat sheets with rounded cover-strips, and painted brick walls. The carpet floor lining is modern. 
Former domestic science building (Block K).
The former domestic science timber vocational building (Block K) is a lowset, single-storey, timber-framed building with a western verandah. Its northern end-wall is clad in vertical timber weatherboards, the southern end-wall is facebrick, and the eastern eaves are supported by timber struts. The building is accessed via small timber and concrete stairs to the west and north and a modern concrete ramp to the southwest. There is a brick flower box on the northeast corner of the building.
The verandah has a raked ceiling lined in flat sheets with rounded cover strips, square timber posts and bag racks that form the balustrade. The floor is timber, with the exception of the southern end, which is of coloured concrete.
The interior comprises a northern classroom (formerly two): separated from a large, central domestic science (home economics, some dividing walls removed) room by a western store (with a small eastern extension); and two southern classrooms separated by three store rooms (two of which were formerly fitting rooms). The walls and ceilings of the northern classroom and domestic science room are plastered, while those in the southern classrooms are lined in flat sheeting. Some classrooms retain cupboards under sloping whiteboards. The southern wall of the southernmost classroom is face brick. Carpets and linoleum floor linings are modern and not of cultural heritage significance.
The eastern wall has a large, continuous bank of timber-framed awning windows with centre-pivoting fanlights; and the western wall contains timber-framed double-hung sashes with centre-pivoting fanlights. Doors throughout the building are modern replacements, with some verandah doors boarded over with flat sheeting.
Former manual training building (Block L).
The former manual training timber vocational building (Block L) is a highset, single-storey, timber-framed building that is set on concrete stumps, and has a western verandah. The southern wall is face brick and extends beyond the building and out to the east; and the eastern eaves are supported by timber struts. The understorey is used as storage space and is enclosed with rendered masonry walls and timber battening. Access to the building is via southern timber stairs, northwestern concrete stairs and a modern ramp at the southern end of the building (the ramp is not of cultural heritage significance).
The verandah has a timber floor, timber posts, balustrades formed by bag racks and a raked ceiling clad in flat sheeting. The northern end is enclosed in wired, fixed glazing.
The interior comprises four classrooms, with two store rooms connected to the southern side of the southern classroom. Doors connect the two southernmost and the two northernmost classrooms. All interior walls are lined in flat sheeting (the two southernmost classrooms have rounded cover strips). The ceilings of the two northern classrooms are of plaster and those in the southern classrooms are lined in flat sheeting with rounded cover strips. Most classrooms retain timber-framed rolling blackboards, or cupboards under sloping whiteboards.
The eastern wall has a large, continuous bank of timber-framed awning windows with centre-pivoting fanlights; and the western wall contains timber-framed double-hung sashes with centre-pivoting fanlights. The three northernmost classrooms retain early timber half glazed and panelled doors, with interior doors in a similar style also retained between classrooms. Panelled, high-waisted timber doors are also retained. Modern doors to the southern ends of the southernmost classrooms are recent replacements and are not significant.
Timber school building (Block D).
The timber school building with Metal Open Web Floor Trusses (Block D) is a long, two storey building with cantilevered metal open web floor trusses supported on rectangular concrete columns and a northern verandah. The eastern and western end walls and some ground floor enclosures are facebrick, with the remainder of the building's exterior clad in flat sheets and profiled metal. Concrete stairs, located at the eastern and western ends of the building, provide access to the first-floor verandah and classrooms and have metal handrails.
The first floor verandah has a timber floor, square timber posts and bag racks that form a balustrade; while the ground floor verandah has a concrete slab floor, profiled metal ceiling, circular metal posts and bag racks. The first-floor verandah walls are of recent flat sheeting.
The first floor contains three (formerly four; wall removed) central classrooms, with store and staff rooms to the east and west. Walls have been added to the central classroom to form a storeroom; and a wall has been added to one of the eastern storerooms to form two spaces. The ground floor comprises a central storeroom, classroom and tuckshop, with eastern and western toilets, and storerooms located south of the stairwells. A brick wall has been removed from the classroom space, and a modern partition has been added at the eastern end to form an additional store room. A recent wall also extends the tuckshop to the north. Interior walls are generally line with flat sheets with rounded cover strips and plaster. Facebrick walls are exposed in the stairwells and amenities. Floor trusses have been boxed over with plasterboard in some ground floor spaces.
The first floor retains some early panelled and half-glazed timber doors to the verandah, although most interior door openings have been boarded over or are modern replacements. Some timber-framed louvres and awnings have been retained in the southern elevation; although all fanlights and verandah windows are modern replacements.
Landscape elements.
The school grounds are well established, with sporting facilities including a large oval, which is marked by a curved post and rail timber fence, west of the main school building complex; four early tennis courts to the north of the oval; and three playing fields at the north end of the school grounds.
The splayed open courtyard spaces between blocks B and C, and C and D, which were formed as part of the 1950s and early 1960s planning, are sealed in bitumen and are used as open play-space. Metal-framed shade structures with profiled metal roof cladding and concrete slab floors form covered connections between the significant school buildings.
A curved entrance driveway, running approximately northeast from the South Street school entrance to the administration block, is lined on either side by an avenue of established trees. Other mature trees, planted during the school's first 15 years of operation, are located along South Street; in an east-west line south of Block J; and in a line extending southeast from the end of Block K.
A decorative metal archway set on concrete plinths is located at the Hennessey Street entrance and features "HARRISTOWN STATE HIGH SCHOOL" in metal lettering. To the south of the archway are two brick piers at an older entrance.
Heritage listing.
Harristown State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Harristown State High School (established in 1955) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities.
The layout of the administration and classroom blocks, the covered links between them and associated open spaces, reflect the early 1950s introduction of master planning, which provided for ordered growth from a nucleus.
The timber school building with timber floor trusses (1954) and the two timber school buildings with open web steel floor trusses (1959–60, and 1961) represent the evolution of Department of Public Works designs during the mid to late 1950s to allow for unimpeded play space under highset timber school buildings.
The former domestic science and manual training timber vocational buildings (both 1955) reflect the Queensland Government's focus on vocational training as a way of ensuring the state's economic prosperity.
The northern section of the administration block (1957–58) represents a move away from the austerity of the early 1950s to a more permanent aesthetic, incorporating masonry elements.
The Oslo lunch canteen (1959) is important surviving evidence of the spread of a Norwegian "healthy lunch" movement through Queensland's schools in the post-World War II (WWII) era.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Harristown State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state high school of the 1950s. These include its 1950s site planning; range of highset and lowset timber-framed teaching buildings of standard and individual designs that incorporated understorey play areas, verandahs, and classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation; and a generous, landscaped site with mature shade trees and assembly and sports areas.
Following 1950s site planning principles, the school includes five classroom blocks that all contribute to the general concept of splayed, long, narrow buildings linked around open ended courtyard assembly and play spaces, fanning out from the administration block.
The ground level administration block, the covered links between it and Blocks B and C, and between Blocks B, K and L, and the courtyard spaces between the buildings, are characteristic of 1950s school design in Queensland.
The timber school building with timber floor trusses and the 1959-60 timber school building with open web steel floor trusses are both good, intact examples of their type and demonstrate two iterations of the Department of Public Work's standard designs: incorporating timber floor trusses for unimpeded play space under the classrooms, and later using steel trusses to achieve the same effect. Both buildings retain their: highset character with visible trusses under; large banks of south-facing timber-framed awning windows, with centre-pivoting fanlights; clerestory lighting above the northern verandah roof; and wide classrooms.
The former domestic science and manual training timber vocational buildings both retain their timber-framed construction, set on stumps, with verandahs.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.
Harristown State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Harristown community. It was established in 1955 and generations of Harristown students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Harristown and as a focus for the community.

2017 Mexican protests

The 2017 Mexican protests were a series of protests against a hike in the price of gasoline by the Mexican government which came into effect on 1 January 2017. Thousands of protestors marched, blocked highways and shut down state-owned gas stations. The rise in price—known in Mexico as the —was a result of president Enrique Peña Nieto's privatization of the Mexican oil industry. Other factors that led to the protests include high inflation, a weak peso, widespread violence due to the Mexican Drug War, and Peña Nieto's low approval rating and corruption allegations.
Background.
On 26 December 2016, the Mexican government announced that gasoline prices would rise by up to 20% in January as result of the transition towards eliminating price controls. Beginning with the Mexican oil expropriation in 1938, the government controlled the country's entire petroleum industry, including both production and retail sales. The state-owned company, Pemex, held a monopoly on all gasoline sales in the country, and prices were set by the government. In 2013, the newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto began the process of privatizing Mexico's oil industry, which would eventually allow private companies to establish their own gas stations.
The Mexican government planned to transition to market prices gradually throughout 2017. Finance Minister José Antonio Meade explained that the price hike was "an important change," which would "allow prices to reflect costs, and avoid artificial distortions." The rise in gasoline prices was also a result of the government ending subsidies to the oil industry and may have been motivated by projected budget deficits because of the Mexican peso's weakening value relative to the US dollar.
The price hike, scheduled to begin on 1 January 2017, coincided with an economy marked by high inflation in addition to the weak peso. Donald Trump's recent election as president of the United States led to uncertainty, as he had campaigned on strong economic protectionism. Furthermore, Peña Nieto was experiencing historically-low approval ratings and was involved in numerous scandals.
Tensions in Mexico were also raised by the high homicide rates associated with the continued Mexican Drug War, which had begun over ten years earlier.
Protests.
Protests began on 1 January, the same day the new prices took effect. Activists used social media to organize protests and shut down gas stations throughout the country. Protestors also blockaded major highways and border crossings. Their demands included cheaper gasoline prices as well as the resignation of president Peña Nieto.
Protests and riots took place all over the country. Demonstrations in Tijuana and Nogales forced authorities to temporarily close Mexico–United States border crossings. In Rosarito, a man intentionally drove his vehicle into federal police officers. Looting was reported in Veracruz. In Tabasco, a convenience store was ransacked and burned. Mexico City had two large demonstrations in early January, with thousands of protestors in attendance.
Over 250 stores were looted during the protests. At least one police officer was killed while trying to prevent looting. At least four deaths have been attributed to the protests, as well as 1,500 arrests.

Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge

The Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge was a Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket match that took place in England on 31 May 2018. The West Indies cricket team played against a World XI team, to raise funds for stadiums damaged by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The damaged stadiums were Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla and Dominica's Windsor Park.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) granted the fixture international status, with Lord's being selected as venue to host the match. In March 2018, the ICC named Eoin Morgan as the captain of the World XI side. The following month, Carlos Brathwaite was named as the captain of the West Indies team. However, two days before the match, Morgan was ruled out of the fixture with a fractured finger, and replaced as captain by Shahid Afridi.
The West Indies won the one-off match by 72 runs.
Squads.
Shakib Al Hasan was originally named in the World XI team, but withdrew for personal reasons and was replaced with Sandeep Lamichhane. Hardik Pandya was ruled out of the match with a viral illness, and was replaced by Mohammed Shami.
Eoin Morgan fractured a finger two days before the game, so had to withdraw from the squad and was replaced by Sam Billings. Sam Curran was added to the squad at the same time, but the next day was called up by the England team for their Test against Pakistan, which started the day after the Lord's game.

Kuwait–Philippines relations

Kuwait–Philippines relations refers to the bilateral ties of Kuwait and the Philippines.
History.
Kuwait was recognized by the Philippines in September 1961, three months after it gained independence. Formal diplomatic relations would later be established between the two countries on January 17, 1979. The Philippines established an embassy in Kuwait in 1979.
The Philippines was part of the United States led coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi control during the Gulf War in 1991. Kuwait then open an embassy in Manila on May 24, 1996.
Economic relations.
Trade.
Trade between Kuwait and the Philippines amounted to $779 million in 2015 with the balance of trade favoring Kuwait. Kuwaiti investments in the Philippines are primarily agricultural in nature. In 1981, a bid by Philippine firms to build a $300 million highway to connect Kuwait to Baghdad, Iraq was highly publicized.
Labor.
Around 250 thousand Filipinos, 65 percent of which are domestic helpers, works in Kuwait according to the Philippine embassy in 2018. Domestic workers from the Philippines along with migrants from Sri Lanka and India began to settle in Kuwait in the 1970s. Reports of humans rights abuses against migrant workers in Kuwait including Filipinos remains a concern of the Philippines.
Alleged cases of abuse and rape has led to Filipinos making a petition to their government to ban the deployment of domestic help to Kuwait in 2013. The petition has collected at least 10 thousand signatures.
Controversies.
2018 diplomatic crisis.
President Rodrigo Duterte issued a ban on deployment of Filipino workers to Kuwait in February 2018 following a series of deaths of Filipino domestic workers. The incident that led to the ban reportedly was when the corpse of a Filipino domestic worker was discovered in a freezer inside a warehouse that had been abandoned since November 2016.
In April 2018, a video showed purported action by Philippine embassy officials rescuing Filipino maids from allegedly abusive employers. Kuwait protested that the action challenged their sovereignty. In May 2018, an agreement was signed pledging greater rights for Filipino migrant workers; the deployment ban was eventually lifted.
2019 OFW death.
On December 31, 2019, an OFW named Joanna Demafelis was reportedly killed by the employer's wife, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). The DFA condemned the death of the woman, "calling it a violation of the agreement signed by the Philippine and Kuwaiti governments in 2018 for their protection." An autopsy was conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) revealed that the woman was sexually abused prior to her death.

Dolores Crow

Dolores J. Crow (née York; November 14, 1931 – February 9, 2018) was an American politician who served as a member of the Idaho House of Representatives from 1982 to 2006.
Early life.
Crow was born in Clovis, New Mexico. In 1933, her family moved to Jerome, Idaho, where she attended Jerome High School. She worked several administrative jobs, including one at the Idaho State Capitol, where she heard of an opening in the state legislature for her district in 1982.
Career.
Crow accepted the position as a state legislator, and was re-elected successively for 24 years. During her career, she served on several committees and chaired both the House Revenue and Taxation and the Environmental Affairs Committees. She also served as a member of the Permanent Building Fund Advisory Counsel and was appointed by the Governor of Idaho to be a Commissioner overseeing the restoration of the Capitol. She retired in 2006.
Crow was also co-chair of the newly-formed Redistricting Committee of Idaho in 2011, which was tasked with redrawing state boundaries for legislative districts in response to population changes following the 2010 U.S. census, as mandated by the state constitution. House Speaker Lawerence Denney called for her resignation from the commission, because his members believed that she didn't do enough to protect Republican interests. However, she remained on the commission to continue its work.
Personal life.
In the late-1940s, while attending business college in Salt Lake City, she met Wayne Crow and they were married October 22, 1950. In November 1950, he was drafted into military service, and the couple moved to Port Townsend, Washington. After his discharge in 1952, they moved to Moscow, Idaho so he could finish his degree at the University of Idaho. After his graduation in 1956, they moved to Nampa, Idaho, where they raised six children.
Crow died on February 9, 2018, at the age of 86.

Lisandro Martínez (born 18 January 1998) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Eredivisie club Ajax and the Argentina national team.
Club career.
Martínez had youth spells with Club Urquiza (Gualeguay, Entre Rios), Club Libertad (Gualeguay, Entre Rios) and Newell's Old Boys. He made his professional debut for Newell's in the club's final fixture of the 2016–17 season, he played the full match in a loss to Godoy Cruz. In August 2017, Martínez joined fellow Argentine Primera División side Defensa y Justicia on loan. His first appearance for Defensa arrived on 13 October in a defeat against San Lorenzo. Two appearances later, he scored his first senior goal in an away win versus Temperley. Defensa y Justicia signed Martínez permanently in June 2018.
On 17 May 2019, Defensa y Justicia announced that a deal had been agreed with Eredivisie team Ajax; subject to the passing of a medical. Ajax announced the completion of the medical on 20 May, with the transfer to go through on 1 July. He penned a four-year contract, with the option of a further year. He didn't officially join until July, though did feature in June friendlies with Quick '20 and AaB. His competitive bow came in the 2019 Johan Cruyff Shield against PSV Eindhoven, as Ajax won the trophy following a two-goal victory. He was voted man of the match in his second Eredivisie game; in a win over FC Emmen.
Martínez netted his first Ajax goal on 28 September, as he opened the scoring in a 2–0 victory over FC Groningen at the Johan Cruyff Arena. He scored again against Utrecht in November, in a campaign which was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In his first match of 2020–21, Martínez got his third Ajax goal in a home win versus RKC Waalwijk on 20 September.
International career.
Martínez won four caps for the Argentina U20s at the 2017 South American Youth Football Championship in Ecuador. The first came during the first stage against Venezuela, while the other three arrived during the final stage as Argentina finished 4th and subsequently qualified for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup in South Korea.

In March 2019, Martínez received his first call-up to the senior team. He won his opening cap as they lost in Madrid to Venezuela on 22 March.
Martínez was selected for Fernando Batista's U23s in September 2019, ahead of an exhibition encounter with Bolivia.

ESL Pro League Season 1

ESL Pro League Season 1, officially known as ESL ESEA Pro League Season 1 and shortened as EPL Season 1, was an Electronic Sports League (ESL) tournament. It was the first season of the ESL Pro League. The Finals took place in Cologne, Germany from July 2, 2015 to July 5, 2015. Teams from two continents, North America and Europe, competed in twelve team leagues and play against each other twice to determine the top four teams from each continent would play in the Finals.
The regular season for Europe began on May 4, 2015 with Team Dignitas beating Titan and ended on June 24, 2015 with the same two teams with the same result. North America's season began on the same date and kicked off with Luminosity Gaming defeating Method and ended with Method defeating mouseSpaz. The season officially concluded with Fnatic defeating Cloud9 in a close best of five finals, 3–1.
Format.
On April 28, 2015, ESL announced a joint venture with ESEA to provide a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league with US$1,000,000 in total prize money in 2015. ESL invited twelve teams to each league to participate in its professional league. Each team would face off against every other team twice to play in twenty-two games throughout the eight week season. The top four teams from each continent would move on to the finals in Germany and would be automatically invited to the next season. Teams that placed fifth to ninth would not qualify for the finals, but would still be invited to Season 2. Teams that placed tenth and eleventh would have to play in a relegation phase, in which those teams and teams that placed second and third in ESEA Season 19's Premier League, the league under the Pro League, would face off to qualify for two spots in next season's Pro League. The team that placed first in the Premier League would qualify for Season 2. The team that placed twelfth in the Pro League would automatically be demoted to the Premier League.
The finals consisted of eight teams, four from Europe and four from North America. The teams would be placed in two groups and play in a four team, double elimination GSL group stage. In each group, the highest seed played against the lowest seed and then the other two teams would play a best of one game. Then, the winners would play against each other to determine which team takes the top spot. The losers would fight it out to determine which team goes home. The top seed would earn an automatic berth to the semifinals. The playoffs consisted of six teams. The loser of the winners' match and the winner of the losers' match in the group stage would face off against each other in the Round of 6 in a best of three. The winners of those matches went on to face the opposite group stage winner, such that the top seed of Group A would face off against the runner-up of Group B, and vice versa. The winners of those matches would move on to the finals in a best of five series.

Miniature Railway at Silver Lake, Ohio

The Miniature Railway at Silver Lake, Ohio was a gauge miniature railway inaugurated by the Lodge family in 1902 at Silver Lake, Ohio.
History.
The ridable miniature railway was hauled by a scaled-down steam locomotive, but the open passenger cars had no role model. The small locomotive was built around 1901 by the Armitage-Herschell Company of North Tonawanda in Niagara County, New York, as park railways became increasingly popular. The locomotives of this manufacturer could pull up to 10 passenger cars with seats for 40 children or 20 adults.
The steam locomotive, its tender, and three passenger cars were purchased for $1,050 for the locomotive and $75 for each car, equivalent to a price of $1.00 per pound, as the locomotive weighed . The Ohio Steel Company of Cuyahoga Falls made miniature rails with the unusually large weight of , twice as heavy as those for other park railways, as well as switches and their flange-bearing frogs for $42/t.
The railway loop began south of the large pavilion, built in 1898. The station was on the lakeshore at the boat-landing dock. The route led along the lakeshore, passing an old log cabin next to the later aquarium. It then passed the shooting gallery, the stone-built ice store, which was later rebuilt into the cage of the pumas, as well as cages for monkeys, a wolf, raccoons, a badger, and foxes. From there, one could also see the aviaries for an eagle, hawks, and owls, and the bear pits. After the menagerie, it led again along the lake, passed the "Linwood" log-cabin to another stretch along the lakeshore. This original route allowed the passengers a view of the lake and the zoo animals, which made the menagerie quickly known.
The miniature railway with this original route, though, was not as profitable as it should have been, because it was too far away from the main business. The following year, therefore, the track was laid along a new route with a long detour. This doubled the journey time, and the train journey became very popular. Over the years, the route had been changed several times.
Starting in the second summer, the locomotive had to be repaired repeatedly. Steamboat engineer Frank Jones was a valuable aid in repairing the locomotive and its parts. Nevertheless, the locomotive was taken out of service and offered for sale.
Sammy Wise, a little person from Loudonville, Ohio, was employed as the first conductor of the park railway. He was just 48 inches (1.22 m) tall at the age of 28 when he came to Silver Lake. He was well-proportioned and self-important, and very popular with campers and colleagues. In his uniform with a shiny lantern on his left arm and his ticket punch in his right hand, he was an attractive little conductor. He worked with the park railroad for several summers, until his death in the winter of 1906-1907.
George Lodge was very enthusiastic about the train and the locomotive that he had built together with Frank Jones and Sammy Wise in 1903 for several months, using a new boiler of Biggs Boiler Works in Akron. In 1904, he built a more powerful locomotive, which was eventually called the "Little General" and is now on display in Travel Town Museum. After Frank Jones had died, he manufactured another even larger locomotive in his own workshop. He also built five new cars so that two trains with four cars each could drive at the same time.
The summer season of 1917 was the last time the park was operated, but the park railroad continued to be popular and in operation. The selling price of the park did not include the rails, locomotives, and trains. Since William Lodge could not find another buyer, he bought the rails and rolling stock for $1,000 and stored them on his farm. After a few years, he sold the locomotive and wagons to Buckeye Lake Park Co. in Licking County, Ohio. This operated the trains for several summers and then sold them to a park near Toledo, where they were still in operation in 1944.

Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus

Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus (died April 65) was a Roman senator, who flourished under the reign of Nero. He was consul in the year 65 as the colleague of Aulus Licinius Nerva Silianus; after his suicide he was replaced by Publius Pasidienus Firmus.
Family.
Werner Eck identifies Atticus as the son of the "Praefectus Aegypti" Lucius Julius Vestinus. Vestinus Atticus married Statilia Messalina, with whom Tacitus states Nero had an affair prior to their marriage. André Balland has argued that Messalina and Atticus had a son, to whom Martial addressed one of his epigrams (VII.32)
His death.
According to Suetonius, Nero murdered Atticus because he wanted to marry Messalina; after his death, Nero made Messalina his third wife. However, Tacitus provides a more detailed account of how Nero brought about Atticus' downfall: he had been a friend of Nero, but the emperor grew to hate him because Atticus saw through him and despised "the emperor's cowardice, while Nero feared the high spirits of his friend, who often bantered him with that rough humor which, when it draws largely on facts, leaves a bitter memory behind it." Nero had hoped Atticus was party to the disastrous Pisonian conspiracy, but Tacitus reports "many thought" Gaius Calpurnius Piso had not invited Atticus to take part because of his "enterprising spirit" that would replace Piso with another candidate as emperor, or even restore the Republic. When none of the conspirators named him as involved, Nero abused the Law of majestas and dispatched the tribune Gerellanus with a cohort of soldiers to Atticus' house, which towered over the Forum.
The soldiers found Atticus at his house entertaining guests, and delivered the tribune's summons. Understanding the purpose of the summons, Atticus immediately retired to his bed chambers where he killed himself. Meanwhile, the soldiers detained his guests for hours, only allowing them to leave "at a late hour of the night". Tacitus notes that Nero had "laughed over their terror at the expectation of a fatal end to their banquet" before saying "that they had suffered enough punishment for the consul's entertainment" and giving the order to release them.

Runners Without Borders

Runners Without Borders is a non-profit organisation which brings together Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem through the sport of running. The organisation was founded in 2014 in response to violence in Jerusalem at the time. It aims to reduce racism and tension in the city.
Runners Without Borders groups, composed of Jews and Arabs, meet for joint training sessions on a weekly basis. In addition to the training sessions, the groups take part in a social activity once per month. Delegations from Runners Without Borders youth teams have attended international races in Europe, and represented Jerusalem as a team in Milan (April 2015), Berlin (August 2015), and London (September 2016). Additionally, Runners Without Borders' teams have participated in the Jerusalem Marathon every year since it was founded.
History.
The initiative started as a collaboration between Israel Haas, a resident of Jerusalem, and Shoshana Ben-David, a Jerusalem-based high school student. Runners Without Borders initially created a joined running team for Jewish and Arab girls between the ages of 14-19, who came from a wide range of neighbourhoods in east and west Jerusalem. In light of the girls’ group's success, a parallel boys’ group was founded, followed by Arab-Jewish running groups for men and women above the age of 20.
In June 2015 Runners Without Borders’ youth groups planned to attend the Jerusalem Municipality's night run, but were forced to cancel their participation when they discovered that the race was scheduled to take place during the first night of Ramadan. In response, Runners Without Borders created its own race.
The first Jewish-Arab race put on by Runners Without Borders took place between Beit Safafa and Malha (in south-west Jerusalem), with 87 participants. They produced two additional races along this route, and in March 2017 launched the first ever Jewish-Arab race in east Jerusalem, which took place between the Arab neighbourhoods of Abu Tor and Jabel Mukaber. Since then Runners Without Borders have produced three races in East Jerusalem, with over 700 runners in the November 2017 race.

Liebenstein Castle (Saxony)

Liebenstein Castle () is a ruined castle on a rocky hill spur in the Schwarzwassertal valley near Pobershau. The spur castle was probably built in the 12th century and may have guarded the road through the valley.
History.
According to archaeological evidence, there was a medieval fortification on the steep-sided, Liebenstein hill spur from the 12th to the 14th century. It may well have been the seat of a village-based, lordly estate perhaps even ruled by a Bohemian vassal. That said, Bohemian influence here is doubtful because the area in question was then uninhabited native forest. 
It is quite likely that the present abandoned village of Ullersdorf was connected with this fortification and it may be assumed that it functioned as a local base during the colonization of the area. At the same time, the fortification and settlement are thought to be the furthest outpost of a region in which settlement began in the second half of the 12th century - something obviously facilitated by one of the so-called Bohemian tracks.
The name Liebenstein only appears on later maps. In the common parlance the castle ruins are referred to as the "Raubschloss" or 'robber baron's castle'.
The castle had a total length of approximately 90 metres and a width of 25 metres. The fortifications consisted of two simple ditches with an intermediate earth bank to seal it off from the hinterland. The interior of the castle consisted of two parts: an almost square area separated by a cross ditch from the elevated inner bailey, which is formed by a rocky cliff partly covered with dry masonry.
The ruins and the remains of a strong tower were said to have been still visible until the 18th century.
Present.
Today only wall remains and dressed stone blocks are still visible on the Liebenstein. An information board near the excavation area gives the history of the place.

Like I Do (David Guetta, Martin Garrix and Brooks song)

"Like I Do" is a song by French record producer David Guetta and Dutch music producers Martin Garrix and Brooks. Written by Talay Riley, Sean Douglas, Nick Seeley, Robert Bergin and its producers Guetta, Garrix, Brooks and Giorgio Tuinfort, it was released on 22 February 2018 by What a Music, as the second single from Guetta's seventh studio album, "7" (2018).
Background.
Guetta said of the song: "When we hit the studio we were already working on several tracks. After we saw the great response on 'So Far Away' we thought f*** it, we will release another track together straight away." Garrix added: "David is a legend. I have a lot of respect for him as an artist and I'm very happy we were able to release another track together with the amazing Brooks who I have worked with on other records before. I think he's one of the most talented producers out there."
Release and promotion.
Garrix originally premiered the song during his TimeOut72 Festival set in Goa, India. On 14 February 2018, Guetta and Brooks released a teaser of the song on social media, revealing its release date. A remix contest for the song was held in association with the app Soonvibes, winners were selected as part of the official remixes.
Composition.
"Like I Do" is a big room house track, with vocals provided by Talay Riley. It blends elements from future bounce and pop with "heavy bass and a dancefloor-ready beat". On the opening lines, the voice rises "over shimmering synths and a fizzing production", before building up into "an earworm-worthy chorus". According to "Billboard"s Kat Bein, the song is "a stomping mix of horns and bass that's funky".
Critical reception.
In a positive review, a Your EDM contributor regarded the song as "a wonderfully melodic new release that's a surefire radio hit with an EDM-friendly drop that Garrix and Brooks fans will both appreciate". Mike Nied of Idolator called the collaboration "refreshing", deeming the song "a blending of all their respective sounds".

My Side of Town (song)

"My Side of Town" is a song by American singer Lutricia McNeal, released as the second single from her debut studio album of the same name (1997) and the follow-up to her 1996 international hit "Ain't That Just the Way". "My Side of Town" charted within the top 40 of the charts of Iceland, the Netherlands, and Sweden in 1997. In 1999, it reached number one in New Zealand.
Critical reception.
AllMusic editor Jaime Sunao Ikeda picked "My Side of Town" as one of two standout tracks from the album.
Chart performance.
"My Side of Town" did not match the chart success of "Ain't That Just the Way" in Europe, but it peaked at number 17 in the Netherlands, number 30 in Sweden, number 31 in Iceland, and number 73 in Germany. It did not chart in the United Kingdom, where "Ain't That Just the Way" peaked at number four, but her success in the UK would continue with "Stranded".
In 1998, McNeal's music began to gain popularity in New Zealand, with two hits, "Ain't That Just the Way" and "Stranded", reaching the top three; "My Side of Town" followed these hits. It first appeared on the Recorded Music NZ (then RIANZ) chart at number 43 on January 24, 1999, then reached number 7 three weeks later. It dropped out of the top 10 for the next three weeks, then rose 12 places to the number-one position on March 14. "My Side of Town" spent 12 weeks on the New Zealand chart, making its last appearance at number 29 on April 11, 1999. Despite its success, this song was McNeal's last top-20 in New Zealand.
Music video.
Two different music videos were made for the song. One of them was directed by Stuart Gosling.

Portugal–Thailand relations

Relations between Portugal and Thailand date as far as the 16th century. Portugal was the first European nation to make contact with the Ayutthaya Kingdom, in 1511. The Portuguese became dominant foreign traders, and established a presence in the capital. Portuguese traders introduced firearms as well as New-World goods from the Columbian Exchange, influencing Thai cuisine, language and culture. Although Portugal's overseas influence gradually declined from the 17th century, it maintained ties with Siam. The Portuguese Embassy in Bangkok, established in 1820, is the oldest diplomatic mission in the country. In contrast to other European powers, against whose colonial aspirations Siam struggled during the 19th century, Siam's relationship with Portugal was largely friendly. Both countries elevated their missions to embassy status in 1964, and Thailand established a resident embassy in Lisbon in 1981. Today, the two countries share a small amount of trade, tourism and cultural activities.
History.
Portugal was the first European nation to make contact with Siam, in 1511 during the Ayutthaya period. Many Portuguese settlers became mercenaries of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. In 1538 during the reign of King Chairacha 120 Portuguese soldiers marched with the King on campaign against his enemies and were rewarded commercial privileges and living quarters in Ayutthaya. 
Portuguese diaspora in Thailand.
Portuguese settlers formed a large community in Ayutthaya, where an extensive Portuguese quarter was established south of the city. Following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Portuguese regathered at three locations in Bangkok: around the Immaculate Conception Church in the Samsen area, Santa Cruz Church in Kudi Chin, and Holy Rosary Church in Talat Noi. Their descendants have gradually assimilated into Thai society, though the community, especially at Kudi Chin, still retains a distinctive identity.

She was born in Vera Cruz, Mexico, to French and English parents. She performed in Mexican circuses as a slackwire artist. In 1909, agents of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus recruited her and her younger brothers, Alfredo and Abelardo Codona, to perform with them. She worked for Barnum &amp; Bailey until 1918 and also performed in Australia with the Brothers Circus. She was known as Princess Victoria and was a wire-walker. 
She retired from performing when she was pregnant with her first child with William K. Adolph, a race car driver, and they retired to Palm Springs where she died in 1983 at the age of 92. In 2014, the U.S. Postal Service created a stamp of her as part of an eight stamp collection paying tribute to circus legends of the past.

Paris-Versailles Race

The Paris-Versailles Race (Course Paris-Versailles, also known as "La Grande Classique") is a pedestrian race that takes place between Paris and Versailles in France, every year on the last Sunday morning of September. Organized by Paris-Versailles Association, it takes place on a course of 16 km, from the foot of the Eiffel Tower to the Palace of Versailles, via Issy-les-Moulineaux, Meudon, Chaville, Vélizy-Villacoublay, Viroflay and Meudon.
The 40th anniversary race took place on September 24, 2017 More than 22,000 runners participated in the race, whose winners were Ethiopian runners Getinet Gedamu and Chaltu-Dida Negasa.
Course Details.
The race is noted for its unusual and demanding course through seven communities from the Eiffel Tower to the Palace of Versailles, running uphill for most of its length and finishing more than 100 meters higher than the start. After 6 km very flat along the Seine, the route takes the famous coast of the Gardes. This section has a slope of up to 9% and is over 2km long making it the most difficult part of the race. The last 2 km are also feared because they run on the Avenue de Paris, a very wide double track (and therefore generally windy) in false flat which is often described as endless.

Murtoa Stick Shed

Murtoa Stick Shed, formally known as the Number 1 Emergency Grain Store, is a large grain store (silo) in Murtoa, a town in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia. 
It is located adjacent to the railway line in western Victoria’s vast wheatbelt
560 upright poles, some 80-foot-long, went into building the cathedral-like structure. Many more poles went into fabricating the roof trusses and bracing.
The slender mountain ash poles were probably salvaged from native forests at Powelltown, Noojee and Erica burnt during the 1939 bushfires.
The Murtoa Stick Shed, as it became known, is 870 feet long, 198 feet wide and 62 feet 10 inches high at the ridge, covering an area of 170,000 square feet and with a capacity of 3.4 million bushels or 95,000 tonnes. 
Australia experienced a wheat glut in the late 1930s as traditional export markets of Great Britain and Western Europe evaporated due to a shift in world trade and restrictions to shipping.
By the outbreak of the War in 1939, the Australian wheat industry produced between 150 and 160 million bushels per year, of which 100 million had been traditionally exported.
But only 48 of the 160 silos planned under the 1935 Victorian Silo Scheme had been completed.
The Murtoa Stick Shed was hurriedly built over four months between September 1941 and January 1942 and filled with grain within six months of its construction. The wheat stayed in storage until 1944.
It was the first emergency bulk wheat storage shed built in Victoria and is the only one remaining of its type in Australia. 
Wartime shortages meant the builders had to rely upon and adapt traditional bush construction techniques. It’s claimed to be the largest “rustically-built” structure in the world.
The Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) produced over half a million lineal feet of poles from State forests mainly for emergency storage of wheat in 1941/42. 
"FCV Annual Report 1941--42" “Poles and piles were in heavy demand throughout the year, and in view of the shortage of private operators an increasingly large quantity was supplied direct by the Commission's organization.  The poles were for use for all purposes and included large quantities for the erection of emergency storage sheds and for special purposes to meet requirements of the Army and Air Force.  Large numbers of the poles were supplied in lengths ranging from 60 feet to 100 feet, and in one case two 120-ft. Yellow Stringy bark poles were supplied and railed from Eastern Gippsland.” "FCV Annual Report 1942--43" “Output of pole timbers increased substantially, and large quantities were supplied to the order of the Australian Wheat Board and other authorities for the construction of emergency storage accommodation.  Included in deliveries were 36 poles 100 feet long from Orbost and Beaufort.”"FCV Annual Report 1943--44." “With the Wheat Board's operations completed, the demand for poles has been considerably less, but poles for the Postmaster-General's Department, the Army and other bodies have been supplied throughout the year."A second and much larger Stick Shed, with double the capacity, was erected in 1942/43 at Murtoa using poles largely supplied from forests at East Gippsland and Beaufort. This second shed was demolished in 1975.
The Murtoa Stick Shed No 1 became increasingly expensive to maintain and was eventually phased out of service from 1989.
The building was listed on the Australian National Heritage List in 2014, recognising its place "as a significant part of Australia’s history associated with Australia’s wheat industry and the impact of World War Two on the home front".

2018 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship Final

The 2018 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship final was a hurling match played at Croke Park on 17 March 2018 to determine the winners of the 2017-18 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, the 48th season of the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, a tournament organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association for the champion clubs of the four provinces of Ireland. The final was contested by Cuala of Dublin and Na Piarsaigh of Limerick, with the game ending in a 1-22 to 2-19 draw. The replay took place on 24 March 2018, with Cuala winning by 2-17 to 1-17.
The All-Ireland final was a unique occasion as it was the first ever championship meeting between Cuala and Na Piarsaigh. Cuala were appearing in their second successive final and were hoping to retain the title, while Na Piarsaigh were lining out in their second All-Ireland decider ever and their first since 2016.
Na Piarsaigh appeared to be cruising to victory as added-time approached, but Seán Moran fired a 63rd minute free to the net to force extra-time. David Treacy came to the rescue at the death after both teams battled it out for 20 minutes of extra-time. David Breen goaled for the Limerick champions in the first period of extra-time, but points from Con O'Callaghan and Mark Schutte – both of whom had been held scoreless until then – and Treacy’s 12 frees ensured a second shot for Cuala.
The replay a week later saw Cuala take a slender 0-10 to 0-09 lead at half-time. 
The game turned in Cuala's favour in the 39th minute when Tommy Grimes' stray hand pass was intercepted by Nicky Kenny and punished for a goal. Mark Schutte seized possession from the puck-out and took off on a solo run down the left before slamming the ball to the net for a second. Cuala led 2-11 to 0-11 and looked to be in pole position to retain their crown, however, Na Piarsaigh were at the very best in the final quarter. Cuala surrendered a six-point lead during this period to trail Na Piarsaigh by one with 60 minutes played. Con O'Callaghan scored the point that levelled the game for the eighth time, then won a free that top scorer David Treacy converted and finally laid off a pass after a great catch for Mark Schutte to hit the insurance score for Cuala. 
Cuala's victory secured their second successive All-Ireland title.

Blackmail (2018 film)

Blackmail (stylised as Blackमेल) is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language black comedy film co-produced and directed by Abhinay Deo. The film stars Irrfan, Kirti Kulhari, Arunoday Singh and Divya Dutta in lead roles and is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, Apurba Sengupta and Rohit KaduDeshmukh under the banner of T-Series Films and RDP Motion Pictures. "Blackmail" depicts the life of a married-man in his late 30s stuck in a full day-time job and unexciting life but things turn after he finds that his wife is having an extramarital affair. The film had its theatrical release in India on 6 April 2018 and turned out to be a flop at the box office.
Plot.
Dev Kaushal (Irrfan) is a toilet paper sales executive who is leading a dispirited life both professionally and personally. He steals the photographs of other men's wives for his personal pleasure and gratification.
One day, to surprise his wife Reena Kaushal (Kirti Kulhari) he arrives early from office with roses but instead finds his wife in bed with another man named Ranjit "Tommy" Arora (Arunoday Singh). He imagines different scenarios, like killing the lover, then killing the wife, but leaves and decides to blackmail him.
Ranjit is a hen pecked husband married to Dolly Verma (Divya Dutta), who has an influential dad, who Ranjit is scared of. Dev shares a great bond with his Boss DK (Omi Vaidya) who asks him to promote the new toilet rolls. After calculating all the things he has to pay, Dev blackmails Ranjit for a sum of 1 lakh. Ranjit arranges the money from Dolly by lying of starting a business. When Dolly's father asks Ranjit to return the money, he blackmails Reena for 120,000. In a drunken state, Dev reveals everything to his colleague Anand (Pradhuman Singh Mall). Reena asks Dev for money, saying that its for her dad's treatment. Dev gives her the money and in turn asks Ranjit for more money. Reena keeps the money in a dust bin which Ranjit collects and leaves it in a trash bin which Dev then collects.
Anand, who has a crush on Prabha Ghatpandey (Anuja Sathe), a newly appointed colleague gets her on a date and unintentionally reveals Dev's plans. Next day Prabha blackmails Dev for money. Dev confronts Anand but then asks Ranjit for money, Ranjit in turn asks Reena for money and Reena asks Dev for the money. From the cash received earlier Dev transacts the amount to Reena's account, while Reena puts the money in a dustbin. Ranjit collects it, and throws it in a dustbin which Dev collects and gives to Prabha.
Ranjit gets fed up and hires a detective, Chawla (Gajraj Rao). Prabha blackmails Dev for more money. Dev decides to meet Prabha and they share a heated argument in her apartment. Prabha slips during the argument and falls as an entire shelf falls on her, killing her. Suddenly Prabha's parents arrive. Dev manages to escape by wearing mask made out of a Paper bag and runs outside wearing only shorts while being chased by nearby residents.
Next morning following Prabha's death, police arrive and interrogates everyone in the office. Anand knowing that Dev met Prabha last night, blackmails Dev. On interrogation Dev reveals that Anand used to like Prabha. Dev convinces Anand to hide the truth from the police. Using Anand's car Dev purchases a similar paper bag he used last night to escape and hides it in Anand's car, following which the police arrest Anand. Anand panics and reveals everything about Dev to the police. Meanwhile, Chawla calls Dev telling him he knows about his ruse while Ranjit manages to get a gun to kill The Blackmailer.
The police then interrogates Dev about his blackmail activities. Dolly follows Ranjit and sees him together with Reena in cinema hall. Anand comes out of police custody and tries to fight with Dev, but Dev manages to calm him down, claiming he has a master plan to gain lakhs of money. Dev meets Chawla who starts blackmailing him for money too to remain silent. Back at home Dolly tries to kill Ranjit, and as they fight Ranjit ends up shooting her dead. Aghast, he hides her body in the Refrigerator. Dev texts Ranjit asking for money (to pay Chawla), warning he would tell Dolly otherwise. Ranjit tells him to go ahead, but then Dev messages back saying he will tell Dolly's dad. Ranjit asks Reena for more money, and Reena then asks Dev for money claiming that its for her father's urgent surgery. 
Fed up, Dev calls Reena's parents and finds out that she has been lying. When Reena sells her jewelry to pay her blackmailer, Dev follows her watching her sell jewelry and then dropping the cash in the waste bin at a Mall. Dev walks over to take it out, but Ranjit comes over there first and takes the money. Dev takes pictures of Ranjit taking the money. Ranjit hides the money in the dustbin and waits there himself to catch the blackmailer. Dev sees Ranjit watching and bribes a security guard to take out wrapper of that money. Ranjit tries to catch the guard, as Dev collects the money and then later gives it to Chawla. He asks Chawla for a favor in return, to call Ranjit and tell him that the blackmailer is Anand. Furious, Ranjit kills Anand. Dev sends the pictures of Ranjit taking money from Mall's bin to Reena. Meanwhile, Dolly's parents find out that Ranjit murdered their daughter and lock him up in a bathroom and call the police.
Back at home, heart broken Reena deletes Ranjit's contact from her phone. She then makes dinner and messages Dev asking when he will come home. A depressed Dev receives the message and deletes Reena's contact too, while the screen shows that he has won the Pac-Man (Pac-Man) computer game that he always failed at earlier.
Next morning, when the water supply is cut during the toilet paper launch, the people starts buying water from Jet Spray company making them huge profits. Dev's boss DK goes berserk seeing his marketing plan failing as his employees watch.
Production.
Development.
The genesis of the film traces back to 2014 when Abhinay Deo had announced that his next film would be a dark comedy set in Mumbai. In January 2015, it was reported that Rakesh Roshan would be producing Abhinay Deo's next film which would have Irrfan Khan and Aditi Rao Hydari as the lead actors playing husband and wife. Kunal Kapoor, Kunaal Roy Kapur and Vijay Raaz were also signed on to be a part of the project and the shooting was supposed to begin at the end of February. In June 2015, it was reported that Rakesh Roshan had dropped the project that he was doing with Abhinay Deo citing creative differences. One year later in August 2016, Abhinay Deo said that after he completed the work on "Force 2", he planned to revive the film that he was supposed to do with Irrfan Khan before it was shelved. In November 2016, Abhinay Deo's film was given a working title of "Blackmail" and in February 2017 it was confirmed that T-Series had come on board to produce the film along with co-producer Rohit KaduDeshmukh. In April 2017, it was reported that the title of the film had been changed to "Raita" and Kirti Kulhari would be playing the role of Irrfan's wife in the film instead of Aditi Rao Hydari who was the first choice of the director. The principal photography of the film began on 4 April 2017 and the entire shoot was done in Mumbai itself.

Critical reception.
Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that, "It’s the film’s unique brand of humor – some of it pitch black and Coen-esque – that makes Blackmail worth your time, despite its shortcomings." Sweta Kausal of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that "Blackmail" is a "Fun filled and realistic story-telling made interesting with engaging and hilarious performances of Irrfan Khan and Divya Dutta". Rachit Gupta of "The Times of India" gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, "The plot of Blackmail is its hero and it manages to strike a good balance between dark and funny. This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we’ve seen in a long time." Raja Sen of NDTV gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "Irrfan is incapable of giving a bad performance but Abhinay Deo's farce is too tacky and poorly-conceived to do Khan justice". Shubhra Gupta of "The Indian Express" gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said that, "The Irrfan Khan starrer begins promisingly but descends pretty quickly into flatness and sluggishness, a classic problem of not knowing quite how to play out a perky idea."

The district has been represented by Kantoku Teruya of the Social Democratic Party since 2003. Teruya is the only SDP politician in the country to currently hold a single-seat constituency.

The district has been considered a stronghold for veteran Social Democrat Kantoku Teruya, who has held the district continuously since 2003. Such is the strength of the SDP vote in the district that during the LDP landslides in 2005 and 2012, Teruya still managed to hold the district comfortably. The significant presence of US military bases in Ginowan is regarded as a major factor contributing to the wide aversion of the local population to voting LDP candidates, who are typically pro-base.
Okinawa-2nd is also one of the few districts that the . The party has continuously endorsed Teruya in each election since 2009. Other centre-left parties have also generally refrained from contesting the district and regularly back Teruya in general elections.

Zoë Brock is a model and writer from New Zealand.
Early years.
Brock was born in 1974 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, in 1986. 
Modelling and acting career.
Brock started modelling when she was 14 years old. Her first work was with Vogue Australia. She has also worked for Vogue Italia, Elle, Cosmopolitan, L'Uomo Vogue, Vogue UK, French Vogue and Vogue USA. Brock later walked in Fashion Week shows in Europe and New York for designers including Giorgio Armani, Vivienne Westwood, Fendi, Fiorucci, Gianfranco Ferre, Thierry Mugler and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Her acting credits include She Spies and Going to California with Vince Vaughn.
After acting.
Brock delayed her acting career for several years after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein in 1997 and then quit acting and Hollywood altogether in 2003 shortly after seeing Weinstein in public. She moved to San Francisco, where she worked as a web designer and marketing manager in Silicon Valley. 
Brock relocated back to Australia to give birth to a child in 2017.
#MeToo.
Brock is one of the first women to come forward with claims of sexual violence that helped birth the MeToo movement. In October 2017, two days after the story broke in The New York Times, she published an article alleging that Harvey Weinstein had sexually assaulted her in 1997 while they were both in Cannes for the Cannes Film Festival. She and five other women filed a class action lawsuit against Weinstein alleging that The Weinstein Company was aware of his alleged sexual misconduct and was complicit in helping him cover up the behavior.
In March 2018 Brock appeared as herself in the PBS Frontline episode "Weinstein". She also appeared in the BBC Panorama version.
In May 2018 the class action suit was amended to nine accusers.
The Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
Shortly after publishing her Weinstein article on Medium in October 2017, Brock wrote another article detailing her sexual harassment in 1992 at the hands of her French modelling agent Jean Luc Brunel. Brunel is accused of sex-trafficking underage girls to Jeffrey Epstein and of exploiting, raping and drugging young models since he was first exposed by a CBS 60 Minutes episode that aired in 1988.
Multiple women and some men have come forward to try to help French and US police locate Brunel.

Marlo Anderson

Marlo Anderson (born October 23, 1962) is a technology talk show host and the founder of "National Day Calendar".
Early life and education.
Marlo Anderson grew up around the Minot, North Dakota area. He graduated High School in 1980 in the rural community of Des Lacs, ND.
Career.
In 1999, Nicholas Ressler and Anderson formed "Awesome 2 Productions" in Mandan, ND. The company does video production work for car shows and other events. During this time, the two were curious about what was going to happen with all the memories on video tapes. So in 2007, they developed a new company called "Zoovio", which transcodes video tape to a digital format which is stored in a private, online vault, and can be played back on any smart device and connected television.
In Jan 2013, Anderson started the radio talk show known as "The Tech Ranch". In addition to the weekly talk show, The Tech Ranch covers events such as CES. Anderson who is also known as the “Guru of Geek” is a frequent contributor to regional and National news stories in the technology space. His holiday top tech gifts are an annual favorite and are featured far and wide.
Anderson is also an Advocate for Autonomous Vehicles – most notably the "Autonomous Friendly Corridor". This idea came about in response to the lack of north–south avenues to move commercial goods in the middle part of the U.S.
Anderson is a Central North American Trade Corridor Director. CNATCA first made its idea for the Autonomous Friendly Corridor public on March 20, 2014. In his capacity as a CNATCA Director, Anderson is often quoted for his optimism about the future and the current technologies that are revolutionizing the transportation industry. While hosting the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Roadshow in May 2015, he said, “It gets people thinking ‘what if.’ It opens eyes and minds to the possibility of what is going to be available in a couple of years.”
Anderson’s zeal for the future is balanced with his propensity to preserve the past. This is evident in his TedX UMary talk of 2017 entitled “Our Bright Future,” in which he discusses the lessons we can learn from our early 20th century ancestors as they grappled with the issue of horse manure. Wasting astronomical resources on a problem that was soon solved through the technological advancement of the “horseless carriage” is a parallel to our present day transportation issues at the dawn of the autonomous age.
The self proclaimed futurist has also spoken at Tedx Fargo on the topic for which he is best known, his National Day Calendar motto of Celebrate Every Day.
As chairman of the Mandan Independence Day Parade for nearly 25 years, Anderson has seen such distinctions as the World's Longest Chicken Dance (1.6 miles ) in 2010 and in 2012 being a finalist in the Rand McNally Most Patriotic City competition.
Anderson's Talking Trail. Encouraging travelers of the Old Red/Old Ten Scenic Byway between Mandan and Dickinson to slow down and discover some 39 points of interest, Talking Trail invites participants to call the phone number and extensions listed on signs marking the historical sites located along this 108-mile road, known since 2008 as the 10th Federal Highway Administration Scenic Byway in North Dakota. Anderson hopes to promote a sense of discovery for these sites which include statues in Mandan of Peter Toth, honoring Native Americans and Theodore Roosevelt all the way to the old Fort Keogh Trail, which was once crossed by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in 1870 when he marched the Seventh Cavalry to Montana.
As acting president of the North Dakota Music Hall of Fame, Anderson oversaw the creation and installation of the public art display at Dykshoorn park in downtown Mandan, ND, entitled “North Dakota Music Lane” which celebrates four North Dakota Music Hall of Fame inductees including Lawrence Welk, Bobby Vee, Peggy Lee and Lynn Anderson.
Anderson is one of the founders of the 1 Million Cups chapters in North Dakota. He is also a founding committee member and 2017 moderator for the "DisruptWell" Summit in Bismarck, ND. "DisruptWell" is a conference featuring disruptive technologies in the fields of transportation, healthcare, energy, and education.
Anderson serves on several boards in his own community of Mandan, ND and as recently as 2018 became one of the 22 committee members for the West End Redevelopment Committee which seeks to redevelop the Thrifty White Drug and Central Market Properties.
National Day Calendar.
On January 19, 2013, Anderson founded the "National Day Calendar". The site quickly became a popular destination for media wanting to know more about how the National Days came to be. Anderson's team has also been responsible for creating close to 200 new National Days including National Astronaut Day and "National Bobblehead Day". Over 20,000 media outlets and personalities follow Anderson's daily post and use his content as prep for their daily shows. National Day Calendar has turned unknown holidays such as National Pizza Day and National Coffee Day into a trending topic on social media. Anderson has also been featured in articles that discuss the effect his trend has on the national economy. Chinese retailer Alibaba has capitalized on Singles’ Day by promoting it in their marketing as a day to buy something for themselves.

. She also sang in Kabita (1977) for actress Mala Sinha.
Rapport with Yogesh.
After the death of lyricist Shailendra, Salil Chowdhury was looking for another writer. He gave Yogesh half an hour to write a song. Yogesh got nervous and he went to Sabita for help. "Salilda’s assistant laughed and said a novice like me could never do justice to Salilda’s tunes. That shook my confidence." A dejected Yogesh walked out, but while waiting for the bus, was struck by some lines. He went back to Salil da and recited them. "He started screaming out to his wife, Sabita di. I thought he would tell her how incompetent I was, and then kick me out. Instead, he told her that I had written some beautiful lyrics".
Death.
Sabita Chowdhury died on 28 June 2017 due to lung cancer that she was suffering from. She was 72. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee deeply mourned her death.

<doc id="56585839" url="?curid=56585839" title="Rubus gunnianus">
Rubus gunnianus

Rubus gunnianus is a species in the genus "Rubus" of the family Rosaceae. It is a small herb that grows in subalpine and alpine habitats above 900m throughout Tasmania, and bears edible fruit. It is commonly known as the native strawberry or Tasmanian alpine raspberry.
Taxonomy.
The name "Gunnianus" comes from the botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn. Gunn worked closely with Ronald Lawrence; who knew British botanist Joseph Hooker. The authority of this species was named after Hooker. Gunn travelled around Tasmania, collecting specimens and sending them back for Hooker's book "Introduction to Flora Tasmaniae". Over 50 Tasmanian plant species gained Gunn's name, but a number of names would have since been changed over the years.
Description.
"Rubus gunnianus" is the smallest of all the species in the family Rosaceae. It grows as a small, prostrate herb in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania. When mature, the plant can spread by sending out runners to make the plant larger, as well as by setting seed. Unlike other species of the genus "Rubus", this species does not have any thorns or spines. The leaves grow out from the stem as a florette, and are triangular and glossy green. The palmately compound leaves are composed of three pinnatipartite leaflets (one main one flanked by two smaller ones either side), with very long petioles.
"Rubus gunnianus" is bisexual (having both male and female organs on the same flower), and the flowers are small, white, with five petals. Members of the family Rosaceae are well known for producing edible fruit, which is suitable for bush tucker.
Distribution and habitat.
"Rubus gunnianus" is found in mountainous areas such as alpine moorlands, and subalpine woodlands across Tasmania, including areas such as the Central Coast, Derwent Valley, Hobart, Huon Valley and the West Coast. It is frost hardy, which is essential to alpine environments, due to the harsh weather and exposed conditions at high altitude. It prefers moist, sheltered areas among mosses and leaf litter, where it can survive the harsh conditions of alpine areas, but it can also survive in semi-exposed areas. 
Uses.
The red, raspberry-looking fruit is edible; and is made up of a few drupes. A purple dye can be made from the fruit juice. Members of the genus "Rubus" are well known for their nutritional benefits of being high in vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, iron and copper, while being low in sugar. This species is suitable for domestic cultivation, and "R. gunnianus" may be a good choice for people with limited space to grow plants, because it is quite small and would take up little room. It can also be grown in pots. "R. gunnianus" requires well drained moist soils, part shade to full sun, and is suitable in a variety of soil types in alpine and subalpine areas.
Conservation status.
"Rubus gunnianus" has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, however, it is quite common in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania; therefore no conservation concern is required at present.

The calimero are an Aboriginal Australian people of the Cape York Peninsula in the state of Calimeroland. They are to be distinguished from the calimero of Calimeroland and the piccolo calimero of the Northern little calimero, who have also historically been known as calimero.
CALIMERO IS THE BEST
Country.
In Norman Tindale's estimation, the Kukatj held about of tribal land. Their eastward extension, from Inverleigh reached the Flinders River, and running northwards from the area of the Donor Hills up to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Frontier wars.
When European settlers moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria region and established Normanton in the 1870s, there were an estimated seven Aboriginal peoples in the area, and the frontier wars blurred and confused the boundaries of traditional lands. By the 1920s, many Aboriginal people had been forcibly removed to Aboriginal reserves and missions. The Gkuthaarn and Kukatj people who remained lived in camps along the south-western side of the town, while others, such as the Kurtijar people, camped north of the Norman River.
Native title.
On 29 September 2020 the Kukatj and Gkuthaarn peoples won a native title determination over more than west of the Norman River, including Normanton, as far as the Leichhardt River. Their recognition as traditional owners of the land, eight years after lodging the claim, allows the two groups to hunt, hunt and practise their culture and their cultural ceremonies on pastoral land.
Language.
The Kukatj people spoke the Kukatj language, which is now extinct.
Indigenous rangers.
The Gkuthaarn Kukatj Indigenous Land &amp; Sea Ranger group is a group of Indigenous rangers made up of Kukatj and Gkuthaarn people, help to protect the natural resources and cultural heritage of the southern Gulf of Carpentaria region. The group is managed by the Carpentaria Land Council Aboriginal Corporation (CLCAC).

Eustase Thomas-Salignac

Eustase Thomas, known under the stage name Salignac or Thomas-Salignac (29 March 1867 – 6 November 1943 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris) was a French tenor and lyrical singing professor.
Biography.
Born in Générac, Gard department, Eustase Thomas-Salignac was the son of a coffee maker. Initially trained in lyrical singing in Marseille, the city of his childhood, he was a prize-winner of violin and singing. He then joined the Conservatoire de Paris where he followed the courses of Victor Alphonse Duvernoy and won the prize for opéra comique by singing the role of Don José in Bizet's "Carmen". Strengthened by this viaticum, he began in 1893 at the Opéra-Comique in "Richard Cœur-de-Lion".
The following season, his career took on an international dimension, straddling the United States and Great Britain. He made himself known there as the principal tenor of the French lyrical repertoire of his generation. After a tour in the northeast of the country, he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera of New York on 11 December 1896, performing Don José in "Carmen", where he responded to the already famous soprano Emma Calvé. At the end of the season, he returned to London where he sang at Covent Garden from 1897 to 1899. He performed again at the Metropolitan Opera of New York from 1898 to 1903, alternating with Covent Garden where he performed from 1901 to 1904.
Returning to France in 1905, Salignac sang at the Opéra-Comique for the following years, taking up his favourite role of Don José for his return to the national stage. Recruited to the post of director of the in 1912, he gained experience as a show business owner. He became a singing teacher at the American Conservatory of Fontainebleau in 1923, and was the mentor of the American tenor Charles Kullman. From 1924, he taught the course of lyrical declamation at the Conservatoire national de musique et de déclamation. Apart from a short interlude at the head of a French lyrical troupe touring Canada and New York in 1926, Salignac remained faithful to this house where he completed his career. Among the students who followed her instruction was the singer Solange Michel. A renowned professor, he was admitted to retirement on 1 October 1936.
Between the two World Wars, Thomas-Salignac was heavily involved in professional bodies working for the defence and promotion of lyrical art. In March 1922, he founded the periodical "Lyrica", "revue mensuelle illustrée de l'art lyrique et de tous les arts", which he directed until hits handover in March 1939. President of the Professional Union of French Masters of Singing from 1926 to 1939, he was also the founding president of the Académie du Chant, a "grouping for the technical and scientific study of Voice and Singing", in 1929. A renowned and generous artist, he had among his friends, in addition to many professionals of lyrical singing, novelist Roland Dorgelès.
Under the Nazi occupation, he compromised himself by sitting as a member of the Music Section Executive Committee (chaired by composer Max d'Ollone) from the Groupe Collaboration.
Officer of Academy and Public Education, he had been decorated chevalier of the Légion d'honneur on 9 March 1936.
Roles and publications.
Esteemed lyrical tenor, Salignac essentially visited the classical repertoire of the Opéra comique. He also practiced the works of contemporary creators. Interpreter regularly requested by Jules Massenet (title role of "Werther", roles of Jesus in "Marie-Magdeleine" in 1906 and the chevalier des Grieux in "Manon", premiere of "Sapho" in the 1909 version), he was part of the opera cast of Raoul Laparra (premiere of "La Habanera" and "La Jota"), Charles-Marie Widor (premiere of "Les pêcheurs de Saint-Jean", in 1905), Guy Ropartz (premiere of "Le Pays", in 1913) and Darius Milhaud. He sang the title role in Henri Rabaud's "Mârouf, savetier du Caire" when it was revived in 1917-1918. He created Manuel de Falla's chamber opera "El retablo de Maese Pedro", performed in the private theatre of the princesse de Polignac in 1923.
In the opinion of an American critic at Salignac's American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as Don José, "he is not a man of broad body and imposing appearance, and his voice lacks strength and volume... His diction is a little fast, but he sings with accuracy and feeling". The artist's performances were marked by a southern accent that was appreciated by the public.
The oldest recorded fragment of his voice is included in the Mapleson Cylinders. In the single excerpt containing his voice, Salignac can be heard along with Marcella Sembrich in a portion of the love duet from Donizetti's "La Fille du régiment", under the direction of Philippe Flon, during the performance given on 30 January 1903.
With Louis Merlet, Salignac composed with four hands the libretto of an opera put to music by Louis Merlet. Albert Wolff: "Le Marchand de masques", lyrical drama in two acts. The work was premiered in 1914 at the casino municipal de Nice and its booklet published in Paris by Enoch. (1914, 39 p.).
Finally, he co-authored with Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi a posthumous homage book to a couple of opera singers: "Jeanne Myrtale. Jean Moulierat", Rouen, impr. Wolf, 1933, 136 p.

Fanny Nicholson was an iron-framed, timber-clad barque that sank in 1872 in Frenchman's Bay in King George Sound near Albany in the Great Southern region of Western Australia.
The barque was built in Hartlepool in County Durham. It was fitted with one deck, a poop deck, an elliptical stern and a figurehead in the shape of a woman. It was copper-fastened, sheathed with felt and yellow metal. The ship required repairs in 1856 and 1861 for damage incurred while in operation. During its early years of service it was sailed from Liverpool to destinations in South America and was sailed to Australia arriving in 1859.
It was operating as a whaler out of Hobart in 1871, owned by Captain John McArthur and William Andrews.
The ship struck a whale on 21 November 1872 while en route from Hobart to Albany. After tying the whale to the side of the vessel it proceeded to Frenchman's Bay where it anchored to process the whale. The following night a gale rose from the southeast and it broke two anchor cables and foundered close to shore at Goode Beach.
A total of 70 tuns (66,775 litres) of sperm oil, the sails, rigging, whaling equipment, provisions and other contents were recovered from the wreck and shipped to Hobart for auction. The remains of the vessel can sometimes be seen in shallow water after heavy storms.

Çığlı, Çukurca

Çığlı () is a village in Hakkâri Province in southeastern Turkey. It is located in the district of Çukurca and the historical region of Hakkari.
In the village, there were churches of Mar Gewargis and Mar Saba.
Etymology.
The Syriac and Turkish names of the village, Ashitha and Çığlı, respectively, both translate to "avalanche". Ashitha is derived from "ašīthā" ("avalanche" in Syriac), whilst Çığlı is likely a combination of "çığ" ("avalanche" in Turkish) and the adjectival suffix -li.
History.
The church of Mar Saba was constructed in the 4th century. Ashitha was formerly exclusively inhabited by Assyrians, and was the centre of the lower Tyari district, and a "rayyat" (vassal) of the "ashiret" (free men) Tyari clan. It was formed by an aggregation of the villages of Jemane, Jemane Tahtaita, Mata d'Umra-Hatibet, Isrur, and Merwita. The village served as one of two places in the Hakkari region designated by the Patriarch of the Church of the East as a location for the resolution of disputes under the arbitration of a "malik".
A large mission station was built at Ashitha by the American Protestant missionary Asahel Grant in September 1842. By the end of the month, he had also built a school with 20 pupils, and eight mule loads of Syriac books had arrived from Mosul. The size and position of the mission station atop an isolated hill, commanding the whole valley, unnerved Kurds and Turkish authorities, and sparked a series of events that led to the Kurdish massacres in Hakkari in 1843. Although Ashitha was spared after the village clergymen "shamasha" (deacon) Hinno and "kasha" (priest) Jindo had written to the Kurdish emir Bedir Khan Beg to pledge their allegiance and support, a number of villagers fled and took refuge in the village of Musakan in the Barwari region.
Many villagers were killed during the massacres of 1846, and the mission station, which had been converted into a Kurdish fortress, was destroyed during the Ottoman suppression of the revolt of Bedir Khan in 1847. The village was inhabited by 400 Nestorians, and had four priests and one functioning church in 1850. The population dropped to 300 Nestorians, with 20 priests and one church, by 1877. The village was frequently visited by the Nestorian patriarchs Shimun XVII Abraham (r. 1820-1861) and his successor Shimun XVIII Rubil (r. 1861-1903). In the late 19th century, Ashitha was targeted for conversion by Catholic missionaries. Throughout the century, the village had been a major centre of manuscript production.
Ashitha gave its name to the kaza of Chal and Ashitha in the sanjak of Hakkari in the vilayet of Van, which was populated by 200 Jews, 840 Turks, 11,000 Kurds, and 32,000 Assyrians, for a total of 43,890 people in 1900. In 1913, 350 Chaldean Catholics inhabited Ashitha, and were served by one priest as part of the archdiocese of Van. It was claimed in 1913 there was an incumbent Nestorian bishop of Ashitha, however, this is unlikely to be genuine. Amidst the Assyrian genocide in the First World War, Ashitha was attacked by Turks and Kurds under Rashid Bey, Emir of Lower Barwari, on 11 June 1915, and the village was defended under the leadership of Zenkho of Bet Hiob and Lazar of Ashita. Ashitha fell after a day of fighting, and its population of 500 families fled into the mountains.
Villagers returned to rebuild in the early 1920s, but were expelled to Iraq by the Turkish government, and some founded the village of Sarsing in 1924. By 1933, a number of villagers had settled at Kani Balavi, and 15 former inhabitants, with 3 families, settled at Bandwaya by 1938. Ashitha has since been Turkified to Çığlı, and is now wholly populated by Kurds.

Lauw Tek Lok

Lauw Tek Lok, der Chinezen (died in Meester Cornelis in 1882) was a high-ranking government official and landlord in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and a member of the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, part of Java’s Cabang Atas gentry. He is remembered today for his long tenure as "Luitenant der Chinezen" (or government-appointed head mandarin) of Bekasi, and for his interracial marriage with Louisa Zecha.
Born in Batavia, Lauw Tek Lok was the son of the early nineteenth-century tycoon Lauw Ho (died in 1863), part of the powerful Ngo Ho Tjiang opium partnership. His father was an important revenue farmer, and served as "Wijkmeester" (ward master) of Meester Cornelis. The younger Lauw became one of the most important landlords ('Landheeren') in Batavia with significant agricultural landholdings ('particuliere landen') in the city's "Ommelanden" (the then rural hinterland of Batavia), including the estate of Cimanggis.
Lauw was appointed on December 23, 1854 to the newly-created government post of der Chinezen of Bekasi, a civil administrative position he would keep until his death in 1882. At the same time, his brother Lauw Tek Kang was also raised to the post of "Luitenant der Chinezen" of Meester Cornelis. As "Luitenant", Lauw Tek Lok played a significant role in the Dutch colonial development of Bekasi and its surrounding region. On his death in 1882, Lauw was succeeded as "Luitenant der Chinezen" of Bekasi by another local landlord and his son-in-law, Tan Kang Ie.
Despite his satisfactory records as a colonial administrator, Lauw caused some consternation among the colonial authorities due to his unconventional and interracial marriage with an "Indo" woman of Bohemian descent, Louisa Zecha. Together, they became the ancestors of the prominent Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, and were the great-grandparents of Adrian Lauw Zecha, founder of Aman Resorts.

Glass concerto.
"Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra" was commissioned from Philip Glass for Haas by the American Symphony Orchestra, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Peabody Symphony Orchestra, Phoenix Symphony and Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, jointly. Haas suggested the idea of a timpani concerto to Glass almost a decade earlier.
Haas performed the world premiere of the concerto on November 19, 2000 at Lincoln Center with Svetoslav Stoyanovby and the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Botstein.
He has performed national premieres of the work and recorded it in 2004 with Evelyn Glennie and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Gerard Schwarz as part of Glass' "Concerto Project". He has also performed versions arranged for chamber orchestra and for wind ensemble.
18th Century Concertos.
Haas is the soloist on all three pieces on the Sunset Records' CD "18th Century Concertos for Timpani and Orchestra":

BVG Class IK

The BVG Class IK is a type of electrical multiple unit used on the Berlin U-Bahn.
History.
In August 2011, BVG announced an order of "IK" series to replace A3L71 stock which had reached the end of its working life. Two prototypes were bought from Stadler Rail with the remaining 38 units being delivered between 2015 and 2017. These trains are based on the Stadler Tango family of trams and light rail vehicles, but resemble and function like a full-fledged subway train. The number '1xxx' will be jumped into '18Yxxx' (where Y is the train car number). Due to regenerative braking the trains will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require.
In 2012, BVG had awarded the tender for Class IK to Stadler Pankow, which replaces the life-expired A3L71 trains, which consists of 24 trains. It costs 158 million Euros. It has options for 10 more trains. In May 2015, BVG nicknamed the train "Icke". In September 2015, the first two trains were delivered - 1025 and 1026, into U1 and U2 respectively. In July 2016, BVG has plans to buy 27 more trains.
From July to December 2017, BVG has delivered 11 more trains under IK17. The trains are deployed to the bigger profile U5, which is due to shortage of trains. It is also called "Class I". The first train began running on 27 October 2017.
From April 2018, BVG had bought 27 more trains and delivered under IK18, which replaces A3L71.
In August 2017, U5 needs 20 more trains under IK20. This is because of various reasons as mentioned above. The Class D trains will be retired when the U55 extends to Alexanderplatz and this will be replaced by I-Class trains. With the delivery of the first IK20 unit 5065 on May 25, 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, the next delivery series of the IK series began, which again, like the IK17, will initially be in the large profile on the U5 line in order to have enough rolling stock for the planned end of 2020, to have a connection to Berlin Hauptbahnhof. The gap bridges known from the IK17 were installed accordingly. Significant differences to previous series are, for example, the new seat upholstery with the name "Urban Jungle", which is based on the well-known worm pattern from older BVG series and can already be found in new vehicles in the bus sector. Significantly fewer passenger information monitors were also installed in the passenger compartment. The numbering is also different here. Unlike its predecessors, the trains are included in the 5000 range. The reason for this is that in the small profile the numbers from 1070 to 1094 are still occupied by the GI / 1E series, which is in active passenger use, and are therefore no longer free for numbering. The plan is to classify trains in the 1000 range after the GI/1E series has been withdrawn.

Type 726 LCAC

The Type 726 LCAC (with NATO reporting name Yuyi class) is a class of air-cushioned landing craft used by the People's Liberation Army Navy. Six Yuyi-class LCACs are believed to be in service with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), with the first one (3320) being seen at the end of 2007. It is thought that the vessels were delivered in two batches, with the first three LCACs reportedly powered by Ukrainian UGT 6000 engines, while the remaining three are believed to use the indigenous QC-70 gas turbines. Up to four Yuyi-class LCACs can be carried in the well deck of the 210 m-long Yuzhao-class landing platform dock (LPD).
The Type 726 LCAC is greater in size than the US LCACs in service, but smaller than the Zubr-class LCAC and can carry only one main battle tank (e.g., Type 96) or four armored vehicles. 
The early variant, the Type 726, have encountered a number of technical problems that temporarily halted production of the class. This forced the four Type 071 LPDs to limit their projection capabilities to landing craft, amphibious IFVs and helicopters exclusively (not main battle tanks). However, recent commercial satellite imagery of China’s Jiangnan Shipyard near Shanghai shows that the country is producing additional Yuyi-class LCACs. Eight Type 726As that appeared to be nearly completed could be seen at the yard on 14 October 2020.
Eight Type 726s were seen at a Chinese at Damiao Naval Base on Nansan Island on 26 September 2020.

Amelia Scott

Amelia Scott (16 January 1860 – 25 March 1952) was a British social reformer and campaigner for women's suffrage. She was one of the first two women elected as Tunbridge Wells councillors.
Early life.
Amelia Scott was born in Byfleet, Surrey on 16 January 1860, the fourth child of Syms Scott and his wife, Ellen (née Nicholls). Her father was Clerk to the Lord Chamberlain of London and the family were reasonably prosperous, employing in 1861 three servants, a housemaid, nursemaid and cook. By then they had moved to Southborough, near Tunbridge Wells, where Amelia’s youngest sister, Louisa, was born in 1862. Syms Scott died while his children were still young and their mother later remarried. By 1881 Louisa and Amelia were living with an aunt and their grandmother, the three of them being attended to by a cook and three maids. Amelia Scott’s background was therefore comfortably middle class – her aunt and grandmother were described as ‘living on own means’ – although the family was not exactly wealthy. Her maternal grandmother was the widow of a clergyman and there is clear evidence of Amelia’s own religious belief and commitment.
After their grandmother’s death Amelia and Louisa Scott set up home together, living in several premises in the Tunbridge Wells area, before finally settling in Lansdowne Road where they lived with another sister, Florence. None of the woman married but they lived in respectable residences and could afford to employ one servant. Together with their siblings, they each inherited a share of their father’s estate and the sisters do not seem to have needed to take on paid work but budgets were necessarily tight as their income was limited.
Social work.
There is very little evidence of Amelia Scott’s initial education or of the first thirty or so years of her life, although she probably participated in conventional philanthropic, Church-related activities such as running mothers’ meetings and teaching Sunday school classes. She had a strong, Anglican faith and in 1898 her book, "Women of Sacred History", was published.
In 1894 Scott attended a conference of the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW) at Bristol. This event was an epiphany: ‘[i]n those days in Tunbridge Wells we lived in our own small, self-satisfied circles, both in religion, politics and class,’ she later recalled. ‘At Bristol I walked into a wholly different atmosphere, and it was an atmosphere where I would be’. Inspired by this conference, she formed an NUWW branch in Tunbridge Wells, holding the initial meeting in her own home and serving as its secretary for over thirty-five years. At the first meeting, the well-known workhouse reformer, Louisa Twining (who had retired to Tunbridge Wells) took the chair. Twining, who was a Poor Law Guardian (PLG) for the Tonbridge Union, must have encouraged Scott to follow in her footsteps, as in 1901 Amelia was elected a PLG. Scott also undertook social work training in London provided by the Charity Organisation Society (COS). In 1906 the Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch, under her direction, hosted the national NUWW conference in the town’s new Opera House. 
As a PLG Scott not only regularly inspected the workhouse premises at Pembury but also visited people for whom the Union was responsible including those who had been sent to the County Asylum at Barming, near Maidstone. She served on the Union’s Finance Committee as well as the Children’s Committee, the House Committee and the Mental Deficiency Committee. Her career as a PLG continued until 1930 when the Board’s functions were transferred to the Kent County Council’s Public Assistance Committee. According to a semi-autobiographical work about the ending of the Poor Law entitled "The Passing of a Great Dread", Scott learnt a great deal from her experience as a PLG, not least from her dealings with a female vagrant to whom she gave the pseudonym ‘Elspeth’. Her Poor Law work also opened her eyes to the needs of new mothers, both married, and unmarried; as well as those of young, sick and elderly workhouse inmates. Among the service improvements she championed was the construction of a proper mortuary, complete with space for the grieving relatives of the deceased.
Amelia Scott’s social activism focused primarily on the needs of young, working class women and mothers. Among her many local community projects was a hostel for working women, opened in Tunbridge Wells in 1913. Along with many NUWW activists, she had become concerned by the lack of housing provision for poor working class single women and children, other than mixed common lodging houses. The Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch raised funds to take over and refurbish a former inn and reopen it as the Crown Hostel for Women and Children. In 1931 it was reported to house 100 women and 50 children in a week.
Scott, together with her sister, Louisa and other local NUWW members also established a social club for working girls (particularly laundry workers) in Upper Grosvenor Road, Tunbridge Wells. Called the ‘Leisure Hour Club for Young Women in Business’, it opened its doors in 1900 and remained active for nearly twenty years. The club was supported by local philanthropists and ran excursions on bank holidays as well as holding club evenings. During the First World War it was joined by the ‘Comrades’ Club’, where young women were able to socialise with young soldiers, under the watchful eyes of the women volunteers.
Women’s suffrage.
Like many politically active women of her generation, Amelia Scott became an avowed supporter of women’s suffrage. In 1905 the Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch held a discussion on the subject of votes for women and Scott was among those who spoke up in favour. At the 1906 NUWW annual conference in Tunbridge Wells a memorable, heated debate on women’s suffrage took place, chaired by the national suffrage leader, Millicent Fawcett. 
From 1908 Scott was an official of Tunbridge Wells’ non-militant women’s suffrage society which was affiliated to the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), and which had a shop and offices in Crescent Road, Tunbridge Wells. Amelia Scott took part in peaceful demonstrations for women’s suffrage, once carrying a banner from the Thames Embankment in London to the Royal Albert Hall. In 1913 she became involved in the non-militant suffrage ‘pilgrimage’ to London organised by the newly formed Kentish Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies. She gave speeches en route, including at the Victoria Hall, Southborough. Her leaflet bag, emblazoned in the NUWSS colours of red and green, is now kept at the Women’s Library.
Scott supported suffrage because she believed that women should play a part in changing the law, especially with regard to morality. In other words, the vote was not for her an end in itself, but a means to an end. She told her audience at the Victoria Hall, ‘we women claim our right to political power in order that we may better carry it out.’ Furthermore, she expressed feminine solidarity: ‘the degradation of any woman is the degradation of all,’ she claimed. Scott’s feminism was thus rooted in her experience as a social activist as well as her religious faith. ‘Men and women TOGETHER form humanity’ she claimed, ‘in God our Creator there is neither male nor female... the distinction is purely physical, not spiritual.’
First World War.
During the First World War the Tunbridge Wells NUWW – still with Amelia Scott as its Hon Secretary – got involved in establishing voluntary women police patrols in the town and in running canteens for soldiers billeted in the area. In 1915 at the request of a military commander, Scott and her helpers opened a laundry service for washing and mending soldiers’ kits. At its height the laundry was dealing with up to 20,000 garments a week. Meanwhile, the former suffrage society offices were transformed into a depot for donations of clothing. After the war Amelia Scott attended a Buckingham Palace garden party for women war workers on account of the soldiers’ laundry which she had managed from 1915 to 1918.
Soon after the outbreak of war, as an influx of refugees from Belgium came to Britain, Amelia and Louisa Scott both became members of the Tunbridge Wells committee set up to welcome and assist the refugees. The Scott sisters and the other ladies on the committee must have been generous with their help for the refugees since in 1916 they were all presented with souvenir album autographed by members of the Belgian ‘colony’ in Tunbridge Wells. The album presented to Amelia and Louisa jointly as ‘Mesdemoiselles Scott’ is preserved in the Women’s Library in London. Amelia was also awarded the Golden Palm of the Order of the Crown of Belgium by the King of Belgium for her help to the refugees.
As well as the Armistice, 1918 saw the passage of the Representation of The People Act, which gave the parliamentary vote to some women. In December, these women got their first chance to vote in a general election and on polling day Amelia Scott took part in a procession of women through Tunbridge Wells to the Town Hall.
Post-war.
In 1918 the NUWW became the National Council of Women (NCW). Amelia Scott remained the local branch secretary and its members continued their active, local political campaigns. In addition, NCW women founded a Women’s Citizens’ Association, dedicated to the political education of newly enfranchised women. Amelia Scott was a leading member of this new organisation.
In 1919, Amelia Scott and her friend and colleague, Susan Power, became the first two women to be elected to the borough council of Royal Tunbridge Wells. Scott received almost 40 per cent of the votes cast in her ward. As a councillor she campaigned for the appointment of women police, for better housing and for the provision of municipal services such as a museum and library.
However Scott’s main local, post-war campaign was for a maternity home, together with a hostel and day nursery for the children of widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers. The project was intended as a thank offering for victory in the war. This was partially successful when in 1924 sufficient money had been raised to purchase two adjoining properties for the maternity home. By 1936 one-third of local mothers were delivered of their babies at the home and Scott was still a member of its committee when it was absorbed into the National Health Service in 1948.
National work.
Amelia Scott’s influence was not restricted to the local area. She regularly participated at NCW Annual Conferences and served on its national executive. She also established a national committee of the NCW, called the Public Service Committee, and was its secretary for 17 years. An early campaign of the committee’s was for safe lodging houses for women (see above). In 1919, when women were allowed to become Justices of the Peace (JPs) for the first time, the committee – previously just for women in local government – became the Public Service and Magistrates Committee (PSMC). Under its new name the committee - still convened by Scott - campaigned for better treatment of women in police cells and for the employment of women JPs in juvenile courts.
Amelia Scott corresponded with many of the leading figures of the NCW including Louise Creighton (founding president and wife of a Bishop of London) and she worked closely with Florence Ada Keynes on the PSMC. Her high-profile correspondents also included Beatrice Webb, Eleanor Rathbone MP, Millicent Fawcett (suffragist leader) and Clementine Churchill.
Amelia Scott’s national work showed the same interest in the care of vulnerable women and children as her local work. In 1918, together with other interested parties, the NCW established the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child (later the National Council for One Parent Families) and Amelia Scott was an early committee member. Unmarried mothers were, to say the least, a controversial cause in 1918, and her involvement reflects her care for those who were marginalised and stigmatised in society.
Retirement.
Around 1930 Amelia Scott retired from most of her public activities. That year Boards of Guardians were abolished and the following year she stepped down as branch NCW secretary. However, her retirement was only partial and by 1932 she was back in charge of a Tunbridge Wells soup kitchen, opened to help the rising numbers of unemployed. Moreover, she remained Chairman of the hospital committee at Pembury. She also retained her interest in the care of refugees: in 1939 she signed a letter on behalf of the Tunbridge Wells Refugee Relief Committee appealing for help for refugees from Nazi Germany.
In the 1940s Amelia Scott wrote a memoir focused on the transformation of the old workhouse into a modern, almost National Health Service hospital (called Passing of the Great Dread), which was eventually published in parts in the journal of the Family Welfare Association (formerly the COS). She was fond of handicrafts, including needlework and weaving, and she hand-knitted articles for the Seamen’s Mission. She retained her interest in the local hospital and its patients’ welfare: only weeks before her death she sent some Christmas flowers to one of the hospital wards.

Citizens Online

Citizens Online is a UK basic digital skills and digital inclusion charity that was founded in 2000 by Mark Adams and CEO John Fisher. Its aim is to ensure this switch to online doesn’t exclude people, and help to bridge the digital divide. The group works to help other organisations with the impacts of the switch to online services. The main service offered by Citizens Online is called Switch, which won "Best Digital Inclusion Product or Service" in the Digital Leaders Award for best product in 2015.
Fix the Web.
Fix the Web was Citizens Online's project to address digital accessibility issues for disabled people. The project won an award, was featured on the BBC and supported by Stephen Fry. An animation about the basics of web and software accessibility was launched on Global Accessibility Awareness Day in 2015, but the project failed to attract sufficient funding and is on hiatus.
With BT.
Corporations have played a role in the understanding and delivery of digital inclusion. Citizens Online have previously worked with and for BT Group Together, Citizens Online and BT supported research into the Social return on investment created by digital inclusion activity. BT’s Get IT Together programme was run by Citizens Online in communities in the UK. Citizens Online was also involved in delivering BT's Everybody Online initiative, which started in 2002. EverybodyOnline included delivering basic digital skills to groups within specific demographics, such as people affected by homelessness in Glasgow. Citizens Online also reviewed BT's computer giveaway programme Community Connections.
Research and lobbying.
Primarily, Citizens Online focus on delivery of projects, however the organisation has also lobbied the UK government for greater input and join up around the digital inclusion agenda, including a speech at the Institute for Public Policy Research. A white paper produced with Trapeze Transformation suggested that digital inclusion is a systemic issue needing system-wide solutions and laid the foundations for the Switch programme of work. Citizens Online have also done research for Government Departments and agencies such as Nidirect and BECTA.
Award schemes.
Citizens Online have run; the 'Innovation on the Community' award scheme with AOL, the Microsoft Community Learning Awards, TalkTalk Digital Hero Awards, and the European Commission.
One Digital.
Citizens Online are part of the One Digital partnership with Age UK, Clarion Housing Group, Digital Unite, and Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. One Digital is funded by the Big Lottery Fund.

 is a micro-asteroid and near-Earth object of the Apollo group on an eccentric orbit with has an estimated . It was first observed on 7 February 2018, by astronomers of the Mount Lemmon Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona, United States. The discovery occurred the day after its sub-lunar passage as it approached the Earth from a sunward direction, and this flyby altered the asteroid's orbit slightly. 
Orbit and classification.
 belongs to the Apollo asteroids, the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members, which cross the orbit of Earth.
Based on a high uncertainty, it orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.91–2.77 AU once every 2 years and 6 months (910 days; semi-major axis of 1.84 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.51 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 2.77 AU, it is also a Mars-crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins at Mount Lemmon with its first observation on 7 February 2018.
2018 flyby.
On 6 February 2018, 18:45 UTC, the day before its first observation, it had a flyby with the Earth at a nominal distance of 0.25 lunar distances (LD). Its next close approach to Earth is projected to occur on 23 January 2023, at . After the 2018-passage, the body's minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth increased to .
Physical characteristics.
The Minor Planet Center estimates a diameter of . Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion using an absolute magnitude of 28.036, the body measures between 7 and 14 meters in diameter for an assumed albedo of 0.057 and 0.20, which represent typical values for carbonaceous and stony asteroids, respectively.
As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
Numbering and naming.
This minor planet has not yet been numbered.

Carrickstone is an area of Cumbernauld, Scotland. It is on the north of the M80 and west of Cumbernauld Town Centre. The area it now occupies used to be covered by Carrickstone farm with the 25 inch Ordnance Survey map showing it between an ancient "standing stone" and The Village. 
Toponymy.
The historical etymology of Carrickstone's name is uncertain although it is now undoubtedly tied to the Roman altar.
History.
Carrickstone is named after the only Roman altar still in the open air in Scotland. John Watson in the New Statistical Account of Scotland described the stone long before the modern settlement took shape. The stone has also been linked with Robert Bruce, being the place where he reportedly set up his standard on his way to Bannockburn. There is a some evidence that coffins were laid on top of the stone on their way to the cemetery in Kirkintilloch and that the stone has been somewhat worn away. Several old documents show Carrickstone including maps by Charles Ross, and William Roy.

Samsung Galaxy J series

The Samsung Galaxy J series is a discontinued line (but continued in software update) entry-level Android mobile produced by the South Korean company Samsung Electronics, first introduced in 2015. This series is a part of Samsung Galaxy series, preceding the current Galaxy M Series and placed below the mid-range Galaxy A Series.
History.
Being mainly positioned low-end segments, all models in the series have the essential features of a standard entry-level smartphone, and differ in size and design. The letter J stands for "Joy" or "Junior". However, new features such as slow motion and video recording at any resolution above 1080p and any frame rates above 30 frames per second are left out entirely.
Other materials are used, with Samsung targeting Asian markets or the European entry-level market. The models are updated at least annually, minor updates or variants are displayed with name additions such as Pro, Prime, Max, etc.
Despite having a similar name, the original Galaxy J (SGH-N075/SC-02F), released in 2013, does not actually belong to the Galaxy J series as this phone was only available in few markets, and also positioned as a high-end smartphone based on the Samsung Galaxy S4.
In September 2018, there were rumors that Samsung will reorganize their smartphone lineup by discontinuing the Galaxy J series along with the online-exclusive Galaxy On in favor of extending the mid-range Galaxy A series to lower-end segment and introducing the Galaxy M series as the new online-exclusive series of smartphones to better compete against the increasingly popular Chinese manufacturers, such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi in the budget smartphone market. Samsung later introduced M10 and M20 in January 2019, followed by Galaxy A10, A30, and A50 the following month, and eventually announced that the Galaxy J series has officially merged into the Galaxy A series during the 2019 Galaxy A series launch event in April 2019 held in Thailand.
Successor.
The Galaxy J series was discontinued on 2019 in favor of extending the mid-range Galaxy A series into the entry-level segment, as well as introducing the online-exclusive Galaxy M series. The 2019 lineup also introduced Samsung's new naming scheme, with two-digit numbers as opposed to single digit of previous generation models.

Rama Rao, Krishna Kumari, Rajasree and music composed by Rajan–Nagendra. The film is based on the 1844 French novella "The Corsican Brothers", written by Alexandre Dumas. The film was dubbed into Tamil with the title "Veeraadhi Veeran" and released in the same year.
Plot.
Once upon on time a kingdom ruled by a king Mahendra, his younger brother Veerendra (Rajanala) hoped he would inherit the throne because his brother is childless. However, Veerendra is disappointed as Mahendra is blessed with twins in his late life. Since the infants are conjoined, it was thought they wouldn't survive. However, a British Doctor (Mukkamala) in the Royal employment came to the rescue and separated them by surgery. The boys are named Raja &amp; Madhav. On their naming ceremony day, Veerendra suddenly attacks and slaughters his brother &amp; sister-in-law and also tries to kill the twins. But the latter was hidden from his eyes by Veerayya (Chittor V Nagaiah), a personal servant of Mahendra and the doctor. Unable to find the kids, Veerendra sets the palace on fire assuming the children are still inside. Staring at the palace on fire, and with tearful eyes, Veerayya and Doctor vow to raise the twins into adulthood and secure them their royal throne. With a fear that the twins living together would raise suspicion, the Doctor keeps with him the elder boy Madhav. Veerayya takes Raja with him to rear him in the forest.
Years roll by, Raja &amp; Madhav (both N. T. Rama Rao) have a strange bond between them when Madhav undergoes a certain feeling, the other also is affected. Raja falls in love with a village belle called Roja (Rajasri), whereas Madhav imbibes modern habits and wins the heart of a girl called Malathi (Krishna Kumari). Veerendra's excesses know no bounds; he usurped the throne. One day, Raja angrily rushes into the royal court in its full session after knowing that Veerendra's soldiers had tormented the villagers. Raja beats Veerendra's henchmen to a pulp and frees his own men from the village. Veerendra was aghast wondering about the young man striking like thunder. Veerayya asks the doctor what should be done, out of his fear that Veerendra has seen Raja. It is time for the reunion of the brothers. They will have to make a claim for their rights. With these points in mind, Veerayya and the doctor introduced the siblings to each other in front of their parents’ cemeteries. They embrace each other while pledging to bring peace to the souls perished in the ashes of the palace fire. Raja rushes to the fort to kill Veerendra. As his efforts to appease Raja go in vain, Madhav runs after him who intervenes and requests his uncle to justly and peacefully surrender their kingdom. In the meantime, Vedanda (Satyanarayana), the right-hand of Veerendra throws a knife at Raja that fells him to the ground. Watching all this, Madhav turns wild and makes everyone helpless and retreats from the scene along with his brother.
Veerendra is left clueless how his brother's sons are alive. So, he sends Vedanda to find the twins’ whereabouts. Madhav and the doctor are just retreating after having dressed Raja's wounds. Vedanda happened to come there while he is in the hunt for the twins. Then, Madhav sees Vedanda and his followers insulting the modesty of lonesome Madhav. He thrashed and chased them away. The doctor happened to see them when they were fleeing. The doctor dutifully tends to their wounds. Veerendra gets suspicious after learning the above. He wondered what a doctor has anything to do with the forest. He thought that the doctor had something to do with some treason. He made a vain attempt to reach the doctor's home to find out the truth. But he forgets; he came there once and saw Malathi. She came there to see Madhav. Veerendra decides to marry, whatever the case. He comes to know that she is the daughter of Rangaraju, who is one among his staff. He goes to Rangaraju's house along with his soldiers. When Malathi declined his love proposal, Veerendra secured their house with his soldiers and kept them under house arrest. Madhav learned about this and goes there in disguise and releases them intact. Madhav takes Malathi to Veerayya to provide shelter. Veerendra finds out the foul play and sends his soldiers to get Malathi. Raja sees Malathi for the first time, he feels her as his dream girl and tries to advance with her. Veerayya scolds him and tells him that she is the fiancé of his brother Madhav. Raja starts hating himself, he goes to the doctor's house and asks him to give him poison. The Doctor interacts with him by telling the unique strange relation between the brothers and reminds him of their debt. Malathi is frightened on seeing Raja and flees. Vedenda captures her and takes her to Veerendra. Meanwhile, Madhav could not find Malathi, suspects his brother Raja and both start fighting. Roja comes and says that Malathi escaped. Madhav starts to rescue Malathi. Veerendra decides to marry Malathi, he also captivates the Doctor and Veerayya. Now Madhav enters the scene as a diamond merchant and gains the confidence of Veerendra. During the time of the marriage, Madhav snatches the wedding chain from Veerendra's hand and unties Malathi. Veerendra arrests him and starts beating him. Raja comes to his rescue and both of them stamp out Veerendra. The movie ends with the marriages of Madhav &amp; Malathi, and Raja &amp; Roja.

Van Veghten House

The Van Veghten House is a historic building in the Finderne section of Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. The house was built and served as the headquarters of Quartermaster General Nathanael Greene during the second Middlebrook encampment (1778–79) in the American Revolutionary War. The Somerset County Historical Society owns the house and uses it as its headquarters, including a museum and library. The early-18th-century Old York Road, connecting Philadelphia to New York City, passed by here. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1979, and noted as representing "one of the few remaining Raritan River mansions".
History.
In 1697, Michael Van Veghten (also spelled Van Vechten, 1663–1737) purchased 834 acres along the Raritan River near Finderne. After his first wife died, he then married Jannetje Dumont on April 2, 1691. Their son Derrick (also spelled Dirck, 1699–1781) inherited the property when Michael died in 1737.
During the second Middlebrook encampment, Derrick Van Veghten, a patriot of the American Revolution, gave Quartermaster General Nathanael Greene and his wife, Catharine Littlefield Greene, the use of the house for his headquarters and the farm for an encampment of his troops, without asking for any compensation.
On March 19, 1779, General Greene described an event attended by General George Washington that was held at the Van Veghten House in a letter to Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth: 
On August 30, 1781, the First Brigade of the French Army, the Expédition Particulière, under command of the French general Comte de Rochambeau, marched past this house, along the route to Yorktown, Virginia. The day's march was from the campground at Bullion's Tavern in Liberty Corner to the campground at Somerset Courthouse, now Millstone, New Jersey. The Second Brigade followed on August 31. The American Continental Army marched nearby along different roads as part of this joint effort.
After Derrick died in 1781, the estate passed to his son Michael Van Veghten (1764–1831).
Description.
The house is two and a half stories plus a cellar. Brownstone is used for the foundation, and the first story features Flemish bond brickwork on the south and west walls; otherwise common bond brickwork is used. Iron beam anchors, which are both functional and decorative, are visible on the south wall by the arches of brick voussoirs above the window heads. The house was renovated in the style of Greek Revival and features four mantelpieces of that style.

Snow washing

Snow washing refers to hiding illegitimate financial transactions often for purposes of tax evasion in Canada. The term is an amalgam of the words snow meaning purity as well as the cold Canadian climate and washing referring to money laundering. It is easy under Canadian law to set up a company, even for a fee as low as $200 (Canadian), while shielding the identities of the firm's real owners from the eyes of tax authorities. The global elite, as well as criminals and foreigners avoiding economic sanctions, can set up shell companies to "make suspect transactions seem legitimate" under the cover of Canada's reputation for fiscal integrity.
The registration systems for Canadian companies, at both the federal level and the provincial level, are shrouded in secrecy, which means that the real owner of a company or a trust can hire a person as a stand-in substitute to conduct all financial filings and submissions. The practice effectively makes Canada a tax haven along with countries such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama and the Bahamas. The process has been made even easier since the Canadian government has signed tax treaties with 115 countries. With a form of business organization called a "Canadian Limited Partnership", the only persons who have to declare themselves to the authorities are the partners, and if they do not live in Canada, they are exempt from filing taxes in Canada. For firms whose stocks are not traded publicly, the rules require that only the directors of such companies be identified, and these directors are not required to reveal whether they are acting on behalf of somebody else. There was a report in "The Economist" suggesting that the overheated market for private property in the Canadian city of Vancouver may be partially the result of purchases by unidentified persons, possibly foreign criminals and corrupt officials, as a way to launder dirty money. One estimate in 2009 by the national police was that C15billion was being laundered annually in Canada because of the opaque disclosure requirements.

Cecilia L. Ridgeway

Cecilia L. Ridgeway is an American sociologist and the Lucie Stern Professor of Social Sciences, Emerita in the Sociology Department at Stanford University. She is known for her research on gender and status processes, specifically on how large, societal-level gender and status inequalities are recreated in face-to-face interaction. Ridgeway served as president of the American Sociological Association in 2013. She also edited "Social Psychology Quarterly" from 2001 to 2003.
Education and career.
Ridgeway received her bachelor's degree with honors and distinction in sociology from the University of Michigan in 1967. She went on to receive her master's and PhD in sociology and social psychology from Cornell University in 1969 and 1972 respectively. She taught at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee from 1972 to 1985, attaining the rank of associate professor in 1978. She went on to teach at the University of Iowa from 1985 to 1991, and was instrumental in the development of their social psychology department. Her current position is at Stanford University.
Contributions.
Ridgeway's contributions to the field starts with her publications on status and expectation states theory. Ridgeway's research explored the emergence of social hierarchies through socially valid status symbols and nonverbal dominance cues. Ridgeway's most significant contribution to status research was her creation of and subsequent empirical tests of status construction theory. The theory argues that social differences between people can become treated as bases of status inequality when 1) resource inequality exists between people who differ on a social category (e.g., men and women) and 2) when members of the lower-resource category are less influential in social encounters than members of the high-resource group. When both occur, a person is likely to adopt status beliefs about members of these groups generally. Status beliefs refer to the conceptions of social value (e.g., perceived competence or honor) that are widely held about groups based on status markers such as sex or ethnicity. Ridgeway's work has been used to further research on inequality and the creation/perpetuation of inequality based on ones perceived status within society.
Ridgeway is also known for her work on gender, and how it operates as a source of status. Her book, "Framed by Gender: How Gender Inequality Persists in the Modern World", argues that gender is a fundamental social category that people use to relate to one another in social interaction. She argues gender stereotypes are so hard to change (and consequently gender inequality is so stable) because gender stereotypes are so frequently recreated and validated by other people in repeated face-to-face encounters.
Awards.
Ridgeway received the Cooley-Mead Award from the American Sociological Association in 2005 for her career contributions to social psychology. In 2009, Ridgeway received the Jessie Bernard Award for her work on gender inequality and her mentorship of younger, female academics. She won the Distinguished Feminist Lecturer Award from the Sociologists for Women in Society due to her feminist scholarship in 2008. In 2012, her book, "Framed by Gender: How Gender Inequality Persists in the Modern World", received the Outstanding Recent Contribution In Social Psychology Award from the Social Psychology Section of the American Sociological Association.

Furuseth, Ulrikke Hansen Døvigen, Isak Bakli Aglen, Maria Bock and Seda Witt. The film had its world premiere on 5 September 2018 in the main competition section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. and was released online and in select theaters on 10 October 2018, by Netflix.
Plot.
On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik dresses in a police uniform, loads a van with home-made explosives, and drives to Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter in Oslo, Norway. He leaves the van outside the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Moments later, it explodes, causing several casualties.
On the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, Buskerud, teenagers have arrived for Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, organised by the ruling Labour Party. When they learn of the bombing, one student, Viljar Hanssen, calls his parents to make sure they are unhurt.
Breivik arrives at the ferry landing and informs staff that he is a police officer, sent to secure the island following the attack in Oslo. The camp director transports him to the island by boat. Breivik instructs the staff to gather the children in one location. When the head of security asks for ID, Breivik shoots him and the director dead. The children flee as Breivik opens fire, murdering dozens.
Viljar and his brother Torje hide on a rocky embankment on the beach. Viljar calls his mother to tell her a shooting is in progress. Breivik finds the group and starts shooting. Viljar is shot multiple times, but Torje escapes unharmed. Breivik surrenders to a tactical team, and is brought inland for interrogation.
Breivik claims he is the leader of a white nationalist group called the Knights Templar and that more attacks will happen on his signal. He requests the aid of lawyer Geir Lippestad, who defended a Neo-Nazi. Lippestad is morally conscientious of his client and professionally bonded by his ethics as a lawyer. Lippestad tries to argue an insanity defense for Breivik, which draws criticism as it means he will be institutionalized instead of imprisoned. With the help of various psychiatrists and psychologists, Breivik is possibly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Breivik tells Lippestad he wants to be declared competent to legitimize his attacks.
Viljar wakes from a coma with life-changing injuries and returns home with his family. He learns to walk again, but is haunted by memories of the attack. With the support of his mother, and another survivor of the attack on Utøya, he appears in court as a witness and delivers an account of the massacre. Breivik is sentenced to 21 years, that can be extended by a court if it is deemed he is still a danger to society.
Production.

Greengrass revealed that he used Norwegian actors and crew for the film, because he considered that the film should be identified like a Norwegian film.

San Francesco, Montefalco

San Francesco is a gothic-style, former Roman Catholic church located in Montefalco, Province of Perugia, region of Umbria, Italy. The church and adjacent Franciscan convent now functions as the civic art museum.
The portal of the church dates to 1585. The church and adjacent convent were constructed between 1335 and 1338. The most notable works are the fresco cycles by Benozzo Gozzoli decorating the St. Girolamo Chapel and the apse; these include "Life of St. Francis" (1542). Jacopo Vincioli, Giovanni di Corraduccio and Ascensidonio Spacca also decorated the lateral chapels, and the site also includes an "Annunciation with God the Father in Glory between Angels and the Nativity" (1503) by Pietro Vannucci, known as “Il Perugino”.

Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act

The Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA or CPIA) is a United States Act of Congress that became federal law in 1983. The CCPIA implemented the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. It restricts the importation of some archaeological and ethnological materials into the United States from other State Parties to the Convention.
Provisions.
Import restrictions.
The CCPIA implemented Articles 7(b) and 9 of the UNESCO Convention. It delegates authority to impose import restrictions of archaeological and ethnological materials from other State Parties to the Convention. The CCPIA authorizes three types of restrictions:
Any cultural property that is imported into the United States in violation of the import restrictions is subject to seizure and forfeiture.
Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC).
The CCPIA also establishes the Cultural Property Advisory Committee. The Committee investigates each State Party's request, reporting its findings and making recommendations to the President. The President appoints the Committee's eleven members:
Legislative history.
1970 UNESCO Convention.
The United States Senate unanimously gave its advice and consent to ratify the 1970 UNESCO Convention on August 11, 1972. The Convention was a non-self-executing treaty.
Implementation attempts.
After ratifying the Convention in 1972, Congress proposed multiple bills to implement it.
One primary goal for the CCPIA was to maintain good foreign relations. The Senate Finance Committee acknowledged that the United States is a principal market for art and antiquities. The Committee believed that allowing stolen or valuable cultural property to be imported into the United States would damage relations with countries from which the archaeological and ethnological materials originated.
Another reason for the bill was the growing interest in Native American, Hawaiian, and Alaskan cultural property in the international art market. Through the CCPIA, the Committee wanted to encourage international cooperation to control the trafficking of these archaeological and ethnological objects.
The final version of the CCPIA was the result of negotiations and compromises between parties for and against the bill. Proponents of the legislation included art museums, archaeologists, and some academics; opponents of the bill included art and antiquities dealers, private collectors, and some academics.
In the 97th Congress, the CCPIA was first proposed as . On September 15, 1982, incorporated .
Amendments to the bill.
To accommodate private sector interests, the Senate Finance Committee amended the bill so that the United States could not establish import controls unilaterally. Instead, the President is required to obtain international cooperation and ensure that restricting importation is part of a concerted international effort.
Another amendment to the bill draft was related to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee. Previous versions of the statute had named the specific associations from which the President would be required to select his appointments. This limitation was removed, as the restriction was an infringement on the President's constitutional appointment powers.
The original draft of the bill allowed only judicial forfeiture proceedings. However, the Senate Finance Committee amended the bill to allow summary forfeiture proceedings as well. It believed that some cultural property subject to forfeiture under the CCPIA would be small in value and that neither the government nor the claimant would want to bear the cost of judicial proceedings.
Litigation.
Burden of proof.
In forfeiture cases under the CCPIA, the government bears the initial burden of proof of showing that the CCPIA applies to the contested objects. The government must demonstrate probable cause. Once the government meets this initial burden, claimant has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the object is not subject to forfeiture.
Cases.
"United States v. An Original Manuscript Dated November 19, 1778".
The government won a forfeiture case concerning a manuscript bearing the signature of Junipero Serra. The manuscript had been part of the Mexican National Archives and had been published in the Archive's microfilm records in 1993. In 1996, Claimant Dana Toft purchased the manuscript from a dealer in a hotel room and paid $16,000 in cash. When Toft consigned the manuscript to Sotheby's, the Mexican National Archives requested its return from Sotheby's.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that the United States provided sufficient evidence that the manuscript belonged to the Mexican National Archives and had been stolen after CCPIA went into effect. Thus, the court found the manuscript had been imported in violation of the CCPIA.
The court rejected Toft's innocent purchaser defense. Toft had not questioned the meeting with the dealing in the hotel room nor the exchange of $16,000 in cash, and the court found Toft had been willfully blind. The court also found that Toft was not owed compensation because Mexico showed that, in similar circumstances, it would recover and return an article stolen from a U.S. institution without requiring compensation.
"United States v. Eighteenth Century Peruvian Oil on Canvas Painting of Doble Trinidad".
The government won the forfeiture of two colonial-era Peruvian paintings. Claimant, a Bolivian citizen, imported the paintings into the United States in 2005, taking them to a gallery for restoration and consignment. Because the paintings had been crudely cut out from their frames, an art dealer suspected they had been stolen and contacted the FBI. The FBI seized the paintings. The government and claimant provided conflicting evidence: the FBI concluded the paintings came from Peru; claimant provided documentation that the paintings came from Bolivia.
The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia concluded that, either way, Claimant still needed to provide documentation authorizing import of the paintings because both Peru and Bolivia are State Parties to the UNESCO Convention and both have import restriction agreements with the United States. Because Claimant could not provide such documentation, the paintings were subject to forfeiture.
"United States v. Twenty-Nine Pre-Columbian &amp; Colonial Artifacts From Peru".
In 2010, United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized Pre-Columbian and Colonial textiles, metals, lithics, and perishable remains from Peru at Miami International Airport. Claimant moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and denial of due process of law.
First, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida found that the court did have subject matter jurisdiction. The court rejected Claimant's argument that the United States Court of International Trade had exclusive jurisdiction on the action.
Second, the court found that the United States sufficiently stated a claim by showing the imported objects were protected material under the CCPIA.
Third, the court rejected the claimant's argument that he was denied due process during CBP seizure proceedings because the CCPIA authorizes 90 days of artifact detention, and claimant did not protest the seizure despite notice and an opportunity to protest.
Ancient Coin Collectors Guild cases.
The Ancient Coin Collectors Guild purchased twenty-two coins from a numismatic dealer in London in April 2009. The collection included twelve Chinese coins and seven Cypriot coins. When the Guild attempted to import the coins later that month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized the property. Agreements with both China and Cyprus, under the CCPIA, were in effect at this time.
When the coins were seized, the Guild brought suit against various government departments, including the United States Department of State and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, challenging the legality of the CCPIA and its various provisions. After various appeals and remands, the courts rejected these challenges.
When the United States brought a civil forfeiture proceeding against the twenty-three coins, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland held that fifteen of the coins were subject to forfeiture. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.

Abbie Rowe

Abbie Alpheus Rowe (August 23, 1905 – April 17, 1967) was an American photographer, best known for being an official White House photographer from 1941 to 1967, covering five successive administrations.
Biography.
In 1930, Rowe was employed by the Federal Government with the Bureau of Public Roads, and in 1932, he joined the Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks (now known as the National Capital Parks and part of the National Park Service). It was in the latter job, that he took an interest in photography, when working as a policeman for the Roaches Run Waterfowl Sanctuary. His photographs of the birds led him to an apprenticeship to the NCP photographer, and he would be promoted as assistant photographer, and then senior photographer.
In December 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted a photographer to temporarily cover his official day-to-day duties (which could be seen as a precursor to the Chief Official White House Photographer). Coincidentally, one of Rowe's earliest photographs was of the First Lady riding horseback along the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway in the 1930s. Roosevelt was so impressed by Rowe's work, that he kept the Virginian on to document other official White House events. Rowe went on to photograph the presidencies of Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
In 1963, Rowe received the Distinguished Service Award of the Department of the Interior, and in 1966, Johnson gave him a commemorative medal for his 61st birthday. In April 1967, Rowe died of cancer, having been diagnosed two years earlier.

Thought Contagion

"Thought Contagion" is a song by English rock band Muse. It was released as the second single from the band's eighth studio album, "Simulation Theory", on 15 February 2018, following "Dig Down", released the previous year. The single debuted at number 76 on the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Chart.
Writing and recording.
"Thought Contagion" was released as a single and music video on 15 February 2018. Speaking to "Rolling Stone" magazine, Muse front man Matt Bellamy revealed that the song was written in late 2017, explaining that "I came up with the bass line and then I used a theremin, originally, to [create] this lead melody that went over the top." This melody was later changed, with Bellamy noting that "it occurred to me that the theremin melody would be a cool, anthemic sort of vocal part, so [bassist] Chris [Wolstenholme] and I did about ten passes on that to create this sort of crowd effect on the vocal".
Composition and lyrics.
In an interview with Beats 1 presenter Matt Wilkinson, Bellamy explained that the lyrics of "Thought Contagion" are based on the theory "that thoughts are contagious [and that] they spread like a virus, or like genes", noting that he had read about the idea in a book by Richard Dawkins. The singer has also admitted that the lyrical content of the song is likely influenced by "watching American news stations", detailing that "The verses are me streaming off anxieties and feelings, which ... I'm wondering whether they're actually mine or not". Musically, Bellamy has described "Thought Contagion" as "a pretty epic and anthemic track", pointing out its "arena sound and synths" as examples of the band's process of "getting into blending genres and eras together" for their upcoming eighth studio album.
Music video.
The music video for "Thought Contagion" was directed by Lance Drake, who also directed the band's previous video "Dig Down", and features "vampires who can manipulate lightning, neon-drenched streets, old arcade cabinets and a "Thriller"-type dance routine". "Billboard" writer Nina Braca also compared the video to Michael Jackson's "Thriller", describing it as "[an] intense '80s-inspired zombie love story", while "Spin" magazine's Andy Cush called it "an '80s-indebted video about sexy vampires and riot police".

T. L. Anthony

Thurston Lafayette "Mark" Anthony (April 11, 1896 – February 27, 1958) was an American football coach and player. He played college football as a lineman for the Georgia Bulldogs and was named to the 1921 College Football All-Southern Team. After graduating from Georgia, he held football and basketball coaching positions with several schools, including Statesboro Agricultural School, Powder Springs A&amp;M College, and Atlantic Christian College (later renamed Barton College).
Early years.
Anthony was born in 1896 and raised in High Shoals, Georgia. He was the son of John Wade Anthony (1862–1907) and Emma Collins Willard (1867–1946).
University of Georgia.
Anthony attended the University of Georgia, where was a star athlete in football, basketball and track. He played at the guard position for both the undefeated 1920 Georgia Bulldogs football team that has been recognized as a national champion and the 1921 team that won the 1921 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship. A sports writer in The Atlanta Constitution wrote in September 1921:
"[T]he scintillating star of the fracas was big Mark Anthony at guard. 'The noblest Roman of them all' was playing a brand of football hard to beat. He made practically half of the tackles and if there was a scrimmage in which he was not in, it escaped the vigilant and hawkeyed eyes of the press. Mark is the coming lineman of the south. He has the weight, speed, and fighting quality, and with a little more experience he will be the foremost guard in the south."
At the end of the season, Anthony was selected to the 1921 College Football All-Southern Team. He received both bachelor's and master's degrees at Georgia.
Coaching career.
After leaving the University of Georgia, Anthony coached at Statesboro Agricultural School, Powder Springs A&amp;M College, and Sale City High School in Sale City, Georgia. His Sale City basketball teams won two Georgia state championships.
In June 1928, he was hired as the head football and basketball coach at Atlantic Christian College—now known as Barton College–in Wilson, North Carolina. He remained in that post from 1928 to 1930. Atlantic Christian discontinued its intercollegiate football program at the end of the 1930 season.
Military service.
Anthony served in the United States Army during both World War I, enlisting in April 1918 and receiving his discharge in May 1919. During the war, he served in France with the 320th Field Artillery Regiment and achieved the rank of corporal. He served again during World War II from July 1942 to September 1944. He achieved the rank of first lieutenant during his second stint in the Army.
Family and later years.
Anthony was married in 1930 to Eunice Pauline Aycode. They had two sons, Claude (born 1936) and John (born 1938).
After his coaching tenure ended, Anthony returned to Georgia where he was employed for several years as a teacher. After World War II, he worked for the Veterans Administration. In 1950, he returned to Wilson, North Carolina, where worked in the insurance business. He remained a supporter of Atlantic Christian athletics and was chosen in 1958 as the president of the Century Club, a group supporting the school's athletic programs.
Anthony died on February 27, 1958, in an automobile accident in Wilson County, North Carolina. He was buried at Maplewood Cemetery in Wilson.

Ashley Blaker

Ashley Blaker is a British comedian and television producer. Blaker is a writer for TV and radio and a longtime collaborator with Matt Lucas: he was producer of "Little Britain" and "Rock Profile". He also co-created and wrote "The Matt Lucas Awards", and appeared in one episode. Lucas, amongst others, has described Blaker as "the UK's only Orthodox comedian".
As a stand-up comedian, Blaker’s first Off-Broadway show, "Strictly Unorthodox", opened in May 2017 at The Theater Center. and his second Off-Broadway show, "Goy Friendly" opened in February 2020, at the SoHo Playhouse.
Early life.
Blaker was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, where he was four years behind Sacha Baron Cohen, and a friend of Matt Lucas, with whom he went on to create "Little Britain". He is a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge. He embraced Orthodox Judaism in his early twenties.
Career.
As a producer.
Having completed a BBC course, Blaker had started work with them as a trainee radio producer. An unexpected encounter in the street in 1999 with his old school friend Lucas proved a turning point for them both. Lucas had pitched the idea of "Little Britain" to the controller of BBC 2, Jane Root. Blaker suggested turning it into a radio show and despite the initial reticence of Lucas' writing partner David Walliams, they decided to press ahead. The show launched in 2000, and Blaker produced two series on the radio before the show switched to TV in 2003.
With "Little Britain" under way, the same group collaborated on "Rock Profile". The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play and subsequent series appeared on BBC Two. 
From 2012-13, Blaker was producer, as well as co-creator and co-writer (with Matt Lucas) of The Matt Lucas Awards, a BBC TV show in which Blaker appeared on-screen in one episode.
As a comedian.
In 2017, he was commissioned by the BBC to create a show called "Ashley Blaker's Goyish Guide To Judaism", described as "an insider's view of his religion"". It was broadcast in June 2018 as part of BBC Radio Four's "Stand-Up Specials" series. A follow-up was commissioned and broadcast in 2019.
Blaker's stand-up show, "Observant Jew", was part of the 2018 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
In 2019, he performed a UK tour titled "Prophet Sharing" in tandem with Muslim comedian Imran Yusuf.
In August 2020, a new four-part series "6.5 Children" was commissioned from Blaker by BBC Radio 4; broadcast started in July 2021.
Critical reception.
His material has been described by the New York Times as being different from most other Jewish comics': "In contrast to most overtly Jewish comedy, which usually compares Jews and gentiles, most of his material juxtaposes the frum and not frum." The paper's review described him as "a skilled joke-teller with none of the borscht belt timing you would expect from a Catskills comic. And since we rarely hear the perspective of the ultra-Orthodox in comedy clubs, there’s a pleasing freshness about an act that offers a look into a world often hidden from public view."

During her time, Huber was president of Sociologists for Women in Society from 1972–1974, the Midwest Sociological Society from 1979–1980, and the American Sociological Association from 1988–1989. Being highly recognized for her excellence, in 1985 Huber was given the Jessie Bernard Award by the American Sociological Association. Not only was Huber an instructor of sociology at multiple institutions or president of different organization, she also served different editorial review boards, research committees, and counseled and directed many institutions on their sociology departments.
Life.
Early life.
Huber was born on October 17, 1925 in Bluffton, Ohio, to her mother, Hallie Althaus, and her father, Lawrence Huber, an entomologist. As a child, Huber lived in Wooster, Ohio, where her father worked at the Agricultural Experiment Station. Her scholarly influences were her father's education (Ph.D.) and The College of Wooster, a liberal arts college, located in the town. Huber graduated from Wooster High School in 1941.
Family.
Daughter of Hallie Althaus and Lawrence Huber, Joan's father was an entomologist and studied insects in Wooster, Ohio. Lawrence Huber worked at the Agricultural Experiment Station, which is now known as the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAFES). Joan's father also received his doctorate degree. Huber first married around 1945 to Tony Rytina, after she graduated from Penn State. In her first marriage she had two children, Nancy and Steve. Huber met her second husband in 1971 and both accepted jobs at the University of Illinois.
Education.
In 1945, Huber graduated from the Pennsylvania State University, where she earned and completed her bachelor's degree in German in less than two years. Following her graduation at the Pennsylvania State University, Huber then attended Western Michigan University, pursuing a master's degree. Ultimately receiving a master's in sociology in 1963, Huber then went on and furthered her education at Michigan State University and in 1967 she graduated and received her Ph.D.
Career.
Huber's work focused around gender stratification, which looks at the uneven dispersal of wealth, power, and privilege between the sexes and the absence of women in the political sphere. Huber first taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1967 to 1971, eventually moving to the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. While there, Huber served as the director of the Women's Studies Program for two years (1978–1980), becoming the head of the Department of Sociology in 1979 until 1983. In 1984, Huber moved to Ohio State University, where she became the dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, coordinating dean of the colleges of the Arts and Sciences, and senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost. Huber was president of Sociologists for Women in Society from 1972 to 1974, the Midwest Sociological Society from 1979 to 1980, and the American Sociological Association from 1988 to 1989. In 1985 Huber was given the Jessie Bernard Award by the American Sociological Association. Huber retired in 1993 after 48 years of research and education.
In 2007 Huber wrote "On the Origins of Gender Inequality". In her book, Huber discusses asymmetrical gender inequality and how it has perpetuated men's domination of human societies and women's subordination. Finding that important biodata from studies of sex and gender stratification has been excluded from sociology, Huber argues that it is critical to acknowledge biological sex differences to comprehend the small role that women have played in activities of more power and prestige.

Tom Palazzolo

Tom Palazzolo (born 1937) is an American experimental filmmaker, photographer, and painter. From St. Louis, Missouri, Palazzolo moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1960 to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Palazzolo is most known for his Chicago-centric documentary films. He is recognized for his ability to reveal the realities of the working class and urban life. Utilizing the Cinéma vérité style in films such as "Jerry's" (1976), his perspective often include panoramic views of a place or event. Palazzolo's editing style is said to add a sense of humor while still portraying his subjects honestly. He was an important part of the underground film scene in Chicago during the 1960-70s that set itself apart from the lights of Hollywood and New York City. 
Early life.
Tom Palazzolo was born in a working-class neighborhood in north Saint Louis, Missouri. His father was the son of Italian immigrants and his mother was third-generation Irish. Palazzolo is the oldest of his three siblings, Lynn, Bob and Janis. He attended an all-boys Catholic elementary school where he was recognized for his drawing abilities of his favourite characters. Evading his parents wish for him to attend an all-boys Catholic high school as well, Palazzolo managed to slip into the public Beaumont High School. His interest in drawing led to his submission in a Draw Me! contest and his enrollment in a mail-in Art Instruction Schools.
Education.
After graduating high school in 1957, Palazzolo worked at McDonnell Douglas plant for a year. During that time, he saved up money to attend art school. Off the recommendation of an old teacher, he enrolled in the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida. While at Ringling, he met Bernie Beckman, and the two studied commercial art together. Beckmann soon left for The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Palazzolo wanted to follow. He was rejected the first time but came back in person the next year and was accepted.
After moving in with Beckmann, he began to explore the city. He was intrigued by the grit of Chicago, its buildings, neighborhoods, businesses, attractions, and people. These interests would become a part of his painting practice to the disdain of his professors. After a slew of negative painting critiques, he signed up for a photography class taught by Kenneth Josephson in 1963. Josephson was the first professor to positively critique Palazzolo. Josephson also gave him his first filmmaking camera, the Keystone 16mm. Palazzolo's six years as a student wrapped up at his final critique where he presented his photography instead of paintings. So, his painting professors decided to give him a Bachelor and Master of Fine Arts in Photography.
Palazzolo is known for exhibiting with the group known as the Hairy Who or Chicago Imagists, a group of students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for transformed the city's art scene in the 60s with their bold, eclectic work and displays after graduation.
Professional life.
Underground film groups and independent filmmakers were coming onto the scene most notably in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Palazzolo was particularly inspired by artists D.A. Pennabaker and Ricky Leacock for shooting without a tripod as well as experimenting with the ideas of narrative. These were unconventional techniques of cinema verité moving away from the static and scripted west coast films. Palazzolo was among the group of artists in Chicago who helped pioneer the art of independent filmmaking.
In the mid 1960s, Palazzolo and a group of friends formed the Floating Cinematheque, a secret film society that met in apartments around Chicago. Many of the films by the Floating Cinematheque faced the chagrin of the Chicago Police Censor Board, which determined whether films should be censored or not. Once the Motion Picture Association of America adopted a rating system of films in 1968, local censorship watchdogs became a thing of the past and dispersed the attention for underground film groups like Floating Cinematheque.
During his time with the Floating Cinematheque, Palazzolo also regularly attended Monday night screenings at the Second City that were curated by exhibitors under the name Aardvark. Screenings at film festivals and Aardvark helped the promotion of Palazzolo's films. Roger Ebert was in attendance to many of the showings. He even reviewed some of Palazzolo's films such as Pigeon Lady about a neighborhood woman who fed the birds and Campaign, a film about the Democratic Convention of 1968. During the 1960s, Ebert was a well known supporter of Palazzolo's independent style and the two interviewed together with author and broadcaster Studs Terkel's WTTW talk show. 
In 1968, after gaining notable media attention for his documentary films, Palazzolo was invited by the United States Information Agency to tour the Middle East, Ceylon, India, and Turkey for three months to give talks and screen his films publicly. They chose Palazzolo, a so-called non-flamboyant Midwesterner but still from the notable city of Chicago to help inspire and promote independent filmmaking in those countries. Palazzolo also married long-term girlfriend Marcia Daehn in the same year in order for her to join him on the trip.
Palazzolo has taught film classes at Richard J. Daley College of the Chicago City Colleges from 1966-2002 and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1976-1990.
Palazzolo may be most well known for his film work, but he has continued his painting practice in shows such as "Tom Marches On! Four Decades of Paintings, Prints, and Photographs by Tom Palazzolo," in October 1999. "I always tried to knock out at least a few paintings a year, just to, um, keep my foot in, " said Palazzolo Palazzolo also continues his photography practice.
In July 2013, Palazzolo had a show called "The Tom Palazzolo Retrospective: Film, Photographs, Paintings, Watercolors &amp; Sculpture" at the Co-Prosperity Sphere in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood.
Palazzolo's book "Clark Street" was published in November 2019 with many of his original photos of Chicago from the 1960s and 1970s.
The Chicago Film Archives houses a large collection of Palazzolo's original films and subsequent copies.
Major works and collaborators.
Early notable films of Palazzolo's include "Love It / Leave It" (1973), a document of the Naked City Beauty Pageant in Roselawn, Indiana and a variety of midwestern parades. This film includes a political statement by juxtaposing scenes of nude pageant contestants with shots of police officers and quick cuts of clowns, illustrating Palazzolo's interest in political and social commentary. Often a participant or a close observer to the action, Palazzolo works to reveal absurdities he finds in midwestern norms and values.
Palazzolo approaches the subject of parades again in "Your Astronauts" (1970), in which he uses noise from a cafeteria as a soundtrack for the chaos of the Apollo 11 parade. Palazzolo found particular interest in the large number of suburban residents who had made their way into the city for occasions like these.
In 1972, Palazzolo met sixteen-year-old Jeff Kreines, a high school dropout from New Trier High School. He viewed one of Kreines' documentary films while judging a contest for student filmmakers at the Chicago Public Library. He admired Kreine's Cinéma vérité style, and the two made eight films together, with the most notable being "Pets on Parade" and "Ricky and Rocky". "Ricky and Rocky" follows Ricky, who is Italian, and Roxanne, who is Polish, through their surprise wedding shower thrown by Ricky's family. The camerawork in "Ricky and Rocky" emphasizes the family and their style, which is consequently more eventful than the wedding shower itself. The film won awards at the Ann Arbor Film Festival and the Bellevue Film Festival.
Kreines later introduced Palazzolo to Mark Rance, a classmate of his from New Trier. Palazzolo and Rance soon became collaborators as well. Their first collaboration was in 1975 about a naturist community in northern Indiana, titled "Sneakin 'n Peakin"'. Rance and Palazzolo's most well-known documentaries were "Marquette Park" and "Marquette Park II", which documented still-existing bands of Nazis protesting black families moving into Marquette Park in the mid-1970s. These films were shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and later at the Cannes Film Festival. Palazzolo and Rance's collaborations came to and end when Rance moved to Los Angeles.
During this time Palazzo worked on independent projects including "Jerry's," an inside look at the hectic nature of Jerry's Deli in Streeterville, "Gay for a Day," which chronicled a pride parade, and "I Was a Contestant at Mother's Wet T-shirt Contest," filmed at Mother's Bar and Club.
Other collaborators included Allen Ross, who helped found Chicago Filmmakers. In 1980, Ross and Palazzolo created "Nonna," a portrait of Palazzolo's Italian grandmother. By this time, the independent film industry was changing rapidly due to a rise in costs and the introduction of video. While many filmmakers switched to video, Palazzolo went on to create two more film works - this time narratives, titled "Caligari's Cure" (1982) and "Added Lessons" (1991).
Personal life.
Palazzolo married his wife Marcia Daehn in 1968. They had three children: Sarah, Amy, and Todd. Amy was featured in one of Palazzolo's short films in 2001 known as "Rita on the Ropes" which Jack Helbig helped write.

Franz (Ferenc, François) Kleinberger (8 June 1858 in Budapest - 10 June 1937 in Paris) was a European art dealer. He set up a gallery called F. Kleinberger Galleries at 9 Rue de l’Échelle in Paris, either in January, 1883, or on February 15, 1883, principally involved in selling to US buyers. The year 1848 appears too, but must be wrong, since he was born in 1858. Here is the source for the obviously wrong year of opening his gallery in Paris. By 1913, according another source after the First World War, he had set up a gallery on lower (first at No. 709, then at No. 725) Fifth Avenue in New York, near the Duveen Gallery. Harry S. Sperling took over as the firm's president after Kleinberger's death 1937.
He was the intermediary in the purchase of Fabritius's "The Goldfinch" by art collector Abraham Bredius for 6,200 francs at the sale of the Émile Martinet collection on 27 February 1896. "Ik liet Kleinburger op de veiling bieden... de heer zich om, en zegt: "nu zou ik well eens willen weten, wie de kooper is!" "C'est moi", luidde het antwoord." ["I let Kleinburger bid at the auction ... the gentleman turned around and said, "now I would like to know who the buyer is!" "C'est moi" was the answer".]

Henry Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury

Henry Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury (died 19 April 1738), of Ribbesford, Worcestershire, was an English Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1708 until 1709 when he succeeded to the peerage as Baron Herbert of Chirbury. 
Herbert was born after 1678, the only son of Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury and his wife Anne Ramsey, daughter of John Ramsey, Dyer, of London. He was educated at Westminster School in 1695 and then privately under Abel Boyer in 1699. 
Herbert stood for Parliament at Bewdley at the 1705 English general election but was defeated in the poll and was then unsuccessful with a petition. His father, a staunch Whig, then procured a new charter for Bewdley and was able to take control of the borough. Herbert junior was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Bewdley at the 1708 British general election. His father died on 22 January 1709 and Herbert succeeded to the peerage. Consequently he vacated his seat in the House of Commons to sit in the House of Lords. There he continued to challenge a petition against his election in order to secure the new charter. 
Lord Herbert married Mary Wallop, daughter of John Wallop of Farley Wallop, Hampshire, on 12 December 1709. She was the sister of John Wallop, 1st Earl of Portsmouth. Herbert's election expenses had helped bring him into financial difficulties. By 1713 he was serving the Tory ministry of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, who personally funded Herbert so he could stay in London and vote. When the Whigs were in control after 1714, Herbert reverted to his original allegiance in the hope of securing financial aid. He died without issue on 19 April 1738, allegedly by suicide. His widow died in 1770.

Cynthia Fuchs Epstein

Cynthia Fuchs Epstein is an American sociologist and emeritus distinguished professor of sociology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Fuchs Epstein served as president of the American Sociological Association in 2006.
Professional.
At Columbia University, Fuchs Epstein was able to study the changing American family after receiving a grant of $1,000 from the Institute of Life Insurance. Her study showed that women were beginning to enter the workforce at higher rates than they previously had, but there still weren't many jobs considered appropriate for women. This locked women out of prestigious professions and prevented upward mobility.
Fuchs Epstein's dissertation analyzed the various factors that affected whether or not women were excluded or included in the professional realm, focusing on female lawyers as a deviant case because they were rare. She decided to study a sample of women lawyers who found a way around the prevalent gender discrimination.
In 1966, she joined a number of other women who were in academics or other professional positions to form the National Organization for Women in New York City. She also actively participated in professional women's groups such as Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS) and the Professional Women's Caucus.
Fuchs Epstein participated in various hearings on gender discrimination as a scholar and activist, testifying at the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) where she spoke about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the barriers women faced in the professional world at the time. Fuchs Epstein was a consultant to the White House under two administrations, one of which being President Ford's, to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and General Motors. She also served at the National Academy of Sciences on the Committee of Women's Employment. She conducted research that focused on the segregation based on gender and race at AT&amp;T. Furthermore, she served as an expert witness on the Citadel case where she argued women in this military school should be included.
Fuchs Epstein's first book was published in 1971 and was titled "Women's Place: Option and Limits on Professional Careers". In it she focused on women's professional advancement as framed by the “opportunities offered them, the organizational limits placed on their ambitions, and the recognition and reward of their accomplishments.” Specifically, she incorporated gender into a discussion of social structures and status. Her work "made a crucial connection between traditional sociology and the emerging field of women's studies." Her second book was published in 1981 and was titled "Women in Law". In this work she provided empirical evidence that illuminated how these processes affected the careers of female lawyers.
In 1981 Fuchs Epstein received the Merit Award of the American Bar Association for Women in Law as well as the SCRIBE's Book Award.
For her first study after completing her graduate education, she studied specifically Black female professionals whom she interviewed about the various factors that made it possible for them to achieve their positions despite the discrimination they faced for their gender and skin color. Out of this study came an article titled "Positive Effects of the Multiple Negative: Explaining the Success of Black Professional Women", which the American Journal of Sociology published in 1973 and explained that employers were willing to hire African-American women because they could look good for hiring them but not have to hire both a woman and an African-American person. Fuchs Epstein uncovered that the thought behind hiring these women was essentially killing two birds with one stone to as artificially as possible satisfy the demand for opportunities for women and African-Americans.
Fuchs Epstein's interest in women's professional lives led her to “explore the dynamics of stereotyping in all spheres of society,” focusing on how boundaries are socially constructed. Out of this came the book Deceptive Distinctions, which was published in 1988.
In the 1990s, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York's Committee on the Status of Women invited Fuchs Epstein to research why women's professional careers often ended mid-stream. She conducted a study of the professional mobility of women in several corporate law firms. From this research emerged the concept of the “glass ceiling,” which is essentially women never attaining the highest status in their careers. In 1993 Women in Law was reissued with a new section discussing the glass ceiling effect in the legal profession.
Fuchs Epstein was invited to meet with Hirsh Cohen, vice-president of the Alfred Sloan Foundation, in 1994. She conducted research that discovered that a very small percentage of lawyers (less than three percent) chose to work part-time because this caused others to perceive them as less committed to their professional life and ultimately resulted in them not being given very meaningful work. This research informed her next book, titled "The Part-time Paradox: Time Norms, Professional Life, Family and Gender", published in 1999.
She produced a paper titled "Border Crossings: The Constraints of Time Norms in Transgressions of Gender and Professional Roles," published in 2004, that examines how doing something professionally, which goes against the expectations for women, is prevented by time norms which create priorities in certain categories for people. It looks at the ways in which ideologies of time, such as the idea that professions are greedy institutions, as well as gender ideologies, like the concept that women should take care of the family, restrict social change.
Fuchs Epstein is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center and has been since 1990. She is a past president of the American Sociological Association. She has been a visiting professor or scholar at the Russel Sage Foundation, the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and the Stanford and Columbia Law Schools, among many other places. She was chair of the ASA Occupations and Organizations, Culture, and Sex and Gender Sections and president of the Eastern Sociological Society. She was also a Guggenheim Fellow.
Among the many professional awards she has received are the ESS Merit Award, the ASA Jessie Bernard Award, and the first Sex and Gender Section award for distinguished contribution to gender scholarship.

Peter Kuttner

Peter Kuttner is a Chicago filmmaker, activist, and cameraman. He is known for his early socially-conscious documentary films that touch on topics such as opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, gentrification of Chicago, racism, and social class. He produced many of these with the film collective Kartemquin Films, of which he was an original member. He is best known for his work on the film The End of the Nightstick (1993) with Cindi Moran and Eric Scholl, which documented police brutality in Chicago and torture allegations against commander Jon Burge. Kuttner has worked extensively in activism and community service, and was a founding member of activist group Rising Up Angry. Kuttner has worked with many collaborators including Kartemquin Collective founder Gordon Quinn, and filmmakers Haskell Wexler and Robert Kramer. He is also known for camera work on a number of major motion pictures including "Man of Steel" and "Source Code".
Early career.
Kuttner grew up in a middle-class neighborhood and attended public school near Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. He attended college at Northwestern University, where he created the film "Cause Without a Rebel" (1965), a short documentary film about student political complacency on the Northwestern Campus. Kuttner graduated from Northwestern that same year in 1965.
After graduation, Kuttner joined the War On Poverty Pre-College Film Workshop program. During this time he taught and collaborated with African-American students from Dillard University in New Orleans on the films "Tackle is a Girl’s Best Friend" (1965) and "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (1965).
In 1966 Kuttner was hired as a director at Chicago Television Station WTTW (Window to the World), a station that would eventually be owned by PBS. It was here that a visiting crew introduced Kuttner to the Cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking. There he made a small number of shows including the arts series "Facets".
Newsreel.
After leaving WTTW in the fall of 1967, Kuttner became interested in political activism and eventually reconnected with some Canadian Cinéma vérité filmmakers he had worked with before, who were filming a piece about Norman Mailer out of the Toronto offices of Allan King. During his stay in New York, Kuttner met Melvin Margolis at a film screening, who then introduced him to Newsreel, a New York-based documentary film group whose subjects included the Anti-war movement, the Black Power movement, and the Women's liberation movement. The group had connections to anti-war protestors David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden, who would eventually be named as part of the Chicago Seven conspiracy.
Kuttner opened a Chicago chapter of the group, recruiting 15 members, including Jon Jost, and established ties with local film collectives like Kartemquin and The Film Group. The Chicago branch functioned mostly as a distributor for the New York Headquarters. The branch released one film under the name “Chicago Film Co-op”, "April 27" (1986), which documented the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests and police response. They also started production on two other films that were later damaged in a fire. One of the films, a documentary about the Black Panther Party's Illinois chapter's involvement in the Free Breakfast for Children program, was lost completely. The other was the film "Trick Bag," which Kuttner would eventually restore during his time at Kartemquin.
Activism and community service.
Kuttner was a founding member of the Chicago New Left activist group Rise Up Angry, where he took a break from filmmaking. There, he wrote film reviews for the organization’s newspaper and helped organize their citywide free clinic. They worked alongside the Peace movement, Black Power movement, and Women's liberation movement.
Kuttner also spent time working with Upward Bound, a college prep program for students from disadvantaged areas. He also worked on the boards of the Community TV Network and Community Film Workshop, both established media programs for Chicago youth.
Kartemquin.
Kuttner started working with Kartemquin in 1968, and joined officially in 1972 after he got a call from Gordon Quinn. At Kartemquin, his films covered topics ranging from gentrification to funding cuts of home-birth organizations. During his time there he worked on the films "Hum 255", "Trick Bag", and "Now We Live on Clifton," and the "Chicago Maternity Center Story" (1976).
Trick Bag.
Trick Bag was a collaboration between Kartemquin, Columbia College Chicago, and Rise Up Angry. Peter Kuttner's connection to Rise Up Angry sparked the creation of the film, as it was originally a Newsreel project that had been left unfinished when the group dissolved. The film negatives were destroyed in a fire, but Kuttner helped restore it from the work print when he joined Kartemquin in 1972. The film features various conversations and interviews with youth, workers, and veterans around Chicago talking about race and class. Trick Bag went on to earn the Chicago International Film Festival "Merit Award".
The End of the Nightstick.
In 1994 Kuttner collaborated with Chicago Torture Justice, an organization dealing with the aftermath and recovery of brutality experienced at the hands of police officers like Jon Burge. Kuttner produced "The End of the Nightstick" (1994), a PBS P.O.V. broadcast, with Cyndi Moran and Eric Scholl. The film received a Silver Hugo from the Chicago International Film Festival in 1994.
Later career.
In 2017 Kuttner worked as an instructor to Community TV Network students, who created a film featuring the south side of Chicago community center. The short film, "Welcome to the Peace House," went on to win the CHICAGO Award by the Chicago International Film Festival’s CineYouth Festival. Kuttner has continued his work as a political activist through local activist groups and as a member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Union, and as a board member of South Side Projections.
Commercial filmmaking.
Kuttner has contributed to a number of commercial productions in Chicago as a camera assistant. Some of these include "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), "The Dark Knight" (2008), "Source Code" (2011), ' (2011), "Formosa Betrayed" (2009), and the U.S. version of TV series "Shameless". Others that were filmed in and around Chicago were "Man of Steel" (2013), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (2003), "Proof" (2005), The Break-Up (2006), "Eagle Eye" (2008), "Traitor" (2008), ' (2004), and "Mad Dog and Glory" (1993).

Chulmleigh (horse)

Chulmleigh (1934 – after 1957) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed little ability in his early career and finished no better than third in his first four races before winning a minor race at Chepstow Racecourse in the summer of his three-year-old season. After a promising second at York in August he recorded a major upset by winning the St Leger Stakes. He was retired soon afterwards and stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and Argentina. He had little success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Chulmleigh was a "massive" bay horse standing 16.3 hands high bred in England by William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely who also owned him during his racing career. The horse had an unusual facial marking in the form of an abbreviated white blaze which began half-way down his face and ran down to his nose. He was sent into training with Lord Glanely's private trainer Thomas Hogg at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Both of Chulmleigh's parents were Classic winners who had been owned by Lord Glanely and trained by Hogg. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Singapore, who won the St Leger in 1930, while his dam, Rose of England took the Oaks Stakes in the same year. Singapore was not a great success as a breeding stallion and was eventually exported to Brazil. Rose of England produced several other good horses including the July Stakes winner British Empire.
Racing career.
1936: two-year-old season.
Chulmleigh ran three times as two-year-old in 1936, producing his only placed effort on his debut when running third in the Whitsuntide Plate at Manchester Racecourse in June. Later that month he was sent to Royal Ascot for the Chesham Stakes but came home unplaced behind Lord Derby's colt Fair Copy, who won the Middle Park Stakes later that year. He returned after a break for the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse in autumn but finished unplaced.
1937: three-year-old season.
Chulmleigh did not compete as a three-year-old until July and then made no impact in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse as he finished unplaced at odds of 20/1. The colt eventually won a race at the fifth attempt when he defeated moderate opposition to take the Summer Stakes at Chepstow. At York Racecourse in August, Chulmleigh showed high-class form for the first time as he produced a strong late run and finished a close second to the gelding Mange Tout in the Great Yorkshire Stakes.
On 8 September Chulmleigh was moved into the highest class to contest the 162nd running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Before the race he was described as having "nothing to his credit" as a contender. Ridden by Gordon Richards, who only took the ride when his intended mount was withdrawn, he started an 18/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field headed by the Epsom Derby winner Mid-day Sun. After taking an early lead, he settled behind the leaders as Maranta set the pace from a closely bunched field. Many horse were still in close contention a furlong out at which point Fair Copy went to the front and looked the likely winner. Chulmleigh, however, produced a strong late run to overtake Fair Copy inside the last 50 yards and won by half a length in what was described as a "sensational finish". Mid-Day Sun, who had been repeatedly hampered, was three-quarters of a length away in third.
Chulmleigh was expected to reappear in the Jockey Club Stakes but never ran again and was retired to stud at the end of the 1938 season.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Chulmleigh a "poor" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Chulmleigh stood as a stallion in England but attracted little interest from breeders. The best of his offspring was probably Whiteway, who won the Yorkshire Cup and the Cesarewitch. He also sired the mare Sweet and Rough who produced the Goodwood Cup winner Tenterhooks. In 1945 he was sold and exported to Argentina where his last reported foals were born in 1958.

Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas

The Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas ("fl". between 1500 and 1525) is the notname given to a Flemish painter who likely worked in Bruges in the first quarter of the 16th century. He produced devotional pictures in a style reminiscent of contemporary painters working in Bruges such as Gerard David and Ambrosius Benson.
Identification of the oeuvre.
In an article published in 2000, the Belgian art historian Didier Martens grouped eight paintings together under the notname Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas. The key work around which he built the identification was the (at that time in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum and since auctioned by Christie's on 29 January 2014, New York, lot 105). On stylistic grounds Didier Martens attributed the works to an anonymous painter believed to have been active in Bruges during the first half of the 16th century. All of the works contain female figures which are characterised by their rounded, full faces. It is this key feature that gave rise to the naming of the artist as the 'Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas'. In particular, the faces of the female figures in these works show a strong resemblance to each other: the forehead is high and clear, the eyes are half-closed, the eyelids are fat, the eyebrows are fine and curved, the nose ends on a straight edge and the nostrils are narrow. Stylistically the paintings are close to the mature work of other Bruges painters such as Gerard David and Ambrosius Benson.
Whereas the artist was likely active in Bruges as is evidenced by the clear influence of the Bruges style on his work it does not necessarily mean that he was a native of Bruges.
Works.
About a dozen works are now attributed to the Master. The subject matter of the works attributed to the Master are devotional in nature and most of them depict scenes with the Virgin and Child, the Holy family and the so-called sacra conversazione, i.e. the Virgin and Child amidst a group of saints in a relatively informal grouping. A few portraits by his hand have also been preserved. These works likely portrayed the donors who had paid for the devotional work of which the portraits had formed the pendants.
Selected works.
The works attributed to the Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas include:

Johann Jakob Fugger

Johann Jakob Fugger or Hans Jakob Fugger (23 December 1516, Augsburg - 14 July 1575, Munich) was a German banker and patron of the arts and sciences from the "von der Lilie" ("of the Lily") line of the noted Fugger banking family.
Life.
He was the son of Raymund Fugger (1489–1535) and his wife Katharina (1488–1535), daughter of János Thurzó, owner of a mining company. Johann Jakob inherited the business from his father's brother Anton Fugger in 1560 but did not prove so fortunate in his business dealings - the family had lent money to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, landing them in deep trouble when Spain went bankrupt. Johann Jakob had to sell off his whole collection (except his library) to improve matters and handed the business over to his cousin Marcus (1529–1597), who was able to consolidate it. In 1565 he entered Albert V's service and later became president of his privy chamber.
On Titian's advice, Johann Jakob brought Titian's pupil Antonio Ponzano to Augsburg to paint frescoes in the inner courtyard of the Fuggerhäuser - frescoes had already been painted on the building's inner courtyard and outer wall by Hans Burckmair the Younger (1500–1562) and Albrecht Altdorfer. Jacopo Strada also acted as Johann Jakob's art agent in Italy. He was in correspondence with cardinal de Grandvelle - one of his letters to him was included in Pelisson's "Traité de la Tolérance des religions" ("Treatise on Tolerance of religions"). He also had a major library and tried to convince Hieronymus Wolf to become its librarian. In 1571 he sold it to Albert V, making it the nucleus of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.
Johann Jakob is also thought to be the author of the two folio-volume "Wahrhaftigen Beschreibung des österreichischen und habsburgischen Rahmens, Herkommens, Geschlechte, Fortpflanzung" ("True Description of the Austrian and Habsburg Houses..."), written in German, with over 30,000 coats of arms, seals, portraits and other images. Copies of it survive in libraries in Vienna and Dresden, Lambécius and Rollar published fragments from it and Sigismond de Birken published an extract under the title "Spiegel der Ehren des höchstlöblichen Kayser- und Königlichen Ertzhauses Oesterreich" ("Mirror of the Lords of the most high Imperial and Kingly House of Austria").
Marriage and issue.
He married twice:

A22 (antibiotic)

A22, also known as "S"-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl) isothiourea, is a chemical compound with antibiotic activity. It is colorless, hygroscopic, and light-sensitive.
Antibiotic activity.
A22 acts as a reversible inhibitor of the bacterial cell wall protein MreB, causing bacterial rod-shaped cells to form coccoid cells. The antibiotic activity of A22 has been studied primarily in "Pseudomonas aeruginosa." However, A22 does not seem to be useful as an antibiotic in humans due to its cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
A22 as a research tool.
Despite its cytotoxic effects in human cells, A22 has been used as a research tool to investigate the bacterial cytoskeleton. A22 binds directly to the actin homolog MreB in its nucleotide-binding pocket, blocking simultaneous ATP binding. As a consequence, A22 inhibits MreB polymerization and thus disrupts the cytoskeleton of bacteria, causing defects of morphology and chromosome segregation.

Antonio Ponzano

Antonio Ponzano, Ponzoni or Bonzone (died 1602, Munich) was an Italian Mannerist painter active in the 16th century.
His birthplace is unknown - it may have been Venice, since he was influenced by the Venetian style. He was a studio assistant to Giulio Licinio in 1565 at the court of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Between 1550 and 1600 a large number of Italian painters moved to the Wittelsbach ducal court. Major banking families such as the Fuggers were also major art patrons - Ponzano himself was an assistant to Friedrich Sustris between 1569 and 1573 in Augsburg, where Sustris was working for Hans Fugger. Between 1585 and 1597 Ponzano was at the court in Munich.
Some of Ponzano's 1570-1572 paintings with 'grottesche' survive in the Fugger palace in Augsburg, as well as some of his studio work for Sustris. He also assisted Sustris and Alessandro Scalzi (known as "Il Paduano") on their 1580 work at Trausnitz Castle at Landshut - there Ponzano worked on the lodges in the castle, creating scenes of mythological love affairs. Sustris designed the "Grottenhof" at the Munich Residenz, with the shells and grotesques painted by Ponzano and the Dutchman Pieter de Witte.

1962–63 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team

The 1962–63 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1962–63 NCAA University Division men's basketball season. The independent Vandals were led by third-year head coach Joe Cipriano, and played their home games on campus at the Memorial Gymnasium, in Moscow, Idaho.
In his only season with the Vandals, forward/center Gus Johnson was a Northwest sensation, and led the team to a record. Under the NCAA rules of the era, junior college transfers that had previously attended a four-year college were not allowed to play in tournaments during their first season at the new (third) At the Far West Classic in Portland in late December, Idaho lost two of three games without him. With Johnson on the floor, the team was entering the final weekend, but dropped two in Seattle.
Led by leading scorer Chuck White and Johnson, the Vandals were at their best in their main rivalries from the old Pacific Coast Conference: versus Oregon, versus Palouse neighbor Washington State, and against Washington. The primary nemesis was Seattle University, led by guard Eddie Miles, who swept all three games, half of UI's losses. Idaho dropped its only game with Oregon State at the Far West without Johnson, but won all three with Gonzaga, for a record against its four former PCC foes and a collective against the six Northwest rivals. In the last season before the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals were undefeated in ten games against those teams; this included a sweep of Idaho State for the King Spud Trophy and unofficial state title.
Attendance at the Memorial Gym was consistently over-capacity, with an estimated 3,800 for home games in the cramped of WSU on December 20 caused the region to take The teams met nine days later in Portland without Johnson, and Idaho had to rally from behind to win by Johnson and center Paul Silas of Creighton waged a season-long battle to lead the NCAA in rebounding. Silas claimed this by averaging 20.6 per game, 0.3 more than In February, a low-profile article in "Sports Illustrated" introduced the team to the nation.
Despite their record, the Vandals were not invited to the post-season. The NCAA tournament included only 25 teams and Oregon State and Seattle U. were selected from the Northwest. The NIT invited just twelve teams, with none from the Mountain or Pacific time zones. If Idaho had been invited, Johnson was ineligible to participate.
Aftermath.
That spring, 24-year-old Johnson was the tenth overall selection in the 1963 NBA draft and went on to a hall of fame career with the Baltimore Bullets. Cipriano also moved on to coach at Nebraska for seventeen until his death. Without Johnson (and White), the Vandals fell to in and were in the new Big Sky Conference, fifth place in the six-team league. They had a dismal record through and lost every game against their Northwest rivals, a collective vs UW, WSU, UO, OSU, Seattle U., and Gonzaga.
High scorer White became a hall of fame high school head coach in Anchorage, Alaska; but both Cipriano and Johnson died before age fifty, due to Team captain Lyle Parks earned a degree in chemical engineering, and sophomore Chuck Kozak graduated from the UI's law school

It was created in 1875 as a merger of Vaumarcus and Vernéaz, and was called "Vaumarcus-Vernéaz" until 1966.
Montalchez.
Montalchez is first mentioned in 1340 as "villa de Montallichie".
Geography.
After the merger, La Grande Béroche has an area, , of .
It was part of the district of Boudry until the district level was eliminated on 1 January 2018.
Demographics.
The new municipality has a population () of .
Historic Population.
The historical population is given in the following chart:
Heritage sites of national significance.
The prehistoric lake shore settlement at Baie De Bevaix, the neolithic funerary and cultural center of Treytel-A Sugiez in Bevaix, Gorgier Castle, the Gallo-Roman settlement at La Béroche and a prehistoric lake shore settlement in Gorgier, La Béroche, a Gallo-Roman settlement, and the neolithic settlement at Port Conty / Tivoli in Saint-Aubin-Sauges, the La Redoute Des Bourguignons, a prehistoric site and hallstatt tumulus in Vaumarcus are all listed as Swiss heritage site of national significance.
World heritage site.
The new municipality is home to three prehistoric sites which are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps UNESCO World Heritage Site. Bevaix is home to the L’Abbaye 2 site, Gorgier has the Les Argilliez site and Saint-Aubin-Sauges has the Port-Conty site each of which is a prehistoric pile-dwelling (or stilt house) settlement.
L'Abbaye 2 is a Bronze Age submerged site located near the L'Abbaye 1 Neolithic site. The former village at L'Abbaye 2 is about from the lake shore and consisted of a number of stilt houses. It has been dendrochronologically dated to 1040-986 BC. The village site covers an area of about and was probably connected to the shore by a foot bridge. About 400 Bronze Age objects have been discovered in the water around the village.
The Les Argilliez site consists of two villages. One is a Classical Cortaillod village with 6 piles dated between 3841 and 3817 BC. The other is a Late Cortaillod site with 2 piles from 3531 to 3528 BC. Both villages are in a small bay about north of the Chez-le-Bart 1 site. The remains of the villages are still quite visible underwater and stretch over an area of about . Some stone axes, antler ax handles and pottery fragments have been discovered.
Port-Conty has two neolithic settlements. The first is a Late Cortaillod or Port-Conty type Cortaillod village. One piece of timber from this site has been dated to 3574. The second village is a Late Horgen village. Five of the piles are from 3160 and 3159, and two piles are from 3064 and 3062. The site was discovered in 1860 by F. Troyon, who originally thought it was a Bronze Age village. Further excavations in the late 19th and early 20th century found that it was a neolithic site. In 1929-1932, P. Vouga dug a long () deep trench to examine a single layer. He found three archaeological horizons which were from the Middle Neolithic, the Late Neolithic and the end of the Late Neolithic. Based on his study, it appears that the site was covered by an artificial mound which was and about deep. It was built in two stages, with a layer of branches between the layers.

Kosmos 146

Kosmos 146 ( meaning "Cosmos 146"), also known as L-1 No. 2P, was a Soviet test spacecraft precursor to the Zond series, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome aboard a Proton K rocket.
The spacecraft was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to conduct a flyby of the Moon and return to Earth. The primary focus was a Soviet circumlunar flight, which help document the Moon, and also show Soviet power. The test ran from the Zond program from 1967-1970, which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1's re-entry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped, ultimately replaced by the Soyuz 7K-L3.
Objectives.
Kosmos 146 was a Soviet test precursor to the Zond series, launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome aboard a Proton K rocket. It was launched into a planned highly elliptical Earth orbit. The Blok D stage functioned correctly in putting the spacecraft into a translunar trajectory. It was not aimed at the Moon and no recovery of the spacecraft was planned or attempted. It was a successful mission that created false confidence just before a string of failures that would follow.
Kosmos 146 was launched using a Proton-K carrier rocket, which flew from Site 81/23 at Baikonur. The launch occurred at 11:30:33 GMT on 10 March 1967 and was successful. Kosmos 146 was operated in an Earth orbit, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.5° and an orbital period of 89.2 minutes. Kosmos 146 decayed from orbit on 18 March 1967.
Moon race.
By the time the spacecraft was launched, the United States had already thrust into the orbit in their prototype of the lunar vehicle (AS-201, AS-202, AS-203). The United States could go on to launch manned prototypes of lunar ships before the USSR brought the first unmanned prototype into orbit, but two months before the launch of Kosmos-146, during the fire in the command module, the crew of Apollo 1 was killed.

Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright

Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright is a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada. The district is one of 87 districts mandated to return a single member (MLA) to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting. It was contested for the first time in the 2019 Alberta election.
Geography.
The district is coterminous with the municipal districts of Wainwright and Vermilion River in eastern Alberta. It is named for its three largest communities, Vermilion, Lloydminster, and Wainwright. Major thoroughfares include Highway 14, the Yellowhead Highway, the interprovincial Highway 17, and Highway 41.
History.
The district was created in 2017 when the Electoral Boundaries Commission recommended renaming Vermilion-Lloydminster, transferring its portion of Minburn County to Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville and absorbing the MD of Wainwright from Battle River-Wainwright. Although the Commission recommended the name Vermilion-Wainwright for this district, the Legislative Assembly decided to retain Lloydminster in the name at the request of Vermilion-Lloydminster MLA Richard Starke.

Dante Panzeri

Dante Panzeri (November 5, 1921 in Las Varillas, Córdoba – April 14, 1978 in Buenos Aires) was a sports journalist and columnist who was notable for the influence of his opinions and analysis about sports, specially in football, having changed the way of covering sports events in Argentina.
Panzeri is widely considered one of the most notable sports journalists ever in Argentina. Most his work was published on "El Gráfico", where Panzeri worked for almost 20 years.
Biography.
Born in Las Varillas, a small town of Córdoba, Panzeri spent his childhood in the city of San Francisco of the same province. Before the age of 20, he moved to Buenos Aires.
Panzeri joined sports magazine "El Gráfico" in 1943, writing articles about athletics, cycling, and swimming, among others. His articles about football would come much later.
Panzeri's articles about football were notables for the way he dealt with the sport, with emphasis on analysing the game rather than writing a simple chronicle. By the late 1940s, Panzeri was one of the most renowned journalists of "El Gráfico" along with Ricardo Lorenzo Rodríguez (mostly known for his nickname "Borocotó") and Félix Frascara. In the 1950s Panzeri became director of the magazine. During his tenure as director, he brought to the magazine sports journalists such as Pepe Peña, Osvaldo Ardizzone and former Boca Juniors player Ernesto Lazzatti.
Panzeri opposed to the excessive use of tactics in football, with Juan Carlos Lorenzo, Osvaldo Zubeldía, Argentino Geronazzo and José D'Ámico as some trainers that were accused of being excessively obsessed with tactics. Close to Ernesto Lazzatti and Adolfo Pedernera, Panzeri alleged that the use of tactics distorted the essence of the game.
After the 1962 FIFA World Cup held in Chile, Panzeri left his charge in "El Gráfico", after he was pressed to publish advertisements of then Ministry of Economy, Alvaro Alsogaray. He refused alleging the spirit of the magazine would be distorted if he had agreed to that. Panzeri continued his career as journalist in "Así" magazine. In 1965 he had his own TV program, "Discusiones por Deporte" in Canal 7. In 1966 he worked as correspondent for newspaper "Crónica" at the 1966 FIFA World Cup.
In 1967, Panzeri's first book, "Fútbol: Dinámica de lo Impensado", was published. The title expressed the idea that beyond the tactics and strategy planned by a coach, it was the player who decided on the field. In "Dinámica de lo Impensado" Panzeri expressed his preference for the "pure talent" of the Argentine footballer, showing also his concern about the loss of the sport as a simple game and the establishment of an industry around it.
During the 1970s, Panzeri worked for several media such as newspaper "La Opinión" and magazines "Satiricón" and "Goles". He was also chief of the sports section of newspaper "La Prensa" until his death in 1978. His work on the radio include "Radioshow", a program broadcast by Radio Del Plata.
In 1974, he published a second book, "Burguesía y gangsterismo en el deporte", where he took readers behind the scenes at Argentine football's environment, describing the corruption and decadence of executives, coaches, journalists and even supporters.
Panzeri's strong character led him to confront football executives such as Raúl Colombo and Alberto Armando, and even colleagues Bernardo Neustadt and Pepe Peña.
Panzeri also opposed the 1978 FIFA World Cup was held in Argentina, arguing that "it would be a waste of money". About his position, Admiral Carlos Lacoste used to tell an anecdote referring a visit he made to Panzeri's house to convince him about the convenience of holding the Cup in Argentina, with no satisfactory results. Otherwise, Panzeri almost convinced his wife, in Lacoste's own words.
Panzeri died in April 1978, two months before the World Cup that finally would be won by Argentina.

Alessandro Scalzi (died c. 1596, in Munich) was an Italian painter. All his surviving works are now in Bavaria
Life.
Known as 'il Paduano' (the Paduan) despite actually being born in Florence, he was a relative (possibly brother-in-law) of Friedrich Sustris, with whom he collaborated on several works in Augsburg, Munich, Kirchheim and especially the Burg Trausnitz in Landshut. The Burg contains his most notable works, the 1578 "Narrentreppe" or "Ladder of Fools", a staircase with life-size commedia dell'arte frescoes by Scalzi and Sustris along the stairwell and its ceiling and grotesque masks of Pantalone and Zanni by Antonio Ponzano. The work is based on an actual Italian theatre troupe which performed at the wedding feast of William V of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine.
His other works include two panels of St Peter and St Paul for an altarpiece at the parish church in Landsberg am Lech. He collaborated with Christoph Schwartz on martyrdoms of Saint Andrew and Saint Ursula for the Michelkirche in Munich. Scalzi also collaborated with Pieter de Witte on "The Penitent Magdalene" destroyed in 1945 during the Second World War.

Digital leisure studies

Digital leisure studies is an academic interdisciplinary sub-discipline of leisure studies that focuses on the study of digital leisure cultures, including digital leisure practices, experiences, spaces, communities, institutions, and subjectivities. It is an area of scholarship aimed at making sense of the place of digital leisure “in understandings of embodiment, power relations, social inequalities, social structures and social institutions”. To do so, leisure scholars use theoretical and methodological approaches from within leisure studies as well as from other academic disciplines such as political science, history, communication studies, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology, geography, anthropology, and others. Scholars in this field also focus on how to engage digital practices to make their research accessible, and focus on exposing, examining, and challenging social inequalities and injustices related to digital leisure.
Digital leisure.
Digital leisure, similar to leisure, is a contentious term. Leisure has traditionally been defined in three main ways, as time (that which is not work), as activity (freely chosen), and as a state of mind (denoted by such things as intrinsic motivation, perceived freedom, and positive affect). Digital leisure practices and spaces are intertwined with work in ways that physical leisure spaces are not. Widespread surveillance of digital leisure practices and spaces allows companies to benefit monetarily from the data collected during the users’ leisure experiences (hence, the user is indeed working during their leisure time). Therefore, digital leisure is time spent engaged in digital practices and spaces while in a leisurely state of mind.
Digital leisure cultures.
Traditionally, leisure scholars have focused on analogue leisure cultures such as sports, outdoor activities, fandom, and summer camps. In a digital age, there are very few (if any) pure analogue leisure spaces in existence. Most leisure cultures have been digitized in some way. With wearable fitness trackers digitizing every aspect of our leisure (even our sleep) and smartphones-turned-watches, our very leisured bodies have become digital assemblages. Lupton noted how the metaphor of entanglement is commonly used to explain our relationship with digitization, as it “emphasizes the inextricably intertwined relationships of human subjects with material objects” (p. 41). As such, digital leisure cultures refer to the digitization of previous analogue areas of leisure research. Digital leisure cultures “covers some of the following technologies and practices which have built cultures around them: namely apps (applications), smartphones, online games, interaction on some form of social media, and the downloading of films, live televised sports events and music”.
Brabazon has identified two systemic ways in which analogue leisure cultures and digital cultures differ: deterritorialization and disintermediation. Deterritorilization refers to the ways digitization is post-territory. As a concept, it captures “how particular media platforms and communicative systems de-emphasize our position in analogue space and time in favour of virtual space and time”. For example, Brabazon used the example of social media. We can join Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook – and we can be involved in and share content in each of these distinct spaces with each other, even if we do not share physical space with each other.
Disintermediation refers to the ways in which digital leisure cultures involve “peer-to-peer networks where links are removed from the traditional supply chain”. As part of these networks, the producer can also be the consumer (prosumer). In this way, material in digital leisure cultures can be created and disseminated much more quickly than in analogue leisure cultures.
Digital turn: theories and methodologies.
Leisure studies (and academia in general) currently exists in the age of the “digital turn.” The digital turn refers to the different ways digitization influences our lives, including our behaviors, social interactions, environments, economies, and politics. The digital turn signifies a new period in leisure scholarship and demands a conceptual change, one in which leisure scholars turn to new resources and ways of capturing what digitization means for our lives and leisure Redheadnoted, leisure scholars “need to produce sustained theorizing of the “digital turn” in Leisure Studies and with it more satisfactory theoretically informed empirical studies of digital leisure cultures” (p. 828) to engage in broader scholarly conversations.
To do so, it has been suggested leisure scholars shift the ways they are thinking about leisure and draw on different disciplines and theories as resources to begin to shape digital leisure theory and theorizing. For example, Redhead has recommended that digital leisure theory be shaped by critical theory and critical theorists from other disciplines such as philosophers, including Braudrillard, Badiou, Zizek, and Virilio. Redhead presented two concepts to guide digital leisure theory: accelerated culture and claustropolitanism.
Karl Spracklen has presented a theory of communicative and instrumental digital leisure drawing on theorists such as Habermas, Catells, Urry, and Bauman. He argued that digital leisure is more communicative given its possibilities for interactivity and resisting power disparities, but despite these possibilities, it is not immune to instrumental structures that shape traditional (non-digitized) popular leisure. In this way, digital leisure should not be seen as something novel, but as “just another leisure space.” In his work, he has also emphasized the work of leisure theorists, such as Rojek, Stebbins, Aitchison, Blackshaw, Giulianotti and Crouch, who have focused attention towards understanding and critically engaging with digital leisure.
With the digital turn in research, also comes the need to consider methodologies and methods used to effectively study digital leisure cultures. Digital leisure scholars are still actively working to envision new methodologies and methods and retool existing ones. Netnography, virtual ethnography /cyberethnography/digital ethnography, digital storytelling, digital and visual methodologies, digital media methodologies, and critical technocultural discourse analysis are some examples of such methodologies and methods.

Richard R. Wright Jr.

Richard Robert Wright Jr. (April 16, 1878 in Cuthbert, Georgia – December 12, 1967) was an American sociologist, social worker, and minister. In 1911, Wright became the first African American to earn a doctorate in sociology from an organized graduate school when he received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. 
Wright was the editor from 1909-1936 for "The Christian Recorder", then based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is known as "the oldest existing periodical published by African-Americans in the United States whose existence dated before the Civil War."
Early life and education.
Richard Robert Wright Jr. was born on April 16, 1878, in Cuthbert, Georgia. He attended Georgia State College, the first public historically black college in the state. His father Richard Robert Wright was founding president in 1891 and served for thirty years. Wright began attending the Divinity School at the University of Chicago in 1898, where he found mentors in William Rainey Harper and Shailer Mathews.
In 1903 Wright studied in Berlin, Germany, in part inspired by the academic path of W.E.B. DuBois. Wright studied in Berlin for a term then went to the University of Leipzig, where he wrote his thesis "The Historicity of the Acts of the Apostles". He submitted his thesis to the University of Chicago who offered him “an AM… and a fellowship in New Testament Theology and doctorate [in theology]”.
Influenced by DuBois, Wright had become interested in the new field of sociology and moved to Philadelphia to work on it. In 1911, Wright became the first African-American to earn a doctorate in sociology from an organized graduate school when he received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. He wrote his dissertation on "History of the Pennsylvania Negro" under the supervision of Professor Carl Kelsey. He was one of the first African Americans to earn a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Wright was preceded by at least one other African-American at Penn: Pezavia O'Connell, who earned a PhD in 1898, in Semitic Studies, for a dissertation on notions of the clean and unclean in the Hebrew Bible. During his time in the doctoral program at Penn, Wright overlapped with the suffragist Alice Paul, and they shared the same advisor in Carl Kelsey.
Education was one of the building blocks that defined Wright. Early in life he studied under his father, who was a strong role model. Georgia State College was the first college he attended, where his father was the president. Georgia State College was a technical college that offered few classical courses. After Wright graduated from Georgia State College in 1898, he enrolled in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. The University had a significant influence on his life. Here he was introduced to biblical studies, and he followed his own path into ministry. Soon after he received his Bachelor of Divinity Degree (1901) and Masters in Biblical Languages (1904), he gained an interest in the new field of sociology. This interest led him to the University of Pennsylvania, where he followed the work of W.E.B. DuBois. He wrote his dissertation on the Philadelphia Negro under the supervision of Carl Kelsey.
Career.
From 1909 to 1936, Wright served as editor for "The Christian Recorder", "the oldest existing periodical published by African-Americans in the United States whose existence dated before the Civil War." Based in Philadelphia since 1852, it was a primary literary voice for the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church), the first black independent denomination founded in the United States. It also was a major source of news and information about the black community across several regions. As editor, Wright focused on social welfare, becoming a leading advocate on migrant rights during the Great Migration of African Americans to the North from the rural South.
During his editorship, Wright was also deeply involved in banking. He and his father had founded the Citizen's and Southern Bank Building in Philadelphia. Wright advocated for African-American owned banks that served not only as financial institutions, but as symbols of independence and self-reliance for blacks.
In 1928, Wright returned to the ministry as the pastor of the Ward AME Church in Philadelphia.
In 1932, Wright moved from Philadelphia to Wilberforce, Ohio, to serve as the 9th President of Wilberforce University. Founded during the Civil War, this was the first college to be owned and operated by African Americans. He served for a total of 5 years, from 1932–1936, and 1941–1942.
Personal life.
Wright was the son of Elizabeth Lydia Wright née Howard and Richard R. Wright, then a veteran American military officer, educator and college president. His father also was active as a politician, civil rights advocate, and later, as a banking entrepreneur. The young Wright was called by religion from an early age. As a child he used to play church and preached to other neighborhood children. At thirteen Wright became a Sunday school teacher at his church. He later decided to join the ministry. Wright was also inclined toward social justice at a young age. His father encouraged his children to have black role models like W.E.B. DuBois and to pursue careers that would help others. 
In regard to his decision to join the ministry, Wright said
“I was much inclined toward law; to devoting my life to getting my people’s legal rights, which were being increasingly denied. Still back of my mind was that one desire to preach. I had never seen but one colored lawyer.”
He married Charlotte Crogman, daughter of Wright family friends, Dr. William H. Crogman and his wife. Dr. Crogman was the first black president of Clark Atlanta University. After several years of courting and a long friendship, Wright proposed to Charlotte after a game of tennis. The two were married for 49 years, until her death in 1959. They had four children together: Ruth, Richard III, Alberta Lavina, and Grace Lydia Wright.
Wright was an avid reader and sportsman, particularly fond of swimming, baseball, and tennis. He disdained dancing, drinking, and card playing. He joined the Democratic Party in the 1930s, and was a public supporter of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

Eliza (1800 ship)

Eliza was built in Spain in 1794 under another name and taken as a prize circa 1800. She then made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC). On her return she made one voyage to Timor as a whaler. She next became a West Indiaman. In 1810 she apparently was sold to Portuguese interests and who continued to sail her under the name "Courier de Londres". She is last listed in 1814.
Career.
"Eliza" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1800 with Holeman, master, Richardson, owner, and trade London–"Hope" (Cape of Good Hope). The entry describes her as being Spanish, and six years old.
Captain Francis Holman acquired a letter of marque on 27 September 1800. Messrs. Princip and Saunders then tendered her to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed between December 1800 and February 1801.
Holman sailed "Eliza" from Calcutta on 11 December 1801. On 21 January 1802 she was at Saugor. She reached St Helena on 11 April and arrived at The Downs on 11 June.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1802 shows Holman as both "Eliza"s master an owner, and her trade changing from London–Cape of Good Hope, to London–Demerara. ("Lloyd's Register" shows her trade as Liverpool–Demerara.)
"Lloyd's Register" for 1803 shows her master changing from Holman to J. Richards, her owner changing from Capt. &amp; Co. to Darknell, and her trade from Liverpool–Demerara to London–Southern Fisheries.
Captain Joseph Richards sailed from England on 5 December 1803, bound for Timor. On 7 July 1804 "Eliza" was at Timor. Between 10 and 15 August 1804 she was among a number of whalers from London that were well at Timor, including , , , and others. On 29 January 1806 "Eliza" was at St Helena. She returned to England on 22 April 1806.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1807 still shows "Eliza" with Richards, master, Darknell, owner, and trade London–Southern fisheries. However, in 1807 "Eliza" underwent a large repair, and re-coppering. She emerged with N. Brown, master, Whytock, owner, and trade London–Montevideo.
On 10 January 1808 "Eliza", Brown, master, sailed from Port-au-Prince, bound for England. She sailed in company with "Diana" and "Henry", of Liverpool. On 11 January three privateers attacked them, but they were able to repel them. The next day six privateers attacked them four times before the privateers gave up. On the 13th a gale forced "Henry", which was in a leaky state, to part and sail to Jamaica. "Diana" and "Eliza" parted on 28 February near Cape Clear. "Diana" arrived safely at Liverpool. "Eliza" arrived safely at Portsmouth.
"Lloyd's Register" and the "Shipping Register" for 1809 still show Brown as master and Whytock as owner. However, the show her trade as London–Montevideo and London–Demerara, respectively. "Eliza" disappears from subsequent issues of the registers.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1810, however, shows the entry of "Courier de Londres", Spanish prize of 268 tons (bm), which underwent large repairs in 1807. Her master is De Silva, her owners are Portuguese interests, and her trade is London– the . "Commerce de Londres" appears in the 1811 issue of "Lloyd's Register" with M. De Silva, master, Capt. &amp; Co. owner, and trade London–Pernambuco. She had undergone a thorough repair in 1807, her burthen is 270 tons, and her origin is Spain with a launch year of 1794. She is no longer listed in "Lloyd's Register" for 1812, but continues to appear as "Courier de Londres" in the "Register of Shipping".
Fate.
"Courier de Londres" is last listed in 1814.

Undertaking (band)

Undertaking was a Hungarian thrash metal band formed in Budapest in 1988. The band consisted of György Killan (lead vocals, guitar), Viktor Jakab (bass guitar) and Imre Esztári (drums). Undertaking was active for only about a year, yet it became one of the most successful bands of the Hungarian thrash metal scene at the end of the 1980s. The members organized and ran the wildly popular monthly thrash metal event that operated under the banner of Thrash Mosh Club in Újpest (Budapest) at Ländler Jenő Művelődési Ház where they were the house band. The 7-song demo recorded in December 1988 titled "V12BB4U" and was distributed through mail order and small independent record shops. Singing in English made it next to impossible to have their music published through any official channels of the socialist Hungary of that era. Despite their popularity, Undertaking broke up at the end 1989 due to inner frictions. They played their last show at Vienna's Rockhaus opening for Rage.
A book (hard cover, 545p) documenting the band's brief existence set against the backdrop of rapidly changing social structure in Hungary at the close of the nineties, written (in Hungarian) by Ákos Dudich and Viktor Jakab, titled "Undertaking – Thrash metal Magyarországon a rendszerváltás idején" (in English: "Undertaking – Thrash metal in Hungary at the time of regime change") was published in 2017 and included a CD of the band's re-issued demo tape with some previously unpublished bonus material.
History.
Before Undertaking.
Gyorgy Killan, born and raised in Kiev, Ukraine, where he received his rudimentary musical education and where his early forays into music included get-togethers with a couple of neighbourhood friends for loud noise making sessions on home-made instruments and calling themselves Children of Zeus, moved to Hungary in the mid-eighties and after a period of adjustment to the new life and learning the new language began his active pursuit of musical opportunities. He played guitar in a couple of local bands like Leopard and Metal Corpus with Zoltán “Pici” Fejes (who went on to found Classica). His self-recorded 1988 Killan demo tape received positive reviews (recording multiple instruments by himself bouncing tracks between two reel-to-reel tape decks was considered a novelty in those days) and brought some name recognition in the metal scene. His musical influences of the bands like Metallica, Kreator and above all Slayer as well as classical music can be heard in this demo.
Viktor Jakab, born in Miskolc, Hungary, had played in the local band Reaktor before moving to Budapest to attend the University of Economics.
Killan met Jakab at a friend's band's rehearsal where Viktor was auditioning for the bass guitar spot and convinced him to join forces.
Together they set off on a search of a drummer. Seeing Imre Esztári of Neckrofight play at a gig they were immediately impressed by his skill level and drumming style they recruited him on the spot.
After poaching Esztári from Neckrofight they began rehearsing as a band and adopted the name Undertaking.
Thrash Mosh Club.
Ländler Jenő Cultural Centre was an underused Railroad Union Community Centre located in a run down area of Újpest (a North/West district of Budapest) next to the train tracks and a station, that had a concert hall with a proper stage and holding capacity of over a thousand. The band found a place to practice there and it soon became home of their monthly metal fest nights - Thrash Mosh Club - the first of its kind in the country.
Enlisting the marketing talents of Péter “Manitou” Somogyi, who has later become the band's manager and promotional skills of Zsolt "Gülü" Gürtler they were able to consistently put on a full 5-6 hour program once a month, showcasing the latest metal music videos (projected on an enormous movie screen), doing fun contests and comedy skits, finishing off with a live performance of several bands, with Undertaking, being the house band, as the closing act of the evening. The event became immensely popular in the underground metal scene, attracting crowds of up to a thousand and fans from all over Hungary and even some neighbouring countries. The club's stage became a magnet for many local (and some foreign) metal bands contributing to the diverse and ever changing guest band line up, bands like Atomic, Pestilence, Almighty, The Bedlam, Beyond, Mirror and many others.
In the pre-internet, pre-social media and pre-home computer era in Hungary all concert promotion had to be done the grass roots style - flyers and posters drawn by hand, band members and friends putting up posters and distributing flyers. One curios fact: several concert fliers and posters, as well as the Thrash Mosh Club logo were designed by a good friend of the band Zoltan Bathory, who was studying graphic design at the time and in more recent years has been touring the world with his own band Five Finger Death Punch (USA).
After the break up of Undertaking the Thrash Mosh Club organizers continued to put on isolated events for a few more years, but in the more recent times the concert hall was converted into a billiard hall and is now host to nationwide and international snooker tournaments.
"V12BB4U" demo and the "Garázs" compilation.
Banking on the favourable currency exchange rates and on Killan's old music scene connections in his native Ukraine the band travelled to Kiev in December 1988 to record a 7-song demo ("V12BB4U" - read out with a thick Chinese or Russian accent it approximates "We Want To Be Before You").
The recording session took place at the Kiev's National Film Studios, which ordinarily recorded full orchestras for movie sound tracks. Due to the studio not being tailored to or having any experience recording metal, the resulting sound quality left much to be desired.
Despite the poor sound quality the demo was warmly received back home with several hundred copies sold through mail order and independent record shops within a few months and has since become a collector's item.
The Demo Tape featured the following tracks:
"Garazs" (Garage) was a compilation album of local indie bands - a brain child of Nagy Feró, at the time a well known rock musician and media persona with his own national radio show. Undertaking was offered a chance to submit a song for this LP. The album came out in 1989, but due to a mix-up (the master was submitted on a reel tape, with no time stamps the only way to identify the songs was to count them from the beginning) the wrong song (instead of "Reactor #4" as was printed on the label and jacket) "The Runner" was featured on it and the band's name was misprinted as "Undertacking".
Break-up.
Undertaking disbanded in late 1989 with their last live performance in Vienna, Austria on 13 October 1989 opening for the Germany's Rage. Inner tensions and lack of commitment were cited as the main reasons.

Matilda Maranda Crawford

Matilda Maranda Crawford (pen names, Maude Moore, M. M., Mrs. John Crawford; 21 July 1844 – 24 December 1920) was an American-Canadian newspaper correspondent and poet.
Early years.
Matilda (nicknames Mattie or Maty) Maranda Quackenbush was born in Clay, New York, near Syracuse, in 21 July 1844. She was of German ancestry. Her father, Garret Quackenbush, was a laborer, and her mother, Sarah Reese, was a tailor.
In 1851, Crawford, her mother, and five older siblings removed to Consecon, Prince Edward County, Ontario, where Crawford attended a grammar school. Quick to learn, at the age of twelve she stood at the head of her classes, but had never written a composition. Gifted with an active and retentive memory, each bit of poetry she heard was remembered, and when but a child, she recited at one time the whole of Oliver Goldsmith 's "The Deserted Village".
Career.
As an adult, Crawford lived in Michigan for some time, and while there, she was engaged in teaching. It was at that time that she commenced to contribute to the literary press. In 1868, she returned to Canada, locating in Newtonville, Ontario. While there, she wrote for various Canadian and American newspapers as a pastime.
In 1871, she married John Crawford (1840-1912), of Clarke, Ontario. For a few years, her literary efforts were laid aside, owing to domestic responsibilities. She had two children, a boy and girl (Maude). In 1887, an entire summer's illness afforded her leisure for literary work, and thereafter she wrote for the press. She used various assumed names, including "Maude Moore", "M. M.", and "Mrs. John Crawford".
Crawford died of a stroke in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 24 December 1920, and was buried at Port Hope Union Cemetery.

Validation (gang membership)

Validation is a legal process in the United States where criminal justice authorities (prison officials, parole officers, police officers, or prosecutors) designate that a person is a member of a gang. Once a person is validated as a gang member, the person is subject to increased sentences, harsher punishments (such as solitary confinement) and more restrictive parole rules.
To validate a person as a gang member, the officials generally must provide evidence of several factors, such as tattoos, photographs, admissions, clothing, etc. The list of criteria for the state of California is found in California Code of Regulations Title 15, Article 10 3375.3 and 3378.2.
The legal requirements for validating a person are much lower than the requirements for convicting of a crime.

1982 Liberation Memorial

The 1982 Liberation Memorial is a war memorial in Stanley, Falkland Islands. It commemorates all British Forces and supporting units that served in the Falklands War and helped liberate the Falkland Islanders from Argentine military occupation in 1982. The Memorial is situated in front of the Secretariat Building, overlooking Stanley Harbour. The funds for the Memorial were raised entirely by Falkland Islanders and it was unveiled by the Governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Rex Hunt, on Liberation Day (14 June) 1984, the second anniversary of the end of the war.
Design.
The Memorial consists of an obelisk on the front of which is the coat of arms of the Falkland Islands surrounded by a laurel wreath above the words "In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us" and the date the war ended; "14 June 1982". On top of the obelisk is a bronze figure of Britannia, the female personification of the island of Great Britain. On the back and sides of the Memorial are the lists of the British Army regiments, RAF squadrons, Royal Navy vessels and the Royal Marine formations and units that took part in the conflict. The names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war are listed on ten plaques behind the Memorial, divided into the service branches. Directly behind the Memorial is a relief depicting famous moments during the war.
The Memorial was designed by Falklands-born architect Gerald Dixon and the bronze figure of Britannia was sculpted by David Norris.
In 2015 a bust of Margaret Thatcher (who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time of the 1982 war) was erected next to the Liberation Memorial.
Usage.
Services are held at the Memorial each year on 14 June (Liberation Day) and on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November (Armistice Day), with wreaths being laid at the foot of the Memorial.
The Memorial has also been featured in commemorative coins and postage stamps issued by the Falkland Islands government.

Worth (film)

Worth is a 2020 biographical film directed by Sara Colangelo, from a screenplay by Max Borenstein. It stars Michael Keaton, Amy Ryan, Stanley Tucci, Tate Donovan, Shunori Ramanathan, and Laura Benanti. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2020. The film was released in a limited release and on Netflix on September 3, 2021.
Plot.
The film opens with Kenneth Feinberg detailing the law's recognition of the monetary value of a person's life to his class at Columbia University.
Some time later, the September 11 attacks occur. Feinberg is appointed the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy. Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80% of the 7000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose. Feinberg is given until January 1, 2004 to accomplish this.
At an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the loss of the hostile audience. The crowd is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say. After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank, the brother of a deceased FDNY firefighter, Nick Donato. Feinberg is disturbed when he learns that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.
Biros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims, and is personally moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner was killed in the attacks. Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of a state which does not recognize civil partnerships. Feinberg meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks. As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of the Bush administration.
A lawyer respresenting Donato's mistress calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has 2 illegitimate daughters who qualify for compensation, leading Feinberg to inform Donato's widow in a failed effort to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused. As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful. After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his wife encouraged him to perservere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.
Feinberg and Biros begin to bend the rules in order to cover as many victims as they can under the fund, lobbying for changes in state laws to accomplish this. Feinberg begins to meet with victims personally and accumulates a shrine in his office constructed from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants. When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his followers to trust Feinberg. By the end of the deadline, Feinberg's office is able to serve the vast majority of eligible applicants and Feinberg himself is able to convince Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's daughters. Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that, while she was unable to help him, she was able to help many people like him.
The film ends with a title card stating that Feinberg and Biros were able to distribute billions in government money to 97% of eligible victims, and that they continue to work on similar cases.

Nature therapy

Nature therapy, sometimes referred to as ecotherapy, forest therapy, forest bathing, grounding, earthing, Shinrin-Yoku or Sami Lok is a practice that describes a broad group of techniques or treatments to use nature to improve mental or physical health. 
Spending time in nature has various physiological benefits such as relaxation. 
History.
In the 6th century BCE, Cyrus the Great planted a garden in the middle of a city to increase human health. In the 16th century CE, Paracelsus wrote: “The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician.” Scientists in the 1950's looked into why people chose to spend time in nature. "Shinrin-yoku" () or forest bathing was coined by the head of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Tomohide Akiyama, in 1982 to encourage more visitors to forests. 
Health effects.
Mood.
120 minutes in nature weekly could improve health and well-being. As little as five minutes in a natural setting, improves mood, self-esteem, and motivation. Nature therapy probably has a benefit in reducing stress and improving a person's mood.
Forest therapy has been linked to some physiological benefits as indicated by neuroimaging and the Profile of mood states psychological test.
Horticulture therapy has been linked to general well-being by boosting positive mood and escaping from daily life stressors.
Stress and depression.
Interaction with nature can decrease stress and depression.
 Forest therapy might help stress management for all age groups.
Social horticulture could help with depression and other mental health problems of PTSD, abuse, lonely elderly people, drug or alcohol addicts, blind people and other people with special needs. Nature therapy could also improve self-management, self-esteem, social relations and skills, socio-political awareness and employability. Nature therapy could reduce aggression and improve relationship skills.
Other possible benefits.
Nature therapy could help with general medical recovery, pain reduction, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, dementia, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency. 
Criticism.
A 2012 systematic review study showed inconclusive results related to the methodology used in studies. Spending time in forests demonstrated positive health effects, but not enough to generate clinical practice guidelines or demonstrate causality. Additionally, there are concerns from researchers expressing that time spent in nature as a form of regenerative therapy is highly personal and entirely unpredictable. Nature can be harmed in the process of human interaction.
Grounding.
Grounding, or earthing, is a pseudoscientific practice that involves people grounding themselves using devices by touching the earth or removing shoes. People who ground themselves believe that they have been exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation. Possible changes in mood could be due to a placebo effect.
Support.
In Finland, researchers recommend five hours a month in nature to reduce depression, alcoholism, and suicide. Forest therapy has state-backing in Japan. South Korea has a nature therapy program for firefighters with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Ordos campaign (1592)

The Ordos campaign of 1592, also called the Ningxia campaign () or Pubei rebellion (), was a rebellion against the Ming dynasty by Liu Dongyang and Pubei, a Chahar Mongol who had previously submitted to the Ming, and its suppression.
Background.
Pubei submitted to the Ming dynasty and brought with him 100 followers. He eventually became a military commissioner of Huamachi near Ningxia, and more promotions and rewards from the court followed, despite official complaints of unruliness caused by Pubei and his sons. In 1589 Pubei was promoted to regional vice commander of Ningxia and his son Bo Cheng'en took up his old post. At this point he had with him 3,000 personal retainers and wished to retire, handing over the post to his son. However Grand Coordinator Dang Xin refused the transfer of power. Over the next three years Pubei and Dang Xin clashed over a number of issues. Dang refused to supply Pubei's personal retainers on the grounds that they weren't in the employ of the government, and therefore not eligible for government support. Dang also flogged Bo Cheng'en in public, apparently for attempting to steal another official's wife. Following that, he ordered the arrest of Pubei's followers after their return from a campaign to the northwest.
Pubei followed government protocols and tried to seek redress from the government, but this only angered Dang more.
In March 1592 a Han officer called Liu Dongyang mutinied and killed Dang Xin. They seized some 47 fortresses in the outlying area and demanded autonomy from the Ming government or else they would ally with the Ordos Mongols.
News of the rebellion reached the court on 19 April 1592.
Battle.
Wei Xueceng was invested with full authority by the Wanli Emperor and dispatched commanders to defend the south bank of the Yellow River.
The border fortresses were retaken within a few weeks until only Ningxia was left. However at this point Wei complained that he did not have the necessary manpower or resources to take the city. He lobbied for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
The stalemate lasted for six weeks. Ming forces entrenched themselves around Ningxia but were continuously harassed by Mongol horsemen. An attempted assault on the city resulted in the defeat of 3,000 rebels and the recovery of some military equipment, but Ming forces were unable to breach the city defenses, suffering heavy casualties.
Mongol forces raided nearby cities and cut off the Ming supply lines, encircling the entrenched Ming positions.
Li Rusong and Ye Mengxiong were called in to resolve the situation. Ye Mengxiong arrived at the nearby city of Lingzhou on 14 July with 400 cannons, fire carts, and a contingent of Miao troops from the southwest. The Ming divided their forces into five armies, four for each gate, and a mobile corps under Ma Gui. Two weeks later Pubei's men sallied out and engaged in battle with Ma Gui. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but Pubei was repelled with cannon fire. Apparently the rebels' Mongol allies were supposed to attack from the rear during the battle but they refused.
Li Rusong and Mei Guozhen arrived by the end of July and bombarded the city walls with cannon fire which did nothing. On 2 August, Li Ruzhang, Li Rusong's brother, attempted to scale the walls with ladders but failed. On 3 August, Gong Zijing attacked the south gate with Miao troops while Li Rusong tried to scale the walls, but they were repelled by arrows and cannon fire. They tried again in the night but failed again.
The Wanli Emperor grew frustrated with the situation and dismissed Wei Xueceng, replacing him with Ye Mengxiong. A new plan to flood the city was approved and the army began constructing dikes around Ningxia. The dikes were completed 23 August. Pubei tried to send for help, but his dispatch was ambushed and killed. Nevertheless, Ming forces under Ma Gui and Dong Yiyuan were sent out to deal with the Mongol chieftain Bushugtu. Except for one loss, the Ming were able to drive away the Mongols.
The city was flooded and by 6 September, the water around the city walls was nine feet deep. The situation within the city was desperate. Officers were eating horses while commoners ate tree bark. On 7 September a section of the dike southeast of the city collapsed and the rebels attempted to escape in boats, but were repelled. Mei Guozhen called for their surrender on 17 September but received no response. On 25 September the rebels bombarded the Ming forces from atop the city walls while Mongol leader Jorightu attacked from the north with a force of 18,000. Li Rusong and Ma Gui repelled the Mongols in an encircling maneuver.
By 12 October the north wall had collapsed under the water and Ming soldiers were able to take the south wall. Seeing this, the rebel leaders fell upon themselves in hopes of clemency. Bo Cheng'en surrendered while Pubei committed suicide through self-immolation.
Aftermath.
Li Rusong was promoted to supreme commander, Ye Mengxiong became censor in chief of the right, and Xiao Ruxun became vice commissioner in chief. Li Rusong was then hurried to Korea to defend it from the Japanese.
Wei Xueceng was released from prison and restored to his official rank, but he died at home in obscurity.

Lower Bell

The Lower Bell is a pub on the A229 Blue Bell Hill, between Chatham and Maidstone in Kent. It is located at the edge of the North Downs where the A229 meets the Pilgrims' Way. 
A pub has existed in the general area since around 1790, when the A229 was a turnpike road for coaches. The map maker and artist Paul Sandby painted "A Distant View of Maidstone, from Lower Bell Inn, Boxley Hill" in 1802, which depicts a view of the town from the pub. It is marked at its current location on a large-scale 1832 map of Kent. The current building was constructed in 1865.
The purpose of the bell was for travellers to warn others further up the hill of their presence, as the road was too narrow for two teams of coach and horses to pass each other. There was a corresponding pub at the top of the hill called The Upper Bell, which would ring in response. The Upper Bell was demolished in 2013.
The Lower Bell is cited as a location for a common ghost story, which originates from a fatal car accident involving a bride-to-be on the A229 outside the premises in November 1965. The typical story involves the apparition of a young woman attempting to hitch a lift outside the pub into the centre of Maidstone or another local village, who subsequently vanishes en route. A local journalist attempted to verify the story for the "Maidstone Gazette" in 1968, but was unable to find any suitable eyewitnesses after months of research. In 2015, on the fiftieth anniversary of the accident, a paranormal enthusiasts group met in the Lower Bell to discuss the various ghost stories. A short film, entitled "The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill", was shot around the premises.
Live music is a regular feature at the Lower Bell. The pub runs a jam session every Monday.

Ori Naftaly

Ori Naftaly (born 1987) is an Israeli-born guitarist, composer and music producer. After founding the Ori Naftaly Band in Israel, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee and established the Southern Avenue band.
Biography.
Ori Naftaly grew up in the small town of Even Yehuda, east of Netanya. At the age of 5, Ori began taking music lessons and learned to play guitar. Until graduating from Hadassim High School at the age of 17, he studied guitar with different teachers from a wide range of music genres (Spanish, Classical, Jazz and Funk). After graduation he was accepted to Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music where he enrolled in Arrangement and Composition studies. After two years at Rimon (and studying Classical Guitar with Israeli musician Shlomo Yidov), he recorded with musicians all over Israel while pursuing a day job as a Microsoft systems engineer.
Music career.
In 2011, Naftaly recorded his debut album with the Ori Naftaly Band. "A True Friend (Is Hard to Find)", was picked as the Best Blues Album in 2012 by Jan Marius Franzen from bluesmagazine.nl and syndicated radio show "Purple Haze." In the German magazine "Wasser Prawda" the album was picked #2 as Best Blues Debut and named Best Debut in Israel on 88FM by Tomer Molvidzon.
In October 2012 he won the Israeli Blues Society competition, and the band was voted the Best Israeli Blues Band of 2013, earning them an invitation to the 29th International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee. The band made it to the semi-finals, selling the largest amount of CDs in the competition and becoming the first Israeli group to reach the semi-finals in this global event. Their second album, "Happy For Good", was released in May 2013 (again, by Naftaly himself) and featured eight new original songs; Naftaly produced the album and composed most of the music. A month after its release, "Happy For Good" reached number 2 on the International Blues Radio Charts, and stayed in the Top 5 for eight weeks. After touring the US and Europe, Naftaly relocated to Memphis. Upon moving to the United States in October 2013, Naftaly enlisted a new core of Memphis musicians, and played over 200 shows in over 40 states.
In Memphis, he met Tierinii Jackson who began her career singing in church, before performing in a series of cover bands and theatrical projects. Tierinii's sister, a drummer and vocalist, joined the pair in September 2015 to form Southern Avenue. With Jeremy Powell on keys and Daniel McKee on bass, the band entered the International Blues Challenge in 2016 representing Memphis. Southern Avenue made the finals.
In the summer of 2016, Southern Avenue signed with Stax Records, part of the Concord Music Group. They recorded their debut album with producer Kevin Houston and it was released in February 2017. The album charted at number 1 on the iTunes Blues charts, reached #6 on the Billboard Blues Chart and was in the Top 40 in Americana radio for three months. In 2019, they released "Keep On", produced by Johnny Black.

She is played by Nia Vardalos.
Ian Miller.
Ian Miller, known as Thomas Miller in the TV show, is Toula's husband. He falls in love with Toula and asks her to marry him.

Sajjan Singh Rangroot

Sajjan Singh Rangroot is a 2018 Indian Punjabi-language war drama film directed by Pankaj Batra. It stars Diljit Dosanjh, Yograj Singh and Sunanda Sharma. The movie is based on a true story about the experiences of Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army fighting on the Western Front during World War I. The movie was released on 23 March 2018 to coincide with the death anniversary of Bhagat Singh. On release, the film got positive reviews from both critics and audience. The movie is expected to be dubbed into Hindi by Cinekorn Entertainment and English. Sajjan Singh Rangroot is eighth highest grossing Punjabi film of all time and third highest-grossing film of 2018.
On 22 June 2018, Sajjan Singh Rangroot's exclusive internet rights were acquired by SHAREit
Plot.
In the present, many Sikh volunteers come to the Syria-Iraq border to help out refugees. An elderly Sikh volunteer tells his volunteers (especially a curious girl) about Sajjan Singh Rangroot, a soldier who fought in World War I.
In the early 20th century, Sajjan was a young Sikh man who disliked the British. Sajjan's father worked for the British. Sajjan's father wanted Sajjan to work for the British as well. As World War 1 was going on, Sajjan wanted to be a soldier for the British Indian army. He hoped that if the British won, India would gain independence. His father disliked the idea, but his mother was not against it. So Sajjan joins the army after an emotional farewell from his family. He becomes friends with many other soldiers like Dheera, Teja, Lacchman Das, and Mela Singh. Teja was an arrogant person, and Mela Singh was a person who lied a lot to get attention. Him lying leads to hilarious reactions. The Subedar (Leader) of the group was Zorawar Singh, who has fought many wars before. After rigorous training, the group reaches Britain to fight. The group were the Lahore Regiment.
When the regiment reaches Britain, many British soldiers make fun of the Sikhs. The soldiers train even more. At a tea shop, Sajjan and one British soldier try to have a fight, but the owner of the shop, who is called Becky, stops them as she does not want the tables and chairs to break. Sajjan then leaves the soldier alone. Becky then starts to like Sajjan. Sajjan finds out, but he is betrothed to someone called Jeeti.
The Sikhs and British find out that the Germans have invaded many British trenches. So the British and Sikhs have to get to a trench before the Germans attack. This is as the trench will protect them. During that, the Germans attack. However, the Sikhs and British get the trench and later capture the main German trench line, forcing the Germans to retreat. But Dheera dies during that. Sajjan becomes really disturbed, but Zorawar makes Sajjan better. The Germans find out that Sikhs are helping the British in the war. So, the Germans send them a letter. The letter says that the Sikhs should join the Germans as they will get better equipment, food, and more salary. Sajjan refuses as Sikhs should not be traitors.
After a month of staying in the trenches, Mela Singh tells Sajjan that it is Baisakhi. But the Baisakhi is a sad one. So Sajjan tries to make everyone happy by singing a song. After, the Germans attack the trench, and the Sikhs and the British escape. The Germans take over the trench. Teja dies during that. So Sajjan decides to go into the battlefield alone and bomb the trench. Sajjan is successful, and all Germans in the trench die. However, Sajjan dies as well.
In India, the British and the people pay their respects to Sajjan. In the present, the elderly Sikh volunteer shows the curious girl a photo of Zorawar (the volunteer's grandfather) and Sajjan. The Sikh volunteers now feel motivated to be like Sajjan Singh Rangroot.
Production.
Faversham Market in Kent was used in multiple scenes of the film, in which WWI soldiers are seen marching through the town.
Soundtrack.
All the songs of the soundtrack album were composed by Jatinder Shah. The song "Pyaas" was composed by Uttam Singh. 
Reception.
Critical response.
Mike McCahill of "The Guardian" gave three stars out of five and concluded "Batra hits most of his big emotional beats, rightly sensing there might be something stirring and striking in the sight of beturbaned warriors charging across a field in Belgium". Jyoti Sharma Bawa of "Hindustan Times" gave two stars out of five, She said ""Sajjan Singh Rangroot"'s main fault is that it tries to do much".

Imri Kalmann

Imri Kalmann (; born June 17, 1986) is a social activist and former co-chairperson of the Israeli LGBT Association. He is an entrepreneur and a Tel Aviv nightlife personality who has opened several successful clubs in the city.
TheMarker magazine chose Kalmann as one of 40 most promising young people of 2015, for his political and nightlife activities, and in 2016, he was chosen by the website Mako as one of the most influential people in the gay community in Israel.
Early life.
Kalmann was born in Haifa and is the youngest son of Dov Kalmann and Sylvia Cohen, immigrants from the Netherlands. At an early age, he moved with his family to Kfar Saba. His parents divorced when he was eight years old, and later, his father came out of the closet, after his grandfather came out of the closet before that.
He served in the IDF for five years, during which he served as an adjutant in the Armored Corps, as team commander of corps officer completion courses, and as a human resource development officer for the navy's submarine project.
Public Activity.
In August, 2009, Kalmann joined the ranks of the Israel Gay Youth organization (IGY), where he volunteered for five years. He served as a youth counselor for youth groups and as the educational coordinator for the Sharon district counselors.
In 2012 and 2013, Kalmann was chosen to lead the Tel Aviv gay pride parade campaign. As the campaign designer, he created the image “It’s Worth Being Proud” (“Let it B”) in which the leaders of the gay community in Israel participated.
In 2015, Kalmann was elected co-chairperson of the LGBT Association, together with Chen Arieli, who is currently serving as the organization's chairperson. At that time, the association led organizational changes and collaborations with other gay organizations in Israel. The association grew tenfold in number of members and increased the community's organizational budget from 1.5 million shekels a year, to 11 million shekels. He decided not to allow Education Minister Naftali Bennett to speak at the memorial ceremony for the late Shira Banki and the murder victims at the gay center Bar-Noar, because of the minister's refusal to sign a statement of commitment to the rights of the community.
Kalmann and Arieli initiated a special day in the Knesset devoted to the rights of the gay community, They also led a protest against the homophobic remarks by Rabbi Yigal Levinstein, which led to the Ministry of Defense prohibiting his entry to IDF bases, a petition to the Supreme Court of Israel for gay marriage, petition to the high court for equality in registering children of female couples, and a struggle that led to the Ministry of Health and Magen David Adom decision allowing homosexuals and bisexuals to donate blood.
In the run-up to the twentieth Knesset elections, Kalmann was elected to the 17th place by Meretz on the party's Knesset list. In 2017, he announced his entry into politics and his integration into the leadership of the Meretz party. He was later elected chairperson of the Tel-Aviv branch and declared his candidacy for party chairperson.

List of Raven Software games

Raven Software is an American video game developer based in Madison, Wisconsin. It was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel after getting a publishing deal for their first game, "Black Crypt" (1992). During that game's development, the company formed a relationship with id Software, which was briefly located on the same street. Raven spent the next few years working primarily on PC games in partnership with id, making "ShadowCaster" (1993) with a game engine by id Software and three games in the "Heretic" series between 1994–1997 with id as the publisher and id Software employees as the producers. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision, and the Raffel brothers subsequently sold the company to Activision. Several employees left the company then to form Human Head Studios.
Raven spent the next decade working on a few original games such as "Soldier of Fortune", as well as licensed games, including the "Star Wars" games ' (2002) and ' (2003) and the "X-Men" games "X-Men Legends" (2004) and ' (2006). By 2009, the company had three development teams, and released the licensed game "Wolfenstein" (2009) while working on their first original game since 2002, "Singularity" (2010). Both "Wolfenstein" and "Singularity" sold poorly, however, and Raven laid off employees after each game, consolidating into a single development team by October 2010, shortly after "Singularity"s release. Following the layoffs, Raven focused exclusively as an assistant developer for the "Call of Duty" series, which has the position of lead developer rotate between Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games. Raven was the primary developer on two games since then: the China-exclusive "Call of Duty Online" (2015) and ' (2016), a remake of the 2007 ' packaged with '.

Lauw-Sim-Zecha family

The Lauw-Sim-Zecha family is an Indonesian family of mixed Peranakan Chinese and Indo-Bohemian descent that came to prominence at the start of the nineteenth century as "Pachters" (revenue farmers), "Landheeren" (landlords) and mandarins in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Sukabumi, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). The family formed part of the so-called 'Cabang Atas', or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia.
Origin and rise.
Lauw Ho, the founding father of the family, was a prominent "pachter" or revenue farmer in Batavia between 1845 and 1861, as well as one of the city's wealthiest tycoons. He was also part of the powerful Ngo Ho Tjiang partnership that dominated the opium monopoly in Batavia. He served as "Wijkmeester" (ward master) of Meester Cornelis, a junior position in the civil bureaucracy.
While Lauw Ho failed to secure an elevation to the prestigious Chinese officership, which was a high-ranking civil government post, his two sons – Lauw Tek Kang and Lauw Tek Lok (died in 1887) – were both appointed "Luitenants der Chinezen" of Meester Cornelis and Bekasi respectively on December 23, 1854. They also became important "Landheeren" or landlords through their acquisition of significant agricultural landholdings ('particuliere landen') in the "Ommelanden" or rural hinterland of Batavia, including the estate of Tjimanggis (now Cimanggis). The brothers' acquisition of Chinese lieutenancies and landed estates marked their entry into the ranks of the Cabang Atas.
Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok, who served in office with distinction until his death in 1882, nonetheless caused some consternation among the colonial authorities due to his unconventional, interracial marriage with an Indo-Bohemian woman, Louisa Zecha. On being widowed in 1882, Zecha further scandalized colonial society by marrying her dead husband's former private secretary-turned-magnate Sim Keng Koen, who later had a distinguished government career as the first "Kapitein der Chinezen" of Sukabumi, a colonial hill station in the Preanger highlands of West Java. As the historian Mely G. Tan notes, the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family lived in a grand style as the premier gentry family of Sukabumi, where most of the extended clan settled down.
Later history.
Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok and Louisa Zecha's grandson, Aristide William Lauw-Zecha, became the first Indonesian-born graduate of an American university (Iowa University in 1923), and was a prominent plantation owner. Kapitein Sim Keng Koen and Louisa Zecha's youngest son, Chester Lauw-Sim-Zecha, was also an important community and business leader, as well as a Freemason, in the first half of the twentieth century. The family, however, lost their vast landholdings and assets due to the Indonesian Revolution (1945-1950) and President Sukarno's nationalization of private landed estates in 1952.
In the aftermath of the revolution, many members of the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, like other scions of the Cabang Atas, left Indonesia and settled overseas. Notable members of the family today include the Malaysian royal Che Engku Chesterina (née Lauw-Sim-Zecha) and her cousin, Adrian Lauw-Zecha, son of A. W. Lauw-Zecha and the founder of Aman Resorts. Lauw-Zecha's son, Ajai, is married to the Singaporean actress Michelle Saram.

Georgy Baevsky

Georgy Arturovich Baevsky (; 11 July 1921 6 May 2005) was a flying ace in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division during the Second World War who was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 4 February 1944 and later went on to become a test pilot and major general of the Soviet Air Force.
Early life.
Baevsky was born on 11 July 1921 to a Russian family in Rostov-on-Don in the Russian SFSR. His father, Abram Baevsky, was a Soviet intelligence officer who lived under the pseudonym Artur and worked in the cinema industry. Georgy started attending school in Moscow in 1929 but not for long because his family moved to Germany. He became fluent in German during the three years he lived there before the family relocated again, to Sweden. In 1937 the family returned to Russia, settling in Moscow where Georgi began his aviation career at the flight club when he was a teenager before entering flight school.
Military career.
Baevsky joined the military in May 1940 after graduating from the Dzerzhinsky Aeroclub flight school in 1939. In November 1940 Baevsky was promoted to the rank of junior lieutenant and assigned as a flight instructor to the Serpukhov flight school. In 1941 he was transferred to the Chkalov Central Aeroclub in Northwest Moscow where he worked until he was sent to the front in April 1943 in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 1st Guards Mixed Aviation Corps of the 17th Air Army. His first experience of aerial combat was with a Bf 109 on 27 April 1943. During the war he participated in aerial combat in the Battles for Berlin, Kursk, Dnieper, and Warsaw; by December 1943 he had completed 144 combat sorties and was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union which he received on 4 February 1944. By the end of the war he had completed 252 sorties in 52 different aerial battles, for which he became flying ace for having personally shot down 19 enemy aircraft in total while flying a Lavochkin La-5.
After the war Baevsky attended the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy and became a test pilot for the air force after graduating, starting his job at the Chkalov Air Force Test Center in 1951 where he worked until entering the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia which he graduated in 1962. In his career as a test pilot he became a skilled pilot of 77 different aircraft types and was heavily involved in the testing of the MiG-25 in Egypt. By the time he retired from the military in 1985 he had risen to the rank of Major-General and had become the Deputy Chief of the Zhukovsky Academy where he had previously been a student.
Later life.
After leaving the military Baevskyserved as the chairman of the council of veterans of the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. He died in Moscow on 6 May 2005 and was buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

Ferrovia Alta Valtellina

The Ferrovia Alta Valtellina (FAV) is a railway line in Italy which connects Sondrio, in Valtellina, to Tirano in Alta Valtellina (Upper Tellina Valley). The railway company was established in 1899 and the line opened in 1902. Many railways in Italy were nationalized in 1905 but the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina escaped and was not nationalized until 1970.
History.
In 1899 a company was established for the Alta Valtellina Railway (FAV) with the aim of connecting Sondrio with Tirano. It obtained the concession in August of the same year and started construction work. The line, called the Alta Valtellina, was a natural continuation of the Valtellina Line (Sondrio-Lecco) and the service was inaugurated on 29 June 1902. Initially it was operated by steam traction using four Henschel steam locomotives. Numbers 1-3 were 0-4-0T and number 4 was a 0-6-0T of the Prussian T 3 type. Three more Prussian T 3s, numbers 5-7, arrived later. FAV No.6 is preserved.
On 1 July 1908, the Tirano-St.Moritz line was activated by the Swiss private company Berninabahn (now part of the Rhaetian Railway) which allowed the connection of the Upper Tellina Valley with the Swiss slopes of the region.
Electrification.
In 1932 the line was electrified using the same three-phase system as the Ferrovia della Valtellina. Four electric locomotives were used and they became FAV Class E.440. Numbers 1-3 were built by Costruzioni Elettro Meccaniche di Saronno (CEMSA). Number 4 was built by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB). 
In 1967, due to the declining popularity of three-phase traction, the line was de-electrified and operated by diesel-powered trains of type ALn 556 chartered from Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (FS). In 1970, the line was nationalized and became part of the FS network. On 29 May 1980, electric traction was re-introduced using the 3 kV direct current system. From 1981 the first direct trains from Milan to Tirano were established.
Upgrade programme.
In the mid-1980s, the line was the subject of a larger programme to upgrade the route from Milan for a cost of about 100 billion lire, which involved the activation of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) between Sondrio and Tirano, with a Central Manager in Colico. As part of this plan, in 1986 the stations of Chiuro, San Giacomo di Teglio, Bianzone and Villa di Tirano were downgraded to halts.
Service reduction.
Since 2008, train services have been progressively reduced from 19 to 13, and in June 2014 there was a further reduction. Currently, there are 9 daily services.

Fredericka Douglass Sprague Perry

Fredericka Douglass Sprague Perry (1872 – October 23, 1943) was an American philanthropist and activist. Perry founded the Colored Big Sister Home for Girls in 1934 in Kansas City, Missouri. With her husband, John E. Perry, she worked to provide better health care to African-American children.
Early life and education.
Perry was born in Rochester, New York, in 1872. She was the daughter of Rosetta Douglass and granddaughter of Frederick Douglass She was the fifth oldest child of the seven children of Rosetta Douglass Sprague and Nathan Sprague. She attended public school in Washington, DC, and then the Mechanics Institute in Rochester, New York.

In 1906, she moved to Missouri, where she taught home economics at Lincoln University in Jefferson City. After her marriage to Dr. John E. Perry in 1912, founder of the Wheatley Provident Hospital (previously called the Perry Sanitarium), the first private hospital for Black people in Kansas City, she moved to Kansas City to work with her husband at the hospital. 
Perry became involved in the African-American women's clubs movement. Perry had been a juvenile court worker, and she was specifically concerned with rectifying the harsh treatment of dependent adolescent children of color who were often placed in a state institution for juvenile delinquents until they reached their majority. In 1923, she initiated the formation of the Missouri State Association of Colored Girls, sponsored by the senior women’s association; Kansas City was one of the first cities to have such a group.
In 1934, with the help of Kansas City Federation of Colored Women’s Club, she founded the Colored Big Sister Home for Girls.

Lid tectonics

Lid tectonics, commonly thought of as stagnant lid tectonics, is the type of tectonics that is believed to exist on several planets and moons in the Solar System, and possibly existed on Earth during the early part of its history. The lid is the equivalent of the lithosphere in plate tectonics, formed of solid silicate minerals (or solid ice in the case of icy planets and moons). The relative stability and immobility of the strong cooler lids leads to stagnant lid tectonics, which has greatly reduced amounts of horizontal tectonics compared with plate tectonics (which can also be described as mobile lid tectonics). The presence of a stagnant lid above a convecting mantle was recognised as a possible stable regime for convection on Earth, in contrast to the well-attested mobile plate tectonics of the current eon.
Formation.
A lid tectonic regime arises when the cold upper lithosphere is too viscous to participate in the underlying flow of the mantle. The lid's yield strength is high enough where the lid cannot brittlely fail. This relationship relies heavily on the ratio of lithospheric strength to natural convective stresses. Hence, if lithospheric strength is greater than convective stresses, then there are stagnant lid tectonics.
Factors contributing to lid tectonics.
Many characteristics of a planetary body influence the presence and degree of lid tectonics. The temperature of a body's core–mantle boundary, and the presence of water, strongly affect the rheological, composition, and thermal diagnostics of lid tectonics.
The lid will not participate in the underlying convection of the mantle. At the base of the lithosphere, where the lid is in contact with less viscous material, melts will form at the thermal boundary layer and cause drips, believed to be of peridotite composition. This stagnant lid regime will not effectively mix a mantle.
Other planetary bodies.
Stagnant lid regime is the most common type of plate tectonics style that exists in the solar system. Mercury, the Moon, Venus, and Io are all believed to have been dominated by lid tectonics for their entire history. In the mantle of both Mercury and the Moon, heat is mainly lost by conduction across the lid, leading to low heat flows. Solomatov and Moresi coined the term "stagnant lid" when they characterized the tectonic style that was present on Venus in 1996. They stated that Venus had plumes similar to Earth, that would rise to the surface, and cold "drips" of lithosphere would sink back down. Mars is also believed to have stagnant lid tectonics, albeit, much slower in comparison to Venus.

Arch Mission Foundation

Arch Mission Foundation is a non-profit organization whose goal is to create multiple redundant repositories of human knowledge around the Solar System, including on Earth. It maintains a backup of planet Earth. The organization was founded by Nova Spivack and Nick Slavin in 2015 and incorporated in 2016.
In 2019, the Arch Mission sent the Lunar Library, a 30 million page library of books, data, images and a copy of English Wikipedia to the Moon inside the Israeli "Beresheet" moon lander. The Lunar Library was also rumored to contain an unannounced microscopic sample of tardigrades, a form of life that can go into suspended animation and survive in space. Spivack was called a "space pirate" who contaminated the Moon, while some scientists argued that tardigrades were already present there. The Lunar Library also contains several vaults of secret content, one of which is David Copperfield's magic secrets, a secret recipe of queso, a microscopic shrine including relics and spiritual texts and a sample of the Bodhi leaf from India.
The Arch Mission plans to deliver multiple backups of civilization to locations around the Solar System as part of a distributed backup strategy.
Project.
The foundation plans "multiple...Arch libraries intended to preserve and disseminate humanity's knowledge across time and space for the benefit of future generations". The foundation is technology agnostic and will use whichever storage technology is best for its purposes including multiple technologies. The first method used is "5D laser optical data storage in quartz", which will reportedly remain readable for up to 14 billion years, resist cosmic radiation, and can withstand temperatures up to 1,000°C. The foundation also plans on spinning off companies based on patents from research groups involved with the technologies it uses to fund itself in the future.
Data Archives.
Arch disks 1 through 5.
As a proof of concept of the 5D optical data storage technology, Arch made 5 disks each containing Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" trilogy comprising about 3 megabytes each. The disks were created by Peter Kazansky at the University of Southampton's Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC), the inventor of the 5D optical data storage technology and who is on Arch Mission Foundation's "Science and Technology Council". The discs are considered the longest-lasting storage objects ever created by humans.
Solar Library.
In December 2017, when Arch co-founder Nova Spivack heard that SpaceX was launching a Tesla into space, Spivack tweeted to Musk who jumped at the opportunity to include one on the mission - Musk was a book fan. Musk was also given the 1.1 disk for his private library. The 1.2 disk, named the 'Solar Library' by the Arch Mission Foundation also represents the first permanent space library, and is projected to orbit around the Sun for at least a few million years. The Solar Library was launched on the SpaceX Falcon Heavy test flight on February 6, 2018, inside Musk's red Tesla Roadster. The payload was placed in an elliptical orbit that extends nearly 243 million miles from the Sun at its farthest point.
Other projects.
Arch hopes to seed the Solar System with millions and possibly billions of archives into "all kinds of locations". It wants to build a permanent library on the Moon and on Mars. Arch envisions its small light-weight disks might be an alternative means of moving large amounts of data between Earth and Mars as opposed to radio signals. Longer term they envision connecting the Arch Libraries through a decentralised read-write data sharing network that spans the Solar System.
Data in the libraries will include Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, human genomes and other large open-data sets. They will also allow donations of money to instruct that certain data be included, and will do so without censorship of what can be included. The foundation cites the likelihood that a being developed enough to find and read the information would already possess significant technology as the reason for not prioritizing scientific data sets.
In February 2018, the Arch Mission successfully placed an archive called the Orbital Library, which contains a copy of Wikipedia, into low-Earth orbit. The Arch Mission has also built a payload called the Lunar Library, which serves as a backup to planet Earth and contains scientific, cultural and historical information in almost 30 languages and several encyclopedias including Wikipedia. The Lunar Library was set to arrive on the Moon on the Israeli spacecraft "Beresheet", but it crashed landed on the Moon in May 2019. Despite this, the 30-million page Lunar Library possibly survived due to the strength of its construction.
In 2021, Arch Mission announced partnerships with Astrobotic Technology and Galactic Legacy Labs for several return missions to the Moon such as a second attempt to deliver the Lunar Library and for consumers to land their personal memories and photos on the Moon.

Erich Prigge

Erich Prigge (1878–1955) was a German army officer, who served in both the German Imperial Army and the Ottoman Army during World War I, and ultimately attained the rank of Major. Prigge is best known as the long-serving adjutant to General Otto Liman von Sanders (1914–19) and as a military memoirist.
Erich Richard Julius Prigge was born on 19 March 1878 at Harsefeld in the Prussian Province of Hanover. His parents were from bourgeois families of the Rhine Province, distinguished in business and provincial administration. He was primarily raised by paternal relatives in Magdeburg. He was a cousin once removed of René König.
Military career.
Education and pre-WWI years.
Destined for a military career from an early age, Prigge attended a regional cadet school (Kadettenschule), followed by two years’ instruction (1894-6) at the Central Cadet Institution (Hauptkadettenanstalt) at Groß-Lichterfelde. In 1896 he was posted to the 2. Rheinisches Husaren-Regiment Nr. 9, stationed at Trier, later relocated to Strassburg. Following a mandatory course at a War School (Kriegsschule), in 1897 he received his commission as Sekondelieutenant. In 1904-6 he was posted to the Military Riding Institute () in Hanover. Thereafter he served as an inspection officer (Inspektionsoffizier) at the War Schools in Neisse and Glogau. He was promoted to Oberleutnant on 1908 and transferred to the War School in Potsdam, where he served as a riding instructor (Reitlehrer). In January 1913 he was promoted to Rittmeister and transferred to the Ulanen-Regiment von Schmidt (1. Pommersches) Nr. 4, based at Thorn.
In February 1914 Prigge retired from active duty in the Prussian Army prior to his transferral to the German Military Mission (Militärmission) to the Ottoman Empire. On arrival in Istanbul, he was appointed commanding officer of the Ottoman Cavalry Non-Commissioned Officers’ School at Ayazağa. As a Rittmeister in the Prussian army, he was accorded the one-higher rank of Binbaşı (Major) in the Ottoman Army.
First World War.
On the outbreak of World War I in Europe in August 1914, Prigge was appointed as an adjutant to General Liman von Sanders, a post he retained, with brief interruptions, until the end of the war. After Liman von Sanders was appointed commander-in-chief of the newly created Ottoman Fifth Army in March 1915, Prigge served at its headquarters on the Gallipoli Peninsula throughout the Dardanelles campaign. In May 1915 he was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class). In September 1915 he was instructed to write a semi-official account of the fighting, primarily to counter British propaganda. Completed even before the conclusion of combat operations, and based partly of personal observation, partly on official documentation and eyewitness reports, this narrative was published at the beginning of 1916 as "Der Kampf um die Dardanellen" ("The Struggle for the Dardanelles"). It is as one of the earliest published accounts of the campaign written by a combatant. After a few months on sale in Germany, a complaint from the Ottoman General Headquarters that its content compromised military security induced the German authorities to order the book’s confiscation. Later in 1916, a revised and expurgated version of Prigge’s text was anonymously published as "Gallipoli, der Kampf um den Orient" ("Gallipoli, the Struggle for the Orient"), attributed to 'an officer of the staff of Marshal Liman von Sanders'. Subsequently, Prigge remained with Liman von Sanders as his adjutant until 1919, apart from a tenth-month secondment to the Eastern Front in 1917. His final theatre of operations was in Palestine, where Liman von Sanders commanded the Yıldırım Army Group (1 March-30 October 1918). In April 1918 Prigge was promoted to Major temporarily without commission in the Prussian army, and correspondingly ranked as Kaymakam (Oberstleutnant) in the Ottoman Army. During the final phase of the campaign, he briefly served as acting chief of staff to the Army Group.
Interbellum.
Following the Armistice of Mudros, Prigge returned to Germany in early 1919 and retired from the army with the rank of Major (ret.). He resided in Berlin, where he married and pursued diverse business interests. He was a member of the Bund der Asienkämpfer, later serving as its vice-chairman (c.1932-4). He remained well connected in political-military circles and participated in diplomatic activities involving the Republic of Turkey and Balkan countries.
WWII and after.
During World War II he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht as a reserve officer (1940–44) and exercised various administrative functions in Baden. After the war, he became managing director of the Badisches Hilfswerk and subsequently of the Red Cross in Baden. He died at Locarno on 1 February 1955.

John Jairo Arias Tascón 'Pinina'

John Jairo Arias Tascón (1961 – 13 June 1990), known as Pinina, was a member of the Medellín Cartel. He obtained power in the cartel's military wing and was accused of hundreds of murders. He was considered to be ranked fifth within the cartel structure. He was a hit man, the boss of hit men and leader of a criminal group at the disposal of the Cartel, known as Los Priscos.
His strident voice caused him to be nicknamed "Pinina". He was tall. Few photos of him are available.
Career.
As a child, Arias lived in the Medellin commune, in the barrio (quarter) Lovaina. He was born to a poor family. He became a thief at twelve, then joined a gang and finally became a hit man at age 15. One story holds that one day he went to a park near San Pedro cemetery, where he stole a music player from a car that belonged to Pablo Escobar. One of Pablo's men started asking around and found that Arias had broken into the car. He informed Pablo Escobar of the feat. Escobar then asked Pinina to be a member of the cartel.
Arias had a vast knowledge of the people in the commune, which allowed him to recruit members for murder-for-hire. The first assassination ordered by the Medellín Cartel, i.e., the assassination of Rodrigo Lara, was delegated to him. He then hired Byron de Jesús Velásquez, Iván Darío Guizao Álvarez and others to commit the assassination in 1984. Pinina participated in almost every criminal act ordered by the cartel: the assassinations of Lara and El Espectador director Guillermo Cano Isaza in 1986, the bombing of the El Espectador building in 1989, the assassination of Police Colonel Jaime Ramírez Gómez in 1986, the kidnap and murder of Carlos Mauro Hoyos in 1988, the murder of the Antioquia governor Antonio Roldán Betancur in 1989, the assassination of the Police Colonel Valdemar Franklin Quintero in 1989, cooperation with the arrangement of the DAS Building bombing in 1989 (leaving 52 dead and at least 600 wounded), involvement in the bombing of an Avianca airplane on 27 November 1989 (110 people killed), participation in the killing of many police officers as well as the assassination of the magistrate of Colombian Supreme Court Hernando Baquero Borda in 1986, participation in the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán in 1989 and the war between the Medellin Cartel and the Cali Cartel along with other criminal acts such as car bombings.
Death.
Arias died on 13 June 1990, when the Colombian police raided his apartment in the neighborhood, El Poblado of Medellín. He tried to escape through a window on the third floor, but fell, injuring his ankle, head and right arm. He was able to stand up and tried to walk to his car, but upon encountering the police, he retreated into the apartment building. On the first floor he engaged in a fight with police officers and was eventually killed. He was 29 years old at the time of his death. After his death, the Medellín Cartel started to fall apart. In retaliation, Escobar ordered his men to drive a car-bomb into the police station of El Poblado, causing severe damage. His body was buried in cemetery in Medellín.
Media.
In 2012, Caracol Televisión premiered the series "Pablo Escobar, The Drug Lord", inspired by the life of the cartel chief. In it, the character of John Jairo Arias was portrayed using the alias "El Chili".
In 2013, RCN Televisión premiered the series "Tres Caínes" (produced by RTI Producciones), where is mentioned under the alias "Pepino".
In the series "Bloque de búsqueda", produced by Teleset for Sony Pictures Television, broadcast in 2016 and inspired by the police force that disbanded the Medellín Cartel, his character was performed by the actor Sebastián Boscán, under the alias "Pinocho".

Memory, the Heart

Memory, the Heart, a 1937 painting by Frida Kahlo, depicts the pain and anguish Kahlo experienced during and after an affair between her husband, artist Diego Rivera, and her sister, Cristina Kahlo.
The painting is sometimes known by the title Recuerdo (Memory). The oil-on-metal work measures 40 x 28 cm, and is held in the collection of Michel Petitjean in Paris, France.
Description.
Kahlo portrays herself standing on a beach by the water's edge, one foot on the sand and one in the sea, looking towards the viewer with an expressionless face covered in tears. A metal rod goes through a large empty space in her chest. The rod has an image of Cupid at each end, shown as if riding a seesaw. Frida's heart is represented by a large bleeding mutilated organ lying outside her body. The blood from the heart seeps into the sand and flows into the sea. Two dresses, one a schoolgirl dress, the other her traditional Tehuantepec-style costume, hang near Frida; not empty, they contain one human arm apiece. The schoolgirl dress arm reaches for but does not touch Frida, while the arm in the Tehauna dress supports the armless and immobile artist.
These symbols and others in the painting show the artist's immense pain, and her personal emotional damage and rebuilding, resulting from the affair between her sister and husband.

Al Hudaydah offensive

Al Hudaydah offensive, also called western coast offensive (), describes the offensive launched in December 2017 by pro-government forces against the Houthis in Al Hudaydah Governorate as part of Yemen's 2015 civil war. As of December 2018, the pro-government forces have captured the towns of Al Khawkhah, Hays, At Tuhayta, and brokered a ceasefire in Al Hudaydah City.
Course of events.

Impolite (film)

Impolite is a Canadian mystery film, directed by David Hauka and released in 1992. The film stars Robert Wisden as Jack Yeats, a burned-out journalist who is investigating the death of wealthy businessman Naples O'Rorke (Christopher Plummer).
The cast also includes Suzy Joachim, Kevin McNulty, Stuart Margolin, Jill Teed, Susan Hogan, Timothy Webber and Katherine Banwell.
The film premiered at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival.
Reception.
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Rick Groen of "The Globe and Mail" called it more a work in progress than an accomplished film, writing that "At best, the references form an organic part of the plot, and give the deathly puzzle an epistemological kick ("Truth is a matter of opinion," someone mutters). At worst, they're a bit show-offy and sophomoric, like listening to a bunch of sherry-sippers in an undergraduate common room. The same highs and lows can be seen in McKinley's working out of the mystery itself - the resolution is opaque, with a lot of loose ends, some of which seem deliberate and provocatively murky, others of which seem accidental and confusingly shoddy." Katherine Monk of the "Vancouver Sun" wrote that "At times Impolite is so well-read, it can lose you in its quickness - like a Stoppard play that thrives on inside intelligentsia jokes. (Here, at least all the inside jokes are Canadian.) At other times, it can have you scratching your head in search of a linear through-line the way Lynch is apt to do, and other times, heck, it feels as down home as an episode of the Beachcombers."
Plummer received a Genie Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 14th Genie Awards in 1993.

2018 Dutch municipal elections

The Dutch municipal elections of 2018 were held on 21 March in 335 municipalities in the Netherlands. This election determined the composition of the municipal councils for the following four years. The election coincided with the Intelligence and Security Services Act referendum.
Background.
In the previous municipal elections, local political parties won by far most votes and seats. Nationally, all local political parties won 28% of the votes and a third of municipal council seats. Local parties have seen a steady rise since the 1990s. In 2018, Vlieland will be the only municipality in which no national political parties will contest the election.
Of all national political parties, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) will contest most municipal elections; the party will be on the ballot in all but three (Rozendaal, Vlieland and Schiermonnikoog). The Labour Party (PvdA) comes second, contesting over 320 elections, albeit on a joint list with allied parties in some municipalities. The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) will participate in over 315 elections, and the Democrats 66 in over 270, followed by GroenLinks in 220, the Christian Union in 169, the Socialist Party in 118 and the Reformed Political Party (SGP) in 99.
The Party for Freedom (PVV), which had previously only participated in The Hague and Almere, initially planned to expand to a total of sixty municipalities, but has only been able to find suitable candidates in thirty, including Rotterdam. 50PLUS will expand to twenty municipalities, while the Party for the Animals (PvdD) will contest fifteen elections. Two new national political parties will make their entrance to municipal politics. Denk will contest the elections in fourteen municipalities, while the Forum for Democracy will only contest in Amsterdam. Additionally, the latter has endorsed the local party Livable Rotterdam.
45 municipalities did not have elections on 21 March due to mergers.
Electoral system.
Municipal councils are elected using party-list proportional representation. The number of seats depends on the population of the municipality, ranging from nine seats for municipalities with a population below 3,000, to 45 seats for municipalities with a population over 200,000.
Amsterdam.
Results.
After the 2018 municipal elections, the GroenLinks held the largest share of seats on the municipal council, though not enough to hold a majority. As no party held a majority, a left-leaning governing coalition was formed between GroenLinks, D66, the Labour Party, and the Socialist Party, which together hold 26 of the city's 45 council seats. 
The new city council elected Femke Halsema, a member of the GroenLinks, to be the mayor of Amsterdam. Halsema is the first women to be elected mayor of Amsterdam, as well as the first member of the GroenLinks to take that position.

The Personal History of David Copperfield is a 2019 comedy-drama film written and directed by Armando Iannucci, based on the 1850 Victorian era novel "David Copperfield" by Charles Dickens. It stars Dev Patel as the title character, along with Aneurin Barnard, Peter Capaldi, Morfydd Clark, Daisy May Cooper, Rosalind Eleazar, Hugh Laurie, Tilda Swinton, Ben Whishaw and Paul Whitehouse.
The world premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September 2019. It was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2020 by Lionsgate UK and in the United States on 28 August 2020 by Searchlight Pictures.
Plot.
David Copperfield is born to his mother Clara, who was widowed before her son's birth. He has an idyllic life. David visits the family of his nanny Peggotty in their (upturned) boathouse in Yarmouth as a child. When he returns, he finds out Clara has married the sinister and cruel Mr. Murdstone. David is bullied by his new stepfather and step-aunt. When Murdstone harasses Clara, David tries to defend her, but is beaten by Murdstone, who sends him to work in Murdstone's factory in London where he lodges with the Micawbers, who are pursued by their creditors. 
A few years later, David is now a young man still working at Murdstone's factory. He has been jotting quotes by people important in his life down on pieces of paper. The Micawbers are driven out of their house by bailiffs, who also seize their possessions. David is told of his mother's death and funeral, wreaks havoc in the factory, and finding out that his aunt Betsey Trotwood is his only living relative, goes back to Dover where he finds his wealthy aunt and her lodger, the eccentric Mr. Dick, who has an obsession with King Charles I's head. He thinks that when Charles was executed, the King's troubled thoughts took up residence in his own mind. He, like David, jots them down on pieces of paper.
David helps Mr. Dick clear his mind by transferring these papers to a kite which Mr Dick then flies. David also meets Mr. Wickfield, Betsey's accountant, and his daughter Agnes. To continue his studies, David is admitted to a school for boys, where he meets James Steerforth. David has a boxing match with a local thug who mocks him and Steerforth, and is knocked out in two punches, knowing almost nothing about boxing. Wickfield's clerk Uriah Heep invites him for tea with his mother. Mr. Micawber briefly joins the school as a teacher, but is exposed by Steerforth and is shown the door.
David goes to Uriah's house for tea, as he had promised a few days earlier. Uriah tries to blackmail him with the knowledge he gained of David's past. Later, David finds out Uriah has been hired as an assistant to Mr. Wickfield at his firm and is attempting to court Agnes. There is a farewell party at the boys' school, where David meets Steerforth's mother and a girl named Dora Spenlow, whom he falls in love with. He is hired as a trainee lawyer in Mr Spenlow's law firm in London. There he lives the life of a 'young gentleman', and courts Dora. 
His aunt Betsey turns up unexpectedly at his London lodgings with Mr. Dick: she tells him she has been ruined, and they all decamp to a slum dwelling. David visits Pegotty's house with Steerforth. Pegotty's adopted daughter Emily runs away with Steerforth, leaving her fiancé and childhood 'brother' Ham. Mr. Micawber is now living on the streets with his family and has pawned his concertina, which he asks Mr. Dick to buy back. However, when Mr. Dick is given a price of a pound for the concertina, he tricks the shopkeeper and steals it. The Micawbers are then given shelter by Betsey Trotwood and Mr. Dick.
Agnes tells David, Micawber, Betsey, and Mr. Dick that she wants a letter written by Mr. Wickfield to use as evidence against Uriah, who she knows is doing something corrupt. David, Agnes and others confront Uriah, who had been embezzling funds from the firm by forging Mr. Wickfield's signature on documents. One of these had robbed Betsey Trotwood of her fortune. Wickfield then dismisses Uriah from his firm. Dora calls off her engagement with David, asking him to write her out of his book. Emily, who had run away with James Steerforth, is spotted in London by the Pegotty family. She tells them and David that Steerforth had abandoned her in France, but would return the following day to Yarmouth. 
There is a storm at sea and the boat with Steerforth is about to be wrecked on the Yarmouth beach. Ham swims out to it on a line, but Steerforth refuses to be rescued and is drowned. Emily and Mrs. Steerforth mourn his death and David realises he is in love with Agnes. David finishes writing his book. It is published, and is a great success, critically and financially. David buys the house back, Betsey and Mr. Dick move back into it, Mr. Micawber appears to have acquired some form of financial stability, and David and Agnes are married and have a daughter.

Uncle Drew

Uncle Drew is a 2018 American sports comedy film directed by Charles Stone III and written by Jake Kroell. It stars Kyrie Irving as the title character from his Pepsi Max advertisements that began airing in 2012, along with former NBA players Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Webber, Aaron Gordon, Reggie Miller, and Nate Robinson, as well as former WNBA player Lisa Leslie. Lil Rel Howery, Erica Ash, J. B. Smoove, Mike Epps, Tiffany Haddish, and Nick Kroll also star.
The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate on June 29, 2018, and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast, but called the direction and screenplay "formulaic".
Plot.
The film opens with a documentary-style overview of Uncle Drew, a well-remembered basketball legend who was supposed to play in the Rucker Classic. However, due to an unknown conflict, he and his team disappeared. In the present, Dax Winslow is the underappreciated coach of the Harlem Money and their star player, Casper Jones. Dax spends lavishly to keep both his girlfriend, Jess, and Casper happy, despite being a clerk at Foot Locker. During practice Mookie Bass, an old rival of Dax's, arrives and taunts him about the upcoming Rucker Classic tournament. In a dream sequence, it is revealed that Dax was an orphan who planned on becoming a basketball player, but was humiliated by Mookie after he had a shot blocked by him in their youth. The next day at work Casper demands expensive new shoes from Dax, who effectively bankrupts himself purchasing them. Despite this, Mookie successfully recruits Casper and the rest of Dax's team away from him, leading to a confrontation involving Dax forcibly trying to remove Casper's shoes that is filmed and shown on ESPN. Due to this humiliation, Dax's girlfriend Jess dumps him and kicks him out of her apartment.
Dejected, Dax has little luck finding players for a new team until the cantankerous Angelo encourages him to seek out Uncle Drew. Drew turns out to be an exceptional basketball player despite his old age. After seeing a demonstration of Drew's prowess, Dax recruits him for the team, neglecting to inform him about the tournament's prize money. Drew agrees to join Dax under the condition that they recruit his original teammates.
They set off in Drew's van and recruit Preacher, who has since become an actual preacher, but incur the wrath of his wife Betty Lou who pursues them as they leave town. They next reunite with the partially blind Lights and the wheelchair bound Boots whose granddaughter, Maya, volunteers at the nursing home looking after them. They escape and make it to the karate dojo of Big Fella. Big Fella is reluctant to join the team, as he still holds a grudge against Drew, but Dax persuades him to join. After his credit card is declined at a gas station, Dax attempts to hustle the coach of a youth girls basketball team to earn money for fuel. Dax's team loses, but Drew offers up the money to help Dax after learning the real motive for the game, and Maya begins to appreciate him for the way he treats the elders.
Returning to Rucker Park, Drew gives each member of his team gear that restores their faith and abilities, but Big Fella still refuses to cooperate with Drew. During the team's first game in the tournament Big Fella and Drew tussle on the court, almost costing them the win. Eventually, Drew acknowledges his mistake: sleeping with Big Fella's now deceased wife before the big game. He admits that he too loved her and the two make amends.
Meanwhile, Dax learns that Mookie and Jess are dating, and begins falling for Maya. After learning about the tournament's prize money from Angelo and realizing he was misled, Drew angrily confronts Dax. Dax confides in him about his past with Mookie, causing Drew to forgive him. While playing in the semi-finals, Big Fella suddenly has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital. Betty Lou arrives but instead of chastising Preacher, she agrees to fill in as the team's fifth member.
Dax and his team, now renamed the Harlem Buckets, play against Mookie's team in the finals who are an even match for them. Late in the game Lights and Casper collide and are both injured, forcing Dax and Mookie to fill in. Dax still lacks self-confidence, but his teammates give him the advice he needs and he manages to make the game-winning shot, beating Mookie and earning everyone's respect. Returning to the hospital the team reunite with Big Fella, Dax uses the prize money to pay his medical bills, and ESPN now hails Dax as a hero.
During the credits Jess is shown trying to call Dax about getting back together, becoming increasingly distraught when he does not answer.

Critical response.
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 84 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Kyrie Irving's crossover to comedy is amiable enough to score with basketball fans, but "Uncle Drew" is held back by formulaic direction and too much product placement." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews." Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.
David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a "B–" and wrote: "At heart, "Uncle Drew" is a personality-driven film. The plot is spare, and the storytelling gets super janky whenever screenwriter Jay Longino is asked to manufacture a new obstacle. But as wince-inducing as it can be to watch the film stall for time, or use the Rucker prize money to muster up some hollow conflict, the climactic streetball showdown pays off." "Variety"s Peter Debtuge praised the performances of the NBA players and makeup, while saying the film is never that surprising or funny, writing, "While it won't increase your appetite for zero-calorie sugar water one bit (oddly enough, Nike gets far more prominent on-screen placement), this affectionate basketball-themed comedy from sports-savvy director Charles Stone III comes across as an effective feature-length ad for the game itself."
"Uncle Drew" PepsiMax advertisements.
In 2012, PepsiCo embarked on an internet-based advertising campaign for Pepsi Max with the character "Uncle Drew" played by Kyrie Irving. The first advertisement was conceived as being in the form of a short film rather than an explicit commercial. During the advertising campaign, some of the shorts were edited down to 30 second segments which appeared both online and on television. The original short was wildly popular; it was reported to be the second most watched "advertisement" on YouTube that year and among the 50 most-viewed viral videos worldwide, garnering more than 22 million views. PepsiCo and its advertising agency Davie Brown Entertainment quickly rolled out another commercial, "Uncle Drew: Chapter 2", this time co-starring future NBA teammate Kevin Love and opening with an extended cameo by basketball legend Bill Russell. Over the next few years two more chapters followed, including NBA and WNBA stars Maya Moore, Nate Robinson, Ray Allen, Baron Davis, and J.B. Smoove. Some of these players appeared in the 2018 feature length movie. Each chapter ranged between 5 to 7 minutes in length. Collectively they received over 118 million views by mid 2020 on YouTube. 
The intention of these shorts was to form the backbone of an advertising campaign but Pepsi decided not to be heavy handed with the product. Marc Gilbar, then a creative director at Davie Brown, described how product placement was sufficient for their goals "[We] put a couple of barrel coolers of Pepsi MAX on the outside of the court. It was a warm night, and they were free, so people naturally started drinking it. In some places it may have felt like it was placed there, and it was, but the people weren't acting." PepsiCo also owns the Gatorade brand which can be seen in the shorts and feature films.
Kyrie Irving is credited as writer and director in these productions but that is inaccurate. He did develop the character's personality, improvised dialog, and blocked out a lot scenes. But in fact, Gilbar and the Davie Brown team created the Uncle Drew universe, makeup artist Ed French came up with the character's look, and Jonathan Klein directed. Klein was reported to give up credit to Irving to make the shorts seem more intriguing. Gilbar went on to be involved with the production of the 2018 feature length movie.

Salisediminibacterium

Salisediminibacterium is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria from the family of Bacillaceae. The type species is "Salisediminibacterium halotolerans."
"Salisediminibacterium" "beveridgei" and "Salisediminibacterium selenitireducens" were previously species belonging to "Bacillus", a genus that has been recognized as displaying extensive polyphyly and has been restricted by recent phylogenetic studies to only include species closely related to "Bacillus subtilis" and "Bacillus cereus." 
The name "Salisediminibacterium" is derived from the prefix "-salisedimini" (from the Latin noun "sal", which translates to "salt" and the Latin noun "sedimen," referring to sediment")," and the suffix "-bacterium" (from the Latin noun "bacterium", referring to a rod). Together, "Salisediminibacterium" translates to a rod from salt sediment.
Biochemical Characteristics and Molecular Signatures.
Cells are either non-spore formers or spore forming and are variably motile. Catalase and nitrate reduction activities are variable. Most species are halophilic and alkali-tolerant requiring a minimum of 1% (w/v) NaCl in the medium for growth to occur. "S. selenitireducens" demonstrates weak microaerophilic growth and anaerobic respiratory growth with Se(IV), As(V), nitrate, nitrite, trimethylamine oxide and fumarate as electron acceptors. 
Analyses of genome sequences from "Salisediminibacterium" species identified four conserved signature indels (CSIs) for this genus in the following proteins: insulinase family protein, alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase subunit beta, MBL fold metallo-hydrolase and excinuclease ABC subunit UvrA, which in most cases are exclusively shared by either all or most members of this genus. These CSIs provide a reliable method of identification and differentiation for this genus from other "Bacillaceae" genera and bacteria. 
Taxonomy.
"Salisediminibacterium", as of May 2021, contains a total of 5 species with validly published names. This branching pattern is also observed in the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB).
