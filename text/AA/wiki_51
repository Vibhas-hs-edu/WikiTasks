List of UK top-ten albums in 2018

The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical albums and digital downloads. Since 2015, the album chart has been based on both sales and streaming. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart during 2018, as well as albums which peaked in 2017 and 2019 but were in the top 10 in 2018. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).

Thirteen albums from 2017 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while "50 Years – Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac and "Unchained Melodies" by Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra were both released in 2018 but did not reach their peak until 2019. "Christmas" by "Michael Bublé" was originally released in 2011, launched a new chart run in 2017, reaching a peak on its latest run in 2018 and again in 2019.

Tertiary Hill Country

The Tertiary Hill Country ( or "Tertiäres Hügelland"), also called the Tertiary Hills, is an upland area with a moderate climate in the northern Alpine Foreland, which extends northwards as far as the River Danube. It is divided into two simple contiguous regions that are separated by the valley of the Lower Inn which itself is not usually counted as part of the Tertiary Hills. In Germany (Bavaria), the Lower Bavarian Upland is its larger northwestern element; in Upper Austria it forms the Hausruckviertl Mountain and Hill Country (also called the Upper Austrian Hill Country or "Oberösterreichisches Hügelland"). From a natural regional perspective, depending on the definition, it forms one or two 3rd level natural regions.
The Tertiary Hill Country is bordered to the west, south and southeast by old moraine gravel plateaux, that also form 3rd order major regions in the northern Alpine Foreland:

Regional Museum in Szczecinek

The Regional Museum in Szczecinek Poland was founded in 1914. From the beginning of the 1970s, the museum specialization was established in three main areas: the art collection regarding the history of the city and the entire West Pomerania, hunting, and goldsmithing. Archaeological collections (ceramics, jewelry, tools), regional collections (painting, sculpture - all related to the city and the region), hunting sets (more than 130 hunting objects: firearms and hand-to-hand combat, hunting gear, accessories and memorabilia for hunting salons), collection of gold artifacts. The most valuable objects are from the eighteenth century. The most known statue in the museum is a stone figure of a Slavic deity that is one of the oldest pieces on exhibition, called "Belbuk"
History.
The Regional Museum in Szczecinek dates to 1866 making it one of the oldest museums in Western Pomerania. The museum was created after an archaeological exhibition organized by Prussian major and cryptologist, Fryderyk Wilhelm Krasiski at the armory building (auxiliary formations of the Prussian army) located at the Kosciuszko Street. The exhibition consisted of objects found during excavations conducted by him, including the pile deposits discovered in Parsęca. Until 1881 (until Kasiski's death), the exhibition grew considerably and numbered 702 pieces. After his death the collection was sold and gave rise to the Ethnological Museum (germ. Ethnologisches Museum) in Berlin (Dahlem).
The museum was established half a century later when the historical interests were again enlivened by the ceremonial celebrations of the 600th anniversary of Szczecinek creation in 1910. In the autumn of 1913, mayor K. Sasse, established the Museum Society. The association members included well-known citizens of the city of Szczecinek: K. Tümpel, E. Wille, landrat (head of the county) Ernst von Hertzberg, and painter Paul Stubbe. Thanks to the association of the museum, the museum was established in June 1914, in the tower of St. Nicholas church (remains of the first Christian church in Szczecinek city). The pre-war collection was small but valuable. The works that were exhibited at the time documented the history of the city and of the region. The collection included, among others, the silver goblets donated by princess Ann (from 1606), and princess Jadwiga (from 1625).
The activity of the facility, however, was halted by the outbreak of World War I. Thanks to the efforts of Georg Zehm in 1935, the museum was moved to the castle (Zamek Książąt Pomorskich) in Szczecinek.
At the end of World War II, in February 1945, after the city was taken over by the Soviet army, part of the collection was thrown out of the window. Some of these monuments were saved by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. One of them, Maria Krysta, wrote the first post-war booklet devoted to the history of the city.
Restart of the museum in Szczecinek was taken on by Aleksander Stafiński and reverend
Anatol Sałaga, who organized the Civic Committee of the Museum in Szczecinek and Szczecinek Land. In July 1947 the tower of St. Nicholas became a temporary headquarters of the museum
In September 1957, the Presidium of the Municipal National Council in Szczecinek established a new Organizing Committee of the Museum. The organization of the museum was also supported by the Szczecinek branch of the Polish Historical Society. 
On February 28, 1958, during the celebration of the anniversary of the takeover of Szczecinek by the Soviet army, the Regional Museum of Szczecinek was opened. At that moment it was supposed to be located in the church tower of St. Nicholas, but later it was scheduled to be moved to the Castle of Dukes of Pomerania (Zamek Książąt Pomorskich) in Szczecinek. Nevertheless, the exhibition remained at St. Nicholas church until 2006.
Ultimately, thanks to the former mayor of the city, Marian Tomasz Goliński, the museum was moved to the 19th century building of the former local school.
Thanks to the EU grant money, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, and the financing from the city of Szczecinek, the building had been adapted for museum purposes. The ceremonial inauguration took place in 2006. The new headquarters is several times bigger than the previous one and it is more functional. Presently a steady increase of the art collection in the museum is possible thanks to the support of mayor Jerzy Hardie-Douglas.
In the words of the Director of the Regional Museum in Szczecinek, Ireneusz Markanicz:
In 2014 the Regional Museum in Szczecinek celebrated its 100th anniversary.
Temporary exhibitions.
The Regional Museum in Szczecinek reaches out to audiences gathering and presenting valuable collections of important and appreciated artists and other influential figures, among others: artist Wiesław Adamski "In Memoriam.,", and astronomer Adam Giedrys "Mr. Adam. Szczecinek Tailor-Astronomer." Over the years the museum displayed the art work of other artists: "Stanisław Graczyk, Great Poles"., "Szczecinek in Photography of Zbigniew Gabalis"., "Andrzej Foryś".,Maciej Gaca "Unimportant Drawings of a frivolous Guy"., and many more.
Permanent exhibitions.
The Regional Museum in Szczecinek currently holds six permanent exhibitions:

Higher Education Degree Datacheck

Higher Education Degree Datacheck (Hedd) is the UK's official service for verifying academic degrees and authenticating universities. It also takes action against diploma mills purporting to be UK universities. It is funded by the UK government through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and is run by Prospects.
Hedd was created by Prospects in partnership with HEFCE and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in response to fears about fake universities and CV fraud, and went live in 2012 after a beta launch in 2011. At the time, it was believed that there were twice as many fake universities in the UK as real ones. In 2014, it revealed that 8% of degrees submitted could not be verified, with the most common problem being claiming a first class degree when the actual award was at a lower classification. Hedd issued a warning in 2016 against posting graduation selfies with certificates shown, as this would allow fraudulent websites to see and copy the designs of degree certificates. By January 2017 Hedd had shut down more than 40 fake university websites since the UK government announced a crackdown in June 2015, and that it had had reports of over 90 bogus institutions. In December 2017 it officially partnered with the Chinese Service Centre for Scholarly Exchange to validate the degrees of UK graduates returning to or entering China.

American pavilion

The American pavilion is a national pavilion of the Venice Biennale. It houses the United States' official representation during the Biennale.
Background.
The Venice Biennale is an international art biennial exhibition held in Venice, Italy. Often described as "the Olympics of the art world", the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists known for propelling career visibility. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater.
Outside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.
Organization and building.
The American pavilion was the ninth to be built on the Giardini, but unlike other pavilions, which are built by governments, the American pavilion was privately owned. The three-room Palladian building was constructed in 1930, for the New York Grand Central Art Galleries. Ownership transferred to the Museum of Modern Art in 1954 and to the Guggenheim Foundation in 1986.
For the United States' national representation, a committee of experts select from proposals written by institutions. The Advisory Committee on International Exhibitions is assembled by the National Endowment for the Arts and Department of State. The months-long process involves an application nearly 100 pages in length and a final embargo before announcement.
History.
The United States Pavilion at the Venice Biennale was constructed in 1930 by the Grand Central Art Galleries, a nonprofit artists' cooperative established in 1922 by Walter Leighton Clark together with John Singer Sargent, Edmund Greacen, and others. As stated in the Galleries' 1934 catalog, the organization's goal was to "give a broader field to American art; to exhibit in a larger way to a more numerous audience, not in New York alone but throughout the country, thus displaying to the world the inherent value which our art undoubtedly possesses."
In 1930, Walter Leighton Clark and the Grand Central Art Galleries spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The pavilion's architects were William Adams Delano, who also designed the Grand Central Art Galleries, and Chester Holmes Aldrich. The purchase of the land, design, and construction was paid for by the galleries and personally supervised by Clark. As he wrote in the 1934 catalog:
"Pursuing our purpose of putting American art prominently before the world, the directors a few years ago appropriated the sum of $25,000 for the erection of an exhibition building in Venice on the grounds of the International Biennial. Messrs. Delano and Aldrich generously donated the plans for this building which is constructed of Istrian marble and pink brick and more than holds its own with the twenty-five other buildings in the Park owned by the various European governments."
The pavilion, owned and operated by the galleries, opened on May 4, 1930. Approximately 90 paintings and 12 sculptures were selected by Clark for the opening exhibition. Artists featured included Max Boehm, Hector Caser, Lillian Westcott Hale, Edward Hopper, Abraham Poole, Julius Rolshoven, Joseph Pollet, Eugene Savage, Elmer Shofeld, Ofelia Keelan, and African-American artist Henry Tanner. U.S. Ambassador John W. Garrett opened the show together with the Duke of Bergamo.
The Grand Central Art Galleries operated the U.S. Pavilion until 1954, when it was sold to the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). Throughout the 1950s and 1960s shows were organized by MOMA, Art Institute of Chicago, and Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modern withdrew from the Biennale in 1964, and the United States Information Agency ran the Pavilion until it was sold to the Guggenheim Foundation courtesy of funds provided by the Peggy Guggenheim Collection.
Financial support by Philip Morris and private money raised by the Committee for the 1986 American Pavilion at the 1986 Venice Biennale made the exhibition at the United States pavilion possible. Since 1986 the Peggy Guggenheim Collection has worked with the United States Information Agency, the US Department of State and the Fund for Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions in the organization of the visual arts exhibitions at the US Pavilion, while the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation has organized the comparable shows at the Architecture Biennales. Every two years museum curators from across the U.S. detail their visions for the American pavilion in proposals that are reviewed by the NEA Federal Advisory Committee on International Exhibitions (FACIE), a group comprising curators, museum directors and artists who then submit their recommendations to the public-private Fund for United States Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions. Traditionally the endowment's selection committee has chosen a proposal submitted by a museum or curator, but in 2004 it simply chose an artist who in turn has nominated a curator, later approved by the State Department.
Exhibitions.

Saint James' the Elder church (Štvrtok na Ostrove)

Saint James' the Elder church is a Romanesque church in Štvrtok na Ostrove, Slovakia. The church was first mentioned in 1333. The consecration to Saint James the Elder is the oldest to this Apostle in Slovakia.
The prevailing building material used for the original construction in the mid-13th century building boom were bricks. The majority of the romanesque churches in this region of Slovakia is from this period. The two-tower design though makes this church unique on the Žitný ostrov. The only similar one is the church of the Benedictine Abbey of Diakovce. The original face of the church is unknown. It was a single-nave building with a two-tower facade. What the sanctuary once looked like is not known. It is probable that it had the form of an apse with a semi-circular ending, like in the neighboring villages of Mierovo and Alžbetin Dvor, or with a straight end, like in the neighboring village of Hubice. The church is not a classic brick building because the foundations and the lower part of the towers along with other architectural details are made of stone. The existing polygonal presbytery replaced the apse in the 14th century. An earthquake with the epicentre in Komárno struck the church in 1590. The impaired structure caused the northern tower to collapse. It was rebuilt and simultaneously the original single-nave space was arched with two supporting pillars which changed it into a two-naved space. The northern nave was built out and a two-storey building with a square ground plan was added to the southern tower. The medieval character of the church was enhanced during its renovation in the 1960s and 1970s when the neo-gothic southern entrance hall was removed and the first floor of the southern tower received a pair of composite windows.

John Wright Treeby

John Wright Treeby (1809 – 5 September 1882) was a British Conservative Party politician and builder.
Early life.
In early life, Treeby followed his father into the family business. In the late 1820s, he amassed a number of building plots on the St John's Wood estate, where he began building low-density dwellings, known as villas, including Devonshire Villa, the home of the poet Thomas Hood. He was also involved in the construction of archways and sewers for the London Underground's first railway as part of the Metropolitan Board of Works.
Political career.
Upon the recommendation and support of Benjamin Disraeli—the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister—Treeby stood for election as a Conservative for the corrupt borough Lyme Regis, where he had been buying properties for development, at the 1859 general election. During campaigning, Treeby bribed electors—who otherwise "taunted" him from having "risen for the people"—leading to a tie with his rival William Pinney, only settled when the local mayor added an additional vote to the Liberal candidate once polling had closed, blaming a "slow-running watch".
Treeby remained in the constituency, purchasing Highcliffe House in Dorset and becoming the local squire. He stood for election again in 1868, with a platform of ridding the town's sewage problems for free, while also bribing electors with up to £100, and was successfully elected.
In Parliament, he loyally supported the Conservative Party, although he also rebelled on votes relating to parliamentary and local government franchises, siding with the Liberal and philosopher John Stuart Mill, both speaking for and voting for Mill's amendments. He also amended the Conservative Reform Act 1867 bill, requiring overseers of elections to publish lists of ratepayers in arrears and in danger of losing their rote to vote. Yet, he also attempted to make public secret land deals between "resident country gentleman" and railway companies saw him rebuked by fellow Conservatives.
Treeby later ended up at loggerheads with his former ally, Disraeli, when the 1868 Scottish Reform Bill saw an additional seat granted to Scotland at the expense of Lyme Regis, whose parliamentary representation was transferred to Dorset. Treeby was unseated and did not seek re-election elsewhere, ending his parliamentary career.

Murder of Gay Gibson

Eileen Isabella Ronnie Gibson (16 June 1926 – 18 October 1947), known professionally as Gay Gibson, was a British actress who went missing during a sailing of a ship between Cape Town, South Africa, and Southampton, England, in October 1947. The criminal case that followed was known as The Porthole Murder, as James Camb, the man who would be convicted of killing Gibson, admitted that he had pushed her body out of the porthole in her cabin aboard the MV "Durban Castle" into the Atlantic Ocean. Camb claimed that the two had engaged in consensual sex and that she had died of an apparent sudden illness; he had then panicked and thrown her body out of the porthole.
Whilst Camb acknowledged that pushing Gibson's body through the ship's porthole was "a beastly thing to do", he always strenuously denied having killed her, insisting that she had either choked or suffocated whilst the two were in bed together. Camb was convicted of Gibson's murder and sentenced to death by hanging, but a legal move to suspend the death penalty for all crimes in Britain meant he served eleven years in jail for the crime. He denied killing her for the rest of his life.
The Gibson case attracted widespread attention at the time, drawing parallels with film noir and Agatha Christie novels. Even British Prime Minister Winston Churchill commented on the outcome of the case, stating his regret that the punishment of Camb had been commuted to a lesser sentence.
Background.
Eileen Isabella Ronnie 'Gay' Gibson was a 21-year old actress who was travelling back to England on the Union-Castle Line ship, MV "Durban Castle", in October 1947. 'Gay Gibson' was her stage name. She had been on a theatre tour in South Africa with Doreen Mantle, and was returning to London (where she was living) to perform in theatre at the West End. Gibson's presence on board came to the attention of James Camb (born 16 December 1916), a 30-year old steward on the liner. Gibson had been accommodated in cabin 126, B deck, which was in first-class. Camb was seen associating with Gibson, which was against company regulations, and he had been reprimanded over this by a senior officer.
"Durban Castle" had set sail on 10 October and on the 17th, after a night of dancing, Gibson was escorted to her cabin by two friends at 11:30 pm. Sometime around 3:00 am the following morning, the duty watchman, a man called Frederick Steer, was awakened by a summons which had been activated from cabin 126. When he arrived at Gibson's cabin, Steer noted that two lights were lit outside the cabin, one red and one green. One light indicated that the duty steward had been called, whilst the other meant that the duty stewardess had been requested also. Steer thought this strange as usually only one person would be summoned. Steer's knock at the door was answered by Camb, who only half-opened the door and informed him that everything was alright. The duty watchman left as he assumed that as a deck steward, Camb had arrived before him to help the passenger. (Maxtone-Graham and others dispute this saying that the duty watchman believed Camb had made good on his boast to sleep with a passenger).
In the morning, the female steward for Gibson's deck, Eileen Field, came to clean her cabin. She noticed that the bunk was empty, stains on the sheets and the porthole was open. Later, the officer in command of the ship, Captain Patey, interviewed Camb, who initially denied any involvement in Gibson's disappearance. When told that Steer saw him inside Gibson's cabin, Camb relented and told a story that neither the captain or the ship's doctor could believe. Camb stated that during sexual intercourse, Gibson had died and in a fit of abject panic, because he stood to lose his job and family, Camb pushed Gibson through the porthole. At the time, the ship was off the west coast of Africa, heading north. Captain Patey ordered the ship to turn around and to scour the water for Gibson's body. He also contacted the Union-Castle Line offices in London asking for the ship to be met by the police when it arrived in Southampton due to "complications". A return cable was sent to Patey instructing him to "padlock and seal off the room; disturb nothing."
When the ship docked at Cowes Roads in Southampton police officers were waiting to question Camb, who had been confined to his cabin by the ship's crew. Southampton Police were assisted by the Metropolitan Police on the case and forensic evidence was examined at the Met's laboratory at Hendon. This was not uncommon at the time; the Southampton Police was quite small and so often asked for help from Scotland Yard. The police in the United Kingdom were involved as even though the murder took place off the coast of West Africa (Portuguese Guinea at the time, now Guinea-Bissau) it was a British ship under British authority, so the prosecution was brought by the British authorities.
On Monday 27 October 1947, the "Southern Daily Echo" reported that Camb, a deck steward from "Durban Castle", had been remanded in custody and charged with "murder on the high seas".
Trial and aftermath.
Camb's trial in Winchester was an unusual one, since it was labelled by some as the first case in English law whereby a prosecution was sought without a victim's body. This has been pointed out to be untrue, as there was a case thirteen years earlier where a father (Thomas Davidson) was convicted of murdering his son (John) and even further back to the Campden Wonder case in 1660. The case also gained some interest due to it mirroring a plot of a crime novel. Richard Latto described the story as having all the hallmarks of an Agatha Christie piece: "a young actress, a dashing steward, romance and a suspicious death on the high seas."
During the trial, it was revealed that pathologist Denis Hockling had discovered a urine stain on the sheets from cabin 126. It was stated by the Crown Pathologist that involuntary urination is something that occurs during strangulation. Hockling argued that it could have been a result of natural causes. The contents, walls and porthole section from cabin 126 were removed by the police and used as exhibits in the court case.
When Camb took the stand, the prosecution barrister asked him if he considered himself an honest man. Camb replied, "I think so, sir." It was then proven in court that Camb had changed his story six times in what he defended as self-preservation. When asked about pushing Gibson's body through the porthole, Camb acknowledged that it was "beastly conduct."
After a four day hearing, the jury deliberated for 45 minutes and returned with a guilty verdict. Camb was sentenced to death by Justice Hilbery on 22 March 1948. However, the execution was not carried out because Parliament was considering the abolition of the death penalty at the time and the Home Secretary had elected to commute all pending death sentences while the matter was discussed. This prompted British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to comment that, "The House of Commons has, by its vote, saved the life of the brutal lascivious murderer who thrust the poor girl he had raped and assaulted through a porthole of the ship to the sharks." An appeal was lodged and heard in April 1948, but was denied. Camb was released from prison in 1959, but he was recalled to prison after being convicted of a number of indecent assaults of young girls. He was released again in 1978. He died in July 1979 from heart failure. Eileen Gibson's body was never found.
In popular culture.
Several books have been written about Gibson's death, and while most have been factual, some have taken the story as a basis for a novel. "The Finest Type of English Womanhood" by Rachael Heath uses the Porthole Murder as a backstory to her novel detailing the lives of Gibson and her fictional friend, Laura Trelling. The title of the book is taken from a line spoken by Gibson's mother in court when asked to describe her daughter.
In 1991, the Radio 4 series "Murder Most Foul" profiled the killing with dramatisations.
A 2011 biography of Sid James, the "Carry On" film star, forwarded the theory that Gibson was returning to England to find James, as she was his jilted lover. Cliff Goodwin's biography is the only piece written about the comic star that mentions this theory. Other authors have debunked it.
Some people continue to have doubts about Camb's guilt. In 2018, the BBC broadcast a short documentary programme about the killing and asked whether or not Camb was guilty. The 30-minute programme was first aired on the BBC News Channel in March 2018. In the programme, Doreen Mantle details how she had seen Gibson faint and go blue around the lips. This was also attested to at the trial by the theatre manager Hilary Gilbert. The proposal of Gibson being ill was put to Gibson's mother during Camb's trial, but she flatly denied that her daughter was in ill-health. During the Second World War, Gibson enlisted herself in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and during July 1946, a junior ATS officer reported being called out to a Private Gibson who was on her bed with her back arched, unable to breathe with her tongue at the back of her throat. Gibson would later state to the ATS officer that she had had one of her "turns".

Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol

The men's ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 1 and 2 August 2021 at the Asaka Shooting Range. Approximately 30 shooters from 20 nations are expected to compete in the rapid fire pistol, with the precise number depending on how many shooters compete in multiple events.
Background.
This will be the 26th of what has been standardised in 1948 as the men's ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event, the only event on the 2020 programme that traces back to 1896. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1928 (when no shooting events were held) and 1908; it was nominally open to women from 1968 to 1980, although very few women participated these years. The first five events were quite different, with some level of consistency finally beginning with the 1932 event—which, though it had differences from the 1924 competition, was roughly similar. The 1936 competition followed the 1932 one quite closely. The post-World War II event substantially altered the competition once again. The 1984 Games introduced women's-only shooting events, including the ISSF 25 meter pistol (though this is more similar to the non-Olympic men's ISSF 25 meter center-fire pistol than the rapid fire pistol).
Of the six finalists from 2016, one has been announced as a returning competitor. Jean Quiquampoix of France earned a qualifying spot at the 2018 World Championships and has been selected by his NOC. Three other 2016 finalists (gold medalist Christian Reitz of Germany, fifth-place finisher Leuris Pupo of Cuba, and sixth-place finisher Riccardo Mazzetti of Italy) have earned quota spots but their NOCs have not announced selections yet. The remaining two (bronze medalist Li Yuehong and fourth-place finisher Zhang Fusheng of China) saw other shooters from their NOC earn spots; the NOC has not announced its selections yet.
The United States has earned a qualifying spot and is expected to make its 22nd appearance, most of any nation.
Qualification.
Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to two shooters if the NOC earns enough quota sports or has enough double starter-qualified shooters. To compete, a shooter needs a quota spot and to achieve a Minimum Qualification Score (MQS). Once a shooter is using a quota spot in any shooting event, they can enter any other shooting event for which they have achieved the MQS as well (a double starter qualification). There are 29 quota spots available for the rapid fire pistol (significantly increased since the elimination of the 50 metre pistol after 2016). They are: 4 for the 2018 World Championships, 8 for 2019 World Cup events, 13 from continental events (4 each from Asia and Europe, 3 from the Americas, and 1 each from Africa and Oceania), 1 for the host nation (Japan), 2 from Tripartite Commission invitations, and 1 from world ranking. 
The MQS for the men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol for 2020 is 560.
The COVID-19 pandemic delayed some of the events for qualifying for shooting, though many had been complete before the effects were felt.
Competition format.
The competition format will continue to use the two-round (qualifying round and final) format, as in 1988 and since 1996, with the final format introduced in 2012. The 2005 rules changes required the pistols used to be sport pistols, banning .22 Short cartridges.
The qualifying round from 1988 onward was essentially the same as the full competition format from 1948 to 1984. Each shooter fired 60 shots. These were done in two courses of 30; each course consisted of two stages of 15; each stage consisted of three series of 5. In each stage, the time limit for each series was 8 seconds for the first, 6 seconds for the second, and 4 seconds for the third. 
The 1988 tournament had added a two-series final for the top eight shooters; the 1992 competition broke that down to a four-series semifinal for the top eight and two-series final for the top four. In 1996 and 2000, the top eight once again advanced to the final. The 2004 version had reduced the number of finalists to six, where it stayed in 2008 and 2012.
Prior to 2008, the final involved two series of 5 shots at 4 seconds. In 2008, that was expanded to four series. The 2012 competition used an entirely different format, however, which remained in effect in 2016 and 2020. The competition switched to a "hit-or-miss" system, where a 9.7 or better scores as a "hit" for 1 point and anything lower scores as a "miss" for 0 points. The final featured 8 series of 5 shots each (5 points maximum per series, 40 points maximum total). However, starting with the fourth series, the remaining shooter with the lowest total was eliminated after each series (5 shooters remaining in the fifth series, 4 in the sixth, 3 in the seventh, and only 2 in the eighth and final series).
The 1992 competition had introduced round targets rather than the silhouettes used from 1948 to 1988 as well as many pre-World War II versions of the event. Score, rather than hits, had been used as the primary ranking method since 1960.

Viktor, a Steampunk Adventure

Viktor, a Steampunk Adventure is a point n' click adventure game developed by Zagreb-based Studio Spektar. It boasts a cartoony steampunk setting placed in an imagined version of Agram, Austria-Hungary where characters are replaced by animals. The adventure follows Viktor, a boar disillusioned with his role as a janitor, and sets on a journey to become the next Emperor of Austria-Hungary. It was first released on Steam in March, 2017.
Gameplay.
The game's core follows the classic point n' click adventure formula, but with some innovations on its own. For instance, the game is notable for its use of gibberish in recorded dialogue, which is supplemented with subtitles in English. It also uses records as collectibles, which could be used to change the game's musical backdrop. The entire game is littered with minigames often utilizing arcade instances and reflexes.
Development.
The game went through an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign, but was developed despite this due to the investment and passion of the developers in the project. One of the developers explained the process for choosing the setting as "When we decided to fragment the game in multiple episodes, it was logical that Viktor starts in Zagreb, or Agram in Austria-Hungary, which is in Sven’s world an industrial zone in the style of early twentieth century, only with more robots and mobile phones, rather than cockroaches".

Shooting at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's trap

The men's ISSF Olympic trap event at the 2020 Summer Olympics took place on 28 and 29 July 2021 at the Asaka Shooting Range. Approximately 30 sport shooters from 20 nations are expected to compete in the trap, with the precise number depending on how many shooters compete in multiple events.
Background.
This will be the 23rd appearance of the men's Olympic trap event. The event was held at every Summer Olympics from 1896 to 1924 (except 1904, when no shooting events were held) and from 1952 to 2016; it was open to women from 1968 to 1992.
Of the six semifinalists from 2016, none have yet been announced as a returning competitor. 2016 gold medalist Josip Glasnović of Croatia and bronze medalist David Kostelecký of the Czech Republic have earned qualifying places for their nations, but the nations have not announced who they have selected to compete. Silver medalist (and 2000–2008 medalist) Giovanni Pellielo and sixth-place finisher (and 2012 silver medalist Massimo Fabbrizi are from Italy, which has earned a qualifying place but has not announced its selectee. 
World champions since the 2016 Games have been Daniele Resca of Italy (2017), Alberto Fernández of Spain (2018), and Matthew Coward-Holley of Great Britain (2019). Coward-Holley has been named as one of Great Britain's two competitors. Italy and Spain have not announced their competitors. 
No nations among those qualified are making their debut in the event. Great Britain has earned qualifying spots and is expected to make its 21st appearance, most of any nation.
Qualification.
Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to two shooters if the NOC earns enough quota sports or has enough double starter-qualified shooters. To compete, a shooter needs a quota spot and to achieve a Minimum Qualification Score (MQS). Once a shooter is using a quota spot in any shooting event, they can enter any other shooting event for which they have achieved the MQS as well (a double starter qualification). There are 29 quota spots available for the trap. They are: 4 for the 2018 World Championships, 8 for 2019 World Cup events, 13 from continental events (4 from Europe, 4 from the Americas, 3 from Asia, and 1 each from Africa and Oceania), 1 for the host nation (Japan), 2 from Tripartite Commission invitations, and 1 from world ranking. 
The MQS for the men's trap for 2020 is 112.
The COVID-19 pandemic delayed some of the events for qualifying for shooting, though many had been complete before the effects were felt.
Competition format.
The competition will not continue to use the format introduced in 2016, with a qualifying round, semifinal, and finals. Instead, only qualification and final round remain.
In the qualifier, each shooter fires 5 sets of 25 targets in trap shooting, with 10 targets being thrown to the left, 10 to the right, and 5 straight-away in each set. The shooters can take two shots at each target. Six shooters advance to the final round.
The final round consists of 25 targets, after which a shooter with lowest number of successful shots is eliminated (placing 6th in the overall competition standings). Then one shooter is eliminated after each round of 5 shots until only 2 shooters remain. The last two shooters then take 10 shots, making it 50 shots in total. Only one shot can be taken at each target in the final round.
Ties are broken using a shoot-off; additional shots are fired one at a time until there is no longer a tie.

Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.
Schedule.
The competition is held over two days, Wednesday, 28 July and Thursday, 29 July. The first part of the qualifying round is the first day (75 shots); the second part of the qualifying round (50 shots) as well as the final round is on the second day.

Seth Bemis

Seth Bemis (January 23, 1775 - April 4, 1851) was an American entrepreneur, active along the Charles River in the early Industrial Revolution. It is claimed that he was the first to manufacture cotton duck cloth. He was also father to attorney George Bemis.
Bemis was one of the three sons of David Bemis, builder of the Bemis Dam in 1778, which powered the first paper mill on the Charles River. When the elder Bemis died in 1790, his estate - including snuff and gristmills in Watertown, as well as a paper mill on the Newton side of the river - was divided among his three sons. Seth Bemis was then studying for admission to Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1795. After graduation, he briefly worked as a lawyer, then entered the employment of his sole surviving brother Luke, and shortly after becoming 21 purchased a half-interest in the Watertown mills as his brother's partner. On July 15, 1798, he bought out his brother, the partnership was dissolved, and Bemis became sole proprietor of the Watertown mills. For the next few years he experimented with the production of chocolate (which manufacture eventually went to the Walter Baker &amp; Company of Dorchester), and the grinding of grain, dye goods, and medicinal roots.
In 1803 he built a cotton factory as an addition to his mill, and placed within it machinery for carding and spinning cotton and for making cotton warps. To clean the cotton, he invented his own machinery, which he called "the devil"; it was very similar to Eli Whitney's cotton gin, which had not been properly patented. His textile fabrics, particularly his popular "Bemis warp", were consigned for some years to Isaac Bowers' dry goods store in Boston. On February 28, 1806, Bemis petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for tax relief as follows: "The subscriber has at a very considerable expense lately erected a cotton mill in Watertown and wishes for some encouragement in his undertaking that may in part counterbalance the many inconveniences and losses which so frequently accompany enterprises which are but experiments. The subscriber flatters himself as the business has become very extensive in a neighboring State and as large quantities of cotton yarn are now being sent to our markets for sale that the General Court will In their wisdom see fit to place him on an equal standing with other manufacturers of this article in this State and exempt his cotton mill from taxes for seven years". His petition was granted in 1807 for a period of five years, and that same year Bemis put into operation a number of hand looms and began to manufacture sheeting, shirting, satinet, and bed ticking.
In 1809 he decided manufacture of a new type of fabric from cotton yarns, namely "cotton duck" or sail cloth. Before this time, sail cloth had been made only from linen or flax yarn. The first sails were made from Bemis' cotton duck in Boston in November 1809, and his duck was used extensively during the War of 1812. It furnished the sails for the USS Constitution (old Ironsides) when it was being repaired. For a time, the cotton duck business was so profitable that Bemis not only enlarged his mills at Watertown but contracted for the labor of convicts in the Charlestown State Prison, where he set up a large number of looms. The manufacture of duck was discontinued in 1816.
Sometime before 1810, Bemis introduced machinery for grinding and cutting glass and for polishing lights for lighthouses, as well as for insertion in the decks of vessels and binnacle lights, under a patent granted in 1809 to Captain Winslow Lewis (who was also his selling agent for cotton duck).
In the fall of 1812, Bemis and an "English expert" built a gas house at the east end of the old Watertown mill, and began extracting gas from coal and using it to illuminate his factory. However, because the gas went through tin pipes, which it corroded, the "unsavory material" (gas) leaked and was odorous, non-economical, and dangerous. Its use was discontinued after two years.
In 1821 Bemis purchased from his brother Luke and Caleb Eddy the Bemis Mill on the Newton side of the Charles River, and thus became sole owner of the whole water power. Soon after, he built the rolling stone-dam, unique in the United States (the only other known example is near Warwick Castle in England). Precisely how it worked is not clear, but it seems that the height of the dam was controlled by a mechanically-operated drum that could be rolled up and down the inclined face of the stone dam. Soon after the dam was installed, his upstream neighbor, the Boston Manufacturing Company in Waltham, complained that the river was backing up to its waterwheels and impeding their operation. The company subsequently paid Bemis $12,000 to reduce the height of the dam by a foot.
Bemis continued to operate the mills on both sides of the river until 1848, sometimes alone, sometimes with others, notably his brother Luke. His son, Seth Jr., was largely responsible for the success of the dye works, and took over the management of all the mills on both sides of the river when Bemis died.

Barabba, South Australia

Barabba is a locality in the Mid North region of South Australia, between Mallala and Hamley Bridge on the north bank of the Light River.
Barabba includes the former government town of Aliceburgh which was proclaimed in 1879 and named for Governor William Jervois' daughter Alice.
The name Barabba is derived from an Aboriginal word for an indigenous bulrush plant. The town of Aliceburgh ceased to exist in 1897 and was resurveyed into larger workingmen's blocks. A Primitive Methodist Church opened in 1877. The Barabba post office operated from 1877 until 1971. It operated from the school building until 1926. The school itself closed in 1960 and the building was destroyed by the 2015 Pinery bushfire. The final service in the church was held in 1967 and it has since been demolished.

As a senior, he was 9-0 in nine starts, striking out 108 in 58 innings while allowing only three runs and ten hits, earning him the title of Tennessee's DII-A Mr. Baseball. He was selected by the San Diego Padres in the 37th round of the 2016 MLB draft, but did not sign and instead enrolled at the University of Mississippi where he played college baseball.
As a freshman in 2017, Rolison began the season in the bullpen before moving into the starting rotation. In 19 games (ten starts), he compiled a 6-3 record and a 3.06 ERA, holding opposing batters to a .242 average, earning him a spot on the SEC All-Freshman team along with freshman All-American honors. After his freshman season, he played for the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League where he went 4-0 with a 1.92 ERA and was named a league all-star. Rolison was named a First Team Preseason All-American prior to his sophomore season. As a sophomore in 2018, Rolison posted a 10-4 record over 17 appearances (16 starts) with a 3.70 ERA and 120 strikeouts.
Professional career.
Rolison was selected by the he Colorado Rockies in the first round, with the 22nd overall selection, in the 2018 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the Rockies for a $2.9 million signing bonus. He made his professional debut with the Grand Junction Rockies of the Rookie-level Pioneer League and spent the whole season there. In nine starts, he compiled a 0-1 record with a 1.86 ERA and a 0.79 WHIP.
Rolison began 2019 with the Asheville Tourists of the Class A South Atlantic League. Rolison was promoted to the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League after going 2-1 with a 0.69 ERA and 14 strikeouts in 14 innings with the Tourists. With Lancaster, he was selected to participate in the All-Star Game as a member of the South Division team. Over 22 starts with the JetHawks, Rolison went 6-7 with a 4.87 ERA, striking out 118 over innings. He did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To begin the 2021 season, Rolison was assigned to the Hartford Yard Goats of the Double-A Northeast. After going 2-1 with a 3.07 ERA over three starts, he was promoted to the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Triple-A West. On June 14, he was placed on the injured list after having his appendix removed. He was expected to return in early August, but broke a bone in his left hand while fielding balls, delaying his return. He was activated later that same month.
Personal life.
The same night that Rolison was selected by the Rockies in the draft, controversy emerged after a tweet by him from 2012 resurfaced in which he wrote “Well we have one hope left … if someone shoots him during his speech,” regarding the 2012 United States presidential election. He later apologized, saying “I had no idea what I was talking about, and it was immature of me to post something like that.”

Luana Pavan

Luana Pavan (born 3 March 1963) is an Italian former footballer who played as a goalkeeper for the Italy women's national football team. At club level she collected four women's Serie A winner's medals and three Coppa Italia winner's medals.
Club career.
Pavan began her football career at Belluno, where she played alongside fellow promising youngster Carolina Morace. A tall goalkeeper with what the "Dizionario del Calcio Italiano" described as a "fisico da indossatrice" (), Pavan was an iconic member of the Trani team of the 1980s "golden era" of Italian women's football. She won three league titles and married the goalkeeper of Trani's men's team, but stopped playing during 1985–86 due to pregnancy.
In 1987–88 she returned to play for minnows Somma Vesuviana, but a mooted return to Trani failed to materialise when the Apulian giants folded at the end of the season. Instead Pavan linked up with Giugliano Campania, where she won a League and Cup double in 1988–89 and a Cup in 1990 before the club went bust upon the withdrawal of sponsors Gran Bazar. Pavan quit top level football and moved with her family to Abruzzo, where she played for local non-league teams in Vasto. She made a brief return to Serie A with Lugo in 1998–99.
International career.
With the Italy women's national football team, Pavan was a longstanding understudy to Eva Russo. She made her debut in August 1982 in a 2–1 home upset by Scotland and won the last of her six official caps as a substitute in a 1–1 friendly draw with England staged at Loakes Park, High Wycombe on 11 November 1989.
Personal life.
Pavan was married to Felice and had children Valentina and Alessandra. The demands of motherhood and her other career as a chemicals expert reduced her ability to keep playing football at the top level.

Nos Pilifs Farm

Nos Pilifs Farm is a farm and company that hires disabled people (nonprofit organization) founded in 1984 and located in Brussels.
History.
In 1971 Nelly Seiler Filipson (1926–2012), sensitized by her personal background, created a rehabilitation centre in Laeken for children with mental disabilities. She named it Nos Pilifs from an anagram of her name. This centre still receives some fifty disabled children up to the age of 13. Other organizations have been created to meet the needs of disabled persons who attended the centre. That is how the leisure club was established in 1980, "La Ferme Nos Pilifs" as a company that hires people with disabilities in 1984, the Maison Nos Pilifs providing accommodation and support service in 1985, "le Potelier des Pilifs" day centre in 1989, the "Ados Pilifs" secondary school for autistic children in 2011, the "Villa Pilifs" hostel in 2015, and soon "Les Piloux" inclusive children's nursery. All these private nonprofit organizations share the same philosophy: acceptance of difference and inclusion of people with disabilities. 
The centre.
Nos Pilifs centre is a pre-primary and primary school with specialized education for children with pervasive developmental disorders (specialized in type 3 – autism) or with mental retardation or deficiency. The school is part of the non-confessional network. Nos Pilifs centre provides multidisciplinary care in speech therapy, psychomotor education, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and behavioural psychology.
Ferme Nos Pilifs ASBL.
The farm was created in 1984, on the initiative of Mrs Filipson and Benoit Ceysens in response to a lack of employment for disabled people in the north of Brussels. The farm is now a recognized company with disabled employees certified by the Cocof. For social and ecological purposes, 140 out of its 180 employees are disabled. It works a 12-acre long field in Neder-Over-Heembeek in the north of Brussels, with an animal park, a garden centre, different plots, a grocery shop, a brewery and a conditioning workshop for organic dry food. Eight teams of gardeners also offer various gardening services. Children can spend their school breaks at the farm, and school groups can visit it on field trips at any time of the year. Through those various activities, Nos Pilifs Farm showcases disabled people's skills and gives them a real role in their neighbourhood.

The Evansville &amp; Eastern Electric Railway was put into operation on 10 June 1906 was one of the very few electric lines in the United States which did 
not parallel a steam railroad.
Route.
The railroad extended a distance of from Newburgh, Indiana, which had a population of about 1500 people, to Rockport, having about 3500 inhabitants, with a spur north to Richland, Indiana. However, traffic arrangements had been made with the Evansville Suburban &amp; Newburgh Railroad, whereby railcars were operated into Evansville over the tracks of the latter company. 
The railroad passed through a rich farming country. Corn was raised on the river bottom farms on one side, while the land to the north was devoted to wheat raising. Wheat, which took one of the first prizes at the Chicago World's Fair, was cultivated on land near the line in Warrick County. 
Previously, farmers of the region traversed have been compelled to haul their grain distances up to to Rockport, Boonville and Newburgh. Those near the river made shipments by way of unreliable river boats. Practically all these shipments from the territory from the line were subsequently carried over it. Before the railroad was completed the farmers made such insistent demands that arrangements were made to haul car-load lots of grain by means of the construction locomotive and about two hundred car loads were hauled. 
The railroad was practically a farmers' line, and the greater portion of the receipts were derived from the farmers. There was, however, considerable through passenger traffic between Evansville and Rockport. The steam-railroad route between the two cities was long as against by the electric line. The time over the steam road was not to be considered, since very unreliable connections were made at Rockport Junction. During the first month's operation of the railroad an investigation showed that only five through steam-road tickets had been sold 
between Rockport and Evansville, and in three instances business along the line compelled the purchasers to take this route. 
Owensboro, Kentucky, a city of about 15,000 people, located on the Ohio River, below Rockport, was also served by the line through boats which made connections with trains at Rockport. Other than the terminals the only towns on the main line were Yankeetown and Hatfield, with about 400 people each. Eureka, Indiana, with probably 600 people, lied about south of the line, and Richland, on the spur already referred to, had a population of about 800 inhabitants.
Track and roadway.
All of the route, but particularly the western portion, was very picturesque. For about after leaving Newburgh the track was laid over bluffs on the bank of the Ohio River. The railroad then crossed behind the hills and passed over Cypress Creek on truss steel construction long. The only other steel structure on the line was that over Pigeon Creek, which was in length. Both rested on concrete abutments. Near Yankeetown the tracks were carried over a ravine on a wood trestle which was planned to be displaced later by a fill. 
The heaviest grading was necessary near Yankeetown where some 22-ft. cuts were made. East of Yankeetown the country is comparatively level. All cuts were made 22 ft. wide at the bottom and fills are 14 ft. at the top. 
The track is laid with 70-lb/yard (35 kg/m) rails on oak ties, obtained largely from the neighboring country. The entire railroad was bonded with brazed bonds, the work being done by the Electric Railway Improvement Company, of Cleveland, Ohio. 
Sidings varied in length from to and were located at about 3-mile intervals. All passing sidings were double end; others are stub end. The sidings were placed more frequently than otherwise to provide for the simultaneous operation of freight trains and passenger cars. 
Throughout its length the road was ballasted with gravel taken from the bed of the Ohio River, just above Newburgh. The gravel was dug up and loaded into barges by a dredge boat, and a tug towed the barges down the river to a coalmine incline, which extended over the tracks of the electric line. The coal-mine engines were used to pull small cars of gravel up the incline, and these cars were dumped, either directly into the ballast cars or into a hopper underneath the incline. The gravel was almost entirely free from sand and makes an excellent roadbed. 
As the road was built partly for freight traffic, heavy grades were eliminated wherever possible. There was, however, one short grade of 2.4 per cent near Yankeetown.
Overhead lines.
The trolley poles, which were of chestnut, and long, were spaced apart on tangents and as close as on curves. The poles were always placed on the outside of curves and are braced, either by deadmen, as shown in one of the accompanying illustrations, or by guy anchors. As no high-tension wires were carried on the poles, unnecessary height of poles was avoided by using a tubular steel bracket braced on the under side. A single trolley of No. 000 round wire was used. Telephone wires and feeders were carried on a cross-arm just below the bracket. Shaw nonarcing lightning arresters grounded to steel rods were placed three to the mile. All of the overhead material with the 
exception of the lightning arresters was furnished by the Ohio Brass Company.
Power station and feeder system.
The power station was located about midway of the length of the line, at Hartfield. It was a brick structure, divided into a boiler and engine room by a transverse wall. The boiler room contained two 300 hp B. &amp; W. boilers served by one steel stack. In the engine room are installed two 375 kW units each, consisting of a Westinghouse compound non-condensing engine and a Westinghouse 600-volt generator. The switchboard was of Western Electric Company manufacture and consisted of two generator and two feeder panels. Water for the boilers was obtained from wells sunk near the power house, and coal was hauled in the company's cars from mines at Newburgh. 
A 500,000 circ. mil feeder left the power house in each direction. The feeders continued at this size to points from the station where they are reduced in size to 350,000 circ. mil. These smaller feeders were carried to within of the ends of the line.
Repair shops.
A brick repair shop adjacent to the power house at Hatfield contained three storage tracks and space along one wall for the installation of requisite machinery.
Rolling stock.
The road was equipped with five passenger cars built by the American Car Company. The cars were long over all, wide and seated forty-eight people. The inside finish was dark oak. All were built with a small baggage compartment at one end and were intended for double-end operation. They were equipped with four Westinghouse 101-J motors of 50 hp each, and these were mounted on 21 E-1 Brill trucks. K-14 controllers were used. The cars were provided with Westinghouse Traction Brake Company straight air brakes, and Peter Smith hot-water heaters. They were painted a Big Four yellow, which color has been adopted by the company as a standard and is being used wherever possible. 
Package freight was hauled in an express car of practically the same dimensions as the passenger cars. For handling heavy freight a steam locomotive and twelve standard steam-railroad freight cars were employed. 
Passenger cars were operated between Evansville and Rockport on an hourly schedule. The run required 1 hour and 20 minutes and three cars were employed. The express car made two round trips per day. 
At Rockport an agent was employed who gave all of his time to the company. In the other towns the agent was employed on a commission basis. Tickets were sold at approximately 2 cents per mile. An extra charge of 25 cents per piece was made for baggage. 
The operating offices, which were now located in Evansville, were planned to be ultimately moved to Hatfield. 
The road was constructed and partially financed by the Tennis Company, of Cincinnati, with C. H. Battin as engineer in charge. 
The officers of the Evansville &amp; Eastern Traction Company were initially: 
The company and the Evansville &amp; Mt. Vernon Electric Railway were held and operated by the Evansville Railways Company.
Traffic.
Including the two terminal towns the population along the line was not more than 400 per mile (640 per km), taken 2½ miles (4 km) back on each side of the track. In the Northern portion of Indiana very few lines have been built through territories not showing a population of twice or three times as great. However, in estimating the possible earnings of the Evansville &amp; Eastern Traction Company it must be remembered that the territory was entirely dependent on the line both for passenger and freight service, and that this exclusive territory extended back from the line in some places as great a distance as . Moreover, it must be remembered that Evansville, though not on the line proper, must, under the initial operating conditions, be regarded as a terminal. 
During the first few months operation the receipts have been such as to justify the belief that in electric railway construction there has been too great a tendency to parallel already existing steam lines, rather than to push out through thickly settled farming country, remote from steam roads.
The operation of the railroad was discontinued in 1938.

It is the band's first full album of original material to feature original drummer Nick D'Virgilio since "X" in 2010. D'Virgilio had previously recorded a new song with the band for the compilation album "The First Twenty Years" and a bonus track for the band's previous album "The Oblivion Particle", both released in 2015. "Noise Floor" was released on 25 May 2018.
Background and recording.
In October 2016, drummer Jimmy Keegan announced that he had left Spock's Beard in order to pursue other interests and the band's original drummer, Nick D'Virgilio, was drafted in to fulfill concert commitments. In March 2017, the band confirmed that they had begun writing for their next album, with plans to begin recording in May with D'Virgilio as studio drummer.
As with their previous three albums, recording and mixing for the then untitled thirteenth album was conducted at The Mouse House in Altadena, California, with additional drum tracking at Sweetwater in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Mixing was completed by Rich Mouser in February 2018.
In March 2018, the album title and release date were revealed. It was also announced that the album would be released with a bonus EP of material from the same recording sessions, titled "Cutting Room Floor". It was released on 25 May 2018.
Reception.
The album received generally favourable reviews. In his review for Sonic Perspectives, Scott Medina praised Rich Mouser's production and the band members' musicianship, stating that "none of the material here may reach the Top 10 Spock's songs of all time, but they all hover within a good to excellent range". Reviews for "Keyboard" magazine and The Prog Report both singled out Ryo Okumoto's contribution as particularly noteworthy.

Nikolaos Bourantas

Nikolaos Bourantas (; 1900 – 16 January 1981) was a Nazi collaborator during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II in the capacity of City Police officer. Following the end of the war he was acquitted of war crimes charges and promoted to head of the City Police. Bourantas went to become an MP for the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture and chief of the Hellenic Fire Service.
Biography.
Nikolaos Bourantas was born in 1900. During the course of the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II, he commanded the 700-man motorized unit of the City Police, which came to be known as "Bourantades" (Μπουραντάδες, "Bourantas' men"). The unit actively participated in security operations against urban resistance groups in Athens, most notably in the suburbs of Kokkinia, Kallithea, Vyronas, and Kaisariani. Bourantas and his men engaged in arrests, torture and executions of alleged resistance members, transferring a number of suspects to the German authorities who in turn sent them to concentration camps. Following the end of the war Bourantas was tried by the Special Collaborationist Court of Athens, with proceedings beginning on 20 November 1945. The chief of City Police Angelos Evert, among other high-ranking police officials, testified in Bourantas' defense. The trial ended with an acquittal of the accused, with the judge D. Golfinopoulos claiming that evidence provided by the persecution was inconclusive. Golfinopoulos judged that the violent suppression of anti-Axis demonstrations was conducted by the "Bourantades" in order to prevent Axis units from taking matters in their own hands, thus avoiding greater bloodshed, while on the occasion Bourantas followed orders while acting under duress. The case of the collaboration between Axis units and the City Police in the Kallithea security operation was ruled out as an unfortunate coincidence. Furthermore, Bourantas was pronounced innocent in the charge of collaborating with the Security Battalions and ignorant of the fact that his subordinates had handed suspects to the Germans. Finally Golfinopoulos inquired whether the defendant would seek monetary compensation from his accusers for moral injury, which Bourantas declined.
Bourantas' release led to a public outcry over the judicial decision, which prompted the Minister of Public Order Konstantinos Rentis to call for the suspension of Bourantas from the police force and for his case to be reexamined. Nevertheless, Rentis' suggestions were not implemented. Afterwards Bourantas was promoted to head of City Police. Bourantas was elected into the Hellenic Parliament as a representative of the Metaxist Politically Independent Alignment for the Attica and Boeotia Prefecture constituency in the 1950 Greek legislative election. Between 1959 and 1964, Bourantas served as the head of the Hellenic Fire Service. Bourantas died on 16 January 1981, at the Evangelismos Hospital in Athens. He was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens.

Limoilou dust controversy

The Limoilou dust controversy involves the Port of Quebec, St. Lawrence Stevedoring Ltd. and the residents of Quebec City, who claimed that the quality of their environment and their health had been degraded by dust emanating from ore transshipment at the nearby port. The controversy was triggered in October 2012 by the observation of red dust covering sections of the Vieux-Limoilou neighborhood. After documenting other similar incidents, residents filed two class-action suits against the Port of Quebec and St. Lawrence Stevedoring. In March 2018, St. Lawrence Stevedoring recognized its responsibility for the incidents, and agreed to compensate residents who could prove damages.
Chronology.
The controversy was triggered by a "storm of red dust" in October 2012, which left deposits of an uncertain nature on sidewalks, balconies and cars in the Limoilou and Saint-Sacrament neighborhoods. Urgence-Environnement, an intervention team from the provincial government's environmental ministry (then known by its French acronym MDDEFP), was immediately summoned to the area by residents. Several days later, St. Lawrence Stevedoring, which rented space at the Port of Quebec for transshipment of goods, confirmed that the red dust was composed of iron oxide from an iron ore transfer in the Beauport Bay area. The company also claimed that the dust storm was an isolated incident.
On October 26, 2012, Limoilou residents collected dust samples to be analyzed in a private laboratory. Results showed that the dust contained high levels of iron, as well as other heavy metals including copper, nickel and zinc. With these findings in hand, residents directly confronted the mayor of Quebec City during a city council meeting. Additionally, the environmental ministry's findings led to the filing of a notice of non-conformity with St. Lawrence Stevedoring.
In the following days, other residents contacted media outlets to share their observations about dust clouds around the Port of Quebec, saying that such incidents had taken place in the area on other occasions. Residents of the Cap-Blanc neighborhood had also been affected by the dust, adding that their frequency had been increasing over the previous few years. Furthermore, during summer 2012, residents of Levis, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River across from Quebec City, also observed clouds of red dust coming from the port on several occasions; deposits of dust had been noticed there as well. In the wake of the reports, media sources also revealed that the MDDEFP had been surveying the Port of Quebec's activities since 2003 due to its dust emissions.
In November 2012, residents collected new dust samples in the Limoilou and Saint-Jean-Baptiste neighborhoods for analysis. Once again, the results showed elevated concentrations of heavy metals occasionally exceeding provincial and federal environmental standards; residents claimed that it was proof that metallic dust from the Port of Quebec was regularly emitted into the air of the surrounding neighborhoods.
Shortly afterwards, St. Lawrence Stevedoring claimed that while the dust may have inconvenienced residents, it did not represent a health risk. These conclusions stemmed from analysis of the samples obtained by the MDDEFP, the results of which contrasted with those obtained by the residents.
In December 2012, a web site compiling residents' observations regarding the Port of Quebec was created.
In January 2013, in its annual report, the Port of Quebec recognized that the dust episode on October 26 was unfortunate and to be avoided in the future, while also emphasizing its isolated nature. In response, the MDDEFP issued a press release soliciting the port's assistance with its investigation. However, the Quebec Port Authority was hesitant to cooperate and did little to assist, instead challenging the applicability of provincial law in court.
A class-action suit is filed.
On January 14, 2013, a request for authorization to submit a class-action suit was submitted by a Limoilou resident, looking to compensate residents affected by the October 26, 2012 dust episode and to require the Port of Quebec to modify its facility to prevent all dust emissions beyond its property.
In March 2013, another suit was submitted by Limoilou residents towards the Port of Quebec after another dust episode.
The environmental ministry corroborates residents' findings.
In April 2013, the provincial environmental ministry (MDDEP) released test results of the concentration of various metals in the air in Limoilou, taken between 2000 and 2012. The results showed that in the majority of those years, the average nickel concentration exceeded environmental standards. From 2010 to 2012, the average concentration was 5.7 times above normal limits. The ministry concluded that the Port of Quebec was the source of the nickel, and issued a notice of non-compliance to St. Lawrence Stevedoring, which carried out nickel transshipment on Port property. St. Lawrence Stevedoring, while still calling into question its responsibility for air pollution in Limoilou, nevertheless presented an action plan to reduce its dust emissions.
On June 16, 2013, another dust episode took place in Limoilou. St. Lawrence Stevedoring indicated that the water cannons used to capture dust from transshipments were not in operation at the time. On June 25, residents took note of additional dust coming from the Port, and a complaint was filed. An inspector from Urgence-Environnement arrived on the scene, but could not gain access to the site. The MDDEP subsequently sent a formal notice to St. Lawrence Stevedoring
In August 2013, a new report was posted online by Limoilou residents, featuring further analysis of dust and air samples which showed that dust collected on outside surfaces in Limoilou continued to contain nickel concentrations exceeding public health standards. The report also presented analysis of air samples collected by the MDDEP at various locations in Quebec City, demonstrating that nickel was present in significant concentrations at locations more than five kilometers from the port.
In light of the report's results, a request was made in court for the class-action suit filed in 2013 to be enlarged. Initially, the suit only concerned the October 26, 2012 dust episode, but the amendment included all subsequent episodes. The court rejected the request.
In December 2013, following the publication of a study on nickel dust's effects on human health, the MDDEP tightened the province's limits for atmospheric concentration of the metal. However, as with all ports in Canada, the Port of Quebec is located on federal land. In the wake of the events, St. Lawrence Stevedoring filed an application to the Superior Court to exclude itself from Quebec's environmental standards.
More red dust.
In January 2014, Limoilou residents witnessed more episodes of red dust. Following these allegations, the MDDEP carried out more sampling in Limoilou, the Port of Quebec launched an internal investigation and St. Lawrence Stevedoring distanced itself from all responsibility. Shortly afterwards, following data verification via sensors on its property, the Port of Quebec admitted to having detected higher concentrations of fine particles than usual a few days before the Limoilou residents' report, but still slightly below provincial limits.
On May 1, 2014, the "Le Soleil" newspaper published MDDEP data regarding the atmospheric concentration of nickel in Limoilou and in the adjoining Vanier neighborhood. The data showed that between March 2011 and December 2013, levels were below provincial limits in Vanier, but consistently above the limits in Limoilou, despite a downward trend since fall 2011.
Class-action suit accepted.
Also in May 2014, the Quebec Superior Court heard the request for a class-action suit filed by Limoilou residents against the Port of Quebec and St. Lawrence Stevedoring. The suit requested $150 million, in the form of 5,000 claims of $3,000 each. The request was accepted October 23, 2014.
In January 2015, Limoilou residents obtained copies of reports, published in the 1980s, regarding the environmental repercussions of an eventual extension of the Port of Quebec. A 1981 report mentioned that "the open-air handling of bulk solids on the Beauport flats is a source of air and water pollution." In the same report, the "dustiness" of the Limoilou neighborhood due to port activity had already been identified as problematic. A 1983 report added that air sampling stations on the port grounds had demonstrated suspended particle concentration levels above legal limits. For Limoilou residents working to stop the port's pollution of their neighborhood, the documents demonstrated that the dust issues were neither new nor rare, and that port administration had been aware of the situation.
On January 17, 2015, media outlets reported that St. Lawrence Stevedoring and the Port of Quebec had received citations for obstructing the work of MDDEP inspectors.
Also in January 2015, the MDDEP published information showing that levels of atmospheric concentration of nickel in Limoilou were above provincial limits on average one day per week between January and November 2014.
A second class-action suit against St. Lawrence Stevedoring.
In August 2015, the Court authorized a second class-action suit against St. Lawrence Stevedoring. This suit was much larger than the first, covering damages caused by all dust incidents in Limoilou since 2010.
On September 8, 2016, the Quebec Superior Court gave its decision concerning the applicability of provincial standards on Port of Quebec land, saying that only federal standards applied.
In September 2017, an expert report commissioned by the Port of Quebec and Quebec Stevedoring criticized elements of the class action suit brought forth by Véronique Lalande and Louis Duchesne, questioning the methods by which the dust samples were collected. The report concluded that the ore transshipment at the port was only a marginal source of pollution in the central neighborhoods of Quebec City.

It was preceded by the single "You Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind)", a collaboration with Tanya Tagaq.
Background.
Described by Sainte-Marie as "a collection of front-line songs of unity and resistance," "Medicine Songs" was released November 10, 2017 by True North Records. Produced in collaboration with Chris Birkett, the album features reworked and re-recorded material from throughout Sainte-Marie's career.
Promotion.
As part of the Polaris Collaboration Session series, a video featuring Sainte-Marie and Tagaq performing "You Got to Run (Spirit of the Wind)" was released in February 2017. A music video for "The War Racket" was released in February 2018, animated by Kurt Swinghammer. Sainte-Marie promoted the album in late 2017, giving radio, podcast, print and television interviews where she often reflected on how she was blacklisted by mainstream American radio in the 1960s and 70s, as well as issues related to reconciliation.
Reception.
Described by one reviewer as "unflinching in its focus," "Medicine Songs" was a follow up from 2015's "Power in the Blood". Receiving generally positive reviews, one critic bemoaned the "flattening of time and history" with re-recorded protest songs losing some of the signature features of their times, and with the songs ordered out of chronological sequence.
Awards.
At the Juno Awards of 2018, the album won the award for Indigenous Music Album of the Year. It was also a nominee for Contemporary Roots Album of the Year, but did not win in that category.
The album won the Best Folk Album award at the 2018 Indigenous Music Awards.

Amirtamira

Amirtamira () was a mayor or head of the large cities in feudal Georgia, that enjoyed military and administrative authority. The position was introduced after the initial Arab conquest of Georgia in the mid-7th century, when Abbasid caliphs appointed emirs of Tbilisi. The ascendancy of emirs ended in 1122 when King David IV of Georgia seized the city following his decisive victory at Didgori. Thereafter, the emirs became subordinated to the "Mechurchletukhutsesi" (Finance Minister) of Georgian crown. In the 17th century, the term was replaced by Mouravi. The last amirtamira of Tbilisi was Giorgi Saakadze.
One of the few attempts of third estate to gain power in feudal Georgia can be traced to Qutlu-Arslan, as a Finance Minister, he led a party who proposed an idea of limiting the royal power by a parliamentary-type legislature which, in the view of Qutlu Arslan and his followers, would be consist of two chambers: "Darbazi" (Royal Council) or an assembly that would meet occasionally to follow the developments in the kingdom, and "Karavi", a legislature in permanent sessions. The dispute between the “party of Karavi” and that of the unlimited royal power concluded with the arrest of Qutlu Arslan. In retaliation, the latter’s supporters rose in rebellion, and marched to the Queen’s palace. Tamar agreed to release the oppositionist leader, but his ideas were never materialised. However some other historians believe that in addition to members of the higher secular and ecclesiastical nobility, the "Darbazi" now included representatives of the merchant-class, such as Abulasan.

Mary Becker

Mary Becker is a member of the City Assembly of Juneau, Alaska. She has also been Juneau's mayor and a member of Juneau's school board.
Early years.
Mary Becker earned a bachelor's degree from Albertson College of Idaho. She moved to Juneau around 1966.
Career.
Becker worked as a school teacher from 1967 to 1997.
Becker ran for one of two open seats on the Juneau School Board in 1998. Board members Incumbents Sally Rue and Tom Wagner had decided not to run for reelection. Robert Starbard, Edith McHenry, Jan Marie Ferrell, and Stan Ridgeway were also candidates. Becker said that Juneau needed a new high school, and she advocated for reducing class sizes. She was in favor of a ballot measure to approve sale of $55.5 million in bonds in order to build a high school at Dimond Park for 1,500 students. Becker supported high-school proficiency tests as a way to the academic progress of students. The editorial board of the "Juneau Empire" endorsed her candidacy. Becker and Ridgeway won the election for three-year terms on the Juneau School Board.
During Becker's first term in office, she voted against adding a program to teach life skills to students with disabilities, a program to teach infant care to teenage parents, and a program to help emotionally disturbed students in a new high school being built in Dimond Park. Becker said that having those programs in just one school was sufficient.
Becker voted in favor of a new school policy making it optional for students to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. Becker said that being seated for the Pledge of Allegiance is not respectful, although a policy requiring standing is not worth fighting in court.
In 2001, Becker voted in favor of a teacher's contract that gave current teachers a 4.5 percent raise.
Becker ran for reelection in 2001. Beck said she wanted to stay on the school board in order to be involved in the remodeling of Juneau-Douglas High School, the building of a new high school, and attaining academic standards. Becker won the election.
In January 2002, a teenager held a banner reading "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" across the street from the 2002 Winter Olympics torch relay. The teenager was a student of Juneau-Douglas High School and was across the street from the school while holding the banner. The high school suspended the student for ten days because of the banner. The teenager wanted the suspension expunged from his record, but Becker and the rest of the school board voted to uphold the suspension. The teenager filed a civil-rights lawsuit against the school principal and the school board, claiming his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech had been violated. The case, Morse v. Frederick, ended up going to the United States Supreme Court, and the Court held, 5–4, that the First Amendment does not prevent educators from suppressing, at or across the street from a school-supervised event, student speech that is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.
In 2002, Becker voted against a proposal to buy $25,000 of new equipment for Juneau-Douglas High School's auto mechanics program and to provide $10,000 to the Juneau Community Charter School to help it cover its budget shortfall.
In 2003, Becker voted for a new teachers' contract, giving a two-percent raise to teachers and eliminating 40 teachers' positions during the following two years.
After Juneau residents voted against building a new high school for 1,080 students in Dimond Park in a special election, Becker supported building a school with an 840-student capacity instead. A majority of voters approved the alternative proposal in a subsequent election.
Becker supported a new dress code for students, saying it would improve race relations and improve parental involvement in education.
Becker ran for reelection to the school board in 2004. Becker said she was running for reelection because she wanted to be involved in the building of a second high school in Juneau. She was one of three candidates for two available seats on the school board. The editorial board of the "Juneau Empire" endorsed the other candidates in the race. Becker won reelection to another term in office.

Kyle Goldwin

Kyle Albert Goldwin (born 24 April 1985), also known as Chino, is a Gibraltarian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Lincoln Red Imps and the Gibraltar national football team.
Club career.
Primarily a futsal player after leaving the Lincoln Red Imps youth teams as a youngster, not much is known about Goldwin's career before 2009, when he joined Sporting Club Gibraltar from Laguna. After 4 years with the club, he joined Gibraltar Premier Division side Glacis United in 2013. Chances were limited as the influx of Spanish players after Gibraltar's admission to UEFA, so in 2014 he moved to the newly revived Gibraltar United. At a club with a philosophy of only signing local players, he became first choice as they earned promotion to the Premier Division at the first attempt. In March 2016, he signed a new long term deal to keep him at Gibraltar United for the foreseeable future. In both 2016 and 2017, he was named in Football Gibraltar's Fans XI at the end of season awards. In July 2019, Chino signed for Lincoln Red Imps, where he had been a youth player in the early 00s.
International career.
Goldwin's impressive form for Gibraltar United saw calls for an international callup begin in late 2015. He was first named in a squad for Gibraltar in March 2016 for the games against Liechtenstein and Latvia, but didn't make his debut until 25 March 2018, when he started in a friendly against Latvia at Victoria Stadium. He played the full 90 minutes and earned a clean sheet as Gibraltar won the game 1–0, a rare win for the country.
On 13 October 2018, Goldwin was in goal as Gibraltar recorded their first competitive win in a 1–0 victory over Armenia in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League. This marked his second clean sheet in his first four caps. In keeping the clean sheet Goldwin faced 34 shots including nine by Premier League star Henrik Mkhitaryan who was playing for Armenia.

Marques Townes

Marques Townes (born September 3, 1995) is a Dominican-American basketball player for Pieno žvaigždės Pasvalys of the Lithuanian Basketball League. He played college basketball for the Loyola Ramblers, after beginning his career with Fairleigh Dickinson. A native of Edison, New Jersey, he attended Cardinal McCarrick High School and St. Joseph High School, where he played both basketball and football. Entering the college level, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound guard was a three-star basketball recruit. He drew national attention after helping the Ramblers reach the Final Four round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament.
Early life and high school.
Townes was born in Edison, New Jersey to Bryant and Luisa Townes but grew up in the nearby city of Rahway. While in fifth grade, he moved to South Amboy, New Jersey. Townes began his high school years at Cardinal McCarrick High School in South Amboy, where he played basketball under head coach Joe Lewis. As a sophomore, he averaged 19.2 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, earning first-team All-County honors from "The Star-Ledger" and leading the team to a 22–7 record. At the time, he was being recruited by several major college programs, including Miami, Rutgers, and Virginia.
Before his junior season, Townes announced that he would transfer to St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey, in pursuit of "bigger and better opportunities." He joined a lineup that featured future National Basketball Association (NBA) players Karl-Anthony Towns and Wade Baldwin IV. As a senior, he averaged about 17 points, five rebounds, three assists, and two steals per game, being a third-team All-State pick by "The Star-Ledger". His team, which was ranked the 12th best in the nation by "USA Today", finished with a 30–2 record and won the state's Tournament of Champions for the first time in program history. He accumulated 1,863 points, the most in school history behind Jay Williams.
Townes also saw success on the football field at St. Joseph, where he played the outside linebacker position. He drew interest from various college football programs, such as Penn State, Maryland, and Rutgers, but eventually chose to focus on basketball.
College career.
A three-star recruit, Townes decided to start his college basketball career with the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, turning down offers from Saint Peter's, South Alabama, Hartford, and Charleston Southern.

He led the team to the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, where they lost to Florida Gulf Coast in the First Four round.
After his second season in college, Townes announced that he transfer to play for the Loyola Ramblers. He sat out in the 2016–17 season due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules. On November 24, 2017, he scored a season-high 23 points to help beat UNC Wilmington.

Walloon immigration to Sweden

The history of Walloon immigration to Sweden begins with industrialists Guillaume de Bèche (Willem de Besche; 1573-1629) and Louis De Geer (1587–1652), known as "the father of the Swedish steel industry". Five to ten thousand Walloons emigrated to Sweden, mainly working in the steel industry. During the 1920s, trade unions presented them to Swedish workers as mythical models.
History.
On 28 January 1613, the King of Sweden put an end to the Kalmar War and was forced to make an expensive peace with the King of Denmark. He had to borrow money to pay his debts. In 1616 he approached the Dutch, offering the abundant iron mines of Sweden as collateral. Louis de Geer, from Liège, contacted the Besche brothers, one of whom, Guillaume de Bèche, had been established in Sweden since 1595 and was exploiting the iron works of Nyköping and Finspång with Walloons exiled from the Low Countries for religious reasons.
From 1620, between 5,000 and 10,000 Walloons emigrated to Sweden for economic and religious reasons. The Swedes were amazed by their technical knowhow, which helped them to make great progress in the steel industry. Between 1620 and 1650, Swedish steel exports trebled, reaching 17,500 tons a year, in particular for the English navy. The Walloons’ lifestyle was also ahead of Sweden’s, particularly with regard to hygiene. They remained separate from the Swedish population for a long time, jealously keeping their technical secrets until the end of the 18th century.
Legacy and recognition.
Walloon immigrants were behind Swedish metallurgy from the 17th century onwards and the Walloon language remained spoken in some areas until the 19th century. The impact of Walloon immigration in Sweden was lasting, coming to be embodied in the myth of the Walloon trade-union hero, which corresponds neither to the historic reality of the 17th and 18th centuries nor to the reality of the 1920s in Sweden.
Around 1920, at a time when the Walloon presence was fading, the newspaper of the Swedish metalworkers union gave birth to the myth of the Walloon worker, who was both strong and endowed with a deep class consciousness transposed into the past. This newspaper, "Metallarbetaren", printed these surprising lines (June 3, 1922): Walloons are stronger than the Flemings (the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Belgium), thinner, more nervous, healthier, and they live longer. Their skill and their professionalism are superior to those of the Flemish. They exceed the French in tenacity and enthusiasm - qualities which favoured their immigration in Sweden. But their passionate rashness makes them look like the French people.
Thus was invented the myth of the Walloon capable of trade-union action, in particular by the strike, presented as a model to the Swedes. Anders Florén and Math Isacson, in "De fer et de feu, l’émigration wallonne vers la Suède" (2003), write: "there doubtless existed, in these difficult times of crisis, a strong need for models, and Walloons offered an ideal embodiment of the values which the labor union of the metallurgists intended to promote."

Orhan bey Pojani (1846-1913) was a prominent figure involved in the Albanian National Awakening.
Founded in early 1880s, the magazine "Drita" by 1884 was led by Pojani along with Jovan Kosturi and Thimi Marko while it was distributed throughout Toskëria (southern Albania) and it advocated for Albanian language education in the Tosk dialect. He supported the Albanian educational movement and was also an executor of wealthy benefactor Anastas Avramidhi-Lakçe's will. Pojani was one of four trustees of the boys school in Korçë and in 1903 Ottoman authorities concerned with Albanian education and national sentiments arrested and exiled him to Anatolia. In 1906, Greek bishop Photios was assassinated by an Albanian guerilla band and as Ottoman authorities could not arrest the assassins, Pojani and other Albanian notables involved in the national movement from Korçë were imprisoned but released soon.

Ákos Hadházy was a member of the Fidesz party. He became a local representative in Szekszárd during the 2006 local elections. He was a member of the committee on the economy. He was re-elected in the 2010 local elections. After that he served on the committee on culture. He became nationally known in April 2013, after giving an interview to news portal HVG. In it he confirmed the claims by opposition politicians and journals that the ruling Fidesz government awarded national tobacco sales rights based on party connections, and favoring local pro-government politicians including the mayor of Szekszárd, István Horváth. Horváth denied the charges but HVG presented a leaked audio recording from an assembly of the local representative body, which strengthened Hadházy's allegations. The news portal quoted Horváth who said it was most important that "applicants should be committed conservatives" and "socialist supporters must not win [at the tendering process]".
LMP.
After the interview, Hadházy left Fidesz and its caucus in June 2013, and continued his work as an independent representative. Hadházy became affiliated with the left-wing green party Politics Can Be Different (LMP) by late 2013; he was the party's candidate for the individual parliamentary seat of Szekszárd (Tolna County Constituency I) and came to the fourth place during the 2014 parliamentary election. Soon he officially joined the party. Hadházy ran for the mayoral seat of Szekszárd in the October 2014 local elections. Beside LMP, he was supported by the other left-wing parliamentary parties (MSZP, DK and Together) too. He was defeated by Fidesz candidate Rezső Ács with 5 percent difference (Horváth did not run again for the office). After that Hadházy submitted a protest against the result in the Regional Court of Pécs, presenting evidences about organized tours of voters. The submission was well founded and the court annulled the outcome of the election. A new mayoral election was held on 9 November 2014, and Ács again defeated Hadházy, who obtained 42 percent of the vote.
On 18 July 2015, Hadházy was elected to the LMP's leadership. He launched a portal korrupcioinfo.hu and held weekly press conferences, where uncovered numerous alleged corruption cases involved Fidesz politicians and government—close businessmen and bankers. After the LMP's most well-known politician, András Schiffer announced his retirement from politics, Hadházy was elected co-chair of the party on 16 July 2016, alongside Bernadett Szél. He was also elected a Member of Parliament via the party's national list on 12 September 2016, replacing Schiffer. There he became a member of the Legislative Committee. Hadházy criticized the Orbán government's migrant quota referendum campaign in October 2016; he called the referendum as "destructive", because it "whipped up panic-like fear" among the citizens, while distracting from the "collapsing health care" and the "looting of EU funds at state level". He also said Orbán "isolated himself internationally with his populist campaign of provocation".
During the campaign period of the 2018 parliamentary election, Hadházy was a strong advocate for cooperation among left-wing opposition parties despite the LMP's contradictory resolutions. According to press sources, Hadházy negotiated with numerous individual candidates to step back for the benefit of the most prominent opposition candidate, without authorization of the party leadership. As a result, the LMP's ethics committee initiated proceedings against him, but all of these were covered to the public until the election. Despite Tamás Harangozó (MSZP) withdrew his candidacy in favour of Hadházy, he again lost to Fidesz MP István Horváth in Szekszárd constituency. Hadházy became MP via his party's national list. As the governing Fidesz–KDNP won a two-thirds majority in a row for the third time, Hadházy resigned as co-leader of the LMP at the night of the election day. He was interviewed by 24.hu on the next day, where he claimed former party leader András Schiffer and board secretary Róbert Benedek Sallai threatened party candidates with litigation of million HUF to not to withdraw their candidacy. Both politicians refused the charges. On 14 April, Sallai physically assaulted Hadházy during an ethics committee meeting. Hadházy filed charges against his party colleague due to the attack.
Hadházy refused to attend the opening session of the new parliamentary term on 8 May 2018, claiming the newly formed national assembly as "illegitimate" due to the result of the controversial national election. He took his parliamentary oath a month later, on 4 June. Meanwhile Hadházy was marginalized within LMP. On 24 May, the party's disciplinary banned Hadházy from bearing any party positions for the upcoming two years because of his role in the campaign period of the national election, when he negotiated with the representatives of other parties without authorization. Hadházy left the party on 20 June 2018, but he stated he wish to retain his parliamentary mandate.

Atribacteria

Atribacteria is a candidate phylum of bacteria, which are common in anoxic sediments rich in methane. It was previously known as a candidate edge OP9 or JS1. They are distributed worldwide and in some cases abundant in anaerobic marine sediments, geothermal springs, and oil deposits. Genetic analyzes suggest a heterotrophic metabolism that gives rise to fermentation products such as acetate, ethanol, and CO2. These products in turn can support methanogens within the sediment microbial community and explain the frequent occurrence of Atribacteria in methane-rich anoxic sediments. According to phylogenetic analysis Atribacteria appears to be related to several thermophilic phyla within Terrabacteria or may be in the base of Gracilicutes. According to research, Atribacteria shows patterns of gene expressions which consists of fermentative, acetogenic metabolism. These expressions let Atribacteria to be able to create catabolic and anabolic functions which are necessary to generate cellular reproduction, even when the energy levels are limited due to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the areas of sea waters, fresh waters, or ground waters.
Taxonomy.
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy and List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) were used as the primary taxonomic authority for establishing naming priorities. Also Annotree website, which uses the GTDB release 06-RS202. was consulted.

Charles Foster Hathaway

Charles Foster Hathaway (July 1, 1816 – December 5, 1893) was the founder of the C.F. Hathaway Company, noted American shirt maker.
Hathaway was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to Joshua and Rebecca (Foster) Hathaway. At age 11, he left school to work at Russell's Nail Factory. At age 15, he learned the printer's trade with E. Merriam and Company of West Brookfield, Massachusetts, and later working for G. and C. Merriam of Springfield. On February 18, 1840, at age 23, he mentioned in a letter to his fiancée Temperance Blackwell some details of his work in a "neck stock" shirt factory that had been started in Plymouth by his uncle Benjamin. The two were married in May, 1840, in her hometown of Waterville, Maine, and he apparently returned to work in the Plymouth shirt factory until he sold his share in 1843.
Around 1844 they moved to Waterville, where for three years Hathaway worked for various printers. Then in 1847, for $571.47 he bought good-will, press, type, and stock of a local printing business, and in April of that year published the first issue of the "Waterville Union", a weekly paper of four pages filled with sermons, religious homilies, and moral stories. It lasted only a few weeks, and on July 19, 1847, he sold out to Ephraim Maxham for $475.
In 1848, or perhaps 1850, Hathaway and Josiah Tillson built the Hathaway and Tillson shirt factory at Watertown, Massachusetts. His journal entry for March 31, 1853, notes: "Sold all my property in the firm of Hathaway and Tillson in Watertown to Josiah Tillson for $900." The next day's diary entry reads: "Agreed to go into company in Waterville with [his brother] G.A.H. in July. The firm will be called C. F. Hathaway and Co. I shall put in $4000, he $2000 and have one third of the profits."
Hathaway moved back to Waterville in April 1853, and the C.F. Hathaway Company shirt factory was in operation by October of that year. It was successful as a shirt maker for well over one hundred years, continuing in operation until 2002, although by the time Hathaway died in 1893, others were in control of the factory and he had no management role.
Hathaway is buried in Pine Grove Cemetery, Waterville, Maine.

Castle Hill Park in Cieszyn

The Castle Hill Park is a romantic park created on the initiative of Carl Habsburg in the 1840s on the Castle Hill in Cieszyn, Poland.
History.
A decision to rebuild Castle Hill was taken after the defensive stronghold constructed on it was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War. There are only a few historical sources that inform us about development of the grounds around the castle and allocating them for green areas. A development plan from 1836 indicates that at the upper castle there was a garden of irregular shape with a small square in the centre and four paths going outwards. Between the former upper and lower castle, there was a second garden shaped as an irregular polygon. In 1837 Carl Habsburg ordered the blowing up of the remains of the upper castle and the building of a castle in the Classicist style on the ruins of the lower castle. The new building was a summer residence of the Habsburg called the Hunting Palace of the Habsburg. The park at Castle Hill was designed by Joseph Kornhäusel, the court architect of the Viennese court. In 1914 in the north-west part of the hill artificial ruins were erected to emphasize the romantic nature of the park. Among the trees which grow on in the park on Castle Hill, eight are monuments of nature.

Nick Borkovich

Nick Borkovich (May 30, 1935 – May 19, 2017) was a Canadian justice of the peace who retired from Hamilton's Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2010.
Career.
Known for his fairness and common sense, Nick Borkovich was a Superior court justice in Ontario, who served on the bench for 28 years, starting in 1982. Along with three other judges, he jokingly became part of the "Slavic bench". Walter Stayshyn, Eugene Fedak and William Festeryga were of Ukrainian descent, whereas Borkovich was of Serbian heritage.
Borkovich attended McMaster University and Osgoode Hall Law School with his good friend Walter Stayshyn. Called to the Ontario bar in 1962, Borkovich articled with John Munroe and Jack Pelech. In 1963, Borkovich and Stayshyn opened a law practice in Hamilton.
According to Jaime Stephenson, president of the Hamilton Criminal Lawyers' Association, Borkovich truly believed in the jury system, "He was firm, but also kind and never devalued any participant in the judicial system, ..." However, he also knew when to come down hard, giving a violent child molester one of the harshest sentences ever assigned in Canada.
Background.
Born in Oakville, Ontario to Serbian immigrant parents, Borkovich moved to east Hamilton when he was a child. He graduated from Delta Secondary School where he played baseball and basketball. He carried his love of sports into adulthood, regularly attending football, hockey, and basketball games and later coaching his granddaughter's basketball team.

Verbenol

Verbenol (2-pine-4-ol) is a group of stereoisomeric bicyclic monoterpene alcohols. These compounds have been found to be active components of insect pheromones and essential oils.
Isomers.
Four stereoisomers of verbenol are known. For the "cis" isomer, the two methyl groups (-CH3) are on the same side of the carbon ring as the hydroxy group (-OH), and for the "trans" isomer, they are on the opposite sides. Again, there are enantiomers of each form that exhibit optical activity, that is, turn the plane of linearly polarized light as it passes through the substance or its solution.
"trans"-Verbenol is a mountain pine beetle pheromone that attracts insects to a tree.
"cis"-Verbenol is an aggregation pheromone of "Ips" typographus and "Dendroctonus ponderosae" Hopkins.
Enantiomeric composition.
Typically, verbenol and related cyclic monoterpenes are available as non‐racemic mixtures of their enantiomers. There are methods to increase enantiomeric excess (optical purity) of verbenol and to isolate individual enantiomers.

Parachute Emergency Ration

Parachute emergency rations were a type of United States military ration produced during World War II. The ration was meant as a survival ration for use of aircrew who bailed out of their aircraft. It initially comprised energy bars, fruit bars, K-biscuits, hard candy and lemon-juice powder but eventually evolved into a food pack which contained chocolate, hard candy, bouillon cubes, dehydrated cheese, crackers, sugar, instant coffee and gum, in addition to cigarettes and water-purification tablets. The ration was introduced in 1942 and remained in use until 1952. The ration was placed in the emergency kit fitted to the back or seat of a parachute harness.

Tjay De Barr

Andre Tjay De Barr (born 13 March 2000) is a Gibraltarian footballer who plays for League One side Wycombe Wanderers, and the Gibraltar national football team, as a forward. His cousin is fellow international player Ethan Jolley.
Club career.
De Barr came through the youth system at Lincoln Red Imps, and in early 2015 had a trial at Peterborough United. In 2017 he went on loan to Europa Point to help the newly promoted team in their fight for survival during the 2016–17 season. He played 11 games but could not help the side as they finished bottom of the league. His performances, however, did impress Lincoln manager Julio César Ribas, who opted to use him more often the following season. De Barr won his first senior trophy that September after coming off the bench in the 2017 Pepe Reyes Cup, converting the winning penalty He scored his first senior goal for the Red Imps on 20 February 2018, in a Rock Cup Second Round game against Glacis United. On 29 May 2018 he announced that he would leave the club, signing for rivals Europa in July.
De Barr made his debut for Europa on 12 August 2018, in the 2018 Pepe Reyes Cup game against former club Lincoln Red Imps. He scored an own goal to take the game to penalties, which Europa won to give De Barr his first silverware for the side. After impressing for both his club and national team, in January 2019 it was reported that De Barr had been invited to a trial with an unnamed Portuguese Primeira Liga team, which was later revealed to be Rio Ave. On 19 February, it was revealed that he was on trial with Segunda División side UD Las Palmas. His performances in the latter months of 2018 saw him nominated for "Junior Individual of the Year" at the GBC Sports Awards 2018.
On 21 March 2019, it was revealed that De Barr signed for the 2019–20 season with Spanish club Real Oviedo, being initially assigned to their B-side. The news was confirmed by Europa FC on Twitter later that day. He made his debut as a substitute on 25 August, but was unable to prevent his team losing 4–3 on the opening day of the season against Peña Deportiva. However, his first season at the club was curtailed by a meniscus injury to his left leg in December 2019. With football disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, De Barr returned to limited training on 27 May 2020 with Oviedo's B team. However, continued uncertainty over the return to football in Spain led to De Barr re-joining Lincoln Red Imps on 1 September 2020. Upon his return, he was utilised primarily as a winger with Kike Gómez the lone striker, but his performances attracted the attention of Wycombe Wanderers who invited him for a trial in July 2021.
He signed a one-year deal with Wycombe on 4 August 2021. On 24 August, he made his debut as a substitute against Stevenage in the EFL Cup, scoring a 94th minute equaliser to take the game into extra time before scoring the winning penalty to take the Chairboys through. His style of play and build earned him the nickname "Tevez" from the Wycombe squad.
International career.
De Barr has represented Gibraltar internationally at youth groups from under-16 through to under-21 level. He made his senior debut on 25 March 2018, coming on as a late substitute against Latvia and winning the free kick that Liam Walker converted to give Gibraltar a famous 1–0 win. De Barr subsequently became a regular in the side during their UEFA Nations League campaign, scoring his first international goal on 16 November to break the deadlock against Armenia making him the youngest scorer in the tournament's history as of June 2020. After scoring a penalty against Latvia on 1 September 2021, he became the joint-record scorer for Gibraltar alongside Lee Casciaro.

Chinese Nùng

The Chinese Nùng (Vietnamese: "Người Hoa Nùng" or "Người Tàu Nùng"; Hán-Nôm: 𠊛華農 or 𠊛艚農) are a group of ethnic Han Chinese living in Vietnam. The Chinese Nùng composed 72% to 78% of the population of the Nung Autonomous Territory of Hai Ninh (1947–1954) located in the Vietnamese Northeast, covering parts of the present-day Quảng Ninh and Lạng Sơn provinces.
The Chinese Nùng's name originated from the fact that almost all of them were farmers ("nong nhan" (農人) in Cantonese). After the Treaty of Tientsin, the French refused to recognize this group as Chinese due to political and territorial issues on Vietnam's northern frontier border, therefore the French classified them as Nùng based on their main occupation. The most widely used languages of the Chinese Nùng are Cantonese and Hakka Chinese since they descended from people speaking these languages.
After 1954, more than 50,000 Chinese Nùng led by Colonel Vong A Sang (黃亞生, or Swong A Sang) fled as refugees, joining the 1 million northern Vietnamese who fled south and resettled in South Vietnam, mostly in the Đồng Nai and Bình Thuận provinces. During the Vietnam War, Chinese Nùng soldiers were known for their loyalty to the US Special Forces. They often served as bodyguards to the Special Forces and were regarded as a good source of security for green berets who were recruiting and training locals.
Diaspora.
After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, many of the Chinese Nùng fled Vietnam as boat people political refugees to Hong Kong and Malaysia's refugee camps. Most were resettled in the US, Canada, France, Australia, and Singapore, among other countries.

Gudrun Stig Aagaard

Gudrun Stig Aagaard (1895–1986) was a Danish textile artist who specialized in printed fabrics. She opened her own workshop in 1928, pioneering printed textile designs in Denmark. She initially produced classical patterns but later adopted a more abstract approach in her creations for L.F. Foght. For over 50 years, she collaborated with Haandarbejdets Fremme.
Early life and education.
Born on 13 January 1895 in the village of Torslunde, Ishøj Municipality, Gudrun Stig Aagaard was the daughter of the factory manager Einar Nielsen (1855–1908) and Elisabeth Margrethe Thomsen (1857–1960). She was educated as a weaver in the early 1920s at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Arts and Crafts School for Women) in Copenhagen and at the Académie des Beaux Arts des Tissus in Lyon, France.
Career.
Aagaard first worked in Anton Rosen's textile workshop. After using the batik technique for a number of years, she sought a simpler approach to printing fabrics. She made a number of study trips to England, France and Germany, where she was introduced to textile printing and dye production at IG Farben in Frankfurt. In 1928, she opened her own workshop, producing printed, woven and embroidered goods.
She became particularly interested in the traditional Danish calico print technique known as "kattuntryk". Inspired by the old presses she had found in museums, she developed patterns on linoleum blocks. Unlike her contemporaries who used time-consuming screen printing techniques, in the later 1940s she continued developing calico prints in her workshop, providing the means for her to develop her own expressive patterns. As a result of growing demand in the 1950s, some of her patterns were adapted for screen printing. Aagaard also created patterns for commercial production by the L.F. Foght textile firm. Her most popular patterns based on floral or abstract contoured designs included "Levende Sten" (1950), "Lianer" (1951) and "Mohamed" (1953). Her patterns were carefully produced, combining flowers, leaves, triangles and zigzagging lines. They exhibit discrete, harmonious shades, frequently inspired by plants.
Aagaard's work was exhibited at home and abroad. Items were included in "The Arts of Denmark" exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1960–61) and at the many shows arranged by Haandarbejdets Fremme where she was employed for over 50 years.
Gudrun Stig Aagaard died on 19 April 1986 in Copenhagen.

Bjørn Svendsen

Bjørn Svendsen (c. 1062 – 1100 Rendsburg) was one of the many illegitimate sons of King Sweyn II of Denmark. Unfortunately for him he was one of the younger ones of these sons which put him far down the list of inheriting the throne of Denmark. Bjørn was appointed to various positions of power throughout his older brothers' reigns, and he never caused any trouble being content with what he had. In 1099 at the age of about 37 he was appointed to the very powerful position of Jarl of Nordalbingien. He made fortifications on the island where the town of Rendsburg is cituated. He was killed (with a lance) while presiding a thing the following year by a farmer or nobleman who was upset by the rule of Bjørn. His distant cousin Hakon Sunnivasson eventually avenged Bjørn's murder and became a trusted Jarl of Bjørn’s brother King Eric I of Denmark. 
Bjørn had no known children.

The Southampton Independents was a minor political party of the United Kingdom based in the city of Southampton, Hampshire. The party campaigned on a wide range of local issues such as tower block fire safety after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the failed Solent Devolution Deal and Elected Mayor, housing development and re-generation, the misuse of City Council finances and corruption including the tens of millions of pounds of public money spent on the Council's Arts Complex (see the Party's archived website below). It had one seat on the local council of Southampton City Council, held by Andrew Pope. Pope also contested the Southampton Test constituency in the 2017 General Election finishing fourth of five candidates with 816 votes or 1.7%. Two Southampton Independents candidates stood in the 2018 Southampton City Council election, with Party Leader Denise Wyatt narrowly losing the "safe" Labour Council seat of Redbridge by less than 200 votes. The Party's Millbrook ward candidacy was designed to defeat the Labour Chair of the City Council's Planning and Rights of Way Panel, and former Agent for Basingstoke Conservative MP Maria Miller, Mike Denness. Denness lost his Millbrook seat to the Conservative candidate, Steve Galton, by 63 votes - less than the number of votes received by the Southampton Independents candidate - 91.

Ponerorchis alpestris is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to Taiwan.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1935 by Noriaki Fukuyama as "Amitostigma alpestre". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis alpestris".

Format.
The eighteen group winners have the opportunity to be promoted directly to Segunda División B. The eighteen group winners were drawn into a two-legged series where the nine winners will promote to Segunda División B. The nine losing clubs will enter the play-off round for the last nine promotion spots.
The eighteen runners-up were drawn against one of the eighteen fourth-placed clubs outside their group and the eighteen third-placed clubs were drawn against one another in a two-legged series. The twenty-seven winners will advance with the nine losing clubs from the "champions' series" to determine the eighteen teams that will enter the last two-legged series for the last nine promotion spots. In all the playoff series, the lower-ranked club play at home first. Whenever there is a tie in position ("e.g." like the group winners in the "champions' series" or the third-placed teams in the first round), a draw determines the club to play at home first.
Non-champions Promotion Play-off.
First round.
The teams that finished fourth in their groups are drawn against teams that finished in second place, with the latter hosting the second leg. The teams that finished third in their groups are drawn against each other.
Second round.

Venice of Cieszyn

Venice of Cieszyn () is a part of the Old Town in Cieszyn, Poland. It is a section of contemporary Przykopa Street (formerly "Nad Młynówką") which comprises buildings from the 18th-19th century, many of them with bridges over the course of Młynówka (an artificial canal). In the past the buildings over Młynówka belonged to craftsmen: tanners, weavers, clothiers, leather-dressers and smiths, who needed constant access to water for their craft. It is the area between the intersection of Przykopa Street and Jan Łyska Avenue and the corner of Przykopa and Schodowa streets.
The origin of the name.
It is unknown when exactly the name Venice of Cieszyn entered everyday language. The term is based on a comparison of the street in Cieszyn located near an artificial watercourse with its several bridges over the canal to numerous canals of Italian Venice. There is no official document which would refer to the matter but it is assumed that this term emerged in the second half of the 20th century. The term Przykopa or Młynówka refers to the artificial watercourse at the foot of the scarp on which Cieszyn was founded. Afterwards the names referred to the suburbs of Cieszyn and then to a quarter of the city. The quarter of "Przykopa" was composed of the present streets: Przykopa, 3 Maja, Zamkowa and the Olza River.
Historic monuments register.
Some of the buildings of Venice of Cieszyn are registered in the Register of Historic Monuments of Silesian Voivodeship:
The oldest buildings come from the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. The oldest object in this part of the city is a portal at a descent to the basement of building No. 26 dated back to the 16th-17th century.
History and development.
From the 16th century there was a farm located in the area of Przedmieście (the Suburbs). Its parcelling in the second half of the 17th century contributed to the economic development of this part of Cieszyn. At the end of the 17th century Przedmieście Przykopa was listed in “urbarze” - economic books of the Chamber of Cieszyn kept for the Habsburgs. In the said book from 1692 Przedmieście is described as: "Bey der Wasser thor und an den Mühlgraben", which meant literally: By "the Water Gate and at Młynówka". 35 surnames of property owners are registered there. In the census from 1830 in 42 homes there were 65 households and 290 inhabitants. On 20 March 1849 Przykopa was incorporated by municipal law into the administrative borders of Cieszyn and became a quarter of the city. In the second half of the 19th century in four consecutive population censuses for 1880-1910 there were 50 to 54 properties and the number of inhabitants increased from 561 to 669.
From the 16th century craftsmen settled at Młynówka: potters, clothiers, dyers, weavers and blacksmiths. Most of the buildings served them as their houses, although some of them were merely workshops (e.g. the tannery of Steffan family in the 18th century).
In the Middle Ages near the so-called "Water Gate" and a bridge located near the castle there were baths, which operated here from the end of the 14th century to the 1670s. Later they were relocated to Srebrna street.
The next building was a slaughterhouse, built for the Chamber of Habsburg family in Cieszyn in the second half of the 18th century, which after having bankrupted (due to strong competition) was purchased in 1889 by the "Committee for construction of a bath in Cieszyn". At the site a new building was erected: "The Imperial Baths in Cieszyn" (the name changed later to; "City Baths"), was designed by a local architect Alojzy Jedek. The utility ensured access to public baths for inhabitants of Cieszyn. This was the most popular way of securing hygiene. The baths were liquidated in 1976 after new ones were constructed at Liburnia street.
The most important economic object of Przedmieście Przykopa was the so-called Great Mill, mentioned in 1461 in a document of the Duke of Cieszyn Przemysław II. In the vicinity of the mill were the prince's barns, which served as warehouses for grain and flour. The water mill used the stream of Młynówka to move a water wheel which milled grains of groats and cereals from the prince's farms. The flour produced was sold or used in the castle kitchen. After several fires in the second half of the 17th century, the mill was destroyed and later reconstructed in the 18th century. From that time it fulfilled its purpose to the 1930s. In 1932-1939 the mill was owned by a Jewish married couple Leon and Maria Hochsteinn who opened a water power station there. After World War II the facility was taken over by "Knitting Industry Plant Juwenia", and the power station was liquidated in 1965.
The end of the 19th century is associated with a change in the characteristics of Przykopa from a craftsmen area to an industrial quarter. The first big investment goes back to 1895 - it was the Tannery of Soft and Hard Leather of Zygmunt Kohn. The next were the Iron Furniture and Metal Plates Factory of Jan Juraszek and the Furniture Factory of Jan Tomica. After 1945 there was one more change in the character of the quarter - three industrial plants were built there: Electrical Machinery Factory Celma (near the Freedom Bridge), specialising in the production of motors, a Paints and Varnishes Factory (the middle part of Przykopa quarter) and the "Juwenia facility (located next to the Friendship Bridge)", based on the company of the Kohn family.
Art at the Venice of Cieszyn.
On 4 June 2009 at the Venice of Cieszyn a theatre performance entitled "The Carnival of Venice" took place. The performance was put on by actors of "Teatr Gry and Ludzie" from Katowice as a part of the “Alternative off-stage” that operated simultaneously with the 20th edition of the International Theatre Festival “Without Borders”.

Taha Yasseri

Taha Yasseri (born 6 September 1984) is a physicist and sociologist known for his research on Wikipedia and computational social science. He is an Associate Professor at the School of Sociology at University College Dublin, Ireland. He was formerly a senior research fellow in computational social science at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), University of Oxford, a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute for data science, and a research fellow in humanities and social sciences at Wolfson College, Oxford. Yasseri is one of the leading scholars in computational social science and his research has been widely covered in mainstream media. Yasseri obtained his PhD in theoretical physics of complex systems at the age of 25 from the University of Göttingen, Germany.
Education.
Yasseri was educated at Sharif University of Technology and the University of Göttingen where he was awarded a PhD in physics for research supervised by .
Research and career.
Yasseri's research investigates complex systems, computational social science, network science, social data science and human dynamics.
Wikipedia.
Yasseri has studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology and 9/11 conspiracy theories.
In a study published by "PLoS ONE" in 2012 he estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015.
Machine sociology and bots conflict.
In a 2017 article titled "Even Good Bots Fight", Yasseri and his colleagues studied interactions between . Their work illustrating the unpredictable and somewhat surprising social interactions between bots, ignited a discussion on the topic of machine sociology and the human-like behaviour of systems of semi-autonomous agents such as Wikipedia bots. Drawing on complex systems theory, Yasseri argues that even simple and predictable bots with a common goal and design might show unpredictable emergent behaviour when deployed at mass scale.
Social media and politics.
Yasseri has studied the role of social media in politics. He has used and Google search volumes to understand and potentially predict electoral popularity in different countries. He has co-written "Political Turbulence; How Social Media Shape Collective Action" which was selected among the best politics books of 2016 by "The Guardian" and was awarded the Political Studies Association book of the year award.
TEDx.
Yasseri is a TEDx Thessaloniki 2019 speaker.

Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1936 by Tsin Tang and Fa Tsuan Wang as "Amitostigma amplexifolium". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis amplexifolia".

Vazgen Muradian

Vazgen Muradian (born October 17, 1921 in - d. February 18, 2018) was an Armenian-American 
neo-classicist composer known for having written concerti for every instrument in the orchestra. Among the instruments he is most noted for having created works for are the clarinet, the tuba, the bassoon ("The Big Bassoon") and the Viola d'amore.
Biography.
Born in Ashtarak, Armenia, Muradian was drafted into the Soviet Army during World War II and saw action against the forces of Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front. Following the Soviet collapse against the invading German army he became a refugee from both Nazis and the Soviets and performed with the Stanislav Symphony Orchestra, the Lvov Opera, and on the vaudeville stage in Warsaw. His travels during this period also brought him to Berlin and Vienna and finally to Venice, where he settled in to study. In Venice he enrolled at the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia and while there studied composition with Gabriele Bianchi, violin with Luigi Ferro, and Viola d’amore with Renzo Sabatini.
1948 saw Muradian graduate from the conservatory with a degree as a Professor of music and still in Venice he took a position teaching at the Moorat Raphael College. In 1950 he left Italy and transplanted himself to the United States where he resided until his death in 2018 and where he wrote all of his major musical compositions. Henceforth he played violin in several musical ensembles including the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra. He then removed himself as an orchestra member to focus solely upon composition. His works have been performed by the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra, the Chicago Chamber Orchestra, the Little Orchestra Society of New York, the New Jersey Association of Verrisimo opera, and the Viola d’amore Society of America, among others.
Muradian is known for having composed for every instrument in the classical orchestra as well as others not included in it. As of his seventieth birthday in 1991 he had composed 62 concerti for 35 different instruments. "The Guide to the Tuba repertoire", published by Indiana University Press and edited by R. Winston Morris refers to his "Concerto for Tuba and Orchestra, Opus 85" as ..."A melodic neo-romantic work which takes the soloist through much o,xf their range in a mostly diatonic fashion. The music contains passion reminiscent of the composer's homeland"...
Vazgen Muradian resided in New York City until his death in February 2018. He was predeceased by his wife Arpi. Together they have two sons, Armen Morian and Vardges "Vago" Muradian and two grandchildren. His brother was the Armenian poet Gevorg Emin.

Battle off Yarmouth (1777)

The Battle off Yarmouth took place on 28 March 1777 during the American Revolutionary War off the coast of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The battle is the first American armed vessel to engage the British Navy. The British vessel forced the American aground and the American crew escaped among the inhabitants of Yarmouth. 
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal.
Battle.
Three American vessels (brigantines) – "Massachusetts" (Captain John Fisk), (Captain Jonathan Harriden) and the brig "Cabot" (Captain Olney) - were sailing toward Nova Scotia and were confronted at 11:00 pm by HMS "Milford". They waited until morning before they decided to attack. During the morning hours "Cabot" had been separated from the other two ships. Then the weather became "thick and rainy" until 6:00 pm. When the weather cleared "Milford" pursued "Cabot". The wind and waves remained high and the pursuit lasted for several days and nights. Captain Olney realized "Cabot" was being overtaken and steered to the Nova Scotia shore and beached the vessel near Chebogue River, a short distance from Yarmouth.
Aftermath.
The crew of 140 got safely to shore and escaped into the village of Chebogue. Local residents Captain Zacharias Foot and his nephew Captain Richard Valpey housed and fed thirty of the crew for a few weeks until they were able to secure a vessel back to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. One observer noted that Captain Foot's "unbounded liberality to American prisoners is Well known to many." On separate occasions, Foot and Valpey were later imprisoned by the Americans. Captain Olney advocated for Foot's release, which was successful. After this period, Foot continued to trade with Boston the release of American prisoners for other goods and supplies. American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. For example, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, American privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.
"Milford" took 14 days to get "Cabot" afloat and then sent it to Halifax.

Chiara Mingarelli is an Italian-Canadian astrophysicist who researches gravitational waves. She is an associate research scientist at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Astrophysics and an assistant professor of physics at the University of Connecticut. She is also a science writer and communicator.
Education.
Mingarelli grew up in Ottawa, Canada. She completed a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Carleton University, Canada, in 2006. She moved to the University of Bologna to study for a Masters in Astrophysics and Cosmology, which she achieved in 2009. Mingarelli's PhD thesis "Gravitational Wave Astrophysics with Pulsar Timing Arrays", was selected by Springer Nature as an "Outstanding PhD thesis" in 2016. She earned her PhD at the University of Birmingham with Alberto Vecchio in 2014.
Research.
Mingarelli is a gravitational wave astrophysicist attempting to understand the merging of supermassive black holes. Mingarelli predicts the nanohertz gravitational wave signatures of such mergers. She will measure them using pulsar timing arrays, which can characterise the cosmic merger history of binary black hole systems. The systems emit nanohertz gravitational waves. After completing her PhD, Mingarelli was awarded a European Union Marie Curie International Fellowship, which she brought to the California Institute of Technology. There she continued to work on gravitational waves. At Caltech she taught students in the Gravitational Wave Astrophysics school about Pulsar Timing Arrays. Mingarelli spent the return phase of the Marie Curie Fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. She is regularly an invited speaker at scientific conferences.

Mingarelli appeared on Stargazing Live in 2012. She was featured on the BBC Radio Cambridgeshire show The Naked Scientists. In 2013 the Royal Astronomical Society selected Mingarelli as a "Voice of the Future", and she attended an interview session at the House of Commons. She regularly appears on science themed podcasts and video series. She has been involved with Amy Poehler's Smart Girls, as a blogger and interviewee. After the first detection of gravitational waves, Mingarelli was featured in The New York Times. She has contributed to popular science journals, including Scientific American, Nautilus, The Wall Street Journal, Gizmodo, Wired and the New Scientist. Mingarelli maintains a social media presence on sites such as Twitter, where she is an advocate for "science, coffee and girl power".

<doc id="56939350" url="?curid=56939350" title="Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore">
Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore

The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore (1890-1941) grew out of the tradition of women’s clubs that flourished in late nineteenth-century America. A number of literary societies founded throughout the country during this time provided women a chance to read and discuss literature in a supportive setting. These clubs originated to fill a void left by the limited educational opportunities for girls. The Women's Literary Club of Baltimore differed from the majority of women's clubs, however, in focusing on getting their work published. The group provided mutual support for one another, not just in their study of literature but to support each other’s efforts in pursuing literary careers. Over the course of its existence, hundreds of works by Club members were published in magazines, newspapers, and by major book publishers.
The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore was founded in March 1890, and was the idea of two young writers, Louisa C.Osburne Haughton and Hester Crawford Dorsey, who issued an invitation to discuss founding a club “to further greater intellectual development of the women of Baltimore and to promote social relations among those of similar tastes.” Nearly 40 women responded. One of the first orders of business at the initial meeting was the selection of a name. The inclusion of Woman in the club’s title was significant. Not only did it identify the membership; it also announced the belief that women writers were different from their male counterparts. Club members took as their motto “Parole Femine” (womanly words), a phrase from the Maryland state motto. They believed that women writers brought a different sensibility to their work and could raise the standards of literature.
The Club founders were serious in purpose and set out a formal structure through which to achieve their goals. Their Constitution enumerated the duties and responsibilities of officers and members. The Club was run by elected officers, who formed the Club’s Board of Managers. Membership in the Club was limited at first to women “who had a sufficient interest in literature to have devoted some time and thought to original work for either newspapers or magazines or of a more lasting nature”; all eleven of the Club’s founding members were published authors. The requirement that members be published authors eventually eased, and women interested in literary pursuits were offered membership. At its 30th anniversary, it was noted that the Club had been eager to recognize and foster young talent. Publication, however, remained an important goal for the Club, and the president’s remarks often praised the publication successes of its members. Some of the best-known writers affiliated with the Club included Lizette Woodworth Reese, Margaret Sutton Briscoe, Louise Malloy, and Harriet Lummis Smith.
The Club met weekly, on Tuesday afternoons, between October and the first week in June, leaving the summer months free for members to escape the city heat in travel or stays at summer homes. The Club never owned a clubhouse, as was common for clubs at this time. They remained a fairly small group, capping their membership at 100, and while this allowed them funds for their activities, it would not support the purchase and maintenance of a building. Instead, the group affiliated with the Maryland Academy of Sciences in 1891 as associate members, and were allowed to establish their meeting room in the Academy’s building. The Academy moved several times in the Club’s early years, but when they finally moved to 105 West Franklin Street, the former mansion of Maryland governor Thomas Swann, the Club was provided with a comfortable meeting space until 1921, when they began meeting in a room at the Arundell Club at 1000 N. Charles Street.
The heart of the Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore was its committees, where the members tested their literary works to be presented at the weekly meetings. Each member was required to belong to at least one committee, but it was recommended they not belong to more than two so as to have time to give adequate attention to the committee work. The committee chair selected the topics and organized the discussions, debates and critical analysis of members’ work. The committee setting was where the members presented their work and received, as one member put it, “a baptism of friendly criticism.” In committee sessions some members shared poems, short stories, book chapters, translations, or an act from a play. Others wrote papers on artistic movements, music and musicians, or historical events. After thorough vetting by the committee, papers deemed ready for wider hearing were selected by the committee chair and presented at a weekly meeting of the Club. The committees, and their plans of work, varied from year to year depending on the chair. The committees that presented programs to the Club most often were those dealing with literature: Fiction, Modern Poetry, Drama, Essays, Current Criticism and Translation. Three long-standing committees were Art, Music, and Education. American history was of great interest to the members, supporting committees in Colonial and Revolutionary History, Letters and Autographs, and “Unfamiliar Records.” Archaeology, the specialty of longtime Club president Letitia Yonge Wrenshall, was a long-standing committee.
In addition to weekly meetings, the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore held salons, which were social events with a musical program and refreshments. Members were permitted to invite guests, male or female, to attend. The Home Committee was in charge of decorating the rooms and providing the refreshments. To provide inspiration for members, the Club maintained a library of books written by themselves as well as their fellow Maryland authors.
Each January beginning in 1902, the Club held an annual Twelfth Night Celebration, an elaborate dinner with a musical program and a Christmas cake baked with souvenirs that was paraded through the gathering. On All Souls’ Day, November 2, the Club members decorated the graves of authors and artists buried in Maryland. Among those honored were Edgar Allan Poe, Junius Brutus Booth, John Pendleton Kennedy, Sidney Lanier, Col. Richard Malcolm Johnston, William H. Rinehart, and former Club member Mary Spear Tiernan. In 1907, members of the WLCB organized the Edgar Allan Poe Memorial Association in advance of the centennial of his birth in 1909.
The Club did not admit black members, though at least one Jewish woman belonged (Henrietta Szold, who later founded the Zionist women's organization Hadassah); and while some of its members strongly supported suffrage, no mention of the Club's participation in suffrage activities is recorded.
The Woman’s Literary Club of Baltimore completed its final season in May 1941. Louisa C. Osburne Haughton, one of the originators of the Club, served as president for its final 23 years. Notices of meetings and events published in the Baltimore "Sun" indicate that the Club stayed true to its mission of supporting women writers and their literary pursuits.

Shooting of Yassar Yaqub

The death of Yassar Yaqub occurred on the evening of 2 January 2017 near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Yaqub was a passenger in a car stopped by police on a sliproad near junction 24 of the M62 motorway and was fatally shot by a West Yorkshire Police firearms officer.
Mohammed Yaqub, Yaqub's father, paid for additional private autopsy and ballistics tests and insisted that his son was doing "nothing wrong" at the time of the shooting.
During the 2018 trial at Leeds Crown Court the driver of the car, Mohsin Amin, was found guilty of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The two other males, David Butlin and Rexhino Arapaj were cleared of firearms charges but Butlin was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon – a push dagger.
Yaqub was in one of two cars traveling in a convoy when four unmarked police vehicles stopped them at junction 24 of the motorway in Huddersfield. While Amin obeyed police instructions, Yaqub had crouched down and as he brought his hands back up the officer was "under no doubt he was holding a handgun", The Judge told Amin at sentencing: "You knew that Yassar Yakub had a gun, which you both intended should be used in a way that endangered life in a preconceived and imminent way."
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was evidence of "an ongoing drug feud".
Journalist Mobeen Azhar has created a BBC documentary series and a BBC Sounds podcast about the case, both called "". They aired from 2019–2020.

Matisse Thybulle

Matisse Vincent Thybulle (born March 4, 1997) is an Australian-American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected in the first round of the 2019 NBA draft with the 20th overall pick. In 2021, he was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team.
Thybulle played college basketball for the Washington Huskies. As a senior in 2019, he was recognized as the top defender in the nation with the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year and the Lefty Driesell Award. Thybulle also earned first-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12, and repeated as the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year.
Thybulle is a dual American-Australian citizen and spent around seven years of his childhood in Sydney. He is a member of the Australian national team at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
Early life.
Thybulle was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, the son of Greg, a Haitian-born engineer raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York, and Dr. Elizabeth Thybulle, a naturopath who died of leukemia in 2015. He was named after French artist Henri Matisse. When he was two, his family moved to Sydney, Australia, where they lived for around seven years. Thybulle did not play much basketball in Australia. He was more interested in swimming there, where he said lifeguards "were a really big deal". His family returned to the U.S. in 2005 and settled in Sammamish, Washington, a suburb east of Seattle.
Thybulle could not make layups consistently until around the eighth grade, when his coordination began matching his speed. He attended Skyline High School for two years, then transferred to nearby Eastside Catholic, where he was ranked a four-star recruit by Scout.com and three-star by ESPN, and graduated in 2015.
College career.
Thybulle chose to attend the University of Washington in Seattle based on his relationship with Huskies coach Lorenzo Romar. He started all 34 games as a true freshman in 2015–16, averaging 6.2 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.6 assists in 24.1 minutes per game. As a sophomore in 2016–17, he averaged 10.5 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 2.1 steals, but the Huskies won only two games in conference and were in Romar's fifteenth season at Washington, and he was fired.
Thybulle considered leaving the program after his coach left. However, he decided to return for 2017–18 after meeting with new coach Mike Hopkins. The former 22-year Syracuse assistant under Jim Boeheim sold him on the Orange's acclaimed 2–3 zone defense that he planned to install at Washington. On February 17, Thybulle scored a career-high 26 points in an 82–59 win over Colorado. Possessing a wingspan, he was instrumental to the Huskies' zone defense, which was a key to the team's first 20-win season since 2011–12. He was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the first player in school history to receive the honor. Thybulle averaged a career-high 11.2 points per game, set a Huskies single-season record with 101 steals, and led Washington with a team-leading 49 blocks. He became the second player in Pac-12 history with at least 90 steals and 40 blocks in the same season, joining Jeff Trepagnier (USC, 1999–2000).
In 2018–19, Thybulle had 17 points, six steals and five blocks in a 64–55 home win over Colorado to help the Huskies clinch a share of the Pac-12 regular season title. Including a win earlier in the week against Utah, he averaged 13.5 points, 6.0 steals, 4.5 blocks and 5.0 rebounds to earn Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career. Thybulle won the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year and Lefty Driesell Award as the top defensive player in the nation. He was also named first-team All-Pac-12, and became the second player in conference history to repeat as Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year. He led all NCAA Division I players with 126 steals, which also broke the Pac-12 single-season record held previously by Jason Kidd. Thybulle also ranked eighth nationally with 83 blocks, becoming the only player in the past two decades to record at least 100 steals and 80 blocks. With averages of 3.5 steals and 2.3 blocks per game, he was one of three players in the last 20 years to average at least 2.0 steals and 2.0 blocks in a season. Thybulle also passed Gary Payton to become the conference leader in career steals with 331, and was the first in Pac-12 history with two 100-steal seasons. He also tied Washington's career blocks record of 186 held by Chris Welp, and he is the only player in Huskies history ranked in the top 10 in both career steals and blocks.
Professional career.
Philadelphia 76ers (2019–present).
The Philadelphia 76ers targeted Thybulle leading up to the 2019 NBA draft. They were coming off a second-round playoff loss to the eventual NBA champions, the Toronto Raptors, and were seeking someone who could immediately contribute to their goal for a championship. The 76ers had Thybulle stop working out for others teams, promising in exchange to select him in the first round with their No. 24 overall pick. They effectively ended up moving up to No. 20 to select him, receiving his draft rights from the Boston Celtics in a trade for Philadelphia's 24th and 33rd picks. On July 3, 2019, Thybulle signed with the 76ers. On October 23, he made his debut in NBA, coming off from bench in a 107–93 win over the Celtics with three points, a rebound, an assist, two steals and two blocks. After scoring 20 points, hitting five three-pointers, and making three steals in a win over the Raptors on December 8, he joined Allen Iverson as the only Sixers rookies to record five threes and three steals in a game since 1983. On July 11, 2020, Thybulle started uploading a series of vlog style YouTube videos showcasing the 2020 NBA Bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida.
In his second season in 2020–21, Thybulle was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, though he only averaged 20 minutes per game. He was the NBA leader with 3.8 steals per 100 possessions as well as 5.6 deflections per 36 minutes.
National team career.

Trio (1801 ship)

Trio enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1802 with Shannon, master, Greenock, owner, and trade Dublin. She became a slave ship but the French Navy captured her in January 1806 early in her first slave trading voyage.
Capture.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1806 lists "Trio" with "J. Haster", master, Johnson, owner, and trade Liverpool–Africa. Captain James Hassler sailed from Liverpool on 21 September 1805, bound for West Africa. "Lloyd's List" reported on 8 April 1806 that a French squadron consisting of an 84-gun ship-of-the-line and three frigates had captured "Trio", , and the sloop-of-war off the coast of Africa.
L'Hermite's squadron captured "Trio" in January off Sierra Leone. The French made a cartel of her and she arrived at Falmouth on 7 April 1806 with the crew of "Favourite", which the French had captured on 6 January. She then sailed on to Plymouth. The entry for "Trio" in "Lloyd's Register" has the notation "captured" above her name.
Spilsbury's log.
Francis P. Spilsbury was the surgeon aboard "Favorite" and he kept a log of her voyage to Africa. 
The French captured "Trio" on 22 January at Cape Mount. The French swept into the bay where they found "Trio" and three American vessels. "Trio" fired a gun and then struck. The French sold the female slaves "Trio" had gathered to the Americans and divided the male slaves among the French vessels. The French made a cartel of "Trio", and on 24 January, after looting almost all the possessions of "Favorite"s crew, put her crew on board "Trio". The French also put on board the crews of "Trio", "Robert", of Liverpool, "Hero", of Glasgow, "Flora", of London, and "Belle", of Greenock. L'Hermite provided sufficient provisions for 150 men for five days. On the 25th some of the men from the merchantmen became mutinous. Captain John Davie, of "Favourite", read the Articles of War and gave the ringleaders 36 lashes each; this ended the mutiny. "Trio" had 160 men aboard and reached Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 2 February. "Trio" reached Crookhaven on 29 March where she took on provisions. However, "Trio"s mate and surgeon deserted. "Trio" reached Falmouth on 8 April.
Post script.
Under the rules governing cartels, "Trio" would probably have sailed on to France, carrying French prisoners in exchange for the British prisoners she had brought. Although the Registers continue to list "Trio" until 1810, the data is stale, unchanging from 1806.

Villa Gropallo dello Zerbino

Villa Balbi Durazzo Gropallo "Dello Zerbino" is a 16th-century villa in Genoa, Italy. It is situated in the quarter of Castelletto, near Galeazzo Alessi's Villa delle Peschiere. It was constructed from 1599 to 1603 as a suburban villa for the Genoese noblemen Stefano Balbi, ambassador to Milan, and Giovanni Battista Balbi. The name Zerbino is derived from the Ligurian word "zerbo", meaning "uncultivated"— at the time when the villa was built, the surrounding area was still outside of the city walls and uncultivated. In the 18th century it passed to Marcello III Durazzo, then to the Gropallo family. It is now owned by the Castelbarco Albani family and used as a venue for events and exhibitions.
History.
The villa was built from 1599 to 1603 as summer house for the Genoese noblemen Stefano Balbi, ambassador to Milan, e Giovanni Battista Balbi. In In the 18th century it passed to Marcello III Durazzo and. at the beginning of the 19th century, the Durazzo family commissioned to the architect Emanuele Andrea Tagliafichi the enlargement and landscaping of the garden. In the second half of the 19th century, the villa remained untouched by the urban expansion of the city, which surrounded it without compromising the unity of the monumental site. At the end of the century the villa passed to the Gropallo until the last descendant of the family, the marquess Laura Gropallo della Sforzesca left it in 1995 to her two sons Cesare e Marcello Castelbarco Albani. The villa is now used as a venue for meetings, events and exhibitions.
Description.
Architecture.
The architecture of the villa follows the traditional tri-partition of the façade, common in Genoa at the time under the influence of Galeazzo Alessi. Also the internal distribution is a typical one, centered around the main rooms.
Decoration.
The internal decoration, still well preserved, includes the 17th century frescoes at the piano nobile by Domenico Piola and Gregorio De Ferrari, the latter credited with the most notable fresco in the central room, featuring "Time and the Seasons." On the ground floor, renovated in the neoclassical style 18th century by Tagliafichi, there is a large room opened to the garden and decorated by Giovanni Barabino and Michele Canzio.
Garden.
The park was remodeled at the beginning of the 19th century by Tagliafichi, with terraces, staircases, a nymphaeum and a romantic grotto. The nobleman Ippolito Durazzo, retired to private life after the fall of the Republic of Genoa in 1815, dedicated himself to the development of a botanical garden.

Zeke Upshaw

Zena Ray "Zeke" Upshaw (May 27, 1991 – March 26, 2018) was an American professional basketball player. He began his college basketball career with the Illinois State Redbirds. After playing sparingly for three seasons, he transferred to join the Hofstra Pride, where he led the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in scoring and was named second-team all-conference. Upshaw played professionally in Slovenia and Luxembourg before returning to the United States and joining the Grand Rapids Drive of the NBA Development League (now known as the G League). In the Drive's regular season finale in 2017–18, he collapsed on the court in the game's final minute and died two days later.
High school career.
Upshaw was born in Chicago. As a child, he gravitated toward basketballs at Toys "R" Us over all the other toys in the store. He began playing organized basketball when he was six. Upshaw attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where he averaged 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists as a junior in 2008, when he was named the most valuable player (MVP) of the Independent School League.
College career.
After redshirting his first year at Illinois State University (ISU), Upshaw played three years for the Redbirds, albeit with minimal playing time. He averaged 1.6 points per game, while never averaging more than 7.4 minutes played per game. He graduated from Illinois State with a degree in apparel, merchandising and design in 2013, but transferred to Hofstra for his final season of NCAA eligibility. Upshaw exercised the graduate transfer exception, which enables players who have already received their degree but have eligibility remaining to be able to play immediately at another school while studying for a post-graduate degree in a discipline that was not available in their previous school. He was seeking a school where he could be an "impact player and have an opportunity to [play professionally] overseas or somewhere."
After receiving his release from ISU, Upshaw was originally recruited by Niagara coach Joe Mihalich. However, the coach left soon for Hofstra, where he told Upshaw the opportunity to play was even higher because four players had been kicked off the team after a burglary incident. On January 15, 2014, Upshaw scored 27 points and tied a Pride record with seven three-pointers in a 69–64 win over UNC-Wilmington. He led the CAA in scoring at 19.8 points per game, and earned second-team All-CAA honors. His 17.3 points per game increase over his 2.5 average from 2012–13 was the largest increase in Division I basketball.
Professional career.
After going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, he passed on the option to enter the NBA Development League Draft. Instead, he signed with Helios Suns of the Premier A Slovenian Basketball League in September 2014. In 30 games for Helios in 2014–15, he averaged 9.8 points and 3.2 rebounds per game.
In August 2015, Upshaw signed with Basket Esch of Luxembourg's Total League for the 2015–16 season. In 27 games, he averaged 20.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.
After deciding to enter the 2016 NBA Development League Draft, Upshaw was selected in the fourth round by the Grand Rapids Drive. In 34 games for the Drive in 2016–17, he averaged 6.5 points and 3.0 rebounds per game.
Death.
On March 24, 2018, Upshaw scored 11 points in the regular-season finale to earn a playoff spot for Grand Rapids in a 101–99 home win over the Long Island Nets. In the game's final minute, however, he collapsed and was taken off the court at DeltaPlex Arena on a stretcher. Paramedics started cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance, seven minutes after his collapse, and his heart did not start again until 40 minutes later in the hospital. Two days later on March 26, Upshaw died in Spectrum Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at the age of 26. The Kent County medical examiner's preliminary determination after conducting an autopsy was that Upshaw had a sudden cardiac death. It was later expanded to state Upshaw had "cardiac abnormalities" that his family had no prior knowledge of. Out of respect for Upshaw, the NBA G League delayed the first round of the 2018 playoffs, while the Detroit Pistons gave him an honorary call-up to the team on March 29 for their game against the Washington Wizards.
On May 30, 2018, Upshaw's parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the NBA, the Detroit Pistons, the SSJ Group, who owns the Grand Rapids Drive, and the DeltaPlex Arena. Afterwards, the "Detroit Free Press" reported that a year earlier, he had fainted and been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the chief cause of heart-related deaths of young athletes in the U.S. and which, combined with over-exertion, is believed to have killed him.
In July 2019, the NBA and the Detroit Pistons settled a lawsuit with Upshaw's family.

At this point the width of the strait is The midpoint of the gulf is known as "Karanlık Liman" ("Dark Harbor") Administratively is a part of Çanakkale Province.
The gulf in the World War I.
During the initial naval operations carried on by the Allies of World War I in 1914 November and 1915 February, Ottoman defenders observed that the Allied ships used the gulf of Erenköy as a maneuvering space. When a ship was returning she was using the gulf to veer, in order not to block the other ships following her.
Before the main naval assault on 18 March 1915, the Ottoman minelayer "Nusret", under the command of Captain Hakkı and Captain Nazmi, was tasked to lay naval mines in the gulf. The strait was already mined as this was expected by the Allies. Additionally, 26 mines were laid in the Gulf of Erenköy parallel to the coast line unobserved by the Allies. The Turkish military became aware of the practice of the Allies battleships making a turn-back manoeuvre in the gulf when they face heavy artillery fire.
On 18 March 1915, during the main assault of the Allies, four Allies battleships, French battleship "Bouvet", , and were struck by the mines in the gulf. Among these, both "Bouvet" and "Irresistible" were already hit by the artillery in Turkish redoubt before striking the mine.

Oskélanéo River

The Oskélanéo River is a tributary of the South Bay of Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir), flowing into the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.
The Oskélanéo River runs successively in the cantons of Faucher and Achintre. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The route 404, connecting the village of Clova, Quebec to the South Bay of Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir) serves the lower part of the Oskélanéo River; this road connects to the south-east the route 400 which goes to Gouin Dam. Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of the Oskélanéo River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.
History.
Thanks to the arrival of the Transcontinental Railway around 1910, Oskelaneo River Station contributed to the development of the village of Oskélanéo. The main economic activity was forestry. Nevertheless, recreational tourism activities developed rapidly, notably with the first raising of the Gouin Reservoir level in 1918, then the second raising in 1948. Given the current level of water in the lake, the village of Oskélanéo offers access to boating a direct access road to Gouin Reservoir down the Oskélanéo River. In the past, prior to the development of motorized forest roads, travelers were getting off the train at the Oskelaneo River station and using the services of outfitters for hunting and fishing trips.
Toponymy.
Until 1918, when the erection of the La Loutre Central, which will create the first level designated then Gouin Reservoir, the Oskélanéo River was considered to be one of the tributaries of the Saint-Maurice River), feeding the Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir).
This hydronym appears in cartographic documents at least since the first half of the 19th century, i.e. on the map of Charles Magnus (1857), in the form of Oskelanaio, then that of Eugène Taché in 1870. In 1914, this river was designated Escalana by Eugène Rouillard and on maps in particular in 1935. The designation "Escalona" is also indicated on maps of 1924 and 1926. Escalana (or Escalona) derives from oskélanéo which is an Algonquin word meaning "bones".
Nevertheless, some sources consider that oskélanéo results from the deformation and fusion of the words tchiask, meaning "gull", and sakegane, meaning "lake"; consequently, this hydronym would be translated as "gull lake" or "gull flight". In Atikamekw, the Oskélanéo River becomes "Kiackoranan Sipi", meaning "river of the gull caught in the net". One [Canadian National] railway station has been designated "Oskelaneo River". The term "Oskelaneo", alone, was the name of a post office (1921-1973) serving what is now a hamlet.
The toponym "Oskélanéo River" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Haiti during World War I

Following the United States declaration of war on Germany (1917), the Haitian government protested against the heavy German U-boat submarine activity in the area, and officially declared war on July 12, 1918.
United States occupation of Haiti.
The United States occupation of Haiti began on July 28, 1915, when 330 US Marines landed at the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, on the authority of United States President Woodrow Wilson. The July Intervention took place after the murder of dictator President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam by insurgents angered by his political executions of his political opponents.
Vilbrun Guillaume Sam.
Vilbrun Guillaume Sam (March 4, 1859 - July 28, 1915) was President of Haiti from March 4 - July 27, 1915.
The culmination of the repressive measures came on July 27, 1915, he was responsible for the ordered the execution of 167 entire political prisoners, including Sam former president Zamor, who was being held in a Port-au-Prince jail. This infuriated the population, which rose against Sam government as soon as news of the executions reaching them.
Sam fled to the French Embassy, when he received asylum. The Haitian rebels' mulatto leaders broke into the embassy and Sam was found. The rebels dragged him out and beat him senseless to death and then threw his limp body over the embassy's iron fence to the waiting populace, who then ripped his body to pieces and paraded the part through the capital's neighborhoods. In two weeks the country was in chaos.

He became the president after the Invasion of Haiti by the United States. Dartiguenave continued Haiti's participation in World War I alongside France and the United States in World War I. with the victory of the Triple Entente, Haiti was a victorious ally in 1918. The credit then returned to President Dartiguenave.
Following the United States' entry into World War I, the Haitian government protested against the heavy German submarine activity in the area. Haiti expelled all Germans from the country and the German Empire broke off diplomatic relations with Port-au-Prince on June 16, 1917.
Entry into World War I.
A month after the United States declared war, Haitian President Dartiguenave asked the Haitian Congress for a declaration of war because of the destruction by a German submarine of a French steamer which had among its crew and passengers Haitian citizens. Congress refused but a few days later adopted a resolution condemning unrestricted submarine warfare and empowering the president to break off diplomatic relations with Germany if that country refused 
reparations and guarantee for the future. Haiti eventually declared war in July 1918.

Helen Campbell D'Olier

Helen Campbell D’Olier (1829 - 1887) was a Scottish artist best known for her reproductions from early-Christian illuminated manuscripts.
Life and family.
Born in Edinburgh, the daughter of James Lawson, she received some instruction in drawing and painting from William Simpson RSA. In 1849 she moved to Ireland having married Dublin barrister John Rutherford D’Olier (1816-1899). They had two children Helen Lawson D'Olier (d. 1948) and Isaac Matthew D'Olier (1850-1913). D'Olier died on 29 June 1887.
Artistic work.
While she did produce some traditional landscape paintings, it is for her skill in reproducing illuminations from medieval manuscripts and particularly from the Book of Kells for which this artist is best remembered. Her copies, on vellum, of the illustrations in the 9th-century Book of Kells, are noted for their accuracy and fidelity. D'Olier spent many years copying these illustrations, at a time when copyists were permitted to work directly from the manuscript itself. It can be seen, from her surviving drawings, that D'Olier had been permitted to trace the designs directly from the pages of the manuscript.
Apart from her meticulous reproductions D'Olier researched the history of the manuscripts, particularly the origins of the pigments used to decorate them. In 1884 she lectured on the subject in Alexandra College, showing magic-lantern slides of her work. Some of her illustrations were included in a lecture on the Book of Kells given by Professor J.D. Westwood in Oxford, which was published in 1887. Her work was also included in a paper read to the Dublin Society in 1887 by Professor W.J.Hartley She is known to have worked on the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Bodleian's Liber Sacramentorum. Her work was exhibited in the Dublin Exhibition of 1861 and 1872.
In 1914 Sir Edward Sullivan (1852-1928) produced a very popular book on the Book of Kells with 24 full-colour plates. At the time it was technically easier to reproduce drawings than photographs in illustrated books, and so the images used in Sullivan's book were made by Helen D'Olier. James Joyce is known to have owned a copy of this book which he took with him wherever he went. He told Arthur Powers (1891-1984) that the Book of Kells was ‘the most purely Irish thing we have’ and that he 'pored over' Sullivan's book 'for hours'. When Joyce was exclaiming in "Finnegans Wake" over the ""'Tunc page', as he calls Matthew 27:38, he was in fact basing his observations on images made by D'Olier.

Aydan Murtezaoğlu

Aydan Murtezaoğlu (born 1961, Istanbul) is a visual artist working mainly in photography and installation. She lives and works in Istanbul.
Education.
Murtezaoğlu was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1961. She completed her secondary education at Lycée Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul. Between 1980–1984 she studied economy in Istanbul University. After her graduation, Murtezaoğlu applied to the State School of Applied Fine Arts Department of Painting and graduated in 1991. She earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in the same department.
Works.
"From "The Blackboard" to "The Pilot", from "The Room Temperature" to "Hip-Activities", my work tries to understand the meta-discourse, things that are managed in spite of other things, the language appropriating the speech in the name of others, and the interlocutor. That refers to an endeavour to understand how a world view massifies in a certain awareness, and how it remains and sticks as a meta-course. The effort in my works is focused on reflecting upon these problematics, and the issue of artistic identity before the event."Aydan Murtezaoğlu explores the socio-political movements and its effects on contemporary Turkish society. From the early 1990s until today her works deal with traumatic results of state-run modernism, and through minimal interventions she addresses themes including gender, history of past and future, cultural transitions and shifts from the social reality.
Her photographs are "overtly political and committed, which does not mean that they are not gentle and light—seemingly. The artist’s demanding attitude is subtly revealed from mise en scène to mise en scène, where she appropriates the protagonist’s place, but without toppling over into the documentary vein or autobiography... Aydan Murtezaoğlu instills a wholesome and subtle militancy through her photographs, where femininity assumes a majestic pose."
Exhibitions.
Aydan Murtezaoğlu participated in the 4th, 6th and 11th (collaborative project with Bülent Şangar) International Istanbul Biennials, the 2nd Tirana, 1st Moscow, 3rd and 5th Cetinje Biennials.

French people in Hungary

Historically, there was a significant French community residing in Hungary, who firstly came during the 11–13th century and then, once more, in a separate wave of settlement starting in the 18th century. Their descendants are today self-reported Hungarians in national censuses, with several of them having French surnames. The vast majority of today's French people living in Hungary have arrived since the Fall of the Iron Curtain.
History.
Several prominent noble families of Hungary originate from France or from Wallonia (e.g. Baron L’Huillier-Coburg, Baron Maillot de la Treille, Baron Toussainet, Baron Thierry, Baron Mandat-Grancey, Baron Deschan, Baron Montluisant, Baron Piret de Bihain, Baron Ransonnet, Earl Souches, Earl Sermage etc.).
Middle Ages.
The first French settlers came to Hungary immediately after the foundation of the Kingdom of Hungary. Among the settled foreigners, Germans were overwhelming in the majority, however, according to researches of "Mihály Auner" among others proofs that the immigration of the French element besides the German played also a significant role in the life of Hungarians. In the official documents during the rule of the Árpáds the true meaning of the often occurring words "latinus" and "olasz" meant not the Italian people, but all peoples speaking Neo Latin languages (Italian, French, Spanish etc.). (In Hungarian today the word "olasz" means Italian. At that time the word "talján" or "Lombardus" was in use for people of the Italian peninsula.) "Latini" in the Middle Ages was the common name of mainly members of the Western Congregation, while "Graeci" stood for the Eastern Church proponents. According to historians the name of Hungarian settlements containing the word "olasz" or "olaszi" could meant Walloon or French, because in German they are translated as "wallen".
The French/Walloons settled especially in Upper Hungary (in Eger, in Spiš and in Tokaj-Hegyalja) and Transylvania (in Kolozsvár, in Szatmár and in Várad-Olaszi (part of Nagyvárad)). The oldest among them was their settlement in Eger, which was already established likely in 1046. Several linguists (e.g. Géza Bárczi, János Melich and others) have assumed the Walloon-French origin of many of Hungarian place names, which can only be explained by the fact that they were founded by the French (e.g. Tállya from "taille"). According to János Melich it can be proofed with documents that between 1042 and 1048 Walloon and French settlers came to Hungary.
In Transdanubia, the town of Esztergom had a large number of French people living there. French names can be found among the members of the City Council until the 18th century. Esztergom was located along important commercial routes, and this lucky circumstance has made the town a center of commercial life in the Árpád era. Foreign merchants met here and changed their goods, many of them settled in the city. Master Roger called the French of Esztergom "Francigenae".
Fruška Gora () (today in Serbia) was also named after French settlers. The names mentioned in medieval documents "Gallus", "Gallicus", "Francus" also refer to French origin.
Beside the merchants and peasants from France and Walloonia priests, monks, missionaries and church dignitaries came to Hungary in large numbers many of whom brought their compatriots to their ecclesiastical headquarters (e.g. Leodvin, Bishop of Nagyvárad (r. c. 1050 – c. 1060) in Nagyvárad; Bonipert, Bishop of Pécs (r. 1009–1036) and Bartholomew le Gros, Bishop of Pécs (r. 1219–1251) in Pécs; Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom (r. 1226–1239) in Esztergom). The first monks of the Cistercian Monasteries of Egres, Zirc, Pásztó, Szentgotthárd and Pilis Mountains were also French. These were built during the reign of Béla III who was known to have maintained good relations with the French and invited French craftsmen to Hungary to rebuild his royal palace and the cathedral in Esztergom. In 1091, King Saint Ladislaus founded the Somogyvár Abbey in Somogyvár whose monks could only be French until 1204.
The influence of medieval French settlements is also evident in the linguistic history of the Hungarian language. In spelling for the Hungarian "cs" (/tʃ/) sound the letters "ch", for the "ny" (/ɲ/) sound the letters "nh" and for the "sz" (/s/) sound before "i" and "e" the letters "sc" came into use. Also several Hungarian words are of Walloon-French origin according to studies of "Géza Bárczy".
The medieval French settlers with time assimilated into the Hungarian, "Flandrenses" and German (mainly Zipser German and Transylvanian Saxon) population. The supposition that Walloons of Nagyvárad used the French language still in the 14th century is made probable by the fact that they had French priest, "Jean sacerdos de Olazi" in 1330. According to Miklós Oláh the Walloons of Eger spoke French in 1536.
Banat French.
During the Great Turkish War the Holy League could not liberate the whole territory of medieval Hungary from the Ottoman rule. The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) ended the war in which the two parties agreed to accept the new borders between the Habsburg Empire and the Ottoman Empire which meant that the historical region of Banat stayed under Turkish rule. This agreement stayed in force until the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718) ending the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718) in which Prince Eugene of Savoy and his army recaptured the Banat.
The Banat was in terrible condition at that time: the once densely populated area was almost completely uninhabited. Its residents died during the wars or escaped from the Ottoman oppression. The former Christian territory lost its buildings and churches, several of them were rebuilt to mosques. During the Ottoman rule huge areas of land became unproductive because it was not cultivated.
Count Claude Florimond de Mercy field marshal trusted of reviving this region. He founded new villages and invited settlers from different Christian territories (e.g. Germany, Italy, France, Spain etc.). Most of the settlers were Banat Swabians.
The first known French settled in the region was a postman named "Miklós Noël" in Lugos in 1724.
The first wave of French immigrants came from Lorraine and settled in Neu-Beschenowa in the summer of 1748. At that time the danger of an Ottoman attack was possible, so Maria Theresa order them to complete a military training to be able to fight in case of a war. French settlers can be found among the first residents of the newly established St Andreas in 1750. They all came from Lorraine one part speaking French and the other German.
French started to immigrate in larger numbers after 1763. According to "László Marjanucz" the earlier immigrants came mainly from Lorraine, Alsace, Luxembourg (Belgium) and Luxembourg, then later from regions of Metz, Besançon and Paris. Mercydorf was founded in 1735 and named after Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy. Its first residents were only Italians – 21 family in 1756. It was the only Italian dominated settlement of the Banat. During the years from 1769 to 1771 French settled in the village and they became the majority.
Between 1770 and 1771 the immigration reached its highest peak. The villages of Saint-Hubert, Charleville and Seultour were completely inhabited by French peasants from the Duchy of Lorraine. But the villages of Klein-Jetscha, Segenthau, Hatzfeld, Trübswetter, Gottlob, Ostern, Mercydorf, Charlottenburg, Rekasch, Marienfeld, Nakodorf and Weißkirchen had a significant French population. French settled also in Reschitz, Bruckenau, Jarmatha, Mastort, Heufeld, Groß-Jetscha, Tschatad, Bogarosch, Grabatz, Billed and Neu-Arad. Several settlers were referred to as Germans in official documents who had French surnames (e.g. "Moutard", "Duc", "Boivinais", "Pitance" etc.).
The treasury offered the immigrants support and greater freedom which made them interested in immigration to the Banat. They got land to cultivate, could build houses with the help of the treasury and tax exemption for years. The royal court always kept their interests in mind and made decisions in their benefit. They had the opportunity to take a loan (the so-called "Antizipation") which they had to pay back after three years.
During the beginning of the 19th century they assimilated into the Banat Swabian majority, a few into the Hungarians. Nowadays just their names show their French origin, but they do not speak French anymore. The longest existed their community in the three villages of Saint-Hubert, Charleville and Seultour where they stayed in majority for a long time. In the 1830s they still sung French chants during their worships, the evangelium was read in both German and French, and the preachings were held in German and French. But in just over a hundred years, the French language has also disappeared in these villages.
In the beginning of the 19th century several French travellers visited the villages. Charles Lemercier de Longpré, baron d'Haussez reported about them in 1835. Later Henri, Count of Chambord travelled there and he became so fond of them that he bought the land and five villages – Mastort, Heufeld, Saint-Hubert, Charleville and Seultour – for 1.3 million Forints.
Louis Hecht, a professor of the University of Nancy visited the French villages of the Banat in 1876. He already did not find anybody speaking French and several surnames were incorrectly recorded. The officers who came to the villages in most cases could not speak French so they wrote several names improperly, really often with German spelling. There were also some illiterate among the settlers who could not correct the spelling errors. Here is a list of names of some residents of Charleville: Ludwig Chapellie, Katharina Schirmon, Jean Düpolt, Ludwig Simono, Claude La Fleur, Joseph Piko, Anton Poussin, Karl Pigeot, Jean Peter, Le Cler, Hanry Cordie, Remillion Soissong, Jean Francois Quylion. With time several surnames changed as the population started to speak rather German. Some names were written in German: e.g. Picard -&gt; Pikar, Bikar; Laurent -&gt; Loran; Leblanc -&gt; Löblan, Leblang, Leblanc; Marchand -&gt; Marschang; Mougeon -&gt; Muschong; Collin -&gt; Kolleng; Aubertin -&gt; Oberting, Oberden; Guilleaume -&gt; Gilion, Giljon, Giljum; while others in Hungarian: Merle -&gt; Merlei, Martin -&gt; Martén, Houilon -&gt; Hujjón.
After the Second World War most of their communities were expelled. 7,000 of them were welcomed in France. In La Roque-sur-Pernes, France they still have a compact community.
Researches of "Lajos Baróti", "Antal Bodor", "Lénárt Bőhm", "Louis Hecht", "Jenő Szentkláray" and "Rogér Schilling" provide information of the French settlements of the Banat.
From the Banat several of them moved to other parts of Hungary. Hungarians having French surnames can be found mainly in Szeged (e.g. Chambré, Cherrier, Christophe, Dippong, Frecot, Gilde, Giljon, Giljum, Kahlesz, Leblanc, Massong, Merle, Muschong, Noel, Oberting, Piar, Pierre, Pétri, Potier, Schorsch, Stufle, Vitye, Wottreng etc.). Well-known Hungarians of Banat French descent are "Alessandro Bonnaz", Alajos Degré, "Miklós Cherrier", Jacob Muschong and Győző Leblanc.
Language.
The majority of the French population in Hungary speaks French or Hungarian as their first language.
Education.
Gustave Eiffel French School of Budapest is a French international school in Budapest.

Xdolls

Xdolls is a business housed in an apartment in Paris where customers rent time with lifelike silicone sex dolls. Registered as a gaming center, it opened in 2018 and that March survived a challenge brought by Communist members of the Council of Paris after police declared it does not violate the prohibition on brothels in France.
Xdolls was opened on February 1, 2018 by Joachim Lousquy, who previously operated a chain of vape shops. It is housed in an apartment at a secret location in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Customers book online to spend time at a rate of €89 per hour in a private room (termed a "game space") with one of four lifelike Chinese-manufactured silicone sex dolls approximately 1.45 m (4 ft 7 ins) tall, with virtual reality augmentation available at an extra charge. Lousquy says that the dolls are sprayed clean and sterilized in a separate room and that in addition to men the business attracts some couples. Similar establishments opened earlier in Barcelona (in February 2017), Vienna, and Dortmund in Europe, and in Japan. Lousquy plans to franchise the business in France and Italy.
Feminist groups have objected to the business. Lorraine Questieux of the anti-prostitution group characterized Xdolls as "a place that makes money from simulating the rape of a woman", and Pierre Laurent, general secretary of the French Communist Party, said he would raise the issue in the Senate of "sex robots", "some of which can resemble children". Communist members of the Council of Paris scheduled a discussion for the start of the new session in March 2018 on whether it should be banned under the 1946 law against brothels in France; prostitution was also outlawed by a 2012 law. Police visited Xdolls before the session and determined that it was not in violation, and the motion was defeated. Nicolas Bonnet Oulaldj, head of the council Communists, and fellow Communist member Hervé Bégué declared in a joint press conference that Xdolls constituted "the latest invention to bring brothels back into the landscape" and "the pinnacle of the dehumanisation of the relationship between women and men", saying it trivialized prostitution and human trafficking.

Susan Lipper

Susan Lipper (born 1953) is an American photographer, based in New York City. Her books include "Grapevine" (1994), for which she is best known, "Trip" (2000) and "Domesticated Land" (2018). Lipper has said that all of her work is "subjective documentary"; the critic Gerry Badger has said many describe it as "ominous".
Lipper is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her work is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and New York Public Library in New York City, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the National Portrait Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
Life and work.
Lipper received an MFA in photography from Yale University in 1983. She uses a medium format camera, a Hasselblad, sometimes with attached flash.
For about 20 years she has been visiting and photographing a tiny community in Grapevine Hollow in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, eastern United States. The photographs she made there between 1988 and 1994, in collaboration with her subjects the residents, became her first book "Grapevine". The critic Gerry Badger has written that "Community, family, and gender relationships seem to be at the core of her investigation." Lipper's collaborative approach distinguishes "Grapevine" from social documentary photography; she describes it as "subjective documentary". Izabela Radwanska Zhang wrote in the "British Journal of Photography" that it "challenges our belief in images labelled 'photojournalism', by interweaving a theatrical element. Lipper asked her models to assume characters that could essentially be them in the images; the result is a slippery, mysterious work."
"Trip," made between 1993 and 1999, paired photographs of urban landscapes and interiors with writing by Frederick Barthelme. "Domesticated Land" was made between 2012 and 2016 in the California desert.
Collections.
Lipper's work is held in the following permanent collections:

National Order of Merit (Brazil)

The National Order of Merit () is a decoration created to reward Brazilian citizens over 25 years of age who have rendered services relevant to the Brazilian nation, and foreigners who, according to the government, are worthy of this distinction.
History.
The order was created during the government of President Eurico Gaspar Dutra through Decree-Law Number 9.732 of 4 September, 1946, whose regulations were approved by Decree Number 21.854 of 26 September, 1946, and later consolidated by Decree Number 203 of 30 August, 1991. The President of Brazil is its grand master, and the necklace is always transferred to their successor.
The Council of the Order is based in the Planalto Palace and is composed of the Head of State, the President of the Permanent Commission of the Book of Merit (the Chancellor of the Order), the Ministers of State for Justice and Foreign Affairs, the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Republic, and the Chief of the Military Office of the Presidency of the Republic.
Features.
Insignia.
The insignia of the Order consists of a gold star with six beams, enamelled in white enameled with a wreath of roses, with the center of the obverse the armillary sphere, also of gold, in a blue field, and, on the reverse, the caption: "National Order of Merit".
The necklace consists of two chains alternately ornamented with armillary and pink spheres, allegorical elements of the decoration, and from it hangs the insignia. The Grand Cross consists of the insignia pendant of a strip of scarlet color with two white lists, passed by the shoulder strap, from right to left, plus a gold plaque with the same insignia and placed to the left of the chest. The insignia of the Grand Officer and Commander hang from a ribbon around the neck, and the insignia of the Grand Officer is accompanied by a silver plaque. The insignia of Officers and Knights are pending of a ribbon tied to the left side of the chest, being that the insignia of Officers has a rosette placed on the tape.
The design was inspired by the Imperial Order of the Rose, created by Jean-Baptiste Debret in 1829 at the request of Emperor D. Pedro I to celebrate his marriage with D. Amélie of Leuchtenberg. The monogram of the emperors was replaced by the armillary sphere and the color of the ribbon (rose) changed to scarlet.
Grades.
The five grades are Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer, and Knight. The number of awards to citizens are limited to the number shown (members of the Council and awards to foreigners are not included in these limits).

Ludwigsthal (Lindberg)

Ludwigsthal is a village in the municipality of Lindberg in the Lower Bavarian district of Regen.
Location.
Ludwigsthal lies on the B 11 federal highway between Zwiesel and Bayerisch Eisenstein. It also has a halt on the Bavarian Forest Railway.
History.
In 1826 master glassworker, Georg Christoph Abele from Neuhurkenthal, founded a glassworks in the Bohemian Forest and named it one year later after King Ludwig I of Bavaria. In 1830, Abele had a mansion built by the royal architect and building foreman, Lexa, to plans drawn up by Prague master builder, von Zobel. From 1828 to 1848, white, then green, mirror glass was produced at the factory. In March 1860, all the property was auctioned off due to insolvency. It was sold for 44,000 guilders to butcher, Josef Pauli, and brewer, Josef Kammermeier, both from Zwiesel.
At the end of the 19th century, the company switched to bottle glass manufacture. The glassworks, which still employed about 200 people after the Second World War, was closed in 1981. At the beginning of 2006, the empty building collapsed under masses of snow. The mansion of the glassworks owners, which was leased by the association "Pro National Park" in January 2008, and the glassmakers' houses are still standing. The firm of "Krystallglasmanufaktur Ludwigsthal" has continued the tradition of glass art in Ludwigsthal since 2001 with demonstration glassworks.
On 1 June 1876, Prince Otto arrived at the mansion house to spend several weeks in Ludwigsthal. On the advice of his doctors, he often walked in the forest, and his favorite path along the Regen to Regenhütte still bears the name "Prinzensteig" or "Prince's Trail".
The chapelry of Ludwigsthal was established in 1894; this was followed in 1912 by its elevation to a parish.
Near Ludwigsthal there is the information centre, "Haus zur Wildnis", of the Bavarian Forest National Park and an animal enclosure covering 65 hectares.
In 1950, the Ludwigsthal Dog Sports Association was founded, in 1977, Ludwigsthal Tennis Club and, in 1981, the Ludwigsthal Fishing Club. In 1989 the parish of Ludwigsthal counted 947 Catholics.
The old railway station building at Ludwigsthal station, 1.5 kilometres from the village, is now privately owned and not open to the public. One kilometre closer to the village - directly next to the National Park Visitor Centre - a new Ludwigsthal halt was established in 2003.
Sights.
The Neo-Romanesque parish church of the Sacred Heart built in 1893/94 to plans by Johann Baptist Schott. It has a unique Neo-Romanesque décor by Munich artist, Franz Xaver Hofstötter (1871–1913). An unusual feature is the rich painting of the interior rooms.
In the vicinity of Ludwigsthal is the information centre of "Haus zur Wildnis" ("House of the Wilderness") which belongs to the Bavarian Forest National Park and was built in 2006. There is also a 65-hectare animal enclosure in which a covered wooden observation tower stands.

Hollister Ridge

Hollister Ridge is a group of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean. They lie west from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and form three ridges that form a line; one of the ridges rises to a depth of and in the past formed an island. The seamounts are composed out of basaltic and other rocks and their ages range from about 2.5 million years ago to latest Pleistocene; an acoustic swarm recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1991-1992 is considered to be the manifestation of a historical eruption of the Hollister Ridge.
The origin of the Hollister Ridge is unclear, with various proposed mechanisms involving the neighbouring Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, crustal weaknesses and the Louisville hotspot.
History.
The ridge was discovered either by gravimetry from satellites or by the research ship "Eltanin" in 1965 and first named "Hollister Ridge" in a 1995 publication. Rock samples were taken at the ridge in 1996.
Geography and geomorphology.
The Hollister Ridge is an aseismic ridge in the Pacific Ocean, west of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. It consists of three separate ridges which are lined up in east-southeast to north-northwest direction, starting from the axis of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge and ending in the direction of the Louisville seamount chain. The eastern ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the central ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level, the western ridge is long and rises to a depth of below sea level. The central ridge formed an island in the past.
Geology.
The ridge rises from a seafloor whose age decreases from 7-8 to 0-1 million years ago southeastward. Three fracture zones, the Heezen, Tharp and Hollister fracture zones, extend northwestward across the seafloor northeast of the Hollister Ridge; at least the first two are considered to be part of the Eltanin fracture zone. A scarp lies south of the Hollister Ridge, and even farther south lies the Udintsev fracture zone. The Pacific-Antarctic Ridge close to the Hollister Ridge is the site of an isolated geoid anomaly which has been interpreted as a product of magmatic upwelling.
Rocks sampled from the Hollister Ridge have yielded basalts, alkali basalts, hawaiites, picrites and tholeiites as well as granites, which are most likely dropstones transported to the ridge by icebergs. The basalts range from aphyric to porphyric and contain phenocrysts of olivine and plagioclase. 
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its origin:
Eruptive history.
Argon-argon dating has yielded ages ranging from a mean age of 2.531 ± 0.036 million years ago for the western ridge over 0.487 ± 0.03 million years ago and 0.343 ± 0.008 million years ago for the eastern ridge to 91,000 ± 12,000 and 0 years ago for the central ridge. This implies that volcanism is still active at the central ridge, which is also the shallowest sector of the Hollister Ridge.
There is evidence of historical eruptions at the Hollister Ridge. Between 10 March 1991 and 12 June 1992 a strong acoustic swarm was recorded in the southern Pacific Ocean from several stations in French Polynesia and its source identified with a segment of the Hollister Ridge. Anthropogenic and biological origins were considered unlikely sources for the swarm, and it is thus interpreted to be a volcanic swarm. The acoustic swarm may have resulted from the interaction between seawater and a subaqueous lava lake; the acoustic patterns are not consistent with a simple explosive eruption.

Commercial fishing in Spain

Spain is an eminently maritime country with a long continental shelf running along the entire periphery of the Spanish coast. This narrow continental shelf is extremely rich in fish resources since the shelf is close to land.
The exploitation of these marine resources has a long tradition in Spain. Even in the Middle Ages and the Modern Age, the salted cod and anchovy, sardine, and pickled tunafish trade, etc. established links between the Galician, Cantabrian, South Atlantic or Levante ports, and the inner cities.
The territorial sea is a belt of coastal waters extending 200 nautical miles at most from the baseline of a coastal state, mark out the area of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This is the national fishing ground. Most of the Spanish fishing vessels fish in four different fishing areas of the national fishing ground: the Cantabrian-Northwest, the Gulf of Cádiz, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean Sea. It has to do with an inshore fleet, whose vessels are in censuses, allowing them to fish in certain areas of the fishing grounds with specific techniques or rigs, although there is a significant number of fishing units of artisanal nature.
The increased demand for fishery products laid bare the lack of the fishing production in the national fishing grounds, leading to the development of fisheries in international waters and far-away fishing grounds.
The Treaty of the European Union establishes that fishing is one of the Common Policies and that, therefore, the Union has exclusive jurisdiction in this matter. There is rivalry among the autonomous communities over the fishing that takes place in inland waters, as well as over shellfishing and aquaculture, and with regard to management of the fishing sector and fishery product marketing, development, and execution of the unitary framework. This framework is determined by Law 3/2001, of March 26, Law of Maritime Fishing of the State.
Fishing activity.
Among the development policies from the 1950s to the 1970s, Spain aimed to become a world power in obtaining maritime resources (Uxio Labarta, 1985 et al.). The Spanish fleet acquired large catches in some fishing grounds regarded as open, although to do this, they needed to travel far from the continental shelf and fish in other countries' territorial waters.
Fishing to this very day is still important in Spain. Until the 1980s, Spanish boats, supported by a fleet of freezer boats, went out fishing into the fishing grounds. This way, the fish could be evenly distributed among markets at reasonably low prices. This continued until other people saw how their fishing resources were being exploited without any monetary compensation, so they decided to increase their aquatic territory area to 2000 nautical miles in the Sea Convention, supported by the United Nations (Oya, 1995, Salvá, 1990).
From then on, Spain has had no choice but to negotiate with the other countries, coming to convenient agreements so that both sides can continue to fish in these aquatic areas. These negotiations with various EU (European Union) countries are still ongoing due to the EU's view that it is the European Commission's job to negotiate fish allocation quotas along with fishing boats, for those countries that use them, bringing fishing into common political debate. At the same time, the EU can rule closed seasons upon certain fishing boats, or put restrictions on catching certain species of fish that are in high demand, like when for example, in the Cantabrian Sea, anchovy fishing was banned for some time to allow for its recovery.
In any case, despite the 2000 nautical mile agreement that Spain had managed to come to with the different countries, this still resulted in the loss of fishing grounds (for example in Norway, Boston, Newfoundland etc.), the loss of some fisheries (like the cod fishing industry), large boat destruction, the birth of countless mixed companies (many Spanish fishermen work under English, Argentine, or Namibian pavilions), and travelling boat fleets which, if not able to fish in one fishing ground, can sail to another which is available.
Spanish boats fish all around the world, such as in the Atlantic Ocean (in Morocco, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea-Conakry, and Angola) as well as in the East Pacific Rise, in Arctic Oceans and more recently in the Indian Ocean (in Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Comoros, and Mauritius).
Fish consumption in Spain.
Yearly fish consumption per capita is around 40 kg (FAO, 1998). Spain is the most important country in terms of seafood consumption by its residents after Japan, Norway and Portugal, although the abundant fishing potential in the continental shelf has been reduced due to over-fishing. Aquaculture only reaches a small portion of its total production, even though it is increasing.
In order to supply the markets, the fishing industry has diversified its work area, unloading fresh fish from other seas in ports, either from foreign, international, or territorial waters which they have previously come to a fishing agreement with:
Fish, crustaceans, and mollusks in good condition are currently available from anywhere in the world.
Fishing production.
In 1980, fishing production in Spain amounted to 1.15 million tonnes, broken down into 75% fish, 20% molluscs and 5% other species (Map, 1981). In 2013, production amounted to a million tonnes, with a first-sale price of 2.165 billion euros.
Regarding the different fished species, the Atlantic horse mackerel, mackerel, sardine, anchovy, and tuna in its different varieties, as well as hake, four-spot megrim, angler fish and pollock are the most important. Mussels farmed from hanging ropes on rafts make up the majority of mollusc production. The commercialisation of seafood species, such as clams, wedge clams, cockles, etc., which are gathered from the coast, takes place mainly in Galicia. Almost all current mussel rafts are located there. Langoustine and prawn fishing in community waters from the eastern and Andalusian coast of Spain, as well as the fishing ground in North Africa, stand out when it comes to crustacean fishing.
The main ports for unloading the catches are the Galician ones in Vigo and in La Coruña, followed by the ones in the Bay of Cádiz, Pasaia, Avilés, Santander and Gijón.
You can find more information on the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment's website.
The processing industry alone produced 850,912 tonnes of processed product worth more than 3.884 billion euros that same year in 2013.
This data complements the foreign trade's information, with imports of 1,477,707 tonnes (4.814 billion euros) and exports of 959,542 tonnes (2.908 billion euros) in 2013, where the community market (EU) represents about one fifth of the commercial transactions.
Marine reserves in Spain.
Marine reserves are specific measures that contribute to a sustainable exploitation of the fishing interest's resources, establishing specific protection measures in demarcated areas of the traditional fishing grounds. These areas that are selected taking into account their conservation status, must have certain characteristics that allow an improvement in the reproduction conditions in the interest of the fishes species, and the survival of younger specimens.
Where marine reserves have been placed, the effect has been a significant recovery of fishing grounds as a result of the dispersion of the species whose reproduction has been protected there.
The following marine reserves are in Spain:
From the above-mentioned ones, only 5 are under the control of the State: (Masía Blanca, Columbretes Islands, Cabo de Gata-Níjar, Alboran Island and La Palma) and 4 are under shared management (Tabarca, Cape Palos-Islas Hormigas, Graciosa Island and Punta de la Restinga-Mar de Las Calmas). Os Miñarzos and Ría de Cedeira are the autonomous community of Galicia's responsibility.

Sonia Guiñansaca (born in Cuenca, Ecuador in 1989) is a migrant poet, cultural organizer and activist whose work aims for culture equality and social justice, focusing on migrant rights, climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, and gender discrimination.
Background.
Guiñansaca migrated from Ecuador to Harlem at the age of five to reunite with her parents, who were undocumented. After graduation (Hunter College with a BA in Africana Puerto Rican Latino Studies and Women and Gender Studies) with her background in organizing migrant undocumented communities, she determined that not only policy but art and culture play crucial roles to bring social changes. Since 2013 she worked at Culture Strike as the managing director, an American organization with more than 200 artists of multiple disciplines working for a social change acknowledging and supporting queer, transgender, women, color, migrant emergent artists. In particular, she created the first writing workshops by and for undocumented writers, then co-created the first and only national writing retreat for undocumented writers called UndocuWriters Retreat. In Spring 2013 created and helped launch Undocumenting.tmblr.com, a project highlighting the work of undocumented immigrants. Guiñansaca has performed in many different places such as Museo del Barrio, Nuyorican Poets Café, NY Poetry Festival, The Met, Brooklyn Museum, London, Mexico, and featured in Latina Magazine, PBS, Poetry Foundation, etc. She also presented Keynotes, workshops and panels in different Universities. In October 2017 she self-published her debut chapbook "Nostalgia &amp; Borders" and is editing the first undocumented poetry anthology "Home in Time of Displacement" and currently working on a new chapbook "#PapiFemme," which will focus on the central themes of gender and presentation, as well as the queer and immigrant communities. She was named by "Teen Vogue" as one of the "13 Coolest Queers on the Internet."

Union of Cypriots

The Union of Cypriots (; ) is a Cypriot nationalist, progressive political organization in Cyprus. The Union of Cypriots campaigns for a unitary Cypriot state, the restoration of the constitutional order that was destroyed in Cyprus after the crisis of 1963-64, and the ending of the Turkish occupation of Cyprus.
History and overview.
The Union of Cypriots' origins root back to different organisations including the World Union of Turkish-speaking Cypriots, and the youth organisation LINOBAMBAKI, which was one of the formations that led the 2011 Turkish Cypriot protests. The organization supports a unitary solution instead of a federal one, concerning the reunification of Cyprus. With the idea of Cyprus belonging to all Cypriots, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, the organisation supports turning back to 1960 constitution, and reinforcing it more in the line of "one nation, one flag, one homeland and one state" view.
The organization supported Cypriots who were targeted in the occupied areas of Cyprus, in events such as the prosecution of some community members for hanging the flag of the Republic of Cyprus in 2013, the attacks against the Afrika newspaper by Turkish settlers in 2018, the court cases that were filed against journalists by Turkey in 2019, and the actions against the workers who wanted to cross barricades to enter the free areas in 2020.
In 2019, the Union of Cypriots announced to public its interest in participating in the European Parliament elections independently, but later it was represented by Oz Karahan on the ticket of Jasmine Movement.
The Union of Cypriots is a member of international organisations such as the "International League of Peoples' Struggle", the "International Coordination of Revolutionary Parties and Organizations", the "Global Ecosocialist Network", and the "No to war - No to NATO".
Honorary Awards.
The Union of Cypriots presents Honorary Awards in memory of Dr. İhsan Ali, a Cypriot community leader and a statesman.

Carol Ann Carter

Carol Ann Carter is an American artist best known for her mixed media and fiber construction works. Her works can be found in public collections such as the Indianapolis Museum of Art. She is currently a Professor Emeritus of visual arts at the University of Kansas.
Background.
Carol Ann Carter earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Herron School of Art at the Indiana University in 1970. After completing her Bachelor's she was taken on as artist-in-residence at her alma mater, Shortridge High School in Indianapolis. The program was funded by the PTA Fine Arts Committee and the Indiana State Arts Commission and was meant to inspire artistic expression and confidence in students who were not already interested in the arts. Carter then completed her Masters of Fine Arts from the University of Notre Dame in 1974.
Art influence and style.
In her early years, Carter was focused on intaglio printmaking and then transitioned into textile work in 1984 after she traveled to Nigeria on a Lilly Endowment to study traditional men's embroidery and weaving. This trip solidified her interest in examining culture and gender through textile work. Carter's recent works are multimedia, digital and video based.

Joseph Marie Piétri

Émile Joseph Marie Piétri (25 February 1820 – 4 January 1902), known as Joachim Pietri, was a French lawyer and public servant who was prefect of several departments, a repressive police chief of Paris in the last years of the Second French Empire and Bonapartist Senator of Corsica from 1879 to 1885.
Early years.
Joseph Marie Piétri was born in Sartène, Corsica, on 25 February 1820.
His parents were Angelo Francesco Pietri (1784–1848) and Giulia Pietri (1786–1853).
His family was not wealthy.
His brother was Pierre-Marie Piétri(), who later became prefect of the police of Paris from January 1852 to January 1858.
Piétri studied law in Paris, then practiced as an advocate in Sartène.
By ordinance of 31 August 1838 he was appointed justice of the peace in the Corsican canton of Rogliano.
He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution of 1848.
On 9 August 1848 thanks to the support of his brother he was appointed sub-prefect of Argentan.
He then became a supporter of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte.
On 29 April 1850 Piétri married Palma de Rocca Serra (1830–1885) in Sartène.
They had several children including Marinette (c. 1843–1941), Pomponne (1855–1880) and Louis (born 1872).
Piétri was appointed sub-prefect of Brest on 9 May 1852.
He became Prefect of Ariège on 3 April 1853.
He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 3 January 1855 for his dedication during an outbreak of cholera.
He became Prefect of Cher on 6 November 1855, Prefect of Hérault on 5 January 1861 and of Prefect of Nord on 12 November 1865.
He became known for his administrative qualities and support of the Bonapartist regime.
Prefect of Police.
On 21 February 1866 Piétri was appointed Prefect of Police of Paris in place of Symphorien Boittelle.
He was aged 46.
By decree of 19 December 1866 he was made a member of the Imperial Commission of the Exposition Universelle of 1867.
On 13 August 1867 he was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.
Piétri was energetic in repressing unrest.
On 2 November 1867 he surrounded Montmartre Cemetery in Paris where 1,500 Republicans had gathered at the grave of the deputy Jean-Baptiste Baudin, who had been killed on a barricade on 4 December 1851 after the coup d'état of 2 December 1851 that brought Napoleon III to power.
He also suppressed the demonstration in honour of Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who had defended Ernest Renan in the senate.
Piétri did not moderate the violence of his agents, and in December 1867 sent a circular to the police commissioners "to guard against any hesitation or failure."
At the same time, he declared that "individual liberty has never been, under any regime, better guaranteed or better respected."
During the general elections of 1869 Piétri took a tough line with men who were hostile to the regime, and in a report to Napoleon on 28 November 1869 attacked powerful men such as Rouher and Persigny.
After discovery of the plot that was judged at Blois in 1870 he encouraged the demonstrations on the boulevards of Paris in favour of war with Prussia.
A decree of 27 July 1870, which was not published, made him a senator.
After the defeat of France at the Battle of Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War he left France hastily on 4 September 1870 and joined Napoleon III in exile.
Later career.
In 1872 Piétri applied to the government of Adolphe Thiers for a retirement pension.
Although he did not qualify on age or years of service, a decree in April 1873 fixed his pension arrears at 6,000 francs.
Léon Renault, the prefect of police, reported in January 1875 that Piétri was one of the most active members of the Bonapartist committee.
He became a general councilor of Corsica.
On 22 June 1879 Piétri was elected Senator of Corsica on an imperialist platform by 256 votes against 227 for his opponent, Tomasi.
He sat on the right with the Appel au peuple group.
He voted against the application of laws to religious congregations, against changes to the judicial oath, against reform of the magistrature and against restoration of divorce.
He left office on 24 January 1885.
In the general election of 25 January 1885 he failed to be reelected, winning only 212 out of 744 votes.
He was defeated by Paul de Casabianca, who won 477 votes.
Piétri retired from politics after this.
He died on 4 January 1902 in Sartène at the age of 82.

Susan Cervantes

Susan Kelk Cervantes (née Susan Elizabeth Kelk; born 1944) is an American artist who has been at the epicenter of the San Francisco mural movement and the co-founder and executive director of the community-based non-profit, Precita Eyes Muralists.
Personal life and education.
Susan Elizabeth Kelk graduated high school a year early in Dallas, Texas to attend art school at the age of 16. Since her parents could not help pay her tuition after losing their floral and nursery business Kelk accepted a scholarship from the Dallas Museum of Art and attended the San Francisco School of Fine Arts, (now known as the San Francisco Art Institute or SFAI). Kelk received her B.F.A. in 1965 and M.F.A. in 1968 from SFAI. 
In her first year of college in the 1960s, Kelk met her husband and collaborator, Luis Cervantes (1924–2005). They had three sons together.
Career.
Susan Cervantes is considered a leader in the Mission District community mural movement and considers herself a community artist responsible for over 400 murals. Cervantes was introduced to murals through Diego Rivera's "The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City" (1931) at Diego Rivera Gallery and was inspired by and then joined the Mujeres Muralistas in the early 1970s. She was asked to help paint with the Mujeres Muralistas at Paco's Tacos, a restaurant on the corner of 24th and South Van Ness, which marks the moment she lost interest in her studio work on canvas. Though Cervantes was not Chicana her work was strongly influenced by and sensitive to the Chicano art movement.
Later, Susan began volunteering as an art teacher at the Precita Valley Community Center where her Thursday night painting workshop quickly became a mural workshop. The class did not have a wall to teach on, so they painted on five plywood panels, totaling 20 feet when assembled. That mural, named "Masks of God, Soul of Man" was the first and only mural Susan created that didn't have a wall waiting for it, meaning that "Walls come to [her]" and that her work is all currently by request. It was displayed in the Bernal Heights Library and was debuted as the work of the Precita Eyes Muralists. Susan and Luis founded the Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center in 1977. Precita Eyes has been recognized for creating public art that reflects its community's history and culture. One of only three community mural centers in the United States, Precita Eyes sponsors and implements ongoing mural projects throughout the Bay Area and internationally. Some of her notable work has appeared at the "MaestraPeace" mural on the Women's Building, Clarion Alley Mural Project, , Balmy Alley and on the Northeastern University Latinx Student Cultural Center.
Precita Eyes has participated in many of the murals that are in San Francisco's historic Mission District neighborhood, known for the murals that cover the walls of many buildings in the neighborhood. They collaborate with schools in the community, as well as other youth programs, to allow youth artists to plan and execute their own mural design at their school or local building. Precita Eyes partners with mural artists to teach technique and creative thinking to the students that they work with, making sure that they have guidance but the freedom to create a mural that is meaningful to them and their community. Also among their slew of programs is a toddler art class, support for young student artists through exhibitions of their work, and providing educational tours of the murals in the neighborhood.

SS Osterley

SS "Osterley" was a steam ocean liner owned by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. She was built by the London and Glasgow Shipbuilding Company at Clydebank, Scotland in 1909 for a passenger service between London and Australia via the Suez Canal.
Maiden voyage: 1909. Requisitioned as a troop ship in 1915. She was scrapped in Glasgow in 1930.
Launch.
Initial attempts to launch the ship were inauspicious. It was reported that: "The Osterley, 12,000 tons, a new steamer built for the Orient Steam Navigation Company, was to have been launched at Govan, Glasgow, yesterday (21 January 1909). The vessel was released on the slip by the Countess of Jersey, but owing to frost affecting the grease the Osterley stopped 40 feet down the ways. Thereupon the vessel was fastened, and the launching was postponed." A second attempt was successful: "The steamer Osterley was successfully lowered into the water this morning (26 January 1909).
Orient Line registered "Osterley" at Glasgow. Her UK official number was 128287 and her code letters were HPGN.
Five sister ships were built for this route: , , "Osterley", , "Orvieto". They were joined in 1911 by , which was slightly larger and had different machinery.
Description.
At the time of launching, and before she was fitted out, it was reported: "The Osterley, named after the country seat of Lord Jersey, is the third of the five 12,000 ton steamers ordered by the Orient Steam Navigation Company, Limited, to meet the requirements of the mail contract entered into with the Commonwealth Government. The Osterley has been built by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company, Limited, and is timed to leave London on her maiden voyage to Sydney on August 6. The length of this great liner is 650ft, and she has a beam of 62ft. Seven decks are to be built — boat, promenade, shelter, upper, main lower and orlop — and accommodation is to be provided for an exceptionally large number of passengers in three classes. The features of the Osterley will be a divan smoking lounge, or winter garden, for the use of both sexes; a well-equipped library, an electric elevator to run from the main to the promenade decks; wireless telegraphic apparatus, which will be used as soon as land stations have been established on the Australian coast, a nursery for the children, and an up-to-date laundry. The insulated holds will provide for about 2500 tons of perishable produce and the Osterley will develop a speed of 19 knots. The engines will be balanced on a system which will prevent vibration. Mr. Kenneth Anderson, chairman of the Orient S.N. Company, Limited, who arrived at Sydney yesterday from London, states that excellent progress is being made with the construction of the whole of the new steamers." Further details were provided subsequent to the launch: "A great improvement has been made in the accommodation for third-class passengers. These will be provided with a spacious dining saloon, music-room, and smoking-room; their sleeping accommodation will be mostly on the upper and main decks, and their promenade deck for exercise and amusement is unusually extensive. The first class saloons, lounges, social halls, and cabins will be palatial, and the second saloon passengers will have accommodation no less roomy and comfortable, even though it is less highly embellished. A feature of the second class is the fact of the accommodation being entirely amidships."
Maiden voyage.
The Osterley's maiden voyage was not everything the owners would have desired. On arrival at Fremantle 10 September 1909, a summary report of the voyage to date was provided: "Running over 30 hours behind time, the R.M.S. Osterley, the third of the new Orient liners, arrived on her maiden visit to Fremantle yesterday afternoon. The Osterley, which is built on similar lines to the Otway and Orsova, which have already visited Fremantle, is having a somewhat remarkable first voyage. Between London and Plymouth trouble with the cylinders necessitated a longer stay than usual at Plymouth. The time lost at Plymouth was, however, made up before Marseilles was reached, and a good run to Naples landed the Osterley at the Italian port well ahead of the mails. Entering Port Said the bottom of the first intermediate cylinder of the port engine was blown out. Being a quadruple-engined steamer, it was decided at Port Said to cut out and work the Osterley as a triple-expansion-engined vessel. The delay at Port Said was caused by this work. It is just possible that this time might have been made up between Suez and Colombo if no other mishap had occurred, but, leaving Suez on August 21, still working triple-expansion on the port engine, the Osterley had not been long in the Gulf of Suez before the engineers had trouble with an over-heated high-pressure piston rod. It had to be taken out, and the spare rod in the disabled cylinder fitted in its place. This was rather arduous work in the Red Sea, but the two squads of seven engineers, each working shifts of six hours, had the work done in 30 hours. When she left Suez the Osterley was steaming 15 knots, but, during the repairs in the Red Sea her speed was reduced to 10 knots, meaning that in the 30 hours required she lost 150 miles. The Osterley worked with the starboard engines from the time the piston bent, and did 15 knots regularly after the repairs had been effected. The bent piston was landed at Colombo to be straightened. The Osterley, like her sister ships, will be fitted with wireless telegraphy, but the Orient Company are waiting until the land stations have been erected before installing the system on their vessels. She is in charge of Capt. Jenks, late of the R.M.S. Oroya."
Wireless.
By 1913 "Osterley" was equipped for wireless telegraphy, operating on the 300 and 600 metre wavelengths. Her call sign was MOY.
Fate.
After her final sailing as a troop ship in 1919, "Osterley" returned to the Australia service. She was scrapped in Glasgow in 1930.

Dhirari

The Dhirari (or Dirari or Tirari) were an indigenous Australian people of the state of South Australia. They are not to be confused with the Diyari people, though the Dirari/Dhirari language (now extinct) was a dialect of the Diyari language.
Name.
Some confusion arose when, in 1904, the ethnographer A. W. Howitt confused this distinct, if small, tribe with their neighbours, the Diyari, suggesting it was a name for a horde of the latter. The German missionary testified in 1936 that the Tirari's speech differed from Diyari language.
Country.
Norman Tindale estimated their tribal lands as covering roughly . They dwelt around the eastern shore of Lake Eyre, running northwards from Muloorina to the Warburton River. Their eastern frontiers were at Killalapaninna.
History of contact.
The Tirari were extinct by the time of Tindale's writing (1974). Their name is memorialized in the toponym denoting part of the land they occupied, Tirari Desert.

The Fullarton

The Fullarton is a performing arts theatre and entertainment venue in the town of Castle Douglas in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.
Before the acquisition and opening of The Fullarton (then Lochside Theatre) in 1990, Castle Douglas had previously only one theatre called the Little Theatre, in an old army hut run by the Unity Players. It was closed in the 1970s due to a failure in requirements to run safely as a theatre. In 1984, the late Donald Fullarton, (whose daughter Morag Fullarton is a theatre and television director ), a member of the Scottish Community Drama Association subsequently formed the Galloway Arts Project with the help of local amateur dramatics clubs. 
The former St Andrew's Church became available in the 1990s, and was subsequently purchased by the project and funding was provided by both the Stewartry District Council and the Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council. In the mid 1990s, further major funds were provided by the newly founded National Lottery and opened as a functioning theatre in 1996.
The theatre was refurbished in 2013 in order to meet changing requirements for performance spaces, and was changed from the Lochside Theatre to The Fullarton Theatre in tribute to Donald Fullarton. 
Currently, it holds performances, conferences and also is used as a local cinema. It is also used by the member clubs of the Scottish Community Drama Association, most recently holding the SCDA One-Act Western Divisional Festival in March 2018.

Yungen

Clive James Brooks (born 1 February 1992), also known as Yungen, is a British rapper, singer and songwriter from Herne Hill, South London. Yungen gained initial recognition for his 2011 F64 freestyle video for SB.TV, and by 2015 had been nominated for Best Newcomer at the MOBO Awards. As a grime artist, Yungen takes inspiration from numerous music genres, which varies from rap to R&amp;B and his own experimentations. Yungen's most successful song is "Bestie", which features Yxng Bane, and this song reached top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in October 2017 and also became his first platinum single in February 2018.
Early life.
Clive James Brooks was born on 1 February 1992 and was raised in Herne Hill Estate. Although his lyrics expose the darker side of his childhood, he often expresses gratitude in regards to his upbringing. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Yungen stated that, "Growing up on an estate was everything to me." Brooks’ friends on the estate nicknamed him ‘Yungen’, which later gave him the inspiration for his stage name. From the age of 13 Brooks was inspired by an older cousin to try MC’ing, but his shyness prevented him from seeing it as a potential career. Growing up, Brooks listened to a diverse range of genres, enabling him to draw on a variety of influences in his songs. Combining his older sisters influence of RnB and artists such as Jagged Edge, with his father's background as Hip hop DJ, meant there was a diverse range of music genres inside his house. In 2008, at the age of 16, the death of his friend caused Brooks to change his behaviours and become more mature and responsible, thus, he decided to pursue music as a career. Artists such Wretch 32 and Giggs also inspired Yungen to pursue a music career as he could relate to and connect with these artists. Yungen is also an avid supporter of Liverpool F.C.
Career.
2009–2014.
In 2010, Yungen released his first video on YouTube named 'Hometown'. However, due to its popularity, the video was taken down by the organization. In 2011, the video was re-uploaded on Yungen's original Youtube channel named Yungen TV. The video received interest from SB.TV, founder Jamal Edwards, which led to Yungen's F64 Freestyle video on the channel in 2011. Yungen has since stated that his shyness as a child prevented him from showcasing his music sooner; before making his first music video he had previously avoided all cameras.
Yungen joined Play Dirty in 2012, and released his mixtape "Topic of Discussion" in April 2013. He then went on to support Naughty Boy throughout his 2014 worldwide tour, performing across Europe, as well as in the UAE and Australia.&lt;ref name= "TheLinkUp Yungen/NaughtyBoy"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Yungen established his clothing line, Forever Yung. He later independently launched a two part project named ‘Project Black and Red’ in 2014, which featured artists Stormzy, Wretch 32, and Krept and Konan.
Yungen promoted the project with a sold-out gig at the O2 Academy Islington in November 2014, which included guest appearances from many of the artists featured in the album. He released "Don't Take It Personal" on his SoundCloud that same year, a song that explored the darker aspects of his upbringing, including the death of his friend in 2008.
In August 2014, Yungen released "Ain't on Nuttin" with rapper Sneakbo. The two remixes (Part 1 and Part 2) featured rappers such as Section Boyz, Bashy, Stormzy and Ghetts.
2015–present.
After the release of "Project Black and Red", Yungen was nominated for the 2015 MOBO Best Newcomer Award and signed his first record contract with Sony RCA that November. BBC Radio 1Xtra named Yungen as one of the hottest new artists to watch for 2016, and in February 2016 Yungen released his single "Comfy". In April 2016 Yungen released his next single "Off the Record 2" and performed a sold-out show at Village Underground. This was shortly followed by the release of R&amp;B-inspired "Take My Number" featuring Angel on 10 May 2016. "Take My Number" was followed by "Do It Right", a collaboration with Sneakbo featuring Haile, on 6 December. Independently from Sony, Yungen released the single "You Don't Know Me Like That" through Forever Yung on 5 February 2016, and "Cuffing Season" under House of Forever on 24 November 2016.
In 2016, Yungen also gained greater publicity over a verbal disagreement with the rapper Chip (formerly known as Chipmunk). The argument began when Chip commented on Yungen's MOBO Award nomination, which escalated when each artist wrote and released tracks about the other. When the dispute was resolved, this exposure ultimately helped Yungen improve his rapping credibility and reach a wider audience. Yungen became the face of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star x Nike Flyknit in 2017, headlining the launch event at the Victoria House, London in April. Also in April, Yungen performed another sold out show, this time at KOKO with Yxng Bane as the support artist. Yungen's first single of 2017, "Bestie" featuring Yxng Bane, was released in June and climbed the UK Charts, reaching the top 10 in October and achieving first Gold status in November 2017 and then Platinum in February 2018. The song's music video was filmed spontaneously in Dubai where the rapper was on a holiday, and during this trip, Yungen asked Yxng Bane to fly out and film it. Later that year, in May, Yungen independently released "Fools Gold" through House of Forever, which was inspired by his dismay that people were living their lives for Instagram.
Yungen performed at a number of festivals in the summer of 2017, including his headline set on the second stage at Wireless Festival on Saturday 8 July, where Skepta performed on the main stage immediately after. Yungen then went on to play Jamaica House at the Indigo at the O2 on 10 August, and V Festival on 20 August. In September 2017, Yungen announced that his The Chosen Tour would commence on 16 November 2017 in Glasgow and end on 1 December at the Dublin Academy. He followed the announcement with two giveaway tracks—"Chosen" on Friday 13 October and "All Night" featuring Mr Eazi on Friday 27 October. Tickets for the Chosen Tour, including those for Shepherd's Bush Empire, sold out. In November 2017, Yungen featured on Steel Banglez's, "Bad", alongside MoStack, Mr. Eazi and Not3s, and this song reached number 30 on the UK Singles Chart.
In 2018, Yungen teamed up with Clean Bandit and Julia Michaels to release a remix of "I Miss You" on 5 January.

Howarth–Dorodnitsyn transformation

In fluid dynamics, Howarth–Dorodnitsyn transformation (or Dorodnitsyn-Howarth transformation) is a density-weighted coordinate transformation, which reduces compressible flow conservation equations to simpler form (in most cases, to incompressible form). The transformation was first used by Anatoly Dorodnitsyn in 1942 and later by Leslie Howarth in 1948. The transformation of formula_1 coordinate to formula_2 is given by
where formula_4 is the density and formula_5 is the density at infinity. The transformation is extensively used in boundary layer theory and other gas dynamics problems.

Bavarian Forest Museum Village

The Bavarian Forest Museum Village () is an open air museum near Tittling on the southwestern shore of the Dreiburgensee lake in the Bavarian Forest. It covers about 25 hectares and has over 150 buildings from the period from 1580 to 1850 and a local history collection with 60,000 items. It is thus one of the largest open air museums in Europe.
The museum was founded in 1974 by Georg Höltl with the restoration of the 500-year-old Rothau Mill ("Rothaumühle"). This building which, following the collapse of its roof timbers in 1972, had been sold by Georg and Centa Höltl, still stands on its original site below the Dreiburgensee. Since then, numerous buildings from across the Bavarian Forest have been transported to the museum. Among the types of building on show are farmhouses, day labourers' houses, chapels, the oldest village school in Germany, workshops and mills. The comprehensive local history collection includes holy articles, farm furniture and household effects, clothing, agricultural tools, jewellery, glass products and carts. Several times a year, a large farmer's market takes place in the museum village, where there are many stalls and demonstrations of old customs and handicrafts.

Rita Nagel, known professionally as Mary Ann Nagel, is a German singer. Nagel is notable for being the founding member of the Arabesque girl group in 1977.
Life and career.
Mary Ann Nagel was born as Rita Nagel in 1955. She took on the pseudonym of "Mary Ann" and began to sing from a very young age. She first released children's songs: So Viele Fragen / Laß mich nicht so lang allein" in 1968 and "Pony Girl / Du Ich Lieb' Dich Candy Man" in 1972. This was followed by schlager single "Schau Mich Nicht So Böse An / Ein Tag So Schön Wie Heut" in 1973. The singles did not have much success. Inspired by the recent success of the Silver Convention and other girl groups, Nagel and producers sought to create another girl group. Arabesque was formed in 1977, and "Hello Mr. Monkey" was released as the first single featuring lead vocals by Nagel. Her participation in the group was short-lived however, she only recorded two songs with the group: disco songs "Hello Mr. Monkey / Buggy Boy". Nagel's family life became more important than her career as a singer. She was married, had a son, and disliked the long driving from her hometown of Karlsruhe, Germany to Offenbach am Main, where the group was based. Mary Ann was part of Arabesque for a little over a year; she left in September 1978 and was replaced by Heike Rimbeau.

Hashgraph

Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that has been described as an alternative to blockchains. The hashgraph technology is currently patented, and the only authorized ledger is Hedera Hashgraph. The native cryptocurrency of the Hedera Hashgraph system is HBAR. 
Unlike blockchains, hashgraphs do not use miners to validate transactions. Instead, hashgraphs use a "gossip about gossip" protocol where the individual nodes on the network "gossip" about transactions to create directed acyclic graphs that time-sequence transactions without bundling them into blocks. Each "gossip" message contains one or more transactions plus a timestamp, a digital signature, and cryptographic hashes of two earlier events. This makes Hashgraph form an asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (aBFT) consensus algorithm. 
Hashgraph was invented in the mid-2010s by the American computer scientist Leemon Baird. Baird is the co-founder and chief technical officer of Swirlds, a company that holds patents covering the hashgraph algorithm.

Hashgraph has been described as a continuation or successor to the blockchain concept, which provides increased speed, fairness, low cost, and security constraints. The Hedera white paper co-authored by Baird explained that "at the end of each round, each node calculates the shared state after processing all transactions that were received in that round and before," and it "digitally signs a hash of that shared state, puts it in a transaction, and gossips it out to the community."
Hedera Hashgraph.
Hedera Hashgraph is the only public distributed ledger based on the Hashgraph algorithm. Hedera Hashgraph is developed by a company of the same name, Hedera, based in Dallas, Texas. Hedera was founded by Hashgraph inventor Leemon Baird and his business partner Mance Harmon, and has an exclusive license to the Hashgraph patents held by their company, Swirlds. 
Hedera is owned and managed by a "governing council" of global companies and entities that have invested in it. The council's members include Swirlds, as well as Google, Boeing, IBM, Deutsche Telekom, LG, Tata Communications, Électricité de France, FIS, University College London, the London School of Economics, DLA Piper, Shinhan Bank, Standard Bank, and several others.
Criticism.
It has been claimed that hashgraphs are less technically constrained than blockchains proper. Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer notes that “The correctness of the entire Hashgraph protocol seems to hinge on every participant knowing and agreeing upon "N", the total number of participants in the system,” which is "a difficult number to determine in an open distributed system.” Baird responded that “All of the nodes at a given time know how many nodes there are.” A hashgraph developer at the time noted that "...a node joining the network is a transaction like any other - it gets assigned a consensus timestamp, after which point all nodes now include it in consensus."

Amelia Tilghman

Amelia Louise Tilghman (surname also spelled Tiligman; 6 September 1856 District of Columbia – 12 December 1931 District of Columbia) (pronounced "TILL man") was a pianist, teacher, and activist who, among other things, founded the first African-American journal devoted to music, "The Musical Messenger," published from 1886 to 1891.
Biography and work.
Amelia Tilghman, the daughter of Margaret Ann Reynolds (maiden; 1819–1903) and Henry Hyland Tilgman (1811–1900), grew up in a free black middle-class family in Washington, District of Columbia, Her voice was so remarkable that the bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church apparently once declared, “the child's parents had better spend a hundred dollars on her voice not than leave her a fortune when they die.” Instead, she enrolled in the Normal School of Howard University, graduated in 1870, and accepted a full-time job as a teacher in the black Georgetown public schools in 1870.
After fourteen years, she relocated to Boston where she studied music pedagogy with Samuel Jamieson (1855–1930) at the Boston Conservatory of Music, though she never graduated with a degree.
In addition to her work as a teacher, Tilghman pursued a career as a pianist. She performed at Steinway Hall in Manhattan, New York, in 1880 and was described by a reviewer as "a musical star of the first magnitude." The following year, she was the invited soloist at "Saengerfest", a festival at the Grand Opera House in Louisville, Kentucky. There, she heard a choral work of William Batchelder Bradbury, "Esther, the Beautiful Queen" and was so enamored that she decided to organize, direct, and star in a production of the piece in Washington, D.C. The performance, at Thanksgiving, 1881, was hailed as “a grand success,” for it proved that “there is talent which needs but to be intelligently and thoroughly trained to produce really artistic performances.”
In early 1886, for reasons unknown, Tilghman relocated to Montgomery, Alabama, where she took a job in the public schools. When she arrived, reflected a journalist, looking back from 1893, “there were no colored pianists in Montgomery, and in no house where colored people lived did one hear in passing the artistic rendition of music as is now heard in almost every two or three squares.” During her first year in town, Amelia organized a recital of her students in a local Congregational Church.
"The Musical Messenger".
In Montgomery, Tilghman founded the first African-American music journal, a monthly publication called "The" "Musical Messenger." This entrée into journalism was not easy for her, as men dominated the field at the time and for years after women reported facing prejudice. The journal's tagline was “the highest moral, social and intellectual interest of the people.” The two surviving issues of the publication—both from 1889—focus on educating its readers about music history (such as the biography of Hayden), church choir repertoire, and sharing and circulating the names and work of African-American composers. “That the race stands sadly in need of such a journal should be freely admitted. It is our earnest hope that the educator's hands may be strengthened and her soul fortified in this very creditable venture,” wrote the "Philadelphia Tribune".
Tilghman returned permanently to Washington, D.C., to assist with the care of her seriously ill mother in 1888. There, she hired the musician and teacher Lucinda B. Bragg Adams (1870-1932) as an associate editor for "The Musical Messenger". While roundly celebrated, the publication was not profitable.
Later life.
Tilghman discontinued the publication and refocused her energies on teaching after 1891. She died in 1931.

Chinese siege weapons

This is an overview of Chinese siege weapons.
Siege ladders.
Siege ladders were used starting from the Warring States period. A hinged folding ladder known as the "cloud ladder" was quite prominent. Originally it used a counterweight to unfold once within reach of the enemy walls, but the contraption proved to be too vulnerable, and switched to a simple pulling mechanism during the Song dynasty. The newer version had men pull on ropes from behind with the aid of a long pole to move the top ladder into position. Some ladders had a compartment built below it to house soldiers who provided covering fire with crossbows.
Hook carts.
Hook carts such as the fork and falcon carts were used to pull down parapets and the top part of walls to make it easier for ladders to access. Once attached, 50 to 100 men took hold of a rope and pulled until the wall came down. They were used as early as the Three Kingdoms period, as mentioned by Chen Lin:
Assault cover.
Various protective covers were used during a siege. The most typical were mobile screens and assault wagons. More complex contraptions such as plaited galleries were used for mining and filling in moats.
Observation tower.
Static observation towers such as the nest and watchtower carts were used to see into the city. Static towers were also be used in close proximity to enemy walls to rain down projectiles on the defenders.
Mobile siege tower.
Mobile siege towers have been used in China since the 6th century BC. They were often called overlook carts, assault carts, or some combination of the two. A typical mobile siege tower was five stories tall mounted on axles with two wheels on each side. The tower was pushed forward by men on the lowest storey or pulled by horses and oxen.
The king of Wu mentioned it in a passage comparing land armies to the navy. 
During the Tang dynasty, in the 783 siege of Fengtian, an assault cart 10 meters tall was constructed, protected by layers of cowhide and equipped with leather bags of water to douse fires. It was used in an attempt to breach the city. The defenders managed to dig a trench in front of the siege engine, which tipped it over, and they burnt it and had it destroyed.
In 1132 the Jurchen Jin dynasty constructed assault carts called "sky bridges" during the Siege of De'an, but failed to reach the enemy walls due to the use of long beams to push them away.
The last recorded use of assault carts was in 1851 by the Taiping rebels to besiege Guilin after their first attempt with ladders failed. They mounted cannons on it to bombard the Qing soldiers manning the walls, but the tower was destroyed by a combination of burning oil and long poles wrapped in incendiary material at the ends.
Ram.
The Chinese ram used an iron-plated head. After the introduction of gunpowder it added a cannon as well.
Traction trebuchet.
The traction trebuchet, also referred to as a mangonel in some sources, is an artillery weapon which derives from manpower its motive force, and was probably used by the Mohists starting from the 4th century BC. Descriptions of it can be found in the "Mojing" (compiled in the 4th century BC). It consisted of an arm and sling mounted on a wooden frame, sometimes with wheels. Attached to one end of the arm were pulling ropes for men to power the weapon. In Chapter 14 of the "Mojing", the traction trebuchet is described hurling hollowed out logs filled with burning charcoal at enemy troops. Trebuchets mounted on wheels were said to have needed 200 men to pull each of them.
By the Qin and Han dynasties, traction trebuchets were a common weapon used in both attack and defense. Later on in 617 Li Mi (Sui dynasty) constructed 300 trebuchets for his assault on Luoyang, in 621 Li Shimin did the same at Luoyang, and onward into the Song dynasty when in 1161, trebuchets operated by Song dynasty soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur against the ships of the Jin dynasty navy during the Battle of Caishi. 
"Whirlwind" and "four footed" trebuchets appeared during the Tang dynasty. The whirlwind trebuchet used a single vertical pole which could be rotated 360 degrees for increased versatility at the cost of projectile strength. The four footed trebuchets were essentially the same as the previous Warring States weapons, differentiated from the whirlwinds by specifying its stability and larger size.
As defensive weapons, traction trebuchets were positioned behind city walls and guided by an "artillery observer" on the walls. Range was determined by the strength and number of men pulling. Increasing and decreasing range meant adding and removing men from the pulling ropes.
The traction trebuchet continued to be used until the counterweight trebuchet was introduced in 1272 during the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty.
Wheel catapult.
A military engineer of the Three Kingdoms period, Ma Jun, devised a device which threw large stones using a wheel. This device consisted of a drum wheel attached with a curved knife. When rotated, the stones which hung on the wheel would be cut loose by the knife and launched. It is not clear how well this device worked in practice. Successful tests with roof tiles instead of stones are mentioned, but according to Liang Jieming, this contraption never made it past the testing phase and could not have been possible with the available technology at the time.
Counterweight trebuchet.
The introduction of the counterweight trebuchet in China is usually attributed to Muslim engineers during the Battle of Xiangyang in 1273, but it is possible that it was independently invented earlier in 1232 by the Jurchen Jin commander Qiang Shen. Qiang Shen invented a device called the "Arresting Trebuchet" which only needed a few men to work it, and could hurl great stones more than a hundred paces, further than even the strongest traction trebuchet. However no details on the construction of the machine are given. Qiang died the following year and no further references to the Arresting Trebuchet appear.
The counterweight trebuchet, known as the Muslim trebuchet (or Huihui Pao) in China, replaced the traction version after its introduction in the late 13th century. Its greater range was however, somewhat countered by the fact that it had to be constructed at the site of the siege unlike traction trebuchets, which were easier to take apart and put back together again where necessary.
The counterweight trebuchet remained in use in China for roughly two centuries, at which point it was well on its way to obsolescence.
Mounted crossbow.
Large crossbows called "bed crossbows" were mounted on rectangular frameworks, often wheeled. Bowstaves were also sometimes combined together to increase tension and initial velocity of the bolt.
Bed crossbow.
Large mounted crossbows known as "bed crossbows" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as humongous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with cords attached so that they could be pulled back. By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used as mobile field artillery and known as "Military Strong Carts". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256. According Juvayni, Hulagu Khan brought with him 3,000 giant crossbows from China, for the siege of Nishapur, and a team of Chinese technicians to work a great 'ox bow' shooting large bolts a distance of 2,500 paces, which was used at the siege of Maymun Diz. Constructing these weapons, especially the casting of the large triggers, and their operation required the highest order of technical expertise available at the time. They were primarily used from the 8th to 11th centuries.
Joseph Needham on the range of the triple-bow crossbow:
Multiple bolt crossbow.
The multiple bolt crossbow appeared around the late 4th century BC. A passage dated to 320 BC states that it was mounted on a three-wheeled carriage and stationed on the ramparts. The crossbow was drawn using a treadle and shot 10 foot long arrows. Other drawing mechanisms such as winches and oxen were also used. Later on pedal release triggers were also used. Although this weapon was able to discharge multiple bolts, it was at the cost of reduced accuracy. It had a maximum range of 500 yards.
When Qin Shi Huang's magicians failed to get in touch with "spirits and immortals of the marvellous islands of the Eastern Sea", they excused themselves by saying large monsters blocked their way. Qin Shi Huang personally went out with a multiple bolt crossbow to see these monsters for himself. He found no monsters but killed a big fish.
In 99 BC, they were used as field artillery against attacking nomadic cavalry.
In 759 AD, Li Quan described a type of multiple bolt crossbow capable of destroying ramparts and city towers:
In 950 AD, Tao Gu described multiple crossbows connected by a single trigger:
The weapon was considered obsolete by 1530.
Incendiaries.
Prior to the introduction of gunpowder, fire arrows used mineral oil and sulphur as incendiaries. They were most commonly used by defenders to burn enemy siege engines such as ladders and rams. They were also used create fires in defending cities.
Gunpowder.
When gunpowder arrived in the 10th century, fire arrows switched to gunpowder incendiaries. Production of gunpowder and fire arrows heavily increased in the 11th century as the court centralized the production process, constructing large gunpowder production facilities, hiring artisans, carpenters, and tanners for the military production complex in the capital of Kaifeng. One surviving source circa 1023 lists all the artisans working in Kaifeng while another notes that in 1083 the imperial court sent 100,000 gunpowder arrows to one garrison and 250,000 to another. When the Jin captured Kaifeng in 1126 they captured 20,000 fire arrows for their arsenal.
Gunpowder was also used in fire balls launched by trebuchets. "Barbed fire balls" used a series of hooks to latch onto its target. A "molten metal bomb" also saw use during the Jin siege of Kaifeng in 1126. These were ceramic containers filled with molten metal kept in a mobile furnace.
Fire birds were a form of live delivery system for incendiaries. A walnut sized piece of burning tinder was tied to the birds' neck or leg. The idea was that once released, they would settle on the roofs of the enemy city, setting fire to the thatch.
The fire ox was another live delivery system. The ox was let loose with two spears attached to its sides and an incendiary tied to its behind. Later on a delayed-action bomb was also added.
Greek fire entered the Chinese arsenal around the year 900. The flamethrower consisted of a brass container and a horizontal pump connected to the gunpowder ignition chamber. When pushed, the pump caused burning petrol to squirt out. It was recommended that these devices be placed on the walls so that when rolls of straw were thrown at siege engines, they would be ignited by the petrol fire. Flamethrowers were also used at sea, sometimes disastrously. In 975 the commander of Southern Tang's navy panicked when enemy ships assaulted them with a barrage of arrows. In desperation, he projected petrol from flamethrowers at the enemy, but a sudden northern wind blew the flames in the opposite direction, setting his entire fleet ablaze. The commander jumped into the fire and died.
Chemical warfare.
Gas bombs consisting of gunpowder mixed with various poisons wrapped in hemp and moxa were used as defensive weapons. These were said to cause great discomfort in the enemy, having effects such as bleeding from the mouth and nose. Other than poison, lime and excrement were also used for their noxious and blinding properties.

Cast saw

A cast saw is an oscillating power tool used to remove orthopedic casts. Unlike a circular saw with a rotating blade, a cast saw uses a sharp, small-toothed blade rapidly oscillating or vibrating back and forth over a very small angle to cut material. This device is often used with a cast spreader.
The patient's skin frequently comes into contact with the cast saw blade without cutting although it can cause lacerations when used over bony prominences. The design enables the saw to cut rigid materials such as plaster or fiberglass while soft tissues such as skin move back and forth with the blade, dissipating the shear forces, preventing injury. A general technique in the use of cast saw often involves a demonstration before actually cutting the cast.
Modern cast saws date back to the plaster cast cutting saw which was submitted for patent on April 2, 1945 by Homer H. Stryker, an orthopaedic surgeon from Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Cast removal procedures result in complications in less than 1% of patients. These complications can include skin abrasions or thermal injuries from friction between the saw and cast. Temperatures exceeding have been recorded during removal of fiberglass casts. Proper use of the saw is to perforate (instead of cutting) the cast, which can then be separated using a cast spreader.
Alternatives include cast cutting shears which were patented in 1950 by Neil McKay.

Maria Luisa Doseva-Georgieva

Maria Luisa Doseva-Georgieva (, 8 September 1894 – 11 April 1975) was one of the first two women licensed as an architect in Bulgaria. She built many well-known sites in the city of Burgas, including the Boulevard Hotel, the residence of , many commercial buildings, as well as schools. In 1968, she was awarded a gold badge and made an honorary member of the .
Early life.
Maria Luisa Doseva was born on 8 September 1894 in Targovishte, Bulgaria to Konstantin Dosev, a banker and merchant who served in the National Assembly for several terms. She completed her primary and lower secondary education in Targovishte, before entering high school in Veliko Tarnovo. Upon her graduation from high school, in Varna, she received recognition from the Ministry of Education. Though architecture was considered a male occupation in her era, Doseva moved to Germany in 1913 to enroll at the Technical University of Munich, but was refused admittance based on her gender. Intent on studying architecture, she applied to the Technical University of Darmstadt and was accepted for the 1913 term. After completing her first year studies, Doseva returned to Bulgaria to complete her practice internship and requested work in southern Bulgaria, where there was a building boom caused by the large number of refugees who had settled around Haskovo after the Balkan Wars. She graduated on 20 December 1917, with an architectural degree, a few weeks after Elena Markova (), a fellow student in Darmstadt, who was from Sophia, and was awarded authorization to work as an architect from the Ministry of Public Buildings, Roads and Public Works. For a brief time after her graduation, Doseva returned to Targovishte, where she married Minko Georgiev, an architecture student she had met in Darmstadt on 5 January 1918.
Career.
The couple soon moved to Stara Zagora, Georgiev's home town, where their son, Georgi, was born. Because of a lack of work there, the family moved to Burgas, where Georgiev was appointed as a state architect. Doseva-Georgieva opened an office in their home at 25 Ferdinandova Street in 1920 and was hired to design a house in September of the same year. As her reputation grew, she worked on commercial buildings as well as residential properties in Burgas and the eastern cities of Sliven, Varna and Yambol. Their family also expanded as two daughters, Liliana and Milka were born. In addition to her architectural work, Doseva-Georgieva was active in women's social improvement projects. She co-founded the first kindergarten in Burgas, as well as a tailoring school to train girls in the profession. She was involved in the charitable organization "Mercy" () and actively worked on projects through the "Independent Women's Association "Self-consciousness"" () to improve civic and social access and protect the rights of women and children.
Doseva-Georgieva designed emblematic buildings incorporating an eclectic mix of European and Arabic influences. Between 1920 and 1921, she designed the Boulevard Hotel in Burgas, near the railway station on Alexandrovska Street (later renamed Czechoslvakia Street). The building incorporated elements of the German secessionist movement with geometric forms and ornamentation of Islamic origin. In 1923, she designed the home of the merchant, Peter Kiulyumov (sometimes styled as Chulumov) () at #18 Prince Alexander Batenberg Street, which was followed by a residence for on the corner of Aleko Bogoridi Boulevard and Mihail Lermontov Street, as well as homes for other prominent citizens. Appointed as a project architect for schools, she designed educational facilities for Izvor, Kableshkovo, Kameno, Primorsko, Ravna Gora, Rusokastro, Sredets and Troyanovo, as well as other small towns and villages.
After her husband died in 1947, Doseva-Georgieva was appointed as overseer and controller of the regional design organization in Burgas. In 1968, she was presented with the golden badge of the and installed as an honorary member of the organization. She worked as an architect until 1973, when she retired.
Death and legacy.
Doseva-Georgieva died on 11 April 1975 in Burgas. She is remembered as the first woman to practice architecture in Bulgaria, as though she was not the first to be licensed, Elena Markova, did not work in the field after she received her license and married. The former Boulevard Hotel has been restored and is an icon in the central district of Burgas.

Agnes Kalibata

Agnes Matilda Kalibata is a Rwandan agricultural scientist and policymaker, and president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). She served as Rwanda's minister of agriculture and animal resources from 2008 to 2014 and began her tenure as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) in 2014.
Early life and education.
Kalibata was born in Rwanda and raised as a refugee in Uganda to parents who were smallholders. She earned a bachelor's degree in entomology and biochemistry, followed by a master's degree in agriculture, both from Makerere University in Uganda. She then earned a Ph.D. in entomology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After graduating in 2005, she carried out research at the Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University and the University of Massachusetts.
Career.
Kalibata served as Rwanda's minister of agriculture and animal resources from 2008 to 2014. Throughout her tenure, she promoted the use of science-based approaches to agriculture to increase food production and improve food security, with a focus on family farmers. She implemented policies, designed to connect farmers with neighbors and customers, as well as cooperative farming programs, and cow-sharing programs that made it easier for families to own cows.
In the six years she was minister, Rwanda's poverty level dropped more than 50 percent; its agricultural sector's annual budget grew from under US$10 million to over US$150 million; and Rwanda became the first country to sign a compact under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (an initiative of the African Union Commission). She has been praised by many for these accomplishments, but some human rights groups have criticized the policies because financial support was only given to farmers who followed the government's land consolidation policies.
In 2014, she served briefly as the University of Rwanda's deputy vice chancellor for institutional advancement.
Since September 2014, she has served as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), an African-led organization whose mission is to improve the food security and incomes of 30 million faming households in 11 African countries by 2021 by, among other things, providing access to better seeds and credit. She is also on the board of the International Fertilizer Development Center and the administrative center of Anand, Gujarat.
Kalibata has held multiple roles in MINAGRI, Rwanda's Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources; she was appointed permanent secretary of the ministry in 2006, Minister of State in Charge of Agriculture in 2008, and full Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources in 2009. She has also held numerous other positions including chair of the board of the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and chair of the Rwanda's National Clinical Research Center. She served on the International Food Policy Research Institute's Advisory Council and managed a World Bank project in Rwanda.
Kalibata has been a member of the International Fertilizer Development Center (IDFC)'s board of directors since 2008, where she chairs the board's Africa Committee and is a member of their executive and audit committees. She is also a member of many national and international boards including for the University of Rwanda, Africa Risk Capacity, the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council, the Global Commission on Adaptation and the Malabo Montpellier Panel of Agriculture and Food Security Experts.
In 2019, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Kalibata as his special envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit.
Political positions.
Kalibata has been instrumental in advocating for gender equality in Rwanda, emphasizing the economic benefits of encouraging women to play a more public role in society as Rwanda recovered from the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed 800,000 people in three months and left Rwanda's population 60% female.
Honors and awards.
In 2012, Kalibata was awarded the Yara Prize (now called the Africa Food Prize), which recognizes an outstanding individual or institution leading the effort to change the reality of farming in Africa.
In 2018, the University of Liege, Belgium awarded her an honorary doctorate for distinguished leadership (2018).
She was the recipient of the 2019 NAS Public Welfare Medal: described by the National Academies of Sciences as its most prestigious award, this medal is awarded annually to a scientist using science for the public good.

Guglielmo Cappa

Guglielmo Cappa (1844-1905) was an Italian engineer who became Head of the Material and Traction Service of the newly formed Italian State Railways (FS) in 1905.
Overview.
Guglielmo Cappa was born in Garlasco, in the Province of Pavia on 21 July 1844. He attended high school and spent two years at University in Pavia. He then obtained a degree in engineering in Turin.
Career.
In 1871 he was hired by the Società per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali and was engaged in the construction of the difficult line between L'Aquila and Sulmona. He later became Head of the Traction Division of the Società per le Strade Ferrate Calabro-Sicule. In 1885 when the Sicilian railroads were broken up with the establishment of Rete Sicula, headed by Riccardo Bianchi, Cappa became the director of the Material and Traction Service. He was one of the main promoters of the establishment of the ferry in the Strait of Messina that began at the end of 1899.
The work of the engineer Cappa was decisive in the design of new locomotives such as the RS Class 300, which later became the FS Class 410, but his main work was the excellent RS Class 400 tank locomotives, later FS Class 910.[] These were designed for the difficult Messina - Palermo line with the demanding Peloritani pass. After nationalization, they were transferred to Milan where they gave excellent service on suburban trains.
A characteristic of the locomotives designed by Cappa was the use of Walschaerts valve gear which became widely adopted by the FS. In 1905 Riccardo Bianchi, director of the newly constituted Ferrovie dello Stato, wanted Cappa in Rome to direct the Material and Traction Service.
Family.
Guglielmo Cappa was the father of Giulio Cesare Cappa, who became an automobile designer for the firm Aquila Italiana.
Death.
In Rome, a tragic fate overtook Guglielmo Cappa a few months after his inauguration. On 1 September 1905, he was shot dead in his office in Via Boncompagni, by the Sardinian Giuseppe Cossu, who held him responsible for the lack of promotion of his son from stoker to driver.

Liquidambar acalycina

Liquidambar acalycina, Chang’s sweet gum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Altingiaceae (formerly Hamameliaceae), native to southern China. Growing to tall by broad, It is a medium-sized deciduous tree with three-lobed maple-like leaves that turn red in autumn before dropping. It is monoecious, meaning that both male and female flowers appear on the same plant. The flowers are insignificant, yellow/green in colour, and are followed by small gum-balls that persist on the tree until winter. The wood exudes a sweet-smelling resin when pierced, giving the tree its common name.
"Liquidambar acalycina" is cultivated as an attractive ornamental tree for parks and gardens, and is hardy down to or less. It requires cultivation in reliably moist, acid to neutral soil in full sun or partial shade. The cultivar ‘Burgundy Flush’, with leaves opening purple, then green, then burgundy red in autumn, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.
Characteristics.
Liquidambar acalycina is a deciduous tree that has a brown to black colored bark with a conical/pyramidal shape. It matures quickly to be of a medium height ranging at 10m in height, and 6m width. The leaves have three lobes which make the tree similar to a Maple. However, they are more star shaped than maple leaves.
The leaves emerge with a burgundy color in spring but as they grow and mature in summer, they become green which indicates their increasing ability to photosynthesize. When nearing fall the colors turn back into a red to purple color.
During the months of April to May, monoecious flowers begin to bud with yellow-green colors, but are insignificant for pollination in attracting pollinators. The fruit of this tree is a dark brown black color. This tree serves as a shade tree for gardens. This Sweetgum Tree prefers soil that is acidic, clay-based, and sunlight.
Distribution.
This tree is native to East Asia, specifically in Southeast China. Other species can be found in Southern China and the United States of America.
Disease and Infestation.
This tree is generally stable in the specific climates in which it exists. However, some insects can infest the tree, such as webworms, bagworms, caterpillars, leaf miners, and borers. Other issues that some trees experience in this species are canker and bleeding necrosis, and can become extreme. If the plant is growing in alkaline soils, the trees may experience iron chlorosis. Other issues include dark spots on leaves, and wood rot.

Won't You Be My Neighbor? (film)

Won't You Be My Neighbor? is a 2018 American documentary film about the life and guiding philosophy of Fred Rogers, the host and creator of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood", directed by Morgan Neville. The trailer for the film debuted on what would have been Rogers's 90th birthday, March 20, 2018.
The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released in the United States on June 8, 2018. It received acclaim from critics and audiences and grossed over $22 million, becoming the top-grossing biographical documentary ever produced and the 12th largest-grossing documentary ever produced.
It was nominated for numerous awards, won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, and was chosen by "Time" magazine as one of its top ten films of 2018.
Premise.
Filmmaker Morgan Neville examines the life and legacy of Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the popular children's television program "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood".
Production.
One of the film's producers was Nicholas Ma, son of the famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma. As a child, the younger Ma appeared twice as himself in "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood".
Release.
"Won't You Be My Neighbor?" was shown at many film festivals including on January 19, 2018, at the Sundance Film Festival, February 24, 2018, at the Boulder International Film Festival, March 2, 2018, at the True/False Film Festival, March 16, 2018, at the Miami Film Festival, and May 5, 2018, at the Montclair Film Festival. It had a limited release in US theaters on June 15, 2018. PBS aired the film on February 9, 2019, as part of the network's "Independent Lens" series.
In November 2018, director Morgan Neville revealed that the original title of the film was "The Radical Mister Rogers", but after the election of Donald Trump, the term "radical" had a negative connotation according to Neville.
Reception.

"Won't You Be My Neighbor?" made $475,419 from 29 theaters in its first weekend, and $1 million from 96 theaters in its second. Expanding to 348 theaters the following week, it grossed $1.9 million, finishing tenth at the box office.

On July 27, the film became the highest-grossing biographical documentary of all-time, and on August 12 passed "Bowling for Columbine" to become the 12th-highest-grossing documentary overall.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 252 reviews, and an average rating of 8.70/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?" takes a fittingly patient and honest look at the life and legacy of a television pioneer whose work has enriched generations." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
Leslie Felperin of "The Guardian" gave the film a score of 4 stars out of 5, writing that the film "reveals that [Rogers] really was just what he seemed to be at first innocent sight: a kind-hearted, square but saintly man who genuinely loved and understood children." Amy Nicholson of "Variety" wrote: "Neville's fantastic archival footage reveals the man through his work—or at least, it reveals his philosophies, if not the childhood memories that gave Rogers the ability to understand a four-year-old's brain, almost as if he still carried his in his cardigan pocket." 
David Edelstein of "New York" magazine wrote: "the most important thing we’re meant to take away is that no matter how we look or feel (sad, mad, plaid), we’re special, each of us, loved unconditionally by this nice, nice man." He concluded: ""Won’t You Be My Neighbor?" is a wonderful breather from reality, from which you come back more conscious of — and dismayed by — the hate that more than ever runs the world."
J. R. Jones, writing for the "Chicago Reader", was more critical of the film in his review, saying: "Nobody wants to hate on Mr. Rogers, so Neville quickly brushes aside the conservative criticism that "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" ... may have helped foster our modern American culture of self-involvement and hypersensitivity. This gentle, positive treatment of Rogers coincides with the show's values but devalues his enormous social importance."
In December 2018, former US President Barack Obama listed the film as one of his favorite films of 2018.

<doc id="56941585" url="?curid=56941585" title="Beau Geste hypothesis">
Beau Geste hypothesis

The Beau Geste hypothesis in animal behaviour is the hypothesis which tries to explain why some avian species have such elaborate song repertoires, for the purpose of territorial defence. The hypothesis' name comes from the 1924 book "Beau Geste", and was first coined by John Krebs in 1977.
Background.
The Beau Geste hypothesis which was coined by Krebs in 1977 to explain why various avian species have such large song repertories. The hypothesis discusses that avian species utilize such large song repertories for potentially a number of reasons such as for territorial defence and to test the competition within a new habitat.
The name of the hypothesis comes from the book which was originally published in 1924 "Beau Geste". The book tells the story of three English brothers which all enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and ended up in a desert battle against a Tuareg army. They were greatly outnumbered, and in order to create the illusion that they had more men than they actually had, they took whatever dead soldiers they could find and propped them up along the walls of the fortress.
Non-avian species.
There has been mention of this hypothesis in places such as research into amphibian vocalizations in the "Boophis madagascariensis", an endemic species of tree frog found in Madagascar, where the Beau Geste hypothesis is used to give one explanation of why the species has such a large vocal repertoire. There has been some support for the theory in that the frogs use a wide variety of songs to give the illusion to invading frogs that the territory they are trying to enter is already full of competing frogs.
The Beau Geste hypothesis has also been found to explain vocalizations within some cricket species such as the bush cricket, where males use a wide variety of songs to access the amount of competition which is in a given area. When males are present in an area with a large number of other males their vocal repertories are much smaller than when in an area with only a few males.

Thomas Nelson Baker Sr.

Reverend Dr. Thomas Nelson Baker, Sr. was a minister, author and philosopher. Born into slavery, Baker was the first African-American to receive a PhD in philosophy in the United States.
Biography.
Baker was born in Eastville, Virginia, on August 11, 1860. His parents were Thomas Chadwick and Edith Nottingham Baker, who were slaves on Robert Nottingham’s plantation in Northampton County, Virginia.
His father became a Union soldier, and after the Civil War, Baker's mother taught him to read, which was a crime during slavery.
My mother taught me my letters, although I well remember when she learned them herself. My first reading lesson was the second chapter of Matthew, the Bible being the only book we had. I never read a bad book in my life which is one of the blessings I got by being poor. I began to attend the common schools at eight and learned to love books passionately. I used to read through my recesses. Evenings I read the Bible to my parents and grandparents, while they listened with weeping eyes, thankful that I had the great blessing of being able to read.
When he was 12, his father took him out of school, which left him with a burning desire to get an education. After nine years of a "bookless life," he entered Hampton Institute High School program, where he graduated as valedictorian.
To prepare for college, he enrolled at Mount Hermon Boys School in 1886, where he was one of only two black students. He was 25 when he started, and would serve as substitute principal in the summer months. He graduated from Mount Hermon in June 1889. In 1890, he entered Boston University and graduated three years later as the valedictorian of his class. He then studied at Yale Divinity School, where he earned a degree, and was ordained as a minister at a Congregational Church on Dixwell Avenue in New Haven. He continued at Yale, where he was awarded a Ph.D in Philosophy in 1903. His dissertation topic: "The Ethical Significance of the Connection Between Mind and Body."
He left New Haven for Pittsfield to become the minister at Second Congregational Church August 1, 1901, a position he held for 37 years. He succeeded the Rev. Dr. Samuel Harrison.
Baker's ideas on race put him in the middle of the early 20th century debates between W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington. The philosopher George Yancy has written numerous articles about Baker, explaining that he believed his work had been neglected.
His wife Lizzie Baytop Baker, a leader among African American women in Western Massachusetts, predeceased him. Rev. Dr. Baker died at home from an accidental gas poisoning on February 22, 1941. His son, Dr. T. Nelson Baker, Jr., was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry from Ohio State in 1941. His first grandson, Dr. T. Nelson Baker, III, earned a Ph.D. in chemistry from Cornell University in 1963. Newman Taylor Baker, his second grandson, and Andrea Baker, one of his great-grandchildren, are international musical artists.

Corticobasal syndrome

Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a rare, progressive atypical Parkinsonism syndrome and is a tauopathy related to frontotemporal dementia. CBS is typically caused by the deposit of tau proteins forming in different areas of the brain.
Classification.
CBS is the most common type of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) although the terms CBD and CBS have been used interchangeably in the past. The other three phenotypes of CBD are:
Symptoms and signs.
Symptoms of CBS include apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, frontal deficits, and extrapyramidal motor symptoms such as myoclonus or rigidity. Movement deficits often begin on one side and progress to the other.
Pathophysiology.
CBD is the pathology underlying approximately 50% of CBS cases.
Diagnosis.
The Armstrong criteria were proposed in 2013; the accuracy of these is limited and further research is needed. Symptoms may be symmetric or asymmetric, with one or more of the following:
The onset is insidious with gradual progression, lasting one year or more, with no exclusion criteria present. The diagnosis is more likely if onset is after age 50, there is no family history (2 or more relatives), and there is no genetic mutation affecting T (e.g., MAPT).
Probably sporadic CBS is more likely if there are two of:
The diagnosis is excluded if there is evidence of:
The diagnostic criteria for clinical use may result in a misdiagnosis of other tau-based diseases.
The "probable" criteria are proposed for clinical research.
Differential.
Other degenerative pathologies that can cause corticobasal syndrome include:
The symptoms of classic CBS differ from CBD in that CBD also includes cognitive deficits in the executive functions.
Prognosis.
The average survival time after disease onset is estimated at 6.5  years.

Susan Skoog

Susan Skoog (1965- ), American filmmaker, is best known for her low-budget but highly acclaimed debut film "Whatever" (1998). Asked why she felt the desire to make the film, Skoog explained to "IndieWIRE": "I felt like I hadn’t seen in film what I saw when I was a teenager. And especially from a female perspective. I felt like there hadn’t been a film that really nailed what it was like to be a suburban girl growing up in this country." Skoog has expressed repeatedly that the female experience/perspective, particularly that of girls, has historically been underrepresented in the film industry (e.g., "Boys tend to blame their circumstances and the world outside them, whereas girls tend to blame themselves and quit. Girls quit much quicker and easier, and I think that hadn’t been dealt with in film yet."), but she believes that is changing by way of a "natural progression" toward sex equality.
Skoog was raised in the town of Red Bank, New Jersey, and graduated from NYU in 1987 with a degree in theatre and film. She has cited Mike Leigh and Eric Rohmer as influences on her work.

Kimberly Reed

Kimberly Reed is an American film director and producer who is best known for her documentaries "Prodigal Sons" and "Dark Money" which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. In 2007, "Filmmaker" magazine named her one of the "25 New Faces of Independent Film."
Early life.
Kimberly Reed was born in Montana and attended Helena High School.
Education.
Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts from University of California at Berkeley where she graduated magna cum laude. Reed earned a Master of Arts in film production from San Francisco State University.
Career.
Throughout her career, Reed has pursued projects across artistic venues. As a filmmaker, Reed's work has been featured at festivals and across platforms. Her most recent project is the film Dark Money which, "examines one of the greatest present threats to American democracy: the influence of untraceable corporate money on our elections and elected officials." Earlier work has explored LGBT issues, families, and the transgender community in New York City. Reed also wrote an opera and her written work has been featured in a number of print publications and other forums.
Film.
"Dark Money".
"Dark Money" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018. Variety describes the film as a "potent investigative piece." In early 2018 the film traveled to several festivals and the rights to the film were purchased by PBS and will be broadcast in fall 2018 as part of the POV series of documentaries. Dark Money is Kimberly Reed's sophomore documentary and explores the influence on dark money in Montana politics and beyond post-"Citizens United."
"Prodigal Sons".
"Prodigal Sons" is an autobiographical account of Kimberly Reed's return home to Montana for her 20th high school reunion as a trans woman. The film evolves into an exploration of family, sibling rivalry, coming out, and reconciling with the past. It debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in 2008.
The Los Angeles Times describes Prodigal Sons as follows: "At the heart of 'Prodigal Sons,' a family drama in the form of a succinct, eloquent personal journal, is a sibling rivalry whose reverberations touch upon the very essence of human identity: what we inherit, what we learn, how we move forward and to what degree we look back. Reed receives a warm reception at her 20-year reunion, but she's on eggshells with one of her classmates, her adopted brother. Since he was left back in preschool, Marc has been the struggler to her high achiever, his behavior problems exacerbated by a brain injury. He's on multiple meds and given to hair-trigger explosions that he says aren't the real him -- even as Kim looks at pictures of herself as a boy and says with certainty, 'That wasn't me."'"Reed's work on this project earned her much acclaim including a place on Filmmaker Magazine's list of "25 New Faces of Independent Film," several award nominations including a GLAAD Media Award and [[Chlotrudis Award] for Best Documentary]. The film was met with both popular and critical acclaim. It was released in theaters and was among [[IndieWire]]'s top 10 films of 2008.

JeeYoung Lee

JeeYoung Lee (; born 1983) is a South Korean visual artist. She graduated from Hongik University in Seoul and received the Sovereign Art Prize in 2012. Her photographs are held in the Kyoto Photographic Museum in Japan, the Incheon Foundation for Art and Culture, and Seoul's OCI Museum.
Lee is known for her surreal images, which she creates by physically transforming her studio space into intricate and imaginative dreamscapes using hand-constructed props and then photographing them without digital manipulation. Restrained by conventional photography medium, Lee added plastic creativity and theatrical performance to it.
Early life.
JeeYoung Lee grew up aspiring to be a painter, and her first step to making it a reality was when she enrolled at an art high school. She then attended Hongik University to pursue a degree in Visual Communication Design. At the time, she was interested in film production art, but after taking a break from school to work as an assistant in a commercial production company, Lee realized that she would not take that path. While in search for a career path that would allow her to fully express her creativity, she worked on a photography exhibition as a project that helped her attain her bachelor's degree. This led her to find her niche, photography, and to continue her studies on the topic going into graduate school.
Works.
Lee's art can be broken down into building, capturing, and then destroying. She uses the process of building the set as a way to relax herself from social repression and frustration, and to reflect about her inner conflicts, seeking to express them outwards. She then uses photography as a medium to record her reality. By finally destroying the set in the end, she puts the moment back in the past. Lee describes this entire process as a practice of emotional discipline.
It takes about two to three months for Lee to complete one of her works. She works in a small, 12 x 14 x 8 feet studio to create the entirety of her elaborate scenes, removing the need for any photoshop at the end.
Notable Pieces.
Resurrection
This work was created in inspiration from the Tale of Sim Chong, a Korean folktale. Lotus flowers in Asian cultures symbolize rebirth and purity. By placing herself within the Lotus flower, Lee expresses how she has been reborn into a stronger figure, having overcome the negative elements in her life that were dragging her down.
Anxiety
This work addresses common worries, insecurity, and doubts that we experience in our daily lives. Unlike most of her other works, that involve a single photograph, Lee has taken two photographs as well as a video. The video features a performer making a strange noise, which is the phrase “it’s okay” cut into single syllables and being read as if she's singing. In an interview with CNN, Lee mentions that this work was one of the most memorable to her in that it was quite experimental.
Influences.
Lee sees her art as a mode of self-expression in that she portrays snippets of her own memories, dreams or anxieties in her work. She also draws inspiration from Korean fables and famous artworks.
Lee's creative combination of unusual plastic elements, as well as the expression of the unconscious mind, places her works at the very heart of Surrealism.
Her style is most comparable to German sculptor and photographer Thomas Demand, as well as U.S. installation artist and photographer Sandy Skoglund. It is unclear whether or not she was directly influenced by their works.
In an interview JeeYoung Lee mentions that some of her favorite artists include Kusama Yayoi, Tim Burton, and Michel Gondry.
Exhibitions.
Lee's first group exhibition took place in 2007, in her home country Korea. In addition to having her first solo exhibition in Korea in 2009, she branched out and had her first solo exhibitions abroad in 2014. She now holds exhibitions both group and solo around the world and has had exhibitions in Australia, USA, Taiwan, and Ireland.

Lee's work is featured in the following collections:

2018 Kentucky Wildcats football team

The 2018 Kentucky Wildcats football team represented the University of Kentucky in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Wildcats played their home games at Kroger Field in Lexington, Kentucky and competed in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by sixth-year head coach Mark Stoops.
The season was one of the most successful in Kentucky's history. In Kentucky's second game of the season, the team ended the then-longest current losing streak in an uninterrupted series in FBS when they defeated Florida for the first time since 1986, and the first time in Gainesville since 1979, ending a losing streak of 31 games. Two weeks later, the Wildcats upset No. 14 Mississippi State, and entered the AP Poll for the first time since 2007. Kentucky ended the regular season tied for second in the SEC East Division with a conference record of 5–3. They were invited to the Citrus Bowl, where they defeated No. 13 Penn State, their first bowl win since 2008. Kentucky ended the season with a record of 10–3 and were ranked 12th in the final AP Poll, the most wins and highest poll finish for the program since 1977.
The team's highly touted defense was anchored by unanimous All-American linebacker Josh Allen, who was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year and led the conference in sacks and tackles for loss. Allen won several national awards for defensive excellence, including the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, and the Lott Trophy; he became the first Kentucky player to receive any of these awards. On offense, the team was led by first-team All-SEC running back Benny Snell, who finished second in the conference in rushing with 1,449 yards and 16 touchdowns. Offensive lineman Bunchy Stallings was also named first-team all-conference. Quarterback Terry Wilson led the team in passing, finishing with 1,889 yards and 11 touchdowns. Head coach Mark Stoops was named SEC Coach of the Year.
Previous season.
The Wildcats finished the 2017 season 7–6, 4–4 in SEC play to finish in a tie for third place in the Eastern Division. They were invited to the Music City Bowl where they lost to Northwestern.
Offseason.
Spring game.

Auroraphoca

Auroraphoca is an extinct genus of earless seals from the early Pliocene of what is now the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.
Description.
"Auroraphoca" differs from other monachines by the abrupt distal termination of the deltopectoral crest, and the presence of a reduced and distally located epicondylar crest. It is most similar to "Pliophoca" in the development of the anconeal process on the ulna, and because of this, the holotype USNM 181419 and paratype USNM 250290 were referred to "Pliophoca" by Koretsky and Ray (2008).

Gilberto de Syllos

Gilberto de Syllos is a Brazilian musician and has been a professional bassist and music professor for more than 30 years. Born Gilberto de Syllos Rosa in Campinas, Brazil, on 27 April 1967 he is now based in São Paulo, where he teaches music and performs as a solo artist and with a wide variety of popular Brazilian and international acts.
Career.
De Syllos holds a bachelor's degree in music from Campinas State University (UNICAMP) and is currently (April/2018) a master's degree candidate at the same university.
Since 2002, he has been on the faculty at Faculdade de Música Souza Lima in São Paulo, teaching the Electric and Acoustic Bass programs as well as Music History, Theory, and Ear Training.
De Syllos has authored several books, including “Drumset and Bass in Brazilian Popular Music”, “ “Electric Bass Techniques in Brazilian Popular Music,” and "Baião and Northeastern Brazilian Rhythms.” These last two books have been released in Europe and in the United States by Advance Music Editors. De Syllos participated on the play-along recording and book, “Brazilian Music of Roberto Menescal ” and "Brazilian Music in Odd Metters," which were released by Editora Souza Lima.
As a professor, he has participated in clinics, workshops, and music festivals held in the main cities of Brazil and abroad, most recently in the United States, Venezuela, Germany, and Portugal.
In 2015 he produced the show “Basstucada” (available in English and Portuguese on Youtube which was recorded live at the Sesc Campinas. Basstucada covers the entire career of De Syllos as a player and as a composer.
In 2014, he received a special invitation by the Campinas Symphonic Orchestra to play with singer/composer Ivan Lins in the celebrations of the orchestra's 85th anniversary.
Since 2013 he has been the bass player of the Orquestra Rock de Campinas (SP) in spectacles produced and directed by conductor and Martin Lazarov.
De Syllos has been a columnist for the Brazilian Edition of Bass Player magazine (2012/2013), writing articles about acoustic and upright bass playing .
He composed the soundtrack to Diego Ruiz de Aquino and Helton Ladeira's award-winning short film “Noir” (2007).
He was praised by The New York Times critics and referred to as "the genial Gilberto de Syllos" for his work on the show “da Corda pro Pé” on Broadway in 2006.
His first CD, Tocando Baixo (1996), was nominated for the Prêmio Sharp in 1997.
Over the years, de Syllos has been working on a solo career as a composer and band leader, and has accompanied top Brazilian and International artists like Ivan Vilela, Izzy Gordon, Paulo Jobim, Roberto Menescal, Ná Ozetti, Toninho Ferraguti, Duofel, Hermeto Pascoal, Lenine, Zeca Baleiro, Marlui Miranda, Lupa Santiago, Pedro de Alcântara, Bina Coquet, Hot Jazz Club, Bloody Mary &amp; Os Caipirinhas, Marcelo Onofri, Connie Evingson, Laura Penn, 
Maria Sole (Italy), Sally Burgues (New Zealand), Robin Nolan (Netherlands), Richard Smith (England), Thomas Walburn (Denmark), Connie Evingson, Laura Penn, and Jason S. Smith (USA), Niclas Campagnol (Switzerland), Dario Napoli (Italy) among others, in stage performances and recordings.
More recently, De Syllos has dedicated more of his time to be the dubbing and musical director for Atma Entretenimento, in São Paulo, Brazil, where he creates Brazilian versions for a variety of projects including live-action and animated movies, broadcast series and documentaries, as well as supervising the whole dubbing and music production team in the studio.
Seo Manouche.
Gilberto de Syllos has taken gipsy jazz with so much passion, he has even changed his stage name to Seo Manouche (Brazilian Portuguese for Mister Manouche) whenever he plays this style of music. His first album for this project, the eponymous Seo Manouche, contains original gypsy jazz songs sung in Brazilian Portuguese as shown in the local press and the Brazilian Edition of Bass Player magazine . Seo Manouche brings to light a unique universe where Brazilian root music and gipsy jazz are blended together. In 2015 he released both the CD and the awarded video clip titled "Já Que Tá Que Fique”. In 2017, he released his second album named “Cavaquinho de Itu” in a partnership with songwriter Carlos Castelo (Língua de Trapo).
De Syllos performed with the Bina Coquet Trio in 2017 at the prestigious Django Amsterdam Festival in Holland, where they were cast as showing "a new sound combining Brazilian music with gypsy jazz and Django Reinhardt" and received great reviews from Qintette magazine for his performance. Seo Manouche was the first act to be invited by musicologist Zuza Homem de Mello in his project "Zuzando nas Notas".
When describing the Seo Manouche project, De Syllos remarked “I am part of a small group of Brazilian musicians that are interpreters and performers of the style made famous by Django Reinhardt. I am a founding member of the Hot Jazz Club, pioneers in this style since 2003, with 3 CDs released. I started observing several Brazilian gypsy jazz musicians came from a sophisticated academic world, unlike the European performers. As a matter of fact, there was no tradition in the style in Brazil, however, in the last 5 years, several CDs have been released, with new bands being formed. One of the qualities of such a style in Brazil is that most of the performers follow a blend with the rich universe of Brazilian rhythms such as samba, maxixe, xóte, and frevo, with the result being a sort of hybrid music. For this reason, I consider it most important for my research this previous experience with the Brazilian manouche jazz, which has resulted in enthusiasm and new interpretations of a rhythm that has been played form for more than 80 years in Europe.”
Other Seo Manouche short films include "Esta Canção de Natal" (This Christmas Song), "Cavaquinho de Itu" and "Midnight in São Paulo".
Basstucada.
The Basstucada concert was performed on September 15, 2013 at the Sesc Theater in Campinas, SP, Brazil. Video made available on Youtube on April 28, 2015.
The performance covered the 30-year career of Gilberto de Syllos. The program, divided in two parts had his original songs played by Fábio Bergamini (percussion), Lucas Casacio (drums) e Edu Guimarães (accordion). For the second part, songs and arrangements by Ivan Vilela who played his 10-string Brazilian guitar, with Gilberto de Syllos playing the upright bass and special guest Paula Pi (viola and fiddle).
The concert was first promoted on YouTube, with the musicians explaining their participations and the importance of their instruments, in a comprehensive way. Songs like “Cyclone” and “Brazilian bass” came about written exercises originally released as part of Gilberto's Guide for the Bass Guitar.
”Gilberto de Syllos has an in depth vision of music. This is the result of his multiple activities and talents: musician, composer, producer, researcher and teacher. For each of these talents, one shall add yet some other qualities: virtuoso, inspired, competent, curious, generous – and that is the recipe for a great artist. Basstucada comprises three decades of a career lived onstage, in the studio and on books, where de Syllos has taught us the rightful place of the bass guitar in Brazilian popular music." (Alexandre Pavan – journalist and author of "Timoneiro - Perfil Biográfico de Hermínio Bello de Carvalho”).
De Syllos himself, when describing the Basstucada project, commented: “When choosing the performances, I considered the importance of the musicians involved in each project, the period in which such performances occurred (from 2013 to 2016), how demanding each of the musical performances were, and how successful they were. As a bassist and interpreter of bass lines in each of these concerts, I needed full knowledge of several elements that characterize the music as a language, resulting in an adequate and different interpretation. Basstucada was the performance that had the greatest impact of all, for it was the celebration of 30 years of my career as a musician and composer. It was also the performance that generated the production and recording of the DVD, which comes with the testimony from all the musicians involved in the project and such a format resulted in “didactic performance”. During the testimonies/interviews, the musicians gave explanations about the function of each instrument and their context within the Basstucada concert. Basstucada is an instrumental performance where I use the bass as an extension of my own body, with moments of great interaction with the audience as is the case of “In prompt to you”, which is an improvisation number where musician and audience interact beautifully".

Edwin C. Berry

Edwin C. Berry (1854-1931) was an American hotelier who was among the most successful African-American hoteliers in the country during his era.
Early life and career.
Berry was born at Oberlin, Ohio, in 1854, and was taken by his parents at the age of two years to Albany, Ohio, where unusual school facilities were offered African-American children. When he was old enough, he was sent to the Albany public schools, and when the Albany Enterprise Academy, a school for African-American children, was erected, he was able to attend it for a short time. Unfortunately, his father died in 1870 and young Berry was compelled, at the age of sixteen, to leave school and help provide for his family, in which there were eight children younger than himself.
In his search for work he walked ten miles to Athens, Ohio, and was very happy to secure work in a brick yard at fifty cents a day. In a short time his work improved until he was earning $1.25 a day, the greater part of which he was able to divide with his family. He was never too proud to do any kind of honest labor, and although his work was hard and not inviting, it was the best he could do, and he decided to do it well. During the summers he remained at the brick yard, and in the winters was usually able to find employment in stores or elsewhere as a delivery boy or clerk.
It was during these difficult years that he learned to practice economy. He did not use tobacco or intoxicants; because he could not afford them then. He said he was not able to afford them afterward, either. He also learned to seize opportunities which other boys allowed to slip by them. Whenever a circus came to town the other boys eagerly spent some of their hard earned money to see the show, but young Berry turned the circus to profit. He would rig up a refreshment booth and thus make more money than he would had he stayed at the brick yard. Whenever there were excursions, that form of extravagance in which so many of our people sink their savings, Berry would always get the privilege of selling refreshments on the train, thus enjoying the excursion and making a profit at the same time.
Speaking of economy he said once that on many occasions he has walked ten miles to his home so that he might have an additional twenty-five cents for the dear ones there. While he was working at the brick yard, it was his custom to work every day and half the night, thus making the week nine days long. On rainy days when the brick yard was idle he would find some chores to do, or go to the country after cream for the ice cream makers. The first winter after the death of his father he worked at hauling bricks until his hands were cut to the quick by handling the rough surfaces. He was more than rewarded, however, by earning enough to take home four barrels of flour which were all paid for, at $7.80 per barrel.
His first indoor work was in Parkersburg, West Virginia, where he was employed as errand boy in a dry goods store at $10 per month. Of this amount he regularly sent his mother $8 every month. It was in Parkersburg that he first secured work along the line in which he was afterwards to make so great a success. He got work in an ice cream parlor, where he served as a waiter.
Returning to Athens, he secured employment in a restaurant, where he picked up the profession of catering. He soon became so proficient in this profession that he became personally in demand among the customers of his employers. The thought naturally occurred to him that if he could do so well for others he could do still better for himself.
Meanwhile, in 1878, he married his schoolmate, Miss Mattie Madry, and began housekeeping in one room, in which, however, everything was paid for.
The idea of setting up in business for himself would not leave his mind, but as he had no capital and no credit, the way seemed dark before him. His wife came to his aid. By her intercession her parents were persuaded to allow Berry to put the three dollars which he had been paying them weekly for his wife's board into what they called the "business capital." In a few months he was able to start with his elder brother in the restaurant business with a capital of forty dollars. They commenced as "Berry Brothers", but, as the business was not large enough for two, Berry bought his brother out and went along alone.
When Berry's employer learned that his best employee was about to set up as his rival, he was angry, and warned Berry that if he failed and returned looking for employment he would not get it, or even a meal if he were hungry. Berry had the pleasure some time later of materially assisting this man when he himself got into trouble.
The business prospered from the first, and by 1880 Berry was able to buy a lot for $1,300. As soon as the lot was paid for, Berry secured a loan of $2,000 and put up his first building, which is to-day a part of the Hotel Berry. He did a prosperous trade as caterer and confectioner and soon had to hire a young man as assistant.
The Hotel Berry.
Berry's success continued until 1893, when he decided to enter the hotel business. At first the outlook was gloomy. In the first place, the merchants of Athens met and decided to boycott any traveling salesman who stopped at the Hotel Berry. In July 1893 occurred the great panic, and on many a night Berry closed up with only one guest on the register. He had incurred a mortgage of $8,000 at seven percent interest. and was compelled to apply at the banks to borrow money to meet his notes. On one occasion both banks in the city refused to let him have money. He was almost in despair. As Berry was going out of the second bank a friend of his, who was standing by, seeing the look of distress on his face, asked him what the trouble was. Berry told him. The friend drew $500, the sum needed, from his private deposit and handed it to Berry, telling him to take it and use it without interest until he could repay it. This is the only time in his career, Berry said, that any person offered him any encouragement beyond empty words.
The panic subsided, and the merchants were unable to drive the salesmen from Berry's hotel. One example will show the methods used by Berry to make his hotel popular. At night, after his guests had fallen asleep, it was his custom to go around and gather up their clothes and take them to his wife, who would add buttons which were lacking, repair rents, and press the garments, after which Berry would replace them in the guests' rooms. Guests who had received such treatment returned again and brought their friends with them.
The Hotel Berry became the leading hotel in Athens. As of 1907, the hotel had fifty rooms, with baths and all modern conveniences, and an elevator. The hotel was so popular that men came from considerable distances just to spend Sunday there, and was a landmark on the trail of commercial travelers. Berry never refused to serve African-American men at his hotel — indeed, he said he would rather lose his customers than to be guilty of that sort of disloyalty.

2015 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina

The 2015 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina took place on March 1, 2015. It was a speech delivered by president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner at the National Congress of Argentina.
Contents and delivery.
AMIA case.
The death of Alberto Nisman, the prosecutor investigating the 1994 AMIA bombing, took place two months before and sparked great political controversy. He had denounced Kirchner for attempting to conceal the role of Iran in it, with the Memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran, and judge Daniel Rafecas rejected the case some days earlier. Kirchner accused Nisman of holding contradictory standards and suggested that Nisman changed his mind for some unknown reason during his vacations, shortly before his death. She pointed that she attended all commemorations of the attack at the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, pointing that it took place during an earlier government, and accused Israel of not holding a similar interest over the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires.
Economy.
Kirchner accused the Vulture funds of trying to disrupt the economy of Argentina, and claimed that she had solved the problem of external debt for Argentina. She also announced that she would send a bill to the congress to nationalize the railway services. She justified the commercial deals with China, and announced bills that would seek to increase the industrial development. She also praised that overall wages had increased over 200% since 2003, when her husband Néstor Kirchner took office. As several economists criticised the state of the economy, she argued that the problems had not turned into a great crisis, and pointed that the summer season was a huge success.
Responses.
Cristina Kirchner mentioned during her speech that the journalist Joseph Cotterill, from the Financial Times, had pointed out that the price of Argentine bonds was on the rise. Cotterill became aware of it within the day, and replied in Twitter: "Thanks for the mention in your speech, @CFKArgentina. But I fear that the bond's price is going up the less time you have left in office".
The state of Israel issued a diplomatic answer to the speech. It pointed out that, although the territory of the Israeli embassy belongs to Israel, the responsibility for the security of the diplomats belongs to the host country.
The speech was criticised by many leaders of the opposition. Senator Ernesto Sanz criticized that it did not mention the high inflation, crime rates and illicit drug trade. He also considered that it was unfair to raise criticism against Nisman, as he was dead. Senator Gerardo Morales criticized the conflictive tone of the speech and the criticisms to the judiciary. Sergio Massa criticized the length of the speech, over 3 hours, and considered that it was out of touch with the people's concerns.

Charles William Saalburg (1865–1947) was an American cartoonist and illustrator who lived in San Francisco, and whose work appeared in the San Francisco "Wasp" and "Examiner", the New York "World", as well as periodicals in Paris and London. In 1894 he created "The Ting Ling Kids" comic strip for the "Chicago Inter Ocean", which is typically considered the earliest regular American newspaper comic strip to be printed in color. As chief of the "World"s color department, he is also credited with giving the bright yellow color to R. F. Outcault's famous character the Yellow Kid: when in 1895 he used the Kid's characteristic oversized shirt to test a new, quick-drying yellow ink.
The Yellow Kid, originally drawn with a blue shirt or in black and white, would give rise to the term "yellow journalism".

2018 Kemerovo fire

On 25 March 2018 at 16:00 local time (9:00 UTC), a fire engulfed the "Zimnyaya vishnya" shopping mall and entertainment complex in Kemerovo, Russia. It killed at least 60 people (more than half of which were children) according to official statements. The blaze started somewhere on the top floor of the four-story complex, and people were seen jumping from windows to escape it. 100 people were evacuated, and another 20 were rescued. Others claim the number of people killed in fire is being covered up, and that the real figure runs into the hundreds.
The Winter Cherry complex.
The Winter Cherry shopping and entertainment complex ( ", torgovo-razvlekatel'nyi kompleks "Zimnyaya vishnya"") is a mall in Kemerovo, Russia.
The mall, which was converted from a former communist-era confectionery factory, opened in 2013 with 23,000 square meters of space, which included a petting zoo, children's center and bowling alley. The building was described as a labyrinth with few windows and points of entrance to the upper levels, with one main staircase, one lift shaft and one escalator.
Fire.
Survivors reported that the fire started on the fourth floor play area, with the heat of the flames rising to 700 °C, the heat so high it caused the bouncy castles to burst into flame. Many of the victims were in the mall's three cinemas, where two of the cinema roofs collapsed from the fourth floor into the third.
Several of the victims in the cinemas were children watching "Sherlock Gnomes" to start off the first day of a week-long school break. A survivor from the cinema claimed that those in the cinema heard no alarm, and had to break through one door and jump to safety. Once on the ground, survivors could only see dense black pungent smoke that had filled the children's playground and the other cinema hall. The fire alarm system at Kemerovo shopping mall was switched off by a security guard.
Many children who were trapped in the fire called loved ones and friends to exchange last conversations and information. One deceased child's aunt recounted their conversation during the fire in which the victim stated; "everything burns and the doors are locked in the cinema."
A spokesperson for the Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that the fire exits in the building were blocked during the fire. Tajik shopkeepers saved around 50 people through an alternate exit. Staff and guards of the center were criticized by survivors for not arranging an organized evacuation effort, while some were praised for their efforts.
Victims.
At least 64 people were killed in the fire, 41 of them children. Also among the fatalities are some 200 animals from the petting zoo. Thirteen people had been hospitalized after the incident with the Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova claiming the most gravely injured was an 11-year-old boy who jumped from a fourth floor window.
Due to the fire, identification of most bodies had to have DNA identification used to confirm identifies. As of March 27, 60 individuals were treated in hospitals, of those 15 were hospitalized and 40 received outpatient care, and 25 victims, including 13 children had been identified.
First responders.
Over 600 first responders spent over 17 hours fighting the flames well into the next day after the fire started. The fire spread to cover more than 1,500 square meters of the 23,000 square meter building, and kept firefighters from entering the building for 12 hours due to the heat and smoke.
A father of three deceased victims was critical of rescuers, claiming he led rescuers up the stairs, but they turned away after being ordered to go elsewhere and refused to give him a respiratory mask citing regulations. In an interview he angrily stated "My daughters were left to burn because of their bloody rules."
Investigation.
The Investigative Committee of Russia (IVR), opened an investigation into the cause of the fire, with the head of the IVR responding critically to the staff. In a statement he claims "Most of the staff ran away and left parents and their children to their fate."
Four people have been detained in relation to the fire, including the head of the shopping complex's managing company. Investigators reported that the fire alarm system had not been working the week leading up to the fire, rising into conflict with a previous report that a security guard turned it off. The mall security guards were cited for failing to promptly turn the voice alert system on and that there is no reasonable explanation to why it occurred.
Kemerovo Oblast deputy governor Vladimir Chernov said that the preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in a children's trampoline room and erupted in the fashion of gunpowder. There is also speculation that the contracted builders and owners of the mall cut safety corners in the electrical wiring. Several arrests of these people have already been made.
Aftermath.
Politicians across the globe sent their condolences. 28 March 2018 was declared the national day of mourning in Russia.
A rally was held in Kemerovo demanding the resignation of Kemerovo Mayor Ilya Seredyuk and the longtime regional governor, Aman Tuleyev.
On April 1, 2018, Aman Tuleyev resigned as the governor of Kemerovo Oblast, citing "a heavy burden" of the Kemerovo fire, and President Putin accepted Tuleyev's resignation.
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry criticized the announcement of expulsions of Russian diplomats by the United States and a number European countries in connection to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter, which happened a day after the tragedy, as showing disrespect to the deceased victims.
Local media named the owner of the mall, as millionaire Denis Shtengelov. Shtengelov countered in an interview that his stake in the mall at the time of the fire was only a minority stake with other investors, however, he promised to pay compensation of 3-million rubles (about $52,500) to the family of each victim. This would be in addition to the regional government's reported compensation to the families of victims, which is equivalent to $17,500 each.
As of July 2018, the building is being demolished. In March 2019, a construction of a park designed by architect John Calvin Weidman, was started at the place of the demolished mall. Named the , it was opened on 15 September 2019.
Memorials and tributes.
Across Russia, central squares were turned into memorials for those killed with flowers and candles. A local memorial was erected in a plaza outside of the shopping center, and there was an influx of individuals donating blood for those injured.
International memorials to the victims were erected in other locations, such as New York City.
Criminal charges.
The Investigative Committee of Russia brought charges under part 3 of Article 293 of the Russian Criminal Code; neglect of duty which has entailed by negligence the death of two or more persons, against the head of a firefighting unit No.2. According to investigation reports lead firefighter did not listen to an eyewitness, who reported that people were locked up on the fourth floor, but sent the unit to a farther location losing time.
Several other criminal cases were initiated with seven individuals being arrested.

Oskélanéo Lake is a freshwater body linked to the southwestern part of the Gouin Reservoir (via Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir), in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake extends entirely in the canton of Faucher. Following the completion of the Gouin Dam in 1948, the navigability between the Gouin Reservoir and Lake Oskélanéo becomes even easier with only two meters of difference in elevation.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
The Canadian National Railway (East-West) cuts Oskélanéo Lake in its middle through the village of Oskélanéo, located on the West Bank.
The route 404 serves the valley of the Oskélanéo River and connects to the Southeast at route 400 which connects the Gouin Dam and the village of Parent, Quebec, also serves the valleys of rivers Jean-Pierre and Leblanc; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . A few secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of Oskélanéo Lake is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.
Toponymy.
The toponym "Lac Oskélanéo" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Lynden Behymer

Lynden Ellsworth (L. E.) (Bee) Behymer (November 5, 1862 – December 16, 1947) was a music and theatrical manager in California for 60 years. In a time of theatrical and musical management typically dominated by large corporations, "Bee," as he was known, operated independently. Upon his death, Rabbi Edgar Magnin commented:, "Because of Behymer, we have a cultured city today."
Early life.
Behymer was born in New Palestine, Ohio during the American Civil War while his father, Aaron S. Behymer, served at the front with the Union Army in the Battle of Gettysburg. Following the war, the family moved to Shelbyville, Illinois, and young Lynden pursued an interest in books and music.
As a young adult, during the Black Hills Gold Rush era, he settled in the Dakota Territory to stake a mining claim. Here he married Minetta Sparks who was a local teacher and principal of a two-room schoolhouse. He became the proprietor of a store in Highmore, Hyde County (now South Dakota). After store and their home were destroyed in a cyclone, the couple relocated to California. He began working at the Grand Opera House in Los Angeles where he worked his way up to press agent and business manager.
Career.
In 1886, Behymer was instrumental in bringing Los Angeles its first important operatic production by the National Grand Opera Company. The first symphony orchestra in Los Angeles was organized by Behymer, who managed it for 18 years. He formed the Philharmonic courses in the larger cities of the American Southwest in conjunction with local music clubs and gradually built up these centers of music to rival those of the East. The Hollywood Bowl idea was formulated at the Behymer home. The first of the Easter services at Mount Rubidoux in Riverside, California, came about through a fiesta given by Behymer that was attended by Theodore Roosevelt. The annual pilgrimage to the mountain at daybreak continues today. At the pinnacle of Behymer’s career, an average season would include about 250 bookings in about 250 cities in California and the West. Behymer started his career offering a variety of entertainment programming that would appeal to all segments of the then-small population. He would mix operatic performances with the likes of Enrico Caruso, Adelina Patti and Sarah Bernhardt with other entertainment by performers like James Whitcomb Riley, Mark Twain or various vaudeville acts.
Performers promoted.
Many of the most famous individual artists in the musical, dramatic, scientific, historical and literary worlds have appeared in Los Angeles, California alone under Behymer’s management. Just a few of thousands of the personalities of the time presented under Mr. Behymer’s direction in the West: Sarah Bernhardt, Nellie Melba, Eleanora Duse, Tommaso Salvini, Edwin Booth, Adelina Patti, Enrico Caruso, Ignace Jan Paderewski, Mei-Lan-Fan, Lily Pons, John Philip Sousa, Anna Pavlova, Isadora Duncan, Maud Allan and Mary Garden. He branched into management of lectures which included those of Mark Twain and James Whitcomb Riley.
Honors.
During Behymer's life he was decorated with 32 foreign honors as well as many local accolades. He held the Dutch Order of Officer of Orange-Nassau, the Serbian Order of St. Sava, the Italian Order of the Crown which made him a Cavalieri of Italy, the French Officer of the Palms, the Grecian Order of the Redeemer which came with a knighthood, the German Artistic Service, the Russian Order of St. Stanislaus, the Order of Danilo, Montenegro. On April 8, 1947, the President of Czechoslovakia presented Mr. Behymer with Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion at a luncheon in Los Angeles attended by 400.

2018 Plymouth City Council election

The 2018 Plymouth City Council election took place on 3 May 2018 to elect members of Plymouth City Council in England. The election was won by the Labour Party, who gained enough seats to achieve an overall majority and took control of the council.
A coalition of Conservative and UK Independence Party (UKIP) councillors had taken control of the council after the 2016 election, with thirty members in total and a working majority. The three UKIP councillors defected to the Conservative Party in September 2017, giving the Conservatives overall control of the council. The Conservative Party defended twelve seats and Labour defended seven.
Background.
Plymouth City Council held local elections on 3 May 2018 along with councils across England as part of the 2018 local elections. The council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election in the fourth year. Councillors defending their seats in this election were previously elected in 2014. In that election, nine Conservative candidates, seven Labour candidates and three UKIP candidates were elected.
In September 2017, the three councillors elected as UKIP candidates defected to the Conservative Party. Following the 2016 Plymouth City Council election, the council had been controlled by a coalition of Conservative and UKIP councillors, with thirty members between them. Following the defections of the UKIP councillors, the Conservative Party held an overall majority, with thirty councillors compared to Labour's twenty-seven.
The "Local Government Chronicle" described Labour as 'well placed to regain control' by winning the seats won by UKIP councillors in 2014. Rob Ford in the "Guardian" wrote that a Labour victory in Plymouth would help the party 'demonstrate strength in critical English swing areas'. The election was the first in which the Liberal Democrats field a candidate in every ward in Plymouth since 2010.
Overall results.
Note: All changes in vote share are in comparison to the corresponding 2014 election.
The Labour Party won an overall majority on the council, with 31 of the council's 57 councillors. The party had last had a majority on the council in 2015. Plymouth was the only council Labour gained control of from the Conservatives in the 2018 local elections.
After the previous election, the composition of the council was:

Asterisks denote sitting councillors seeking re-election.
Aftermath.
Following this election, the Labour group had a majority of councillors. This meant that Labour group leader Tudor Evans became the new leader of Plymouth City Council. Leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn visited Plymouth to celebrate the result. Outgoing council leader Ian Bowyer remained leader of the Conservative group.
Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View Johnny Mercer said that the result was due to Plymouth voters believing that defence funding was reducing under the Conservatives. Defeated Drake councillor Steve Ricketts wrote that his defeat was due to students voting Labour.
"The Herald" described the election as voters deserting UKIP, with Plymouth returning to a two-party political system. The newspaper also emphasised Sima Davarian-Dehsorkhe as the best-performing Liberal Democrat candidate, winning more than 10% of the vote in Plymstock Dunstone.
Labour held its seat in a subsequent by-election in Stoke ward, which took place in July 2018.

Juleen Compton

Juleen Compton (born 1933, Phoenix, AZ) was an American independent filmmaker, writer, and actor. She is best known for "Stranded" (1965) and "The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean" (1966), which she wrote, directed, and financed. She also starred in and distributed "Stranded". 
Career.
"The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean" won a special award at Cannes, as well as an award at the San Francisco Film Festival, and was screened at MoMA in 1970. She studied acting with Lee Strasberg, and performed in a production of Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" in 1955 and played the title role in a production of Jean Anouilh's "Jeannette" in 1960. She also originated the role of Fredrica in John Patrick's Broadway comedy "Good As Gold" in 1957, alongside Roddy McDowall and Zero Mostel, and played Myrrhina in a production of "Lysistrata" in 1959 that re-opened the East 74th Street Theatre. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive likens her work to that of the French New Wave. In 1974 she took part in the first Directing Workshop for Women at the American Film Institute. Compton also at one point began on a documentary of the history of women directors in Hollywood called "Women in Action", "but there's no trace of it." 
In the 1990s Compton moved to New York City to run the Century Center for the Performing Arts, an off-Broadway theater company. Compton's other writing credits include the TV movies "Virginia Hill" (1974), which starred Dyan Cannon and Harvey Keitel, and "Women at West Point" (1979). Her directing credits include "Buckeye and Blue" (1988). A script by Compton entitled "Two Nice Girls" is among a New York Public Library collection of scripts "produced, co-produced, or sponsored" by the New York Shakespeare Festival between 1972 and 1992.
In an article for "The New Yorker" in 2019, film critic Richard Brody, discussing "Stranded", stated that with the film, Compton "places herself boldly in a tradition of director-stars that includes Charlie Chaplin and Erich von Stroheim, Orson Welles and Jacques Tati," as well as "Jean Seberg, Shirley MacLaine, and Judy Garland."
Personal life.
She was married to director and drama critic Harold Clurman from 1960 until his death in 1980, according to some reports. In a 1979 interview in connection with a New York Times piece on Clurman's legacy, Clurman was Compton's "director and acting teacher," and their marriage "lasted anywhere from six months to five years; according to Miss Compton, there is still some question as to the legality of the divorce." According to a biography of Clurman's first wife, actress Stella Adler, Compton "never filed the papers [to divorce Clurman] and consequently inherited certain rights to his writings."
Compton has had a number of real estate dealings: in 1961, The New York Times profiled her on the occasion of her acquiring a $250,000 building on West Thirteenth Street with plans to turn it into a complex with theatres, a drama school, and a restaurant. The same article mentions she previously owned the East 74th Street Theatre. A 1980 New York Times article on architecture mentioned that Compton owned a movie theater at 350 East 72nd Street, and that architect Philip Birnbaum was working on a project for her.
A 2019 Metrograph blog post by film critic Kristen Yoonsoo Kim stated: "Little is known about Compton now. By all accounts, she lives in the Hamptons and goes by the name Justine. Word has it that she dropped by previous Metrograph screenings of her films incognito."
In December 2019, Mexico's Museo Nacional de Arte acquired a 1956 portrait of Compton by Mexican artist Diego Rivera, which was given to the museum by Compton and her husband Nicholas Wentworth. It is possible a second portrait of Compton by Rivera exists, according to coverage by Mexican newspaper "Excélsior." The Rivera portrait, along with a bust of Compton by Jacob Epstein, are mentioned as the two objects Compton kept across her many moves to different residences in a 1970 "New York Times" interview.

The Five Faces of Manfred Mann

The Five Faces of Manfred Mann is the debut British and second American studio album by Manfred Mann. It was first released in the United Kingdom on 11 September 1964 by His Master's Voice. In late October/early November, the album was released in Canada by Capitol Records. The Canadian track listing was almost the same as the UK version, except it included the hit "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" instead of "I've Got My Mojo Working". The record has been called "one of the great blues-based British invasion albums; it's a hot, rocking record that benefits from some virtuoso playing as well".
Background.
The songs on the original version of "the Five Faces of Manfred Mann" are R&amp;B, including the band's cover versions of Howlin' Wolf's "Smokestack Lightning", Muddy Waters' "Got My Mojo Working", and Bo Diddley's "Bring It to Jerome", as well as a few of the group's own jazzy compositions. Particularly noticeable in the instrumental sections are Manfred Mann's keyboard work, Mike Vickers flute and saxophone work, and Mike Hugg's vibes. The album includes the Cannonball Adderley song "Sack O' Woe" from the R&amp;B-influenced school of early 1960s jazz.
Bruce Eder of AllMusic writes:
Reception.
In his retrospective review of the US release, critic Bruce Eder wrote "The band's second American LP (which shares its title with their first British album) was slightly less impressive than their first, but was still a respectable mix of R&amp;B and pop. For pop, there were "Sha La La" and "Come Tomorrow," two of their biggest mid-'60s hits, and "She," one of their best self-penned efforts in that vein. For R&amp;B, there was the original "Hubble Bubble (Toil and Trouble)," a British hit, and some good covers, notably "I'm Your Kingpin," "Groovin'," and "Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron," drawn from a then-recent British EP release.
US version.
The American version of the album (their second U.S. release following "The Manfred Mann Album") was released on 8 February 1965 by Ascot Records (a subsidiary of United Artists) with a very different track listing. This version is more pop-oriented than its predecessor "The Manfred Mann Album", as it features "Sha La La", "Come Tomorrow", and "Hubble Bubble (Toil and Trouble)"; as well as compositions made by lead singer Paul Jones and the traditional American folk number "John Hardy". It also features a smaller section of the band's R&amp;B and jazz influences. It is essentially a whole different album, sharing only two songs with the UK release ("I'm Your Kingpin" and "You've Got to Take It"): the majority of the album already appeared on "The Manfred Mann Album".

Charts.
"The Five Faces of Manfred Mann" peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and is the band's highest charting release on that chart. The U.S. version also charted on the "Billboard" 200, spending four weeks on the chart and peaking at number 141 on 20 March 1965.

Strange Constellations

Strange Constellations is the first full-length studio album by the singer-songwriter William Matheny since the indefinite hiatus of Southeast Engine, released on February 24, 2017. It is his debut release on Misra Records.
Recording.
The album was primarily recorded at Trackside Studio in Huntington, West Virginia. Additional recording took place at 3 Elliott Studio in Athens, Ohio, as well as Ronnie's Place and Electric Thunder, both in Nashville, Tennessee. It was produced and engineered by Bud Carroll (with additional engineering by Justin Francis), and mixed by Francis. Jeff Lipton mastered the album at Peerless Mastering in Boston, Massachusetts, along with assistant mastering engineer Maria Rice.
Release.
The illustration on the album cover was drawn by Bryn Perrott, with graphic design by David Pokrivnak. The album was released by Misra Records on compact disc and a limited-edition silver foil vinyl record for the first run. After it sold out, the LP for the second run became a gold-foil inlaid package.
Reception.
Daytrotter said of Matheny, "If you’re looking for your new favorite Americana rocker, look no further than the wonderful William Matheny," while 
comparing his sound favorably to The Jayhawks and Counting Crows. Additionally, "Living Half to Death" was chosen as a "Heavy Rotation" selection on NPR's Weekend Edition, stating that "Matheny has a knack for spinning stores about roach-infested apartments and social anxiety into indie gold.". Nashville Scene called it "a stout volume that folds some expert old-school storytelling into smart, nimble songs", while Paste praised it as "the perfect fusion of alt-country, rock, roots and pop."

La Toilette (Toulouse-Lautrec)

La Toilette, also known as Rousse, is an 1889 painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The painting depicts a red-headed woman, stripped to the waist, seated on the floor, facing away from the viewer, just before or just after bathing. Held by public collections in France since 1914, it has been at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris since 1983.
The painting depicts a domestic scene of a woman, sitting on a plain towel or sheet over a dark rug on the bare floorboards. She is largely undressed, with bare back, arms and head, hair tied back, and bare right thigh visible. A swathe of plain fabric is wrapped around her waist, with a black boot or stocking on her right lower leg. Other clothing is draped over a chair to the left.
The work was painted in oils on cardboard, and measures . It employs a light colour palette, predominantly blues with yellowish greens and red for the woman's hair, thinned with turpentine to create a loose effect. The Impressionist image, similar to a work in pastels or a sketch, with an elevated viewpoint, shows some influence from similar works by Edgar Degas, including those exhibited at the 8th (and last) Impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1886.
In the background are two wickerwork chairs and a bathtub, suggesting the woman is undressing to bathe, or getting dressed after washing. The furniture, recognisable from contemporaneous photographs, suggests the work was painted at Toulouse-Lautrec's studio on the in Paris. It may have been made in one session, directly from life, with no studies. The model may be one of Toulouse-Lautrec's favourites, Carmen Gaudin (1866?–1920).
It was catalogued as "La toilette" and dated 1896 for some time, but recent research suggests it was painted several years earlier, in 1889. It was one of two works that Toulouse-Lautrec exhibited with Les XX ("The twenty", an avant-garde art group) in Brussels in 1890 under the title "Rousse" (red-head). In the catalogue, it was described as "a red-haired woman seated on the floor, seen from the back, nude".
The painting was donated to France by on his death in 1914. It was first displayed in the Musée du Luxembourg, then at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, and later at the Musée du Louvre. It was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1983.

Presidential Band of the Russian Federation

The Presidential Band of the Commandant's Office of the Moscow Kremlin of the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation (Russian:Президентский оркестр Службы коменданта Московского Кремля Федеральной службы охраны Российской Федерации) shortened to the Presidential Band of the Russian Federation (Russian:Президентский оркестр Российской Федерации) is a special military unit that is the official military band for the President of Russia. It is the main band that plays at official ceremonies and receptions for high-ranking officials that visit Russia, including heads of state, heads of government, and diplomatic delegations. Although it is not an official military unit, it is affiliated with the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia. Unlike the Special Exemplary Military Band of the Guard of Honor Battalion of Russia, which shares a similar role, the Presidential Band is the official band of the President of Russia and is based in the Kremlin.
History.
The Presidential Band of the Kremlin Regiment of Russia was established in September 1938, being originally named the Moscow Kremlin Commandant's Band, for many years assigned as the official band of the Soviet KGB at state events. On January 11, 1993, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the band to be renamed to its current title. The band plays at a large number of concerts, in Russia and abroad, performing at prestigious venues and major international festivals. Since autumn 2004, the band has taken part in the changing of the guard in the Kremlin, which was revived that year. In addition to its concert band, the band also includes a symphonic orchestra and a symphonic pops orchestra, making it possible to broaden the repertoire from classical and folk music to rock compositions.
The band cooperates with Russian and foreign celebrities, such as Iosif Kobzon and Ken Hensley. Currently, the repertoire of the band includes 16 ballet performances, including "Swan Lake, "The Nutcracker" and "Sleeping Beauty". The band has given more than 700 performances in the Grand Kremlin Palace, as well as foreign theaters such as, the Kennedy Center, Madison Square Garden, the Rome Opera, and the Friedrichstadt Palace.
Events.
The Presidential Band plays at various events that usually tailored to the Kremlin's ceremonial needs. It has performed on the following occasions in Russia and foreign countries.
The band was awarded the following accolades:

2018 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team

The 2018 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team represented the University of Minnesota in the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Golden Gophers played their home games at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota and competed in the West Division of the Big Ten Conference. They were led by second-year head coach P. J. Fleck.
Minnesota began the year by sweeping its non-conference slate against New Mexico State, Fresno State, and Miami (OH); but opened Big Ten Conference play with four straight losses. The team secured wins against Indiana and Purdue, and then secured bowl eligibility by defeating rival Wisconsin for the first time since 2003, and the first time on the road since 1994. The team finished the regular season tied for fifth in the Big Ten West Division with a conference record of 3–6. They were invited to the Quick Lane Bowl where they defeated Georgia Tech to end the year with an overall record of 7–6.
The team's starting quarterback was true freshman Zack Annexstad before he suffered an internal midsection injury in the game against Nebraska on October 20. He did not return for the rest of the season, and redshirt freshman Tanner Morgan took his place under center. Both Annexstad and Morgan finished with nine touchdowns on the year. The team's leading rusher was Mohamed Ibrahim, with 1,160 rushing yards; and the team's leading receiver was Tyler Johnson with 1,169 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns, which tied for the conference lead. Johnson was named first-team All-Big Ten by the media voters. Defensive lineman Carter Coughlin and linebacker Blake Cashman each finished with 15 tackles for loss and were both named second-team All-Big Ten.
Previous season.
The Golden Gophers finished the 2017 season 5–7, 2–7 in Big Ten play to finish in sixth place in the West Division.

Norinco LG5 / QLU-11

The QLU-11 or LG5 is a semi-automatic grenade launcher developed by Norinco and introduced in 2011. The launcher's designation "QLU" stands for "light weapon (Qīng Wŭqì) - grenade (Liúdàn) - sniper (Jūjī)" in Chinese military coding standard.
Description.
The LG5/QLU-11 can be equipped with a fire-control system with a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging capability, and a ballistic computer that gives it air burst capability. The QLU-11 was tested in combat against Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden by Chinese marines. 
The LG5/QLU-11 is designed for long-range use and so has been described as a "sniper" grenade launcher. 
Befitting that designation, it is said to have a very high accuracy of 3-round R100 accuracy of 1 meter at 600 meter range, meaning that with proper aiming the weapon can put three successive high-explosive rounds into a typical window or door. Its development was inspired by the American Barrett XM109 anti-materiel rifle, which fires 25 × 59 mm grenades, and its design is based on the Chinese HSARI LR2 .50 caliber anti-material rifle.
QLU-11 utilizes new Type 11 precision cartridge that derived from the DFJ-87 armor-piercing grenade. The weight is reduced from 217g to 200g due to lighter casing. Propellant takes larger percentage of the cartridge space, thus improving the velocity from 195m/s to 320 m/s. This modification greatly increases the recoil, which QLU-11 features advanced primer ignition (API) blowback to mitigate.
Variants.
There are two variants of the weapon, an export version and a domestic version:

Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young 1969–1970 Tours

Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, 1969 and 1970 concert tours were two separate tours that covered North America, and Europe, before the band broke up for the first time.
History.
First tour.
The first tour starting in 1969 and finishing with three dates in Europe in January 1970, was the first Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young tour. The tour was notable for performing at many of the era's major festivals including their second ever gig, a one-hour show at the Woodstock Festival in the early morning of August 18, 1969, which was a baptism by fire for the group. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, "This is the second time we've ever played in front of people, man. We're scared shitless." Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie "Woodstock," boosted the visibility of the quartet tremendously. Footage from two performances from the Big Sur Folk Festival (held on the grounds of the Esalen Institute on September 13–14, 1969) appears in the movie "Celebration at Big Sur". They also appeared at the violence-plagued Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969, alongside Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers and the headlining Rolling Stones. At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film "Gimme Shelter" (1970). During this tour they also appeared on the television show "This Is Tom Jones," performing "You Don't Have To Cry" and with Tom Jones, "Long Time Gone". They also appeared on the television show "The Music Scene" performing "Down By The River".
After a break for christmas they finished this tour with three dates in Europe, attending the Royal Albert Hall, was a who's who of British rock musicians including Paul McCartney, Donovan and Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.
During time off in the first tour and in between the two tours, the band recorded and released their second studio album and their first as the quartet with Neil Young on board, "Déjà Vu".
Second tour.
The 1970 tour got of to a rocky start, in consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 "because [he] suddenly decided he was an Apache witch doctor." He further opined that "[Reeves] freaked too much on the bass and no one could keep up because [he] did not play one rhythm the same… he could play bass imaginatively, but he has to be predictable as well," while "Greg also wanted to sing some of his songs on the CSN&amp;Y show, which I thought was ludicrous, only because the songs weren't great. We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player." He was replaced by Calvin "Fuzzy" Samuels, a homeless Jamaican musician recently discovered by Stills at Island Records' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and "Déjà Vu" sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the Denver Coliseum on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor would later assert that his dismissal stemmed from a flirtation with Young's first wife (Topanga Canyon restaurateur Susan Acevedo) amid renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer John Barbata (formerly of The Turtles) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings.
As the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills' alcohol and cocaine abuse and perceived megalomania, culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the Fillmore East when he was informed that Bob Dylan was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to fire Stills during a two-night stint at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre in July 1970. Following his reinstatement, the tour ended as scheduled in Bloomington, Minnesota on July 9, 1970; however, the group broke up immediately thereafter. Concert recordings from dates at the Fillmore East, and The Forum in June 1970 and at the Auditorium Theater in July 1970 were assembled by Nash, and produced the 1971 double album "4 Way Street", which topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they would continue to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members would not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.
Tour setlist.
A typical set list for the first tour included the following, although there were substitutions, variations and order switches throughout the tour.
Second tour.
A typical set list for the second included the following, although there were substitutions, variations and order switches throughout the tour. The tour always started off with an acoustic set, with "Suite Judy Blue" Eyes opening, then solo/duo sets from Crosby, Nash, Young, then Stills, the songs in the solo spots were continually changing. A ten-minute interval section was taken before the electric set began, opening with "Pre-Road Downs", and generally finishing with "Carry On". They would then return for "Woodstock" and/or an acoustic "Find The Cost Of Freedom" for the encore.
Extra dates.
These were extra dates, not part of the main tours, but before the 1974 reunion tour.

22 July Circle

The 22 July Circle (, ) is a traffic circle in Thailand. It's an intersection of Maitri Chit, Santiphap and Mittraphan roads in Pom Prap subdistrict, Pom Prap Sattru Phai district, Bangkok.
History.
22 July Circle was built on 24 January 1918 to commemorate the occasion of Thailand's participation in World War I, which was the royal intention of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), the king of Thailand at the time. Under his directives, the Ministry of Public Works of Siam constructed many roads in that area. King Vajiravudh also gave names to other roads nearby, such as Suea Pa or Phlapphla Chai roads. In the following reign of his brother, King Prajadhipok, the three roads branching from the 22 July Circle were intentionally named to stress Siam's participation in WWI on the side of the Allied powers: "Maitri Chit" means friendship, "Mittraphan" was intended to signified the Allied powers, and "Santiphap" means peace. 
The name "22 July" comes from the date Thailand declared war, which corresponds to 22 July 1917.
Characteristics.
At the center of the roundabout is a fountain with a small public park for people to rest. The surrounding area is home to many billboard or advertising board shophouses, including tire and car spare parts shops and many famous restaurants. It has also been known for years as another district of Bangkok's sex industry.
22 July Circle is considered one of the circuits in Bangkok's Chinatown like another roundabout, Odeon Circle on Yaowarat road. It is close to many important places such as Bangkok railway station (Hua Lamphong), Wat Phlapphla Chai, Wat Thepsirin, the Maitrichit Chinese Baptist Church, the first Protestant church in Thailand, and Wat Khanikaphon, including Poh Teck Tung Foundation's headquarters.
In addition, it was also a popular place to observe the total solar eclipse on 22 July 2009.

V906 Carinae

V906 Carinae, also known as Nova Carinae 2018, was a nova in the Milky Way galaxy which appeared in the constellation Carina, near the 5th magnitude star HD 92063. It was discovered on images taken on 20.32 March 2018 by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN] telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The ASAS-SN group assigned the name ASASSN-18fv to the object. The discovery image was saturated, allowing researchers to determine only that the object was brighter than apparent magnitude 10. An earlier image obtained by ASAS-SN on 26.32 March 2018 showed the nova was a magnitude ~10.4 object at that time, and the object was not detected on ASAS-SN images taken on 15.34 March 2018 and earlier.
V906 Carinae was featured in the Astronomy Picture of the Day on 25 March 2018.
Pre-discovery images of V906 Carinae were matched to a star of Gaia magnitude 20.1. On 21 March 2018, it had brightened to a Gaia magnitude 7.80 (visual magnitude 7.45), and to magnitude 6.62 later the same day. 
Also on 21 March 2018, long exposure spectrographic measurements of ASASSN-18fv, specifically in the 3800Å to 7300Å range, were captured using CCD imaging. Detailed analysis of the spectral data confirmed that ASASSN-18fv exhibited characteristics of a classical nova.
All novae are binary stars, with a "donor" star orbiting a white dwarf. The two stars are so close to each other that material is transferred from the donor to the white dwarf. In the case of V906 Carinae, data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite suggests that the binary system has an orbital period of either 1.641 hours or twice that value. The mass of the white dwarf has been estimated to be , and the donor is believed to be a dwarf of spectral type K or M and a mass of .
One of the stars monitored by the Bright-star Target Explorer (BRITE) nanosatellite constellation was HD 92063. V906 Carinae was close enough to that star to be serendipitously observed by BRITE. In the BRITE data, the nova's maximum brightness occurred on 14 April 2018. BRIGHT provided a measurement of the nova's brightness every 1.6 hours, allowing the fluctuations near the peak of the outburst to be seen clearly. There were eight post-maximum flares with amplitudes of a few tenths of a magnitude each of which lasted 1 to 3 days. These flares in the visible portion of the EM spectrum occurred at the same times that γ-ray flares were seen by Fermi-LAT. Because the γ-ray flares are believed to arise from shocks in the ejected material, their correlation with visible flares suggests that most of the visible light from the nova may be produced in shocks, rather than the nuclear burning on the white dwarf's surface.

Hearts Aflame (film)

Hearts Aflame is a 1923 American silent melodrama film directed by Reginald Barker and starring Frank Keenan, Anna Q. Nilsson, and Craig Ward. The son of a retired timber baron meets and falls in love with a Michigan woman who refuses to sell her land unless the buyer promises to replant to replace the trees that are to be cut down.
Plot.
As described in a film magazine, retired millionaire lumberman Luke Taylor (Keenan) sends his son John (Ward) to Michigan to salvage some logs. While John is there he meets Helen Foraker (Nilsson), who owns a vast amount of uncut timber but refuses to sell unless the purchaser consents to replant the trees. Her forests were left to her by her father who planted them and she seeks to carry out his wish. Jim Harris (Heck), an unscrupulous land dealer, tries to force her to sell the land without this provision. John wires his father to come. The old man insists on buying the land, but also refuses to replant any cuttings. Jim again attempts to get the property for himself and likewise is refused by Helen, so he bribes a half-wit into setting the forest afire. John discovers the fire and rushes to aid. He and Helen take a logging train engine and succeed in bring through some explosives. The men work all night and finally the ridge is blown up, saving half the forest. John then not only agrees to replant the forest, but also to lend Helen any amount of money she needs and gives the two lovers his blessing.
Production.
Production started in early July 1922.
On August 28, a stunt went terribly awry in the Kootenays, British Columbia. "A six acre plot of ground was soaked with 700 gallons of gasoline and set afire for a scene in which Miss Nilsson was to drive a locomotive through the flames." Nilsson was severely burned and required a week to recuperate. Craig Ward and cameraman Percy Hilburn, filming from "an asbestos cabinet built on the side of the locomotive", were also injured.
Preservation status.
"Hearts Aflame" is now a lost film.

The 2017–18 United States national rugby sevens team season included both the 2017–18 World Rugby Sevens Series and the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens. The season began badly. In the first tournament of the 2017–18 World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai, 2017 World Rugby Player of the Year Perry Baker suffered a concussion, and the United States team limped to a last place finish. The U.S. improved from that point on, reaching the semifinals of the Australia Sevens. The team then won the 2018 USA Sevens, the first time the U.S. won their home tournament, boosted in large part by Perry Baker, who led all scorers with 8 tries. Baker, along with forwards Ben Pinkelman and Danny Barrett all made the tournament Dream Team. Overall the team displayed inconsistent performances, reaching the Cup semifinals three times, but also failing to qualify for the cup quarterfinals three times. Despite the inconsistent play, the U.S. finished sixth overall.

Player statistics.
The following table shows the leading players for the U.S. after the 2017–18 Sevens Series season. Among all World Series, players, Isles ranked first in tries scored with 49, and Baker ranked fifth with 37. Ben Pinkelman ranked fourth in tackles with 124 and fourth in matches played with 58.

2018 USA Sevens.
The United States won the tournament by beating Argentina 28–0 in the final. This was the first time that the United States won its home tournament. USA's Perry Baker led the tournament with 8 tries and 11 breaks. Baker, Pinkelman, and Barrett were all named to the seven-man tournament Dream Team.
With the U.S. finishing out the game with a lineup that included Isles (wing), Baker (center), Williams (fly-half) and Aljiboori (forward), it is believed that this is the first time the U.S. has fielded a team where the majority of players are African-American.

List of UK top-five albums in 1956

The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical albums. "Melody Maker" magazine published the United Kingdom album charts for the first time in 1956. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 5 of the UK Albums Chart during 1956, as well as albums which peaked in 1957 but were in the top 5 in 1956. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 5 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).
Fifteen albums were in the top five this year. "High Society" credited to Various artists was released in 1956 but did not reach its peak until 1957. Two artists scored multiple entries in the top 5 in 1956 (excluding Various artists, who are all different performers under the same name). Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Lonnie Donegan and Mario Lanza are among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 5 album in 1956.
The first album to reach number-one in the United Kingdom was "Songs for Swingin' Lovers" by Frank Sinatra. Six different albums peaked at number-one in 1956, with albums credited to Various artists (3) having the most albums hit that position. 
Background.
Multiple entries.

Total West

Total West was a transport company in Western Australia.
History.
In 1981, Westrail sough expression of interest to handle small freight traffic. Total West commenced operating on 1 July 1982 as a joint venture between Mayne Nickless and Westrail, each owning 50%. It was formed to transport mail and less than wagon load traffic.
In 1985, Mayne Nickless sold its stake to Gascoyne Trading Company. Gascoyne's 50% stake was included in its sale to Wesfarmers in 1996, who purchased Westrail's stake later the same year.

Groove Grease

Groove Grease is an album by American jazz organist Jimmy McGriff featuring performances recorded in 1971 and released on the Groove Merchant label.
Reception.
Allmusic's Rob Theakston said: "This 1971 session finds McGriff continuing to do like so many other jazz musicians of the time: embrace and adapt to the emergence of funk and soul into mainstream music, and recontextualize it in a jazz arena. The results are an unsurprisingly delicious slice of jazz-funk made from the finest ingredients. ... While McGriff's adventurous side is slightly tamed, it's that willingness to improv and blend together as a cohesive unit that makes "Groove Grease" such a tasty statement that is consistently fresh with repeated listenings".

Metro C Line

The METRO C Line is a bus rapid transit line in Brooklyn Center and Minneapolis, Minnesota operated by Metro Transit. The line is part of Metro Transit's METRO network of light rail and bus rapid transit lines. The route operates from the Brooklyn Center Transit Center along Penn Avenue and Olson Memorial Highway, terminating in downtown Minneapolis. The route is analogous to the existing Route 19 and is projected to increase ridership on this corridor from 7,000 to 9,000 by 2030. Eventually, part of its route will shift south to Glenwood Avenue from Olson Memorial Highway.
The C Line, along with the similarly built A Line, features fewer stops and modern bus stops with "train-like" amenities, including distinct stations and off-board fare payment. Additionally, the C Line features the Twin Cities' first battery-electric buses, built by New Flyer of America. Construction on the C Line began in March 2018 and began revenue service on June 8, 2019. The week of November 25, 2019, the C Line surpassed one-million rides after only five months of operation. Average weekday ridership was 30% higher than Route 19 ridership before C Line construction. Average Saturday and Sunday ridership has increased 25% and 40%, respectively.
Route.
The northern terminus of the C Line is at Brooklyn Center Transit Center in Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center. Station facilities include an indoor waiting area, restrooms, bike racks, and ticket vending machines and Go-To card readers for off-board fare collection. Brooklyn Center Transit Center also has rapid chargers for battery-electric New Flyer buses, but as of October 15, 2019 electric buses have been pulled from service due to charging problems at their garage. From there, the C Line begins traveling southbound along Xerxes with one stop at 56th Avenue, adjacent to the former site of Brookdale Mall. The line then continues south on Brooklyn Boulevard with a station at 51st Avenue before entering the City of Minneapolis, where Brooklyn Boulevard changes to Osseo Road. An infill station at 47th Avenue will be constructed between 2023-2025. The C Line turns south onto Penn Avenue, splitting from the under construction Metro D Line, stopping the next block at 43rd Avenue. From there, the line stops every to serving North Minneapolis along Penn Avenue. At Olson Memorial Highway, the C Line turns east to head towards downtown Minneapolis with four station stops along the highway.
The route enters downtown along 7th Street, which splits into one-way pairs; 8th Street southbound and 7th Street northbound. Southbound, three BRT stations are currently open, at Ramp A/7th Street Transit Center and 8th Street at Nicollet Mall and at 3rd/4th Avenues. Stations on 8th Street at Hennepin and Park Avenues will fully open at a later date, with buses still stopping there on request. After the final stop at Park Avenue, buses continue to 11th Avenue where they layover and await the return trip northbound.
Heading northbound from downtown, the C Line begins its route at Park Avenue Station located under Hennepin County Medical Center and continues north on 7th Street. Stations are at 3rd/4th Avenues, Nicollet Mall, and Hennepin Avenue. These stations are Metro Transit's standard bus rapid transit stations with off-board fare collection, real-time information, and near-level boarding. After exiting downtown, the C Line follows the same route north to Brooklyn Center Transit Center.
6th Street operations.
Upon opening day, 8th Street in downtown Minneapolis was being reconstructed. As a result, southbound buses were detoured onto Glenwood Avenue until 6th Street where they turned right and continued with temporary stops at Hennepin Avenue, Nicollet Mall, 3rd Avenue, and Park Avenue. These temporary stops do not include real time information or fare-collection systems, and riders could not board C Line buses at these stops without a valid transfer. In July 2019, another temporary stop southbound was added in downtown Minneapolis at 7th Street on Glenwood Avenue, analogous and a short distance to the Ramp A/7th Street Transit Center.
Buses were permanently routed to 8th Street December 7, 2019.
Phase II Glenwood Avenue alignment.
The Bottineau LRT Extension of the METRO Blue Line was planned to run down Olson Memorial Highway between downtown Minneapolis and Penn Avenue. Under Phase II, at the start of light rail service the C Line would move from Olson Highway to Glenwood Avenue about a quarter mile south. The goal was to balance transit service across multiple corridors while retaining similar travel times. In 2016, it was identified that there would be four stations on Glenwood Avenue at Morgan, Lyndale, Royalston, and between Cedar Lake Road and Dupont Avenues. At Penn Avenue and Olson Highway, a new station would be constructed south of Olson on Penn, moving it from its temporary stop location on Olson.
As an interim service on Olson Memorial Highway, three stations (Penn, Humboldt, and Bryant) were not built as normal C Line stations. Shelters are standard Metro Transit shelters and there is no near-level boarding, however, concrete pads were constructed the entire length of a bus. Real time information is provided at these stations, but they lack the service's distinct pylon markers. These stations still have off-board fare collection vending machines and Go-To card readers. 
Negotiations with BNSF prevented the planned alignment from proceeding and the future, including the alignment, of the Bottineau Blue Line Extension is unclear. In August 2020, the Metropolitan Council announced that the Bottineau Blue Line Extension would be looking for an alternative route to Brooklyn Park. Following the decision, Metro Transit is advancing planning for the Phase II alignment to be completed before the original 2024 opening of the light rail service. Stations at Penn, Lyndale, and Royalston have been coordinated with other public works projects.
Additionally, in 2021 the Minnesota Legislature passed a bill that included $250,000 to analyze transit improvements from Medina, Minnesota to downtown Minneapolis, requiring options for bus rapid transit service to be included. Initially studied in 2015, the line would follow the C Line's alignment on Olson Memorial Highway out of downtown Minneapolis, advancing the goal of balancing transit service across multiple corridors.
Service.
The C Line runs every 10 minutes during daytime service on weekdays and weekends, with reduced frequencies of up to 30 minutes in the early morning and late evening. Route 19 was retained as 30-minute underlying bus service along the line. Select rush hour Route 19 trips are rerouted along Thomas Ave to serve areas previously served by terminal branches of Route 19. Five months after opening the route in October 2019, combined ridership for Route 19 and the C Line was roughly 8,300 weekday rides. Previously the corridor served 7,000 weekday rides with just Route 19. Ridership increased on weekdays by 30%, Saturdays by 25%, and Sundays by 40%, five months after opening.
Stations.
Station characteristics.
Stations on Metro Transit's bus rapid transit service are unique and have enhanced features to differentiate them from local bus stops. Station shelters follow a "kit-of-parts" design so they can be easily identified and used throughout the system. There are three different station sizes–small, medium, and large–and the size chosen depends on daily boardings and site context. Stations have lighted canopies, on-demand heating, security cameras and emergency telephones, benches, and bike parking. Pavement in boarding areas are treated with a darker shade of concrete to delineate them from the sidewalk. Ticket vending machines and Go-To card readers are located on platforms for off-board fare collection, speeding up the boarding process and reducing bus dwell time. Each station has a pylon marker that provides real-time bus arrival information and station identification. Illuminated signage at the top of the station blinks when a bus is one minute away. Curbs at stations have tactile warning strips and are raised from the road surface, facilitating near-level boarding to speed up and make boarding easier.
Penn, Humboldt, and Bryant stations on Olson Memorial Highway were designed to be temporary and use standard Metro Transit shelters, but still have real time information and off-board fare collection. It was planned to have the Blue Line extension operate on Olson Memorial Highway, and upon its opening would have shifted the C Line's route south to Glenwood Avenue, where permanent stations would be constructed. Upon opening, the five southbound stops on 6th Street in downtown Minneapolis were drop-off only until the route permanently moved to 8th Street when construction was complete. These stops had no features or amenities due to their temporary use.
Fleet.
The C Line has fourteen 60-foot articulated buses assigned to the route. Six buses are diesel XD60 models and eight are battery-electric XE60 models, the first electric articulated buses in Minnesota. These buses were manufactured by New Flyer Industries in Saint Cloud, Minnesota and have three doors and wider aisles for faster boarding. The fleet is also equipped with transit signal priority, Quantum wheelchair securement, free WiFi, and USB chargers. Each bus was given a unique name by communities along the corridor.
Due to issues with charging equipment at garages, all eight electric buses were temporarily removed from service in July 2019 and then again in October. Because of this, three Gillig BRTPlus buses ordered for the A Line were temporarily placed into service on the C Line from July 2019 through January 2020. The electric buses returned to service late-October the same year. 
Additionally, five New Flyer XD60 buses were retrofitted with their fareboxes and Go-To card readers removed and repainted into METRO branding to be used on the C Line and A Line as necessary.
History.
The Metropolitan Council, the metropolitan planning organization for the Twin Cities, completed a 2030 Transit Master Study for the region in 2008 which identified arterial bus network corridors and encouraged further study of arterial bus rapid transit projects. The council set the goal of doubling transit ridership by 2030 in their 2030 Transportation Policy Plan and identified implementing arterial bus rapid transit as a method of increasing ridership. Metro Transit began study of 11 corridors for their potential for arterial bus rapid transit in 2011–2012. Those 11 routes served 90,000 riders per weekday, which was close to half of the total ridership for urban routes. Ridership on implemented routes was predicted to increase 20 to 30 percent after the first year of opening. Corridors were evaluated on capital and operating costs, potential ridership, and travel time savings. At the time, an opening for the first BRT line was hoped to open in 2014. The Penn Avenue corridor was not selected in this initial evaluation of 11 corridors in 2011-2012 because planning for the Bottineau LRT proposed Penn Avenue as possible alignment but an addendum to the study released in January 2013 added the Penn Avenue corridor as well as extended the Chicago Ave corridor to become what is now the D Line project. Both the Penn Avenue corridor and the future D Line corridor were selected as the next two priorities behind the A Line and the Riverview Corridor, which was then named the B Line.
The A Line was selected as the first corridor for implementation in 2012, with the line opening in 2016. After the B Line project was postponed so the corridor could undergo further study as the Riverview Corridor, the C Line was selected as the region's second arterial bus rapid transit project in 2014. At the time Metro Transit believed construction could begin in 2016. The corridor already had strong transit usage with buses making up 2% of vehicle traffic on Penn Avenue but carrying 26% of people. There were however limited bus shelters or benches despite Route 19 carrying 7,000 daily riders.
On June 28, 2021, it was announced that an infill station, Osseo &amp; 47th Avenue, would be built as part of Hennepin County's reconstruction of Osseo Road. The station would also be used by the Metro D Line. The original C Line plan included a station at Victory Memorial Parkway, later expanding the scope to 47th Avenue, but was shelved due to low ridership, physical restraints, and opposition from the Minneapolis Park Board. The removal of the station resulted in an uncharacteristically long gap between 43rd Avenue and 51st Avenue stations, in addition to rail yards creating a physical barrier to the north. The infill became planned because feedback received during the planning of both the C Line and D Line warranted inclusion of a new station. The station will be constructed with the roadway project beginning in 2023. Later 2021 an amendment will be released for the station plan.

University of Saskatchewan Graduate Students' Association

The University of Saskatchewan Graduate Students' Association ("GSA-uSask" or "UofS-GSA") is the university-wide representative body for graduate students at the University of Saskatchewan, located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was established in 1985 as an office inside the University of Saskatchewan Students' Union (USSU), but it became an independent body only in 1992. Its head office is located at 1337 College Drive in the Emmanuel and St. Chad. The College of Emmanuel and St. Chad was designed by Webster, Forrester and Scott of Saskatoon and constructed in 1965 and 1966.
History.
In 1883 by an Act of Parliament, Emmanuel College was incorporated as “The University of Saskatchewan.” 
In 1984-85, it was created inside the USSU (University of Saskatchewan Students' Union) a group to handle issues specifically related to graduate students in the University of Saskatchewan.
In 1992, this group became an independent body, called University of Saskatchewan Graduate Students' Association. The GSA-uSask is a not-for-profit student organization that provides services, events, student clubs and advocacy work to the graduate students of University of Saskatchewan.
In the fall of 2006, the Emmanuel and St. Chad space earmarked for GSA-uSask.
Since 2016-17, the GSA is pleading for a seat on the U of S Board of Governors. The Board is responsible for overseeing matters on management, administration and control of the university's property and financial affairs. Currently, the U of S is the only university in the U15 group that doesn't have a seat for graduate students on the Board. Although changes on the composition of the Board depends on University of Saskatchewan Act's amendments (within the scope of the Provincial Legislature), recent support by the University Council is an indication that not only the graduate students consider this an important cause. In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the GSA and the PSAC Local 40004 — which represents U of S graduate students who work as teaching, research and student assistants — created a petition to oppose the tuition increase proposed by the U of S. Another increase to the differential rate of 14.6%, from 1.58 to 1.81, will affect more the international student. The projected tuition for this group will rise from $2,243 to $2,698.71 — a difference of about 20%.
GSA Commons.
Since 2007, Emmanuel and St. Chad Chapel holds the GSA-uSask headquarters, also referred as GSA Commons. The chapel was de-consecrated by a multi-faith opening ceremony.
Governance.
The governance of the University of Saskatchewan Graduate Students' Association is share among three bodies: the "executive committee"; the "Council"; and the "Board of Directors".
Student Clubs.
The student clubs in the University of Saskatchewan may be ratified by the USSU and/or ratified by the GSA.
Among the several "student clubs" in this University, there are those related to cultural backgrounds (students from other countries), professional associations, sustainability groups, religious studies, sports and many more.

Beautiful Darkness (graphic novel)

Beautiful Darkness () is a graphic novel illustrated by French illustrators Marie Pommepuy and Sébastien Cosset, whose names combine to form their pen name Kerascoët.
In the story, people the size of fruit flies are expelled from their home and thrust outside into the woods. The novel tells the tale of Aurora, a sweet girl who finds herself taking a leadership role in the community of tiny people. The story starts out with a whimsical tone but rapidly devolves into a morbid narrative. Although much of the plot revolves around Aurora, small segments of the story focus on side characters who serve to emphasize the contrast between the daunting situation at hand and the playful way characters interact.
Plot.
The protagonist Aurora is on a date with Prince Hector when they are suddenly expelled from their home, which happens to be the corpse of a young human girl. Everyone else living in the corpse is forced out as well, leaving them to figure out how to survive in the woods. Aurora takes leadership and begins helping everyone she can by gathering food and providing company. She befriends the narcissistic Zelie, who has a group of loyal followers that worship and spoil her.
Aurora's naivety makes her blind to the fact that she is a victim of Zelie's manipulation. Hector, who was seemingly infatuated with Aurora, marries Zelie unexpectedly and Aurora is left alone. Her closest friends become part of Zelie's following. The betrayal strips Aurora of her sympathy and purity; her only goal from then on is to survive, no matter what the cost.
Aurora comes across a giant's cabin, where she can live without the others. Eventually, Zelie and her posse discover this cabin as well and make themselves at home. Aurora desperately wants them out of her new home, so she tricks them into gathering under a stove and watches as the giant unknowingly burns them alive. Finally, she can live in peace.
Awards.
It received a nomination for an Eisner Award in 2015.
Critical reception.
A starred review on "Publisher's Weekly" says the novel is always on readers' minds and "unforgettable". An exclusive preview of the book on "Nerdist" calls the novel "a sinister saga that you won't be able to put down."
Publication.
The story was written by Pommepuy and Fabien Vehlmann. "Beautiful Darkness" was first published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in 2009 and translated by Helge Dascher.

On June 25, 2019, "The New York Times Magazine" listed Leroy Pullins among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.
Charts.
"I'm a Nut" reached number 18 on the U.S. "Billboard" Country chart. It also crossed over to the pop charts of the U.S. and Canada, peaking at number 57 on the U.S. Hot 100 and number 71 on the Canadian "RPM".
Actualization of views.
"I'm a Nut" has more than one million views on a single YouTube posting as of March 25, 2018. The post, however, misattributes the song to Roger Miller.

Lord Nelson (1800 ship)

Lord Nelson was launched in Spain in 1792 under another name. She came into British hands as a prize in 1800. She was initially a merchantman but then made two voyages as a slave ship carrying slaves from West Africa to the West Indies. In 1804 she had an inconclusive single-ship action with a French privateer. A French privateer finally captured her in May 1806 on her third slave trading voyage before she had disembarked her slaves.
Career.
"Lord Nelson" first appeared in the "Register of Shipping" only in 1802. Her master was Sanderson, changing to M'Kinnis, her owner was Hankinson, and her trade was Liverpool–Leghorn, changing to Liverpool–Africa. 
Slave trading voyage #1 (1802-1803): Captain John Maginnis sailed from Liverpool on 3 September 1802, Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. The voyage began during the Peace of Amiens so he did not acquire a letter of marque. "Lord Nelson" gathered her slaves at New Calabar and arrived at Havana on 16 May 1803. She had embarked 287 slaves and she landed 258, for a loss rate of 33%. She left Havana on 27 July and arrived at Liverpool on 14 September. She had left Liverpool with 30 crew members and she suffered 10 crew deaths on the voyage.
Slave trading voyage #2 (1804-1805): Captain John Maginnis acquired a letter of marque on 17 January 1804. "Lord Nelson" sailed from Liverpool on 15 March 1804. She gathered her slaves in Africa and arrived at St Thomas on 6 October 1810. She had embarked 352 slaves and she landed 316, for a loss rate of 10.2%.
On 26 December 1804, "Lord Nelson", "Nymphe", Captain Heinsen, of 10 guns, and "Harmony", Captain Reed, of 20 guns, sailed from St Thomas's together for mutual protection, bound for Liverpool. A few hours after they had left port they encountered a French privateer schooner of 10 guns (two of them 12-pounders), and 100 men, the entire crew from the captain on down being black.
Maginnis, seeing the privateer attempting to catch "Nymphe", stopped to give her time to catch up. However, the privateer captured "Nymphe" before she could reach "Lord Nelson". "Harmony" took the opportunity to escape. Maginnis then set sail again, with the privateer in pursuit. The pursuit continued through the night and into the next day, with the privateer finally catching up at 3pm. An engagement ensued that lasted for an hour and a half with the privateer several times unsuccessfully trying to come up and board. Eventually the privateer sailed way, her sails and rigging much damaged and her bulwarks entirely gone."Lloyd's List]" №4190.]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Lord Nelson" arrived at Liverpool on 5 February 1805. She had left with 39 crew members and she suffered 6 crew deaths on the voyage.
Slave trading voyage #3 (1803-1804): Captain Robert Martin acquired a letter of marque on 11 October 1805. He sailed from Liverpool on 2 November 1805, bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands.
Fate.
The privateer "Prince of Peace" (probably Spanish "Principe de Paz"), of twelve 12-pounder guns and 160 men captured "Lord Nelson" at as "Lord Nelson" was sailing from Africa to Saint Lucia. She arrived at Cayenne around 5 May.

Diuris micrantha

Diuris micrantha, commonly called the dwarf bee orchid or tiny bee orchid, is a rare species of orchid which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has four to six linear leaves at its base and up to six yellow flowers with reddish brown markings. It grows in swampy places south of Perth.
Description.
"Diuris micrantha" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and six linear leaves, each leaf long and wide in a loose tuft at the base. Up to six yellow flowers with reddish brown markings, about long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal curves upwards and is narrow egg-shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear, green and purplish, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect, spread apart from each other with a broadly egg-shaped to almost round blade long and wide on a reddish-brown stalk long. There is a distinct reddish brown blotch near the tip of the petals. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped to wedge-shaped, wide and the side lobes are linear to egg-shaped, long and about wide. There are two parallel, reddish brown, ridge-like calli about long near the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris micrantha" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in Mandogalup, and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet ("micrantha") is derived from the Ancient Greek words "mikros" meaning "small" or "little" and "anthos" meaning "flower", referring to the small flowers of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The dwarf bee orchid grows with dense sedges in swampy place between Perth and Boyup Brook in the Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Diuris micrantha" is classified as "vulnerable" under the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" and as "Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). It is threatened by weeds and by inappropriate fire regimes, especially by fires in winter and spring.

List of PSLV launches

This is a list of launches made by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rockets.
Notable missions.
PSLV flight D1.
This was the first developmental flight of the PSLV-D1. The IRS-1E satellite which was proposed to be launched was derived from the engineering model of IRS-1A incorporating a similar camera and an additional German-built monocular electro-optical stereo scanner. Even though the mission was a failure, the launch team and an expert committee appointed thereafter noted that the mission had validated many technologies and that most sub-systems had performed optimally.
PSLV flight C2.
In the flight sequence, IRS-P4 was injected first, followed by KITSAT-3 and DLR-Tubsat in that order. The mission was supported by ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network of ground stations located at Bangalore, Sriharikota, Lucknow, Mauritius, Bearslake, Russia and Biak, Indonesia. During the initial phase of the mission the ground station at Wilhem in Germany also provided network support. Upon injection of the satellites, data from the IRS-P4 was received at Hyderabad while KITSAT-3 data was received at the ground station in South Korea and the data from the DLR-Tubsat was received at the university ground station in Berlin.
PSLV flight C6.
The former President, Dr. Abdul Kalam, witnessed the launch from the Mission Control Centre. It was the first PSLV launch from second pad, using integrate-transfer-and-launch technology. After its integration in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the PSLV-C6 was transported on rails to the Umbilical Tower (UT) located one km away using the Mobile Launch Pedestal where the final operations were carried out.
PSLV flight C7.
The following hardware changes were made since PSLV-C6:
PSLV flight C9.
The fourth stage first fired Cartosat-2A into orbit at an altitude of 637 km about 885 seconds after lift-off. About 45 seconds later, it propelled IMS-1 into the orbit. Then the six nano satellites belonging to a cluster called Nanosatellite Launch System-4 (NLS-4) were injected into orbit at intervals of 20 seconds each. NLS-5, a single satellite, flew out and finally the tenth satellite Rubin-8 went along with the fourth stage into orbit. Two satellites belonged to India and the remaining were nanosatellites built by universities in different countries. This was the maximum number of satellites placed in orbit, in a single PSLV launch.
PSLV flight C21.
Launch attended by the former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh. mRESINS (mini Redundant Strapdown Inertial Navigation System) bolted to the vehicle's fourth stage, have tested avionics for future PSLV missions. With this launch Indian Space Research Organisation marked its 100 space missions, with 62 satellites, 37 launch vehicles and 1 Space Capsule Recovery Experiment.
PSLV flight C22.
Earlier launch date for PSLV C22 was fixed as 12 June 2013 but the launch had been postponed because of a technical snag in the 2nd stage.
ISRO then replaced a faulty component in the PSLV C22 rocket and rescheduled the flight of the IRNSS-1A satellite on 1 July 2013. PSLV C22, successfully launched IRNSS-1A, the first satellite in the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS). At the completion of the countdown, PSLV C22 lifted off from the First Launch Pad at 23:41 (IST) on 1 July 2013 with the ignition of the first stage and four strap-on motors of the launch vehicle.
PSLV flight C25.
The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), informally called "Mangalyaan" is a Mars orbiter that was successfully injected into Earth orbit on 5 November 2013 at 14:38 IST (09:08 UTC) atop a PSLV-XL launch vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota (SHAR).
PSLV flight C29.
PSLV C29 lifted off from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of SDSC SHAR at 18:00 [IST] on 16 December 2015. It successfully deployed six satellites it carried with gross weight of 624 kg. After fourth stage engines were cut off primary payload TeLEOS-1 was injected in orbit at about 18 minutes 12 seconds after lift-off. This was followed by the deployment of other five satellites, namely Kent Ridge-1, VELOX-C1, VELOX-II, Galassia and Athenoxat-1 in quick succession in the subsequent three minutes. 67 minutes into flight fourth stage re-ignition capability was demonstrated successfully by firing its engines for duration of nearly five seconds. This capability would enable multiple satellite deployment in varying orbits on same flight.
PSLV flight C34.
PSLV-C34 was launched on 22 June 2016 and successfully deployed 20 satellites in sun-synchronous orbit. A Dual Launch Adapter with new design compared to its previous version was used to integrate all ride-sharing payloads with PS4. After completion of mission a pair of PS4 re-ignition tests were performed to reaffirm multi-orbit deployment capability of PS4. A new inertial navigation system 'Mk IV A' employing next generation accelerometer was introduced on this mission.
PSLV flight C36.
Remote umbilical fill and drain system was used on fourth stage for the first time reducing the countdown time by one day. Experimental avionics packages were flown bolted to fourth stage including "miniaturized advanced inertial navigation system" miniAINS, NavIC based positioning system, Vikram processor and new lithium-ion based power system. A video imaging system was also on-board, consisting of five cameras which captured and live streamed various staging events.
PSLV flight C37.
PSLV C37 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota (SHAR) carrying a payload of 104 satellites from 6 countries around the world (Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United States). Of the 104 satellites, 96 were CubeSats made by Planet Labs and Spire Global, two San Francisco companies adding to their commercial satellite constellations.
The launch set the record for the largest number of spacecraft ever launched on a single rocket. The previous record was held by Russia, which in 2014 catapulted 37 satellites in a single launch, using a modified Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It was again broken by SpaceX on their Transporter-1 mission which carried 143 satellites on a single launch.
PSLV flight C48.
This was the 50th flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It was also the 75th launch from Sriharikota. The flight placed into orbit the RISAT-2BR1 and nine customer satellites for New Space India Ltd. It was the second flight of the PSLV in the QL configuration.
PSLV flight C51.
This was the 53rd flight of PSLV and the 50th successful flight of PSLV. This is the first dedicated commercial launch executed by NSIL. The mission successfully placed Amazônia-1 from Brazil, INPE and 18 other payload into its orbit.
Launch failures.
IRS-1E.
On 20 September 1993, a PSLV D1, the first developmental flight rocket, failed during launch of IRS-1E. A significant attitude disturbance occurred during second to third-stage separation, causing the attitude control command to exceed its maximum value. Because of the programming error in the pitch control loop of the digital autopilot software in the guidance and control processor, the required reversal of command polarity did not take place, causing the pitch loop to become unstable, resulted in loss of attitude control and failure to achieve orbit. The attitude control disturbance was traced to failure of one of the retro rockets designed to pull the burnt second stage away from the third stage. The vehicle crashed into the Bay of Bengal 700 seconds after take off.
IRS-1D.
On 29 September 1997, a PSLV C1 rocket failed during launch of IRS-1D. Anomalous interaction between the primary and secondary pressure regulators of the fourth stage caused a reduction in propellant flow and thrust after 250 seconds of burn time. As a result, the fourth stage was shut down by a software override timer after burning 435 seconds, before reaching the target orbit or depleting propellant. The injection velocity was 140 m/s low, resulting in an orbit of 301 x 823 km instead of the planned 817 km circular SSO. Initially, a leak of helium gas from one of the components in the fourth stage was suspected, similar to recent Long March 3 launch failure, but later ruled out. Resulting orbit was partially corrected using satellite's on-board thrusters, thereby raising the perigee to 737 km, while the apogee remained at 821 km.
IRNSS-1H.
PSLV-C39 carrying IRNSS-1H was launched on 31 August 2017 at 13:30 UTC from Second Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR). After about 203 seconds of flight payload fairing failed to be jettisoned as planned. Despite completing rest of the flight with all other systems working as expected, with about 1000 kg of extra weight orbit achieved was 167.4 x 6554.8 km at 19.18° inclination well below the intended 284 x 20650 km at 19.2° inclination. After fourth stage engine cut off IRNSS-1H separation occurred, leaving it adrift inside the closed payload fairing. This was second event of total failure in PSLV launch history since 1993.
Launch history.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt; the PSLV has made 53 launches, with 50 successfully reaching their planned orbits, two outright failures and one partial failure, yielding a success rate of (or including the partial failure). All launches have occurred from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, known before 2002 as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

History.
McCarren Park.
McCarren Pool is a swimming pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that opened in 1936. In 1984 the pool was closed due to lack of funding and racial tensions. In 2004 choreographer Noémie Lafrance requested permission from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to use the derelict pool as a performance space. Lafrance chose the space as she resided nearby and wanted "this space for community use for other performances and for it to be used as an experimental space where people can develop site-specific ideas." Lafrance was able get to permission by raising funds and a donation of $200,000 from Live Nation but controversy arose as Lafrance and community activists objected to Live Nation's plans for paid concerts using the public space for private profit.
2006–2007.
In response to the controversy the Parks Department permitted a series of free performances. On July 9, 2006 music promoter JellyNYC got involved through Lafrance and hosted Les Savy Fav for a free concert on a makeshift stage to a crowd of 3,000 people. It soon became considered one of the best music series in New York City for its good sight lines and ability to hold 5,500 people. In addition to the music, drinks, and food the Pool Parties activities included dodgeball, Slip 'N Slides, and hula hooping.
2008.
In 2008 the Open Space Alliance for North Brooklyn won a bid to host concerts from the Parks Department and contracted with JellyNYC as they had produced the Pool Parties for two summers. The cost of the 2008 season grew to $750,000 to cover the free shows that was largely covered by corporate sponsorship. After the first summer of their collaboration the Pool Parties had to either end or find a new space as New York City decided to restore the space back to a functional swimming pool which would prevent future summer concerts. The final free show at McCarren was on August 24, 2008 where members of Yo La Tengo symbolically poured five one-gallon jugs of water from the stage into the pool.
2009.
For the 2009 season the Pool Parties were moved to East River Park, which at the time was a slab of asphalt and grass along the East River next to luxury condominiums. The move brought many challenges to the Pool Parties. JellyNYC stated that the move meant a doubling of their site fees, along with the loss of revenue from beer sales and increased security demands that made the concerts much harder to produce profitably. The economic climate made it more difficult to get enough corporate sponsorships to keep the concert series free. The Slip 'N Slides were replaced with children's wading pools for safety reasons but were eventually also prohibited as there were no lifeguards on duty. The site was administered by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation that had greater restrictions than the City Parks Department and were hesitant to renew the contract for 2010 until Sen. Chuck Schumer advocated for their continuation. The State Parks Department were concerned about security and safety violations including a partial stage collapse during a Girl Talk set.
2010.
In the second season at East River State Park the Open Space Alliance and JellyNYC engaged in a public dispute over $31,000 that threatened to cancel the August 29, 2010 show featuring Delorean and Dominique Young Unique that was resolved by donations from local property owners to the Alliance. The deterioration of the relationship was reported to be because of money, differences of opinion in event management, band choices and weaker attendance after the move. For the final show on August 29 there was a series of special guests including Big Freedia, The Cool Kids, Doug E. Fresh, Andrew W.K., D.M.C., Gucci Mane, and the lead singer from the inaugural concert Tim Harrington.
2011.
In 2011, JellyNYC tried a rebranded series of concerts in the spirit of the Pool Parties in various locations including Aviator Sports Complex and East Williamsburg but were unable to obtain the sponsorships or crowds to sustain them.

Lumines

 (pronounced as "Loo-min-ess") is a puzzle video game series developed by Q entertainment. The core objective of the games is to survive by rotating and aligning 2×2 blocks varying between two colors to form 2×2 squares of a single color which will be erased when the Time Line passes over them. The game is lost when the blocks reach the top of the playing field.
The series was initially conceived when Tetsuya Mizuguchi heard about the PlayStation Portable and wanted to develop a game for it. Since the original release, several sequels have been developed and released for multiple platforms including, PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, mobile phone, iOS, and Android.
The series has received many positive reviews and awards with the original receiving the highest review score ratings and the majority of the awards.
Gameplay.
"Lumines" is a block-dropping game that seems at first similar to "Columns" and "Tetris". The game is made up of a 16×10 grid playing field. A sequence of 2×2 blocks varying between two colors fall from the top of the playing field. When part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the remaining portion will split off and continue to fall. A vertical "Time Line" sweeps through the playing field from left to right. When a group of 2×2 blocks of the same color is created on the playing field, it creates a "colored square". When the Time Line passes through it, the colored square will disappear and points are added to the player's overall score. If the colored square is created in the middle of the Time Line, the Time Line will only take half of the colored square and no points will be awarded. Certain blocks with gems are known as "special blocks" and if are used to create colored squares, they will allow all individual adjacent blocks of the same color to be eliminate by the Time Line. In some games in the series, the special block is replaced with the "chain block", which connects to all adjacent blocks, regardless if a square is created.
The games feature background skins, which change the appearance of the visuals and blocks, and contain a different music track and sound effects. Skins are unlocked by progressing through the different game modes. Skins have different Time Line speeds, depending on the track's tempo. This can affect the gameplay; faster Time Lines make it more difficult to create large combos, and slower Time Lines may cause the playing field to fill while waiting for the Time Line to erase squares.
The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create colored squares. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing 3~4 squares (depending on the game) on consecutive Time Line sweeps. Score bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. Multiple colored squares of the same color can be shared between a single geometric shape. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will "share" itself with both the left and right halves and create two colored squares. The player loses when the blocks pile up to the top of the grid.
Development.
The series began with "". The game was the first game developed by Q Entertainment and was a launch title for the PlayStation Portable. The game was developed with an estimated amount of 4 or 5 people for over 1 year. Mizuguchi was inspired by the PSP when he first learned about the technology. He described the PlayStation Portable as an "interactive Walkman" and "Dream machine" due to the system being one of the few video game handheld consoles with a headphone jack, allowing the game to be played at any time, any location, and any style with good sound. After choosing the PSP as the next console to work with, Mizuguchi was inspired to make a puzzle game with music. Mizuguchi stated he wanted it to be an audio-visual puzzle game for the challenge, but he also wanted to make something that was less daunting to players compared to his previous titles "Rez" or "Space Channel 5", so that it would attract casual players. Originally, Mizuguchi wanted to make a "Tetris" game with music but due to various issues including licensing, it was not possible at the time and the concept of Lumines was used instead. His original hopes would eventually come to be when, in 2018, "Tetris Effect" was released for PS4. Lumines' subtitle "Puzzle Fusion" reflected that the game's music was essential to the game itself. Katsumi Yokota implemented strict rules for the series that the songs would follow time signature, with the exception of "Big Elpaso". This was due to the playing field being divided into 16 rows, and the Time Line needing to match the tempo of the music and in sync with the beat. By using time signature, it allows a total of sixteen eighth-notes to correspond to two bars precisely.
After the game was released, three titles were being developed simultaneously: "Lumines Plus", "Lumines II", and "Lumines Live!" for PlayStation 2, PSP, and Xbox 360 respectively. Tetsuya Mizuguchi wanted to achieve different things for each game. "Lumines Plus" was intended to be a direct port of the original "Lumines: Puzzle Fusion" with additional songs and skins. For "Lumines II", Mizuguchi emphasized he wanted the game to have its own original atmosphere and stylistic experience, different from the original. In addition, licensed songs from famous artists such as Gwen Stefani, Black Eyed Peas and The Chemical Brothers were incorporated into the game's soundtrack. Mizuguchi described "Lumines II" as a party and described himself as a party organizer to make the biggest party experience on the PSP. For "Lumines Live!", Mizuguchi developed the game with the concept of customizing music and choosing and downloading new songs. The goal of the game was to use everything that was happening during the time and make it available through DLC. Mizuguchi compared the game to a TV channel where they feed what the next thing will be.
Originally development of "Lumines: Puzzle Fusion", audio had to be completed before finalizing the skin's design. Yokota decided to do a different approach with "Lumines II" and "Lumines Live!". Instead, skin designs took priority in order to provide more concrete suggestions for the audio. Yokota stated this made greater variation possible for the music tracks.
Games.

Mukhtiyar

Mukhtiyar () was the position of head of executive of Kingdom of Nepal between 1806 and 1843. It was equivalent to Prime Minister of Nepal. There were 7 Mukhtiyars appointed between 1806 and 1843.
Meaning.
"Mukhtiyar" is formed from two words: "Mukhya" and "Akhtiyar". "Mukhya" means Chief and "Akhtiyar" means Authority. Altogether it means the "Executive Head of the State". Kumar Pradhan suggests that the word has Persian origin and denotes "competent-to-do" or broadly "Commander-in-Chief".
History.
In 1806, the self denounced King Rana Bahadur Shah was made "Mukhtiyar" (chief authority) and Bhimsen Thapa tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. On the night of 25 April 1806, Sher Bahadur Shah, step-brother of Mukhtiyar in desperation drew a sword and killed Rana Bahadur Shah before being cut down by nearby courtiers, Bam Shah and Bal Narsingh Kunwar, also allies of Bhimsen. It triggered the Bhandarkhal massacre on the royal garden. On the grounds of the chaotic situation of the Bhandarkhal massacre, Bhimsen rose to the title of "Mukhtiyar". The position of "Mukhtiyar" was under Pajani (Annual Renewal) system. During the annual muster of 1833, King Rajendra Bikram Shah delayed the retainment of Bhimsen's own position as the "Mukhtiyar". On the false charge of murder of infant Prince Devendra on 1837, Bhimsen, his brother Ranbir Singh, his nephew Mathbar Singh, their families, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay, and his deputy Bhajuman Baidya, with a few more of the nearest relatives of the Thapas were incarcerated, proclaimed outcasts, and their properties confiscated. Immediately after the incarceration of the Thapas, a new government with joint "Mukhtiyars" was formed with Ranganath Paudel as the head of civil administration, and Dalbhanjan Pande and Rana Jang Pande as joint heads of military administration. After about three months in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Rana Jang as "Mukhtiyar" and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole "Mukhtiyar". However, Ranganath Poudel, finding himself unsupported by the King, resigned from the "Mukhtiyari", which was then conferred on Pushkar Shah; but Puskhar Shah was only a nominal head, and the actual authority was bestowed on Ranajang Pande. At the beginning of 1839, Ranjang Pande was made the sole "Mukhtiyar". but Ranajang's inability to control the general lawlessness in the country forced him to resign from the office, which was then conferred on Puskar Shah, based on Senior Queen Samrajya Lakshmi's recommendation. There was also a brief army mutiny in June 1840. Brian Hodgson sent an indiscriminating report of mutiny to Governor General and he demanded the dissolution of the reigning government. Pushkar Shah and his Pande associates were dismissed by the King, and Fateh Jung Shah was appointed Mukhtiyar in November 1840. The Queen, seeking support of her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. He was greeted with a grand welcome and was offered to lead the government. By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed Prime Minister. Thus, the first "Mukhtiyar" to title himself as a prime minister, as per the British convention, was Mathabar Singh Thapa.

Power Trip (band)

Power Trip is an American crossover thrash band formed in Dallas, Texas, in 2008. By 2020, Power Trip's lineup consisted of Riley Gale (lead vocals), Blake Ibanez (lead guitar), Nick Stewart (rhythm guitar), Chris Whetzel (bass) and Chris Ulsh (drums); the latter replaced original drummer Marcus Johnson, who left in 2009. They have released two studio albums to date, "Manifest Decimation" (2013) and "Nightmare Logic" (2017), plus a compilation including their early tracks and a live album. 
Power Trip was one of the most successful thrash metal bands of the 2010s, with "Nightmare Logic" entering the "Billboard" charts, and receiving a number of accolades by publications. A live version of the song "Executioner’s Tax (Swing of the Axe)" received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.
History.
In 2013, the band signed with the Southern Lord Records label and released their first studio album, "Manifest Decimation". Their second album, "Nightmare Logic", was released in 2017 to critical acclaim. "The Guardian" mentioned that singer Riley Gale's lyrics on "Nightmare Logic", were about "social inequality and activism". He described "Nightmare Logic" as "dealing with this waking nightmare, things seem so surreal that they're unbelievable … trying to find optimism and a motivating force and realising that the 99% of us have more in common than we think". The success of "Nightmare Logic", as well as sharing the stage with the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, Anthrax, Exodus, Testament, D.R.I., Suicidal Tendencies, Napalm Death, Lamb of God, Hatebreed, Five Finger Death Punch, Opeth, Danzig and Obituary, helped Power Trip become one of the most popular thrash metal bands in the 2010s.
In 2018, the album "" was released as a way to compile their extra tracks. In late 2019, Power Trip announced that they were working on their third album.
Vocalist Riley Gale died on August 24, 2020, at the age of 34. His death was announced by the band the next day. In May 2021, it was reported that the official cause of death was ruled by the Dallas County's medical examiner as an accidental overdose from the "toxic effects" of fentanyl. The report also claimed that Gale, who reportedly had a history of depression and drug abuse, had been found "unresponsive on the floor at home" and the only other substance found in his system was marijuana.
At the time of Gale's death, Power Trip had already been scheduled to embark on a European tour with Lamb of God and Kreator, which was originally scheduled to take place in the spring of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic led to its postponement to late 2021. In a March 2021 interview with "Los Angeles Times", the surviving members of Power Trip stated that they are unsure of the band's future, but have not ruled out the possibility of continuing in Gale's memory. Lead guitarist Blake Ibanez commented, "We do want to continue to play music together; we just are not sure what that looks like at this time."
Musical style and influences.
Their sound has been described by critics as thrash metal and hardcore punk, as well as simply crossover thrash. Gale cited the importance of guitar riffs and pop songs: "Some of Blake [Ibanez]'s favorite bands are Killing Joke, Stone Roses, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Wipers". Gale said that he worked hard to do concise lyrics: "each word relates to the sentence, and how the sentence relates to the verse. Making sure everything's connected and there's not a syllable wasted." "I try to write something that's catchy that people can sing along to mindlessly". "[I write about] the frustrations with what I see. People's motivations". AllMusic wrote that their music reached fans of both "hardcore punk and extreme music".

The service was launched in Los Angeles, California during 2016 by actor Chuck McCarthy when he was in-between acting jobs and needed money. He initially advertised the business by posting fliers asking questions like “Need Motivation to walk”, “Scared to walk alone at night?”, “Don’t like walking alone at all?”, and “Don’t want people to see you walking alone and just assume you have no friends?”, which led to people contacting him to schedule walks. McCarthy describes the walks as “therapeutic” for both him and his clients. After receiving a large number of requests, McCarthy hired more walkers and began offering more locations.
Website.
On their website, the mission of The People Walker is further explained. They explain why they walk, why sitting is dangerous for the body, the physical benefits of walking, the mental benefits of walking, and the personal benefits of walking. The website also lists the profiles of the available walkers for hire, which includes a video of the walker introducing themselves.

Sabidia gens

The gens Sabidia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Sabidius" belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix "-idius". These typically formed from cognomina ending in "-idus", but the suffix was one of a number which came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was applied even in cases where there was no morphological justification. There is no evidence of a surname "Sabidus", but the name might be etymologically related to "Safini", an Oscan name for the Sabines and their descendants.

Tjoflot

Tjoflot is a village in the municipality of Ullensvang in Norway's Hardanger district, in Vestland county.
Tjoflot lies next to the sea on the Oksen Peninsula, with Hardanger Fjord in front of the village to the southwest and Mount Oksen () rising behind it. The village obtained a road connection in 1984.
The origin of the village name "Tjoflot", as the toponym is written today, is uncertain. Descendants from Ytrabødn (also known as Garen or Erlingsgarden), the main farm in the settlement, usually write their surname as "Tjoflot" or "Tjoflaat".
Genealogical records show that the toponym was previously spelled "Þiodaflar" in 1378, "Thiodhaflar" in 1427, "Tiodaaflaa" in 1463, "Tyofflo" in 1521, and "Thioflodt" in 1667. The locals say that "Tjod" (or "Þjod") means 'people' and that the name originates from the location of an old assembly site at a level area where such an assembly could be held.

Coradgery, New South Wales

Coradgery located at 32°48′54″S 148°00′04″ is a rural locality of Parkes Shire situated near the Bogan River, in New South Wales, Australia.
The first freehold land leases were granted in September 1848, the first four including Coradgery (the others being Coobang, Burrawang, and Gunningbland). By December 1849, the property was sought to be owned by gentlemen Bray and Palmer. It was given to be 20 030 acres and capable of hosting 750 head of cattle. By 1859, it was brothers George and John Palmer, who used as cattle brands an upside-down 'GP', and a '-B'. The cattle were 'store cattle' indicating the property was used for breeding and fattening before being sold for market. By 1874 however the property was stocked with 6000 sheep.
Later the property would be owned by the Balcombe family, principally Herbert Henty Balcombe (d. October 1941). Well known for its racehorse breeding, the property had a race track, trotting track and a polo field. Its picnic races often drew two-thousand people. Balcombe sold the property in 1920.
Balcombe and the property were mentioned by Scottish Border poet and Australian bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie in his 1897 poem "For the honor Old England, and the glory of the game (A history of international polo.)". The polo match included a captain of Australian commerce, (H)ugh Victor Foy, the poet himself, as well as Breaker Morant. The poem, given to be based on a true event, was written after Banjo Paterson's 1893 poem "The Geebung Polo Club".
At one time the area had the Coradgery and District Progress Association, a race club, and T. Farnsworth was the proprietor of the hotel. Gold had been discovered in the area by 1883. In 1906, a small goldfield was in operation.

Quadrax is a Slovak video game series of freeware games by Cauldron, commencing with "Quadrax" in 1995.
Production.
The debut game was one of the first commercially sold logic games distributed in Slovakia. It was a remake of the 1994 game created by programmers David Durčák and Marian Ferko for ZX Spectrum. The duo would found Cauldron the following year.
Despite the success of the first game, there wasn't an official sequel by Cauldron. In 1997 Alfaline would create an unofficial and unpublished sequel. Meanwhile, Quadrax III would become the first public successor in 2000. The fourth game was released in 2008.
Critical reception.
"Bonusweb.cz" felt that Quadrax belonged in the tradition of puzzle games alongside "The Humans" and "Lemmings". The site described 2006's "Faux pa" as a clone of this title. "Doupe.cz" thought the game was excellent.
"Bonusweb.cz" said Quadrax IV is a cool project and that it does not disappoint.
"Bonusweb.cz" said that Quadrax VIII is the most difficult game of all time.

Lizzie Throop

The Lizzy Throop was a two-masted wooden schooner, that transported general goods and later, timbers across the Great Lakes from 1849 until 1873, when she broke up in a gale on October 17, 1873. The wrecked hull of the "Lizzie Throop" was discovered in the summer of 2016, while searching for the lost airliner Northwest Airlines Flight 2501.
Vessel.
Built by J. O'Conner, in what was previously known as Mill Point, Michigan, the wooden vessel was crafted out of timbers milled from one of Grand Haven's earliest saw mills. The single deck schooner was constructed to a length of 86 feet (26 meters), a breadth of 21 feet (6.4 meters), with a depth of 8 feet (2.5 meters). She displaced 123 tons. The vessel had an almost 4:1 ratio in length and width, giving the ship an unusual wide appearance. She could be operated by a crew of 6 to 8 men. The ship's namesake comes from a derivative of the ship owner, Nathan Throop's deceased wife, Caroline Elizabeth Throop.
History on the Great Lakes.
The "Lizzie Throop" encountered some misfortunes on the lakes in her quarter century on the lakes. Two grounding events occurred in 1854. According to insurance claims, in April, 1854, she was driven against breakwater, near Chicago, Illinois. She ran aground again that same year, in November. In 1865, her tonnage was reduced to 97 tons and her cargo hold was outfitted to carry timbers, logged from Northern Michigan. Towards the end of her life, she ran regular routes from Muskegon to Chicago, carrying timbers to the rebuilding metropolis of the Midwest that was recovering from the Great Chicago Fire.
Loss.
On October 16, 1873, the "Throop" left Muskegon with a load of wood slabs at dusk. Around 11 P.M. she was encountered by a squall. At 3am her hull sprang a leak and started taking on water. The surviving first mate recounted his story "At 1pm, she filled with water up to her decks. At this time we were away from land about fifteen miles. At half past 6pm, she rolled over. The men took to the rigging except the mate, who steered her until she rolled over. Three of the men got into the boat, the Captain and cook having before this washed off and drowned. The three men, including the mate, left the boat and got into the hull and made a line fast to the boat and let her hang to the hull. The vessel began to break up and the three men were washed off of her. One was drowned, and the other two got ashore on a piece of the wreck."
The "Lizzie Throop's" deck separated from the hull, due to the buoyancy force of the wood slabs in the cargo hold, and the ship taking on water and beginning to sink. The wood slabs pushed up through the strained decking, sending the hull to the bottom of Lake Michigan. What remained of the decking washed ashore hours later, nearly nine miles north of Grand Haven, with 4 of the sailors aboard. Two sailors, being Captain Mcmara and the cook, went down with the "Throop".
Discovery of the wreck.
SideScan sonar expert Ralph Wilbanks, working with Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates, on behalf of Clive Cussler, while searching for a missing airliner that disappeared in 1950, was using side-scan sonar, when an image appeared of what looked like an early wooden sailing ship. The "Throop" was always believed to have all washed ashore, but the MSRA team discovered by studying the wreck's dimensions, that the image was indeed the hull of the "Lizzie Throop". The Wreck lies in 280 feet (85 meters) of water, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of South Haven. Wilbanks and his team also were responsible in locating the H.L. Hunley Confederate submarine.

3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage

"3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage" is the thirteenth episode of the twenty-ninth season of the American animated television series "The Simpsons", and the 631st episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on March 25, 2018. The title is a reference to the 1973 Swedish television miniseries "Scenes from a Marriage".
Plot.
After watching a superhero movie and on Bart and Lisa's insistent request while staying after the credits for several middle and post-credit sequences, the Simpson family returns home from Capital City. Homer and Marge start narrating the story of how they lived there before getting married, and as soon as they observe their old apartment, the couple invite the kids to visit it.
They meet the new engaged owners of the accommodation, who give Marge their mail. They continue to tell their story to the owners, explaining how Marge was a photographer working for a news company led by J.J. Gruff while Homer worked at a new company called Flashmouth. They often went partying, watching movies and watching the starry sky on top of a car, but after Bart was born, their careers and lifestyles went downhill. Homer lost his job and Marge was threatened by J.J. Gruff to be replaced by Booberella if Marge didn't get a new nightlife story.
Marge interviewed John Baldessari for an article, but Homer and Bart entered the gallery after Bart drove the car on a ferry while Homer was sleeping, and he started making pranks. When Marge presented to J.J. Gruff the photos of it, she lost her job because the journal lost their art advertisers thanks to Bart.
After Bart got banned from kindergarten class, they brought their problems to the Church. The solution that Reverend Lovejoy proposed via showing them a video called "Problem Child," which suggests that the solution to rambunctious children was to have a second child. Thus, Lisa was born.
What they demonstrate to the couple is too terrible that the soon-to-be-wife leaves the house, but the family, forcing smiles to show they are happy, bring her back.
In the final scene, the family returns to Springfield, while Lisa starts asking more stories of their background. They stop at the Doughy Dozen Bagels to eat some bagels. Homer and Marge are alone, but are disturbed by the kids moving around in the car while Grampa watches them.
Reception.
Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave this episode a B-, stating, "'3 Scenes Plus A Tag From A Marriage' might only be one of a handful the pair are credited with writing, but they’ve been on board "The Simpsons"’ ship for a long, long time. That familiarity works to pepper this episode with more than a handful of decent gags that stand on their own, regardless of whatever quibbling is left to be done over the show's timeline at this point. But it also carries a whiff of self-referential self-amusement that makes the episode feel inessential. Watching two old pros punch a clock makes for some solid laughs, but it's still not the place for groundbreaking Simpsons comedy."
"3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage" scored a 0.9 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.15 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

Always the Alibi ATA is an Indie Rock band based out of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Always the Alibi stole #1 on ReverbNation's Dallas Alternative chart in 2012 with EP "We Are Waiting" which was also named “EP of the Year,” by “The Music Enthusiast,” Jordan Buford. This was all before frontman Henry Coke's battle with brain cancer in 2013, which ultimately brought the band to a standstill.
After a complete and full recovery, ATA returned in 2016 ready to take back the time that was stolen. In recognition of Henry's time spent battling cancer, the subsequent release was named, “Reprieve,” and featured his very own radiation mask on the cover. With Grammy-nominated producer Chris “Frenchie” Smith at the helm, radio stations in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, such as 97.1 The Eagle, have had no problem picking up the most recent tunes.

Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal

In the 2010s, personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected without their consent by British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, predominantly to be used for political advertising.
The data was collected through an app called "This Is Your Digital Life", developed by data scientist Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research in 2013. The app consisted of a series of questions to build psychological profiles on users, and collected the personal data of the users’ Facebook friends via Facebook's Open Graph platform. The app harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook profiles. Cambridge Analytica used the data to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Cambridge Analytica was also widely accused of interfering with the Brexit referendum, although the official investigation recognised that the company was not involved "beyond some initial enquiries" and that "no significant breaches" took place.
Information about the data misuse was disclosed in 2018 by Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, in interviews with "The Guardian" and "The New York Times". In response, Facebook apologized for their role in the data harvesting and their CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress. In July 2019, it was announced that Facebook was to be fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission due to its privacy violations. In October 2019, Facebook agreed to pay a £500,000 fine to the UK Information Commissioner's Office for exposing the data of its users to a "serious risk of harm". In May 2018, Cambridge Analytica filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
Other advertising agencies have been implementing various forms of psychological targeting for years and Facebook had patented a similar technology in 2012. Nevertheless, Cambridge Analytica’s openness about their methods and the caliber of their clients — including the Trump and the UK’s Vote Leave campaign — brought the challenges of psychological targeting that scholars have been warning against to public awareness. The scandal sparked an increased public interest in privacy and social media's influence on politics. The online movement #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter. The Russo brothers are producing a film on the scandal, starring Paul Bettany.
Overview.
Aleksandr Kogan, a data scientist at the University of Cambridge, was hired by Cambridge Analytica, an offshoot of SCL Group, to develop an app called "This Is Your Digital Life" (sometimes stylized as "thisisyourdigitallife"). Cambridge Analytica then arranged an informed consent process for research in which several hundred thousand Facebook users would agree to complete a survey for payment that was only for academic use. However, Facebook allowed this app not only to collect personal information from survey respondents but also from respondents’ Facebook friends. In this way, Cambridge Analytica acquired data from millions of Facebook users.
The collection of personal data by Cambridge Analytica was first reported in December 2015 by Harry Davies, a journalist for "The Guardian". He reported that Cambridge Analytica was working for United States Senator Ted Cruz using data harvested from millions of people's Facebook accounts without their consent. Further reports followed in November 2016 by McKenzie Funk for the "New York Times Sunday Review", December 2016 by Hannes Grasseger and Mikael Krogerus for the Swiss publication "Das Magazin" (later translated and published by "Vice"), in February 2017 by Carole Cadwalladr for "The Guardian" (starting in February 2017), and in March 2017 by Mattathias Schwartz for "The Intercept". According to PolitiFact, in his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump paid Cambridge Analytica in September, October, and November for data on Americans and their political preferences. 
Information on the data breach came to a head in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistleblower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in "The Observer" by Cadwalladr, headlined "The Great British Brexit Robbery". Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in Channel 4 News in the UK and "The New York Times" due to legal threats against "The Guardian" and "The Observer" by Cambridge Analytica. Kogan's name change to Aleksandr Spectre, which resulted in the ominous "Dr. Spectre", added to the intrigue and popular appeal of the story.
"The Guardian" and "The New York Times" published articles simultaneously on March 17, 2018. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The negative public response to the media coverage eventually led to him agreeing to testify in front of the United States Congress. Meghan McCain drew an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign; PolitiFact, however, alleged that this data was not used in an unethical way, since Obama's campaign used this data to “have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends” rather than using this data for highly targeted digital ads on websites such as Facebook.
Data characteristics.
Numbers.
"Wired", "The New York Times", and "The Observer" reported that the data-set had included information on 50 million Facebook users. While Cambridge Analytica claimed it had only collected 30 million Facebook user profiles, Facebook later confirmed that it actually had data on potentially over 87 million users, with 70.6 million of those people from the United States. Facebook estimated that California was the most affected U.S. state, with 6.7 million impacted users, followed by Texas, with 5.6 million, and Florida, with 4.3 million. Data was collected on 87 million users while only 270,000 people downloaded the app.
Information.
Facebook sent a message to those users believed to be affected, saying the information likely included one's "public profile, page likes, birthday and current city". Some of the app's users gave the app permission to access their News Feed, timeline, and messages. The data was detailed enough for Cambridge Analytica to create psychographic profiles of the subjects of the data. The data also included the locations of each person. For a given political campaign, each profile's information suggested what type of advertisement would be most effective to persuade a particular person in a particular location for some political event.
Data use.
Ted Cruz campaign.
In 2016, American senator Ted Cruz hired Cambridge Analytica to aid his presidential campaign. The Federal Election Commission reported that Cruz paid the company $5.8 million in services. Although Cambridge Analytica was not well known at the time, this is when it started to create individual psychographic profiles. This data was then used to create tailored advertisements for each person to sway them into voting for Cruz.
Donald Trump campaign.
Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign used the harvested data to build psychographic profiles, determining users' personality traits based on their Facebook activity. The campaign team used this information as a micro-targeting technique, displaying customized messages about Trump to different US voters on various digital platforms. Ads were segmented into different categories, mainly based on whether individuals were Trump supporters or potential swing votes. As described by Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, the key was to identify those who might be enticed to vote for their client or be discouraged to vote for their opponent. Supporters of Trump received triumphant visuals of him, as well as information regarding polling stations. Swing voters were instead often shown images of Trump’s more notable supporters and negative graphics or ideas about his opponent, Hillary Clinton. For example, the collected data was specifically used by “Make America Number 1 Super PAC” to attack Clinton through constructed advertisements that accused Clinton of corruption as a way of propping up Trump as a better candidate for the presidency.
However, a former Cambridge Analytica employee claims that the use of the illicitly-obtained data by the Trump campaign has not been proven. Brittany Kaiser was asked "Is it absolutely proven that the Trump campaign relied on the data that had been illicitly obtained from Facebook?" She responded: "It has not been proven, because the difficult thing about proving a situation like that is that you need to do a forensic analysis of the database".
Potential usage.
Russia.
In 2018, the Parliament of the United Kingdom questioned SCL Group director Alexander Nix in a hearing about Cambridge Analytica's connections with Russian oil company, Lukoil. Nix stated he had no connections to the two companies despite concerns that the oil company was interested in how the company's data was used to target American voters. Cambridge Analytica had become a point of focus in politics since its involvement in Trump's campaign at this point. Democratic officials made it a point of emphasis for improved investigation over concerns of Russian ties with Cambridge Analytica. It was later confirmed by Christopher Wylie that Lukoil was interested in the company's data regarding political targeting.
Brexit.
Cambridge Analytica was allegedly hired as a consultant company for Leave.EU and the UK Independence Party during 2016, as an effort to convince people to support Brexit. These rumors were the result of the leaked internal emails that were sent between Cambridge Analytica firm and the British parliament. Brittany Kaiser declared that the datasets that Leave.EU utilize to create databases were provided by Cambridge Analytica. These datasets composed of the data obtained from Facebook were said to be work done as an initial job deliverable for them. Although Arron Banks, co-founder of Leave.EU, denied any involvement with the company, he later declared “When we said we’d hired Cambridge Analytica, maybe a better choice of words could have been deployed." The official investigation by the UK Information Commissioner found that Cambridge Analytica was not involved "beyond some initial enquiries" and the regulator did not identify any "significant breaches" of data protection legislation or privacy or marketing regulations "which met the threshold for formal regulatory action".
Responses.
Facebook and other companies.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first apologized for the situation with Cambridge Analytica on CNN, calling it an "issue", a "mistake" and a "breach of trust". He explained that he was responding to the Facebook community's concerns and that the company's initial focus on data portability had shifted to locking down data; he also reminded the platform's users of their right of access to personal data. Other Facebook officials argued against calling it a "data breach," arguing those who took the personality quiz originally consented to give away their information. Zuckerberg pledged to make changes and reforms in Facebook policy to prevent similar breaches. On March 25, 2018, Zuckerberg published a personal letter in various newspapers apologizing on behalf of Facebook. In April, Facebook decided to implement the EU's General Data Protection Regulation in all areas of operation and not just the EU.
In April 2018, Facebook established Social Science One as a response to the event. On April 25, 2018, Facebook released their first earnings report since the scandal was reported. Revenue fell since the last quarter, but this is usual as it followed the holiday season quote. The quarter revenue was the highest for a first quarter, and the second overall.
Amazon said that they suspended Cambridge Analytica from using their Amazon Web Services when they learned in 2015 that their service was collecting personal information. The Italian banking company UniCredit stopped advertising and marketing on Facebook in August 2018.
Governmental actions.
The governments of India and Brazil demanded that Cambridge Analytica report how anyone used data from the breach in political campaigning, and various regional governments in the United States have lawsuits in their court systems from citizens affected by the data breach.
In early July 2018, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office announced it intended to fine Facebook £500,000 ($663,000) over the data breach, this being the maximum fine allowed at the time of the breach, saying Facebook "contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information".
In March 2019, a court filing by the U.S. Attorney General for the District of Columbia alleged that Facebook knew of Cambridge Analytica's "improper data-gathering practices" months before they were first publicly reported in December 2015.
In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission voted to approve fining Facebook around $5 billion to finally settle the investigation into the data breach, with a 3–2 vote.
The record-breaking settlement was one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.
Again, in July 2019, Facebook has agreed to pay $100 million to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
for "misleading investors about the risks it faced from misuse of user data".
The SEC's complaint alleged that Facebook did not correct its existing disclosure for more than two years despite discovering the misuse of its users’ information in 2015.
Impact on Facebook users and investors.
Since April 2018, the first full month since the breaking of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, the number of likes, posts and shares on the site had decreased by almost 20%, and has decreased ever since, with the aforementioned activity only momentarily increasing during the summer and during the 2018 US midterm elections. Despite this, user growth of the site has increased in the period since increased media coverage, increasing by 1.8% during the final quarter of 2018.
On March 26, 2018, a little after a week after the story was initially published, Facebook stock fell by about 24%, equivalent to $134 billion. By May 10, Wall Street reported that the company recovered their losses.
#DeleteFacebook movement.
The public reacted to the data privacy breach by initiating the campaign #DeleteFacebook with the aim of starting a movement to boycott Facebook. The co-founder of WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, joined in on the movement by declaring it was time to delete the platform. The hashtag was tweeted almost 400,000 times on Twitter within a 30-day period after news of the data breach. 93% of the mentions of the hashtag actually appeared on Twitter, making it the main social media platform used to share the hashtag. However, a survey by investment firm Raymond James found that although approximately 84% of Facebook users were concerned about how the app used their data, about 48% of those surveyed claimed they wouldn't actually cut back on their usage of the social media network. Additionally, in 2018, Mark Zuckerberg commented that he didn't think the company had seen "a meaningful number of people act" on deleting Facebook.
An additional campaign and hashtag, #OwnYourData, was coined by Brittany Kaiser. The hashtag was created by Kaiser as a Facebook campaign that pushed for increased transparency on the platform. #OwnYourData was also used in Kaiser's petition for Facebook to alter their policies and give users increased power and control over their data, which she refers to as users’ assets and property. In addition to the hashtag, Kaiser also created the Own Your Data Foundation to promote increased digital intelligence education.
"The Great Hack".
The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal also received media coverage in the form of a 2019 Netflix documentary, "The Great Hack". This is the first feature-length media piece that ties together the various elements of the scandal through a narrative. The documentary provides information on the background information and events related to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the 2016 election that resulted in the overall data scandal. "The Great Hack" communicates the experiences and personal journeys of multiple individuals that were involved in the event in different ways and through different relationships. These individuals include David Carroll, Brittany Kaiser, and more. David Carroll is a New York professor in the field of media that attempted to navigate the legal system in order to discover what data Cambridge Analytica had in possession about him. Meanwhile, Brittany Kaiser is a former Cambridge Analytica employee that ultimately became a whistleblower for the data scandal.
Witness and expert testimony.
The United States Senate Judiciary Committee called witnesses to testify about the data breach and general data privacy. They held two hearings, one focusing on Facebook's role in the breach and privacy on social media, and the other on Cambridge Analytica's role and its impact in data privacy. The former was held on April 10, 2018, where Mark Zuckerberg testified and Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Dianne Feinstein gave statements. The latter occurred on May 16, 2018, where Professor Eitan Hersh, Dr. Mark Jamison, and Christopher Wylie testified, while Senators Grassley and Feinstein again made statements.
Mark Zuckerberg.
During his testimony before Congress on April 10, 2018, Zuckerberg said it was his personal mistake that he did not do enough to prevent Facebook from being used for harm. "That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections and hate speech". During the testimony, Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for the breach of private data: "It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here".
Zuckerberg said that in 2013 Aleksandr Kogan had created a personality quiz app, which was installed by 300,000 people. The app was then able to retrieve Facebook information, including that of the users' friends, and this was obtained by Kogan. It was not until 2015 that Zuckerberg learned that these users' information was shared by Kogan with Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was subsequently asked to remove all the data. It was later discovered by "The Guardian", "The New York Times" and Channel 4 that the data had in fact not been deleted.
Eitan Hersh.
In 2015, Professor Eitan Hersh published "Hacking the Electorate: How Campaigns Perceive Voters", which analyzed the databases used for campaigns between 2008 and 2014. On May 6, 2018, Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science at Tufts University testified before Congress as an expert on voter targeting.
Hersh claimed that the voter targeting by Cambridge Analytica did not excessively affect the outcome of the 2016 election because the techniques used by Cambridge Analytica were similar to those of presidential campaigns well before 2016. Further, he claimed that the correlation between user “likes” and personality traits were weak and thus the psychological profiling of users were also weak.
Mark Jamison.
Dr. Mark Jamison, the director and Gunter Professor of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida, testified before Congress on May 6, 2018 as an expert. Jamison reiterated that it was not unusual for presidential campaigns to use data like Facebook's data to profile voters; Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush also used models to micro-target voters. Jamison criticized Facebook for not being “clear and candid with its users” because the users were not aware of the extent that their data would be used. Jamison finished his testimony by saying that if the federal government were to regulate voter targeting to happen on sites like Facebook, it would harm the users of those sites because it would be too restrictive of those sites and would make things worse for regulators.
Christopher Wylie.
On May 16, 2018, Christopher Wylie, who is considered the “whistleblower” on Cambridge Analytica and also served as Cambridge Analytica's Director of Research in 2013 and 2014, also testified to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. He was considered a witness to both British and American authorities, and he claims he decided to whistle-blow to “protect democratic institutions from rogue actors and hostile foreign interference, as well as ensure the safety of Americans online.” He claimed that at Cambridge Analytica “anything goes” and that Cambridge Analytica was “a corrupting force in the world.” He detailed to Congress how Cambridge Analytica used Facebook's data to categorize people into groups based on political ideology. He also claimed that Eitan Hersh contradicted “copious amounts of peer-reviewed literature in top scientific journals, including the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Psychological Science, and Journal of Personality and Individual Differences” by saying that Facebook's categorizing of people were weak.
Christopher Wylie also testified about Russian contact with Cambridge Analytica and the campaign, voter disengagement, and his thoughts on Facebook's response.
Aftermath.
Following the downfall of Cambridge Analytica, a number of related companies have been established by people formerly affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, including Emerdata Limited and Auspex International. At first, Julian Wheatland, the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica and former director of many SCL-connected firms, stated that they did not plan on reestablishing the two companies. Instead, the directors and owners of Cambridge and its London-based parent SCL group strategically positioned themselves to be acquired in the face of bankruptcy procedures and lawsuits. While employees of both companies dispersed to successor firms, Cambridge and SCL were acquired by Emerdata Limited, a data processing company. Wheatland responded to news of this story and emphasized that Emerdata would not inherit SCL companies’ existing data or assets and that this information belongs to the administrators in charge of the SCL companies’ bankruptcy. David Carroll, an American professor who sued Cambridge, stated that Emerdata was aiming to conceal the scandals and minimize further criticism. Carroll's lawyers argued that Cambridge's court administrators were acting unlawfully by liquidating the company's assets prior to a full investigation being performed. While these administrators subjected SCL Group to criminal injury and a $26,000 fine, a U.K. court denied Carroll's lawsuit, allowing SCL to disintegrate without turning over his data.

Megamusical

A megamusical (also known as a "spectacle show", "blockbuster musical", or "extravaganza") is a large-scale musical produced for large commercial profit. Such musicals utilize spectacle and increased technology to "radicalize the imagistic potential of musical theatre." Early concepts of the megamusical came into existence in the 1970s, and the form was established and popularized in the 1980s by individuals such as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh. Megamusical is analogous to the film industry term "blockbuster".
Notable megamusicals include "Cats" (1981), "Les Misérables" (1985), "The Phantom of the Opera" (1986), "The Lion King" (1997), and "Wicked" (2003).
Characteristics.
Megamusicals are known for their grand scale. They tend to be set in the distant past and cover broad, universal issues (usually concerning social justice) that global audiences can relate to. Their plot is melodramatic, generally large in scope and lofty, but is not the focus of the show. Instead, a megamusical's priority is visual spectacle, with ample attention given to visual elements like extravagant set and costumes, complex and technologically advanced stagecraft, and large casts that allow for big ensemble numbers with elaborate choreography.
The scores for megamusicals are also grand, consisting of pop-influenced catchy songs, power ballads, lush harmonies and lavish orchestrations. Similar to operetta, this genre relies on the "continuous musicalization of dramatic action", and commonly feature a sung-through script in which the recitative is used to carry any dialogue in between musical numbers. As such, they are also referred to as "pop-operas".
Megamusicals have huge budgets and their non-artistic elements tend to be large as well. They are heavily publicized and the marketing for a megamusical is very intense and costly. Another key element of this form is its commercial appeal: whether or not the musical will be a hit at the box office. Generally, a megamusical is expected to be a massive financial success, but not necessarily a critical success.
A "big" Broadway musical is not necessarily a megamusical. One major difference between long-running Broadway productions such as "A Chorus Line" and "Chicago", and successful megamusicals is that the latter are global franchises. While musicals had long been an American institution, they gained unprecedented global recognition and success with the advent of megamusicals in the 1980s. Megamusicals are intended to be mass-reproduced worldwide and the successful ones run for decades in international markets. Once his musicals became famous and were being licensed all over the world, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber vowed to keep a very tight grip on them and would get final say on all productions regardless of the production team. This led to a strict level of standardization across the global productions of megamusicals that did not exist in live theatre before. This genre of musical theatre has thus been referred to as "McTheatre", alluding not only to the "ruthless cloning" of franchise productions, but also that its size and global reach is similar to that of the fast food chain giant, McDonald's.
A musical need not contain all of these elements to be regarded as a megamusical. Many of these features were established by the influential megamusicals of the 1980s, but the genre has since evolved. As such, consideration has to be given to the musical itself as well as the context surrounding it.
History.
Theatre historians and scholars often consider the megamusical genre to be a descendant of 19th century French opera, specifically operetta, because of their similar emphasis on spectacle. The concept musicals of the 1960s and 1970s, which prioritised visual representation over linear storytelling, are also seen as a precursor to this genre.
The megamusical phenomenon began with the 1981 musical "Cats", composed by Lloyd Webber and produced by Cameron Mackintosh. Theatre scholar Vagelis Siropoulos explained:
Musicologist Jessica Sternfeld points out that while "Cats" was the "first true megamusical", an early form of the genre was first introduced by "Jesus Christ Superstar", another musical by Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Tim Rice. Premiering on Broadway in 1971, some of the characteristics found in "Jesus Christ Superstar" later became key elements of the 1980s megamusical: a completely sung-through score replacing dialogue, expansive and complicated sets, and a melodramatic and larger-than-life plot. Lloyd Webber's 1978 musical "Evita" also featured these elements, leading Siropoulos to regard it as another early prototype of the genre — "not yet a megamusical in its finished form, like "Cats"".
The first two major players in the megamusical era were Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh, but soon after, they were joined by major corporations like Disney Theatrical Group, Viacom, PolyGram, and MCA. Disney Theatrical Group came onto the New York theatre scene in the form of megamusicals during the renovation of Times Square. To this day, they are one of the biggest producers of megamusicals on Broadway.
21st century.
After the September 11 attacks, Broadway ticket sales suffered. Ticket sales eventually started stabilising, driven not by tourists but by the locals. According to musicologist Elizabeth Wollman, New Yorkers sought escapist entertainment in the months and years following the attacks, and megamusicals fit that bill for them. Just a couple of years later came the megamusical "Wicked", which featured two female leads and had feminist undertones. Since then, other megamusicals such as "Hamilton" have incorporated elements of social change. "Hamilton" is a story about Alexander Hamilton and many other white men, but the cast deliberately featured mostly people of color in the lead roles and ensemble. There has been debate over whether or not "Hamilton" is a megamusical, but those who say that it is cite its commercial success, its design elements (though it features a simple set, it has grand lighting and stage automation) and the fact that it is completely sung-through.
Technology.
The megamusical's continual innovation of stage technology has transformed the live theatre experience. The advent of the genre itself was driven largely by major technological advances and globalisation, with one major turning point being the advancement of audio technology. While radio microphones had been used sparingly as early as the 1964 Broadway staging of "Funny Girl", the original 1981 production of "Cats" was the first known instance where an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. This departure from shared ambient microphones transformed sound design as it meant that musicals no longer had to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled megamusicals to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice of individually radio miking each performer has since become the norm in live theatre. Special effects technology also plays an integral role in this genre and has allowed for complicated set changes to be fully automated. Production manager Richard Bullimore was at the forefront of realising these technical advances along with companies such as Delstar Engineering, Stage Technologies and Unusual Rigging. 
Notable examples.

Boland 1911 Tailless Biplane

The Boland 1911 Tailless Biplane was an American pioneering aircraft.
At the end of 1909, Wilbur R. Kimball bought Dr. William Greene's 1909 biplane and took it to Rahway, New Jersey where he and Frank Boland removed the tail and began experimenting with a novel control system that eventually led to the first Boland Brothers 'jibbed' tailless biplane.
Design and development.
Frank Boland was convinced that a traditional tail rudder and ailerons/wing warping was unnecessary to provide lateral control for an airplane. He started experimenting with different control mechanisms in 1908. More enthusiastic and daring than skilled engineer, Boland and Kimball spent 1910 experimenting with, crashing and rebuilding the Greene biplane while they worked out and refined what Boland called the 'jibbed' control. 
The resulting airplane was very easy to fly. To go left or right, you would turn the wheel in the direction you wished to go and up and down was controlled by pushing and pulling on the control wheel. From a description of his flight in Mineola, Long Island in 1911: "There is no grandstand play about Boland's flying. He just gets in the machine and off he goes turning as he leaves the ground, if he likes, which no other aviator thinks of doing. He just imagines himself in an automobile and drives accordingly. He says he never bothers about lateral balance or other minor things like that."
Boland was very much into the adventure of discovery and flying. Appearance was of little concern to him. A quote from the same article describes the condition of his aircraft: "No attempt has been made to refine the machine, to have nicely finished woodwork, or neat sockets and turnbuckles.The cloth is rusty from the weather and has been on for about a year, part of the time no shed being provided for the machine at all—he just leaves it out like a lazy farmer would his plow. Some ribs have one curve, some another, sometimes they are flat, due to weather conditions. Out under the elevator hang four sash weights which some time in the past aided the housewife to raise her kitchen window. All Boland wants to do is fly and he doesn't care a hang for looks."
Wing Jib Control.
From Aeronautics magazine Nov. 1911 issue describing the operation of the wing jib control illustrated on the right:
"According to Mr. Boland, the operation of the machine is the same as that of an automobile, with the exception of the elevator which works in the accepted manner. In order to turn to the left the wheel is turned to the left, the machine swinging around easily and banking itself properly. When the turn is complete the wheel is brought back to center and "that's all there is to it". The jibs are triangular in shape with a balancing portion, and are pivoted at the points A and B as shown in this sketch, the wire C from the wheel going to the lower corner. When the wheel is turned, the lower corner of the jib is pulled in, thus presenting an obliquely inclined surface, offering resistance on that side."

Federation of Asian Chemical Societies

The Federation of Asian Chemical Societies (FACS) is a professional association representing chemical societies of countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region whose membership consists of individual qualified chemists. The group was founded in 1979.

Guinness Records (record label)

Guinness Records was the name of an American record label operational in 1977. It was, along with Tiger Lily Records one of the major tax scam labels, releasing around one hundred albums.
History.
Guinness Records was established in 1977 by Marvin L. Popkin as a tax shelter based around the idea of investing in a master recording that would be greatly over valued so that the investors could claim a tax loss when the deliberately under-promoted album failed to sell.
Most recordings were sourced from recording studio vaults and published as albums without the knowledge or consent of the performers. Several defunct bands are known to have had releases as a result of this practice, but the most high profile performers identified were Detroit area band The Rockets, Atlantic Starr, who had two unauthorized albums based on demo tapes released under their original name, Newban, independent musician R. Stevie Moore, who had a trio of demos released on an album attributed to a group called Hotgun, and The Vibrations, whose producer Robert John Gallo, provided the masters of the band's final album to Guinness Records, along with several other sets of masters, some unreleased, he had produced for other performers.
The types of albums released by Guinness fell into three broad categories:
Throughout its short existence, the label was closely associated with another tax scam label Dellwood Records, believed to be linked to Prelude Records, which acted as Guinness Records distributor.

2022 South Australian state election

The 2022 South Australian state election will elect members to the 55th Parliament of South Australia on 19 March 2022. All seats in the House of Assembly or lower house, whose current members were elected at the 2018 election, and half the seats in the Legislative Council or upper house, last filled at the 2014 election, will become vacant. 
Like federal elections, South Australia has compulsory voting, uses full-preference instant-runoff voting for single-member electorates in the lower house and optional preference single transferable voting in the proportionally represented upper house. The election will be conducted by the Electoral Commission of South Australia (ECSA), an independent body answerable to Parliament.
Background.
House of Assembly.
In the House of Assembly at the 2018 election, the Liberal opposition formed a two-seat majority government with 25 of 47 seats, after retaining three of the four redistributed notionally Liberal seats won by Labor at the 2014 election (Colton, Elder and Newland) and winning the newly-created notionally ultra marginal Labor seat of King. The former 16-year four-term Labor government went in to opposition with 19 seats. The crossbench was represented by 3 independents: Frances Bedford, Troy Bell and Geoff Brock. Despite the change of government, there was actually a statewide two-party-preferred swing away from the Liberals toward Labor.
Government loses its majority (2021).
The Liberal Party's already slender majority was further reduced when in February 2020, Sam Duluk, the member for Waite, had his Liberal membership suspended due to his personal conduct at a 2019 Christmas party which led to him being charged with assault by police. Duluk has since sat on the crossbench as an independent, and as of February 2021 his charge is being heard in the Adelaide Magistrates Court. 
That same month, Fraser Ellis, the member for Narungga, was charged by the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption (ICAC) with 23 counts of deception, relating to 78 fraudulent claims over the alleged misuse of a travel allowance totalling more than $18,000. ICAC's charge led to Ellis resigning from the Liberal Party and moving to the crossbench as an independent, reducing the Liberals to a minority government. 
Though in minority, the government cannot fall unless it loses a vote on confidence or supply. Such a vote would not pass without the votes of both Duluk and Ellis, and Ellis stated that he would continue to support the Marshall government on such matters.
Legislative Council.
In the Legislative Council at the 2018 election, the 11 of 22 seats up for election were 4 Liberal, 4 Labor, 1 Green, 1 Conservative and 1 Dignity. The final outcome was 4 Liberal, 4 Labor, 2 SA Best and 1 Green. Conservative MLC Dennis Hood, who had been elected as a Family First MLC in 2014, defected to the Liberals nine days after the 2018 state election. The 22 seat upper house composition is therefore 9 Liberal on the government benches, 8 Labor on the opposition benches, and 5 to minor parties on the crossbench, consisting of 2 SA Best, 2 Green, and 1 Advance SA. The government therefore requires at least three additional non-government members to form a majority and carry votes on the floor.
Date.
The last state election was held on 17 March 2018 to elect members for the House of Assembly and half of the members in the Legislative Council. In South Australia, section 28 of the Constitution Act 1934, as amended in 2001, directs that parliaments have fixed four-year terms, and elections must be held on the third Saturday in March every four years unless this date falls the day after Good Friday, occurs within the same month as a Commonwealth election, or the conduct of the election could be adversely affected by a state disaster. Section 28 also states that the Governor may also dissolve the Assembly and call an election for an earlier date if the Government has lost the confidence of the Assembly or a bill of special importance has been rejected by the Legislative Council. Section 41 states that both the Council and the Assembly may also be dissolved simultaneously if a deadlock occurs between them. This means that barring unforeseen events, the election will be held on 19 March 2022.
The Electoral (Miscellaneous) Amendment Act 2013 introduced set dates for writs for general elections in South Australia. The writ sets the dates for the close of the electoral roll and the close of nominations for an election. The Electoral Act 1985 requires that, for a general election, the writ be issued 28 days before the date fixed for polling (S47(2a)) and the electoral roll be closed at 12 noon, 6 days after the issue of the writ (S48(3(a)(i). The close of nominations will be at 12 noon 3 days after the close of rolls (Electoral Act 1985 S48(4)(a) and S4(1)).

Abyan conflict

The Abyan conflict was a series of clashes between forces of AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) loyal to Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, and forces loyal to Southern Movement for the control of Abyan.
Background.
Abyan was a stronghold for AQAP at the beginning of the civil war. AQAP was beginning to take pieces of southern Abyan in late 2016, when they captured Zinjibar and other towns. An internal crisis erupted in Abyan between the legitimate AQAP emir, Tawfiq Belaidi (brother of the late AQAP emir Hamza al-Zinjibari) and another AQAP warlord named Abu Anas al-Sanani, over who would succeed Hamza. It is unclear who won the day, but the conflict killed 7 and wounded 9.
Clashes and other incidents.
On February 21, AQAP militants withdrew from Ahwar city, after a failed attempt to consolidate control. AQAP militants attacked a popular resistance checkpoint, killing three, before erecting their own checkpoints and flying al-Qaeda’s flag from government buildings.
Militiamen from the Bakazim tribe massed outside Ahwar in response. AQAP agreed to withdraw under the terms of a tribal mediation allowing the group free passage through the city.
On March 8, AQAP gunmen abducted government official Haidara Daha at al Musaymir, west of Zinjibar. AQAP was consolidating control in Abyan governorate and targeted local leaders and officials opposed to its expansion.
On March 26–27, three US drone strikes killed eight AQAP members and three beekeepers in Al Mahfad District. Two Saudi planes launched rockets into an old office of the local government in Zinjibar, setting the building on fire. 10 AQAP fighters were believed to be killed.
On April 8, more than 35 Hadi Yemeni government soldiers were captured by AQAP soldiers in Ahwar. 17-20+ of them were executed by firing squad. The others were wounded but still alive, while others were believed to have escaped and reached safety. The soldiers were travelling from Aden to Al Mahrah Governorate via Ahwar, and were ambushed while passing Ahwar.
On April 9, AQAP denied that its fighters executed the soldiers, blaming a local fighter named Ali Aqel. "We entered Ahwar around two months ago to chase this corrupt individual and his gang," the statement said.
On April 14, an airstrike hit an AQAP checkpoint in the Al Kawd, killing 10 AQAP militants. tribal fighters loyal to Hadi ambushed an AQAP convoy in Mafhad, killing 3, including a commander, Amjad al-Wahti.
On April 17, two airstrikes hit Zinjibar, targeting the house of Tariq al-Fadhli. No info about casualties was provided.
Ground offensive.
On April 22, Hadi loyalists and their partners prepared to attack Zinjibar in a ground offensive. Southern Movement leader Omar Jardana from Hadramaut escaped an AQAP prison in Zinjibar, traveling to Aden. An airstrike on an AQAP HQ in Zinjibar killed 8 terrorists. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) commander Radwan Qanan was also killed, during an apparent meeting with al Qaeda there. Two other AQAP commanders, Abu Salem al-Adani and Abu Hamza al-Shabwani, were killed. Four other AQAP fighters were killed.
On April 23, the battle began, but the forces of Hadi loyalists retreated after AQAP militants detonated a Car bomb (VBIED) targeting an army convoy that killed 4 loyalists and injured 14 others. Reports indicated that AQAP had planned additional VBIED attacks. The Hadi government gave AQAP a 24-hour window in which to peacefully withdraw. Loyalists carried out another offensive in Jaʿār, that killed 25 AQAP militants and four soldiers and seized al Koud, three miles south of Zinjibar. Hadi loyals, cleared the entrance of Abyan (Aden-Abyan border). They advanced towards the city of Al Koud and expelled al-Qaeda stationed in the prison and on the coastal strip along the international stadium east of Zinjibar. According to officials, army forces were reached at the gates of the city of Zinjibar. The army reached Dofas, but was attacked by AQAP. Two soldiers were killed. AQAP did not agree with the deal that loyalists offered to them, so they remained in Zinjibar.
On April 26, a U.S. airstrike targeted a car carrying al Qaeda militants that was traveling between Ja’ar and Zinjibar. The strike killed 5 AQAP fighters, including local commander Abu Sameh al-Zinjibari.
Al Qaeda militants arrived in Zinjibar on April 27, after fleeing the coalition-led recapture of their stronghold in Mukalla, Hadramawt on April 23. Residents of Zinjibar demonstrated against AQAP on April 29, the first such demonstration since AQAP captured the city in December 2015. The demonstrators called for the liberation of Zinjibar from AQAP, emphasizing they would not allow their city to become a base for militant activity.
AQAP retreats and comebacks.
AQAP agreed to begin withdrawing from Zinjibar on May 3. AQAP had previously reinforced positions in western Abyan governorate ahead of a planned government offensive, but later agreed to begin withdrawing its forces after further negotiations. The group reportedly agreed on April 30 to withdraw from Zinjibar on the condition that government forces not enter the city and that local militias not resume their activities. AQAP sought guarantees that its members would remain immune from future prosecution. Local mediators gave the group three days to withdraw before a clearing operation on May 3, but offered an extension to avert a costly battle. Al Qaeda began withdrawing on May 5, evacuating several governmental buildings and retreating towards Shabwah Governorate.
On June 20, AQAP made a brief comeback in western Abyan, when they raided the central prison in Jaar, freeing prisoners and escaping unharmed.

O. C. Kaligis

Otto Cornelis Kaligis (born 19 June 1942) is an Indonesian lawyer serving a 10-year jail sentence for bribing judges.
Prominent cases.
Setya Novanto and Bank Bali case.
Kaligis represented deputy Golkar Party treasurer Setya Novanto when he was charged in August 1999 in connection with the Bank Bali scandal. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) had in February 1999 colluded with Golkar officials to force Bank Bali chief Rudy Ramli to pay Rp546 billion to Setya's company Era Giat Prima (EGP) in order to collect Rp904 billion owed by three banks taken over by IBRA. The money was then paid out in more than 150 transfers to politicians and legislators, partly in an effort to buy votes for the re-election of then-president B.J. Habibie. Setya, who was part of Habibie's re-election team, was in 2018 sentenced to 15 years in jail for his role in the case.
Sex tapes porn trial.
Kaligis represented Nazril "Ariel" Irham, lead singer of the band Peterpan, who was in January 2011 convicted of pornography and sentenced to three years and six months in jail over sex tapes made with his celebrity girlfriends Luna Maya and Cut Tari.
Omni Hospital misdiagnosis.
In 2009, Kaligis represented Prita Mulyasari, who was sued by Omni International Hospital in Tangerang, west of Jakarta, for defamation. Prita had written an email complaining the hospital had misdiagnosed her case of mumps as dengue fever. Omni reported Prita to police and she arrested. Judges dismissed the case, so Omni Hospital filed a civil case and Prita was ordered to pay Rp312 million in damages. When Prita appealed, the High Court upheld the decision. The Supreme Court overturned the damages verdict. In July 2011, Omni Hospital appealed the criminal case to the Supreme Court, which issued a guilty verdict and a suspended sentence. In September 2012 the Supreme Court overturned its guilty verdict. Kaligis defended Prita pro bono.
Nazaruddin SEA Games bribery.
Kaligis represented Muhammad Nazaruddin, the Democratic Party's former treasurer, who was in 2012 sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail for corruption. Nazaruddin, who had fled to Singapore and was arrested in Colombia, was convicted of accepting bribes for construction tenders for the 2011 South East Asian Games hosted by Indonesia. The Supreme Court in 2013 increased Nazaruddin's sentence to seven years. He also received a six-year sentence for money laundering. Kaligis in 2012 claimed he was still representing Nazaruddin, but rival lawyer Hotman Paris Hutapea said Kaligis had been dismissed.
JIS alleged child abuse cases.
Kaligis in 2014 represented an Indonesian woman who claimed her son was raped by cleaners in a toilet block at Jakarta International School (JIS, later renamed Jakarta Intercultural School). Kaligis accused JIS of tampering with evidence by firing the cleaners and renovating the toilet block. When the mother failed to obtain compensation because JIS was not liable for the cleaners, she declared two teachers at the school had also abused her son. South Jakarta District Court in April 2015 sentenced the teachers to 10 years in jail. They were acquitted by Jakarta High Court in August 2015. The Supreme Court in February 2016 overturned the acquittal and increased the sentences to 11 years. Kaligis also represented the mother in a failed 2015 effort to sue JIS for $125 million.
Jailed for bribery.
On 17 December 2015, Kaligis was sentenced to five years and six months in jail for bribing a clerk and three judges at Medan State Administrative Court (PTUN Medan) in North Sumatra province. Kaligis made the bribes through his subordinate, Gerry Baskara, providing Judge Tripeni Irianto Putro with S$5,000 and US$15,000; Judge Germawan Ginting and Amir Fauzi with $5,000 each; and a clerk with $2,000. The bribes were paid in an effort to influence a case involving alleged corruption by North Sumatra governor Gatot Pujo Nugroho and his wife, Evi Susanti. Jakarta High Court in June 2016 increased his sentence to seven years. The Supreme Court in August 2016 increased the sentence to 10 years. Kaligis appealed the sentence increase, claiming it was unfair. A Supreme Court in December 2017 cut his sentence to seven years. The judges who gave the sentence cut were Syarifuddin, Leopold Hutagalung and Surya Jaya.
Kaligis is serving his sentence in Bandung's Sukamiskin prison, where the prison head acknowledged Kaligis has been allowed out of the jail to deal with legal matters in Jakarta.

Pete Halat

Peter J. Halat, Jr. (born July 27, 1942) is an American politician and the twelfth mayor of Biloxi, Mississippi. In 1997, Halat was convicted for his involvement in a criminal conspiracy which led to the murders of Vincent Sherry, Halat's former law partner and a Mississippi judge, and Sherry's wife Margaret, a Biloxi city councilwoman, ten years previously. He was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years in prison, of which he served 15. Pete Halat was elected mayor in 1989 and lost a re-election bid in 1993.
The FBI investigation (led by agent Keith Bell, now retired) eventually ended the city's long tolerance for wide open, illegal gambling and striptease clubs with allegedly exorbitantly priced drinks.
Biloxi is now home to legal casino resort hotels, with 24-hour gambling, concert entertainment shows and restaurants.
History.
Pete Halat and Vincent Sherry became law partners in 1981. Sherry was appointed a circuit judge in 1986.
Dixie Mafia killings.
Kirksey Nix was involved in the 1987 murder-for-hire killing of Judge Sherry and Margaret (both 58) in Biloxi. In the hopes of earning enough money to bribe his way out of prison, Nix was running a dating scam targeting homosexual men, where he would pose as a gay single man and entice them into a relationship, frequently by sending sexually explicit photos cut out from magazines, only to concoct fictitious stories for needing money, such as being in trouble with the law and having to pay hefty legal expenses, and needing additional money so he could move in with them. The operation was run from both Nix's prison cell in Louisiana and Sherry law office, which at the time was Pete Halat's legal office, by Nix's girlfriend Sheri LaRa Sharpe after Vincent Sherry left to become a judge.
Nix's co-conspirator Halat had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from Nix to cover financial difficulties and blamed it on Vincent Sherry. Kirksey Nix believed his claim and ordered the deaths of Judge Sherry and his wife. Thomas Holcomb was hired by Nix to murder the couple in their home.
Conviction.
On October 23, 1996, Halat was indicted on federal charges related to his involvement in the 1987 murders of Vincent and Margaret Sherry. At the time the FBI believed that the two were killed on Halat's orders after he thought that Judge Sherry was stealing from a bank account Halat kept for an imprisoned client, which held funds from Kirksey Nix's "Lonely Hearts" dating scam targeting gay men. It would later turn out however, that Vincent Sherry had never stolen money from Kirksey Nix's dating scam and that it was in fact Pete Halat himself who had stolen upwards of $100,000 U.S. dollars from the Lonely Hearts scam. When Nix was enraged over noticing the amount of missing money and arranged for Pete Halat to visit him in prison and demanded an explanation from him, Halat quickly blamed Judge Sherry for the theft of the illicit funds and the two quietly agreed to have Judge Sherry and his wife murdered. Shortly thereafter, Kirksey Nix ordered the deaths of Vincent and Margaret Sherry for the alleged theft of his money, and the Dixie Mafia's leader on the streets, Mike Gillich, hired a hitman from Texas named Thomas Holcomb to commit the two murders. Thomas Leslie Holcomb was given the handgun with a homemade silencer which he used in the killings by Kirksey Nix's girlfriend Sheri LaRa Sharp, who in turn had received the gun from an enforcer for the Dixie Mafia named John Ransom who told her to give the gun to Holcomb for the hit on Mr. and Mrs. Sherry.
Halat was later convicted in 1997 of conspiracy to commit racketeering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to serve 18 years in prison.
Release.
Halat was released in 2013 after 15 years, 9 months and 7 days in jail at the age of 70 years old. He then worked at a church in Hattiesburg the remainder of the year. Halat still maintains he had no part in the murder plot.
Co-conspirators.
Kirksey McCord Nix, Jr. (born 1943) is serving life imprisonment [in the Federal Correctional Institution at El Reno, Oklahoma]. see public Bureau of Prisons records. Mike Gillich died of cancer in 2012. Thomas Leslie Holcomb, a Texas-based contract killer, was convicted of carrying out the killings and died in prison in 2005. John Ransom and Sheri LaRa Sharp, were both convicted in 1991 on federal conspiracy charges related to the two murders. Ransom was the Dixie Mafia hitman who supplied the gun used in the murders of Vincent and Margaret Sherry. Sharpe was Kirksey Nix's girlfriend who worked as a legal aid and helped him run his Lonely Hearts dating scam while he was in prison. The scam involved placing fraudulent ads in the national LGBT magazine The Advocate pretending to be young single homosexual men in legal trouble who needed money.
Media portrayals.
A 1999 episode of "The FBI Files" details the FBI investigation of the Dixie Mafia, Pete Halat, and Kirksey Nix and his Lonely Hearts scam. It was also featured in Dominick Dunne's program Power, Privilege, and Justice on January 31, 2007. It is also featured in Season 1, episode 5 of Unusual Suspects.

Church of the Third Order of the Holy Trinity

The Church of the Third Order of the Holy Trinity () is an abandoned Roman Catholic church located in Salvador, capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia. First built as a chapel in 1733 and later expanded into its current structure in 1739, the church was abandoned by the Archdiocese of São Salvador in 1990. Located in the decadent Água de Meninos neighbourhood, the church was abandoned for a whole decade until it was reclaimed by a group of homeless people known as the Trinity community in 2000.
History.
In 1733, the Brotherhood of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity took a piece of land from the parish of Santo Antônio Além do Carmo to build a chapel dedicated to both Our Lady of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity. This temple was built on the hill which gives access to the Água de Meninos neighbourhood. In 1739, the Brotherhood opted to build a larger temple in the current location In his 1800 document describing the city, Luís dos Santos Vilhena notes that the temple was known as Church of the Rosary. In this document, the church is described as having no towers yet.
In 1806, Pope Pius VII extinguished the Brotherhood of the Rosary and the Holy Trinity and created, in its place, the Third Order of the Holy Trinity – hence the church's name. In 1877, the government of Bahia donated the area of the Bom Jesus cemetery to the Order. In 1888, a fire consumed most of the church, leaving only its exterior walls intact. In 1968, the right tower collapsed after a storm. In 1990, the last mass was held in the church and it was completely abandoned for the next ten years.
In 2000, a Catholic monk named Henrique Peregrino organized a pilgrimage to Salvador and included the church in his travel itinerary. To his and his fellow pilgrims surprise, the church was closed. He then sought local Catholic authorities regarding the possibly of re-opening the church so that it could serve as a shelter for the poor. According to Peregrino, around a hundred people are assisted by him each year. Since 2007, he edits a bi-monthly newspaper called "Aurora da Rua", which has a circulation of 10.000 and aims to generate income for the homeless people he shelters in the abandoned church.
Structure.
The church is located on a flat terrain in the flank of the escarpment that divides Salvador in the Higher City and the Lower City. Its location in Avenida Jequitáia is near the Água de Meninos fish market, and the church building is accessed by a stairway. It has three aisles and its façade contains Rococo and Neoclassical elements, although it was decharacterized by the 1888 fire, poorly planned and implemented restorations, and the crumbling of the right tower in 1968. According to the Institute of Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Bahia, the building was "damaged by the insertion of non-conforming elements such as concrete slabs in the galleries". It no longer has windows and its images – "of the Holy Trinity, Our Lady of the Remedy and many others of lesser importance" – were collected by members of the Order due to the state of deterioration of the building. The members of the Trinity community have promoted small restorations and included, in the altar, images and religious elements from the various religions present in Salvador. Around the church there are 20 houses, some of which are rented or made available for the members of the Trinity community.
The Trinity community.
The Trinity community is a civil society group that provides assistance to the homeless population that live around the Historic Center of Salvador. Founded by the Catholic monk Henrique Peregrino, it refuses the label of non-governmental organization, considering that its philosophy and action differ from the NGO philosophy. There are 45 permanent residents in the church grounds, in addition to 50–60 homeless people which attend ecumenical cults and banquets held each Thursday. The food is prepared by the residents and the maintenance and cleaning of the spaces is made by everyone. Although it mostly caters to adults, the Trinity community maintains a project aimed specifically at young people. This project is run by a team formed by seven educators and two therapists, treating on average 50 to 60 children per day, performing a total of 1,200 consultations per month.
The community aims to overcome the homelessness of its members by adopting a five-step program. The first step is that of food: it is about feeding, sharing the meal and participating in its preparation, putting and end in the begging for food. The second step concerns the reception of newcomers, regardless of their situation – they may be either guests or new members of the Community. The third step is caring: regularizing the documentation of the homeless and/or restoring their health. The fourth step involves gaining independence through income generation: the community members produce sacred art and grow flowers and fruits for sale; they collect cardboard to sell for recycling; and sell the "Aurora da Rua" newspaper, which they write themselves. There are also cases in which members of the Trinity community gain access to a formal job through covenants that Peregrino maintains with private companies. The fifth and final step is gaining access to housing, and it represents an end with the homelessness situation.

The 2018 Northwestern Wildcats football team represented Northwestern University during the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The Wildcats played their home games at Ryan Field in Evanston, Illinois and competed in the West Division of the Big Ten Conference. They were led by 13th-year head coach Pat Fitzgerald.
Northwestern began the year with a 1–3 record after winning its conference road opener against Purdue but falling to non-conference foes Duke and Akron, as well as Michigan in their conference home opener. The team won their next four games, including wins over ranked opponents Michigan State and Wisconsin, before falling to Notre Dame, which secured a winless non-conference slate. Regardless, the Wildcats clinched their first Big Ten West Division title by defeating No. 21 Iowa the following week. They won their remaining two conference games to finish the regular season with a conference record of 8–1. In the 2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game, they lost to East Division champion Ohio State 45–24. The team was invited to the Holiday Bowl to play Pac-12 Conference runner-up Utah. The Wildcats won by a score of 31–20, their third consecutive bowl victory, which was a program first. In the final AP Poll of the season, the Wildcats were ranked 21st.
Quarterback Clayton Thorson led the team's offense, finishing with 3,183 passing yards, third most in the Big Ten Conference, to go along with 17 passing touchdowns and nine rushing touchdowns. Thorson, a fourth-year starter, finished his career as the school's all-time leading passer. Freshman running back Isaiah Bowser led the team in rushing with 866 yards, and wide receiver Flynn Nagel led the team in receiving with 780 yards. On defense, linebacker Blake Gallagher led the Big Ten in total tackles with 127. Fellow linebacker Paddy Fisher was named first team all-conference by the coaches, while defensive back Montre Hartage was named to the first team by the media. Head coach Pat Fitzgerald received the conference's coach of the year award.
Previous season.

Philip Arnold House

The Philip Arnold House, at 422 E. Poplar St. in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, is an Italianate-style house built in 1869. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The house was home of Philip Arnold, a confidence man at the center of the Diamond hoax of 1872.
It is a two-story house with a gable roof, built in a T-plan in 1869. Around 1912 a one-story frame porch was added, with Doric square posts, which was later partially enclosed. Around 1960 a one-story brick addition was also added.
It was deemed significant for its association during 1872–1879 with businessman Philip Arnold. The Kentucky historical society evaluation of the house includes this description:Arnold was a native of Elizabethtown who gained notoriety after claiming the discovery of diamond mines in Colorado and Arizona. Arnold formed a company to exploit the mines and moved back to Elizabethtown in 1872 a wealthy man. The mines later turned out to be a hoax and Arnold was the subject of several lawsuits and briefly spent time in the Elizabethtown jail. In 1872, he purchased this home from original owner William Wilson and lived here until his death. Arnold later opened a bank in the city and built the Gilded Age building, a prominent Italianate commercial building still standing, although altered, on the public square. Arnold's business dealings remained suspect in these years and in 1873 he was wounded in a shoot out with a rival businessman. Arnold continued to be active in local commerce until his death in 1879. The diamond hoax was one of the most famous of the 19th century and several books have been written dealing with Arnold and this famous incident.
The mansion was later the McMurtry family home and was "one of the city's most notable Italianate residences", but remodelling of the porch and the brick addition reduced its architectural merit, so it is not listed for its architecture.

Southern Damascus offensive (April–May 2018)

The Southern Damascus offensive began on 19 April 2018 when the Syrian Armed Forces began to clear an enclave held by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in southern Damascus in the Yarmouk Camp.
Background.
In March 2018, ISIL massacred dozens of Syrian soldiers in an offensive for al-Qadam. On 14 April, ISIL then began an offensive on the western axis of the al-Qadam neighborhood and on 15 April, ISIL's forces in the Yarmouk Camp shelled areas held by the government. On the same day, the Syrian government began redeploying soldiers from East Ghouta to the area in an attempt to surround the camp.
Offensive.
On 19 April, after a week of intermittent escalations, the Syrian Arab Army and allied Palestinian militias launched an offensive against the ISIL-held al-Hajar al-Aswad neighborhood and the Palestinian Yarmouk Camp. Barrages of missiles and artillery shells bombarded ISIL positions in the Yarmouk Camp, Qadam, and Tadamon districts of the ISIL pocket in more than 580 air raids, with local activists reporting at least 15 civilians killed and more than 100 wounded. The Russian air force also provided heavy support to the offensive. Following the barrages, the Syrian Army and allies stormed the western axis of al-Qadam. On 20 April, the army captured the Imam Ali mosque in Tadamon.
While state media and SOHR reported on 20 April that ISIL had agreed to surrender, fighting continued on 23 April. SOHR stated that some militants had rejected the agreement. On 22 April, it was reported that the Syrian army managed to capture Al-Zain neighborhood south of Al-Hajar Al-Aswad. The next day, two Army tanks were reportedly destroyed in the clashes which also left three pro-government Palestinian officers dead. On 24 April, the Syrian Army began dropping leaflets over Al-Hajar Al-Aswad, urging ISIL militants to surrender. The army had also reportedly entered the Joura district of al-Qadam, seizing some buildings and capturing the orchards.
The UNRWA reported around 5,000 Palestinians from Yarmouk were displaced to Yalda between 19 and 24 April, leaving 1,200 residents, although local sources reported 2,500 families or 3,000 people were still there. By 25 April, local sources said that at least 20 civilians had been killed. The UN described Yarmouk Camp as "transformed into a death camp", reporting thousands of homes and the last functioning hospital destroyed. The UK-based Action Group for Palestinians of Syria said 60% of the camp had been destroyed in the government offensive by 27 April.
On 25 April, despite facing heavy ISIL resistance, pro-government forces continued to advance on multiple axes of the pocket. Led by Republican Guard units, the Syrian Army continued their advance in the Al-Ma’edhiyah subdistrict, seizing more buildings near the Al-Asali axis. The SAA and allies also made advancements in the Baradi and Baradat neighborhoods in Tadamon.
On 26 April, the ISIL-affiliated Amaq Agency reported they killed three elements of the Syrian army including a lieutenant, while the government made limited gains in al-Hajar al-Aswad. While ISIL and SAA clashed, Tahrir al-Sham units repelled a separate SAA advance in the Yarmouk Camp.
On 27 April, ISIL shelled parts of the al-Qadam district. The SAA made additional advances in other areas in southern Damascus, 20 SAA soldiers were killed and 3 BMPs were damaged according to Amaq in the advances in al-Qadam. Another eight SAA soldiers were killed in advances in the al-Zayn neighborhood. On the same day, Syrian General Hassan Yusuf Mohammad was also killed in clashes in southern Damascus.
Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported on 28 April that the SAA had fully captured al-Qadam, Mazniyeh, Asali, and Jourah. On 29 April, SANA announced that an agreement was made to evacuate Syrian opposition fighters and family members from rebel-held areas east of Yarmouk. It also announced on 30 April that an agreement to evacuate civilians and fighters from Yarmouk was reached with HTS. Evacuations began later in the day and were completed by 1 May, bringing the 15% of Yarmouk that was held by HTS under government control.
On May 3, the SAA reported it had captured Munif Al-Anidi school and the cemetery in Hajar-Al Aswad, thus successfully splitting the ISIL-held pocket into two parts. On 4 May, Russian military police reportedly entered Beit Sahem as non-ISIL rebels continued evacuations from their previously-held areas east of Yarmouk. On 5 May, the Syrian Army and the Palestinian militia groups said they had fully captured the southern district of al-Hajar al-Aswad. By 5 May, the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that the Syrian army controlled two-thirds of the camp.
Between 5 and 12 May, both sides suffered heavy casualties as government advances slowed due to ISIL militants being entrenched in tunnels and underground shelters. The militants had also conducted constant counter-attacks. Local sources reported pro-government airstrikes and artillery fire on Yarmouk camp and al-Hajar al-Aswad throughout 7 May, with the aim of separating the two neighbourhoods, with 500 meters of ground gained. Pro-government media reported the killing of Hezbollah's Muhammad Ahmad Hourani and wounding of war correspondent Wasim Aissa during clashes in Yarmouk.
On 16 May, a new pro-government assault on the camp with air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles, with only a few hundred, mainly elderly, residents left inside; dozens of civilians and over 100 fighters on both sides were reported killed. SOHR reported that the SAA fully captured al-Hajar-al-Aswad. On 19 May, Russian and pro-government sources reported a ceasefire between the government and ISIL, although this was denied by official government media, and busloads of ISIL fighters were reported to be evacuated by the government. Just after midnight on 20 May, buses entered the ISIL enclave to evacuate the ISIL fighters, while ISIL burned its bases in preparation for the withdrawal. Despite reports of some continuing clashes in the area, the first batch of militants and their family members was evacuated towards the eastern desert.
On 21 May, pro-government troops fully recaptured Yarmouk camp, as ISIL fighters pulled out to deserts east of the city, thus allowing the Syrian Arab Army to fully control the capital after 6 years.
Aftermath.
In the month of fighting, a total of at least 73 civilians were reported killed in Yarmouk, and 7,000 people — including 6,200 Palestinians — displaced from their homes. An UNRWA spokesman said 100 to 200 civilians were estimated to still be in Yarmouk. Sheikh Mohammed al-Omari, a cleric loyal to the government, condemned government troops and allied militias for looting homes in the captured neighbourhood. According to "The Economist", many Palestinians believe the government plans to redevelop Yarmouk for use by Syrians.

Nita Spilhaus

Nita Spilhaus born Pauline Augusta Wilhelmina Spilhaus (5 February 1878 Lisbon - 12 September 1967 Rondebosch) was a Portuguese-born South African painter, working in oil, watercolour and pastel. She is best known for her landscapes, paintings and etchings of trees, her portrayals of the Cape mountains, and depictions of the Malay Quarter.
She was the daughter of Christian Ludwig Karl Spilhaus (27 June 1847 Lübeck - 13 September 1878 Lisbon) and Virginia Augusta Coelho (18 September 1855 - 5 February 1878). Her siblings were Virginia Henriette Wiesner (1874) and Karl Antonio Spilhaus (1876).
Nita's father moved from Lübeck in order to run a branch of the family business in Lisbon, and it was there that he met his Portuguese wife-to-be. After the loss of both her parents during her infancy, her mother dying in childbirth and her father some months later, Nita was raised by her grandfather in Lübeck, and her first training in drawing and etching took place at the Lübeck School of Art, then in Munich, where she attended a private art school run by Friedrich Fehr, the Dachau art colony just outside Munich under Adolf Hölzel, and copper engraving under . She was part of a young artists' community in Schwabing and in 1900 published a folio of her etchings.
She moved to South Africa in 1907 because of the death of her grandfather in 1906, joining her brother Karl, and the family of her uncle Arnold Wilhelm Spilhaus (1845-1946) at his home 'Hohenort' in Constantia, who had already settled in the Cape, was managing a successful import/export company, was an enthusiastic hiker and botanist, and was a founder member of the Mountain Club of South Africa. In due course she befriended various artists such as Edward Roworth, Moses Kottler, Allerley Glossop, Pieter Wenning, Ruth Prowse, Hugo Naudé and Florence Zerffi, who nursed her back to health during the 1918 flu pandemic.
She joined the 'South African Society of Artists' soon after her arrival. The "Cape Times" acknowledged her talent as a graphic artist by publishing a modest booklet of 12 etchings portraying scenes in and around Cape Town. Working from a studio in Keerom Street in Cape Town she gradually became a leading member of Cape Town's art community. When Hugo Naudé visited Munich in 1913 she took over his art classes in Worcester. Even so, in a frenzy of wartime paranoia her brother was charged with being a German conspirator, and she, also a German national, was severely restricted in her movements during WWI, being only permitted to paint indoors, resulting in a large number of still lifes. She also applied for a position as curator of the Michaelis Collection, but her German provenance disqualified her.
She married an osteologist Ernst Simon in 1921, the couple returning to Munich in 1925, living and working there until 1938,just before WWII, when they moved back to South Africa to stay. Ernst Simon died in 1943, and in the 1950s Nita and her widowed sister moved to Jonkershoek Valley. A progressive loss of eyesight forced her to cease painting.
Her oil paintings were Impressionist in style, her landscapes rich in atmosphere, while her flower studies are notable for their vivid colours. She had a particular affinity with trees and her striking images of the Stone Pines around Cape Town are a recurring theme in her work.
The name 'Spilhaus' is derived from the older German surname 'Spielhausen'.

Reception.
Robert Christgau said: "A waste. Vocalist Parker, an underrated blues pro, and organist McGriff, who has a name as a soloist but is better off accompanying, should produce a more than passable record almost automatically.

Jangheung Im clan

Jangheung Yim (or Im) clan () is one of the Korean clans. Their Bon-gwan is in Jangheung County, South Jeolla Province. According to the research in 2015, the number of Jangheung Yim (or Im) clan was 37,584. Their founder is YIM Ho () who settled in Jangheung. His son (Hangul: 임의; Hanja: 任懿) become the highest-rank government officer (Hangul: 중서문하평장사; Hanja: 中書門下平章事) under King Yejong of Goryeo and become Duke of Jangheung region that back then included the current Jangheung County and large parts of some adjacent counties, such as Boseong, Goheung, and Gangjin.
Goryeo Dynasty.
During the Goryeo dynasty, Jangheung Yim clan produced three prime ministers (Hangul: 삼중대광 정1품 품계, Hangja: 三重大匡; 文官) and many minister-level officers. Jangheung Yim was one of the ten clans who were allowed to marry the King's family members. For example, Queen Gongye is from Jangheung Yim clan and three of her sons become kings of Goryeo dynasty. They are King Uijong of Goryeo, King Myeongjong of Goryeo, and King Sinjong of Goryeo.
Joseon Dynasty.
Because Jangheung Yim clan had such a close relationship with the royal family of Goryeo dynasty, Jangheung Yim clan avoided government officer positions during the first 200 years of Joseon dynasty. Later when Chosun dynasty suffered from various internal and external events, some members of Jangheung Yim clan started to help the regime by becoming generals, mayors, and righteous army leaders. Some of them (e.g., ) fought against foreign armies when they invade. Some others were scholars. For example, Hee-Joong Yim (Hangul: 임희중, Hanja: 任希重) founded a school and taught many students. One of his books is now kept in the UC Berkeley East Asia library.
Republic of Korea.
Jangheung Yim clan produced a Korean war hero (General Chung-Shik Yim) who served as a national defense minister; a former minister of agriculture (); a politician (Im Jong-seok), and various other parliament members, high-rank government officers, mayors, lawyers, and scholars.

Sateska

The River Sateska is located in the south-west of North Macedonia. Currently a tributary of Lake Ohrid, it originally flowed directly into the River Black Drim but was re-routed in 1961/2. It now accounts for 39.36% of the Lake Ohrid watershed and is consequently one of its most important tributaries.
Artificial Reroute.
In 1961/2, the River Sateska was diverted from its natural path into the River Black Drim and instead routed into Lake Ohrid, which it enters on the northern shore between the cities of Ohrid and Struga. The Lake Ohrid catchment was expanded by 460 square kilometers in the process. The diversion was motivated by three main considerations:
Environmental Impact.
Since the 1960s, the River Sateska has been a major source of pollution and other negative anthropogenic impact upon Lake Ohrid, which is one of the most biodiverse inland waters on the planet. At peak times, the river can bring up to 129 tonnes of suspended material into the lake per day, which interferes with reed belts and spawning grounds for fish, a situation that has deteriorated after the abandonment of measures to reduce erosion.
The River Sateska is also the largest source of phosphorus inputs to Lake Ohrid and the second highest contributor of nitrogen (29%), both of which can instigate eutrophication processes. Indeed, the mouth of the Sateska holds some of the lowest quality water in all Lake Ohrid and displays evidence of eutrophication. Water oxygen levels have been influenced and a shift in species composition has been observed.
Due to environmental concerns, the World Heritage Committee has requested the Republic of Macedonia to explore options to re-divert the Sateska back to the River Black Drim.

<doc id="56944950" url="?curid=56944950" title="Metric temporal logic">
Metric temporal logic

Metric temporal logic (MTL) is a special case of temporal logic. It is an extension of temporal logic in which temporal operators are replaced by time-constrained versions like "until", "next", "since" and "previous" operators. It is a linear-time logic that assumes both the interleaving and fictitious-clock abstractions. It is defined over a point-based weakly-monotonic integer-time semantics. For MTL, the exact complexity of the satisfiability problems is known and independent of interval-based or point-based, synchronous (i.e., strictly-monotonic) or asynchronous (i.e., weakly-monotonic) interpretation: EXPSPACE-complete.
MTL has been described as a prominent specification formalism for real-time systems. Full MTL over infinite timed words is undecidable.
Syntax.
The full metric temporal logic is defined similarly to linear temporal logic, where a set of non-negative real number is added to temporal modal operators U and S. Formally, MTL is built up from:
When the subscript is omitted, it is implicitly equal to formula_1.
Note that the next operator N is not considered to be a part of MTL syntax. It will instead be defined from other operators.
Past and Future.
The past fragment of metric temporal logic, denoted as past-MTL is defined as the restriction of the full metric temporal logic without the until operator. Similarly, the future fragment of metric temporal logic, denoted as future-MTL is defined as the restriction of the full metric temporal logic without the since operator.
Depending on the authors, MTL is either defined as the future fragment of MTL, in which case full-MTL is called MTL+Past. Or MTL is defined as full-MTL.
In order to avoid ambiguity, this article uses the names full-MTL, past-MTL and future-MTL. When the statements holds for the three logic, MTL will simply be used.
Model.
Let formula_2 intuitively represent a set
of points in time. Let formula_3 a function which associates a letter to
each moment formula_4. A model of a MTL formula is
such a function formula_5. Usually, formula_5 is
either a timed word or a signal. In
those cases, formula_7 is either a discrete subset or an interval
containing 0.
Semantics.
Let formula_7 and formula_5 as above and let formula_10 some fixed time. We are now going to explain what it means
that a MTL formula formula_11 holds at time formula_12,
which is denoted formula_13.
Let formula_14 and formula_15. We first consider the formula formula_16. We say
that formula_17 if and only if
there exists some time formula_18 such that:
We now consider the formula formula_23 (pronounced "formula_11 since
in formula_25 formula_26.") We say
that formula_27 if and only if
there exists some time formula_28 such that:
The definitions of formula_13 for the values
of formula_11 not considered above is similar as the definition
in the LTL case.
Operators defined from basic MTL operators.
Some formulas are so often used that a new operator is introduced for
them. These operators are usually not considered to belong to the
definition of MTL, but are syntactic sugar which denote more
complex MTL formula. We first consider operators which also exists in LTL. In
this section, we fix formula_35 MTL formulas
and formula_14.
Operators similar to the ones of LTL.
Release and Back to.
We denote by formula_37
(pronounced "formula_11 release
in formula_25, formula_26") the
formula formula_41. This formula holds
at time formula_12 if either:
The name "release" come from the LTL case, where this formula simply
means that formula_11 should always hold,
unless formula_26 releases it.
The past counterpart of release is denote by formula_51
(pronounced "formula_11 back to
in formula_25, formula_26") and is equal to the
formula formula_55.
Finally and Eventually.
We denote by formula_56 or formula_57 (pronounced "Finally
in formula_25, formula_11", or "Eventually
in formula_25, formula_11") the formula formula_62. Intuitively, this formula holds at time formula_12
if there is some time formula_43 such
that formula_11 holds.
We denote by formula_66 or formula_67 (pronounced "Globally
in formula_25, formula_11",) the
formula formula_70. Intuitively, this formula
holds at time formula_12 if for all time formula_72, formula_11 holds.
We denote by formula_74
and formula_75 the formula similar
to formula_66 and formula_56,
where formula_78 is replaced by formula_79. Both formula has intuitively the same meaning, but when we
consider the past instead of the future.
Next and previous.
This case is slightly different from the previous ones, because the intuitive meaning of the "Next" and "Previously" formulas differs depending on the kind of function formula_5 considered.
We denote by formula_81 or formula_82
(pronounced "Next in formula_25, formula_11") the
formula formula_85. Similarly, we denote by formula_86 (pronounced "Previously in formula_25, formula_11) the formula formula_89. The following discussion about the Next operator also holds for the Previously operator, by reversing the past and the future.
When this formula is evaluated over a timed word formula_90, this formula
means that both:
When this formula is evaluated over a signal formula_5, the notion of next time does
not makes sense. Instead, "next" means "immediately after". More
precisely formula_95 means:
Other operators.
We now consider operators which are not similar to any standard LTL operators.
Fall and Rise.
We denote by formula_100 (pronounced "rise formula_11"), a formula which holds when formula_11 becomes true. More precisely, either formula_11 did not hold in the immediate past, and holds at this time, or it does not hold and it holds in the immediate future. Formally formula_100 is defined as formula_105.
Over timed words, this formula always hold. Indeed formula_106 and formula_107 always hold. Thus the formula is equivalent to formula_108, hence is true.
By symmetry, we denote by formula_109 (pronounced "Fall formula_11), a formula which holds when formula_11 becomes false. Thus, it is defined as formula_112.
History and Prophecy.
We now introduce the "prophecy" operator, denoted by formula_113. We denote by formula_114 the formula formula_115. This formula asserts that there exists a first moment in the future such that formula_11 holds, and the time to wait for this first moment belongs to formula_25.
We now consider this formula over timed words and over signals. We consider timed words first. Assume that formula_118 where formula_119 and formula_120 represents either open or closed bounds. Let formula_5 a timed word and formula_12 in its domain of definition. 
Over timed words, the formula formula_123 holds if and only if formula_124 also holds. That is, this formula simply assert that, in the future, until the interval formula_125 is met, formula_11 should not hold. Furthermore, formula_11 should hold sometime in the interval formula_125. Indeed, given any time formula_129 such that formula_130 hold, there exists only a finite number of time formula_43 with formula_132 and formula_99. Thus, there exists necessarily a smaller such formula_134.
Let us now consider signal. The equivalence mentioned above does not hold anymore over signal. This is due to the fact that, using the variables introduced above, there may exists an infinite number of correct values for formula_135, due to the fact that the domain of definition of a signal is continuous. Thus, the formula formula_114 also ensures that the first interval in which formula_11 holds is closed on the left.
By temporal symmetry, we define the "history" operator, denoted by formula_138. We define formula_139 as formula_140. This formula asserts that there exists a last moment in the past such that formula_11 held. And the time since this first moment belongs to formula_25.
Non-strict operator.
The semantic of operators until and since introduced do not consider the current time. That is, in order for formula_143 to holds at some time formula_12, neither formula_145 nor formula_146 has to hold at time formula_12. This is not always wanted, for example in the sentence "there is no bug until the system is turned-off", it may actually be wanted that there are no bug at current time. Thus, we introduce another until operator, called non-strict until, denoted by formula_148, which consider the current time.
We denote by formula_149 and formula_150 either:
For any of the operators formula_156 introduced above, we denote formula_157 the formula in which non-strict untils and sinces are used. For example formula_158 is an abbreviation for formula_159.
Strict operator can not be defined using non-strict operator. That is, there is no formula equivalent to formula_160 which uses only non-strict operator. This formula is defined as formula_161. This formula can never hold at a time formula_12 if it is required that formula_163 holds at time formula_12.
Example.
We now give examples of MTL formulas. Some more example can be found on article of fragments of MITL, such as metric interval temporal logic.
Comparison with LTL.
A standard (untimed) infinite word formula_170 is a
function from formula_171 to formula_172. We can
consider such a word using the set of time formula_173,
and the function formula_174. In this case,
for formula_11 an arbitrary LTL
formula, formula_176 if and only
if formula_177, where formula_11 is
considered as a MTL formula with non-strict operator and formula_1 subscript. In this sense, MTL is an extension of LTL.
For this reason, a formula using only non-strict operator with formula_1 subscript is called an LTL formula. This is because the
Algorithmic complexity.
The satisfiability of ECL over signals is EXPSPACE-complete.
Fragments of MTL.
We now consider some fragments of MTL.
MITL.
An important subset of MTL is the Metric Interval Temporal
Logic (MITL). This is defined similarly to MTL, with the
restriction that the sets formula_25, used in formula_182 and formula_183, are intervals which are not
singletons, and whose bounds are natural numbers or infinity.
Some other subsets of MITL are defined in the article MITL.
Future Fragments.
Future-MTL was already introduced above. Both over timed-words and over signals, it is less expressive than Full-MTL.
Event-Clock Temporal Logic.
The fragment "Event-Clock Temporal Logic" of MTL, denoted "EventClockTL" or "ECL", allows only the following operators:
Over signals, ECL is as expressive as MITL and as MITL0. The equivalence between the two last logics is explained in the article MITL0. We sketch the equivalence of those logics with ECL.
If formula_25 is not a singleton and formula_11 is a MITL formula, formula_114 is defined as a MITL formula. If formula_187 is a singleton, then formula_114 is equivalent to formula_189 which is a MITL-formula. Reciprocally, for formula_26 an ECL-formula, and formula_25 an interval whose lower bound is 0, formula_192 is equivalent to the ECL-formula formula_193.
The satisfiability of ECL over signals is PSPACE-complete.
Positive normal form.
A MTL-formula in positive normal form is defined almost as any MTL formula, with the two following change:
Any MTL formula is equivalent to formula in normal form. This can be shown by an easy induction on formulas. For example, the formula formula_194 is equivalent to the formula formula_195. Similarly, conjunctions and disjunctions can be considered using De Morgan's laws.
Strictly speaking, the set of formulas in positive normal form is not a fragment of MTL.

Bad Vilbel–Glauburg-Stockheim railway

The Bad Vilbel–Glauburg-Stockheim railway (also called the "Niddertalbahn"—Nidder Valley Railway) is a non-electrified branch line in the Wetterau and the Main-Kinzig districts of the German state of Hesse. It connects the Main-Weser Railway in Bad Vilbel with the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway in Glauburg-Stockheim.
It was used as an access route to the line now referred to as the "Oberwaldbahn" (Oberwald Railway) between Glauburg-Stockheim and Lauterbach, which connected to the Vogelsberg Railway. The section between Heldenbergen-Windecken (now Nidderau) and Stockheim was opened on 1 October 1905 and the section between Vilbel Nord (now Bad Vilbel) and Heldenbergen-Windecken was opened on 1 June 1907. It was operated by the Prussian-Hessian Railway Company ("Preußisch-Hessische Eisenbahngemeinschaft").
Route.
The single track section of the Nidder Valley Railway branches off from the Main-Weser Railway at Bad Vilbel station and turns to the east shortly after the northern exit from the station, crosses the Nidda and shortly later reaches the halt of "Bad Vilbel-Gronau". This is also the location of the mouth of the Nidder river, which it follows upstream to the end of the line. After "Niederdorfelden" station, which is a passing place, the line runs through the "Büdesheim Tunnel" between the municipalities of Schöneck and Nidderau. The tunnel was originally shorter but it was extended to 200 metres during its renovation in 2004. The original capstone of the tunnel portal, which has its construction years (1904–1906) carved into it and was built near the original Büdesheim station, is the last remaining relic of the old tunnel. Immediately after the tunnel, the line passes through the "Nidderwiesen" nature reserve and the edge of the town of Nidderau is soon reached at Windecken.
After a grade-separated crossing of the Friedberg–Hanau railway in Nidderau station, which was called "Heldenbergen-Windecken" for decades, the line follows the Friedberg–Hanau railway briefly, before turning towards Altenstadt. After a short section through a forest, it runs over a low embankment through an area that is subject to flooding by the Nidder to reach the forest again in Eichen. After a crossing of the Nidder before Höchst, the line soon reaches Altenstadt. Until about 1990, an industrial railway branched there to Waldsiedlung, which was three kilometres away. Less than an hour after leaving Bad Vilbel, after running through some meadows and crossing the Nidder again, the line finally reaches Glauburg and the station at the end of the line in the suburb of Stockheim where it meets the Gießen–Gelnhausen railway. Here it is the possible to continue towards Giessen or Gelnhausen.
An important traffic flow until the beginning of the 1990s was the daily "beet train" that ran in November and carried sugar beet from the region to the sugar factory in Friedberg and after its closure in 1981 to Groß-Gerau. Since the end of rail operations, this traffic is carried by road transport.
The line is 31 kilometres long between its terminal stations. The maximum line speed is 80 km/h. 35 tracks or roads cross the line and six level crossings are still not protected. One of these crossings was set to be abandoned, but the town of Bad Vilbel campaigned to keep it. This now has a 30 km/h speed limit.
Operations.
The Nidder Valley Railway was one of three railway lines integrated in the "Frankfurter Verkehrsverbund" (Frankfurt transport association, FVV) that was not operated as an S-Bahn line and was designated as an "N-Bahn" line. It is now operated by DB Regio Mitte as timetable route 634 on behalf of the FVV's successor, the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main transport association, RMV), as its line 34. Almost all of the Regionalbahn services on weekdays and about two thirds on Saturdays run to Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof, while the rest begin and end in Bad Vilbel.
There has also been a weekend service since 4 May 2008. As a result, RMV bus route 5150 (previously 650) between Bad Vilbel and Nidderau was discontinued on that day. In addition, with the commencement of the summer timetable of 2008, the maximum speed of trains was increased from 60 to 80 km/h and the interval between services was shortened on weekdays. The contract with Deutsche Bahn AG runs from 2008 for 20 years. According to a local newspaper from the Wetteraukreis, RMV's deputy chairman of the supervisory board reported that an additional 260,000 train-kilometres would be provided on the line during this period.
In recent years, millions of Euros have been spent on modernising the line. As a result, all the trackwork has been renewed. Instead of concrete sleepers, steel Y-shaped sleepers have been installed. Furthermore, all halts and platforms in the stations of Nidderau and Stockheim have been rebuilt and the exit height for the double-deck cars has been raised to 76 centimetres. Initially only the platform of the Nidder Valley Railway was upgraded in Nidderau, while that of the Friedberg–Hanau railway was renewed in 2010.
On 19 October 2007, the computer-based interlocking in Altenstadt was connected with two remote modules in Niederdorfelden and Nidderau; previously signalling and points in Niederdorfelden and Altenstadt was operated mechanically by cable. At the same time, new stations were relocated and new platforms were built at both stations, with temporary platforms initially being built to shorten the period of full closure. At the same time, there was a shift from left to right-hand operations at the intermediate stations. The modernisation work continued until the spring of 2008. The line speed was increased after the completion of all the work.
Nevertheless, the tender for operations in 2010 initially received no bids from train operating companies. After concessions by the RMV, DB declared itself ready to tender for it. The explanation given by the RMV emphasised the cost of operating diesel locomotive-hauled double-deck sets in the peak periods; this led to plans to upgrade the line.
Since 1985, when its decommissioning was considered, the line has seen an increase in passenger numbers of 330% from 1,800 to 6,000 per day; the upgrade is expected to continue to have a positive impact on passenger numbers. As of 2015, about 7,000 passengers used the line each day.
Rolling stock.
The Nidder Valley Railway was operated at the end of the 1990s in the peak hour with locomotive-hauled trains of Silberling coaches ("n-Wagen") and in the off-peak with class 628 diesel multiple units.
From 2002, trains were composed of class 218 locomotives hauling double-deck, or sometimes Silberling, coaches. From the beginning of 2006, a class 628 set shuttled between Stockheim and Bad Vilbel in the off-peak hours as a replacement for trains consisting of a class 218 locomotive and Silberling coaches.
In December 2012, the majority of services changed over to of Siemens Desiro Classic (class 642) diesel railcars, mostly in coupled sets and the remaining trains consisting of a class 218 locomotive and double-deck coaches.
At the December 2014 timetable change, the class 218 diesel locomotives were replaced by class 245 (TRAXX) locomotives.
Prospects.
The RMV is planning to upgrade the line in response to demands from the neighbouring communities and districts. With electrification, the current costly and isolated operation with diesel railcars or diesel-hauled double-decker trains might be a thing of the past in time for the retendering of operations from 2028. In parallel selective upgrade measures (the installation of crossing tracks at stations, two-track sections) would make possible the intensification of services. A feasibility study is currently underway on the future of the Nidder Valley Railway, in which the options for its operation as an (electrified) regional railway, as a branch of S-Bahn line S6 or as an extension of U-Bahn line U5 are being compared.

Ponerorchis basifoliata

Ponerorchis basifoliata is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to south-east China (south-east Sichuan, north Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1902 by Achille Eugène Finet, as "Peristylus tetralobus" f. "basifoliatus". It was later raised to a species and transferred successively to the genus "Orchis" and then to the genus "Amitostigma". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with "Amitostigma basifoliatum" becoming "Ponerorchis basifoliata".

Bobae Market

Bobae Market (, , ), usually shortened to "Bobae", is a well-known cheap clothing market, both retail and wholesale. The market area has two huge wholesale shopping areas, Bobae Market and Bobae Tower.
Bobae Market's site on Krung Kasem Road along Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem (Phadung Krung Kasem Canal) in Khlong Maha Nak Subdistrict, Pom Prap Sattru Phai District, is between the Yotse Bridge (Kasat Suek intersection) and Jaturapak Rangsarit Bridge (Saphan Khao intersection) in Si Yaek Maha Nak Subdistrict, Dusit District, with some parts overlaps Rong Mueang Subdistrict, Pathum Wan District.
The term "bobae" in Thai means 'noisy' or 'boisterous'. It's assumed that the name is derived from the word "bong beng" (บ้งเบ้ง), which describes the general condition of the market.
Bobae Market was founded c. 1927 by Thai-Chinese group who gathered to sell local products such as coconut water, tea, coffee, or various agricultural products. During World War II the focus changed to used clothing. At first, the clothes sold were those of persons who had died in the war.
The market is open from 06:00 to 18:00 daily, Then during the night other sellers arrive to sell until dawn. Especially during the night, this is a very bustling market. 
This market is accessible by BMTA's bus routes 37, 53, 556 with a total of six bus stops both sides of Krung Kasem Road, including Khlong Saen Saep boat service by Talad Bobae Pier (W03).

Peter Finch Martineau

Peter Finch Martineau (12 June 1755 – 2 December 1847) was an English businessman and a philanthropist, with particular interest in improving the lives of disadvantaged people through education.
Life and family.
A Unitarian, he was born into the renowned Martineau family of Norwich and christened in the Octagon Chapel. His eldest brother Philip Meadows Martineau became a distinguished surgeon and his youngest brother Thomas fathered sociologist Harriet Martineau and religious philosopher James Martineau. Engineer John Martineau was another of Peter's nephews.
His first wife Susannah Scott had one son and his second marriage to Catherine Marsh brought him five more children, of whom Peter Martineau Jr was the oldest and Catherine Jr their first daughter – she married solicitor Edward Foss. Peter Jr wed Eliza Barnard and then Mary Anne, the sister of his schoolmate Sir Francis Ronalds. Peter Jr and Mary Anne's children included Sarah, whose husband was brewer and benefactor Charles Edward Flower. Peter and Catherine were buried at West Norwood Cemetery.
Business interests.
Peter Finch Martineau was active in various distinct businesses through his life. He was first a textile dyer in Norwich with his older brother David. He, David and their younger brother John then established a brewery at the King's Arms Stairs (one of the watermen's stairs on the Thames), which merged with Whitbread in 1812. Next followed a sugar-refining partnership in Goulston Street, Whitechapel with his son Peter Jr, which continued until around the latter’s death in 1869; Peter Jr patented an important new process for clarifying sugar in 1815 with his cousin John Martineau. Peter Finch also opened a bank in St Albans after he moved there in 1818.
The family in addition invested in mining operations in Devon, Cornwall and overseas, managed by Peter Jr's second cousin John Taylor. These included the Wheal Friendship mine at Mary Tavy and United Mines near Redruth. They also held Directorships in various Assurance companies: Peter Finch in the Hand in Hand Fire Insurance Society, and Peter Jr in the Equitable Assurance Office – he also served as auditor of the Phoenix Fire Assurance Company. 
Education initiatives.
The Martineaus supported a wide range of targeted education initiatives. Peter Finch was an early Governor of the African Institution, founded by abolitionists when they succeeded in making the British slave trade illegal. He helped establish the School for the Indigent Blind in 1800 and was still chairing its meetings nearly half a century later – the organisation continues today as SeeAbility. He was also a Governor of the London Asylum for the Support and Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor; the House of Refuge for Orphan Girls; and the Refuge for the Destitute, which assisted people discharged from prison to enter the workforce. Finally, he served as Vice-President of the Manchester Academy Nonconformist higher education institution in York for nearly two decades. 
Political activities.
Like others in his family, Martineau was Whig cum Radical in his politics. A friend of the political philosopher William Godwin, he joined the London Revolution Society and was an energetic supporter of Norwich MP William Smith. He later served as Deputy Lieutenant of Hertfordshire. Peter Jr played an active role in the Anti-Corn Law League from its beginnings in the late 1830s, where he chaired large meetings in the boroughs where he lived and worked to garner support for the removal of import duties.

Gaspër Jakova Mërturi

Gaspër Jakova Mërturi (1870-1941) was a figure involved in the Albanian National Awakening and a talented writer.
Mërturi was from northern Albania who had been defrocked as Catholic priest and was an ex-Jesuit. Italy recruited individuals from the Albanian Catholic clergy to work for them and he became employed as an instructor at the Collegio of Sant'Adriano and later as a publicist editing works such as newspapers in Albanian. Mërturi along with Italo-Albanian Anselmo Lorecchio during June 1904 published an Italian language daily newspaper "Agenzia Balcanica ed Italiana" that focused on politics, finance and commercial information. Its aims were "to enlighten the European public opinion" about the rights and necessary reforms for the vilayets of Üsküb, Shkodër, Monastir, Yanina, and Salonica. In Rome, Mërturi began publication of a fortnightly newspaper "The Herald of Albania" written mainly in Italian on September 15 1904 that focused on Albanian independence and unity, without going into details about how they would be achieved. Mërturi encouraged the writing talents of his students like Luigj Gurakuqi, who also became contributors to the Albanian national awakening.

Diuris luteola

Diuris luteola, commonly called the northern doubletail, is a species of orchid which is endemic to Queensland. It has a single linear leaf at its base and up to six pale yellow flowers with a few brown markings. It grows in shallow, stony soil on tablelands in eastern parts of the state.
Description.
"Diuris luteola" is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single linear leaf long, wide with a purplish base. Up to six pale yellow flowers with a few brown markings, about wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal projects forward and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, green with brown blotches, long, about wide, turned downwards and crossed over each other. The petals are more or less erect, spread apart from each other with an elliptic to egg-shaped blade with the narrower end towards the base. They are long and wide on a dark reddish brown stalk long. The labellum is long, usually projects forwards and has three lobes. The centre lobe is linear to egg-shaped, wide with a few pale brown markings. The side lobes are linear to oblong, erect, about long and wide. There are two parallel ridge-like calli about long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris luteola" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and Bruce Gray from a specimen collected on the Atherton Tableland near Herberton and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("luteola") is a Latin word meaning "yellowish", referring to the colour of the flowers of this species.
Distribution and habitat.
The northern doubletail grows in shallow soil in grassy forest from Mount Windsor adjacent to the Daintree National Park to the Blackdown Tableland.
