Plot.
Kika (Xuxa Meneghel) is a math teacher in a quiet inner-city who cherishes her dream of being an actress. Encouraged by her childhood friend, Lara (Alice Borges), she decides to participate in a casting test in Rio de Janeiro. After losing her wallet and quarrelling with Lara, Kika finds herself at the bus station alone and without a penny in her pocket. The young teacher is then approached by a kindly grandmother, Vozinha (Dirce Migliaccio), who invites her to board the Stromboli, a bus that is taking her own granddaughter (Raquel Bonfante) and six other children to do a math test in Rio. Kika becomes friends with the two while waiting for the departure of the bus.
Beginning with a TV report in which Lara and Pandora (Betty Lago) appear, a news reporter is seen asking for information regarding their whereabouts. Frightened, and fearing the police presence at the bus station, Kika accepts a magic cookie offered by Vozinha, the effect of which makes her a child again. So it is that as Kikinha (Letícia Botelho) joins the group of Stromboli.
The pilot Olavo (Luan Assimos), MP9 (Gabriel Lepsch) and Batata (Victor Andrade) are also on the bus, along with the patrons Glorinha (Maria Clara David), Thayane (Gabrielly Nunes) and Vanessa (Isabela Cunha). But the engine pifa and the troupe are forced to spend a night at a roadside hotel - run by the hard-nosed Elói (Marcelo Adnet). It is there that the characters will live out their most entertaining adventures and learn a little more about themselves.
The story unfolds amid positive messages regarding ecological issues, the background of the novel between Kika and the environmentalist Ricardo (Carlos Casagrande). On a symbolic journey that does not always need to tread real roads, Kika learns that, rather than focusing on the destination, one must be aware of the paths one chooses to arrive at it. It is important to believe in the signs that life offers us, so that the true dream of each person can be realized.
Production.
Background and conception.
Xuxa Meneghel, who is the owner of the highest average audience in the resumption of Brazilian cinema (2.5 million per film) and accumulated box office, created her new feature film "Xuxa en Sonho de Menina", the 17th of her career. grossing R$6 million reais. This is the first cinematographic partnership of "Xuxa Produções" with "Conspiração Filmes" in the making of feature films (the producer has already signed the DVD "Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 7" (2007). The co-production is from Globo Filmes and Warner Bros.. The actress and host already has more than 35 million viewers since 1983, the year of her film debut. In 1988, the host starred in her first feature ("Super Xuxa contra Baixo Astral"). Its biggest box office is "Lua de Cristal" (1990): 5 million viewers. The idea of producing a film with this content came from the very personal experience of Xuxa. When she was 10 years old, Xuxa dreamed of having a bluebird. Although she had heard from her mother that, unfortunately, that was not possible, she did not give up on the dream and continued to believe, until one day, a real bluebird came through her window and became part of the family. The event - a landmark in the life of the host - is used as a starting point for "Sonho de Menina", which deals precisely with one of Xuxa's greatest convictions: the importance of believing in dreams for them to come true. Xuxa explained the concept of the film.
The screenplay by Flavio de Souza, responsible for the plot of other films of the hots, such as "Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço" (2005), "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" (2004) and "Xuxa Abracadabra" (2003). His text came to life through the eyes of director Rudi Lagemann, the "Foguinho", invited by Conspiração Filmes especially for the project. He explained the concept of the film.
Cast.
The role of Kikinha, the children's version of the protagonist, was Leticia Botelho, who had already participated in the feature films "Ouro Negro" (2006) and "Fica Comigo Essa Noite" (2006), as well as presenting the program "Janela Janelinha" on TVE Brasil. To accomplish the scenes, Leticia had an intense preparation with the director and Xuxa, who had to observe to capture both the gestural and the way of speaking of the hots. "Staying with Xuxa, playing with the little rocker and the kids was a lot of fun," says the young eight-year-old actress. I find it harder in the scene where you do not speak, but you have to record the expressions because you can not open your mouth to speak. You have to speak with your face," he continues.
The cast also includes Betty Lago (in the role of Pandora Raquel, a powerful TV producer), Ilana Kaplan (Aunt Memelia, who takes care of the children on the trip), Alice Borges (Lika, Kika's best friend), Sérgio Loroza the driver Jeandro) and Marcelo Adnet (Elói, the hotel's doer). And with special guest appearances by Dirce Migliaccio (the grandmother of one of the girls on the tour), Letícia Spiller (mother of Kika as a child), Milton Gonçalves (director of the school where she works) and Alexandra Richter (a casting producer).
In the children's cast, the film star Maria Clara David, who previously had participated in commercials and TV shows, such as "Zorra Total", "Sob Nova Direção" and "Linha Direta", by Globo TV, stand out. She plays Glorinha, a girl who is pressured by her parents to pursue a future that is not exactly what she dreams for herself. "The movie talks about it too. You have to think about whether you're running after the right dream, or if that's not just the dream your father or mother wants for you, "says Xuxa.
Carlos Casagrande lives with Ricardo, the romantic couple of Xuxa, and leads the environmental message of the film. He plays a biologist and environmental secretary for Quimera, a fictional city where people are ecologically conscious and take care of everything not to attack the planet. "Xuxa is a very calm person. It's very nice to work with her" says Casagrande. For the actor, the director Foguinho has a lot of patience and tranquility to deal with children. "His sensitivity is very great. He passes everything he wants from the actor in a very clear way. First, it makes you feel comfortable doing what you have in your head, and then it shapes."
Filming.
Most of the scenes from "Xuxa en Sonho de Menina" were filmed on location in the capital and the interior of the state of Rio de Janeiro, with only two days of filming in a studio. Places known to Cariocas, such as the Glauce Rocha Theater in the Center, and the Lage Park, in addition to the Hotel Le Canton in Teresópolis, were redecorated and served as a setting for history. The Jockey Club, located in the South Zone of Rio, was transformed into a bus station and, to look like a small town terminal, only a small part of the central hall in which the betting bag occurs was used. It is at this point in the film that the transition from reality to the dream happens and vice versa. In this way, the space had to be decorated in two different ways, to distinguish both universes. "We created two versions for every road sign, real-world signs were more facetious, square, and dreamy," says Art Director Daniel Flaksman. It was a mansion in Alto da Boa Vista that received the main scenes of the film, to generate the "cartunesca" atmosphere of Hotel Paratodos. "The hotel is the greatest setting in terms of concepts because we had to change the facade, the reception, the dining room, the staircase, the corridors and the rooms," says Flaksman.
Each of the rooms was ornamented with strange objects ordered improbably. The idea was to bring in "visual jokes" so that the environment would indeed look like a dream. "We put a picture upside down, a giant log book... it has a wall with several clocks, the pointers do not walk and each one sets a different time. Why don't they walk? Because time stands still, "he explains. One day after the filming began, director Rudi Lagemann already felt the usual apprehension that precedes the beginning of the production of a feature film. "We are anxious, in a hallucinatory rhythm of preparation, an immense team of artists and technicians rehearsing, designing choreographies, making costumes, constructing scenarios to arrive at this magic hour that is to enter the set, and we can say the blessed word: 'Action!' "Said the director, at the time, noting that filming is, in all its aspects, a moment of great pleasure. "I feel privileged. I love filming, solving typical shooting problems, exchanging ideas, directing actors, choosing camera angles. It's very enjoyable to get along with good-humored and intelligent people, and the movies provide that."
Preparing the cast during pre-production helped to ensure that everyone was tuned in to shoot the scenes. Xuxa participated actively in the trials. "I really like essays because we exchange ideas with them and consistently build the dramatic tempo of a cinematic narrative. Adults and children rehearsed with Xuxa. These rehearsals were marked by fun and professionalism and all contributed to characterize their characters and give internal rhythm to the scenes" says Foguinho. The "Xuxa em Sonho de Menina" set was marked by the daily presence of many children. In addition to the children cast, on many occasions, children of team members were invited to watch the footage. This made the environment a relaxed place, which eventually infected the adults. "We have become a little brat, having fun as they have fun," confirms actor Serjão Loroza. "I really like being in touch with the kids because they bring new energy to the set," adds Dirce Migliaccio. At the time of the scenes, however, the work was taken very seriously. "We used to play every day and rehearsal was messy all the time, but at the time of the scene it was full concentration," says Maria Clara David, who plays Glorinha. After four weeks on the set, he was sure that the work was well done, despite the short time to meet the schedule. For the director, the professionalism of his team and the serenity of Xuxa were determining factors for the good environment of filming. "The great difficulty was the meager time for preparation and filming. The team was able to transform, with creativity and talent, such difficulty in quality differential ", praises. "What could become a tense process has become something pleasurable. And much of this is due to the playful and peaceful spirit of Xuxa", he adds.
Special effects.
The visual effects were developed and executed by the post-production team of "Conspiração Filmes", in partnership with "Megacolor", under the supervision of Cláudio Peralta and Adenilson Muri Cunha, two specialists in the area. "We have already begun the process knowing what scenes we would play in the story. Our main job was to print a magical and fanciful character at specific points in the film. They are subtle and beautiful effects, pleasant for both adults and children", says Peralta.
Musical Production.
Ary Sperling is the author of the musical production and soundtrack of the film, whose theme "Sonho de Menina (Eu Acredito)" is a collaboration between him and Vanessa Alves, who has participated in other projects of the presenter, such as the DVD "Xuxa Só Para Baixinhos 7". "The song was based on the script and the elements that Xuxa asked were: talking about imagination, the power to believe in things and run after your dreams, paying attention to the signs. It seems like an obvious thing, but a lot of people do not realize the circumstances of life" summarizes Ary.
Release.
The press conference of presentation of the film occurred on December 14, 2007, The premiere took place on December 11, 2007, in São Paulo and December 19, 2007, in Rio de Janeiro. The site teaser was developed by the agency RMG Connect, the site allows the Internet users to check the teaser trailer, some photos, the synopsis and the technical file of the film. The film was released on December 21, 2007.
Reception.
Critical response.
The site "Cine Dica" gave an average score of 34 points to the movie. The audience surveyed by "Filmow" gave the film an average of 2.1 votes. The "Adorocinema" audience gave the film four and a half stars out of five, and an average of 3.5 points. In a poll conducted by "The Enemy", the film was voted worst of the year, with more than 52% of the audience vote.
Diego Benevides writing for "Cinema com Rapadura", gave the film only a 1 note, defined "Xuxa em Sonho de Menina", as one more unsuccessful onslaught from the children's film presenter, writing that "The story of Flávio de Souza has more quality than the lousy "Xuxa Gêmeas", but still makes a point of highlighting the TV hots as a child. There is always the moment when Xuxa equals the public, whether in the way of dressing or telepathy with a teddy bear named Bebeto. Xuxa is already in her forties and the main reason for the failure in its televising or cinematographic attacks is to remain in the usual." He praised the adult cast of the film, however, considered them to be "in a story that no character is deepened, other than Xuxa herself or her miniature, the nice Leticia Botelho." To the critic "all the technical aspects are regrettable, but the soundtrack and the sound can be shameful. In addition to the invariable songs that accompany the heroes in the story, the audience has yet to witness the constant use of 'toin' BGs and such 'grace-making' stuff in the story. It even seems that the technical team is doing one of those pictures of the children's program of Xuxa, without the slightest responsibility of having a cinematic posture." A critic of "Cineclick", compared "Sonho de Menina", with the previous film of Xuxa, "Lua de Cristal" (1989), for having as an intention to transmit to the viewers "messages of realizing the dreams, but now the presenter wants to give a new learning to the" little ones: to want, power and achieve. It is the formula of success." He defined the film's script as "autobiographical, with stories from Xuxa's past, seasoned with fiction." He praised the performance of Letícia Botelho, writing that she has a "sweet and sweet way that enchants." But she criticized the script for the film, stating that "What could signal a change of style in a production starring Xuxa is not happening, as "Xuxa em Sonho de Menina" retains the characteristics of her previous films that is not found in this production, the pattern of the previous ones is followed: adventure, a light novel, children and a hideous villain." The "Cine Gospel" site criticized the film's performances, writing that "they are all pretty bad, taking away from the always excellent veteran Dirce Migliaccio." The actress children are not good enough and Xuxa plays, as always, Xuxa. He praised the production for representing a breakthrough in Xuxa's film career, writing that unlike his predecessors, "it does not bring fashionable singers as pseudo-actors, and the audience is largely spared from traditional musical numbers." The site defined the story as puerile by writing that it can even reveal its superficiality if we think it is aimed at children. But according to him, the children deserved more. Luiz Joaquim writing for the "Cinema Escrito" said that there is something nice in "Sonho de Menina", unlike his recent work for the movies. "The fact that it is an urban story with a few fantastic elements has made it closer, and therefore easier, in a good way." For the author, the ecologically correct galan interpreted by Carlos Casagrande, "has no narrative function, only to be beautiful." but he praised the performance of Sergio Loroza, as the driver of the Stromboli bus. Writing that "Despite the weight, Segio transits light through the entire film." Writing for the "Omelette", Marcelo Forlani wrote that "In the movie, Xuxa dreams of being an actress, but in real life, she has given up." Mariane Morisawa from "Terra" gave the film three stars. She wrote that the film "is funny and reminds us in some moments of the presenter's trajectory, but misses mixing ecological messages with messages about dreams".
Box office.
"Xuxa em Sonho de Menina" was a box office failure, conquering a smaller audience than all the films starring the TV hots since "Xuxa Requebra" (1999), accounting for meager 309,174 box offices. The bad performance of the films of TV hots recorded in recent years is the result of the separation between Xuxa and Diler &amp; Associados. "Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço" (2005), an animated film that had the special participation of the presenter in flesh and blood, was until then the lowest income of the brand, with 596,218 spectators. The latter, "Xuxa Gêmeas" (2006), garnered just over a million box offices. The film was withdrawn from display in theaters in Rio de Janeiro, and just 2 months after its launch, due to the weak box office, continuing in only 16 other rooms in Brazil. The film grossed only 1,814,152 million reais, the lowest gross of a film starring Xuxa, of all time.

AgWeatherNet is an automated agricultural weather station network operated by Washington State University in the Pacific Northwest. It is the first and the largest agricultural weather network in the United States. Every 5 seconds, over 175 sensors (as of 2018) record air temperature, relative humidity and dew point, soil temperature at 8 inches, rainfall, wind speed, wind direction, insolation and leaf wetness. The data is reported back from each sensor to WSU's Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center in Prosser, Washington and made available to the public on the Internet. The network can be used to predict and warn of crop hazards such as freezes (especially damaging to Washington fall crops like apples) and hailstorms.
Sensors are located mostly in the irrigated regions of Eastern Washington like the Yakima Valley, but also cover some non-irrigated areas like the Palouse and areas of Western Washington such as the Chehalis River valley. The Oregon Hop Commission funds three sensors in northwest Oregon. Several cranberry farming concerns fund a sensor at Grayland on the Pacific Coast.
The system began in 1988 with the name Public Agricultural Weather System (PAWS).

Locomotive SFAI 1400

Locomotive SFAI 1400 was a small 0-4-0 tank locomotive built in 1870 for the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) by Cockerill of Seraing.
History.
It was originally used by the construction company of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel for the haulage of works trains. On completion of the work in 1871, it passed to the SFAI, which numbered it 1400. In 1885, when the great national networks were created, the locomotive passed to the Rete Mediterranea, where it took the number 5101. In 1905, on the nationalization of the railways, it entered the stock of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), which placed it in Class 800 with the number 8001. Curiously, the other engine in the class, 8002, was completely different, being a more powerful engine with a separate tender.

Win Bigly

Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter is a 2017 nonfiction book by Scott Adams, creator of "Dilbert", and author of "How To Fail At Everything and Still Win Big". The book presents Adams's theory that Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 United States presidential election was due to Trump being a "master persuader" with a deep understanding of persuasion and the human mind.
In 2015, Adams publicly predicted Trump's victory. Adams later cited his research into the field of persuasion as the basis for his claim. He wrote "Win Bigly" to analyze Trump's tactics and offer guidance to improve readers' communication skills. He describes people who, like Trump, are skilled at convincing listeners as "master persuaders". He posits that when debating an issue, facts are only important when they can impact at an emotional level.
Reception.
"Florida Today" described the subject matter as "something of great value in today’s media-saturated environment," and "Publishers Weekly" thought "Win Bigly" was "highly readable" and handled in a skillful and humorous manner. "Politico" found the book to be "an oxygen-free cubicle into which is piped a barking infomercial for the president." "Win Bigly" was a best-seller and brought increased attention to Adams' blog; "Michael Schein" speculated that Adams exploited Trump's popularity to protect his career as the newspaper industry declines.

K. S. Isles

Keith Sydney Isles (4 August 1902 – 18 June 1977) was an Australian economist, academic and university administrator.
History.
Isles was a son of Tasmanian farmer Sydney Henry Isles and his wife Margaret Ellen Isles, née Knight. He grew up with his parents in Spring Valley, Oatlands, Tasmania
Isles was educated at Hobart State High School and the University of Tasmania under Professor D. B. Copland, later Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Melbourne University. 
He joined the Tasmanian Education Department and taught there for a few years before accepting an appointment to teach (and coach football) at St Peter's College, Adelaide, while continuing his studies at the University of Adelaide.
In 1925 he received his Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Tasmania, and in the same year won the University of Adelaide's Tinline Scholarship.
He went to Cambridge University, where he studied under Keynes, and graduated MA and MSc.
From 1929 to 1931 he was a research fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, and admitted to the prestigious Keynes Club. His work won him a Wrenbury Scholarship in 1930 and the Adam Smith Prize in 1932.
In 1931 he was appointed Lecturer in Economics at the University of Edinburgh.
He was in 1937 appointed Professor of Economics at Swansea University, being highly commended by John Maynard Keynes, then at King's College, Cambridge, and by D. H. Robertson, of Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was appointed to the Chair of Economics, University of Adelaide, in November 1938. In 1942 he was seconded to the wartime Commonwealth Rationing Commission as an economic adviser, and appointed temporary lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Army to provide economic advice.
He was a member with Sidney Crawford and half-a-dozen diverse people of influence in the liberal South Australian think tank "Common Cause", which discussed post-war reconstruction.
In 1945 he left Adelaide for Belfast, where he had been appointed Professor of Economics, and Dean of the Faculty of Economics at Queen's University, Belfast.
He was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania in November 1956, succeeding the ineffectual Torleiv Hytten, and served from 1 July 1957 to 31 December 1967.
Sydney Sparkes Orr, who had been appointed, on the basis of falsified documents, Professor of Philosophy, University of Tasmania, in 1952 was sacked in 1955 for allegedly having sexual relations with a female undergraduate student, a celebrated and controversial case at the time. Orr sued for wrongful dismissal, and after having lost, appealed. Orr had a great number of supporters, and a great deal was published on both sides of the argument.
In an effort to clear the air, though having had no part in the sacking, Isles published a leaflet entitled "Dismissal of Sydney Sparkes Orr by the University of Tasmania" setting out the University's case, and was in 1961 sued by Orr for defamation, claiming £50,000 in damages as he had been unable to find employment for five years.
Recognition.
He was in 1967 conferred CMG
Family.
Isles married Irene Francis Clayton ( – ) at Jericho, Tasmania, near Oatlands, on 4 September 1926.
They had a daughter in Cambridge on 18 September 1928 and a son, John Isles of Hobart.

Joseph Bushnell Ames

Joseph Bushnell Ames (August 9, 1878 – June 20, 1928) was an American novelist during the early 20th century.
Early life.
Joseph Bushnell Ames was born on August 9, 1878, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, the son of Elias Hurlbut Ames (1851-1891) and Eleanor Gray Bushnell (1855-1946). Both Ames' father and maternal grandfather, Joseph Bushnell (1831–1918), came from old New England families and became wealthy during the Pennsylvania Oil Rush. Ames' great-grandfather was the Pittsburgh industrialist Daniel Bushnell. After Elias Ames' death of pneumonia in 1891 at age 39, Joseph's mother moved the family to Morristown, New Jersey, where her children had a privileged upbringing in the town that was then known as an "inland Newport.". Ames attended St. Mark's School and the Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating from the latter in 1901. Ames then worked as a mechanical engineer in Morristown, New Jersey for a time, until he quit that profession and began writing.
Career.
Ames wrote over a dozen novels, primarily Westerns, during the 1910s and 1920s. Some of his works, including the posthumously published "The Bladed Barrier", included fantasy themes. While Ames' books were set in the Western United States (the famous "Pete, cow-puncher - A Story of the Texas Plains", is one example), it is unclear whether he ever travelled there extensively. His novel "Shoe-Bar Stratton" was made into the 1922 Western film Catch My Smoke, directed by William Beaudine and featuring actors Tom Mix and Lillian Rich.
Personal life.
For most of his writing career Ames lived in "Willow Hall," a mansion on his estate, "Speedwell," in Morristown, New Jersey. The estate was the former residence of industrialist George Vail. Today the home is preserved as a historic site. Ames' brother Peter Ashmun Ames, to whom Joseph dedicated his 1921 novel "The Emerald Buddha," was an American intelligence officer and a member of the Cairo Gang. The philanthropist Mary Warden Harkness, wife of Charles W. Harkness, was a first cousin of Ames' mother Eleanor.

Burnt Wings (1920 film)

Burnt Wings is a 1920 American drama film directed by Christy Cabanne and starring Josephine Hill, Frank Mayo, and Rudolph Christians. It was released on March 29, 1920.
Plot.
Ned Templeton is a struggling artist in Paris. Their straits become even more dire when Ned is stricken down by illness. His doctor prescribes rest and good food, in addition to medication, to get him back to health. Without money his wife, Joan Templeton, is further threatened with eviction by their landlord, who suggests that there are relatively easy ways for a pretty young woman to make money. With no other alternative, Joan seeks out a wealthy benefactor, who she has an affair with in exchange for enough money to see her and Ned by, and Ned back to health.
Once he regains his health, he begins to become successful, and the couple returns to the United States, where his career really begins to take off. Helen Cartwright is impressed by his work, and convinces her father, James, to have his portrait done by Ned, and become his patron. When James realizes that Helen is in love with Ned, he also understands that the only thing standing in the way of his daughter's happiness is Joan. He uses his influence to add to Ned's success, as well as driving a wedge between Ned and Joan, who begin drifting apart, each thinking the other no longer cares. Ned and Helen begin to draw close to one another.
As a way to drive the final spike in her marriage, James approaches Joan and offers her a large sum of money to divorce Ned. Joan refuses, but James and her both realize that it was James who was her rich benefactor in Paris. Thinking he has the trump card, James goes back to Ned and tells him of Joan's infidelity in Paris. However, it does not have the effect that he had intended. Ned realizes what Joan sacrificed for him, and tells Helen he is returning to Joan. Helen understands, and Ned and Joan are reunited.
Production.
Bayard Veiller's play had premiered on Broadway in May 1907, and had been reprised during the 1919 season. The working title of the film was "The Primrose Path", the same as Veiller's play. In December 1919 it was announced that the play was being adapted for the screen by Universal. Initially, Lola Gonzales was tagged for the lead role of Joan Templeton. Gonzales was a professional model. However, a week later, it was announced that Josephine Hill had replaced Gonzales in the cast. At the same time it was announced that Frank Mayo, Mae Busch, Beatrice Burnham, and Rudolph Christians were also members of the cast. In early January 1920, the name was changed to "Burnt Wings". The picture wrapped filming by mid-February 1920. In February it was announced that the picture would be released on March 29, 1920.
Reception.
"Exhibitors Herald" gave the film a good review. They complimented both the production and the direction, and singled out the performances of Frank Mayo, Josephine Hill, and Betty Blythe. They were also complimentary of the writing work of Bayard Veiller. "Motion Picture News" gave the film a more average review, calling it "Just an ordinary program feature". They complimented the work of Mayo, Hill, and Blythe, and particularly highlighted the character work of Rudolph Christians. They felt the cinematography, direction, and settings were average. "The Moving Picture World" enjoyed the picture. While they did not care for the subject matter of the film, they felt the acting was very good. They felt Hill, though inexperienced, did quite well as Mayo's wife, and said that Blythe played her role "with charm". They were especially complimentary of Christians, in his role as the film's heavy. They particularly enjoyed the staging of the film, with "...some beautiful exteriors and interiors.

Juan Arvizu

Juan Nepomuceno Arvizu Santelices (known as Juan Arvizu; Santiago de Querétaro, May 22, 1900 - Mexico City, November 19, 1985), was an acclaimed lyric tenor in Mexico and a noted interpreter of the Latin American bolero and tango on the international concert stage, on the radio and in film. He was widely noted for his interpretations of the works of Agustin Lara and María Grever and was nicknamed "The Tenor With the Silken Voice".
Biography.
Early years.
Juan Nepomuceno Arvizu Santelices was born in Querétaro, Mexico, to Pedro Arvizu and Trinidad Santelices. As a child, he assisted his father as a radio-telegraph operator. His mother encouraged him to study vocalization, solfège and harmony while he sang in a children's choir. By the age of 22 he was accepted into the Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico) in Mexico City, where he continued his studies. His artistic abilities attracted the attention of several music teachers including José Pierson, who had instructed such noted vocalists as Jorge Negrete, José Mojica, Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, Pedro Vargas and Juan Pulido. Arvizu first appeared with Pierson's opera company while performing on stage with the noted soprano Ángeles Ottein and Consuelo Escobar.
At the age of 24, Arvizu made his debut at the Teatro Esperanza Iris with a role in "La sonámbula" by Vincenzo Bellini. As a member of the Consuelo Escobar de Castor Opera Company he continued in this role and traveled abroad. He visited New York City during this time and continued to augment his operatic repertoire to include the Argentine tango and the works of María Grever and Alfonso Esparza Oteo. By 1927, Arvizu returned to Mexico and appeared in another operatic production at the Teatro Esperanza Iris of Giacomo Meyerbeer's work "Dinorah".
While Arvizu's natural vocal qualities and the power of his operatic voice attracted the attention of the public, he faced financial obstacles in his professional endeavors at this time. With this in mind he increased his repertoire to include the popular tango and initiated appearances in cafes and cinemas. Pepe Cantillo, who directed one of the most famous music revues in Mexico soon engaged Arvizu. His performances in the opera house also attracted the attention of leading figures in the phonographic industry. At this time the popular music field welcomed such noted operatic artists as Margarita Cueto, Pedro Vargas, Juan Pulido, Carlos Mejía, Carlos Almenar Otero, Alfredo Sadel and Tito Schipa among others. Juan Arvizu was no exception, entrusting his voice to the Brunswick record label in 1928. His first recording of the song "Varita de nardo" by Joaquin Pardavé was well received among audiences. The RCA Victor record label soon included him on their staff, thereby beginning one of the most prolific careers in popular music. The composer Jorge del Moral entrusted his composition "Por Unos Ojos" to Arvizu, whose vocal versatility and musical qualities earned him the nickname "The Tenor With the Silken Voice".
International recognition.
Based upon these achievements, Radio XEW in Mexico invited Arvizu in 1930 to inaugurate its first broadcast in 1930. This would not be the only time that the "Tenor With the Silken Voice" would receive such recognition. In fact, Arvizu had the honor of initiating broadcasts on several other international radio stations. For example, in 1935, he inaugurated a show on LR1 - Radio El Mundo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Years later in 1942 he premiered with the Cadena de Las Amėricas of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and Voice of America on the "Viva América" show in New York, in collaboration with the orchestra conductor Alfredo Antonini, the Puerto Rican vocalist Elsa Miranda, the Argentine composer Terig Tucci, the Mexican American vocalist Eva Garza and the concert accordionist John Serry Sr. In 1941 he also collaborated with the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra in live performance on the radio for WABC in New York City. By 1945 his performances on the CBS network were heard by audiences in twenty Latin American nations and were rebroadcast for members of America's Armed forces on the Armed Forces Radio Service. His performances with the CBS Pan American Orchestra were also noteworthy for helping to introduce Latin American music and the Mexican bolero to large audiences in the United States during the 1940s. But one of his greatest achievements was to "discover" one of Mexico's leading composers, Agustín Lara in 1929.
During the 1920s and 1930s, the tango was very popular in Mexico. Arvizu premiered many of these songs in Pepe Cantillo's music revue. While searching for an accompanist, the tenor agreed to hire an unknown bohemian pianist at the ordinary Café Salambó. That pianist was Agustín Lara. At first, Agustín Lara was a tango composer, but his compositions lacked the proper accompaniment of the tango orchestra. As a result, his works were classified within the "creole song" genre. Arvizu was the first singer to champion Lara's compositions through his performances in cinemas and on the radio. The performances of the Lara-Arvizu duo on radio XEW were well received by the public. Along with other leading vocalists of the time such as Pedro Vargas and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, Arvizu helped to popularize several of Lara's greatest compositions. They included such works as: "Aventura", "Concha Nacar", "Cuando Vuelvas", "Enamorada", "Granada", "Santa" and "Tus Pupilas".
Juan Arvizu achieved international recognition in the 1930s. By 1935, the singer made his first international tour and arrived in Buenos Aires for the launching of the LR1 Radio El Mundo. While his stay in Buenos Aires was scheduled for only two months, it lasted for over a year and a half. It was a triumphant season for Juan Arvizu. This feat would be repeated years later when he finished his contract in New York with RCA Victor. He stayed in Argentina for 18 years and launched many concert tours abroad from this venue.
The zenith of Juan Arvizu's career emerged in 1944. In Argentina alone, the singer earned $60,000. Audiences flocked to the stages and concert venues where Juan Arvizu appeared. He lived for several years in Chile while performing boleros as well as in Colombia.
Upon returning to his native Mexico, however, Juan failed to receive the recognition which he had expected. With the passage of time, a new generation had emerged with different musical preferences. Juan had been pushed into the background. After a long tour in his native town of Queretáro, Mexico in 1967, he embarked upon a period of rest since his life had been characterized by continuous movement.
Recordings.
Juan Arvizu was one of the most recorded singers in the history of Latin music. As a prolific performer, he recorded for several leading labels including: RCA Victor, Columbia Records and Tico Records. He often premiered compositions by several prominent Latin composers including: Mario Clavell from Argentina, Rafael Hernández Marín from Puerto Rico, Donato Roman Heitman from Chile, Enrique Fábrega from Panama, Carlos Vieco, Augusto Duque from Colombia, and Agustín Lara, Gonzalo Curiel and Gabriel Ruiz Galindo from Mexico.
Arvizu also performed in duo with other noted musicians. His recordings with Margarita Cueto include several famous songs such as: "Taboga", "Más Vale Tarde Que Nunca," "Bajo el Palmar," "Deseparacíon," among many others. With Juan Pulido he recorded "El Último Beso" and with Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, "Negra Linda". Arvizu was also accompanied by several renowned orchestras of his time including: Marimba Panamerica, the Chucho Zarzosa Orchestra, the Vieri Fidanzani Orchestra, the Francisco Lomuto Orchestra, the E. Vigil and Robles Orchestra, the Orchestra of Juan S. Garrido, the CBS Pan American Orchestra, and many others.
Juan Arvizu is credited with several single recordings of boleros, aires, tangos, waltzes and milongas. It has been estimated that during the course of his career he recorded over 2,000 discs. Among some of the most popular titles are his interpretations of: "Arrepentimiento" "Cada Vez Que Me Recuerdes", "Corrientes y Esmeralda", "Qué Fácil Es Decir", "La Cumparsita", "Lágrimas de Sangre", "Madreselva Caminito", "Mi Buenos Aires Querido", "Mi Único Amor", "Nido Gaucho", " No Cantes Ese Tango", "Nuestra Casita", "Pecado", "Plegaria", "Prohibido", " Salud Dinero y Amor", " Señior Juez", "Si Dejaras de Quererme", "Sinceramente", "Tengo Mil Novias", "Verdemar", "Una Cación".
"Serpentina Doble".
Among the many songs showcased by Arvizu is the composition "Serpentina Doble" by Juan Rezzano. The song tells the tale of a boy who was selling colored strips of paper and subsequently suffers a fatal accident caused by a vehicle which is driven by a pierrot at a carnival. The boy passes away in a hospital just as the carnival also comes to an end. The composer of the song is said to have heard his father singing the beautiful melody at home when he was very young.
Cinema.
The "Seventh Art" also benefited from the presence of Juan Arvizu. He participated in several films including "Santa" and "Reír llorando", which were produced in Mexico. In Cuba, Arvizu starred in the most important film of his career "Ahora Seremos Felices" with the charismatic Puerto Rican artist Mapy Cortés. By 1939, Arvizu had already reached the zenith of his fame. Even though the plot of the film was simple, it generated fabulous revenues. Arvizu sang several boleros by the composer Rafael Hernández including: "Quiero Decirte", "Las Palomitas", "Purísima" and "Ahora Seremos Felices". In 1940 he also sang in the film "Infidelidad" in collaboration with the actor Jorge Vélez. In the 1950s he performed in several biographical films about the composer María Grever including: "Cuando Me Vaya" (1954) 
which earned two Ariel Awards and "O Grande Amor De María Grever 1954 Leg" (1954).
Performance style.
During the course of his long career recording music for the Victor label, Arvizu's performances were reviewed by critics in such leading magazines as "The Billboard". He was consistently praised for a passionate delivery as well as a dramatic style of chanting. He was also applauded for his full bodied chanting and the full tonal quality of his voice.
Death.
Juan Arvizu died in Mexico City November 19, 1985. His musical legacy includes a compendium of single recordings for RCA Victor, Columbia Records and Tico Records some of which were produced in both North and South America. They embody an extensive repertoire which includes the music of his fellow Mexican artists Agustín Lara and María Grever. He is recognized as one of the leading Mexican tenors of his era who championed the compositions of Agustín Lara.

<doc id="56761335" url="?curid=56761335" title="Graphene helix">
Graphene helix

A graphene helix, similar to the carbon nanotube, is a structure consisting of a two-dimensional sheet of graphene wrapped into a helix. These graphene sheets can have multiple layers, called multi-walled carbon structures, that add to these helixes thus increasing their tensile strength but increasing the difficulty of manufacturing. Using van der Waals interactions it can make structures within one another. By using these graphene sheets in this way it becomes possible to create the perfect material, with microscopic size, immense tensile strength, and thermal and electrical conductivity. With these physical properties, its applications into nanotechnologies are seemingly limitless, where it can be used to help sequence DNA to be used in small scale semiconductors. In the model, the one-dimensional materials are resulted from spiral growth of a graphene ribbon, like an ivy growing on a tree in nature, resulting in a helically opened, tube-like structure.
Electrical and magnetic properties.
Electrical.
Graphene has very promising electrical properties. Carbon nanotubes are semimetals meaning they are either metallic or semiconducting along the helical axis, this can depend on the curvature of the graphene helix. On top of having both of these properties graphene has a unique and useful is that it is a "zero-overlap semimetal". Carbon helixes allow high electrical transfer over a three-dimensional plane. With the tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal management it is the perfect material for biotechnologies.
Magnetic.
Similar to the electrical properties electrical fields can be used on a graphene sheet to polarize the bonds and exclusively bond on one side of the graphene sheet.
Thermal.
Graphene is a great thermal conductor, but this is paired with being a great insulator perpendicular to the helical axis. These graphene sheets have a thermal conductivity of 3500 W·m−1·K−1, where copper has one of only 385 W·m−1·K−1 .
Physical properties.
With the different electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties shows that graphene by itself has many unique characteristics that can be harvested when used as a three dimensional structure. These graphene sheets have a tensile strength of 130,000,000,000 pascals which when compared to 400,000,000 pascals that of industrial steel. This shows the possibilities of what this substance can be used for. Graphene is light when compared to materials like industrial steel because it weighs 0.77 milligrams per square meter. Each of these sheets of graphene are made by single atom wide carbon chains cross linking. These webs of carbon chains look like pages of two dimensional hexagons with the only third dimension being only a single atom wide.
Production.
Early synthesis of graphene.
One of the first ways that graphene was discovered was taking a piece of masking tape and placing it on a piece of carbon and pulling it off to reveal many small two dimensional graphene sheets. By fabricating graphene with tape does it does create the necessary conditions for these graphene sheets to have the tensile strength previously stated.
Mass production of graphene.
The practicality of using tape to separate these sheets from each other does not scale to the production that would be necessary with the new developments of graphene. This becomes a new issue as the quality of the sheets completely determines what can be done with them. At a larger scale graphene can come from chemically exfoliated, natural, mined graphite.
Production of graphene helixes.
Arc discharge and laser ablation.
These two slightly different processes both have graphene being combusted with electrical currents or by a laser and the graphene helixes will develop when the gaseous phases are separated, but there will need to be excess metals as catalysts.
Chemical vapor deposition.
Viewed as a process that has the most promise for the future the graphene helixes can be formed as catalysts are pushed onto the graphene sheets and will create the emerging helix. While needed to be performed at high temperatures the process can easily be activated and deactivated purely by the development of the helical structure.
Medical applications.
Sequencing.
One of the most interesting applications of a graphene helix would be new ways of unwinding RNA and DNA and using graphene helix's to image these folded apart strands for further sequencing. Having these RNA and XNA bonds pulled apart inside of these graphene helix structures causes the hydrogen bonds to stay intact for more nanoseconds than previously so the sequencing would be more intact. The graphene helix was allowing the XNA to keep its three dimensional structure and allows for the hydrogen bonds to last longer. Overall the thermal and electrical conductivity of these carbon structures has too many different uses because of their strength and weight.
Electrocapillary.
Helical graphene tubes have the electrical and physical properties and in addition to the elasticity can fit into smaller capillary systems. These graphene helixes potentially can be used in nano-fluid systems with uses of both actuators and fiber shaped sensors.
Future outlook.
These carbon helixes display very advantageous physical properties that make the creation of nanostructures more of a possibility. With possibilities in the 3D printing field of nanotechnologies, they could be providing the scaffolding for future supercapacitors, implants, and energy storage. As the world is decreasing everything in size, computers are the fastest to take advantage of new materials, by miniaturizing more electronics even down the basic wire carrying electricity. There already have been logic gates made by these carbon structures showing the future potential in such material.
Nodal morphology.
Lee et al. suggested unique "nodal morphology" as evidence for the helix model for SWNTs, which prevails in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images reported since 1993. The helix model for SWNTs is supported by strain energy calculation. The strain energy of the helical growth of a zigzag or armchair graphene ribbon is just about a quarter that of seamless cylindrical SWNTs. This calculation suggests that the growth of seamless SWNTs may be energetically prohibitive and uncompetitive with the structure proposed here under the conditions of conventional chemical vapor deposition processes.
The model addresses previous experimental evidence in the literature, diverse electron diffraction patterns, HRTEM and STM morphologies as well as inconsistencies in the measured mechanical and electrical properties of SWNTs. Electrical property of SWNTs can be regarded as a (zigzag) graphene nanoribbon which is a conductor. In the mode, the chirality is not a necessary condition for the growth of SWNTs and the observation of chirality (or semiconducting properties) in the literature may be the result of an erroneous interpretation of the distortion of the graphene helix.
Based on spiral growth model, further works were carried out to investigate the mechanical properties (evaluation of tensile process by stress distribution).
Recently, Park et al. reinterpreted SWNTs to be a graphene helix via Raman spectroscopy, showing that the typical Raman spectrum for SWNTs is the signature of their helical structure with density functional theory simulation and structure analysis for hydrogenated and dehydrogenated SWNTs samples. They demonstrated that the G- mode at ~1570 cm-1 is unique to opened tubular graphene structures (i.e., graphene helix) of ~2 nm in diameter. They also demonstrate that D mode of ~1350 cm-1 is originated from edge defects of opened SWNTs revealing strong Eigenvectors, which is absent in concentric tubes. They also showed that the analysis for the Raman spectra of SWNTs is consistent with general understanding on Raman analysis of carbon materials.

Alice Blue Gown

Alice Blue Gown is a popular song written by Joseph McCarthy and Harry Tierney. The song, which was inspired by Alice Roosevelt Longworth's signature gown, was first performed by Edith Day in the 1919 Broadway musical "Irene". In 1920 the song was recorded and released.
Artists who have recorded the song include Duke Ellington, Martha Wainwright, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Glenn Miller, Wayne King, Frank Sinatra, Chet Atkins and Lenny Breau. Carol Burnett sang the song as a spoof while wearing a fatsuit in the opening number on her variety show of the same name on March 29, 1975.
The song is about Irene's favourite dress which she wore until it was worn out, and begins:
I once had a gown it was almost new&lt;br&gt;

HMS Shamrock (1812)

HMS "Shamrock" was a "Bold"-class gun-brig launched in 1812. In 1813-14 she played an important role in the captures of Cuxhaven and Glückstadt. After the war she became a survey vessel, and then a quarantine ship. She was delivered to the Coast Guard in 1833 as a watch vessel and was re-designated WV18 in 1863. She was sold in 1867.
Wartime service.
Commander Andrew Pellet Green's commission as commander was dated 1 February 1812. He commissioned "Shamrock" in November.
"Shamrock" initially served on the Downs station. In April 1813 she was placed under the orders of Captain M'Kerlie of the Heligoland squadron.
Green sailed "Shamrock" to Cuxhaven where he took command of a squadron comprising , , , , and gun-boats No.s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10. The British vessels had come to support the Russian troops under Colonel Alexander Radlinger, who were besieging the town.
Captain Arthur Farquhar in arrived at Cuxhaven from Bremerlehe on 28 November to take command of the squadron that Captain Greene had gathered.
The two key French positions were the forts Napoleon and Phare. While the gunboats fired on Phare, the British landed a number of guns and established a battery of six 18-pounders, two 32-pounders, and two 6-pounders. Before the battery could start firing on the 30th, the French surrendered both forts. The French surrendered 26 heavy guns, two 13" mortars, and a blockhouse with a garrison of three hundred men and officers, all of whom became prisoners of war.
On 11 November 1813 Commander John Marshall assumed command of "Shamrock" He joined her off Cuxhaven. Green was appointed to command , but delayed, remaining with Farquhar as a volunteer. He was made a knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order and the Swedish Order of the Sword for his services at Cuxhaven.
Marshall received orders to proceed further up the Elbe with the gun-boats. The flotilla's objective was to watch the French at Gluckstadt until the arrival there of the Swedish troops under the Baron de Boyé.
From late December 1813 Farquhar's squadron, comprising "Desiree", "Hearty", "Blazer", "Piercer", "Shamrock", "Redbreast", and eight gun-boats (the seven from Cuxhaven plus No. 12), supported Swedish forces under the command of General Baron de Boye against the Danes in the attack on the town and fortress of Glückstadt at the Elbe river during the War of the Sixth Coalition.
The British arrived on 23 December and by 25 December had erected a battery of two 32-pounder guns. (They had landed six but the poor quality of the roads meant that only two were in place.) To support the bombardment on the next day, Farquhar sent in the gunboats and the brigs, whose armament he had reinforced with two 18-pounders each from "Desiree". The bombardment continued to the 28th. Glückstadt having failed to surrender, Farquhar established three more batteries, one of two 18-pounders, one of four 32-pounders, and one of the two 13" mortars captured at Cuxhaven. An English rocket brigade under Lieutenant Amherst Wright contributed to the bombardment. These batteries commenced bombarding the town on 1 January 1814, keeping it up for the next two days. On 4 January Farquhar sent in a flag of truce, and after negotiations, the governor surrendered on 5 January. British casualties overall were light; none were from "Shamrock".
The Swedish troops arrived on 5 January 1814 and four days later Marshall entered the harbour at Gluckstadt where he took possession of the Danish flotilla of one brig and seven gunboats.
Marshall then was despatched to Kiel to establish the squadron's claims to the enemy's vessels, stores, etc. captured on the Elbe. When the ice broke up, "Shamrock" moved to Cuxhaven where she remained. However, her only Lieutenant, James Edgecombe, took command of six gunboats and assisted at the blockades of Hamburg and Haarburg.
Marshall received promotion to post captain on 7 June 1814. He was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Knight of the highest Russian Military Order of St. George, and knight of the Swedish order of the Sword.
On 15 July 1816 there was a first payment of £5000 in prize money to the navy for the capitulation of Glückstadt. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Gluckstadt 5 Jany. 1814" to all surviving claimants from the action.
Commander Christopher Askew commanded "Shamrock" from June 1814 on the Irish station. She was paid off into ordinary in October 1815 at Plymouth.
Post-war.
Between November 1816 and February 1817, "Shamrock" underwent fitting at Plymouth for a survey vessel. Commander Martin White commissioned her in May for surveying in the Channel. She proceeded to survey the coasts of England, Ireland, Jersey, and Guernsey.
On 22 October 1820 "Shamrock" was caught in a gale at St Helen's Pople, Scilly. She had to cut away both her masts.
Commander Martin left "Shamrock" in 1828. She was at Woolwich in 1829 where between September 1830 and 1831 she underwent fitting as a quarantine ship.
Coast Guard.
The Admiralty delivered "Shamrock" in March 1833 to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard then used her as a watch vessel at Rochester, Kent. On 25 May 1863 the Coastguard re-designated "Shamrock" "WV 18".
Fate.
"Shamrock"s sale was reported on 24 January 1867.

Shaun Pianta

Shaun Pianta (born 24 February 1989) is a B2 classified visually impaired Para-alpine skier from Australia. His guide in 2018 is Jeremy O'Sullivan. He represented Australia at the 2018 Winter Paralympics.
Personal.
Pianta was born in Collie, Western Australia on 24 February 1989. In 2008, whilst holidaying in Bali, he contracted a superbug virus that attacked his optic nerve. He was flown back to Perth, Western Australia and whilst in hospital suffered kidney failure. The virus left him with only 15 per cent of his vision. He is a qualified boiler maker and welder and has a Certificate in Business. 
Skiing.
Prior to his loss of vision, he was an avid snowboarder. He took up Para-alpine skiing in 2012 after a Disabled Wintersport Australia expo in Melbourne. In December 2014, he broke both legs in a training run and spent three months in a wheelchair. At the 2017 World Para-alpine Skiing Europa Cup event in Veysonnaz, Switzerland, Pianta and his guide Jeremy O'Sullivan won silver medals in the men’s vision impaired super-G and giant slalom. He competed in the men's slalom and giant slalom at the 2017 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships but failed to finish in both events.
On 17 January 2018, he suffered a slight anterior cruciate ligament tear. Deciding against surgery, he undertook an intensive and highly structured rehabilitation process, including three weeks based at the Australian Institute of Sport. 
On 6 March 2018, Pianta and sighted guide Jeremy O'Sullivan were selected in the Australian team to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics but he will be required to pass a final fitness test on his injured right knee ahead of his Paralympic debut on March 14. At the 2018 Winter Paralympics, Pianta competed in two events - 14th in the Men's Giant Slalom Visually Impaired and did not finish in the Men's Slalom Visually Impaired.

Melba Liston and Her 'Bones

Melba Liston and Her 'Bones is the sole album led by trombonist, arranger and composer Melba Liston, recorded for the MetroJazz label in 1958.
Reception.
The All About Jazz review by Hrayr Attarian states: "Melba Liston is best known as an arranger and composer, thanks to her associations with Dizzy Gillespie and subsequently Randy Weston. But she was a virtuoso trombone player as well. ... The leader's interplay with the other trombone players adds to the musical richness of the recording. Even in the company of high-quality, accomplished master musicians like these, her musical skills stand out. Her lyrical improvisations are melodic, clear and gay when she plays unmuted, and mysterious and warm when muted. This recording is one of the few places to hear Melba Liston solo".

Robert Grant Ranch

The Robert Grant Ranch was established in 1891 in Platte County, Wyoming by Scottish immigrant Robert Grant. The ranch represents a complete homestead with a representative collection of buildings and structures associated with a self-sufficient ranching operation in Wyoming. Robert Grant was born in 1847 in Motherwell, Scotland. He married Margaret Grant in Bellish in 1867, where Robert was a coal miner. The Grants emigrated to the United States in 1878 with their sons Tom and Robert, Jr. to join some of Margaret's family members in Wyoming. They established a homestead, which they sold in 1884. Their new home became the Grant Ranch. After establishing an irrigation system the family built a permanent house in 1890. After 1900 Margaret and Robert retired to Wheatland, and the ranch was taken over by their daughter Clara and son Duncan, both born after the move to Wyoming. After marrying, Duncan took over ranch operations and was eventually joined by son Robert Grant III.
Significant ranch structures include the wood and stone main house (1891-94), a stone outhouse (c. 1890), a stone chicken house (c. 1890), a dipping vat (c. 1910), a lime kiln (c. 1890), and irrigation structures. Later additions included a bunkhouse/schoolhouse (c. 1917), a brooder house (c. 1930), a coal shed (moved to the ranch c. 1920) and a playhouse from another site. The main house is a 1-1/2 story house measuring about by , with a hipped roof. The walls are thick local limestone covered with lime and sand stucco. A kitchen addition is by .
The Robert Grant Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 7, 1995.

NERA Economic Consulting

NERA Economic Consulting, Inc., or National Economic Research Associates, is an economic consulting firm founded in 1961. It was the first consulting firm dedicated to methodically applying microeconomic theory to litigation and regulatory matters. The firm applies econometric and statistical analysis to provide strategy, studies, reports, expert testimony, and policy recommendations for government authorities, law firms, and corporations.
The company is based in the United States and has offices in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. NERA employs more than 500 professionals, most of whom have advanced degrees in economics, finance, law or business.
NERA is a part of the Oliver Wyman Group, a subsidiary of the Marsh and McLennan Companies, a global professional services firm.
Recognition.
NERA ranked second in Vault's 2018 survey of the top firms in economic consulting. "The" "New York Times" called it "one of the country’s oldest and best-known economic consultancies." Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, said that NERA is "one of the world’s foremost economic consultancies."
In June 2017, President Donald Trump cited statistics from a study by NERA in a speech announcing his plan to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement. The study, which was prepared to measure the economic impact of hypothetical regulatory actions necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, was criticized for overestimating the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In a response, NERA said that the Trump Administration selectively used results of the study that mischaracterized its purpose and analysis.

Alper was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl. When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since. As a child, Alper had a phobia of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous. By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety.
Alper's parents hired visual artist Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art. The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud nonsense verse by Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. She worked with a variety of media, and introduced Alper to papier-mâché (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later). They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form.
Alper later attended an alternative school in Highland Park. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist Harry Burnett. Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled. "I made really intricate marionettes that took me months to finish," Alper recalls. "I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them."
In 1976, Alper enrolled at Immaculate Heart College, a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her. In 1978 she transferred to Los Angeles City College, where she continued her education in art until 1983. In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a mental breakdown and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words. Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for electroconvulsive therapy, which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged.
Through all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Dorothy Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999. When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand. Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of Occidental College. She also approached Bolivian-American painter Tom Wudl. Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. "Tom promised me that we are creativity itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again," Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge. Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years.
Among Alper's art media are oil and acrylic paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study wood carving. She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children.
Career.
Teaching.
Alper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995. In the late 1970s she was a teaching assistant at Area H Alternative School, one of the first alternative schools in Los Angeles. In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to terminally ill teenagers at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
It was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, Catherine Coulson (the "Log Lady" of "Twin Peaks"), became one of her students, and also a good friend. "I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected," Coulson explains. During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with Kristine McKenna. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage.
Susan Arnold, a film producer and casting director, also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing "Benny &amp; Joon" (1993), she arranged for Alper to help Mary Stuart Masterson prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a mime artist.
Alper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the California Institute of the Arts, for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there.
Exhibitions.
From 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a performance art and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded. In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal "Fiberarts". She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of Highland Park in 1988, she returned for a solo show in 1994, called "Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s. Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of Oakland in 1989. Rosamund Felsen Gallery of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013.
The 2006 and 2007 shows demonstrated Alper's drawings in ink and marker pen. In 2013, she exhibited alongside abstractionist painter Marcia Roberts. Alper's exhibit featured more than 20 pieces, including papier-mâché sculpture and ink drawing. In 2016 the gallery closed its space on Santa Fe Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, and has operated as a website since then. The gallery's final group show, Celebration (2016), included three untitled Alper drawings in ink and marker pen.
Illustration.
Chamber musician Jay Hosler is the nephew of Dorothy Cannon, Alper's mentor, and has known Alper since she was about five years old. When he and fellow musician Peggy Harrison began writing children's literature together, Alper agreed to illustrate their first story: a chapter book called "Norm and Burny: The Black Square". "The Black Square" was published in 2013, and it includes 23 drawings. Its sequel, "The Girl with the Gold Coin" (2014), is also illustrated by Alper. In the books, Norm is a 12-year-old boy who goes on adventures with his (somewhat wiser) canine companion, Burny.
Content.
Alper's work is representational. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises line drawings and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of the unconscious. Her figures are human (or humanoid), and sometimes anthropomorphic. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had "an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view"; she described Alper's memory as "photographic". Journalist and art curator Kristine McKenna esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as "remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity". Writing in 2018, film critic Richard Brody was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be "brilliant [and] moving".
During a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: "I was very prolific with my drawing," Alper says, "and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate."
Documentary.
While studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, Frank Stiefel, was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings. He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental bust of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson. After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged. The film, "Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405", premiered at the Austin Film Festival in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the "Documentary Short" category. The Jury Award qualified the film for an Academy Award nomination. At the 90th Academy Awards in 2018, it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).

Asphyxia (author)

Asphyxia is a Deaf Australian artist, writer, activist and public speaker. Formerly a puppeteer, she is the author of the children's series "The Grimstones", which won the APA Book Design Awards Best Designed Children's Series in 2013.
Life and career.
She was born in Melbourne, the eldest of eight children, being nicknamed Asphyxia by one of her brothers when she was a teenager. Being the eldest, and creative from a young age, she took it upon herself to create magical words of mystical creatures in which she enrolled her younger siblings and cousins to be a part. She attended a hearing school, and did not learn Auslan until she was 18, as her parents wanted her to have a high standard of education, and were not satisfied with the standard of the education for the deaf.
As a child, she had dreams of being a ballerina, but they disintegrated once it became clear her deafness prohibited this as a professional career, and after the Australian Ballet School turned her down because of her deafness. Instead, once she left school, she turned to circus, joining Circus Oz, specialising in the trapeze and hula-hoops. Here she discovered she could incorporate her deafness into her work rather than trying to hide it, realising it could enhance what she did. One of the ways she did this was by signing karaoke, which was a big success with her audiences.
Towards the end of her career in Circus Oz, Asphyxia discovered puppetry through Sergio Barrio, a master puppeteer, whom she discovered when overseas touring with Circus Oz, and begged him to teach her his craft. She then leapt into it whole heartedly, learning how to make her own puppets and sets for them. After some experimentation, she ended up with a gothic family which she named "The Grimstones". She then left the circus to travel around Australia performing with her puppets, which was a big success, and captivated children and adults alike. 
After a couple of years of touring with her puppet family, Asphyxia got a call from the publishers Allen &amp; Unwin, who told her that someone had thought that The Grimstones would make a great book. She embraced the idea, as she had always had aspirations to be an author, entering her first book when she was 12 in the St Kilda Writer's Festival where it won first place. In February 2012 she published the first of four, "Hatched". The next three in the series "Mortimer Revealed" (April 2012), "Whirlwind" (December 2012) and "Music School" (December 2013) soon followed. "Future Girl" (August 2020) won the 2021 Readings Young Adult Book Prize.
Asphyxia currently lives in a small cottage she built herself when she was just 22, with her partner and son. She enjoys painting and other forms of artwork, which she shares with the world through her blog. She is focused on raising her son, and living sustainably, and owns chickens and other animals.

Fred Laws

Frederick Arthur Laws (21 July 1877 – 1 April 1954) was a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Wellington in New Zealand from 1897 to 1910, and one match for Hawke's Bay in 1898.
An opening bowler and middle-order batsman, Laws's best performance came in Wellington's match against the touring MCC in 1906-07. He took five wickets in the drawn match, showing a "promising turn of speed", and top-scored for Wellington with 47 with some bold stroke play. After he retired from playing he became an umpire, standing in one Plunket Shield match in 1912-13.

2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying

The qualifying phase of the 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League was a one-off tournament that took place from 6 September 2018 to 24 March 2019. The qualifying determined the seeding for the group phase of the inaugural tournament, as well as determining the remaining ten teams that qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup.
Format.
Apart from the six teams which participated in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying hexagonal, the other 34 teams (Guatemala could not enter due to FIFA suspension after missing the deadline of 1 March 2018) entered qualifying. Subsequently, each team played four matches, two home and two away. Based on their results, the teams were divided into tiers for the group phase of the inaugural edition of the CONCACAF Nations League:
Moreover, the top ten teams qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup to join the six hexagonal participants.
Tiebreakers.
The ranking of teams in qualifying was determined as follows:
Seeding.
The 34 teams were seeded into four pots based on their position in the March 2018 CONCACAF Ranking Index (shown in parentheses). Pots A and D contained 8 teams, while pots B and C contained 9 teams. Teams in bold qualified for the final tournament.
Schedule and match pairings.
The order of the match pairings per each FIFA match window was as follows:
The draw of the qualifying fixtures was held on 7 March 2018, 10:00 EST (), at The Temple House in Miami Beach, Florida, United States, directly after the launch event of the CONCACAF Nations League. A computerized pre-draw produced a "master schedule", creating 17 fixtures for each matchday. The teams in each pot were then drawn to the corresponding positions in the schedule (A1–A8, B1–B9, C1–C9, D1–D8). The computer model assured that no teams face each other more than once, and that each team plays two home and two away matches.
The result of the draw was as follows:
Summary.
!colspan=3|Matchday 1
!colspan=3|Matchday 2
!colspan=3|Matchday 3
!colspan=3|Matchday 4
Matches.
The match dates were announced on 29 May 2018, with the venues announced in August and September 2018. The March 2019 match schedule was revised by CONCACAF in January 2019.
Times in September, October and March are Eastern Daylight Time (), while times in November are Eastern Standard Time (), as listed by CONCACAF. If the venue was located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.
Qualified teams for CONCACAF Gold Cup.
At the end of the CONCACAF Nations League qualifying, the top ten teams qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup together with the six participants of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying Hexagonal (with their Gold Cup qualification confirmed at the draw of CONCACAF Nations League qualifying on 7 March 2018).

List of bolides in 2017

The following is a list of bolides and fireballs seen on Earth in 2017. These are small asteroids (known as meteoroids) that regularly impact the Earth. Although most are so small that they burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, some larger objects may reach the surface as fragments, known as meteorites.
Meteors with a recorded absolute magnitude are then converted to an asteroidal absolute magnitude under (Ma = Mm + 31) and then converted to a diameter assuming that meteoroids brighten by approximate 10 magnitudes when entering the atmosphere. Objects reported only to the American Meteor Society are only listed if observed by at least 10 people, and are cross-referenced with https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov if possible, to determine further physical characteristics. The fourth and third to last parameters are calculated from http://convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html, assuming a density of 1.5 g/cm^3, an impact angle of 45°, and a velocity of 17 km/s (if not provided). The actual values for both may vary by as much as the value itself, so be aware that these values are only estimates.

McKeesport Transportation Center

The McKeesport Transportation Center is a bus, and formerly train, station located in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.
History.
The station was served by the PATrain commuter rail service between Versailles and Pittsburgh, and its predecessor, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad operated Pittsburgh - Mckeesport - Versailles commuter service. Amtrak's "Capitol Limited" began stopping in McKeesport in 1982.
PATrain service was discontinued in April 1989, and replaced by an express bus service from McKeesport. The "Capitol Limited" ceased to stop in 1991, and in the months prior an average of one passenger boarded at McKeesport per journey.
The McKeesport Transportation Center has remained the primary transit hub of the greater McKeesport area. In response to significant cutbacks to routes in the region by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, Heritage Community Transportation began serving the station in 2014.
In 2017 the complex underwent a $1 million redevelopment, which included demolition of aging structures, new road and parking surfaces, Port Authority driver rest facilities and new shelters.
Services.
The McKeesport Transportation Center is currently served by the Port Authority of Allegheny County and Heritage Community Transportation.
The current Port Authority routes are the 56 Lincoln Place, 6 
61C McKeesport-Homestead and P7 McKeesport Flyer. A number of additional routes stop kerbside on Lyle Boulevard. The current Heritage route serves a number of adjacent communities.
Facilities.
There is a park and ride lot by the station.

Adina Apartment Hotels is a hospitality brand originating from Australia, and a subsidiary of TFE Hotels. The brand was established as part of the Toga Group's (now TFE Hotels) expansion into Europe, and was later applied to the company's hotels in Australia. As of 2018, 32 Adina Apartment Hotels are operational in Australia, Europe and New Zealand.
History.
In 1998 the Toga Group opened the first Adina Apartment Hotel in Budapest. This was an expansion of their Australian operations, which comprised the Medina and Vibe chains. Adina was the first Australian-owned apartment hotel chain in Europe. The decision to expand into Europe was driven by an assessment by Toga Group's owners that while there was little scope to open further apartment hotels in Australia, the market for this kind of accommodation in Europe was immature.
In November 2005, Toga was seeking to establish a $A134 million fund to open further Adina hotels in Europe, and partly fund an expansion in Australia. At this time, Toga Group was to manage the hotels and own 25% of the units of the fund. An Adina hotel was also scheduled to open in Copenhagen in December 2005. By February 2009 the chain comprised three hotels in Budapest, Copenhagen and Berlin. A further four hotels were under construction: two in Berlin, and one each in Hamburg and Frankfurt.
In March 2014 the Toga Group changed its name to Toga Far East Hotels after establishing a joint venture with the Singaporean company Far East Hospitality. At this time there were seven Adina Hotels in Europe, and "The Australian" reported that the joint venture may provide funding for further expansion. The 'Adina' name was being applied to all of the company's apartment hotels worldwide, with the 'Medina' brand being used for serviced apartments.
As of March 2018, there were 20 Adina apartment hotels in Australia, 11 in Europe and one in New Zealand. Further Adina Apartment Hotels are planned, including the first to open in the United Kingdom. In 2017, TFE Hotels was also planning to establish a brand of luxury hotels to be called "Adina Grand".

Get Those Elephants Out'a Here

Get Those Elephants Out'a Here is an album by The Mitchells: Whitey Mitchell Red Mitchell and Blue Mitchell, with André Previn recorded for the MetroJazz label in 1958.
Reception.
The AllMusic review by Ken Dryden states: "Bassist Whitey Mitchell is the leader of this fascinating 1958 studio session, which features his better-known older brother, Red Mitchell, on piano and bass, trumpeter Blue Mitchell (no relation), pianist André Previn, baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, trombonist Frank Rehak, and drummer Frank Capp. One of just two dates recorded as a leader by Whitey Mitchell prior to his early retirement from jazz, there are plenty of inspired moments on this date".
Track listing.
"All compositions by Red Mitchell, except where indicated."

Diuris brevifolia

Diuris brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved donkey orchid, is a species of orchid which is endemic to South Australia. It has a few narrow, twisted leaves and a flowering stem with up to five bright yellow flowers with brown markings and relatively large, spreading lobes on the labellum. This is a relatively late-flowering species of donkey orchid.
Description.
"Diuris brevifolia" is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and eight, often twisted leaves which are long and wide. Up to five bright yellow flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. There are two brown spots on the base of the dorsal sepal and the labellum callus is outlined in brown. The dorsal sepal is erect or bent upwards, long, wide. The lateral sepals are greenish, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and turn downwards, more or less parallel to each other. The petals are erect or curved backwards, have a dark brown stalk long with a blade long and wide. The labellum is egg-shaped, long and wide with side lobes long and about wide. There are two parallel ridge-like calli about long near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to December.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris brevifolia" was first formally described in 1922 by Richard Sanders Rogers who published his description in "Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia". The specific epithet ("brevifolia") is derived from the Latin words "brevis" meaning "short" and "folia" meaning "leaves".
Distribution and habitat.
The short-leaved donkey orchid grows in a variety of habitats including heath, forest and woodland but is most common around the edges of swamps and river flats. It only occurs to the south of Adelaide and on Kangaroo Island.
Conservation.
There has been a large decline in the distribution and abundance of this donkey orchid in recent years and is listed as "endangered" in South Australia. The main threats to the species are incompatible land use and infrequent fire.

Humeima

Humayma, also spelled Humeima and Humaima (), is the modern name of ancient Hawara. Hawara was a trading post in southern Jordan that was founded by the Nabataean king Aretas III in the early first century BC. It is located 45 km to the south of the Nabataean capital Petra and 55 km to the north of the Red Sea port town of Aqaba.
History.
Humeima was occupied from about 90 BC until the Early Islamic period, and has Nabataean, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic remains, including a Roman bath and fort, five Byzantine churches, and a "qasr" or fortified palace from the Umayyad Period.
Nabataean and Roman periods.
The settlement was founded by Aretas III as a stop on the trade route from Petra to Gulf of Aqaba. During the Greco-Roman era, it was called "Auara" (), derived from "Hawara", which means "white" in Aramaic.
Umayyad period.
The town was the home of the Abbasid, or Banu Abbas family, around AD 700, who eventually overthrew the Umayyad dynasty and took over the title of caliph, and as such it was the birthplace of the first three Abbasid caliphs: As-Saffah (r. 750–754), Al-Mansur (r. 754–775) and Al-Mahdi (r. 775–785). The family residence of the Abbasids was a large "qasr" a roughly square plan, approximately 61 by 50 m, with a recessed entrance facing east, and a large central court, arguably one of the so-called desert castles, of which very little remains today.
Climate.
As rainfall is only 80 mm annually, an extensive water storage and irrigation works lies in the ruins.

Lamborghini Militaria

The Lamborghini Militaria (Lamborghini LM series; the "Rambo Lambo"s) were a series of off-road utility trucks produced by automotive manufacturer Lamborghini. It was started as an attempt at the military light utility truck market (the "jeep" market segment). The vehicles in the series are greatly reminiscent of the FMC XR311, and is in turn reminiscent of the Humvee (U.S. Army HMMWV). The series expanded into the luxury sport utility market, and its primary production run was the "Lamborghini LM002", which sold over 300 units. It is considered the pioneer of the luxury sport utility market, all other comparable vehicles being utility rather than luxury. This chassis family existed from 1977 through 1993.
Successors.
Several successors to the Lamborghini Militaria were mooted.
In 1997, MegaTech, then owners of Lamborghini, initiated a project to create a new vehicle in the luxury SUV segment as successor to the LM002, codenamed "LM003" (though this model number was already previously used), it would be called the "Borneo" or "Galileo"; and be similar to a Range Rover; as an Indonesian joint venture with Timor. The vehicle was designed by Nori Harada's team at SZ Design (formerly Zagato), which also built a mockup.
In 2006, Lamborghini again tried to resurrect its SUV segment, with the Lamborghini Lagartijo (LM005). This would use the powerplant from the Lamborghini Murcielago in a chassis similar to the LM002.
In 2010, Lamborghini, then owned by the Volkswagen Group, started the LM00X project that would become the Urus, with an Audi Q5 platform and Audi S7 V8 Turbo. In 2012, they unveiled a concept car, the "Urus"; which was similar to a Porsche Cayenne and Bentley Bentayga. The Urus concept vehicle would evolve into the 2019 production SUV Lamborghini Urus.

William Ruck-Keene

William George Elmhirst Ruck-Keene MVO (30 January 1867 – 30 January 1935) was an 
Admiral of the Royal Navy.
From 1896 to 1916 he commanded naval vessels, mostly armoured cruisers, with a break of three years spent training cadets at the Royal Naval College, Osborne. His final command, from 1916 to 1919, was as Captain of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. In 1918 Ruck-Keene was promoted to Rear-Admiral, and he retired in 1920. He was promoted twice more whilst on the Retired List and became a full Admiral in 1927.
Career.
Born at Henley on Thames, Ruck-Keene was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Ruck-Keene, a descendant of Edmund Keene (1714–1781), Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and Bishop of Ely. His great-grandfather, the barrister Benjamin Keene (1753–1837), married Mary Ruck in 1780, and about 1837 his grandfather, the Rev. Charles Edmund Keene, changed the family name to Ruck-Keene by royal licence. His father was the eldest of six brothers.
The young Ruck-Keene was educated at Stubbington House School, known at the time as "the cradle of the Navy", from where he entered the Royal Navy as a Midshipman. On 1 July 1890 he was posted to the Royal Yacht "Victoria and Albert" and in August was promoted to Lieutenant. On 8 July 1896 he was appointed Flag Lieutenant to Vice-Admiral Edward Seymour for Annual Manœuvres and in August 1896 was given his first command, HMS "Opossum", a newly launched "Sunfish"-class destroyer. He was promoted to Commander on 6 November 1901 and was given a series of short-lasting commands of destroyers. On 12 March 1903 he was posted to take command of the elderly ironclad battleship HMS "Superb", and on the same day was also appointed as Executive Officer at the nascent Royal Naval College, Osborne, which opened in the late summer.
Ruck-Keene's command of "Superb" ended on 1 August 1903, leaving him free to take up his duties at the new officer cadet training college when it opened at the beginning of September. He was promoted to Captain on 30 June 1906 and in January 1907 took command of HMS "Bacchante", an armoured cruiser, and was also made Flag Captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Barry of the 6th Cruiser Squadron, remaining as Flag Captain to Admiral Sir Henry Jackson when he took over the squadron from Barry in 1908. On 4 May 1909 he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, an honour in the personal gift of the king, Edward VII, and remained in command of "Bacchante" until October 1910. In April 1911 he took command of the Admiralty yacht "Enchantress", then in August 1912 of HMS "Cochrane", another armoured cruiser.
The Great War broke out in August 1914. On 27 June 1915, Admiral Jellicoe, Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, shared with Sir Henry Jackson other officers' concerns that Ruck-Keene had become "lazy, lacks energy &amp; has run to seed &amp; is nervous". On 30 June 1915 Ruck-Keene's command of "Cochrane" was terminated, and it was not until 21 February 1916 that he was given a new command, HMS "Drake", an elderly armoured cruiser. Three months later, with effect from 31 May 1916, Rucke-Keene was appointed as Captain of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, where he remained until 21 January 1919, after the end of the war.
In June 1917 a meeting of the Board of Admiralty had debated whether Ruck-Keene had a future in the Royal Navy. On 1 January 1918 Ruck-Keene was promoted to Rear-Admiral, and he continued his service career until 17 February 1920, when he joined the Retired List at his own request. He was promoted to Vice-Admiral on the Retired List in October 1923 and Admiral on the Retired List in August 1927.

Person-ified

Person-ified is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in late 1996 and released on the HighNote label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on AllMusic, Stewart Mason states "Most of Houston Person's late-'90s albums are interchangeable collections of standards recorded with a small combo (the rhythm section led by either a piano or an organ, depending on Person's whim) and featuring Person's sterling tenor saxophone solos on top of a conservative backing. 1997's "Person-ified" is one of the string, but it's more interesting than some due to a slightly more adventurous taste in song selection. The track listing still leans heavily toward standards, but this time, Person has reached a bit deeper than usual into the great songbooks, coming up with somewhat less-obvious choices ... His backing combo is fairly anonymous, but never simply dull, and even at that, it means that Person's remarkable, underrated tenor playing is always front and center. Not bad at all"

Waterloo (blog post)

"Waterloo" is a post conservative American commentator David Frum made to his blog, FrumForum, on March 21, 2010. Earlier in the day the United States House of Representatives had passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), clearing the way for President Barack Obama to sign the sweeping health care reform into law. Frum took his title from an earlier prediction by South Carolina Senator James DeMint that the ACA would be a "Waterloo" for Obama and his presidency if Republicans could prevent its passage, much as they had done with Bill Clinton's similar efforts, which purportedly led to Republicans taking majorities in both houses of Congress in 1994.
Frum called the bill's passage a Waterloo for Republicans, none of whom had voted for the bill or contributed to its passage in any way. But while their anger over that, he conceded, might indeed rally their base to retake Congress once again in that fall's elections, he counseled, the circumstances of the defeat did not augur well for the party's long-term prospects. Despite the ACA's deep unpopularity among Republicans, Frum warned that they would never be able to repeal it since its reforms were more popular with Americans than most Republicans acknowledged. He was specifically critical of talk radio hosts and Fox News for inflaming Republican opposition to the point that party leaders who otherwise wanted to do so were averse to cooperating with Obama and congressional Democrats who had sought the bill, since it was in those outlets' interest for government to remain dysfunctional no matter which party was in charge.
The post became the most-read in FrumForum's history, drawing over a million views and crashing the site's servers. Many of the conservative outlets that had urged non-cooperation with Democrats on the ACA, such as "The Wall Street Journal"s editorial page, were in turn critical of Frum. Within a week, he was asked to leave his fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an influential conservative think tank, over the post. While some of his critics noted that he had barely been present there for the previous three years, Frum maintains his dismissal was in response to the anger he had aroused among conservatives. Some other critics called Frum's complaints about extremist rhetoric and efforts to enforce ideological orthodoxy among conservatives hypocritical in light of his own writings earlier in the decade, particularly a 2003 "National Review" cover story that attacked paleoconservatives, including many by name, as "unpatriotic" for, among other things, their refusal to support the Iraq War.
After winning control of the House that fall, and the Senate in 2014, Republicans passed bills repealing the ACA, which eventually became popularly known as Obamacare, many times, none of which ever had the votes to overcome a veto. In 2017, after the election of Republican Donald Trump, the House passed the American Health Care Act, a bill intended to "repeal and replace" Obamacare, but the Senate never considered it. Almost seven years after his original post, Frum wrote that even though it was "my suicide note in the organized conservative world" he stood firm in his prediction, and urged Republicans to take a more cooperative role in health care reform.
Background.
Historical politics of the American healthcare reform debate.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, progressives and later activists from the liberal and leftist side of the political spectrum had sought the establishment of universal health care through a mandatory government-run health insurance system or other programs. While these initiatives had often failed because most Americans who did have such insurance were accustomed to receiving it through their employers, the idea gained more traction with the public during the Great Depression, leading President Franklin D. Roosevelt to propose such a program as part of the New Deal. However, opposition from the American Medical Association (AMA) led to health-related provisions being removed from the Social Security Act prior to its 1935 passage.
Harry Truman, Roosevelt's successor, included plans for universal health coverage in his 1949 Fair Deal program, which again failed in the face of AMA opposition. Shortly afterwards the Internal Revenue Service ruled that employer contributions to health-insurance plans for their employees was a tax-deductible business expense, making those plans the primary means of health care coverage for most American workers in the private sector. Reformers' attention thus turned to groups less likely to have access to that coverage, such as the poor and the elderly; Medicaid and Medicare, created in 1965 as part of the Great Society initiatives of another Democratic president, Lyndon Johnson, met the respective needs of those parts of the population.
Opponents of national health insurance, and later Medicaid and Medicare, had attacked those proposals as "socialized medicine" and, after the onset of the Cold War, begun linking them to communism, arguing that even with limited programs there was not only a slippery slope from the government paying doctors to telling them how to do so, those programs themselves were the leading edge of a greater encroachment on "all" political freedoms. In the 1960s, those opponents began to include not just physicians but members of a nascent conservative movement, who believed that government had become too large and intrusive, not just in health care but in all aspects of life.
In 1961 Ronald Reagan, who was elected governor of California five years later, released a recording of a speech he gave against further government involvement in health care, in which he warned that Medicare would be followed by "other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day ... we will awake to find that we have socialism." In 1964, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who had won his party's nomination with strong support from the conservatives, suggested that once Medicare was in place there would be programs for other benefits. "Having given our pensioners their medical care in kind," he asked, "why not food baskets, why not public housing accommodations, why not vacation resorts, why not a ration of cigarettes for those who smoke and beer for those who drink?"
Bills to introduce universal coverage continued to be introduced in Congress, primarily by Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, but failed. Republican presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald Ford were opposed to all but the most modest expansions of existing programs, and Kennedy and his allies could not reach agreement with their successor, Democrat Jimmy Carter, later in the decade, on a plan even though he supported the idea in principle. Reagan defeated Carter in 1980; while he was not opposed in principle to universal coverage, he believed it should not be provided by national insurance, and Congress did not seriously consider any proposals for it under either his administration or that of his successor George H.W Bush.
In 1992 another Democrat, Bill Clinton, was elected President. He had made securing universal coverage a campaign promise, and shortly after taking office began having his staff put together a bill to that effect. Opposition to the bill arose again from the industry and conservatives. Their arguments now included not just the cost of the program and the tax increases that might be necessary to fund it, or its impracticability, but a generally libertarian principle that the state should not be involved in providing citizens health care at all. Leonard Peikoff, heir to the estate of influential novelist Ayn Rand, who had promoted a philosophy of maximum individualism through her work, reiterated her argument in a speech to opponents that those unable to afford their own healthcare costs could and should rely on charity or the free market rather than make any claim on the labor of health care professionals through the government.
There were nevertheless some Republicans in Congress who believed the problems with health care were real and that the country would benefit from addressing them. But conservative strategist Bill Kristol counseled Republicans to oppose the Clinton plan without reservation rather than work with the administration, primarily for long-term political reasons. If the plan passed, he warned, "[i]t will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle-class interests," he warned. "And it will at the same time strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government." The bill ultimately died without even a committee vote, and Republican opposition to it was cited as a key reason the party retook control of the House in 1994 for the first time in 40 years, as well as the Senate, having made those elections a "referendum on big government".
Opposition to big government and increased entitlement spending on health care did not prevent Republicans from adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare under the administration of George W. Bush in 2003. But when Democrat Barack Obama succeeded Bush in 2008, on a campaign promise of universal health care, Republicans once again united in opposition when Democrats, who had retaken the majority of both houses in 2006, began working on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Arthur C. Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a leading conservative think tank, cast the effort to block the ACA as .
Obama reached out to moderate Republicans for support, but none of them would reciprocate, fearful of possible primary challenges from the Tea Party, as the populist movement that arose in backlash to Obama's election and in particular the health care reform effort became known. Republicans believed that if they could prevent the passage of the ACA, they could damage the Obama presidency sufficiently enough to not only recapture Congress as they had done during Clinton's first term, but set the stage for a Republican victory in the 2012 election. In July 2009, a few months into the debate on the bill, South Carolina Republican Senator James DeMint said that it would be the new president's "Waterloo" if he failed to deliver and disappointed his base. The party leadership in Congress thus decided to oppose the ACA outright and not offer any amendments or work with the Democratic majority in any way, although some members were willing to do so.
David Frum.
After getting degrees from Yale and Harvard Law School, the Canadian-born Frum became part of the conservative movement in the mid-1980s, serving as editor of "The Wall Street Journal"s right-leaning editorial pages and later writing a column for "Forbes". He aligned himself with the neoconservative faction of the movement, supporting an activist American foreign policy that confronted certain repressive foreign regimes. Frum was not afraid to criticize other factions, as he did in his 1994 memoir "Dead Right", where he suggested that the movement should pay less heed to social conservatives and strict supply-side economics advocates.
Frum was particularly repulsed by paleoconservatism, in which he saw strong antisemitic elements, defeatism, and a willingness to abandon core tenets of conservatism such as governmental restraint in favor of nationalistic or racialistic agendas. In a 1991 article in "The American Spectator", he attacked Patrick Buchanan, a former Reagan speechwriter who would later challenge incumbent president George H.W. Bush for the Republican nomination, along these lines. After a stint as a speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration, he wrote another, broader critique of paleoconservatives in "National Review", excoriating them for their eagerness to blame American Mideast policy for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and opposition to the Iraq War, as well as the faults he had previously identified.
In 2003, Frum accepted a fellowship at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a leading conservative think tank, and continued to write for "National Review" and other conservative publications. Four years later, after some disagreements with "NR"s other writers over the direction conservatism was taking, he began planning to leave to start a new website to reassert moderate Republicanism, which he hoped could be appealing to younger readers who were "often repelled by today's mainstream conservatism". In 2009 he launched it, first as New Majority, but within a year changed it to FrumForum to avoid confusion with other similarly named organizations.
During 2009, as the House debated the Affordable Care Act, Frum dissented from the blanket opposition of his conservative colleagues in and out of power. He argued that the bill, which included some ideas originally advanced by conservatives as alternatives to the 1993 Clinton plan and then used by Republican Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for his state's universal coverage plan, offered some hope for conservatives who wanted to control the large increases in spending and taxation that might otherwise result from a plan fashioned purely by liberal Democrats. He also reminded Republicans that Democrats remembered 1993 as well as they did, and had the votes to pass a bill this time and, indeed, would. These efforts, Frum later recalled, increasingly alienated many of his longtime friends in the conservative movement.
Post.
On March 21, 2010, the House passed the ACA as amended by the Senate. No Republican in either the House or the Senate had voted for it. The House vote was tantamount to passage, after more than a year of debate and deliberation; Obama would sign it into law two days later.
That evening, Frum posted "Waterloo" to FrumForum. Nine years later he recalled writing the whole post in a half hour, in anger, as a cathartic response to accusations that he had sold out conservative principles He agreed with the general consensus among conservatives that it was their "most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s." However, while he agreed that it was possible that Republicans could retake their congressional majorities in that year's elections as a result, he was not entirely certain. The economy was slowly improving from the Great Recession that had begun two years earlier, and the benefits of the ACA would be reaching swing voters.
But more problematically, Frum warned, "[t]his healthcare bill is forever." And the fault for that, he continued, was largely conservatives' and Republicans' for refusing to compromise or negotiate. The notion that defeating the ACA would not only restore Republican control of Congress but consign Obama to a single term, he said, overlooked that Obama had been elected with 53% of the vote to Clinton's 42%, and that Democrats remembered the electoral consequences of the 1993 plan's failure. "[Again], we went for all the marbles, [but this time] ended with none."
Given the ACA's debt to ideas that had originated with conservatives, Frum wrote, Republicans could have certainly worked with Democrats to craft the ACA in some directions more amenable to conservatives, particularly given Obama's hope for a plan with bipartisan support. But they had missed their opportunity. The tax increases and Medicaid expansions Republicans had most strongly opposed were now law.
And even as Republicans promised that they would repeal the bill, Frum warned them they would never be able to due to the ACA's many popular features. "We followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement, and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat." Those voices were the conservative talk radio hosts and Fox News panelists who had gotten their listeners and viewers to so fervently oppose the ACA that Republicans in Congress who had wanted to work with Democrats and possibly prevent those provisions from becoming law, had, instead, been too afraid of their supporters' anger to even attempt to do so. "How do you negotiate with somebody ... whom your voters have been persuaded to believe wants to murder their grandmother?" he asked, referring to the supposed "death panels" opponents alleged the bill would provide for, that would decide who could get lifesaving care.
"The real leaders are on TV and radio" Frum charged. He noted how popular conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh had said he wanted Obama to fail, which he allowed was honest enough on Limbaugh's part, but accused Limbaugh of wanting the same fate for Republicans, since if they succeeded in governing effectively, the radio host's audience would be happier, and not need to listen to Limbaugh and those like him. The "conservative entertainment industry", had won as the party they professed to support had lost. "For them, it's mission accomplished. For the cause they purport to represent, it's Waterloo all right: ours", Frum concluded.
Reaction.
Traffic to FrumForum had previously peaked at around 25,000 unique visitors per day. "Waterloo" drew a million, eventually crashing the servers and making it impossible to view. However, writers at the editorial pages of Frum's former employer, "The Wall Street Journal", were able to read it and post within a few hours an editorial accusing him of "peddling bad revisionist history that would have been even worse politics". On the other side, the White House Press Secretary's office tweeted the next morning a link to the post calling it a "very interesting analysis and VERY MUCH worth a read".
Dismissal from AEI.
On the next morning, Frum got a call from AEI president Brooks. Frum was told that his fellowship, which paid him $100,000 a year with little responsibility on his part, was being terminated. He was offered the opportunity to stay on as an unpaid fellow, but declined. On the Wednesday following "Waterloo", Frum posted to his blog his letter accepting that his position at AEI had been terminated, implying that the decision had followed his discussion with Brooks.
Frum did not blame Brooks himself for his dismissal, rather pressure from AEI's donors. "I think Arthur took no pleasure in this", he told "Politico". "I think he would have avoided it if he possibly could, but he couldn't." He reiterated one of the themes of "Waterloo", that the conservative movement's intelligentsia were in thrall to the passions of its base. "[T]he elite isn't leading anymore. It's trapped."
Bruce Bartlett, a George H.W. Bush administration official who had similarly lost a position at another conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA), in 2005 after publishing a book critical of some Bush Administration policies, including the expansion of Medicare to prescription drug coverage, supported Frum's contention that pressure had been brought on AEI to conform to an ideological line. He told readers of his blog that Frum had, a few months prior, asked him if he had noticed any AEI scholars making "any" public comments about the ACA. When he said he had not, Frum speculated that they had been told to remain silent since "they agreed with too much of what Obama was trying to do." Bartlett later clarified that while AEI's blog "had" published comments on the ACA, none of them were written by anyone at the institute who was known to specialize in health care. In their conversation, Frum had merely noted this, suggested that AEI was "punching below its weight" on the issue, and merely speculated that donor pressure might be leading its experts to remain silent in the debate.
Some other conservatives differed with Frum's assessment of the reasons for his departure. They pointed out that even by Frum's own account, he had rarely even come into his office at AEI in three years, letting mail and packages pile up outside its door. Charles Murray, another AEI fellow, wrote on "National Review"s group blog, The Corner, at what he believed to be the cost of his friendship with Frum, that Frum's account of the events that led to his departure was "beyond self-serving. It is a calumny against an organization that has treated him not just fairly but generously."
Murray called Frum's suggestion that donor pressure influenced AEI's employment decisions "fantasy". Frum had been "invisible" at the think tank for the previous three years, making only three posts to the group blog during that time and not participating in any other activities to further AEI's mission of spreading conservative thought. "Being a scholar at a think tank (or any institution) is not just a matter of acknowledging your affiliation in your books and op-eds." He speculated that Frum's departure had more to do with his increasingly tenuous association with AEI than anything Frum had posted on his own blog.
On the liberal website "Salon", Gabriel Winant found Frum's story found it unlikely that AEI's donor base was composed of the "small-town, middle-class Republicans" such as those whose representatives in Congress had been most vehemently opposed to the ACA. However, he split the difference. Brooks' offer to Frum to continue at the think tank without pay did support Frum's contention that donors had expressed frustration with having to continue funding his increasing divergence from the conservative movement's steadfast opposition to the administration's healthcare reform efforts.
Other commentators from outside mainstream conservatism, and on the left, were not entirely sympathetic to Frum. "The American Conservative", an organ associated with the paleoconservatives whom Frum had denounced in "National Review" five years earlier, noted the irony of "[Frum] himself, now being purged", as did liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias. Winant too recalled that "Frum and his allies weren't just trying to drum some unsavory types out of the movement. They were also working at making it impossible for a Republican to oppose the party line on the crucial issue of the day."
In "The Nation", Eric Alterman made no mention of Frum's 2003 piece. But he noted that Frum "ma[de] ... an extremely inconvenient martyr for liberals" due to his past enthusiastic support and justification for the Iraq War. However, Alterman agreed that his ostracism had come for "stating the obvious: that perhaps GOP leaders had screwed up their healthcare fight because they were listening to the wrong people."
Tunku Varadarajan.
In a lengthy response to "Waterloo" in his blog on "The Daily Beast", Tunku Varadarajan, another former "Wall Street Journal" editorial page editor, sounded many of the same themes as Frum's other conservative critics. "I especially don't want lectures about excessive rhetoric from the man who wrote """ he wrote, also citing Frum's 2003 attack on paleoconservatives as the sort of rhetoric he was now critical of. "Passionate 'extremism' is part of any political debate, and the more of it the better." He derided Frum as a "polite-company conservative" who attacked his ideological compatriots to curry favor with Washington liberals; in that context he called Frum's post "paradigmatic".
Varadarajan also disputed many of Frum's assertions that Republicans had mishandled the ACA to their long-term political detriment. He agreed that the bill would probably never be repealed, but countered that the unyielding Republican opposition was vital to maintaining the party's core principles of minimal governmental involvement in the economy and low taxation, especially after the passage of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Not only would that principled opposition yield future electoral success, Varadarajan noted, it had affected the course of the ACA's passage when Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won the Massachusetts special election to replace Ted Kennedy after his death, costing Senate Democrats the 60th seat they needed for cloture votes to prevent filibusters and forcing an expedited vote to pass a version of the bill that some of the party's liberals were not completely satisfied with.
Responses from Frum and wife.
Frum responded to Varadarajan two days later on FrumForum, mostly taking issue with the "polite company conservative" characterization of him. He suggested Varadarajan's impression of the Washington insider culture Varadarajan accused Frum of seeking to ingratiate himself with was at odds with reality. That milieu "ceased to exist a generation ago, if it ever existed at all." The idea that a conservative would inherently prefer the company of liberals betrayed an inferiority complex, Frum said.
Varadarajan knew the truth about Washington, Frum wrote, and did not have to appeal to an outsider's imagination "from some Allen Drury novel". From their common experience of the "Journal"s editorial page, Frum continued, Varadarajan should also have been well aware of which direction the stronger economic and social pressures on aspiring conservative intellectuals came from. He asked Varadarajan if, during his time there, he had been more afraid of:
Frum's wife, Danielle Crittenden, defended her husband in a post to FrumForum. Without going into specifics or naming anyone, she decried the "dishonest slurs on his character and integrity by people who know him, and in some cases have known him for many years—truly ugly suggestions that David is motivated by cynicism or sycophancy, or both." Sounding the same theme as her husband's original post, she admonished conservatives for becoming what they had once deplored: "The thuggish demagoguery of the Limbaughs and Becks is a trait we once derided in the old socialist Left. Well boys, take a look in the mirror. It is us now."
A day after Murray's suggestion that Frum had been fired by AEI for his increasing absence there, Frum posted a response to that as well, calling Murray's post "especially unpleasant". In Frum's account of his meeting with Brooks, the timing of which did not seem to him to be coincidental, the AEI president had denied to him that his vocal dissent from the hardline conservative opposition to the ACA had any relation to his action and felt bad about having to make the decision. But, Frum also said, Brooks told him "donors were becoming much more specific about where they wanted their money to go."
"Was I terminated for under-productivity?" Frum asked. "If you'll believe that, you'll believe anything." He told readers he had, during his time at AEI, written three books, over a thousand newspaper and magazine articles as well as delivering many lectures and writing profusely online. He had also written speeches for politicians, and worked on a presidential campaign, without pay. Frum had also taking a leading role in opposing Harriet Miers' nomination to the Supreme Court. "Does AEI seriously suggest that it fired the man who led the battle that made possible Samuel Alito's confirmation to the Supreme Court because I didn't pick up my snail mail often enough?"
Frum's response to Murray's suggestion that he had been uninvolved in the behind-the-scenes work of AEI offered further proof that politics had been behind his dismissal. At the 2009 AEI World Forum conference, which he had attended, Lynne Cheney took him to task for his increasing criticisms of Limbaugh. He had not been invited to the 2010 event despite, he claimed, getting several distinguished international guests to attend.
Lastly, Frum argued, Murray was being personally hypocritical in some of his statements. He noted that Murray likewise admitted to not being present much at AEI either, due to the long commute from his Burkittsville, Maryland, home. "If that's a firing offense, I'll see him at the soup kitchen." In a later update Frum also called out Murray for taking him to task for his minimal posting to the AEI blog on "National Review"'s group blog.
Since 2010.
Seven years later, Frum described "Waterloo" as "my suicide note in the organized conservative world." He has, however, said both at the time and two years later that he still considers himself a conservative. While he has not written for, or appeared on, any conservative media outlet since then, he has continued to write political commentary, merging FrumForm into "The Daily Beast" in 2012, and as a regular contributor to "The Atlantic" since 2014. He has on several occasions revisited "Waterloo".
After 2010 election.
Later in 2010, after Republicans retook control of the House. Many celebrated; some sent Frum emails taunting him with the apparent repudiation of his prediction that March. At CNN, Frum shared his response "Enjoy the moment, fellas. You are only at the beginning of the pain of discovering how right I was."
Frum argued that Republicans, tacitly acknowledging that they would never be able to repeal the ACA, now colloquially known as Obamacare, would instead resort to "a series of stunts", such as repeal votes, refusals to fund the gradual implementation of the law, votes to repeal curbs on future growth of Medicare that they would sell as "cuts" to the program, and hearings publicizing problems with the law's implementation with those adversely affected appearing as witnesses. Focusing on those problems, however, would allow the Democrats and the administration to point out that Republicans could have perhaps averted them by participating in the process, Frum wrote.
"[A]t the end of two years, the law will still be there, more or less intact," Frum predicted. Republican leaders in the Senate understood this, he noted, and were banking their hopes on retaking control of that house as well as the White House in 2012. But Frum doubted they could win enough Senate seats for a repeal vote to overcome a filibuster, and accused Republicans, as he had several months earlier, of caring more about the issue's efficacy in winning votes than actually changing the law.
"As is, we're getting a bad trade: Republicans may gain political benefit, but Democrats get the policy," Frum concluded. "That was my warning in March 2010. This election does not discredit that warning. It confirms the warning."
Before 2012 presidential election.
In late 2011, as the first primaries for the next year's presidential election were approaching, Frum revisited "Waterloo" in a long essay in "New York" elaborating on his criticisms of the direction the Republican Party had taken. He reiterated his arguments in the original post, telling readers that although the "cadre of sinister billionaires" they might imagine controlling the party did, to some extent, actually exist, they were merely financing the party's move in the direction Fox, talk radio and other conservative media had long been pushing it in. "In funding the tea-party movement, they are actually acting against their own longer-term interests, for it is the richest who have the most interest in political stability".
Frum doubted that the Supreme Court would rule against Obamacare in a case then pending, as conservatives at the time had been hoping. "Such a decision would be the most dramatic assertion of judicial power since the thirties, and for that reason alone seems improbable" (Ultimately the Court upheld the program). And without that, any expectation that a Republican House, Senate and president could repeal Obamacare was a "mirage".
After recounting his—and Bartlett's—expulsion from their respective institutions for their ideological apostasy, saying they were not the only ones to whom this had happened, he updated the reader on what had happened since then. While the loss of his AEI position did not affect him too much economically since he had other sources of income, he could not speak for others. "The message sent to [them] ... was clear: We don't pay you to think, we pay you to repeat." Even before "Waterloo", he recalled, his vocal criticism of Limbaugh had effectively blacklisted him from Fox, and his volunteer speechwriting for one of that year's Republican presidential candidates had been kept a closely guarded secret within the campaign.
The following June, after telling "The Nation" that he planned to vote for Mitt Romney in the election, Frum again defended "Waterloo". In a decade, he said, "when every conservative in Washington says the things I said, they will still blame me for saying them. And furthermore, they will always begin saying them with the phrase, 'Look, I have no regard for David Frum. I'm no David Frum.'"
After 2016 presidential election.
In 2014, Republicans recaptured the Senate; two years later, Donald Trump won was elected President on the Republican line. For the first time since the ACA had passed, Republicans had the political power to repeal it, legislation Trump had promised to sign while campaigning. But, in March 2017, two months after Trump took office and seven years after "Waterloo", House Republicans' effort to "repeal and replace" Obamacare, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA) appeared to have foundered due to a lack of consensus among Republicans as to what form a replacement should take. A month earlier, "The Washington Monthly" had recalled "Waterloo" and said that Frum was "[t]he one conservative who saw this coming."
Writing in "The Atlantic" that week, Frum recalled how many times since 2010, as Republicans won more and more elections, he had been asked if he was still sure Obamacare would never be repealed. The failure of the AHCA, he said, vindicated him as many Americans had benefited from Obamacare and Republicans had not offered them any alternatives.
More than that, Frum argued, enough of the American public had come to accept the core principles of Obamacare since its enactment as to put Republicans in the minority of American public opinion on the issue. He again called on Republicans to take a more proactive role in shaping the future of American healthcare. Frum did not go so far as to say healthcare was a right, but called the United States' failure to ensure its citizens adequate coverage "a severe, unjustifiable, and unnecessary human wrong."
Making universal coverage a reality, Frum wrote, would accomplish many things conservatives would be proud of—increasing entrepreneurship as people would be more likely to leave their jobs and start business without the fear of losing their health insurance, improving the life expectancies of the white working-class voters who increasingly made up the Republican base, and reducing employment discrimination against workers more likely to incur higher healthcare costs, such as women and the elderly. Most importantly, Frum concluded, Americans would be less alienated as their country would finally have "joined the rest of the civilized world" in recognizing the importance of providing healthcare to all its citizens.

Lovecraft Country (TV series)

Lovecraft Country is an American horror drama television series developed by Misha Green based on and serving as a continuation of the 2016 novel of the same name by Matt Ruff. Starring Jurnee Smollett and Jonathan Majors, it premiered on August 16, 2020, on HBO. The series is produced by Monkeypaw Productions, Bad Robot Productions, and Warner Bros. Television Studios. While a second season, "Lovecraft Country: Supremacy", was in development, HBO announced in July 2021 that the series had been canceled. The series is about a young Black man who travels across the segregated 1950s United States in search of his missing father, learning of dark secrets plaguing a town on which famous horror writer H. P. Lovecraft supposedly based the location of many of his fictional tales.
Premise.
"Lovecraft Country" follows "Atticus Freeman as he joins up with his friend Letitia and his Uncle George to embark on a road trip across 1950s Jim Crow America in search of his missing father. This begins a struggle to survive and overcome both the racist terrors of white America and the terrifying monsters that could be ripped from a Lovecraft paperback".
The episodes "I Am." and "Jig-a-Bobo" establish that the "Lovecraft Country" novel exists in the continuity of the series as a novel written by George Freeman II fictionalizing the events of the series, which is retrieved from the future by his father Atticus Freeman in an attempt to change the story's narrative conclusion.
Production.
Development.
On May 16, 2017, it was announced that HBO had given a series order to "Lovecraft Country". Executive producers include Misha Green, Jordan Peele, J. J. Abrams, and Ben Stephenson. Additionally, Green serves as the series' showrunner and wrote the pilot episode. Production companies involved in the series include Monkeypaw Productions, Bad Robot Productions, and Warner Bros. Television. It was reported that Peele originally brought the project to Bad Robot Productions and enlisted Green to develop the show.
On March 5, 2018, it was announced that Yann Demange would direct and executive produce the pilot episode. While a second season had yet to be officially greenlit for production, by February 2021, HBO's president of programming Casey Bloys announced that Misha Green had begun writing and was in early planning stages. On July 2, 2021, HBO announced that the series would not be returning for a second season.
Casting.
On April 26, 2018, it was announced that Jurnee Smollett had been cast as the series' female lead. On May 2, 2018, it was reported that Jonathan Majors had joined the main cast as the series' male lead. A day later, it was reported that Wunmi Mosaku had also been cast as a series regular. On June 19, 2018, it was announced that Aunjanue Ellis and Elizabeth Debicki had been cast as series regulars and that Courtney B. Vance had joined the series in a recurring capacity.

Filming.
Principal photography for the series began on July 16, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. Filming also reportedly took place at the Chicago Cinespace Film Studios in Elburn, Illinois and White Pines State Park in Mount Morris, Illinois, at Blackhall Studios in Atlanta, Georgia and Macon, Georgia.
Music.
Laura Karpman composed the music for the show. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Karpman and her composing team had to score the show individually from their residences in eastern Europe, with Karpman adding some music tracks of her playing piano, keyboards, and other instruments. Karpman reflected on how difficult it was composing the show with the pandemic's restrictions, due to not being able to have immediate interaction with the musicians. She felt satisfied with the finished result.
Release.
"Lovecraft Country" premiered on August 16, 2020, on HBO, and consists of ten episodes.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Lovecraft Country" has received positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 88% based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 8.08/10. The site's critics consensus reads: "Anchored by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Jonathan Majors' heroic performances, Misha Green's "Lovecraft Country" is a thrilling take on Lovecraftian lore that proves the Elder Gods aren't the only thing that goes bump in the cosmos." On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Writing for "The A.V. Club", Shannon Miller lauded the show's ability to balance Lovecraft's more problematic political views with "an appreciation for [his] unparalleled vision". Brian Tallerico of "RogerEbert.com" pointed to the show's use of genre storytelling "to peel back layers of American history to reveal the systemic problems underneath it", while also describing it as "marvelously entertaining". Hugo Rifkind of "The Times" described the show as "brutal and righteously furious". The "Chicago Tribune"s Michael Phillips, in reference to earlier, less successful attempts at adaptation of Lovecraft's works, said the show "succeeds where others have not" and commended the show on its themes, despite calling the five episodes available for early review "uneven". "The New York Times"s Mike Hale credited Green's "impressively seamless job... in wielding the cultural metaphors" as part of the show's strength. In a review for "The Dispatch", Alec Dent praised the show's success at "examin[ing] racism in America's past through an unexpected genre", calling it a good reminder that "oftentimes true evil takes a normal guise". In a more critical review, Daniel D'Addario of "Variety" wrote that "the violence of Lovecraftian horror is so extreme [...] that even the most evil impulses of humanity seem an inadequate counterweight".
In an analysis of the first season, Maya Phillips of "The New York Times" criticized it for "exploiting [the past] for the purposes of its convoluted fiction", despite a promising premise. She accused the show's creators of using historical events purely "to get points for relevance", notable examples of this being the funeral of Emmett Till and the Tulsa race massacre, both of which are featured in the show.

2018 Missouri State Auditor election

On November 6, 2018, a general election in the U.S. state of Missouri was held for the post of State Auditor of Missouri. The election for Missouri State Auditor coincided with the U.S. federal midterm elections that were held throughout all 50 states, as well with other state legislative and local races in Missouri. Missouri's Class 1 United States Senate seat was also up for election on November 6, 2018.
The primary elections for this race were held on August 7, 2018. The Democrats nominated incumbent Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway, while the Republicans nominated attorney Saundra McDowell.
Galloway won election to a full term. Prior to this, Galloway had been appointed to the post by former Governor Jay Nixon in 2015, following the death of Tom Schweich.
Following the Republican victories in the elections on November 8, 2016 for Governor of Missouri, U.S. Senate, Lieutenant Governor, Missouri State Treasurer, Attorney General, and Secretary of State, Galloway and U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill became the only two remaining Democratic statewide officeholders in Missouri. McCaskill's failed re-election campaign in 2018 made Galloway the state's only Democratic statewide officeholder and only female statewide elected official. Her victory also marks the only Democratic win in a statewide election in Missouri since 2012.

2016–17 Mestis season

The 2016–17 Mestis season was the 17th season of Mestis, the second highest level of ice hockey in Finland after Liiga. Previous seasons champion Jukurit got a place in the Liiga. IPK got promoted from Suomi-sarja at the end of last season. Espoo United got a place in Mestis after Espoo Blues suffered bankruptcy and the league was exceptionally played with 13 teams.
At the end of the season SaPKo won both the regular season and the playoffs. Hokki and IPK retained their place in Mestis, while JYP-Akatemia was relegated. Hokki faced bankruptcy during the off-season and thus Imatran Ketterä were awarded a place in Mestis for the next season.
Regular season.
Top eight advance to the Mestis playoffs while the bottom two face the top two teams from Suomi-sarja for a relegation playoff. Since the highest series of Finnish hockey is a closed series no team will be promoted to Liiga.&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Rules for classification: 1) Points; 2) Goal difference; 3) Goals scored; 4) Head-to-head points; 5) Penalty minutes.
Playoffs.
Playoffs are being played in three stages. Each stage is a best-of-7 series. The teams are reseeded after the quarterfinals, so that the best team by regular season performance to make the semifinals faces the worst team in the semifinals.
Relegation qualification.
Bottom three teams of Mestis face the top two teams of Suomi-Sarja in a relegation qualification, where two top teams will get a place in Mestis for the next season. Each team will play against each other twice.

<doc id="56763448" url="?curid=56763448" title="Criminal procedure in California">
Criminal procedure in California

As one of the fifty states of the United States, California follows common law criminal procedure. The principal source of law for California criminal procedure is the California Penal Code, Part 2, "Of Criminal Procedure." 
With a population of about 40 million people, in California every year there are approximately:
There are currently 130,000 people in state prisons and 70,000 people in county jails. Of these, there are 746 people who have been sentenced to death.
Arrest.
The first step in criminal procedure is for the defendant to be arrested by the police. In California, the police may arrest a person:
If the police are claiming that they have an arrest warrant, the defendant can demand to be shown it. If the police do not have the warrant with them at the time, they can still make the arrest, but they must show the warrant to the defendant "as soon as practicable."
Citation instead of Arrest.
Alternatively, instead of arrest the police may choose to issue a citation (i.e. "notice to appear in court") if the police believe the risk of the defendant not showing up to court for arraignment (see next section below) is low. The effect is the same as arrest, but the defendant does not have to be handcuffed and taken to jail and instead remains free as long as they go to their arraignment. If the defendant fails to appear in court for their scheduled arraignment, the judge will most likely issue an arrest warrant and the police will then go into the community, find the defendant, and take them into custody.
Search.
After being arrested, the defendant may be searched by the police. If the police would like to search a person or their property before making an arrest, they must have probable cause to do so or a signed search warrant from a judge. A search warrant is different from an arrest warrant.
Interrogation.
If the police want to interrogate the defendant, they must first read the Miranda warning to the defendant, advising them of their rights. The defendant does not have to answer any questions of the police.
Pre-Trial Custody.
Upon arrest, the police will take the defendant to the local (city or county) pre-trial jail. This differs from state prison. Prison is for defendants that have been convicted of a crime after a trial and are now serving their sentence. After taking the defendant to jail, the police may decide to release the defendant with a notice-to-appear in court for their arraignment. The police cannot release the defendant on bail before the arraignment because the judge is required to set the bail amount.
Arraignment.
After arresting the defendant, the police are required by law to bring the defendant to court within 48 hours (excluding court holidays) for the arraignment hearing. The arraignment is a very short court hearing. At the arraignment, the judge will:
Preliminary examination.
If the defendant was charged with a felony, they have a right to a preliminary examination. If the defendant was charged only with a misdemeanor, they have no right to a preliminary examination but may make a motion (i.e. a request) for one. At the preliminary examination, the defendant and the criminal defense attorney can challenge the legality of the arrest. For example, they can claim the police did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant. If successful, the defendant is set free.
Pre-trial.
Setting the Date for Trial.
Defendants in California have the following statutory Speedy Trial rights.
These rights exists for several reasons. Most importantly, they exist to ensure defendants do not stay in jail for months and years waiting for a trial.
Defendants are frequently asked if they would like to waive their speedy trial rights. To waive a right means to give it up. One reason why the defendant may want to waive their speedy trial rights is so that they can have time perform their own investigation by an independent third-party which may produce different results from the investigation done by the police. The results of the third-party investigation can then be presented at trial to the jury.
Discovery.
Discovery is the process of exchanging documents between the District Attorney and the Defense Attorney that may contain evidence. In California, the District Attorney is required to turn over everything they plan to present at trial at least 30 days ahead of time, as well as any evidence that might help the Defendant show that they are innocent (see Brady disclosure). The Defense Attorney is not required to give incriminating evidence to the District Attorney, but must also turn over whatever they plan to present at trial at least 30 days ahead of time.
New Public Defender.
If the Defendant is having a problem with the Public Defender and would like a new one, they can tell the court they are making a "Marsden motion." The court will then have a special hearing, called a Marsden hearing, where the District Attorney is not allowed to be in the room. There, the Defendant can explain how the Public Defender is not being helpful and the judge can decide if the Defendant should be given a new attorney.
Self-Representation.
A defendant may choose to act as their own attorney by making a Faretta motion. This should be done as early as possible because making such a motion close to the trial date gives cause for the judge to deny the motion.
Trial.
Jury Selection.
Jury selection is a lengthy process in which the District Attorney and the Defense Attorney take turns asking questions to potential jurors. Both sides can disqualify jurors that they think won't help them. The process ends when both sides find 12 jurors plus one standby juror that they both accept, or both sides run out of juror challenges. Each side can disqualify 10 potential jurors each without giving a reason to the judge. After 10 challenges, they have to show good cause (i.e. give a reason) to continue disqualifying potential jurors.
Opening Statements.
Since the Defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty, the District Attorney has the burden of proving their case, so they make the first opening statement that summarizes the evidence they will present at trial. They summarize their point of view of what happened and why they believe the jury should find the defendant to be guilty of the crimes charged. The Defense Attorney can then make their opening statement, or choose to reserve their opening statement until the District Attorney rests their case.
Prosecution's Case.
The prosecution calls all the witnesses one by one. Witnesses are not allowed to sit in the courtroom, and must wait outside until they are called to testify on the stand. Each time the District Attorney calls a witness for Direct examination, the Defense Attorney is allowed to ask questions as well of the same witness as part of Cross-examination.
After the District Attorney has called all their witnesses and presented all of their evidence, the District Attorney announces they rest their case. This means they are finished explaining why they think the defendant is guilty. The prosecution must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. This means the evidence must be so convincing that there is no doubt left in the minds of the jury that the defendant is guilty and that the only way for them to doubt the evidence is to make "unreasonable" assumptions. (i.e. maybe aliens from Mars put the murder weapon in the defendant's car.) It is the highest standard of proof used in American law.
Defense's Case.
The Defense Attorney then calls all of their witnesses. The Defense Attorney can call new witnesses as well as witnesses that the District Attorney called. After the Defense Attorney asks questions to the witness as part of Direct examination, the District Attorney can also ask them questions as part of Cross-examination. The Defense Attorney's strategy will be either to undermine the District Attorney's claims (i.e. say that the DA has failed to prove their case by poking holes in their theory and undermining the credibility of the witnesses and evidence) or to present an "affirmative defense" (i.e. actively prove the Defendant is innocent by introducing their own evidence, such as a video showing the Defendant was out of town when the crime happened.) The Defense Attorney could also do both.
Defendant's Testimony.
The defendant has the absolute right to take the stand as a witness to testify (in self-defense) or not testify (avoid self-incrimination) at trial. The defendant's decision on this issue is of such importance that it cannot be overridden by a competing interest. (i.e. No matter what arguments are made by the DA or even the defense attorney, the defendant's choice to testify or not testify must be honored.)
Closing Statements.
Each side then summarizes what happened during the trial and their final thoughts as to why the jury should vote guilty or not guilty.
Jury Deliberation.
The jury is sent into a private room where they deliberate. All 12 jurors must vote guilty in order to convict the defendant.
Verdict.
After the jury reaches a verdict, they return to the courtroom and the court clerk announces the verdict.
Sentencing.
If the verdict is guilty, the judge gives the sentence for the crime. Criminal sentences can include any of the following, depending on the particular crime:
Probation.
After deciding on a sentence, the court may also put the defendant on probation, especially if it is the defendant's first criminal conviction, the crime itself was not very serious, and the defendant's behavior indicates they have learned from the experience. When granted probation, the imposition of the sentence on the defendant is suspended and the defendant does not have to pay the fine or become imprisoned as long as they comply with the terms of their probation as set by the judge. Probation terms may include obligations to perform community service. If the terms of the probation are violated, the court can then impose the original sentence.
Appeal.
In California, criminal defendants have the right to appeal both felony and misdemeanor convictions. If the defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor, they have the right to be released on bail pending the outcome of their appeal.
Misdemeanor appeals are heard by the Appellate Division of the California Superior Court.
Felony appeals are heard by the California Court of Appeal.
Appeals from judgements of death are heard by the California Supreme Court.

2017 Hwaebul Cup

The 2017 Hwaebul Cup was the fifth edition of the Hwaebul Cup (홰불, "Torch") celebrating North Korea's Youth Day. The competition was held between 27 July and 28 August 2017, with all matches played at the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in P'yŏngyang. The competition was arranged in two phases, a group stage followed by a single-elimination play-off semi-finals, and a single-game final. Sobaeksu Sports Club won the competition for the first time, as the defending champion, April 25, were not entered into the competition due to their taking part in the 2017 AFC Cup. Ryŏmyŏng finished second, whilst Hwaebul and Kigwancha placed third and fourth respectively.
Group stage.
Twelve teams took part in the group stage: Hwaebul, Jebi, Kalmaegi, Kyŏnggong'ŏp, Ryŏmyŏng, and Sŏnbong in Group A, along with Kigwancha, P'yŏngyang City, Sobaeksu and three other clubs in Group B. Ryŏmyŏng won Group A with three wins and two losses and fourteen goals scored, whilst Hwaebul finished second in the group; Sobaeksu won Group B, whilst Kigwancha finished second. Kyŏnggong'ŏp finished third in Group A.
Knock-out stage.
Semi-finals.
The top two finishers in each group advanced to the semi-finals, with the first-placed team in Group A playing the second-placed team in Group B, and vice versa. As such, Ryŏmyŏng met with Kigwancha, and Sobaeksu played Hwaebul. Both matches were played on 23 August
Final.
The final was played at Rungrado 1st of May Stadium on 28 August between Ryŏmyŏng and Sobaeksu, the winners of Group A and Group B respectively. Ryŏmyŏng started the game with a 4-4-2 formation and an attacking mindset, looking to defend by keep Sobaeksu contained in their own end. The first half ended scoreless, so both teams attempted to intensify their game in the second half. Sobaeksu, taking advantage of their physical fitness and better technical ability, created several worthwhile chances at the start of the half. However, Ryŏmyŏng seized an opportunity to counter, and No. 10 opened the scoring with a long-range shot in the 56th minute. Six minutes from full time, Sobaeksu made a break up the left wing, and No. 9 pounced on No. 8's cross into the box to equalise and send the match into extra time. In the 8th minute of extra time, Ryomyong’s No. 14 was sent off, but despite the numerical disadvantage, they continued to press their attack. However, in the 21st minute they turned the ball over on a misplayed pass, and scored the winning goal on a quick counter-attack, giving Sobaeksu the win and their first Hwaebul Cup title.

Westair Aviation

Westair Aviation Limited is a Namibian airline offering scheduled passenger services under the FlyWestair brand as well as cargo and ACMI services based at Windhoek-Eros. 
History.
In 1967, Westair Aviation began as an aircraft maintenance facility and since became a passenger and freight aviation company. The airline has become a provider of ad-hoc as well as air chartered services in Namibia, providing long-term lease and aircraft maintenance services. The airline also operates a variety of scheduled and unscheduled air cargo flights and has been offering a dedicated cargo service to DHL over the past 20 years. 
In June 2005 Stimulus Investment Limited, a local Namibian investment company acquired 29% of the total issued ordinary share of Westair Aviation, with the airline's management retaining 71% of the ordinary shares. Stimulus sold the shares back to Westair management in 2014 and is no longer a shareholder in Westair.
In November 2015, Westair Aviation acquired an Embraer ERJ-145 from LOT Polish Airlines. Named 'Tatekulu', this twinjet 50-seater was the first addition to the airlines' specialist fleet.
As of April 2018, the airline planned to expand its passenger route network to five scheduled destinations and six airports in two different countries in Southern Africa.

AnySurfer is a Belgian organisation that promotes the accessibility of websites, apps, and digital documents for disabled individuals. It is also the name of a quality label which websites can obtain if they are fully accessible. AnySurfer is a national project run by Blindenzorg Licht en Liefde, a Belgian non-profit organisation that provides aid to the blind and the visually impaired.
The checklist AnySurfer uses when allocating the AnySurfer label is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).
History.
BlindSurfer was founded in 2001 by Rudi Canters, a blind Internet pioneer. He was aided in his efforts by Blindenzorg Licht en Liefde. Thanks to financial support by Gelijke Kansen Vlaanderen, the project was consolidated in 2002. After Canters' death on 14 April 2003, the project and the renown of its label continued to grow.
On 1 July 2006, BlindSurfer changed its name to AnySurfer. This was done in order to avoid reinforcing the stereotype that web accessibility only benefits the visually impaired, rather than people with disabilities as a whole.
In December 2008, a second edition of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines was published. AnySurfer took part in translating these updated guidelines into Dutch, and adapted their own checklist to conform to WCAG 2.0.

My Romance (Houston Person album)

My Romance is an album by saxophonist Houston Person which was recorded in 1998 and released on the HighNote label.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Dave Nathan states "Person uses his knowledge and experience to revisit nine very familiar standards with his big, full-bodied, soulful tenor saxophone. ... Given the very intimate nature of the session, this recording could easily have been of a live performance from a small, smoky lounge. All that's missing are the tinkling glasses in the background and the light, knowledgeable applause of jazz fans who've dropped by to enjoy an evening of good music played by top jazz musicians. Those who prefer a harsh, more cutting element to their music may find this album somewhat too slick for their tastes. This session is a reminder of the pleasures that the intimate side of jazz offers"

<doc id="56763676" url="?curid=56763676" title="Navatu - Cakaudrove">
Navatu - Cakaudrove

Navatu is a sub district in Cakaudrove; one of 3 provinces situated in Vanua Levu, the second largest island in Fiji. The sub-district, or "tikina" as it is known in the iTaukei language, comprises nine villages mainly occupying the eastern peninsular of the Natewa Bay. While Copra has been the main source of income for villages in the Navatu tikina, kava or yaqona is also becoming a fast growing commodity for villages within the Navatu sub-district. 
History.
The name Navatu means 'The Rock' and is derived from the Navatu tribe or Yavusa navatu which resides in the Village of Drekeniwai. A tribe originally from Vitawa village in Ra, that migrated to Nakorotubu tikina, and later to Cakaudrove under the Gonesau's (A traditional chief in Nakorotubu, Ra province) orders to keep watch on the colonies of Vereta residing in the Natewa bay area.
Vitawa.
Some believed that they were part of an ancient tribe called the Daunavatu; A tribe that was tasked with catching turtle for Degei (an ancestral deity in Fijian mythology) when his plantains were ripe. They would catch a turtle with a special stone endowed with special mana (supernatural powers of sort) or sau, the Daunavatu people would present their finest or biggest catch to the Naqilaqila people (Chief priest of Degei) who would then take the turtle to degei along with the plantain. In one occasion the Daunavatu people deceived the snake god by presenting smaller turtles and keeping the bigger ones to eat. The furious degei who came to know of their transgressions sent down (from Nakauvadra) the lila balavu (believed to be wasting disease) upon the Daunavatu people. The Daunavatu people fleeing from degei's wrath, scattered all over Fiji, including Navatusila, Vatulele, Nadroga, Kadavu and NAKOROTUBU. The Daunavatu tribe is one of 3 tribes of the larger Navatu tribe, the other 2 tribes are the Naqilaqila and the Nasogoliku tribe.
Nakorotubu.
The Navatu tribe of Cakaudrove is said to have migrated from Nakorotubu, one of the places that the Daunavatu tribe fled to during the lila balavu epidemic. The Navatu tribe resided at Tanavuso point in the Nakorotubu coast near Nabukadra, Kavula, Ra. The Navatu people shared a close relationship with the Gonesau of Kavula, and the Ratu of Verata. Navatu was an ally of Verata during war and is considered as 'vanua veiwekani', with Verata this is one of the reason as to why the Navatu people of Cakaudrove considers Verata as their 'Mataqali or Mata'(a form of name calling usually done within the confederacy of Kubuna) and 'vei tabani'or 'tau'to Bau. This alliance between Navatu and Verata lead to the appointment of Malodali a chief from Navatu to patrol the Natewa Bay and protect and or govern the colonies of Verata that resides there and deliver messages amongst the Verata loyalists. This same chief Malodali, upon the instructions of Nacamavuto the Gonesau of Kavula brought Nailatikau Nabuinivuaka the son of Nadurucoko of Navakawaluwalu, Nabukadra, Ra to seek asylum with the Roko Tui Bau. Some believed that this was how the 'Kawa ni Vunivalu'(the ancestral line of Vunivalu) of Bau came to the island of Bau. Another Navatu chief by the name of Matawalu also made his way to Cakaudrove, some of his people now reside in Korolevu, Vunivatu, Vaturova etc.
Cakaudrove.
The people of Navatu under the leadership of Malodali resided first on the mainland at Waidau before moving to a small artificial islet of the shore near the present day Drekeniwai village, which they named Navatu island.
Matawalu, another Navatu chief who came later with some Makogai people first to Nasonisoni, a small island situated at Kubulau, Bua. From Kubulau he settled at Navatu island in Natewa Bay where Malodali had settled. As the island was getting smaller, Matawalu moved to the mainland and settled on Korolevu lands. This migration of Matawalu eastward accounts for the establishment of more people associated with Verata in eastern Vanua Levu. Some of his followers left Korolevu and settled in the western side of the Natewa Bay, namely, Vanuavou (Vusaratu people), Saqani (Saqani people), Natuvu, the Teiteiciva people, the vunivatu and Nautosolo people right up to Udu Point, who still trace their origins to Matawalu's migration from Viti Levu. Matawalu who had established his settlement at Korolevu became angry with the Korolevu who resented his use of their lands. Some claim that he also envied to be the leader of the Navatu people who settled at Navatu island, however, Malodali the Navatu chief refused to cede his position on the grounds that the Gonesau have tasked him in keeping watch of Verata's colony in the Natewa Bay area, a role he intend to retain. The people of Korolevu who have resented Matawalu sided with Malodali the official representative of Verata in that area. A war erupted between the two, and Korolevu and Naurabuta (village of the Weni people) was taken by the victors led by Matawalu and his rebel forces who later took Navatu island. Word of Matawalu's rebellion against the Veratan authority reached the Gonesau of Kavula, who sent an army led by Naboutuiloma Lailai. The rebel forces who have gathered at Caucunu in the vicinity of Nagigi were attacked and fled. The Sinu people who resided in Sinu and Navadra and have sided with Matawalu also fled to Kasavu and Vunilagi. This involved the Cakaudrove (tikina) and Sokula people (who aided Cakaudrove in this war) joined the war against the forces of Naboutuiloma Lailai.
Due to increasing population and the island being uncultivable the Navatu people moved further inland to their fortress Koroniyasaca. Here in their fortress the Natewa people sought refuge during war against the Ai Sokula (present day Tui Cakau). Navatu commanded a lot of influence in the eastern peninsular of Natewa Bay and therefore Cakaudrove (Ai Sokula) and the Natewans competed for their allegiance. The Navatu people were sea people, and were known to the Natewans as fishers of men, they were also believed to have build canoes and form a navy for the Natewan military. Navatu was a close ally of Natewa in times of war even though they were defeated by the overwhelming numbers of the combined Cakaudrove and Bauan forces. A notable Navatu warrior was Qarikau; Qarikau was renown for his role in sending back the Bauan forces when Cakobau came to wage war on the people of Navatu, leaving on the Cakaudrove coast. It is said the Cakobau arrived with his war canoes loaded with warriors and canon to wage war against the Navatu people. Qarikau floated out to Cakobau's canoe in the cover of night with a whales tooth and war club resting on a banana stem. Upon reaching Cakobau's canoe taking him (Cakobau) completely by surprise, he held out his war club on his right hand ready to strike Cakobau down and the whales tooth on his left hand. The Bauan warlord was given a choice by the warrior from Navatu, the club or the whales tooth, Cakobau quickly worked it out in his head that the club meant death and the whales tooth meant life. He chose the whales tooth and was allowed to leave for Bau with his war party. This sort of choice was again given to Cakobau by Vosavakadua.
This account however is contradictory, as it is nowhere mentioned in the TRY for Yavusa Navatu, the account of which was provided by Kilimo Waniu Ramulo himself, the then Tui Navatu. The TRY account states that the Navatu people presented a i "Soro" which in turn saved them from invasion.
Ratu i Navatu.
Amongst the nine villages of the Navatu tikina, the seat of the Ratu i Navatu or otherwise known as Tui Navatu in some cases reside in Drekeniwai village. The title is presently held by the Namatavu clan or mataqali Namatavu of Drekeniwai, Navatu. There are other chiefly titles in the tikina of Navatu, where almost every village has their own 'Turaga ni Yavusa'. Some notable ones that belong to the tikina of Navatu includes Turaga na Tui Navadra who resides in Viani village, Turaga na Tui Loa who resides in the village of Leia, Turaga na Tui Korolevu, from the village of Korolevu and so forth. The title of Ratu i Navatu is a testament of Navatu's links with Verata, as Veratan Chiefs were usually accredited with the title of 'Ratu' instead of 'Tui'. However, in formal occasions within the Tikina of Navatu (Cakaudrove) the 'Ratu i Navatu' or 'Turaga na Ratu' can also and sometimes referred to as 'Turaga na Tui Navatu'. The 'cavuti'for Navatu (Cakaudrove) is Naqorovarua vua na Turaga na Ratu (usually said in occasions within the Navatu yavusa) or Naqorovarua vua na Turaga Ratu, na Turaga na Tui Navatu (usually said during occasions where other yavusa's or tribes from Navatu tikina or outside Navatu Tikina are present).
However, some argue that the title of Ratu for the Tui Navatu is an invented tradition. The use of this "new" title was asserted following the rise to fame of the then popular coup leader and former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka.
Totems.
The moray eel (Dabea) is considered to be the totem fish (ika) for the Navatu people, and the Vesi tree as their totem tree or plant (kau). The people of Navatu's vu (traditional deity) is Ramasilevu an ancient being that can shape shift into a heron. In the TRY for yavusa Navatu, the totem fish is shark (qio).

Ka Ka Ka Po is a 2016 Indian Tamil-language comedy film written and directed by P. S. Vijay. The film stars Kesavan and Sakshi Agarwal in the lead roles, with Subbu Panchu in a supporting role. The film was theatrically released in India on 8 July 2016.
Production.
The film was titled "Ka Ka Ka Po", with a tagline of "Kavithavum Kannadhasanum Kadhalika Poraanga". The makers of the film were briefly engaged in a tussle over the naming rights of the film with the team of "Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum" (2016). Both films were referred to by the media as "Ka Ka Ka Po", a phrase taken from a popular dialogue from Chimbu Deven's "Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei" (2006). Though both films had different expansions of the phrase, director Vijay stated that he was apprehensive that his film might suffer due to the confusion. Both films later released without any problem.
For the film, Sakshi Agarwal underwent special training for stunt sequences, and also featured in a song, where she appeared in nine different get-ups. The song shoot for each look happened at different locations including Malaysia, Puducherry, and Hyderabad. The makers cast thirty three comedians in the film to play small roles.
The film's lead actor Keshavarajan Latchumanasami, who was debuting with the stage name of Kesavan, died in an accident in November 2015, before the release of the film.
Release.
The film opened to negative reviews from critics, with a reviewer from "The Times of India" stating "with a story which has almost no scope to keep the viewers entertained, the flimsy narration and sluggish making rubs salt into our wounds." The critic added "what is even more disappointing is the spectacle of a myriad talented comedians making ineffective appearances at regular intervals — all of them being wasted in inept roles".

History.
Pasay City South High School started as an Annex of Pasay City West High School formerly known as Pasay City High School located in FB Harrison, Pasay in 1967 with only two sections in the first year.
In 1968, five pre-fabricated Marcos type buildings were constructed between Andrews Avenue and Manlunas St. The PAF provided the buildings while the Pasay Government provided the salaries of teachers.
In 1969, PCSHS became independent from her mother school. Mrs. Roque was the first Principal of the school. During the incumbency, two fabricated school building was added, the Vocational and the Annex buildings. The school population increased every year. The number of classrooms became inadequate when the building fronting Manlunas St. was burned on February 26, 1978 due to faulty electrical wirings. It was replaced to Bagong Lipunan Building constructed by DPWH in 1978. As years passed by, more buildings were constructed with more convenient facilities.
Due to the transformation of Villamor Air Base into a prime residential and commercial enclave, the school was affected by the development of Newport City. BCDA in partnership with MegaWorld Corporation replicated the structure of the school to its present location at Picio Garden, Villamor Air Base, Pasay.
PCSHS has achieved its goals of academic excellence through its dynamic and supportive administrators, teachers and parents.

Kelly, in the "Dictionary of American Biography" (1928) as "an eccentric, irresponsible character whose native ability was wasted in a desultory, rambling life, and in neglect of those codes which society has erected as safeguards to the perpetuity of the race. A writer of books on sex subjects, and a pamphleteer ... [he] was held to more esteem by the laity than by the profession".

Sparrow (Ashley Monroe album)

Sparrow is the fourth studio album by American country music artist Ashley Monroe, released on April 20, 2018, through Warner Bros. Nashville. The album is produced by Dave Cobb and recorded in the iconic RCA Studio A.
Background.
In an interview with "Rolling Stone", Monroe said "I knew I wanted to work with Dave; all of his records are consistently awesome and classic, timeless, old and new all in one". Monroe also teamed with notable writer-artists Brendan Benson and Waylon Payne, including on the seductive "Wild Love", and with longtime friends Angaleena Presley and Anderson East, recording the album while pregnant with son Dalton, who was born in August 2017. In a press release to CMT she stated "To me, this record is about acknowledging past hurt, forgiveness and freedom to move forward. The most terrible things that happen to you are the most beautiful songs. That's what I respect most about music."
Sonically, Monroe lists country pop-oriented material by Glen Campbell, Shelby Lynne, Waylon Jennings and Elvis Presley as influences, particularly for their use of strings. She also mentioned listening to albums by Elton John and Rick Hall during recording.
Critical reception.
"Sparrow" received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 86, based on 8 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it "sharply constructed as an album, setting a mood with its first song and then finding variations on this lush, enveloping sound." Thierry Côté from "Exclaim!" concluded his review saying "she has crafted a captivating Southern Gothic country-soul masterpiece, one that can stand proudly next to the timeless works that inspired it. There may not be a better record to come out of Nashville in 2018."
Commercial performance.
The album debuted at No. 21 on "Billboard"s Top Country Albums, selling 4,900 copies in the first week. It has sold 8,000 copies in the United States as of June 2018.

Baker House (Alcester, South Dakota)

The Baker House, located at 48113 SD Highway 48 near Alcester, South Dakota, was built in 1914. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is located on the South Dakota side of the Big Sioux River.
It was designed by Sioux City architect G.W. Burkhead, who also designed the NRHP-listed Mount Sinai Temple (Sioux City, Iowa).
The house is described as "a large two-and-one-half story "Neoclassical Eclectic"style country house. Classically symmetrical in design, the building features a projecting temple-like portico or porch. It has a red tiled roof, a cut stone foundation, and concrete walls marked in a wave design meant to resemble stucco from a distance. Neoclassical elements include the pediment extending over the front (south) porch, which is supported by four doric columns with square shafts, capitals, and bases. A palladian window occupies the tympanum of the pedements, which also feature horizontal and vertical strap work. Modillions and dentils run beneath the cornice and around the pediments."
It is significant as one of few vestiges of English settlers who emigrated to the Le Mars, Iowa area in the 1880s; "its English country style is found nowhere else in South Dakota. Because of its uniqueness of architectural style, it is a outstanding reminder of the English settlers, and for this reason it deserves nomination to the National Register."

End of Life Choice Act 2019

The End of Life Choice Act 2019 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand that seeks to give people with a terminal illness the option of receiving assisted dying. The Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health confirmed that, "The Bill uses “assisted dying” to refer to both euthanasia and assisted suicide. Euthanasia refers to a patient being administered a lethal drug by a medical practitioner. Assisted suicide refers to a patient receiving lethal drugs at their request, which they take by themselves." 
ACT New Zealand MP David Seymour entered it into the member's bill ballot on 14 October 2015. The bill passed its first reading on 13 December 2017, with 76 votes in favour, 44 opposed; its second reading on 26 June 2019, with 70 votes in favour, 50 opposed; and its third reading on 13 November 2019, with 69 votes in favour, 51 opposed. 
A binding referendum was held in conjunction with the 17 October 2020 general election on whether the Act should come into force, with a majority of voters voting in favour of the Act. The result of the referendum means that the Act will come into force on 7 November 2021, 12 months after the official result was declared.
Contents of the bill.
Eligibility for assisted dying.
Anyone may request assisted dying, but a person may receive it only if an attending medical practitioner and an independent medical practitioner confirmed that the person meets all of the following eligibility criteria:
Process of assisted dying.
A person who wishes to have an assisted death must inform an attending medical practitioner. The medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form after talking to the patient about the prognosis of their illness; the irreversible nature of assisted dying and its impacts; and alternative options for end-of-life care. The doctor needs to encourage the person to discuss their wish with others, but the doctor also needs to tell the person that they don't have to discuss it with anyone.
The attending medical practitioner needs to "do their best to ensure that the person expresses their wish free from pressure from any other person". The doctor must do this by talking with other health practitioners who are in regular contact with the person and with family members approved by the person. If this doctor (or a nurse practitioner) suspects that a person "is not expressing their wish free from pressure from any other person", the process must be stopped. 
The person must confirm their request by signing and dating a prescribed form in the presence of this practitioner. The second part of the form may be signed by someone else if the person cannot write for any reason. 
Once the form has been completed the attending medical practitioner, and following that an independent medical practitioner, must confirm whether the person meets the eligibility criteria. If one or both medical practitioners are unsure about the person's mental competency, a psychiatrist must confirm whether the person is competent. specialist appointed by the SCENZ Group (Support and Consultation for End of Life in New Zealand Group). If eligible, the person can choose the date and method of administration of the lethal dose of medication. Once the medication has been administered the attending medical practitioner must complete a prescribed form notifying the registrar at the Ministry of Health that an assisted death has occurred. The registrar must then forward the form to a review committee.
Legislative history.
Justice Select Committee.
Written submissions to the Justice Select Committee on the End of Life Choice Bill were received until midnight on 6 March 2018. The committee reported on the Bill on 9 April 2019.
Second Reading.
12 MPs changed positions between the first and second readings. From Labour, Allan, Russell, Rurawhe, Whaitiri and Wood changed from voting for to voting against, while Williams voted for having previously opposed the bill. From National, Guy, Hipango, Tolley and Walker changed from for to against, while Collins and Yule decided to reverse their opposition. Five National MPs had entered Parliament since the first reading but had no net effect on the result- Willis (for) replaced Joyce (against) which was cancelled out by Bidois (against) replacing Coleman (for).
Committee of the Whole House.
The Committee of the Whole House started on 31 July 2019. An amendment by David Seymour that limited eligibility to only those with a terminal illness was agreed to. Other amendments put forward by opponents of the bill were rejected.
The End of Life Choice Bill was debated again on 21 August 2019. Parliament voted to accept Seymour's second round of amendments by a vote of 69 to 51. Key amendments include prohibiting a health practitioner from initiating any discussion about assisted dying, giving employment protections for any doctor, nurse, or psychiatrist who objects to taking part in the process on any ground, and a provision for doctors and nurses to stop the process if they suspect any pressure is being applied on the person seeking assisted dying. The amendments by MPs opposed to the bill including National MPs Maggie Barry, Paulo Garcia, Simeon Brown, and Chris Penk were defeated during the debate. Penk's proposal to have tighter provisions against coercion including getting a "sign-off" from a specialist panel was defeated by 71 to 49 votes. MPs also voted 70 to 50 in favour of the End of Life Choice Bill being given a third and final reading later.
Proposed referendum.
On 23 October 2019, the New Zealand Parliament voted by a margin of 63 to 57 to amend the End of Life Choice Bill to include a binding referendum on whether the End of Life Choice Act 2019 should come into force. New Zealand First Member of Parliament Jenny Marcroft proposed an amendment to include a referendum on the grounds that euthanasia "directly affected the fabric of society" and that "temporarily empowered politicians... alone should not decide on the bill." In response, Labour Member of Parliament Louisa Wall criticised NZ First for placing MPs who supported the bill but opposed the referendum in an "untenable position." She also accused NZ First of using the proposed referendum as a bargaining chip for securing the party's support for the third reading of the End of Life Choice Bill scheduled for November 2019.
Third Reading.
On 13 November 2019, the End of Life Choice bill passed its third reading 69 votes in favour and 51 votes opposed. The Bill is being prepared for royal assent. In return for New Zealand First's support of the bill through its third reading, the Bill will be decided by the public in a binding referendum at the 2020 New Zealand general election. The End of Life Choice Bill was also amended to only allow a person with "a terminal illness that is likely to end the person's life within six months" to request euthanasia. While Seymour disagreed with the legislation, he supported the amendment in order to maintain the support of the Green Party and several other MPs for a third reading.
2020 Euthanasia referendum.
A binding referendum on euthanasia was held alongside the 2020 New Zealand general election and the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum on 17 October 2020. Preliminary results for the two referendums were released by the Electoral Commission on 30 October. These preliminary results found 65.2% of people in support of the End of Life Choice Act with 33.8% opposed.
Following the counting of the 480,000 special votes, official results for the general election and referendums were released on 6 November. Based on the final results, 65.1% of people supported the legislation while 33.7% opposed it.

Conor Simpson

Conor Simpson (born 1994) is a competitive performer of Irish stepdance from Canberra, Australia. Having begun dancing at his mother's school at the age of nine, Simpson has been highly successful in local and international competition. He is one of the few Australians to win a title at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (the Irish Dancing World Championships), and has also performed professionally.
Personal life.
Born in Canberra in 1994 to Irish dancing teacher Monica Simpson, Simpson grew up with his father, mother and sister. He played soccer and rugby league as a child during his education at Marist College, taking up Irish dance only after being "bribed" by his mother and sister into taking classes.
He is currently studying a double degree in finance and economics at Australian National University.
Competitive career.
Simpson took classes at his mother's Simpson Academy of Irish Dance from the age of nine. He won seven age group titles at the ACT Championships, as well as winning his section at the Australian Irish Dancing Championships in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017. In 2009, he competed at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, the World Championships of An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha, for the first time, placing third in his section. He returned in 2010 and 2013, placing third and fourth respectively.
In 2013, after finishing his secondary education, Simpson spent a gap year in Belfast, Northern Ireland, training and competing with former world champion dancer Gerard Carson at the Carson-Kennedy Academy. That year, in addition to Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, he competed in a number of other major international championships, including the All Scotland Championships and All Ireland Championships.
After placing third at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne in 2014 and second at the North American National Championships the same year, Simpson returned to Carson in Ireland for six weeks at the end of 2014. After a period of intense training, Simpson won the men's 20-21 years championship at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2015 in Montreal, Canada, becoming only the sixth Australian to win an individual title at the World Championships.
Simpson returned to the Worlds in 2017 after spending time as a professional dancer, placing third in the open age men's competition. His preparation for competition, though restricted by his university studies, had expanded to four dance classes a week in addition to a strength and conditioning program, totalling some 20 hours a week.
Performance career.
In late 2015, following his competitive success, Simpson was approached by producers for the Australian tour of Irish dance show "Lord of the Dance". He successfully auditioned along with another local male dancer, and was immediately flown to Adelaide to join the tour, which left Australia for Broadway shortly afterwards.

Bigg Boss Marathi

Bigg Boss (or colloquially Bigg Boss Marathi) is the Marathi-language version of the reality television programme Bigg Boss based on Big Brother and airs on Colors Marathi. Mahesh Manjrekar as continued as a host from first season onwards.
The third season was planned to launch in May 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the makers officially announced that the launch of season 3 will be on 19 September 2021 onwards.
Overview.
Concept.
"Bigg Boss Marathi" is a reality show based on the Hindi show Bigg Boss which too was based on the original Dutch Big Brother format developed by John de Mol Jr. A number of contestants (known as "housemates") live in a purpose-built house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their fellow housemates for eviction, and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public vote. Eventually, one housemate would leave after being "evicted" from the House. In the final week, there will be five housemates. remaining, and the public will vote for who they wanted to win. Unlike other versions of Big Brother, the Marathi version uses celebrities as housemates, not members of the general public.
The house.
The house is well-furnished and decorated. It has a range of modern amenities, but just two bedrooms, living area, kitchen, store room, smoking room, and four toilet bath rooms. There is a garden, pool, activity area and gym in the House. There is also a Confession Room, where the housemates may be called in by Bigg Boss for any kind of conversation, and for the nomination process. The House has no TV connection, no telephones, and no Internet connection. The set has been built on the place of Big Boss Hindi version. There are 100 cctv cameras which keep eye on contestants.
Rules.
They are not supposed to tamper with any of the electronic equipment or any other thing in the House. They cannot leave the House premises at any time except when permitted to. They cannot discuss the nomination process with anyone. They cannot sleep in the day time. Also, they need to wear mic all the time and speak in only Marathi language. Sometimes, the housemates may be nominated for other reasons, such as nomination by a person who has achieved special privileges (via tasks or other things), for breaking rules or something else. If something is very serious, a contestant may be evicted directly. All the rules have never been told to the audience, the most prominent ones are clearly seen. The inmates are not permitted to talk in any other language than Marathi language.
Nomination.
Nomination is a mandatory activity, usually taking place on first day of the week in which all housemates need to take part unless directed by Bigg Boss. Each housemate nominates two other housemates for eviction. Housemates getting maximum nomination votes will be nominated for eviction from the house in that week and undergoes public vote (through Voot) for retention. On the weekend episode, usually one contestant with lowest public votes will be evicted from the house. A housemate may also be directly nominated for eviction by that week's captain of the house or for other reasons by the Bigg Boss. Housemates who are awarded 'immunity' can not be nominated by other contestants. Immunity is automatically given to the week's captain and can be earned by contestants through winning specific tasks or achieving secret tasks given by Bigg Boss. Sometimes, the captain can make a contestant immune from nomination upon Bigg Boss' direction. The housemates are not allowed to discuss about the nominations or the nomination process with each other.
Captaincy.
The captaincy concept was introduced in the second season. A captain is selected for every week by the Bigg Boss through specific tasks or elected by the housemates. A captain will have additional privileges in the form of immunity from nomination for that particular week, exemption from participating in the task activities and a separate bedroom with facilities more than that of other contestants. The captain will be exempted from nomination procedure for his/her captaincy week and will have power to either nominate a housemate directly or make a housemate immune from nomination or rescue a nominated housemate, depending on Bigg Boss' decisions. Captain's main duty is to supervise the weekly task and make sure the conditions and stipulations are met and task is performed well to procure the 'luxury budget' for the next week. Captains should also keep an eye on house rules and may punish a housemate for violating the rules.
Broadcast.
"Bigg Boss Marathi" is aired on Colors Marathi. Everyday's episodes contain the main happenings of the previous day. Every weekend episode mainly focuses on an interview of the evicted contestant by the host.
Eviction.
Contestants are nominated every week by their housemates. Viewers cast their vote in favour of the contestants they would like to save from eviction. The contestant with the fewest votes is evicted from the house.

Pier Paolo Calzolari

Pier Paolo Calzolari is an Italian artist (born in Bologna in 1943) who was originally associated with Arte Povera.
He currently lives in Lisbon (Portugal).
1960s and 1970s.
After spending most of his childhood in Venice, Italy where the cultural Byzantine heritage and the singular light of the city over the water profoundly influenced his work. He moved in 1965 to Bologna at Studio Bentivoglio where he set up his studio. His first seminal pieces grew from his stay at the Palazzo where a lot of artists are hosted and showed (screenings with films by Ari Marcopoulos, Jonas Mekas, Andy Warhol...) Between 66 and 67 he works on his first performance piece entitled "Il filtro e benvenuto all’angelo".
Between 1968-69, at the age 25, Pier Paolo, worked in Urbino as an assistant at the Academy of Fine Arts where he became a teacher later in 2002-2003. In 1969, Pier Paolo also participated in the historical show "Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form" (also included were Carl Andre, Joseph Beuys, and Eva Hesse among others) curated by Harald Szeemann at the Kunsthalle Bern that marked the beginning of an international career. Among many others exhibitions, he was part of the Documenta 5 in 1972.
1980s and 1990s.
In the late 1980s, Calzolari retreated to Fossombrone, a small town in the Marche region of central Italy, where he has largely kept out of the public eye and worked in his studio. During the 1980s and 1990s, Calzolari participated in exhibitions at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (1994), MoMA PS1 in New York, and The Royal Academy of Arts.
Present.
Today, Pier Paolo Calzolari is represented by Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York and Kamel Mennour, Paris.
His latest retrospective, titled Painting as a Butterfly, was at Museo d'Arte Contemporanea Donnaregina in Naples from June 8 - September 30, 2019.

Joseph McCabe (hunter)

Joseph McCabe (1816 Cape Town – 28 February 1865 Molepolole, Botswana was a South African hunter, trader, explorer and botanical collector. He was the son of an Irish surgeon serving in the British army.
At first he worked as a clerk in Uitenhage and in 1835 took part in the Sixth Frontier War. He followed the Great Trek to escape British autocracy in the Cape Colony and acquired a farm some distance north of present Potchefstroom, leaving from there on hunting expeditions, and on occasion returning to Grahamstown. In 1846 he was charged by the Transvaal authorities with supplying arms to local Bantu tribes, but the case was dismissed for want of evidence. 
Letsholathebe, of the Batawana tribe, purchased Ngamiland's first horse from McCabe in 1852.

Attack on Odzanu Junction Farm

The Attack on Odzanu Junction Farm happened on 21 August 1977, when cadres from the ZANLA attacked the Odzanu Junction farm, which is seventeen miles north of Unitali on the Mozambique border. The farm was owned by white Rhodesian farmer Marty Marius Sleigh. 
The Raid.
The cadres attacked the houses on the farm which housed the farm's labour force, composed of black Rhodesians. The cadres rounded up the workers and their families before they opened fire indiscriminately on the men, women and children. Twelve men and women and two children were killed and twelve wounded. Two of the wounded died later in hospital. The sound of gunfire woke up Mr Sleigh and his sixteen‐year‐old son, Cornel Sleigh, when they left their house they saw that the cadres had set fire to their farm's workers compound after they had shot the workers and their families. Mr Sleigh and Cornel Sleigh opened fire on the terrorists, with guns that they kept in their house for protection, and the terrorists fled into the bush, firing a few shots as they went.

SAM-VI is a member of the riboswitch family. It is predominantly found in "Bifidobacterium" and exhibits some similarities to the SAM-III (Smk box) riboswitch class, but lacks most of the highly-conserved nucleotides of SAM-III class. SAM-VI aptamers bind the cofactor S-adenosylmethinine SAM (a key metabolite in sulphur metabolism) and discriminate strongly against S-adenosylhomocysteine SAH. The class was discovered by further analysis of Bifido-"meK" motif RNAs.

Conrad Knowles

Conrad Theodore Knowles (1810 – 19 May 1844), born in England, was an Australian actor and theatre manager. With no formal training, he became a versatile and accomplished actor, and his roles included several Shakespearian parts; he was the first actor in the country to play Hamlet and King Lear.
Early years in Australia.
Knowles was born in England in 1810. His father John Knowles, a Wesleyan minister, "was induced to let his son indulge his natural disposition for travel and adventure"; Knowles was an early emigrant to the Swan River Colony (later Perth). The colony experienced difficulties and in April 1830 he arrived in Hobart Town, where he was a tutor of drawing and languages.
He later moved to Sydney, where distant relatives lived. The Theatre Royal opened in 1832 and, although he had no theatrical experience, he became an actor at the theatre. He was unwilling to lose the friendship of his Wesleyan relatives, and at first appeared as Mr Cooper, but eventually he left the Methodist church. From the second season he used his own name; he was acting manager, and played melodramatic, tragic and comic roles. He played major Shakespearian roles; he was Australia's first Hamlet and King Lear.
He was a favourite with Sydney audiences. Although he was criticized for not closely studying his parts, it was acknowledged that he played many roles and had managerial duties. He had a relationship with Harriet Jones, an actress who had appeared in Sydney since 1826; from 1839 she was usually known as Mrs Knowles.
In May 1837 he sailed for England to join his brother's legal firm; he returned, for his health, in October 1838. Having seen William Macready and other notable actors in London, his subsequent acting was more refined.
Rival theatres in Sydney.
In 1838 the Royal Victoria Theatre opened in Sydney, and Knowles performed there, in 1840 becoming stage manager. He wrote a play, "Salathiel", a dramatization of "Leila; or, The Siege of Granada" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and it was produced in 1842, being performed twice.
In 1842 the Olympic Theatre, an elaborate tent created by Luigi Dalle Case for his circus performances, opened in Hunter Street. Knowles and Harriet moved there, and Knowles soon became manager After a few months they returned to the Victoria Theatre, where there was a new leading player with a professional background, F. Nesbitt McCrone. In May 1843 he moved to the Royal City Theatre, a small theatre in Market Street opened by Joseph Simmons, an actor-manager; however it closed after a few weeks.
Final year.
Later that year Knowles, in Melbourne, opened a temporary 500-seat theatre, The Pavilion, in Bourke Street. On 4 September he produced "Othello", the first Shakespeare play performed in the colony.
Knowles died on 19 May 1844, after a short illness. An obituary commented that since he began his acting career, "he has laboured... to advance the interests of the profession, of which he was so distinguished an ornament, with credit to himself and gratification to the play-going public, who have now to regret the loss of a sterling actor, and an accomplished but unfortunate gentleman."

Hungarian Pictures

Hungarian Pictures, sometimes also referred to as Hungarian Sketches, Sz. 97, BB 103 () is a suite for orchestra by Hungarian composer Béla Bartók finished in 1931. The suite consists of orchestrations of earlier short pieces for piano composed between 1908 and 1911.
Composition.
The original piano pieces were created during Bartók's journey around Romania and Hungary, when he started collecting and arranging folk music that further transformed his somewhat Lisztian early style into the style he came to develop. Therefore, many of the compositions from this period were either based on folk music or created from scratch with a reasonable resemblance to folk music. However, neither money nor widespread fame would be plentiful in his lifetime, as he had to struggle with a moderate opposition in his country to his modern style and some of his major works, such as The Miraculous Mandarin, being banned for years.
From the 30s onwards, Bartók started arranging some of his piano music for orchestral concert performance with the expressed intent of making money out of it. This was the case of his Transylvanian Dances, arranged from his Sonatina, and this set, which takes five pieces from works created two decades earlier. The set was completed in August 1931 in Mondsee. Pieces 1, 2, 3 and 5 were premiered in Budapest by the Budapest Concert Orchestra under Massimo Freccia on January 24, 1932. The first complete performance of the whole suite took place two years later, in November 26, 1934, with Heinrich Laber conducting the Philharmonic Society Orchestra. It was eventually published by Editio Musica Budapest in 1983 and arranged for wind quintet by Christopher Sears in 1985.
Structure.
The suite consists of five movements and has a duration of 12 minutes. The movement list is as follows:
Even though all of the pieces sound like original folk melodies, only the last one in the set uses genuine folk material. The suite follows a common practice by Bartók: using a slow central movement surrounded with two scherzos. The score calls for a large symphonic Orchestra: two flutes and piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets and bass clarinet, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones and tuba, timpani, xylophone, triangle, side drum, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, harp, and a string section.

Samuel J. Tomlinson House

The Samuel J. Tomlinson House is a single family home located at 841 Calhoun Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
In 1869, this property was purchased by S. J. Tomlinson, who was at the time the city clerk and the editor of the local paper, the Lapeer Clarion. Tomlinson likely constructed this house in the early 1870s. In 1880, Tomlinson moved from here to the Peter Van Dyke House. The Tomlinson House went through multiple owners until 1888, when it was transferred to C.W. Laing, who purchased it for his aging parents, David Nicholson Laing and Anne Ward Laing. Laing was an architect from Chicago, and likely added the porte cochere and made other interior modifications to the house. C.W. Laing's sister married a Vosburgh, and the structure remained in the hands of their family until 1966.
Description.
The Tomlinson House is a two-story, L-shaped Italianate wood-framed house clad in clapboard on a stone foundation. It is similar in size and massing as the nearby John and Rosetta Lee House. The front facade has a first floor bay window and paired and rounded-arch windows on the second floor, along with paired brackets along the roofline. A front porch is supported by chamfered wooden posts with arches.

Frostpunk

Frostpunk is a city-building survival videogame developed and published by 11 bit studios. Players take on the role of a leader in an alternate-history late 19th century, in which they must build and maintain a city during a worldwide volcanic winter, managing resources, making choices on how to survive, and exploring the area outside their city for survivors, resources, or other useful items. The game features several scenarios to undertake, each with their own stories and different challenges.
The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows in April 2018, but was later made available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2019, and macOS in February 2021. The game received generally positive reviews upon release and sold over 3 million copies within three years of its release. 11 Bit studios has partnered with NetEase Games to bring the Frostpunk Mobile version in 2021.
A sequel, "Frostpunk 2", was announced on August 12, 2021.
Gameplay.
The player, known simply as "the Captain", starts out with a small group of survivors that consists of workers, engineers, and children, and several small caches of supplies with which to build a city. From there players harvest coal, wood, steel and food in order to keep their society warm and healthy in the midst of constantly fluctuating temperatures. Weather conditions and political turmoil can cause citizens to not want to work as hard. In most scenarios save for "On the Edge" the entire city is centered around the generator, a coal-reliant steam engine that produces heat in a circular radius, which can be extended and intensified throughout the game, requiring greater coal input. The game emphasizes the need to prioritize buildings depending on the heat they require; houses and medical facilities will require close placement to the reactor, lest the player face outbreaks of frostbite and illness. While houses can be insulated better throughout the game, medical facilities will need to be kept above -20°C, or face being inoperable. Workplaces will also need to be insulated, which can be achieved through gathering posts or steam turbines, or completely circumvented with the introduction of machine labor, or "Automatons".
The player has the option to use laws to regulate the productivity of their society at the cost of possibly raising discontent, e.g. allowing child labour or forcing temporary 24-hour shifts, but also laws to develop better healthcare like prosthetics or extra rations to the sick. In most scenarios, the player also has the option to increase the citizens' support either by "Order" which includes buildings and laws to enforce security, or by "Faith", which includes buildings and laws that implement a religion. These two paths can be continued to the point of fanaticism, with the "Order" path leading to a militaristic autocracy, while the "Faith" path leads to a total theocracy. With the final law on either path, the Captain is proclaimed absolute ruler, and the hope mechanic is replaced with a constant value. In addition, a platform is constructed to execute "enemies" or "unbelievers" by scalding them to death with steam from the generator; the player may schedule an execution to lower discontent in their city. Adopting any of the last three laws of both paths will lead to the "Crossed the line" ending, should the city survive, where the game remarks how humanity crossed the line and forsook its values in the quest for survival. 11BitStudios have mentioned multiple times that the Law system was designed to force players between the choice of survival or retaining humanity, creating a moral dilemma the game is based around.
Technology is another gameplay feature, with the ever colder environment forcing the city to adapt with better insulation, stronger reactors, better industrial output and more efficient machinery. Building a workshop structure allows the player to research technology and buildings that will make the city more efficient. The city can also construct a beacon to scout the surrounding frozen wasteland for additional survivors and resources.
Plot.
The game is set in an alternate 1886 where the eruptions of Krakatoa and Mount Tambora, the dimming of the Sun, and other unknown factors caused a worldwide volcanic winter. This in turn led to widespread crop failure and the death of millions. This event roughly lines up with the historical 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, a volcanic event that led to global cooling.
In response to this, several installations called "generators" were built by the British Empire and the United States in the coal-rich North, designed to be city centers in the event that dropping temperatures force mass migration from the south. In all scenarios, the player is the leader of a city around a generator, and will have to manage resources to ensure the city's survival.
The game launched with three scenarios, each with different backgrounds and storylines. Three additional scenarios were added as DLCs, one free to all players and two as part of the Season Pass. Endless Mode was also introduced in a later patch that eschews narrative elements to focus on surviving for as long as possible while weathering intermediate storms.
In the main scenario, the player is the leader of a group of explorers who fled the cold and the hunger of London in an expedition to find supposed massive coal reserves in the North. Instead, the group gets separated from the main expeditionary party and discovers a massive heat generator in a giant sheltered crater and settles there, establishing the city of New London. The player begins to face the issue of the people's dwindling hope as they find out, through exploration, a city similar to theirs called Winterhome has been destroyed, leaving few survivors. The player has to make hard decisions in order to help the people find their purpose and stay hopeful, as well as prevent an uprising by those who wish to return to London. The player later also has to prepare enough supplies to make sure the city survives the ever decreasing temperature, starting at -20C, and slowly decreasing, with some spikes, to an average of -70C. After a certain time, and the conclusion of the Londoners Arc, refugees will arrive, warning of a "Great Storm" incoming, acting as an Endgame. The player will have to stockpile resources, collect refugees, and recall scouts and outposts before the Storm arrives. Coal mines become effectively inoperable due to the cold, the generator struggles to heat the people, frostbite becomes rampant, and hope falls as the temperature falls to -150C in the eye of the storm. Surviving the storm with at least one citizen will result in a "victory", though the consequences may vary. It is suggested that the severity of this storm, and its seemingly huge scale, means that New London is the last city on Earth.
In the second scenario, the player is the leader of a group of scholars from Oxford and Cambridge responsible for establishing a self-operational city for the purpose of preserving seeds and plants from around the world from the volcanic winter. They settle around a generator located in an ice crevasse. Unlike most other scenarios, the city's population is entirely made up of engineers, and rely primarily on automatons for resource gathering. During the gameplay, the player will be presented with the issue of the neighboring city of New Manchester struggling with resources, and will have to make a choice whether or not to help them prepare for the Great Storm.
In the third scenario, the player is set as the leader of a refugee group who have taken over a generator reserved originally for a large group of wealthy lords, led by Lord Craven, the last Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The player will also have to deal with constant waves of refugees seeking shelter in the city, including the overthrown lords. The player will have to decide to accept them or reject them while also minding the limited resources they have access to; if the lords are allowed to return to the city, the player must either find a way to integrate them or else leave them to be killed or forced out by the people of the city.
Released on September 19, 2018 as a free DLC, this scenario takes place just prior to the main scenario and centers around the city of Winterhome. Through ineffective management by a neglectful leader, resources ran dry and the city fell into anarchy and rioting. Hundreds die in the fighting, starvation, and cold. The player is tasked to rebuild what is left of the city and its residents, but after getting things under control, the player learns that the city's generator is damaged beyond repair, and has only a few days to put in practice an evacuation plan before the generator explodes.
Introduced in Frostpunk's 1.3.0 patch, Endless Mode is a highly customizable scenario where players endeavor to build a city to survive for as long as possible. Unlike all the other scenarios, there is no major story or quest objective beyond surviving each winter storm as they come and the scenario only ends when the player loses (either the generator is destroyed or all the people die). Players can choose between two primary sub-modes and one of several different maps, each with different challenges players have to take into account while planning their city. The Endurance sub-mode features fewer available resources and harsher weather while the Serenity sub-mode grants the player most of the earlier technologies and enjoys shorter blizzards. An additional Temporary Hazards setting will also randomly plague players with severe setbacks that inhibit some aspect of their city for a limited time.
Released on August 27, 2019 as a DLC included in the Season Pass, "The Rifts" add a new canyon-filled map to Endless Mode with a new building - "The Bridge" - used to cross over them.
Released on January 21, 2020 as a DLC included in the Season Pass, "The Last Autumn" is a prequel scenario set just before the onset of the global winter. The British Empire has created the Imperial Exploration Company to scout across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada for sites to construct generators; the player is the overseer of one such location, "Site 113", for the intended evacuation of Liverpool. While constructing their own generator, the player will also be called to investigate the loss of contact with Sites 107 and 120 (destroyed by shoddy workmanship and a syndicalist revolt, respectively), leaving the player's construction site as Liverpool's last hope. If the player takes too long in construction, they risk being fired by the IEC and sent home, ending the game. As the scenario progresses, the first snow begins to arrive and the sea freezes, cutting the site off from the supply ships, and the player must continue to work on the generator and wait out the freezing weather until an icebreaker can arrive to take them home to England. The scenario includes new technology trees and resources, new buildings (including a telegraph station, labour unions, and docks), new Books of Law to determine societal changes moving forward, and new threats to the settlement, including toxic gas leaks and worker strikes. The DLC also includes "The Builders", a new sub-mode for Endless Mode, which involves rebuilding a destroyed generator in winter conditions.
The final DLC content of the Season Pass, released on August 20, 2020, "On The Edge" is a sequel to the main scenario, including new challenges and game mechanics. The player is the leader of "Outpost 11", set up by a scouting party from New London near an abandoned army warehouse uncovered by the Great Storm. The outpost is forced to satisfy increasing demands for resources in exchange for food, causing the workers to revolt and declare the outpost's independence from New London; at this point, the player can give the outpost a name of their choosing. Unlike other scenarios, the outpost has no generator (forced to rely on coal-fired braziers for heat, similarly to the later stages of "The Last Autumn") and limited ways to produce resources locally, so they must depend on trade with other settlements they make contact with to make ends meet. Later in the game, the outpost is informed that New London is in a severe crisis and must choose to provide aid and save the city, or leave it to its fate and prepare for a wave of refugees. The DLC also includes the option of including outposts and trading in all sub-modes of Endless Mode, along the option of triggering random events that will hinder the city's progress.
Development.
The game was announced in August 2016. The developers were initially targeting a release in late 2017, but it was delayed until 24 April 2018. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2019. The game was developed using 11Bit Studios internal game engine named Liquid Engine.
Ports to iOS and Android are being developed by NetEase Games, with the iOS version expected by the end of 2021.
Reception.
"Frostpunk" received "generally favorable reviews", according to review aggregator Metacritic. It was nominated for "Best Strategy Game" at the Game Critics Awards, for "Best Visual Design" and "PC Game of the Year" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for "Best Strategy Game" at The Game Awards 2018. It won the award for "Strategy Title of the Year" at the Australian Game Awards 2018, and was nominated for "Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year" at the D.I.C.E. Awards, for "Game, Simulation" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, for "Music of the Year", "Best Original Soundtrack Album", and "Best Music for an Indie Game" at the 2019 G.A.N.G. Awards, and for "Narrative" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards.
As with many other titles by 11 Bit Studios, Frostpunk places more emphasis on its story than sandbox features. While the plot and soundtrack have been greatly praised, some have criticised the lack of re-playability, citing the predictability of the story upon repeat. Frostpunk does have endless game modes, where the player can build and expand their city with dynamic challenges, however many still feel there is missed opportunity in sandbox features.
It sold over 250,000 copies within three days of its release, over 1.4 million within a year and 3 million within three years.
Board game.
A "Frostpunk" board game designed by Jakub Wiśniewski and Glass Cannon Unplugged and loosely based on the video game was sold via Kickstarter in October 2020. The Kickstarter campaign achieved €2,496,308 in sales.
Sequel.
A sequel was announced on August 12, 2021. "Frostpunk 2" is set in New London 30 years after the "Great Storm" of the original game, and the consequences of the advent of petroleum industry in New London.

John P. McGoff

John P. McGoff (1925 – January 21, 1998) was an American conservative newspaper publisher. He was the founder of the Panax Corporation and Global Communications, and the owner of "over seventy newspapers across the United States." His ties to the apartheid-era South African government drew attention from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Michigan State University community, but his 1986 charges were dropped due to a five-year statute of limitation. He filed for bankruptcy upon his retirement.
Early life.
John P. McGoff was born in 1925. He spent his early years with his family, including six siblings, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father was a steel worker. During World War II, he served in the United States Army both in Italy and Africa. He graduated from Michigan State University in 1950.
Career.
McGoff began his career in media by working for MSU's radio station, WKAR-FM. He purchased his own radio station in Lansing, Michigan in 1958. He subsequently founded the Panax Corporation and Global Communications, and became the owner of "over seventy newspapers across the United States." His newspapers took a decidedly conservative stance, promoting free enterprise. McGoff attempted to purchase "The Washington Star" in 1974 but his bid failed, as did his 1977 bid for the "Oakland Tribune".
McGoff was falsely described as "a major apologist for the white supremacist government in South Africa" by the "Detroit Free Press" in 1975. He served as a founding member of the board of "The Citizen", a South African newspaper founded in 1975. In 1983, McGoff was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of purchasing "The Sacramento Union" for $6 million and acquiring a $1.3 million in the United Press International Television News via a "$11.3 million no-interest loan from South Africa." His $500,000 donation to MSU for the dedication of a theatre in honor of his wife was returned after members of the MSU community objected to his ties to the apartheid regime the following year. In November 1986, he was charged on suspicion of being an "unregistered foreign agent for South Africa since 1974." By December 1986, the charges were dropped by Federal District Judge Charles Robert Richey due to a "five-year time limit" as McGoff had cut his ties with the South African government in 1979.
McGoff "filed for personal bankruptcy" in 1995 after the buyer of one of his newspapers, "The Macomb Daily", failed to pay him and left him with a 40 million dollar debt.
Personal life, death and legacy.
McGoff married Margaret Ewert and they had five children. They resided in Williamston, Michigan and they retired in Charlevoix, Michigan. McGoff was a fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a "close friend" of President Gerald Ford.
McGoff died of cancer on January 21, 1998 in Charlevoix, at age 73. He is the namesake of the McGoff Performing Arts Center at Williamston High School.

Columbus Tuttle House

The Columbus Tuttle House is a single-family home, now converted to a medical office, located at 610 N. Main Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
Columbus Tuttle arrived in Lapeer in 1853, and soon after constructed a house at this location. He founded a planing mill in Lapeer some time before 1860. The mill originally served the local market, but as Lapeer grew and the railroads were built through, Tuttle expanded to supply a wider market. As the lumber industry dwindled in the 1880s, Tuttle retooled his mill and began to produce finished and ornamental products. In 1890, Tuttle decided to construct a new home on this lot, and hired Daniel Wadsworth to build this house. Tuttle lived here until his death, after which the house was owned by Frank R. Cutting, another local lumberman. In 1948, the house was converted to doctor's offices.
Description.
The Columbus Tuttle House is a wooden Queen Anne structure with irregular massing on a stone foundation. It has multiple gables, and an exterior ornamented with sunburst panels, decorative shingling, fanlights, and stepped windows. The front facade has a slightly projecting bay; a porch, enclosed in 1905, abuts the projecting bay. The enclosure is detailed with transoms containing small colored panes.

Oposa v. Factoran

Oposa v. Factoran (G.R. No. 101083), often alternatively titled Minors Oposa v. Factoran or Minors Oposa, is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines which recognizes the doctrine of Intergenerational Responsibility on the environment in the Philippine legal system. The case is a contributor to the development of international environmental law.
Background and history.
The Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and his predecessors have granted timber license agreements (TLA) to various corporations to cut the aggregate area of 3.89 million hectares for commercial logging purposes. 
Petitioners, through their parents, sought to make the DENR Secretary stop issuing licenses to cut timber, invoking their right to a healthy environment pursuant to Sections 15 and 16 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. The petitioners further asserted that they "represent their generation as well as generations yet unborn." They further claimed that the Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in granting TLAs to cover more areas for logging than what is available. Respondent, on the other hand, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint had no cause of action against him and that it raises a political question.
The Judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati sustained the dismissal and ruled that granting of the relief prayed for by petitioners would result in the impairment of contracts which is prohibited by the Constitution.
Decision.
Doctrine of intergenerational responsibility.
The Court did not agree with the arguments of the respondent. The complaint focuses on one fundamental legal right — the right to a balanced and healthful ecology which is incorporated in the Constitution. It carries with it the duty to refrain from impairing the environment and implies, among many other things, the judicious management and conservation of the country's forests. Section 4 of E.O. 192 expressly mandates the DENR to be the primary government agency responsible for the governing and supervising the exploration, utilization, development and conservation of the country's natural resources. Such policy is also substantially re-stated in the Administrative Code of 1987. Both E.O. 192 and Administrative Code of 1987 have set the objectives which will serve as the bases for policy formation, and have defined the powers and functions of the DENR. Thus, right of the petitioners to a balanced and healthful ecology is as clear as the DENR's duty to protect and advance the said right.
The Court found no difficulty in ruling that they can, for themselves, for others of their generation and for the succeeding generations, file a class suit. Their personality to sue in behalf of the succeeding generations can only be based on the concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned. Such a right, as hereinafter expounded, considers the "rhythm and harmony of nature."
The Court further elicited that every generation has a responsibility to the next to preserve that rhythm and harmony for the full enjoyment of a balanced and healthful ecology.
Aftermath.
After the decision, the Philippine government had inventoried the remnant old growth forests and restricted logging in those areas. The case is recognized in its contribution in the development of international environmental law.
In 2008, Antonio Oposa, a Filipino Lawyer, was awarded by the Center for International Environmental Law for his contributions to the development and implementation of international environmental law in his native country and internationally.

Fiery Jack

"Fiery Jack" is a song by the Fall released in 1980 as their fourth single.
Composition.
Singer Mark E. Smith said the song was written about "the ageism thing, where people are supposed to be screwed after they're 29", directed towards middle-aged men who are "hard livers with hard livers; faces like unmade beds", and that the song was intended to represent "the people in the pubs where I go are 48 or 50, but they've got more guts than all these other preeners. In every generation, you get this core of spirit, and they never lose it.". The track is grounded by a rockabilly-beat, described by journalist David Wilkinson as chosen due to its being a rhythm that would "likely have been to the taste of a middle-aged working class Mancunian in 1979". Simon Reynolds saw it as "a coruscating portrait of one of Manchester's finest sons, the hard-bitten product of five generations of industrial life...a forty-five-year-old pub stalwart who's spent three decades on the piss, ignoring the pain from his long-suffering kidneys", also speculating that Jack may be an amphetamine user.
Smith stated in a "Sounds" interview at the time of the single's release that Jack was "the sort of guy I can see myself as in twenty years".
Recording and release.
The single was recorded at Foel Studios in Llanfair Caereinion, Powys, Wales in October 1979, and produced with Geoff Travis and Mayo Thompson, who had accepted Smith's invitation to work on the sessions. Smith recorded the vocals for "Fiery Jack" in the studios' courtyard as he liked the echo that it created. It was released in January 1980 by Step-Forward, the band's last release on the label before moving to Rough Trade Records. As well as "Fiery Jack", the band recorded the B-side tracks "2nd Dark Age" and "Psykick Dancehall #2" (a song originally released on their "Dragnet" album), and "That Man", which wasn't included, but was later released on the "Totale's Turns" album.
The sleeve's artwork was designed by Smith's sister Suzanne, with text by Mark E. Smith which mentioned Roman Totale XVII (one of several references to this character in the band's early releases), and claiming the contents of the single were found next to Totale's remains, "the results of experiments which took place in the remote Welsh hills one autumn" and urging the reader to "never unleash it on humanity".
A live version was included on the 1980 album "Totale's Turns", and the studio version has since been included on several compilations of the band's work.
Reception.
"Fiery Jack" was chosen as 'Single of the Week' by "Sounds". According to Mick Middles the song saw the band "perfecting pomposity, the Fall jump into the rough and raw world of rockabilly with confidence in excess. 'Fiery Jack' sees the band at their painful best, a number that glides on and on and on."
The single entered the UK Independent Chart on 23 February 1980, peaking at number 4, and spent twenty weeks on the chart. "Fiery Jack" was voted by listeners to John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show at number 38 in the 1980 Festive Fifty.

Pittendreich Mill

Pittendreich Mill in Elgin, Scotland, was built around 1830 by Moray Estates with parts stemming from the early 19th century, and designed to handle meal, flour and barley.
Milling is known to have been carried out in the area as early as 1200. An earlier mill was erected between 1444-1445 by the priory of Pluscarden, leading to a dispute with James Douglas who had received Pittendreich from King James III in a feu charter of 1469. This later led to James Douglas joining an attack on Dean Alexander Dunbar in the chanonry of Elgin in which the dean was badly wounded and his thirteen-year-old daughter, killed.
Pittendreich Mill was powered by water from the Black Burn until the early 1900s when it was converted to oil. Later conversions included electricity. The mill would process meal, flour, and barley, with a kiln used to dry oats which would then be milled into oatmeal. The mill closed in the 1930s
After several years of disuse, the mill was converted into a home in 1976. The kiln now served as a chimney, with one mill-stone acting as a lounge feature and the other embedded in a grassy bank outside the property. More recently, the property was offered for sale in December 2006 and again in September 2017.

Kjøbenhavns Forstæders Sporveisselskab

Kjøbenhavns Forstæders Sporveisselskab (literally "Copenhagen Suburban Tramway Company") was an operator of three tramways in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company was founded in 1872 and merged into De kjøbenhavnske Sporveje in 1898.
History.
Kjøbenhavns Forstæders Sporveiiselskab was founded by O.V. Bruun after he had been granted a concession on the establishment and operation of a tram line between Tringlen and Gammel Kongevej on 5 August 1872. He subsequently founded the Blegdamsvej Line which opened on 12 April 1873 and was initially served by nine tram cars that operated with nine minute intervals.
The company obtained the concession on the Farimagsgade Line. It was inaugurated on 22 July 1883 and was initially served by eight one-storey tram cars that were operated with eight minute intervals.
The company's Nørregade Line, its third and last tram line, was inaugurated on 20 July 1884. It was served by five one-storey tram cars with seven minute intervals.
O.V. Bruun died on 23 July 1884 and was succeeded by E. Lautrup. He had previously served as inspector at Frederiksberg Hospital. More tram cars were added on all three lines in the 1890s.
Kjøbenhavns Forstæders Sporveisselskab merged with four other tram companies under the name A/S De kjøbenhavnske Sporveje on 1 August 1898. E. Lautrup was CEO of the new company, a position he held until his death in 1902.

Gernot M. R. Winkler

Gernot Maria Rudolph Winkler PhD (October 17, 1922 – April 30, 2016) was responsible for the Time Service Department of the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) from 1966 to 1996.
Winkler oversaw the introduction of caesium beam-based Coordinated Universal Time based on hyperfine transitions and an internationally transportable "flying clock". 
This in turn led Winkler to promote precision global positioning techniques (initially by time-reliable surface broadcasts in the LORAN and Omega radio-beacon chains, later by two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTT).
Early life.
Gernot was born in the Austrian town of Frohnleiten, which is the home of a technology institute (Technisches Büro für Luftfahrt und Maschinenbau). He was the son of Gustav and Eleanor (Née Schneider) Winkler. His interest in astronomy was inspired by German spaceflight pioneer Hermann Oberth when he was about 12. The science fiction writer Jules Verne was also a favourite. During WWII he was drafted into the Wehrmacht; he was arrested by the US Army in Italy. 
In 1947, Winkler resumed his studies at the University of Graz. In 1952 he obtained a PhD in theoretical physics and was an associate of the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory.
In 1956 he and fellow Austrian Fritz Reder arrived in the United States to work in the microwave resonance branch of the Signal Corps, joining the USNO that year.

Thermal attack

A thermal attack (aka thermal imaging attack) is an approach that exploits heat traces to uncover the entered credentials. These attacks rely on the phenomenon of heat transfer from one object to another. During authentication, heat transfers from the users' hands to the surface they are interacting with, leaving heat traces behind that can be analyzed using thermal cameras that operate in the far-infrared spectrum. These traces can be recovered and used to reconstruct the passwords. In some cases, the attack can be successful even 30 seconds after the user has authenticated.
Thermal attacks can be performed after the victim had authenticated, alleviating the need for in-situ observation attacks (e.g., shoulder surfing attacks) that can be affected by hand occlusions. While smudge attacks can reveal the order of entries of graphical passwords, such as the Android Lock Patterns, thermal attacks can reveal the order of entries even in the case of PINs or alphanumeric passwords. The reason thermal attacks leak information about the order of entry is because keys and buttons that the user touches first lose heat over time, while recently touched ones maintain the heat signature for a longer time. This results in distinguishable heat patterns that can tell the attacker which entry was entered first.
Thermal attacks were shown to be effective against plastic keypads, such as the ones used to enter credit card's PINs in supermarkets and restaurants, and on handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
In their paper published at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2017), Abdelrahman et al. showed that the attack is feasible on today's smartphones. They also proposed some ways to mitigate the attack, such as swiping randomly on the screen to distort the heat traces, or forcing maximum CPU usage for a few seconds.

Rafiqul Islam ( – 5 March 2018) was a Bangladeshi physician and medical scientist. He is known for the discovery of food saline (Orsaline) for the treatment of diarrhea.
Early life and education.
Islam was born in 1936 in the then British India's Bengal Presidency (now Bangladesh) in Chauddagram Upazila, Comilla. He passed MBBS from Dhaka Medical College and Hospital in 1965. Later, he received high education in Trinity Medicine and Hygiene in Trinity (UK).
Career.
After passing MBBS, Islam joined the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh and retired from this institution in 2000. While working in this organization, he researched various medicines. One of his most important inventions is the food saline (Orsaline). When cholera spread in the refugee camps of West Bengal in India during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, only therapeutic (intravenous) fluid was given to the vein as treatment. But due to the lack of intravenous fluid, it was possible to recover from the disease with its saline disinfected. After the independence of Bangladesh, a widespread publicity campaign was conducted on the use of saline in the treatment of diarrhea. As a result, it was also known as "Dhaka Saline". In the year 1980, the World Health Organization recognized Orsaline. Besides, Bangladeshi non-government organization BRAC played the role of spreading food saline to the remote areas of Bangladesh.

Compressed air dryer

Compressed air dryers are special types of filter systems that are specifically designed to remove the water that is inherent in compressed air. The process of compressing air raises its temperature and concentrates atmospheric contaminants, primarily water vapor. Consequently, the compressed air is generally at an elevated temperature and 100% relative humidity. As the compressed air cools, water vapor condenses into the tank(s), pipes, hoses and tools that are downstream from the compressor. Water vapor is removed from compressed air to prevent condensation from occurring and to prevent moisture from interfering in sensitive industrial processes. 
Excessive liquid and condensing water in the air stream can be extremely damaging to equipment, tools and processes that rely on compressed air. E.g. the water can cause corrosion in the tank(s) and piping, wash out lubricating oils from pneumatic tools, emulsify with the grease used in cylinders, clump blasting media and fog painted surfaces. Therefore, it is desirable to remove condensing moisture from the air stream to prevent damage to equipment, air tools and processes.
There are various types of compressed air dryers. These dryers generally fall into two different categories: primary, which includes coalescing, refrigerated, and deliquescent; and secondary, which includes desiccant, absorption, and membrane. Their performance characteristics are typically defined by flow rate in Standard Cubic Feet per Minute (SCFM) and dew point expressed as a temperature, (sometimes referred to as Pressure Dew Point.)
Applications.
Water contamination is an inherent byproduct of compressing atmospheric air. Because of this phenomenon, compressed air systems usually benefit from the addition of a compressed air dryer located on the output of the air compressor and/or at various locations throughout the distribution system. In most cases, the output of the compressor is processed through a primary dryer or system dryer. In cases where higher quality air is required the output of the primary dryer is further processed through a secondary dryer or polishing dryer.
Coalescing filters.
Coalescing filters aren’t actually filters, rather they operate more as a consolidation element. The idea behind these devices is that the compressed air is forced through gaps or porosity within an otherwise solid element. These gaps and/or porosity are microscopic and small enough that water vapor wets to the internal surfaces. The liquid water that forms during the wetting process is forced through the media and drips down into a trap. The dry air travels up to and out of the discharge port.
There are two basic types of coalescing elements. The first type utilizes a cast material that is dominated with an internal microscopic lattice. The air is forced to flow through the lattice which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces. The second type is generally referred to as a stacked plate element. In this case, fine discs are stacked with microscopic gaps between them. The air is forced to flow through the gaps which, in turn, allows the water vapor to wet to the internal surfaces.
In principle, a coalescing filter is an ideal way to separate water from the compressed air stream. Practically speaking, this is not the case. Coalescing elements are extremely sensitive to oil and particulate contamination and therefore would be better placed as a second stage dryer. However, the dew point performance of a coalescing filter places it in the primary category of compressed air dryers. In order to use coalescing filters as primary dryers, they are typically set-up in pairs. The first filter has an element with larger gaps that are designed to remove oil from the stream. The second filter uses a finer element that is intended to remove water vapor. Because of the sensitivity of the elements, coalescing filters are not particularly common. One area where these filters have found acceptance is with dental compressors. The way that dental compressors are designed and used makes a two-stage coalescing filter an almost ideal solution for water contamination in these systems.
Refrigerated dryers.
Refrigerated dryers are the most common type of compressed air dryer. They remove water from the air stream by cooling the air to approximately 3 °C (38 °F) and effectively condensing out the moisture in a controlled environment. 3 °C (38 °F) is the realistic lower limit for a refrigerated dryer because a lower temperature runs the risk of freezing the separated water. They are typically specified as primary dryers and generally produce air quality that is appropriate for approximately 95% of all compressed air applications.
Refrigerated dryers employ two heat exchangers, one for air-to-air and one for air-to-refrigeration. However, there is also a single TRISAB heat exchanger that combines both functions. The compressors used in this type of dryer are usually of the hermetic type and the most common gas used is R-134a and R-410a for smaller air dryers up to 100 cfm. Older and larger dryers still use R-22 and R-404a refrigerants. The goal of having two heat exchangers is that the cold outgoing air cools down the hot incoming air and reduces the size of compressor required. At the same time the increase in the temperature of outgoing air prevents re-condensation.
Some manufacturers produce "cycling dryers". These store a cold mass that cools the air when the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 1.5 °C - 4.5 °C (35 °F – 40 °F) range. When selected with the optional "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points. Non-cycling dryers use a hot gas by pass valve to prevent the dryer from icing up.
Some manufacturers produce "cold coalescing filters" that are positioned inside of the air dryer at the point of the lowest air temperature (the point at which maximum condensation has occurred).
Refrigerated dryers are generally manufactured in one of two different ways, Freon based units and Joule-Thomson based units.
Freon-based refrigerated compressed-air dryers.
These dryers derive their cooling from a closed cycle refrigeration system based around one of three commercial refrigerants, R-22, R-134a or R410a. The refrigeration system these dryers use is similar to home and commercial air conditioning systems. The schematic shown to the right illustrates a typical Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryer.
Freon-based refrigerated compressed air dryers generally consist of a heat exchanger that is similar to a water cooled after cooler. Instead of using water as the coolant, liquid CFC fills the shell of the heat exchanger. The liquid CFC is maintained at a pressure that allows it to boil at 3 °C (38 °F). After the CFC boils, the vapor is drawn through the suction line into a compressor, which compresses the CFC to a high pressure and high temperature. The high pressure/temperature CFC is cooled in the condenser and relaxes into its liquid state. The liquid is reintroduced into the heat exchanger via the metering device and a closed refrigeration cycle is formed. When the compressed air passes through the heat exchanger, it is cooled to the temperature of the boiling CFC. As the compressed air is cooled, it loses its ability to retain moisture and the water vapor condenses onto the inside of the exchanger tube.
Variations on this basic design include units equipped with reheating exchangers, which are intended to improve efficiency. In these cases, the cooled compressed air is reheated by the incoming air.
Refrigerated compressed air dryers typically have a Remaining Oil Content of 6 mg/m3. 
Refrigerated compressed air dryers with internal cold coalescing filters are rated to leave the remaining oil content as low as 0.008 mg/m3, which is far less than coalescing filters that are downstream of air dryers, because the cooled compressed air is reheated by the incoming air. Larger refrigerant dryers have air-to-air heat exchanger between warm incoming air and chilled outgoing air. Cooled oil and water fogs coalesce much better in a coalescing filter at the cold temperatures than one in the warmer oil and water vapors located downstream of the air dryer air-to-air heat exchanger. 
Compressed Air Coalescing Filter Performance.
Coalescing Filters collect liquids and aerosols, not vapors, see the Mechanical Coalescers section at Coalescer. In the table above, the LOCATION means where the Coalescing Filter is relative to Refrigerated Air Dryer. 1 mg/m3 is a weight of oil in a volume of air and is approximately equal to 0.83 ppm by weight. 
High temperature dryers are equipped with an additional pre-cooler that removes excess heat via a forced air system. These units are designed to allow excessively hot compressed air to be effectively dried. Compressed air temperatures in excess of 38 °C (100 °F) are very common in Southern climates, mining operations, steel mills, shipboard, etc. In areas and applications that demand operations in elevated ambient temperatures, high temperature dryers are a necessity.
Cycling dryers (also known as thermal mass dryers) utilize a thermal mass, usually a tank of water, to store the energy produced by the refrigeration system. The temperature of the water controls the refrigeration system through a thermostat. The compressed air passes through the thermal mass via a water cooled heat exchanger. The value of this type of configuration is that they normally produce more consistent cooling results.
Joule–Thompson (JT) based refrigerated compressed air dryers.
JT type dryers are units that utilize the compressed air stream as their refrigeration element. High pressure compressed air (150~175 PSI) is fed into a pressure reducing valve on top of the dryer. The output of this valve (90–120 PSI) is directed into an expansion chamber which is surrounded with porous walls. As the air expands to a lower pressure, it becomes cold (based on the Joule-Thomson Effect) and its ability to retain moisture is reduced. The moisture is released from the air in the form of fog. The fog laden air then passes through the porous walls of the chamber. The micro-droplets of water that make up the fog wet to the porous material and collect until they form droplets that can be affected by gravity. The water then drops into a trap and the dried air travels up to and out of the discharge port. The drawback of the JT Dryer is that it can only be used with two-stage compressors. This is because a two-stage compressor derives its efficiency by pumping to a high pressure (150–175 PSI.) This pressure is inappropriate for the shop floor and must be dropped to (90–120 PSI.) The JT Dryer takes advantage of this pressure drop to remove moisture from the compressed air stream through the inherent refrigeration based on the Joule-Thompson effect of the expanding air. Leveraging this pressure drop allows a JT dryer to produce the same relative dew points that Freon-based dryers produce.
Deliquescent dryers.
Deliquescent dryers typically consist of a pressure vessel filled with a hygroscopic medium that has a high affinity for water vapor. Practically speaking, these dryers are typically a large pressure vessel that is filled with salt crystals. When water vapor comes in contact with the salt, it attaches and dissolves the media, or deliquesces. As liquid water builds on the salt crystals, brine is formed, which drains down and collects in the bottom of the vessel. Periodically, the brine must be drained and similarly, the media must be refilled. Typically, deliquescent dryers will produce a dew point suppression of 10 °C to 14 °C (18 °F to 25 °F).
On the plus side, these dryers are very simple, have no moving parts and do not require electrical power. However, they do not perform well with high temperature air streams and/or in high ambient temperatures. They are disproportionately large units which are filled with a corrosive substance. Their size and corrosive nature can present problems with any system that uses them. Because of this, these dryers are typically used only in specialty applications. Common applications often involve remote, hazardous, or mobile work sites. Deliquescent dryers are used for removing water vapor from compressed air, natural gas, and waste gases such as landfill gas and digester gas.
The performance of a deliquescent dryer, as measured by outlet dew point, is highly dependent on the temperature of the air or gas being processed, with cooler temperatures resulting in better performance
Desiccant dryers.
Desiccant dryers, sometimes referred to as absorption dryers, operate by absorbing water vapor into a porous media with a high affinity for water.
These types of dryers are also referred to as absorption systems or getters. Because these dryers get and hold the water, they are minimally effective as a first stage dryer. If a desiccant is used in this role, the media quickly becomes saturated and the effectiveness of the dryer is negated. Desiccant dryers are best applied in a second stage or polishing role. They are usually used down-stream from a refrigerated dryer or some other primary dryer. When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub zero range.
Desiccant dryers are typically supplied in two patterns, “Single Canister” and “Twin Tower” units. Single canister units have the outward appearance of a filter housing. However, they are filled with a granular media that must be periodically replaced. The media can be regenerated by baking it at a high temperature in accordance with the manufacturers’ recommendations. Single canister desiccant dryers are typically installed in point-of-use applications. When applied as a second stage dryer, they can easily and reliably produce dew points in the sub-zero range.
A variation on the single canister desiccant dryer is the Toilet Paper filter. These types of filters provide the same basic function as a desiccant dryer except they use an ordinary roll of toilet paper as their absorption media. When the toilet paper becomes saturated, it is removed and replaced with a fresh roll. The popularity of these filters is primarily based around their low cost, convenience and effectiveness. Surprisingly enough, these types of filters are very effective in point-of-use roles.
Twin Tower, or regenerative desiccant dryers, have two vertical tanks filled with media. The compressed air is passed through a pressure vessel with two "towers" filled with a media such as activated alumina, silica gel, molecular sieve or other desiccant material. This desiccant material attracts the water from the compressed air via adsorption. As the water clings to the desiccant, the desiccant "bed" becomes saturated. When the media in the first tank becomes saturated, the air stream is automatically redirected through the second tank. The first tank is then heated while a portion of the dried air, referred to as the purge air, is back flowed through the tank and vented to atmosphere. This process dries, or regenerates, the media in the first tank and makes it ready for the next redirect. One of the most significant drawbacks of twin tower desiccant dryers is their use of the purge air. Typically, a twin tower desiccant dryer uses some 15 to 20% of its capacity to regenerate the opposite tank, making these dryers inefficient and costly to operate.
The task of the desiccant is to bring the pressure dew point of the compressed air to a level in which the water will no longer condense, or to remove as much water from the compressed air as possible. A standard dew point that is expected by a regenerative dryer is −40 °C (−40 °F); this means that when the air leaves the dryer there is as much water in the air as if the air had been "cooled" to −40 °C (−40 °F). Required dew point is dependent on application and −70 °C (-94 °F) is required in some applications. Many newer dryers come equipped with a dew dependent switching (DDS) which allows for the dryer to detect dew point and shorten or lengthen the drying cycle to fulfill the required dew point. Oftentimes this will save significant amounts of energy which is one of the largest factors when determining the proper compressed air system.
The regeneration of the desiccant vessel can be during three different methods:
Membrane dryer.
"Membrane dryer" refers to a dehumidification membrane that removes water vapor from compressed air. Membrane dryers operate on the principle of migration. The compressed air to be dried is passed over a membrane that has a high affinity for water vapor. The water vapor builds on the membrane and migrates through to the opposite or low pressure, side. A dry cover gas is flowed across the low pressure side and absorbs the water on the membrane. After absorbing the water, the cover gas is discharged to the atmosphere. The cover gas is generally taken from the output of the dryer. The membrane is typically a series of small tubes collected in a bundle within an outer housing.
Some dryers are non-porous, which means they only permeate water vapor. Non-porous membranes' drying power is only a function of flow rate, pressure. The sweep flow is strictly controlled by an orifice and is not a function of temperature. Porous membranes are modified nitrogen membranes and pass air as well, usually changing the composition of the compressed air by reducing the oxygen content. The only maintenance required is changing the prefilter cartridge twice a year. The performance of porous membranes are dependent on temperature as well as operating pressure and flow.
Membrane air dryers depress the incoming dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point is lower than the specified challenge air then the outlet dew point is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a -40 °C (−40 °F) dew point with a challenge of 21 °C (70 °F) dew point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 0 °C (32 °F), the outlet dew point will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet dew point will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet dew point is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet dew point than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent on the nature of the membrane and could vary among manufacturers.
Membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate. If set up and operated properly, membrane dryers can produce extremely low dew points. For this reason they are very common in laboratories, medical facilities and specialty manufacturing environments where limited amounts of high quality compressed air is required. They are usually set up as a point-of-use dryer and provide the best service when used in a second or third stage role. The delicate nature of the equipment and how it is used makes them generally unsuitable for more mainstream or industrial applications. Membrane air dryers are used in pneumatic components, spray painting, laser plenum purge, air bearings, air spindles, medical equipment, air guns and pneumatic brakes for vehicles and trains.

William H. and Sabrina Watson House

The William H. and Sabrina Watson House is a single-family home located at 507 Cedar Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
William H. Watson was a florist who sold greenhouse, bedding, and vegetable plants. He and his wife, Sabrina, constructed an earlier house on this property. They then had this house constructed, likely in 1878-79. It was one of the first Queen Anne houses constructed in Lapeer. Later occupants of the house included W.S. Abbot, a postmaster, and John B. Sutton. In 1911, Sutton sold the house to real estate agent Elmer Holman, Sr., who added substantial details to the interior. The house remained in the Holman family until 1984.
Description.
The Watson House is a two-story brick structure, with a dominant square three-story tower on the front facade. The tower is capped by a cross-gabled roof, with large and elaborate paired brackets. Wooden molding encircles the tower, creating a base for the brackets and a hoodmold for the tower windows. The roofline of the house is steep and complex, with intersecting sightlines and corners. Windows come in a variety of window shapes and sizes, and the facade is ornamented with panels, band courses, and piers. The current front porch, constructed in 1920, is a wraparound brick porch with a small projecting portico supported by brick columns. 
Inside the house, detailing includes unusual marbleizing and stenciling in the first floor rooms. The front has a terrazzo floor.

Doris Castlerosse

Doris Browne, Viscountess Castlerosse ( Delevingne; 25 September 1900 – 12 December 1942) was an English socialite and the first wife of Valentine Browne, 6th Earl of Kenmare.
Biography.
She was born Jessie Doris Delevingne in Streatham, within the south London borough of Lambeth, the eldest child and only daughter of British-born haberdasher of French origin Edward Charles Delevingne and Jessie Marian ( Homan). 
She entered the family business as a saleswoman of second-hand dresses, serving theatres in London, and as a result met the actress Gertrude Lawrence, who introduced her into London society. Her lovers, prior to her marriage, included Tom Mitford and American millionaire Stephen "Laddie" Sanford.
She met Valentine Browne, known by his title of Viscount Castlerosse, when he was working in London as a celebrity gossip columnist for the Sunday Express. They were married on 16 May 1928, she was thereafter styled Viscountess Castlerosse, becoming familiarly known in society as Doris Castlerosse. Soon afterwards she embarked on an affair with Randolph Churchill, son of the future prime minister.
Her other lovers included society photographer Cecil Beaton, and possibly Winston Churchill according to a British Channel 4 programme. Churchill had met Doris on holidays in the South of France at the Château de l’Horizon, a villa owned by actress Maxine Elliott. Doris was one of many women whose portraits were painted by Churchill. Churchill's former private secretary, Jock Colville, claimed in a 1985 interview with Correlli Barnett that Doris Castlerosse and the future Prime Minister had a four-year affair starting in 1933, however Colville did not become Churchill’s private secretary until 1940, several years after it supposedly took place making the allegations at best second-hand information. Churchill scholar Andrew Roberts has rejected the likelihood that they had an affair adding that "Lady Castlerosse was still legally married to Valentine Castlerosse at the time, the most waspish gossip columnist of the 1930s and the very last person an adulterer would have chosen to cuckold".
The viscount and viscountess were childless, and divorced in 1938, after naming her male friends and escorts as potential co-respondents Viscount Castlerosse chose Robert Heber-Percy, a well-known homosexual whom she was allegedly trying to "cure". 
In 1940, Doris went to the United States, where she found it difficult to resume her earlier career as a courtesan. In 1942, she obtained Winston Churchill's assistance to return to the UK. On her return she was met by her ex-husband, who, according to some sources, hoped to make a fresh start in their relationship. In debt, no longer socially in demand and under police investigation for illegally selling diamonds, she died of an overdose of sleeping pills at the Dorchester Hotel, in London’s Park Lane.
Through her brother Edward Dudley Delevingne, Doris was the great-aunt of models Poppy Delevingne and Cara Delevingne.

Tribotronics

Tribotronics is an area of research that combines machine elements and electronic components to create active tribological systems. This is achieved through continuous monitoring and adjustment of tribosystems, resulting in increased machine efficiency and lifetime.
Definition.
Tribotronics refers to the combined use of tribology and electronics to control tribological systems. Tribotronic systems are designed to improve efficiency, reliability and lifetime of machine elements by active control of tribosystem inputs (such as force, torque, rotational speeds, etc.), outputs (such as motion, changes in energy, etc.) and losses (such as friction, wear, vibrations, etc.). This is in contrast to traditional tribological and mechatronic systems, where losses are seen as a function of system inputs rather than desired set-points. While the term was originally coined with a particular emphasis on the control of tribological losses, it is increasingly used to describe any active system that combines tribological and electronic components, irrespective of the process variables and set-points of the control loop.
Design of tribotronic systems.
One way to design tribotronic systems is to build control loops around passive machine elements (such as gears, fluid bearings and rolling-element bearings) in order to create active machine elements. Relevant process variables (tribosystem inputs, outputs, losses and structure) of the control loop may include:

Salvelinus obtusus

Salvelinus obtusus, commonly called the blunt-nosed Irish charr or blunt-snouted Irish char, is a species of lacustrine char fish in the family Salmonidae, found in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland.
Taxonomy.
Name.
The English word "char[r]" is thought to derive from Old Irish "ceara"/"cera" meaning "[blood] red," referring to its pink-red underside. This would also connect with its Welsh name "torgoch", "red belly."
The species name "obtusus" is Latin for "blunt."
Biology.
"Salvelinus obtusus" is benthopelagic and can grow up to . It is distinguished from other "Salvelinus" in Ireland by its obtuse snout, rounded dorsal profile and short lower jaw, which is included in the upper jaw when the mouth is closed. Its body depth is 20–25% of snout length.
Range.
"Salvelinus obtusus" is only found in Muckross Lake and Lough Leane, and is threatened by eutrophication.
It was formerly found in Lough Tay, Lough Dan, Lough Nalughraman and Lough Acoose, but is now considered extirpated at those sites and is critically endangered.

Operation Excess was a military operation launched by the Rhodesian Security Forces, on 27 July 1968, in response to an incursion of ZIPRA terrorists in Mashonaland West province.
The Operation.
The cadres were detected on 26 July when a Ministry of Internal Affairs (INTAF) employee discovered unfamiliar bootprints in the bush near Makuti. Joint Operations Command (JOC) was moved south-east to Karoi on 28 July, and 2 Commando was deployed there. 3 Commando was sent with Tactical HQ to patrol the Angwa River Bridge, to the north-east, near the border with Mozambique. 
This squad was organised in five sections, three of eight men each and two of seven men each. Heading for Mount Darwin, about north-east of Salisbury, their objective was to subvert local tribesmen and recruit some for training overseas. 
The Support Group, which was already based up at Kanyemba, sent one of its troops into the area along with six Police Anti-Terrorist Unit (PATU) teams. E Company, RAR moved to the west to act as stops. 
7 Troop, 2 Commando and the Support Group troop followed tracks to discover a vacant insurgent camp in the early morning on 28 July; the guerrillas had been made nervous by the increased helicopter activity north of their location and left. 13 Troop found fresh tracks the next morning and followed them. By the end of the operation, the insurgents had taken 23 casualties, 15 killed and 8 captured, for 1 Rhodesian soldier wounded.

The Church of Santa Barbara Vergine e Martire () is a Roman Catholic place of worship, located in the city center of Turin.
History.
The church was originally built within the walls of the Citadel of Turin during the 16th century, however, in 1856, it was demolished along with the citadel itself, because it was too small to be able to keep up with the city center's growing population. Santa Barbara was then rebuilt between 1867 and 1869 under the direction of architect Pietro Carrera, who designed the church in an eclectic style. It was then consecrated in April 1869 by Archbishop Alessandro Ricardi di Netro.

Pelagodinium béii

Pelagodinium béii is a photosynthetic dinoflagellate that forms a symbiotic relationship with planktonic foraminifera.
Discovery and classification.
"P. béii" was originally described as "Gymnodinium béii" by marine isotope geochemist Howard Spero in 1987, after being discovered in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was redefined as "P. béii" in 2010 after its Ribosomal RNA was characterized, revealing it to be a relative of the genus "Symbiodinium". "Symbiodinium" is a well-studied endosymbiont of deep water invertebrates, protists and foraminifera, found especially alongside reef-dwelling organisms.
Ecology.
The "P. béii" contains a single straight elongated apical vesicle with a row of small knobs, eight latitudinal series of amphiesmal vesicles, and a Type E eyespot. When not living as a symbiont the species is able to enter a motile stage.
Like "Symbiodinium", "P. béii" is a member of the Suessiales order, which lack thecal armored plates. "P. béii" is hosted by at least four foraminifera: "G. ruber", "G. conglobatus", "G. sacculifer" and "Orbulina universa".

Kincaid Mackenzie

Alexander Kincaid Mackenzie (1768–1830) was a 19th-century Scottish merchant who served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1817 to 1819.
Life.
He was born in Edinburgh in 1768. It is thought his father died young as his mother "Mrs Mackenzie" is noted as a merchant trading from the Luckenbooths, next to St Giles Cathedral in 1773. There seems a strong likelihood that he was connected to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1776, Alexander Kincaid, who also had premises at the Luckenbooths. Alexander died in 1777 and Thomas may have been his illegitimate son.
By 1800 he was trading as a wine merchant in his own right, from the "head of James Court" on the Lawnmarket.
In 1806 he was living at Buchanan Court in Edinburgh's Old Town. He moved to a new house on Gayfield Square as soon as it was built (c.1808).
In 1810 a public (but anonymous) letter was sent to "Bailie Kincaid Mackenzie" accusing the Edinburgh Town Council of various financial improprieties. In 1818, during his period as Lord Provost, a similar accusation caused him to publish the Council's finances in full.
In 1817, at Gayfield Square, he hosted a visit from Prince Leopold of Belgium, and this name was then used for the mew buildings under construction nearby, at the junction of Leith Walk and London Road, still known as Leopold Place.
He was noted in 1819 as an ex-President of the Edinburgh Magdalene Asylum for Fallen Women.
He died at home, 5 Gayfield Square at the top of Leith Walk on 2 June 1830 aged 62.
He is buried on the central western terrace of New Calton Burial Ground in Edinburgh, facing south to Arthur's Seat, next to the grave of Sir Robert Christison.
Family.
He was married to Catherine Hall (1782-1857). Their children included:

Jay White House

The Jay White House is a single-family home located at 1109 W. Genesee Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
Phineas and Enoch White were two of Lapeer's original pioneering settlers. Jay White, one of their descendants, was born in 1869. This house was apparently constructed for him and his wife, Emma Gale, in 1899 or 1900, when the couple was in Hanover, Germany, serving as US Consul. It was then sold to George H. Cary, the owner of the Marshall Hotel and Livery. A later owner was Raymond T. Carpenter, a clothing merchant.
Description.
The Jay White House is a two-story brick and shingle residence. It is a unique and individualized architectural style, with primarily Romanesque Revival influences. The roof of the house is steeply pitched in the front, running upward from above the front entrance between two side towers. The recessed front entrance porch is reached through a wide but shallow arch, framed with split fieldstones. The massive, squat towers are topped with conical roofs and copper finials. The first floor level is clad in brick, which changes to shingles on the upper portions of the side facades. The windows in the house are all double-hung with the upper sash one-half the height of the lower.

Roxy Roller

"Roxy Roller" is a song written and originally recorded by Sweeney Todd in 1975 with Nick Gilder on vocals. It was written by Jim McCulloch and Nick Gilder. In total four versions of the song were released in 1976:
Canadian success story.
The original version did chart big in Canada, entering during May 1976: the song spent three consecutive weeks at number one in Canada during June and July of 1976. By that time Gilder and McCulloch both had already left the band to pursue a solo career. 
The song is ranked as the fifth biggest Canadian hit of 1976. "Roxy Roller" won a Juno Award for the band.
USA reception.
At first the song didn't catch up with the American public, and Gilder took a chance recording a solo version of the song (released at Chrysalis Records) which however did have a simultaneous release date as the rush release of Sweeney Todd's newly recorded version on which new singer Clark Perry sang lead vocals. Chrysalis Records which had contracted Gilder demanded on his behalf as songwriter imported copies of the original Sweeney Todd's version as well as the newly recorded version to be withdrawn from the market in the U.S. Record stores duly took both singles released by the incarnations of Sweeney Todd from the shelves.
However, the two re-recorded versions of "Roxy Roller" did chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The first cover version with vocals by Clark Perry peaked at #90 and at #97 in the Cash Box Top 100 in late August of 1976. A second re-recorded version which had vocals by Bryan Adams peaked at #99 in mid-September 1976.
Obviously these confusing conditions did prevent any of the four versions of "Roxy Roller" to get enough promotion hence attention in the U.S., at a time when glam rock sounding songs were quite popular.

Produce 101

Produce 101 is a reality television talent competition franchise created by South Korean entertainment conglomerate CJ E&amp;M, based around the formation of a K-pop girl group or boy group. The format is noted for having no panel of judges, employing audience participation to make decisions, as well as for starting with a very large number of competitors, 101, narrowing that number down to the final 11. The franchise began in 2016 and has since expanded to other East Asian countries, China and Japan.
The franchise has attracted a wide following in the world. More than 10 million people cast votes during the finale of Season 2 in 2017, equivalent to a fifth of South Korea's population. In 2018, the eight episodes of "Produce 101 China" attracted more than 4.3 billion views on Tencent Video.
Following the Mnet vote manipulation investigation, on November 14, 2019, producer Ahn Joon-young partially admitted to rigging the votes of all seasons of "Produce 101" during police questioning. He was arrested before over allegations of bribery and fraud in the franchise.
Summary of shows by country.
As of June 13, 2021, there have been 10 groups debuted with 107 members involved in over 3 franchises of "Produce 101".

Gonatopsis japonicus

Gonatopsis japonicus is a species of squid from the family Gonatidae. This species is restricted to the western North Pacific in the seas around the Japanese Archipelago.
Description.
"Gonatopsis japonicus" is a squid with a slender, muscular mantle. It is relatively large with thin fins and a long, pointed tail. The head is wider than the opening of the mantle. It has robust arms that are armed with heavy hooks. These arms are of different lengths, the longest being just over half the length of the mantle. There are five rows of teeth on the radula. Tentacles are absent in adults. It is a large species that grows to a mantle length of 620mm.
Distribution.
"Gonatopsis japonicus" is restricted to the western North Pacific in the Sea of Japan north to the southern Okhotsk Sea and it may also occur off the eastern coast of Japan. It has also been reported from the Kuril Islands east to the central and eastern Bering Sea.
Habitat and biology.
"Gonatopsis japonicus" appears to mature at a relatively small size of approximately 150 mm in mantle length, and this is indicated by the development of hooks on the arms and the drak pigmentation of the beak. This species can be found from the epipelagic zone down into the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, with specimens having been taken from midwater at depths from near the surface to 1000m and from the sea bed at depths from 400m to 2000m. In the Sea of Japan this species was most abundant in the upper 140 m, and its abundance rapidly declined with increasing depth. The regular capturing of juveniles and young adults in the surface layers suggests that this species is an active vertical migrant, it further suggests that its ontogenetic descent takes place relatively late in its life cycle. Most of the specimens taken up to now have been immature or they were newly mature. In the Okhotsk Sea measurements of mature and pre-spawning males from the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones gave mantle lengths which ranged from 278mm to 478mm, while immature and maturing females mantle lengths ranged from 398mm to 582mm. The largest specimen taken had a mantle length of 620mm. As the squid matures the muscle tissues in its body become increasingly gelatinous.
Human use.
"Gonatopsis japonicus" is not utilised by humans.

Romilia gens

The gens Romilia or Romulia was a minor patrician family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are mentioned in the time of the Roman monarchy, and again in the first century of the Republic. Titus Romilius Rocus Vaticanus was consul in 455 BC, and subsequently a member of the first Decemvirate in 451. From this time, the Romilii fell into obscurity for centuries, only to appear briefly in imperial times. A number of Romilii are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The Romilii claimed descent from Romulus, the legendary founder and first King of Rome. Scholars have long disputed the historicity of Romulus, but from the morphology of the nomen Romilius, it seems probable that "Romulus" was an authentic cognomen; "Romilius" belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix "-", which were typically derived from surnames ending in the diminutive suffix "-ulus". The first of this family mentioned in history was Romulius Denter, said to have been appointed praefectus urbi by Romulus himself.
That the Romilii were patricians is inferred from the fact that Vaticanus was consul in 455, while the plebeians were excluded from the consulship until the lex Licinia Sextia of 367 BC; and from his election to the first college of decemvirs, all of whom are supposed to have been patricians. However, historians have long suspected that some of the consuls in the years preceding the Decemvirate were in fact plebeians, and that the consulship was not formally closed to the plebeians until after the decemvirs had been overthrown. A similar objection has been made with respect to the decemvirs; while plebeians are not supposed to have been included in the first college, it has been argued that some of the decemvirs bore plebeian names.
Since the Romilii vanish from history for several centuries after the time of the decemvirs, it may not be possible to prove whether the Romilii were patrician or plebeian. The Romilii mentioned in imperial times may well have been plebeians; but most patrician gentes eventually acquired plebeian branches, often descended from freedmen or newly enfranchised citizens, who assumed the nomina of their patrons.
Praenomina.
The only praenomina associated with the Romilii known from history or inscriptions are "Titus", "Lucius", and "Gaius", all of which were common throughout Roman history.
Branches and cognomina.
"Denter", the cognomen assigned to the first "praefectus urbi", referred to someone with prominent teeth, while "Rocus", from "raucus", designated someone with a loud, deep, or hoarse voice. "Vaticanus" belongs to a class of surnames derived from a person's place of origin or residence, in this case the "Mons Vaticanus", a hill at Rome. "Pollio", the surname of a Romilius who lived in the time of Augustus, was derived from the occupation of the bearer, a polisher of arms or armour.

Due to his profile being raised after increasing the listener figures on his early show by 29%, and also by appearing on Moyles' show, Tarrant moved to the mid-morning slot (10am-1pm) in April 2018, taking over from Jack Saunders.
In October 2018, Tarrant won an episode of the BBC1 show "Pointless" with fellow Radio X DJ Johnny Vaughan (who took over from his dad on the Breakfast Show at Capital).
Personal life.
Tarrant is the youngest son of broadcaster Chris Tarrant who previously presented the breakfast show on Capital FM for 17 years, and his former wife Ingrid. One of Toby’s sisters, Fia, is a fellow radio broadcaster who works for Heart.
Tarrant went to Reed's School in Cobham, Surrey.
Tarrant is a fan of Reading and Liverpool and plays cricket for Surrey side Stoke D'Abernon.
He has been dating Pippa Taylor, the Executive Producer of "The Chris Moyles Show", since July 2017. In 2018, Toby and Pippa moved in together and in order to help furnish the property, Moyles gave the listeners the John Lewis gift list address. By the end of the show, all of the items had been purchased. Pippa announced their engagement on "The Chris Moyles Show" on 20 July 2020.
Tarrant ran the London Marathon for the charity "Make Some Noise" in 2018, achieving a time of 04:35:27 and placed 12,279th. He raised over £31,000 for his efforts. One of the main reasons for the high total was due to his agreement with Moyles that he would cycle around Leicester Square naked if he raised over £30,000.

Hallmark Playhouse

Hallmark Playhouse is an American old-time radio dramatic anthology series. It was broadcast on CBS from June 10, 1948 until February 1, 1953, and was described by one author as "a program that consistently produced the highest levels of production quality and value." Beginning on February 8, 1953, the program underwent changes of title, host, and format. It was broadcast as The Hallmark Hall of Fame until March 27, 1955, still on CBS.
Playhouse format.
"Hallmark Playhouse" began as a summer replacement for "Radio Reader's Digest", which Hallmark had also sponsored. Company officials decided to keep it for the fall of 1948 and drop its predecessor. An article in the trade publication "Billboard" reported that Hallmark executives preferred not to continue sharing product identification with "Reader's Digest". The new show broadcast adaptations of works — some obscure and some well-known — from drama and literature.
Personnel.
James Hilton was the host of "Hallmark Playhouse". Hollywood stars often had leading roles in episodes. Among those starring were Ethel Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Joan Fontaine, Gregory Peck, and Jane Wyman. Frank Gast was the announcer. Lyn Murray provided the music. Dee Engelbach and Bill Gay were the producers. Writers included Jack Rubin and Jean Holloway.
Episodes.
In the reference work "On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio," radio historian John Dunning wrote that host Hilton would choose material to be adapted for the broadcasts: "Hilton announced plans to 'ransack' the past and search out never-before-broadcast tales from the 2,000-year history of written literature." That goal was missed, however, at the beginning; "The Devil and Daniel Webster", by Stephen Vincent Benét was the program's premiere episode, and it had already been presented on radio by "Columbia Workshop."
"The Story of Silent Night", presented in 1946 was cited by John V. Pavlik in his book, "Masterful Stories: Lessons from Golden Age Radio". "History comes alive," Pavlik wrote, "through the production's rigorous research, splendid dialogue, and beautiful orchestrations, including acoustical guitar and song, especially as sung by a children's group." He added that the episode's musical arrangements and orchestrations "underscore the extraordinary resources, intellectual capital, and pure talent that went into creating a program such as the "Hallmark Playhouse" ..."
Other stories adapted for the program included "Penny Serenade", "Pride and Prejudice", "The Citadel", and "Parnassus on Wheels."
Hall of Fame.
Unlike the focus on classical literature and drama of its predecessor, "Hallmark Hall of Fame" featured stories about people from America's past. Subjects of episodes included Lee de Forest and Mary Todd Lincoln.
Personnel.
Lionel Barrymore was the host of "Hallmark Hall of Fame". Frank Goss was the announcer, and Bill Gay directed.
Critical reception.
In the September 15, 1951, issue of "Billboard", Bob Francis reviewed the opening episode of the 1951–1952 season of "Hallmark Playhouse", an adaptation of J. M. Barrie's "Quality Street" that starred Deborah Kerr. Francis wrote, "The air adaptation was exceedingly
well put together, keeping the story line clear and retaining the quaint flavor of the original Barrie lines." He also commended the program's advertising, writing that Hallmark commercials "were well-spaced and timed — dignified attention-getters without distracting from the interest in the story."
Recognition.
In 1952, "Hallmark Playhouse" was among the winners of Radio Honor Medals from the Freedoms Foundation.

N11 highway (Philippines)

National Route 11 (N11) is an major primary route that forms part of the Philippine highway network. It is a component and the main route of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5), connecting the cities of Taguig, Makati, Pasig and Quezon.
History.
When the routes were assigned by the Department of Public Works and Highways, the segment of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) from Taguig to Quezon City, except for its at-grade section below the Bagong Ilog Flyover in Pasig, was assigned as N11. These roads under C-5 include the Carlos P. Garcia Avenue, Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue, Bonny Serrano Avenue, and Katipunan Avenue.
Description.
The route’s northern terminus starts from a route change from N129 while making a junction on C.P. Garcia Avenue, a tertiary road in Barangay U.P. Campus, Quezon City. It traverses to the cities of Quezon, Pasig, Makati and Taguig. The highway is then carried by the Bagong Ilog Flyover in Pasig as it parallels another C-5 route (N141) below the flyover. After reaching Taguig, the route meets the respective interchanges of C-5 Southlink Expressway and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) before its southern terminus at the East Service Road, a frontage road of the Skyway At-Grade section of SLEX.

Ayahs' Home

The Ayahs' Home, London, provided accommodation for Indian ayahs and Chinese amahs (nannies) at the turn of the 20th century who were "ill-treated, dismissed from service or simply abandoned" with no return passage to their home country. The Home also operated like an employment exchange to help ayahs find placements with families returning to India. It was the only institution of its type in Britain with a named building. 
In 2020 the former site on King Edward Road, Hackney was shortlisted for a Blue Plaque following an application by local resident Farhanah Mamoojee. Following this, Farhanah organised an event on 7 March 2020 at Hackney Museum, supported by the Mayor of Hackney, to draw further attention to the hidden history of the Ayahs and Amahs, which consisted of a panel discussion with academic Rozina Visram, as well as a poetry workshop and spoken word performance by The Yoniverse Collective, [extensive coverage was featured in The Hackney Post]. The event gained national and international press via BBC World Service, The Guardian, ITV News London and Business Insider (Mumbai) The history of the Ayahs, and the Ayahs’ Home, is gaining popularity and further coverage via the Ayahs’ Home Instagram page.
Background.
Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the East India Company was abolished and its powers transferred to the British Crown under the Government of India Act 1858. This resulted in a large number of British families travelling between the two countries. Many of these families employed local servants as they were cheaper than British staff. Among them were ayahs, the most highly prized being the sophisticated "Madrassi ayahs". Some ayahs were experienced travellers and advertised their services in newspapers. Travelling ayahs were seen as "honest, clean, capable nurses and made good sailors".
The British public were captivated by the picturesque ayahs shown in paintings and books. The ayah would accompany the British family back to England, either on the seasonal trips to escape the Indian summer or on retirement of the colonial official. These journeys were more frequent after 1869 with the introduction of steam-powered ships and regular passenger services such as those provided by P&amp;O. The journey was shortened by 4,500 miles after the Suez Canal opened in 1869, with the effect that up to 140 travelling ayahs visited England every year with their employing families, memsahibs and children. Some may have had a sense of adventure, but they were vulnerable to the whims of their erstwhile employers. Without official contracts or guarantees for return passages, some ayahs then had their employment terminated or were abandoned, forcing them to live in squalor or to beg. Others found alternative employment to pay for return journeys or stayed in Britain.
Origins.
The exact date and method of establishment of the Ayahs' Home is unclear. Evidence from the India Office gives a foundation date of 1825; however, it has also been said to have been founded in 1891 by Mr and Mrs Rogers at 6 Jewry Street, Aldgate. It appears to have been closed prior to 1891 due to administrative inadequacies, but, in response to the lobbying of a committee of white British women, the foreigners' branch committee of the London City Mission (LCM) took it over and prevented its permanent closure. Around 1900, the Home moved to 26 King Edward Road, Mare Street, Hackney, and in 1921, requiring more space, it moved to the larger 4 King Edward Road. The new home was opened by Lady Chelmsford, wife of Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, the former Viceroy of India.
Early years.
Regarded as a "symbol of empire" and a "home from home", around 100 ayahs stayed at the Home each year. The residents were mainly nurse-maids from India and other countries including China, Java and Malaya. Socio-political changes created variations in numbers, with a higher occupancy during the Indian summer when many British families returned to escape the heat. The home was almost unoccupied from November to March. It was busier during the First World War when sea travel was banned for women, with a resulting increase in the number of stranded ayahs. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, 223 Ayahs were recorded at the Home as families rushed back to England at the first opportunity. The number of occupants was less during the depression of the 1930s. The length of stay varied from weeks to months.
Despite the lack of any testimonies from the ayahs, it is known that they were typically older women, used to childcare responsibilities and able to fit into both the English and Indian worlds. Life in the Home was an amalgamation of oriental and western tradition, with Indian food, the playing of "pachis", embroidery and outings to places of interest such as Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace.
The Home generated income by the resale of the ayah's ticket, public donations, fundraising events and the sale of handwork done by the ayahs. A deficit in finances by 1917, when the war prolonged occupancy, led the Home's administrator to apply to the India Office for assistance. Initially hesitant, by 1928 the office was making an annual contribution to the Home.
Matron's testimony.
In 1910, Mrs Dunn, the matron of the Home, gave evidence to the Committee on Distressed Colonial and Indian Subjects of the India Office. Dunn described how the system depended on the ayah's return ticket. The employer who released the ayah from duties once in Britain typically purchased the ayah's return ticket, which was transferred to the Home. The ticket was then "sold" to a family wanting the ayah's services; the Home used the money from the sale to pay for the ayah's accommodation until she departed. According to her evidence, the Home had been established by a committee of women who had realised there should be a shelter for abandoned ayahs in England.
Among the evidence that was given by Mrs Dunn and also recorded in correspondence between the Home and the India Office was of an ayah who was brought to England from Bombay by a British woman in 1908, who, in the usual manner, released her to Thomas Cook and Son in order to transfer her employment. Re-employed by the Drummond family of Edinburgh who had pledged her return to India, she was abandoned at London's King's Cross Station, leaving her with one pound after two weeks work. The ayah arrived at the Thomas Cook office, which then directed her to the Home. Not in the custom of taking in destitute women, Mrs Dunn successfully obtained compensation from the India Office.
Missionary activity.
The Home was a converting station for missionaries to introduce the ayahs to Christianity. "Foreigners' Fetes" were frequently organised by the Foreigner's Branch Committee of the LCM, which was supported by Christian missionaries. Religious services were held daily, hymns were taught and religious "chats in the bedroom" which the matron felt were "productive of much good", were part of daily life at the Home. This all principally stemmed from the perception of ayahs as "child-like".
Demonstrating a "domestic ideal and moral framework", the parlour of the Home was depicted in Alec Robert's "Living London" article "Missionary London", with a group of women looking busy sewing and reading. Expressing Christian charity for the benefit of the ayahs' welfare and the British empire, the Home encouraged the ayahs to show gratitude and loyalty.
Joseph Salter was the missionary responsible for the Home. He was the missionary to the Strangers' Home for Asiatics on behalf of London City Mission and experienced from working with lascars and spoke several Indian languages.

Gilbert Grandval

Gilbert Grandval (born Gilbert Hirsch, subsequently Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff: 12 February 1904 – 29 November 1981) was a French Resistance activist who went on to become the military governor of the Saar Protectorate in 1945. He remained in post for a decade, although the nature of the job evolved and there were changes of title in 1948 and again in 1952 when he became, formally, the French ambassador to the Saarland. Subsequently, he became a government minister during the early years of the Fifth Republic.
Gilbert Grandval was the alias Hirsch-Ollendorff used from approximately 1943 while working with the Resistance. Subsequently, he was authorized permanently to substitute the Grandval name for the family name with which he had been born, both on his own account and on behalf of his father. The authorization came from a decree signed on 25 February 1946 by the President of the postwar provisional government, and officially transcribed at the appropriate town hall on 12 March 1948.
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Yves Gilbert Edmond Hirsch was born at his parents' home along the Rue La Boétie in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Edmond Hirsch (1873-), his father, was a book dealer who expanded the family business to include a publisher of school books. Gilbert's grandfather, Henri Hirsch (1829-) had also been a book dealer. The Hirsch family traced their origins back to Strasbourg, but after the frontier changes of 1871 they were given and took up the option of retaining French citizenship, which meant leaving Alsace.
His mother, born Jeanne Ollendorff (1880-), was the daughter of (1851-1920), another book dealer, and a publisher who numbered Guy de Maupassant among his authors. It may have been on account of the name recognition than the Ollendorff family enjoyed that while he was still a child the family took to using the family name Hirsch-Ollendorff.
Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was born into a Jewish family but with the post-revolutionary French state deeply committed to "Laïcité" he seems to have been able to carry his religion lightly: at some stage he converted to Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, as Gilbert grew up the family was part of the city's Jewish intellectual community: their social circle included the family of Léon Blum, who also traced his family origins back to Alsace.
He received his schooling at the prestigious Lycée Condorcet, close to the family home. In compliance with his family's wishes he then embarked on the study of medicine. That study was interrupted between 1924 and 1926 when he was required to perform military service. He never returned to medicine. Instead he used his contacts to find work with , a major manufacturer of chemicals and glass-based products. He rose quickly through management ranks to become a sales director with the fertilizers division, based in Lyon. During the 1930s, like many upwardly mobile young executives, he obtained a pilot's license, apparently from motives which were, at the time, purely recreational and social.
War and resistance.
France declared war on Germany, in response to the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, in September 1939. Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was by now an experienced pilot. He was almost immediately conscripted into the Air Force and given the rank of " lieutenant". He was deployed in a reconnaissance squadron and later as a fighter pilot in northern France. The German invasion was launched on 10 May 1940 and ended six weeks later in France's military defeat on 22 June. The southern half of France was placed under the administration of an (initially semi-autonomous) puppet government while the northern half of the country was placed under direct military occupation. Gilbert Hirsch-Ollendorff was demobilised and on 17 August 1940 returned to work in the .
Général de Gaulle's famous rallying speech was transmitted from London on 18 June 1940, and during the same month Hirsch-Ollendorff made contact. He became a member of the Ceux de la Résistance ("Those of the Resistance" / CDLR) group in 1941. Although, in the first instance, he retained doubts about the Resistance, one of his early assignments involved finding more recruits for it. From 9 June 1942, threatened with Gestapo persecution, he "disappeared underground". In November of that same year he became the CDLR's head of military organisation in the area designated by the movement as "Region C", which comprised eight eastern departments including three - those comprising Alsace-Moselle - that for historical and linguistic reasons the Germans were treating as fully integrated parts of the German state (Gau Baden-Elsaß and Gau Westmark). Most of the rest of "Region C" was defined by the Germans as the "Forbidden zone" "Zone interdite", subjected to tighter military control and a more punitive régime in respect of the civilian population than most of occupied France. On 6 August 1943, while on a trip to Paris, he was arrested by German occupation troops. He was released two days later "for lack of evidence against him". After this his commitment to the Resistance was evidently total. He used a range of cover names: "Chancel", "Pasteur", "Berger", "Planète" and "Grandval". He was seen to be acquiring enhanced leadership potential, with an intimate appreciation of the organisation's structures and hierarchies. Additional military responsibilities arrived in due course along with promotion to the rank of colonel. Within resistance circles Grandval (as he increasingly came to be known among comrades) was identified, like his direct superior in the resistance organisation, General Kœnig, as a committed de Gaulle loyalist. Another senior resistance member in the region with whom he worked on the national directorate of the CDLR was the future prime minister, Michel Debré.
France's liberation arrived from the west, with Paris freed during the final part of August 1944. The Provisional Government under Charles de Gaulle established itself in Paris on 25 August 1944. In Lorraine the important city of Nancy was liberated by the Third United States Army a month later. It is claimed that two days before the American army entered the city itself Grandval with his resistance forces had already extinguished the last remnants of the German military presence, but the truth of the matter is hard to pin down. There certainly was an ongoing fractiousness between Grandval and US military officers whom he came across during his subsequent career. De Gaulle visited the city on 25 September 1944 and personally greeted local resistance leaders including Grandval, on whom he conferred the Order of the Liberation. It was Grandval's first encounter with the General whom over the previous four years he had known only as a familiar voice emerging through the crackling of radio waves. Grandval could now style himself a Companion of the Liberation. In 1946 he was also made a Knight of the Legion of Honour.
On 25 September 1944. at de Gaulle's insistence, , the Minister for War in the new government, appointed Grandval as military commander of the 20th Military Region (i.e. the Nancy region). He gained valuable experience, reconfiguring the local resistance era "Forces of the Interior" into appropriate postwar military structures, and also rebuilding the underpinnings of civil society which during the occupation years had fallen into the hands of now discredited Vichy officials. With something approaching postwar normality appearing on the horizon, Grandval let his family know that he was preparing for a return to civilian life and the world of business. That was not to be, however.
Saar protectorate.
With the western two thirds of Germany after May 1945 divided into four military occupation zones, de Gaulle's plans for Grandval involved appointing him military governor in Baden-Baden, as "right-hand" to General Kœnig, with whom he had already worked very closely during the closing months of the war. Grandval was not interested in such a political-diplomatic posting, however. Plans were then developed for him to be offered the military governorship of the Saarland, a highly industrialised region with a unique political and economic status, where it was felt that Grandval's hands-on experience of the industrial sector could be particularly valuable. The region's mines were seen by the French government as a valuable source of future war reparations. Grandval took some persuading, and indeed sought the advice of his old family friend Léon Blum. However, he accepted and on 30 August 1945 was appointed as France's Military Governor ("Délégué Supérieur") of the region, taking up his posting on 7 September 1945. His mandate from the head of the French government was to establish a special administrative dispensation, as far as possible with the consent of the population. Looking ahead, it was hoped that in the event of another referendum on the matter, voters in the Saarland might be persuaded to back union with France in preference to a return to a German state. Grandval expected to remain in post for a few months, at most half a year.
As early as March 1945, in a telephone call, , had impressed on Grandval the importance the French president attached to establishing a significant French military presence in the Saar region. De Gaulle had backed up his wish by sending two battalions of the 26th Infantry Regiment towards the Saar and Palatinate regions. These had found their movements held up by the Americans, but on 10 April, when he inspected French troops at Scheidt, Grandval was able to report back that "the Americans were there, but the French were there too, as Général de Gaulle wished". In persuading the American commanders on the ground to comply with the government level decisions concerning French military administration being applied in the French military occupation zone, he exercised a range of political and human negotiating skills, and he was also able to see to it that for the important coal mines to be restarted, it would be necessary for the Americans military personnel to relinquish control in favour of specialists from the French Mines Commission.
Despite the military nature of his posting, Grandval's preoccupations were increasingly with tangible fundamentals of the region's civilian economy: coal, steel and reconstruction. During a brief visit in May 1945, prior to his appointment he had determined that these were the most urgent concerns. Industry had to be restarted to boost the desperately depressed regional economy and restore people's livelihoods. That would also ensure war reparations to France (chiefly in the form of brown coal). He invited the Paris government to entrust him with doing what was necessary, and that is what happened.
At the end of 1947 a was implemented in the Saarland. Preparation of the constitution had involved extensive wrangling between the wartime allies, but the appointment of Gilbert Grandval as High Commissioner, following the abolition of the post of Military Governor for the region, provided an element of continuity. His reports to Paris went now not to the Ministry for War but to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His main task was to ensure that the passed no resolutions or laws that might endanger the region's autonomy (in relation to West Germany) or jeoparise the economic customs union with France.
His title changed again on 25 January 1952, when the French government appointed Grandval as Ambassador and Head of the French Diplomatic Mission to the Saar Protectorate. By this time, with cold war tensions intensifying on the far side of Germany, the French government, taking its lead from western allies, was developing a more collaborational relationship with the western occupation zones of Germany which had been relaunched, in May 1949, as the German Federal Republic ("Bundesrepublik Deutschland" / West Germany). Despite his new title, Grandval was still mandated to appeal against any new changes in law proposed by the , if he thought the autonomous relationship of the region in relation to West Germany, or its customs union with France, were challenged. In 1954 he moved his ambassador's office to a designed for the purpose by Georges-Henri Pingusson. Grandval's ten-year stay in Saarbrücken was by now entering its final phase: it is not known whether he ever took the opportunity to move his family home from , on the southside of the city, where the Grandvals had lived since 1946, to the massive concrete building in the city centre.
On 25 January 1955 the West German ambassador in Paris, Herbert Blankenhorn (who was known to be a close confidant of Chancellor Adenauer) agreed with , France's deputy cabinet head, that Grandval's Saarland posting should end three months before the Saar Statute referendum, scheduled for October of that year. It was widely (but wrongly) anticipated that voters would back a settlement that gave the region autonomy under the auspices of the Western European Union, while retaining its postwar economic and customs union with France. Grandval's successor would be Eric de Carbonnel, a career diplomat and a less forceful personality. A valedictory reception was held on 30 June 1955, featuring a moving speech by Grandval himself. His mission, he said, had been "one of the most uplifting tasks that could be given to any Frenchman" ("eine der erhebendsten Aufgaben, die heute einem Franzosen gestellt werden können").
Towards the Fifth Republic.
There followed a brief posting as French Résident général in Morocco. This appointment had become public knowledge because of an article in Der Spiegel back in April 1954. The Sultan had fiercely objected on account of Grandval's presumed Judaism. The posting nevertheless went ahead, formally with effect from 20 June 1955. However, Grandval resigned after fifty-five days over "differences" with the policies of the led by Edgar Faure.
In September 1958 he was appointed to a government position as Secretary of State for the , in succession to . He remained in this post for more than two years: the period was one of . Gilbert Grandval, like many of his generation, retained a deep personal and political loyalty towards Général de Gaulle, who during this period returned to power and inaugurated the "Fifth Republic". Grandval saw himself as a "lefwing Gaullist" and was a founder member of a new political party, the which was a slightly incongruous (and, as an independent party, short-lived) alternative to the mainstream Gaullist Union for the New Republic (" L'Union pour la nouvelle République" / UNR) party. The UDT was notable for containing "strong personalities", but gained little traction with the electorate.
On 14 April 1962 he was appointed Secretary of state (junior minister) for in the under Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. That appointment was of short duration, however, since on 15 May 1962 he entered Pompidou's cabinet, taking over from Paul Bacon as Minister of Labour. A new government took over on 8 January 1966, putting an end to Grandval's ministerial career. There now came a return to the private section in July 1966 when he became president of the venerable Messageries Maritimes shipping company. He retired from the position in 1972.
After his departure from government, Grandval remained politically engaged. In 1971 he became chair of the "Union Travailliste", a new breakaway faction within the Gaullist political family of little long-term significance.

Attack on Whistlefield Farm

Late on 22 December 1972, a troop from the Rhodesian Special Air Service, followed shortly by the Rhodesian Light Infantry, reported to the police station in Centenary. The land mine in Altena's driveway was discovered, disarmed and removed. For their own safety, Marc de Borchgrave and his family were sent to Whistlefield Farm, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family, while their family home was being repaired.
Having been alerted to the de Borchgraves' new location through sympathetic farmworkers, guerrillas from the original cadre requested permission from ZANLA to carry out another attack. After ZANLA's area commanders in Centenary had been consulted, a raid on the second target (Whistlefield Farm) was planned.
The Raid.
At about one o'clock on the morning of 23 December, the insurgents reconnoitred Whistlefield Farm and shelled the structure with mortar fire. An RPG-7 was aimed into the bedroom in which de Borchgrave was sleeping. The rocket hit the window frame and lightly wounded the tobacco farmer, his nine-year-old daughter Anne, and de Borchgrave. The ZANLA cadres then retreated and hid themselves. News of the second attack reached Second Lieutenant Ian Buttenshaw and Sachse around midnight, and they deployed immediately, but having discovered a mine near Altena they disembarked from the vehicles 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from Whistlefield and made the final approach on foot. Anne was evacuated by helicopter as the RLI and SAS secured the area for the night.
The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two tracking teams arrived at Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one was from the SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while the other was a British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.
In their haste, Nhongo's cadres had not attempted to conceal their tracks as they headed west, towards the Musengezi river—Buttenshaw's pursuant RLI men therefore realised how quickly the guerrillas were moving and sped up their chase. The Rhodesians stopped for the night in a rocky area near a stream, replenished their scanty water supply and continued at dawn. About half an hour after setting off they crossed a vlei to discover a recently vacated guerrilla camp. "The fire was still burning and the food still warm," Buttenshaw writes. "From the abandoned kit a hurried departure appeared evident." Support was summoned from the SAS, who were tasked to set up stops along the Musengezi to the west. Buttenshaw's men reached the top of the Musengezi valley to see Rhodesian helicopters dropping the SAS soldiers at regular intervals along the river, as well as the ZANLA cadres, who were moving straight towards one of the SAS stops. The stop opened fire and killed some; the rest of the guerrillas scattered and ran. Buttenshaw's RLI men were then withdrawn from the follow-up for a day and a half and placed in stop positions. The chase was temporarily taken over by the SAS under Lieutenant Chris Schulenburg before Buttenshaw's men returned on 30 December 1972. Soon after setting out that morning they discovered an unarmed, wounded ZANLA fighter who had been shot in the arm by the SAS in the initial contact two days earlier. He had hidden himself after being abandoned by his comrades, and since then had lost a great deal of blood.
After two years of patient preparation, the farm attacks by ZANLA near Centenary marked the effective start of its "Second "Chimurenga"" against the Rhodesian government.
Aftermath.
The effectiveness of ZANLA's adopted Maoist tactics was demonstrated in particular by the element of surprise they were now able to use against the security forces, and by the ability they had achieved to melt seamlessly into the local population between strikes. The rural black people in the north-east of the country were now, almost totally subverted and intimidated" by ZANLA and provided the guerrillas with food, shelter and manpower. Rather than having the tribesmen actively volunteer information about insurgent movements and locations, as had happened during previous infiltrations, the Rhodesian Security Forces now met an increasingly silent and sometimes hostile welcome from the rural blacks. More farm attacks took place over the following weeks, during December 1972 and January 1973, leading the security forces to set up Operation Hurricane in northern Mashonaland. This counter-insurgency operation would continue right up to 1980. "It was the start of a whole new ball game," writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. "The war proper had started."
Six huts and a mosque in the farmworkers' compound were torched during the skirmish, although accounts differ on who started the fire.

Common Cause (South Australia)

Common Cause was an organisation formed during the Second World War to consider post-war reconstruction and society. It became a popular movement but was tainted by accusations of Communism.
History.
Common Cause was founded in 1943 as a vehicle for a number of idealistic community leaders of diverse backgrounds to discuss the post-war economic and social future of South Australia. Charter members were:
The idealistic aims of the organisation found favour with a large section of the community, disenchanted by the Great Depression and tired of the war and looking forward to a future of industrial peace and prosperity.
A. J. Hannan of Medindie (the Crown Solicitor) was a prominent critic, accusing it of being either a Communist front organisation or susceptible to takeover by Communists by virtue of its open membership and support by the Union movement. Rev. E. S. Kiek of Parkin College made a passionate defence of Common Cause, and was supported by large number of ministers of religion who were also members.
At its first Annual General Meeting K. S. Isles, was re-elected president; vice presidents elected were A. B. Thompson and G. V. Portus; hon. treasurer L. J. Mulroney; minute secretary Maurice Brown; executive council Sidney Crawford, A. A. Drummond, Mrs. Fairbank, T. Garland, Mrs. K. S. Isles, J. H. Knight, and Dr. J. Lugg. They had a meeting room on Waymouth Street.
The organisation helped found a kindergarten and community centre at Nuriootpa, a town with a well-developed community spirit, and where the aims of Common Cause were particularly welcomed. In 1944 Common Cause published a booklet "A Township starts to live : the valley of Barossa : South Australia's new community." Crawford, a prime mover in its foundation, retired shortly after.
Isles resigned as president on the eve of his departure for London on Army business.
Common Cause disbanded in 1949.

2017–18 Baltimore Blast season

The 2017–18 Baltimore Blast season is the twenty-sixth season of the Baltimore Blast professional indoor soccer club. The Blast, an Eastern Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, play their home games at SECU Arena in Towson, Maryland.
The team is led by owner Edwin F. Hale, Sr. and head coach Danny Kelly. The Blast entered the season as defending champions as they defeated the Sonora Suns in the Ron Newman Cup finals in April 2017 for the second consecutive season.
Following a 6-5 victory on February 10 over the Milwaukee Wave, Baltimore clinched a playoff berth in the Eastern Division for the 2018 Ron Newman Cup playoffs. The Blast then clinched the regular-season Eastern Division championship after an 8-7 overtime win over the Florida Tropics on February 24. The Blast finished the regular season 17-5 and defeated Syracuse, Milwaukee and Monterrey in the postseason, successfully defending their title en route to the team's tenth championship (including one won by the original Blast franchise). William Vanzela received the MASL Final MVP.
History.
Launched in July 1992 as the Baltimore Spirit, an expansion team in the second National Professional Soccer League for the 1992–93 season, the team replaced the original Baltimore Blast which folded earlier in 1992 when the first Major Indoor Soccer League shut down. Ed Hale, an owner of the original Blast, bought the Spirit in July 1998 and changed the name to Baltimore Blast. In 2001, the team was a founding member of the second MISL. When that league shut down in 2008, they co-founded the National Indoor Soccer League which, one season later, became the third MISL.
After the 2013-14 season, Baltimore was one of three teams that left the MISL, leading to the league's collapse. Along with five other former MISL teams, the Blast joined the teams of the Professional Arena Soccer League, which was then rebranded as the Major Arena Soccer League. The MASL Eastern Division for the 2017-18 season remains unchanged from the previous season, consisting of the defending MASL Ron Newman Cup Champion Baltimore Blast, former MISL club Syracuse Silver Knights, former PASL club Harrisburg Heat, and the Florida Tropics.
Off-field moves.
The Blast announced in August 2017 that they would move from the Royal Farms Arena to the SECU Arena on the campus of Towson University, beginning in the 2017-2018 MASL season. The move will be the first time the Blast franchise will play home games in an arena other than the Royal Farms Arena.

Maxime Old

Maxime Old (1910–1991) was a French interior architect and furniture designer. He is known for his numerous works of art, and as forerunner of the transition from the style of the 30s to modern design. Yves Badetz, chief curator at the Orsay Museum, in charge of decorative arts, confesses that “The emotions you feel when looking at Maxime Old’s creations are intense. His thoughtful esthetics freely associates the values of the rational of Bauhaus with Ruhlmann's demand for perfection. His talent is to design the refined outlines anticipating the third millennium."
Biography.
Family History.
Maxime Old has been born in Maisons-Alfort (Val-de-Marne) in 1910. He is coming from a long line of master cabinetmakers. His father, Louis Old is the son of Jean Léonard (Johann Leonhard) Old, Germany originated, master cabinetmaker. Louis marries Maximillienne, daughter of Joseph (Giuseppe) Carosi, master cabinetmaker, originated from Italy. Working as a team, they decide to fuse the two workshops together to make 37 Rue Chanzy Paris, a workshop that Louis Old will then manage himself. With the help of his spouse and approximately 15 employees at the time, Louis Old realises furniture in order to be sold to furniture stores, as well as individuals.
Education.
After studying four years at l’Ecole Boulle, Maxime Old graduates top of the year and transfers directly to Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann design team, where he collaborates until the end in 1934. These two great experiences gave him a different perspective, installed a certain demanding nature in him, new techniques, and knowledge, that will then help him transform the family business into a world-renowned decorative art name.
Initial works and recognition.
In 1934, when J.E. Rulhman dies, his company is close as he ordered it. His customers in contact with Maxime ask him to continue to work for them. Maxime goes back to its family cabinetmaker workshop and turn it round to satisfy this demanding private customer base. Maxime Old quickly develops an elegant, modern style that fits with the demanding requests of his clientele: Industries, politicians, lawyers, doctor etc... He designs and produces art furniture embedded in interior architecture innovative master plans.
He is particularly known for his elegant transformative pieces of furniture. He has been said the "sofabed inventor"!
In 1939 Maxime Old exhibits his works at the International Exhibition New-York World's Fair.
Until the 1960s, he participates in all of the « Artistes Decorateurs » and "Salons des Arts Ménagers" exhibitions, where many of his art pieces are awarded. This success brings the grand opening of his gallery on Avenue Hoche in Paris in order to exhibit his art, and help young prodigies be recognized by the art world.
Several schools such as the "Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Decoratifs" requested his teaching in art furniture design, he headed the decorative architecture PHD of the school.
Institutional works.
More and more, simultaneously to his production for private customers, Maxime Old develops his interior architect activity focused on institutional large customers: prestigious ocean liners such as the "SS France (1961)", embassies, famous hotels, large company headquarters, business banks, airports, city halls even presidential palaces, both in France and in other countries.
For these large projects he provides both the overall interior master plan and the all individual pieces of furniture of his own design. He experiences innovative techniques and new materials beside traditional ones to achieve creative functional designs. The professional press points out the consistency of these major work of art.
Modern his style is, modern his thinking is! Beside his prestigious unique pieces Maxime studies models for optimized editions. He teaches it, but never practices it on a large scall basis out of his own control. He was too much a perfectionist to give up.
In 19?? Maxime is awarded Chevalier of the French Academy of Arts and Letters. equivalent to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
In 1954, he is awarded Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.

Juglans hopeiensis

Juglans hopeiensis (), also known as Ma walnut, is a species of walnut native to northern Hebei Province. Some scholars believe that the species is a hybrid of Juglans regia and Juglans mandshurica. Currently, it is a threatened tree species. 
Historically, Ma walnut was originally distributed in the Northern Taihang Mountains of Hebei Province, so it was called Hebei walnut (河北核桃). This species is mainly distributed in some mountainous areas of Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Beijing and Tianjin in China.
Morphological characteristics.
Ma walnut, whose scientific name is "Juglans hopeiensis Hu", is a plant belonging to the genus Juglans of the family Juglandaceae. The plant can reach up to 2.5 meters high and often grow in high mountains. Its bark is gray-white with longitudinal cracks.
Discovery and Naming.
In 1930, Zhou Hanfan (周汉藩) discovered this new species in Banjiegou, Xiakou Village, Changping County, Hebei Province (now part of Beijing). Subsequently, one strain of the species was found in each of Jixian, Mentougou, and Lianhua Mountain.
In 1934, the new species was first described by the Chinese botanist Hu Xiansu (better known as H. H. Hu) in his paper entitled "Notulae systematicae ad Florem Sinensium V". He originally indicated that the species was known locally as "Mahetao" (i.e. Ma walnut) and was once quite commonly cultivated, but it subsequently became less popular.
In 1981, several plants of Ma walnut were found again in Bancheng District, Lishui County, Hebei Province.
The name of the species was verified by AAS Systematic Botanist on October 15, 1998.

League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC

League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines about the validity of the cityhood laws of sixteen municipalities in the Philippines. The case clarifies the requirements for the conversion of a Municipality into a Component City. The Court in its final decision ruled that the cityhood laws of the sixteen municipalities in the Philippines are constitutional.
Background and history.
In the Eleventh Congress, 57 bills seeking the conversion of municipalities into component cities were filed before the House of Representatives. However, Congress did not act on the 24 out of the 57 municipalities. In the Twelfth Congress, Republic Act No. 9009 was enacted revising the Local Government Code (LGC) by increasing the income requirement to qualify for conversion into a city from ₱20 million annual income to ₱100 million locally generated income. In the thirteenth Congress, 16 of the 24 municipalities filed their individual cityhood bills. Each of the cityhood bills contained a common provision exempting the particular municipality from the ₱100 million income requirement imposed by RA No. 9009. These cityhood bills lapsed into law on various dates after President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo did not sign them.
Petitioners filed to declare the Cityhood Laws unconstitutional for violation of Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, as well as for violation of the equal protection clause. Petitioners also pointed that the wholesale conversion of municipalities into cities will reduce the share of existing cities in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) because more cities will share the same amount of internal revenue set aside for all cities under Section 285 of the Local Government Code.
The municipalities involved were called as "League of 16". They were:
Decision.
On November 8, 2008, the Court, by a vote of 6–5, held that the exemptions in the Cityhood Laws were unconstitutional because Sec. 10, Art. X of the Constitution requires that such exemption must be written into the LGC and not into any other laws. The Court stated that the Cityhood Laws violate sec. 6, Art. X of the Constitution for they prevent a fair and just distribution of the national taxes to local government units. It further held that the criteria, as prescribed in the LGC, must be strictly followed because such criteria are material in determining the “just share” of local government units (LGUs) in national taxes.
On March 31, 2009, the Court, by a vote of 7–5, denied the first motion for reconsideration. The second motion for reconsideration was denied on April 28, 2009.
On December 21, 2009, the Court, by a vote of 6-4 reversed its November 18, 2008 decision and declared the Cityhood Laws as constitutional. It ruled that based on the deliberations of the Congress and the intent of the same was that the then pending cityhood bills would be outside the pale of the minimum income requirement of ₱100 million that Senate Bill No. 2159 proposes; and that RA 9009 would not have any retroactive effect insofar as the cityhood bills are concerned. It also held that the conversion of a municipality into a city will only affect its status as a political unit, but not its property as such, it added. Furthermore, it stressed that respondent LGUs were qualified cityhood applicants before the enactment of RA 9009 for to impose on them the much higher income requirement after what they have gone through would appear to be indeed unfair. Thus, the imperatives of fairness dictate that they should be given a legal remedy by which they should be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status using the criteria set forth under the LGC of 1991 prior to its amendment by RA 9009.
On August 24, 2010, the Court, with a vote of 7-6 granted the motions for reconsideration of the petitioners and reinstated its November 18, 2008 decision. It Court reiterated its November 18, 2008 ruling that the Cityhood Laws violate sec. 10, Art. X of the Constitution which expressly provides that: “no city…shall be created…except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code.” It stressed that while all the criteria for the creation of cities must be embodied exclusively in the Local Government Code, the assailed Cityhood Laws provided an exemption from the increased income requirement for the creation of cities under sec. 450 of the LGC. It further held that: “The unconstitutionality of the Cityhood Laws lies in the fact that Congress provided an exemption contrary to the express language of the Constitution….&lt;br&gt;...Congress exceeded and abused its law-making power, rendering the challenged Cityhood Laws void for being violative of the Constitution.” Finally, it ruled that limiting the exemption only to the 16 municipalities violates the requirement that the classification must apply to all similarly situated.
On February 15, 2011, the Court reversed its own decision for the fourth time, declaring the Cityhood Laws as constitutional.
On April 12, 2011, the Court upheld its ruling with finality that the Cityhood Laws are constitutional. The Court ratiocinated that:“We should not ever lose sight of the fact that the 16 cities covered by the Cityhood Laws not only had conversion bills pending during the 11th Congress, but have also complied with the requirements of the LGC prescribed prior to its amendment by RA No. 9009. Congress undeniably gave these cities all the considerations that justice and fair play demanded. Hence, this Court should do no less by stamping its imprimatur to the clear and unmistakable legislative intent and by duly recognizing the certain collective wisdom of Congress.” Hence, the 16 municipalities were finally converted into component cities.
Aftermath.
The League of Cities of the Philippines finally recognized the sixteen newly converted cities in the country, called as the “League of 16,” as its official members on July 19, 2013.

Lynn and Hunstanton Railway

The Lynn and Hunstanton Railway was a line in Norfolk, England that opened in 1862. The railway was a major factor in developing Hunstanton as a seaside resort and residential community. The company was allied to the West Norfolk Junction Railway which built a line connecting Heacham, south of Hunstanton, to Wells-next-the-Sea that was not a financial success. The companies amalgamated in 1874 to form the Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway, and in 1890 the company was sold to the Great Eastern Railway.
The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, acquired an estate at Sandringham, Norfolk, and Wolferton station was used by the Royal Family and visiting heads of state. Hunstanton developed a thriving holiday trade, and day trip excursions became popular. After 1950 decline set in, and the Wells line closed to passengers in 1952; Hunstanton through trains to and from London ended in 1960 and further decline resulted in closure in 1969.
Promotion and construction.
In 1846 efforts were made to promote Hunstanton as a seaside resort, and by the mid 1850s businesses were keen to attract visitors. The East Anglian Railway subsidised two omnibus services to Hunstanton from Lynn even though the town had a population of fewer than 500 people in 1861.
The northern part of the Lynn and Ely Railway reached King's Lynn, known locally as "Lynn", in 1846. Lynn was 16 miles from Hunstanton and a railway connection was projected. A Parliamentary Bill for the line from Lynn to Hunstanton gained Royal Assent on 1 August 1861. The Lynn and Hunstanton Railway was incorporated, with authorised capital of £60,000. The terminus at New Hunstanton, south of the old centre was where development was possible.
The engineer for the line was John Sutherland Valentine. Finance was raised and the first sod was cut on 13 November 1861. Construction over the relatively flat terrain was completed in ten months within budget.
Opening.
The Board of Trade inspection, required for passenger operation, took place in September 1862, and the line opened for traffic on 3 October 1862. The line was worked by the Great Eastern Railway for 50% of receipts.
The Times reported:
Railway Intelligence... Lynn and Hunstanton: This line was opened for traffic on Friday. The first train started at a little after noon, and conveyed the directors, contractors, and officers of the company, shareholders and others, to the number of about 150. A luncheon was served at the Hunstanton terminus. The line is 15 miles in length from the junction with the East Anglian division of the Great Eastern [Railway] at Gaywood [immediately north of King's Lynn], and its cost amounted altogether to only £80,000. The late Mr. L'Estrange, the proprietor of Hunstanton [Estate], sold the land for about miles of the line at its agricultural value, and took the price in shares...
The Wolverton [Wolferton] station is on the estate of the Prince of Wales (through which the line runs for nearly three miles), and is to be enlarged at the expense and for the accommodation of his Royal Highness. The Hunstanton terminus is near the verge of the cliffs. The line is worked by the Great Eastern Railway Company.
The Sandringham Estate had been purchased in February 1862 for the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII.
The company was successful and a shareholders' meeting in August 1864, reported receipts of £3,500, and the profit after expenses was £1,372. A dividend of 4.5% was declared; by 1865 dividends of 6% were being distributed.
Extending to Wells.
The line's success led businesses to consider whether the North Norfolk coast, eastwards from Hunstanton, could be opened up by a railway. Plans were made for a nominally independent company to build the "West Norfolk Junction Railway", a lightly constructed line feeding into the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, possibly a tramway alongside public roads. A conventional railway was made, and the West Norfolk Junction Railway obtained Royal Assent on 23 June 1864. The line ran from Heacham, the first station south of Hunstanton, to the terminus of the Wells and Fakenham Railway at Wells. It was 18 miles long, and the authorised capital was £75,000. The new company could run trains to Hunstanton and Wells Harbour. The Great Eastern Railway subscribed £30,000 and agreed to work the line for 50% of gross receipts.
Construction was swift and on 8 January 1866 the Prince and Princess of Wales had a semi-private journey several months before the official opening when they travelled to Holkham Hall to visit the Earl of Leicester. The first Board of Trade inspection refused consent to open he line because of shortcomings in the signalling arrangements. After they were rectified, the line opened 17 August 1866.
The line curved sharply north at Wells to use Wells and Fakenham Railway station on the line that had opened in 1857. Another platform was provided for West Norfolk trains. Triangular junctions were planned at Heacham and Wells, but although a west curve formation was made at Wells, no track was laid, and no work was done at Heacham. At Heacham the line faced away from Hunstanton.
There were generally four trains each way between Wells and Heacham, five on Saturdays and market days. In the earliest days passenger trains ran from Lynn to Wells via Hunstanton, passing Heacham twice; but soon most services terminated at Heacham apart from one through working to Hunstanton, which continued northwards after reversal at the junction. Goods services consisted of one return working between King's Lynn and Wells.
The financial crisis in 1866 following the failure of Overend, Gurney and Company's bank and an outbreak of cattle plague in North Norfolk hit the company's income: receipts amounted to £1,355 for the final quarter year of 1866, and no dividend was paid. After the financial success of the Lynn and Hunstanton line, this was a disappointment but the course of the line, which was some distance from the coast and the towns and villages situated on it, militated against its use for goods and passenger purposes.
Amalgamations.
The West Norfolk Railway was allied with the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, and they amalgamated by Act of 8 June 1874, becoming the "Hunstanton and West Norfolk Railway". The Lynn and Hunstanton main line was relatively successful but smaller railways became more fragile in the latter decades of the 19th century, and on 1 July 1890 the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway was sold to the Great Eastern Railway for £160,000 and £5,000 for legal expenses.
Growth from 1890.
In the final years of the century, Hunstanton developed as a holiday resort, not only for holiday stays, but many wealthy business people lived there and travelled to London for business. Golfing stays at Hunstanton became popular and from 1905, a Sunday restaurant car express from London was provided specifically for golfers. As traffic developed, the track was doubled over the southern part of the line and completed between King's Lynn and Wolferton in 1898.
The Royal Family spent a lot of time at Sandringham. Royal trains reversed at King's Lynn where operation by local engines and crews took over. In London they ran to St Pancras station over the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway line. Liverpool Street station was not used because royalty entering the City of London required ceremonial procedures, which were not always expedient. Between 1884 and 1911, 645 royal trains used Wolferton station. Ordinary express passenger trains ran to St Pancras, or conveyed coaches for St Pancras that were slipped at Tottenham Hale or detached there. In the 1930s, Sunday excursions, particularly Sunday schools, and long distance holiday trains became dominant.
West Norfolk trains terminated at Heacham, not usually running through to Hunstanton. There was no runround facility at Wells and after disembarking the passengers, the engine propelled the coaches back up the gradient, and after shunting the engine, the coaches were run down to the station by gravity.
Pullman cars were run on some trains from 1921, but were not popular. From 1929, a day excursion train from London, the Eastern Belle, ran to different seaside destinations from day to day, and typically visited Hunstanton every two weeks on a Tuesday. In 1937 Hunstanton station was enlarged. Its four platforms were lengthened, and accommodation for passenger stock and locomotives was extended. After World War II there was heavy holiday traffic on the line, especially on Sundays, when a one way system was operated: nearly all incoming trains ran in the morning and all outgoing trains in the afternoon and evening. From 1949 a named train, "The Fenman" ran from Liverpool Street to Hunstanton. Heacham also began to develop as a holiday destination.
Decline after 1950.
Poor passenger business on the West Norfolk line resulted in closure to passengers; the last passenger trains ran on Saturday 31 May 1952; but a special Pilgrims' train ran from Kettering to Walsingham on 29 June 1952. Heavy flooding in early 1953 caused the line to be breached at Holkham. The line was not reinstated as it was only open to goods traffic; the stub from Heacham to Burnham was retained for goods traffic, but was closed after 28 December 1964. The 1953 floods engulfed a train on the main line north of Heacham on 31 January 1953; the train was stranded, and the line was not repaired until 23 February 1953.
On the main line, diesel multiple units were introduced from 3 November 1958, and through trains from Liverpool Street to Hunstanton were withdrawn in November 1960, the branch passenger service was operated as a shuttle from King's Lynn. Operation as a basic railway was brought in from 6 June 1966 in an attempt to contain costs.
Hunstanton station was reduced to a single platform from 12 February 1967 and reductions in operating facilities followed when the one engine in steam system was instituted from Wolferton to Hunstanton on 5 March 1967. King's Lynn to Wolferton was reduced to single track on 2 April 1967 when the line was worked as a single section and a no-signalman key token instrument was placed at Hunstanton. Despite this an investment of £25,000 was made that year in the shape of automatic half-barrier level crossing gates. All freight was withdrawn on the line in 1964. The line closed on 5 May 1969.
Restoration efforts.
There has been an ongoing interest in restoring the line. In 1993 the local council expressed interest in protecting the rail formation from development that could block restoration, but early efforts to re-open the line, endorsed by actor Bill Pertwee, were met with hostility by several people who had purchased properties along the former route 
In 2018 a formal campaign to restore the railway was launched. In September 2019 Norfolk County Council began a study into the restoration of the rail link between King's Lynn Lynn and Hunstanton, despite noting the challenges of any reconstruction.
A bid was made in November 2020 for funding from the second round of the Restoring Your Railway fund. It was unsuccessful, with transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris stating that the case needed strengthening, but that "the proposal has potential." In March 2021, a bid was submitted to restore the line from Kings Lynn to Hunstanton as part of the third round of the Restoring Your Railway fund. The King's Lynn Docks announced their support for the restoration of the line, coupled to the restoration of the dock's railway branch.
Despite the implied support of the 1993 protection of the route, the ongoing efforts to restore the line and national level listing of the project, a public house was allowed to be constructed on the formation at Hunstanton and in 2020 plans were released for flats to be built on the former station site.

Operation Gatling

Operation Gatling, which took place on 19 October 1978, was a joint-force operation in Rhodesia launched by the Air Force and the Army; the main forces which contributed were Rhodesian Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. "Gatling" primary target, just north-east of central Lusaka, was the formerly white-owned Westlands Farm, which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name "Freedom Camp". ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior ZIPRA staff also on site.
The Rhodesian operation's other targets were Chikumbi, north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.
Background.
"Operation Gatling" was divided up into three phases when it was being planned by the Rhodesian Security Forces. 
The Operation.
Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to Lusaka Airport tower as "Green Leader", a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against "Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia", and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. The Security Forces used the Rufunsa airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base against the guerrillas' bases.
Aftermath.
During the course of "Operation Gatling" the RSF suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterward claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA cadres, as well as some Cuban instructors. A further 1,348 were wounded and 198 were missing during the course of the three-day operation. In addition to those losses ZIPRA Logistics Officer Mountain Guru was captured by the security forces.
In comparison, only one member of the SAS, trooper Jeff Collett, had been killed. Three other members of the security forces were wounded during "Operation Gatling". Two out of the three men wounded were helicopter pilots Mark Dawson and Roelf Oeloffse, who sustained injuries when their Alouette K-Car was hit by cannon fire, causing it to crash. Dawson suffered injuries to one of his legs and Roelf sustained injuries to his back. In total, the Rhodesians only suffered four casualties and lost one helicopter during the operation.

Olympic quota allocation system

The Olympic quota allocation system is a program designed to limit the number of athletes participating, and prevent a small number of countries from dominating the field of an Olympic event.
Winter Olympics.
Freestyle skiing.
Initially freestyle skiing had two events (moguls and aerials). There were quotas brought in to limit the number of competitors (particularly from the United States and Canada), which are highly competitive in the two events. for the 2010 Olympics the quota system limited the competition for men and women's freestyle skiing (moguls, aerials, and ski-cross) to 180 athletes. Irrespective of international ranking, each country could only have eighteen athletes, and a maximum of ten men or ten women. With the addition of slopestyle and half-pipe in the Sochi Olympics in 2014 the quotas were increased to 282 total athletes, 26 per country, and 14 per gender. This resulted in countries having to limit their participation, despite having eligible athletes. For example, Canada could have sent 33 participants based on international ranking, however they were limited to 26 quota spots. For the 2018 Winter Olympics, the number of athletes participating remained the same, but the number of quota spots increased to a maximum of thirty per country.
Snowboarding.
Snowboarding has a similar quota program to freestyle skiing, with 26 spots available per country. For the 2018 Winter Olympics the only country to fill all of its quota spots was the United States.
Bobsleigh.
For the 2018 Winter Olympics, a maximum of 170 athletes could compete, and a maximum of three teams per event, with the host nation allotted at least one space.

Gortnacargy () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Gortnacargy is bounded on the north by Tirnawannagh townland, on the south by Owengallees townland, on the west by Drumlougher and Teeboy townlands and on the east by Newtown, Templeport and Erraran townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, Bunerky Lough (Irish = Loch Bun Adhairc = The Lake of the Butt of the Horn, it also had an older name Moaneesk (Móin Naosgach = The Bog of the Snipe), Lakefield Lough, Lough Namoyle (Loch na Maoile = The Lake of the Bare Hill), a wood, small streams and dug wells. Gortnacargy is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 155 statute acres.
History.
The townland was inhabited in the Bronze Age as is evidenced by the prehistoric cemetery found there. 
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Gortnacargy was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Gortnekargie", which was named after the townland. 
On 12 November 1590 Queen Elizabeth I of England granted a pardon (No. 5489) to "Edmund M'Gawran of Gortuckargee, gentleman; Phelim O’Doylane of same and Mahon O’Doylan of same, husbandmen" for fighting against the Queen's forces. 
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as "Gortnacargie".
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as "Gorteenshinon".
William Petty's 1685 map depicts the townland as "Gurtinshinon and Gortinshinah".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, King James VI and I granted the "lands of Gortnekargie containing 4 polls, Dowrie containing 1 poll and Corneha containing 1 poll comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to John O’Reily and Connor O’Reily, gentlemen". John O’Reily and Connor O’Reily seem to be the great-great grandsons of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eamón mac Maolmórdha O’Reilly of Kilnacrott, who ruled East Breifne from October 1596–1601. Their genealogy is "Conchobhar &amp; Seaán sons of Cathaoir Óg son of Aodh son of Cathaoir son of Eamón of Kilnacrott son of Maolmórdha son of Seaán son of Cathal". 
By a deed dated 10 May 1611 between "the said Connor McCahir O’Relly of Cargeagh-Callne in County Cavan, gent and John O’Relly of Gortingarge, County Cavan, gent by which they divide between them the 6 poules of land gotten at the last Plantation of the county, viz, the poules of Gortinesimonie, Tirenavan, Dinrewelle, Dune, Dongary and Cornahagh, of which Connor obtained the three first; who is to pay John 10 shillings English yearly in satisfaction of a gallon of land". 
An Inquisition held at Cavan Town on 31 March 1626 found that the said "Cornelius O’Rely, recently of Gortincarge, County Cavan deceased, was seized of said townland of Gortincarge containing 4 polls of land, namely Gortinshemore, Downe and Tyrenewonagh and 2 polls of land in Downe and Corneha. He died on 3 November 1625. His daughter and heir Mor O’Rely was then 15 years old and married".
The aforesaid O'Reilly lands in Gortnacargy were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Gurteensheemon" with the proprietor being "William Brampson".
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were three taxpayers in the townland- "William Bramston of Gartnecarga, John Bramston of the same, John Petfielde of the same."
A grant dated 30 January 1668 was made from King Charles II of England to William Bramston for the "46 acres and 2 roods in Gortmcshinan at an annual rent of seventeen shillings". A grant dated 9 September 1669 was made from King Charles II of England to Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, for "31 acres and 2 roods acres in the west part of Gortinshinon at an annual rent of eight shillings and fourpence".
A deed dated 13 Nov 1738 includes: "the thirds of Gottnashangan". 
The Reverend Veaitch Betty of Lakefield, Templeport by his will dated 16 July 1783 (Born 1709. Died August 1785. Probate granted July 1796) stated- "To be buried in the vault I made at Temple Piert.

House of Councillors national district

The was a 50-member electoral district for the House of Councillors, the upper house of the National Diet of Japan, from 1947 to 1980. It consisted of the whole country. In staggered elections, it elected 100 of the 250 members of the House of Councillors by single non-transferable vote (SNTV). In an SNTV/SNTV parallel system, the other 150 members were also elected by SNTV, but in more decisive, lower-magnitude districts contiguous with the 47 prefectures, several of them single-member districts where SNTV is equivalent to first-past-the-post.
In the 1983 regular election, the national district was replaced with the proportional district which is equally nationwide, but is often just called proportional district "(hirei-ku)" to avoid ambiguity. It elects the same number of members, but now in a proportional system from party lists. By 1986, the directly elected members from the national district were replaced by proportional party list members in both classes of the House of Councillors.
Highest and lowest-ranking winners.
In the 1968 election, writer Shintarō Ishihara garnered more than 3 million votes, the all-time record. He stood as candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party; but unlike the current proportional preference system, where every preference vote for a candidate in the proportional district also counts towards the party total in the overall allocation of the proportional seats, high personal vote totals in the national district did not immediately benefit the party beyond the prestige of taking the top spot.
On the other end of the winner list, the number of votes necessary to obtain a seat was around 150,000 in the immediate postwar years. Under the 1955 party system, more than 250,000 votes were needed to win a seat. By the 1970s when the baby boomers had entered the electorate, it took more than half a million votes for a candidate to be elected.
Note: In many regular election years, including the 1st regular election of 1947 when all members had to be elected at once, the election was combined with a by-election to the class not up into one SNTV election. The top 50 members would always be elected for the full six year-term. If there were x vacancies in the other class, the 51st to (50+x)th ranking candidates would be elected to fill the vacant seats for the remaining 3-year term.

1892 United States presidential election in North Dakota

The 1892 United States presidential election in North Dakota took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. Voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
North Dakota participated in its first presidential election, having been admitted as the 39th state on November 2, 1889. The state was won by the Populist nominees, James B. Weaver of Iowa and his running mate James G. Field of Virginia. However, the state Democratic Party also endorsed the Weaver/Field ticket in exchange for the Populists supporting Democratic candidates for local offices, creating a fusion ticket. Weaver and Field defeated the Republican nominees, incumbent President Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and his running mate Whitelaw Reid of New York. Two electors from the Democratic-Populist Fusion ticket won and one Republican Elector won on a technicality during counting. This created a split delegation of electors: one for Weaver, one for Harrison, and one for national Democratic candidate Grover Cleveland, who was not separately on the ballot. This is the only time in a US presidential election that a state has equally distributed its electoral votes between three candidates.

Theriological School

Theriological School – a professional and educational network that unites specialists in mammalogy of Ukraine and adjacent countries, first of all Poland, Belarus and, from time to time, Estonia, Russia and Romania. Theriological school as a community exists both as a network of professionals and as an annual meeting.
History.
Theriological School was started as one of the sections of Ukrainian theriological society (UTS) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NAS) in Autumn 1993 (24 November 1993) by a joint decision of three institutions – Ukrainian Theriological Society, Ministry of Nature Conservation and the Commission on the Reserves of NAS of Ukraine. Since its foundation in 1993 and until now Therioschool became one of the main activity of UTS. Igor Zagorodniuk, deputy head of the UTS, is one of the initiators of the creation and a head of Theriological school (together with O. Fedorchenko, O. Kiselyuk and V. Pokinchereda).
The first newsletter (later: a regular newsletter and since 2000 – a bulletin “Novitates Theriologicae”) was distributed on 24 November 1993. The first (and in future: annual) conference (a school-seminar) was organized on 3 October 1994 at Carpathian Biosphere Reserve. The first issue of a journal "Proceedings of the Theriological School" was published in 1998 and presented during the V Theriological school on biological station of National University of Kharkiv. A website of Ukrainian Theriological Society was started in spring 2003 (25 May 2003).
All activities of Theriological school are maintained entirely on the enthusiasm of its Board and its regular participants. The Board of the school organizes each next seminar in another place – usually, in one of the nature or biosphere reserves or at biological stations of one of the universities, and much less often in cities on the base of universities, institutes or museums of the natural history (the XII-th Terioschool was held in Luhansk, the XIII-th – at Kamianets-Podilskyi and the XXIV – in Odessa).
Objectives.
The concept of Theriological school was formulated in the journal "Nature Reserves in Ukraine" (1999) and these ideas were developed during all 24 schools. The key tasks of the society are:
Forms and scheme of work.
Therioschool exists in two main forms – as a network of professionals and the annual seminar (workshop). The network includes more than 200 respondents from Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Estonia, Moldova, Romania, Hungary (descending). The seminar is usually gathering about 30–70 participants and lasts on average 5 days.
The school follows a uniform scheme which is described in details at the website of society . The main features of Theriological school are:
Journal.
The Journal of the Theriological School – "Proceedings of the Theriological School" (later – PTS) is registered in International Center for Registration of Scientific Publications with ISSN 2312-2749 (print) and ISSN 2074-2274 (online). In 2018 journal changes its title to "Theriologia Ukrainica".
The journal PTS was approved by Higher Attestation Commission of Ukraine (known as "VAK") in 2016 as a professional publication which can accept and publish the results of investigations in a framework of dissertation works. All articles submitted to PTS go through three reviews – primary review from the editorial board and two other reviews – from independent experts (peer review).
Since 1998, 15 volumes of the journal PTS were published (on average 170–180 pages in each volume). Also, each volume contains on average 18–22 articles.
The information about each volume is posted on Internet (the website of Theriological School) according to the requirements of the Web of Science: each volume and each article has its own homepage with a detailed English summary (over 1000 characters). Each article contains an abstract, key words, legends to the figures and tables, bibliography (everything is dubbed in English). Each volume has at least 4–7 articles written in English (this is from 1/4 to 1/3 part of the whole journal).
Page of the PTS in website of the National Museum of Natural History of Ukraine: »&gt;
On 20 October 2020, according to log profile on Google Scholar, there are 1623 citations of 308 articles of the PTS. h-index is = 16, the index i10 (the number of articles cited at least 10 times) is 40. These results are quite high for Ukrainian journals.

Anthony Gianelly

Anthony Gianelly (1936–2009) was an American orthodontist. He developed the bi-dimensional technique, which is widely used in various private practices of orthodontics and has been the subject of numerous publications over the years.
Gianelly served as the Chair of the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics at Boston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine.
Life.
Gianelly was born in Boston in 1936, and was the younger of two brothers. He attended Harvard College and played in the Harvard Crimson football team as a leading fullback and a linebacker in the varsity football team during the 1954–1956 season. He also was part of Harvard rugby and the Harvard track and field team.
He received his dental degree from Harvard School of Dental Medicine in 1961 and received his orthodontics degree in 1963. He became a research fellow in Orthodontics at Harvard in 1963, and was appointed Associate Professor of Orthodontics at Boston University in 1967. He obtained his PhD degree in biology and biochemistry from Boston University in 1967 and received his MD degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 1974. While obtaining his PhD degree, he also became a full-time professor at Boston University School of Dental Medicine, a position he held until his death.
He died of a heart attack at the age of 72 on May 28 in 2009. Gianelly is survived by his wife, two children, and two grandchildren.
Orthodontics.
Gianelly developed the bidimensional technique, in which two orthodontic different bracket slots are used in the mouth. An 0.018 slot is used on the central and lateral incisors and an 0.022 slot is used on the canines, premolars and molars. A wire such as 18x25 can allow a tight fit in the anterior brackets with the 0.018 slot and a loose fit in the posterior teeth with a 0.022 slot. Posteriorly, this allows less friction to be involved, which leads to a better sliding mechanism. There is about 0.004in slot between the posterior brackets and wire.
Gianelly published over 90 scientific articles in his career, and co-authored textbooks including "Biologic Basis of Orthodontics" (1971), "Ortodonzia, Concetti Practici" (1985), and "Bidimensional Technique: Theory and Practice" (2000).

2018 Russian Air Force Antonov An-26 crash

On 6 March 2018 an Antonov An-26 transport aircraft crashed on approach to Khmeimim air base in Syria, killing all 39 people on board. All of them were servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces, including Major-General Vladimir Yeremeyev.
Aircraft.
The accident aircraft was an Antonov An-26, registration RF-92955, msn 10107. It had first flown in 1980. This accident is the fifteenth An-26 fatal crash in this decade with a total of 159 deaths, none of these flights were scheduled passenger airline operations.
Crash.
At about 14:00 local time (12:00 UTC) the Russian Antonov An-26 went down about from the runway. The preliminary cause was attributed to technical malfunction. Based on reports from the location, the Russian Ministry of Defense ruled out the possibility that it was shot down. The Investigative Committee of Russia and the Russian Military Prosecutor's Office opened criminal cases concerning the crash.
The Islamic militant group Jaysh al-Islam later claimed the responsibility for the crash; according to "Ad-Diyar", five militants shot at the aircraft with heavy machine guns when it was 100 m from the ground. It was suggested that the claim might be false, as the group has made opportunistic claims in the past, as have some other groups.
Cause.
The aircraft flew on final approach with a tail wind and was caught by windshear on final. It banked, lost height and crashed some 500 metres before the runway threshold.

1892 United States presidential election in Colorado

The 1892 United States presidential election in Colorado took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. Colorado voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
In its early days as a state, Colorado had like the Plains States to its east been solidly Republican, with that party continuously controlling the legislature and holding the governorship for five of seven terms, despite widespread criticism of the national party for its monetary policy. Because Colorado was the leading silver-producing state in the nation, the policies of the federal government since President Hayes were deeply unpopular with both silver miners and mineowners. Crises emerging in Colorado’s agricultural sector from low wheat prices and a severe drought in 1888 and 1889, combined with the state’s underdevelopment to produce resentment of the Northeast, where the Republican Party’s power base was located.
The Populist Party’s platform called for replacing the gold standard with the free coinage of silver at a 16:1 ratio with gold. This meant that outside the Hispanic south-central counties and some parts of the eastern High Plains, support for the Populist movement was extremely strong in the state, even among many conservatives who opposed the Populists’ economic philosophy but were concerned primarily about the silver issue. In order to achieve success, the newly-formed Populist Party would fuse with the minority Democratic Party, although a proposed slate of electors pledged to national Democratic nominees Grover Cleveland and Adlai Stevenson I was not withdrawn with the instruction to support the Populist nominee James B. Weaver until the last week before the poll, after a long struggle within the state Democratic Party.
Vote.
Polls on election day said Weaver was two-to-one on to carry Colorado, and in the end Weaver and running mate James G. Field carried the state by 15.94 points over the Republican nominees, incumbent President Benjamin Harrison of Indiana and his running mate Whitelaw Reid of New York. Weaver dominated most of the state, especially the high mountains and West Slope.
Colorado was one of a handful of states, five in total, that did not feature former and future President Grover Cleveland on their ballots.

Isa Soares

Isa Soares (born 1953) is a Brazilian-born Argentine dancer and activist involved in creating awareness of the African traditions of Argentina and fighting racism against Afro-Argentine peoples. She was one of the pioneers in developing African dance interpretation and instruction in Argentina.
Early life.
María Isabel Soares Sousa was born in 1953 in Maragogipe, of the Brazilian state of Bahia to Afro-Brazilian parents Iraildes Sousa Gomes and Fernando Bispo Soares. Her father had degrees in both biochemistry and music, and her mother was a dressmaker and tobacconist. After completing her primary and secondary education, Soares attended the Federal Institute of Bahia in Salvador, earning her teaching credentials in 1972. She moved to São Paulo and had a son, while continuing her education at the University of São Paulo. The focus of her studies was on the socio-cultural and historic development of dance and the impact of the slave trade upon cultural practices.
Career.
While continuing her studies, Soares worked as a primary school teacher. She took dance lessons with Wilson Silva, who taught her the basic techniques of African dance and how those spread into the Americas through "candombe" in Uruguay, "samba" from Brazil and tap dancing in the United States. In 1982, she married and as was expected of women in her generation, followed her husband to Argentina, giving up her career in 1983. The couple settled in Bahía Blanca and Soares returned to her studies through the National Technical Education Council (), earning her technical instructor's certification. As there were few prospects for a black woman in the arts to earn a living in Bahía Blanca, she left the area in 1985 and moved to Buenos Aires. Between 1985 and 1987, Soares studied and worked as a dance instructor on a scholarship in the dance school of Aida Prestifilippo, the principal dancer of the Teatro Colón. In addition to providing the scholarship Prestifilippo helped introduce Soares to the dance circuit in Buenos Aires, allowing her to perform at various local venues.
The era was one of cultural expansion, following the suppression of individual expression throughout the period of National Reorganization Process from 1973-1983. From the end of the dictatorship, Soares gave lessons in African dance at a small salon on Corrientes Street in Buenos Aires and organized performances and events to expand the knowledge of black culture in Argentina. Beginning in 1987, she worked as a dance instructor of a course "Dance of Orixás" ( for the Centro Cultural Rector Ricardo Rojas, an organization affiliated with the University of Buenos Aires. Between 1990 and 2006, Soares was the coordinator for African dance at the Centro and began traveling to places like Rosario, Santa Fe in the Santa Fe Province to teach and back to Brazil for students to train in Bahia. She also hosted annual summer courses on dances with African roots through the Municipal Institute of Education for Art in the Municipality of Avellaneda. Forming an association with activists, artists and intellectuals, Soares actively worked to fight racial discrimination and bring back an awareness of the roots of black culture in Argentina.
At the end of 2006, Soares left the Center, though she continued with private dance instruction and taught a seminar which consolidated Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Cuban dance styles. In 2007, she began teaching courses at the Instituto Universitario Nacional del Arte as well as directing an independent project, known as the Alábase Project, which focuses on the study and performance of the methodology of the Yoruban dance based upon the tradition of "xiré". She is considered one of the pioneering dancers who brought African cultural expression back to Argentina after the close of the dictatorship.

1977 UK Athletics Championships

The 1977 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Cwmbran Stadium, Cwmbran.
It was the first edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1977 AAA Championships.
Ainsley Bennett and Sonia Lannaman won sprint doubles in the 100 metres and 200 metres in the men's and women's side, respectively. Sharon Colyear took the women's titles in 100 metres hurdles and long jump. Other athletes who performed well in multiple events were Andrea Lynch (double sprint runner-up), Allan Wells (100 m runner-up and 200 m third-placer), and Tessa Sanderson who won the javelin throw as well as placing top three in the 400 metres hurdles.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1977 European Cup. Distance runners Steve Ovett and Nick Rose won both the UK event and the European Cup title. Sanderson, Lannaman, Bennett were minor medallists there, as were women's 400 metres champion Donna Hartley and men's long jump runner-up Roy Mitchell.

Gulliford Farm

Gulliford Farm is a Grade-II listed farmhouse in East Devon, between Exmouth and Topsham. It is situated in the village of Exton, in the parish of Woodbury. The main residential building dates to the 16th Century with later Georgian and Victorian additions.
History.
First mention of Gulliford Farm comes as a small dwelling in one of many small hamlets which sprung up in the area around 1300., its name deriving from "Geldforde" or "Geldfeld", a reference to the harvests from the lands surrounding the waterways of East Devon.
The buildings which then existed were part of the Nutwell Estate, owned by the Dynham (1311-1501) and Prideaux (1520-1649) families, respectively. Through them the farm was rented and used by tenant farmers, with the largest farm remaining as Nutwell Castle itself.
In 1575, after centuries on inadequate maintenance, the 14th Century buildings were torn down, and a new, large home farm and hunting lodge was built by Sir Francis Drake, 2nd Bart. It is through the second Baronet that the Drake family, mainly Sir Francis Henry Drake, 5th Baronet, would eventually possess Gulliford.
In 1649, Amias Prideaux sold Gulliford, as a part of the lands of Nutwell Castle, to Sir Henry Ford, whose trustees once again sold the estate following his death. At this point Sir Henry Pollexfen bought the estate, and Gulliford soon after entered the ownership of the Drake Family. Toward the end of the 18th Century, Gulliford passed to Francis Augustus Eliott, 2nd Baron Heathfield, who was the son of the Governor of Gibraltar during the American Revolutionary Wars, George Augustus Elliot, 1st Baron Heathfield.
It was the 2nd Baron Heathfield that from 1780-1799 destroyed all but the chapel of the original Nutwell, and rebuilt the house, whilst briefly living at Gulliford. It was at this time that the baron extended Gulliford to include the extensive brick barns and rooms in the two courtyards. These were designed to hold 'up to 30- horses for plough-sharing' and accommodation for staff and visitors. The farmhouse is a Grade II listed building.
In 1979, June Hallett - the wife of the then-owner of the farm, uncovered plaster of paris frescoes on the inner walls of a fireplace in the house. The images were consequentially restored, and are believed to be the earliest known depictions of Californian Poppies. The frescoes are estimated to have been made between 1580-1585, immediately following Sir Francis Drake's return from his circumnavigation of the globe.

<doc id="56766940" url="?curid=56766940" title="Diophon">
Diophon

Diophon (1921 – after 1935) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was probably the best two-year-old colt of his generation in England in 1923 when he won four of his five races including the July Stakes Lavant Stakes and Middle Park Stakes. In the following spring he gave his owner Aga Khan III the first of his many classic wins when he took the 2000 Guineas. He failed to win again that year but returned to take three valuable prizes in 1925. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Diophon was a "handsome" chestnut horse bred in England by Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon. As a yearling he was put up for auction at Doncaster and bought for 4000 guineas by George Lambton on behalf of the Aga Khan. The colt was sent into training with Dick Dawson at Whatcombe, near Lambourn in Berkshire.
He was from the first crop of foals sired by the 1919 Derby winner Grand Parade, the rest of whose stud career was disappointing. Diophon's dam Donetta was a durable racemare who competed until the age before becoming a very successful broodmare, with her other foals including Diadem, Dionysos (Irish St Leger) and Diadumenos (Jubilee Handicap).
Racing career.
1923: two-year-old season.
Diophon made a successful racecourse debut in the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was ridden George Hulme and won at odds of 7/1 from Obliterate. At the next Newmarket meeting he was allowed to walk over in the Chestefield takes when no horses appeared to oppose him and then took the Lavant Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Despite conceding weight to his seven opponents, Diophon started favourite for the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket in early October but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten a head into second place by the previously unraced Woodend.
Two weeks later, in "dismal weather conditions", Diophon started 2/1 favourite in an eleven-runner field for the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at the same track. He won by one and a half lengths from Plack, a filly who went on to win the 1000 Guineas, with Knight of the Garter third and Woodend unplaced.
Although Diophon was considered a leading contender for the following year's British Classic Races he was regarded as being inferior to his female stablemate Mumtaz Mahal.
1924: three-year-old season.
On 7 May, with Hulme in the saddle, Diophon started at odds of 11/2 in a twenty-runner field for the 116th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. In a very close finish, which saw the leaders racing up opposite sides of the wide Newmarket track, he was adjudged to have won by a head from Bright Knight with Green Fire a neck away in third. The photo-finish camera was not used in England at that time and most of the spectators disagreed with the judge's decision, believing that Bright Knight had crossed the line in front. The runner-up's jockey, Frank Bullock, stated that he was certain that he had won the race by at least a length. Diophon's victory provided a first classic success for both his owner and jockey.
The 1924 Derby Stakes was run in exceptionally wet and testing conditions at Epsom Racecourse on 4 June. Despite doubts about his ability to cope with the heavy ground, Diophon was strongly fancied, but was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Sansovino who won easily. At Royal Ascot he ran in the Ribblesdale Stakes (then a race open to both colts and fillies) and finished second to Live Wire. In the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood in August Diophon initially refused to go down to the start and had to be led by a mounted policeman. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten by Burslem, leading to speculation that he was not "in love with racing".
1925: four-year-old season.
On 4 May 1925 Diophon contested the Lingfield Park Spring Stakes and finished second, beaten a head by Sansovino, with the Argentinian colt El Cacique three lengths back in third. At Newbury Racecourse on 10 June he was assigned a weight of 140 pounds for the Royal Plate and from Glommen and Invershin despite struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight. It was said by the "Sporting Life" that "no horse could have battled more heartily" and that the impression that he sometimes gave less than his best effort was created by the colt's oddly-set ears. He then finished second to Caravel in the Rous Memorial Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot, beaten a head in a "great finish". In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park on 17 July he came home third behind Polyphontes and Zambo in a thirteen-runner field. In the same month he won the £2595 Atlantic Cup at Liverpool. In August Diophon added an "easy" win in the Great Midland Breeders' Plate over ten furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Diophon an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Diophon was retired from racing at the end of his four-year-old season to become a breeding stallion. The best of his offspring were Diolite, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1930 and the Irish Oaks winner Theresina. His overall record was disappointing and he was sold and exported to Greece.

Testimonies (novel)

Testimonies is a 1952 novel, set in North Wales, by the English author Patrick O'Brian. It was first published in the UK under the title Three Bear Witness, and in the US as "Testimonies".
Plot.
The story is constructed from the testimonies that three witnesses give to an unnamed divine inquisitor: Joseph Aubrey Pugh, an Oxford don; Bronwen Vaughan, the woman he comes to love; and Mr Lloyd, a schoolmaster.
Pugh says that he had been expecting the visitation, and that he will do his best to set down in writing what had taken place. According to his testimony, having become exhausted and demoralised by his academic life in Oxford, Pugh decides to rent a small cottage in North Wales for an extended break, intending to spend his time walking in the hills and reading. He throws himself into his new life, becoming friends with Emyr, son of the elderly owners of the neighbouring farm of Gelli, Mr and Mrs Vaughan. He helps out at Gelli to the best of his ability, though he disapproves of Emyr using strychnine to poison the foxes that threaten the farm’s lambs. Gradually Pugh finds himself falling in love with Emyr’s wife, Bronwen. On receiving an unexpected bequest, he abandons his academic career and takes the cottage as his permanent home.
The schoolmaster, Mr Lloyd, tells the inquisitor that Bronwen had been brought up in a different valley and that she was ‘not our sort’. After marrying and coming to live at Gelli with Emyr and his parents she had been considered ‘proud’ and was unpopular with the local women.
Bronwen testifies that her marriage was initially good, and they had a child, but that she became scared of Emyr after he was violent toward her one night. As her hatred of Emyr became increasingly evident, his mother turned against her and daily life at Gelli became very difficult.
Pugh falls ill and moves to Gelli to recuperate. There he spends hours talking to Bronwen, and his love for her deepens. Mr Lloyd’s cousin, a famous preacher by the name of Pritchard Ellis, comes to stay. He is revered by the local people for the power of his public oratory, but in private he is a hypocrite and sexual voyeur. After sexually touching Bronwen when they are alone, and being repulsed, he retaliates by spreading false rumours that Pugh and Bronwen are committing adultery. He preaches a powerful two-hour sermon in chapel denouncing Bronwen and Pugh's ‘wickedness’, though without mentioning them by name, which results in their being ostracised by the community.
One night Emyr is sexually violent to Bronwen again, and she tells the inquisitor that her husband nearly killed her. Pugh sees her the next day and realises what Emyr has done. He departs for a long and nightmarish walk through the mountains, contemplating suicide. Seriously hurt, Bronwen is put to bed and a doctor is called. Old Mrs Vaughan comes in with some medicine and Bronwen, after taking a sip, realises immediately that it is laced with strychnine. She drinks it and dies. Pugh returns, utterly exhausted, and lies unconscious before being awakened to learn of Bronwen’s fate.
Background.
The novel's setting is closely based on Cwm Croesor in North Wales, where O'Brian and his wife had rented a small cottage in 1946 as an escape from post-war London. The character of Pugh is semi-autobiographical, and his intended monograph "The Bestiary Before Isidore of Seville" was a subject that O'Brian later said he had himself been working on before the war. According to his step-son and biographer Nikolai Tolstoy, the fiction provided "the flimsiest of veils for [the author's] deepest personal concerns". He notes that Pugh - like O'Brian himself - "sets himself up as a gentleman and adopts a name more appropriate to his improved status, concerning which he resents being questioned".
Publication.
The novel was first published in 1952, the UK version appearing under the title "Three Bear Witness" as O'Brian's UK publishers Secker &amp; Warburg were of the view that his preferred title "Testimonies" would be difficult to sell. In the US it was published by Harcourt, Brace as "Testimonies". Unaware that O'Brian had changed his name in 1945 from Richard Patrick Russ, many reviewers assumed the novel to be the author's first.
In 1994 the UK version was renamed "Testimonies" and re-published by HarperCollins with new cover art by Geoff Hunt, the cover-artist for the re-issued volumes of the Aubrey–Maturin series. Hunt illustrates a cottage almost identical with the real-life cottage in Cwm Croesor that O'Brian and his wife had rented in 1946. In the US the novel was reissued in 1993 by Norton.
Literary significance and criticism.
The first English reviews were not encouraging. On 10 May 1952, an unnamed Times reviewer called the book "a slight and technically immature piece of work, loose-jointed and clumsy in construction to the point of amateurishness", though conceding that the book "leaves an impression of genuine talent". On 16 May the Times Literary Supplement called it "a quiet little story of much merit", while likewise considering its central literary device to be 'clumsy'.
The US reviews were entirely different. In an influential omnibus review in "Partisan Review", Delmore Schwartz praised the book at the expense of John Steinbeck, Evelyn Waugh, Angus Wilson and Ernest Hemingway. Schwartz said "To read a first novel by an unknown author which, sentence by sentence and page by page makes one say: he can't keep going at this pace, the intensity is bound to break down, the perfection of tone can't be maintained - is to rejoice in an experience of pleasure and astonishment ... [It] makes one think of a great ballad or a Biblical story ... The reader, drawn forward by lyric eloquence and the story's fascination, discovers in the end that he has encountered in a new way the sphinx and the riddle of existence itself". He concluded by comparing O'Brian's prose to the lyrics of the great Irish poet W. B. Yeats. In later editions of the book, part of Schwartz's review was reprinted as a preface.
The "New York Herald Tribune" Book Review called it "one of the finest books to come along for some time".", while Saturday Review" said that "Mr. O'Brian has made a story that moves to its end with the rightness and inevitability we think of as Greek". 
"The New York Times Book Review" dubbed the book "A rare and beautiful novel, deceptively modest in form, never faltering in the unobtrusive skill of its poetry and dramatic dimensions". The character of Bronwen was singled out for particular praise as "an altogether touching and marvelous woman, so persuasively and sympathetically portrayed that she deserves a place among great heroines - for all the differences of setting and scale, [she] has some of the stature of an Anna Karenina". The reviewer noted the author’s expert pacing of the story, his extraordinary gift for the visual scene, and his brilliant ear for the subtle counterpoint of sound in speech.
On the book's first publication, Kirkus Reviews considered the novel to be of "unassuming proportion and immaculate design". Reviewing the 1993 US re-issue, the magazine noted a "chaste and disciplined prose [that lends] purity to a quiet, tragic idyll for the discriminating reader".
Adaptations.
A dramatised adaptation of the book by Colin Haydn Evans was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2002. The audio was recorded by a listener and is available on the Internet Archive.
Relationship with later works.
The surnames Aubrey and Maturin - later to be used for the protagonists of O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series of nautical historical novels - both appear in "Testimonies".

<doc id="56767084" url="?curid=56767084" title="Daryll Forde">
Daryll Forde

Cyril Daryll Forde FRAI (16 March 1902 – 3 May 1973) was a British anthropologist and Africanist.
Education and early career.
Forde was born in Tottenham on 16 March 1902, the son of John Percival Daniel Forde, a reverend and schoolmaster, and Caroline Pearce Pittman. He attended the local county school in Tottenham, then went on to read geography at University College London (UCL).
At that time there was no department of anthropology at UCL; the geography department had interests in ethnography and archaeology, but for the most part it was the domain of Grafton Elliot Smith, a professor of anatomy and noted proponent of hyperdiffusionism. Forde studied under Smith and, upon completing his bachelor's degree in 1924, he was appointed a lecturer in the department of anatomy. His earliest work was influenced by Smith's belief that all of human civilisation originated in ancient Egypt. In his first book, "Ancient Mariners" (1928), Forde traced the origins of shipbuilding and maritime navigation to Egypt, whence he supposed it was carried around the world in ancient voyages:
Smith and Forde also collaborated on the excavation of a Bronze Age tumulus near Dunstable. The main focus of his research in the anatomy department, however, was the megalithic cultures of prehistoric western Europe. In this he was influenced by the culture historical theories of V. Gordon Childe, who would become a lifelong friend and collaborator. Childe tempered Forde's enthusiasm for hyperdiffusionism, but Forde still advanced the idea that European megaliths were a "degenerated" imitation of monuments in the Near East. This theory remained influential in archaeology for many years.
Forde's archaeological work won him the Society of Antiquaries' prestigious Franks Studentship in 1924, and in 1928 he was awarded a doctorate in prehistoric archaeology.
Fellowship at Berkeley (1928–1930).
After receiving his doctorate, Forde won a Commonwealth Fellowship to work with the American anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie at the University of California, Berkeley. He had been introduced to Lowie during the latter's visit to London in 1924. Both Kroeber and Lowie were students of Franz Boas, making Berkeley an influential early centre of what became known as Boasian anthropology. The intellectual climate there—very different to anthropology in Britain—had a profound effect on Forde's scholarship. He would later refer to it as his "transatlantic noviciate".
Both Kroeber and Lowie also had backgrounds in archaeology, but were committed to the Boasian four field approach and the holistic study of humanity. They therefore encouraged Forde to conduct ethnographic fieldwork with local Native American tribes. He worked with the Yuma of the lower Colorado river valley and the Hopi of northern Arizona, leading to his most well-known work, "Habitat, Economy and Society: a Geographical Introduction to Ethnology" (1934). At Berkeley, he was trained in ecological anthropology and brought this tradition with him back to the UK.
Chair at Aberystwyth University (University College of Wales, Aberystwyth) 1930-1945.
In 1930, when still only 28 years old, Daryll Forde was appointed Gregynog Professor of Geography and Anthropology at the University of Wales at Aberystwyth. It was here, aged 31, that he commenced a 5 year excavation programme on the local Iron Age hillfort of Pen Dinas between 1933-37, answering many earlier calls made during the 1920s for the excavation and dating of a local hillfort. Contemporary photographs of the excavation show the young Daryll Forde on site, well-dressed among the workmen and clearly enjoying directing one of the largest hillfort excavations in southern Britain at that time. It was during his early years at Aberystwyth in 1934 that he also published his influential text book 'Habitat, Economy and Society'. 
Later career.
From 1945 he worked at University College London, and built a school of American-style cultural anthropology there, distinct from the social anthropology of British-trained contemporaries such as Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Meyer Fortes and E. E. Evans-Pritchard.
From 1935 he worked in Nigeria with the Yakö people. His work in Africa resulted in several volumes of "African Worlds: Studies in the Cosmological Ideas and Social Values of African Peoples" (1954). From 1945 to 1973 he was the director of the International African Institute.
UCL's department of anthropology has an annual lecture series and a seminar room named in his honour.

Italian idealism

Italian idealism, born from interest in the German one and particularly in Hegelian doctrine, developed in Italy starting from the spiritualism of the nineteenth-century Risorgimento tradition, and culminated in the first half of the twentieth century in its two greatest exponents: Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile.
Risorgimento Hegelianism.
In the age of Romanticism, Italian patriots' philosophical circles, especially in Naples, found in Hegelian idealism the way to give a spiritual and cultural imprint to the historical path towards national unification.
The interest in the Hegelian doctrine in Italy spread especially for the works of Augusto Vera (1813–1885) and Bertrando Spaventa (1817–1883), without omitting also the importance of the studies on Hegel "Aesthetic" by Francesco De Sanctis (1817–1883), author of the "Storia della letteratura italiana".
De Sanctis's concept of art and of literary history, inspired by Hegel, will stimulate the genesis of Crocian idealism.
Augusto Vera, author of writings and commentaries about Hegel, was a famous philosopher in Europe, who interpreted the Hegelian Absolute in a religious and transcendent sense.
An opposite interpretation was formulated by Bertrand Spaventa, for whom the Spirit was immanent in the history of philosophy.
Reconstructing the development of Italian philosophy, Spaventa argued that Italian Renaissance thought of Bruno and Campanella had been at the origin of modern philosophy, but had stopped due to the Counter-Reformation. Its task now was to catch up with European philosophy, linking up with Vico's mind philosophy, which along with those of Galluppi, Rosmini, and Gioberti, had anticipated themes of Kantism and German idealism.
Spaventa reformulated the Hegelian dialectic, reinterpreting it from the perspective of Kantian and Fichtian conscientialism or subjectivism.
He considered the act of thinking prevalent with respect to the phases of objectification and synthesis. That is, he supported the need to «mentalise» Hegel, because the Mind is the protagonist of every original production.
The synthesis of the actual thinking of the Spirit was then placed by Spaventa, as the only reality, not only after the hegelian moments of Idea and of Nature, but so as to permeate them also from the beginning.
Gentile and Croce.
After a parenthesis characterized by positivism, in 1913 Giovanni Gentile (1875–1944) with the publication of "The reform of Hegelian dialectics" resumed Spaventa's interpretation of the Hegelian Idea, seeing in Hegelian Spirit the category of becoming as coinciding with the pure act of thought in which the whole reality of nature, history and spirit was transfused.
Every thing exists only in the mental act of thinking it: there are no single empirical entities separated from the trascendental consciousness; even the past lives only in the actual, present moment of memory. To Gentile, who considered himself the "philosopher of Fascism", actual idealism was the sole remedy to philosophically preserving free agency, by making the act of thinking self-creative and, therefore, without any contingency and not in the potency of any other fact.
Gentile reproached Hegel for having built his dialectic with elements proper to "thought", that is to say that of determined thought and of the sciences. For Gentile, instead, only in "thinking in action" is dialectical self-consciousness that includes everything.
Gentile made a pivotal distinction to factors concerning Idealism's own criteria for reality, which have stood since Berkeley's adage «"esse est percipi"» by distinguishing between the concrete real «act of thinking» ("pensiero pensante"), and the abstract «static thought» ("pensiero pensato").
To his actual vision was opposed since 1913 Benedetto Croce (1866–1952, cousin of Bertrando Spaventa) who in his "Essay on Hegel" interpreted Hegelian thought as immanentist historicism: he also understood the Hegelian dialectic of the opposites in a different way, integrating it with that of the «distincts». According to Croce, in fact, the life of the Spirit also consists of autonomous moments that are not opposed, but rather distinct, that is: 
Referring to Giambattista Vico, Croce identified philosophy with history, understood not as a capricious sequence of events, but the implementation of Reason, in the light of which it becomes possible the historical understanding of the genesis of facts, and their simultaneous justification with her own unfolding.
Historian's task is therefore to overcome every form of emotionality towards the studied matter, and to present it in form of knowledge, without referring to good or evil.
After having characterized Italian philosophical culture for over forty years, after the second world war the neo-idealism entered a crisis, replaced by existentialism, neo-positivism, phenomenology and marxism.

Members and contributors have included Don Amero, William Prince, Pamela Davis, Neewa Mason, Marty Chapman, Atik Mason, Gerry Atwell, Jamie Carrasco, Jay Bodner, Jeremy Koz, Rena Semenko, Steve Broadhurst, Rich Reid and Shannon McKenney.
History.
Indian City formed in 2012, and the band's debut album "Supernation" was released in August of that year, accompanied by a concert in Winnipeg. "Supernation" won Best Pop Album, and Amero won Male Entertainer of the Year for both his work with Indian City and his solo album "Heart on My Sleeve", at that year's Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. They followed up with a second album, "Colors", in 2013.
In 2015 Indian City released a single, "One Day", which reaches out to those having thoughts of suicide.
"Here &amp; Now", their third album, was released on February 15, 2017. Three of the songs from the album won the Indian Summer Music Awards in 2017: "Tree of Life" as Best Country; "Seasons" as Best Pop; and "Here &amp; Now" as Best Rock. The album was nominated for the 2018 Indigenous Music Album of the Year for the Juno Awards.
One of the songs on this album, "Through the Flood", features Don Amero and directly addresses the issues of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. In 2018 the band performed at a concert to raise awareness of the issue.

Jim Johnsen

James Roland Johnsen was the 14th president of the University of Alaska system from 2015 until his resignation in June 2020.
Education.
His education includes a BA in politics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, master's in political science from the University of Chicago, and an EdD in higher education management from the University of Pennsylvania.
Early career.
Prior to joining the university, Johnsen held executive leadership positions in the private sector with Alaska Communications and with Doyon, Limited, and in higher education at the University of Minnesota and the University of Alaska between 1992-2008 in executive roles including director of labor relations, vice president of administration and chief of staff. He was also a visiting scholar at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley in 2002.
President of University of Alaska system.
Johnsen was appointed the president of the University of Alaska system on July 28, 2015. As the system president, his priorities included a systemwide Title IX compliance effort, remedying UA's historic land grant deficit, restructuring of academic programs and administrative services of the university to increase student success and reduce cost, aligning with Alaska's primary and secondary education sectors, and a systemwide push to achieve the State of Alaska's goal for 65 percent of Alaska's working age population to have a post-secondary degree or certificate of value by 2025.
University of Alaska System budget cuts.
Johnsen assumed the role of president during a period of budget cuts. The system had taken consecutive years of budget cuts as the state struggled with collapsed oil revenues. Johnsen made the case for supporting Alaska's higher education system, both extolling the virtues of education and the role the university can play in bolstering the state's economy. In July 2019, Johnsen presented possible structuring models for the university in the wake of declaration of financial exigency after 41% cuts to state funding. He said that "severe cuts were the only way to deal with the system's budget crisis". With support from the Board of Regents, in August 2019 Johnsen negotiated a Compact Agreement with the Governor to reduce the 41% cut in one year to a 21% cut over three years, saving UA $265 million.
Votes of No Confidence.
Johnsen faced votes of no confidence during his tenure, in 2017 and 2019, from both students and faculty at two universities. One vote, which included no confidence in the Board of Regents, voiced concern about integration of teacher education programs. Another expressed faculty opposition to using a single email platform shared with other universities in the UA system. These votes of no confidence cited "a series of coercive and intimidating letters that UA President Jim Johnsen sent to the chancellors of UAA, UAF, and UAS," as directed by the Board of Regents, a letter of concern about accreditation standards regarding clearly defined governance roles from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and "a general trend of disregard for the wants and needs of the individual campuses in favor of President Johnsen’s plans."
Resignation.
Johnsen tendered his resignation amid blowback from a Wisconsin job search, among other reasons. Johnsen's resignation was accepted by the University of Alaska Board of Regents on June 22, 2020. He continued to be the president until July 1, 2020.
Public Service.
Johnsen is a commissioner on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, a commissioner on the Denali Commission and a member of the board of directors of the Alaska Aerospace Corporation. He is past chair of the Alaska EPSCoR, chair of the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education, vice-chair of the Alaska Student Loan Corporation, vice-chair of the University of Alaska Foundation, and member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of System Heads.
Candidacy for University of Wisconsin System President.
In June 2020, Johnsen was named the only named finalist in the University of Wisconsin system's presidential search. This is due in part to other applicants for this position withdrawing their names, fearing backlash for participating in this search during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to criticism from UW faculty, students who called it a "Failed result of a flawed search process". 
On June 12, 2020, Johnsen withdrew his name from consideration saying that the UW administration "have some important process issues to work out".

Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Company v. Burleson

Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Company v. Burleson, 255 U.S. 407 (1921), was a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the United States Postmaster General's power to revoke second-class mail privileges (the type of mail most newspapers and magazines qualify as) under the Espionage Act of 1917. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the owners of the Milwaukee Leader, a socialist daily newspaper in Milwaukee, Wisconsin due to Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson's revocation of the Leader's second-class mailing privileges on the grounds of "past" anti-war articles it had published. The court ruled 7–2 in favor of the federal government, with Justice Clarke delivering the majority opinion while Justices Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. dissented.
Legal background.
In 1917, Congress enacted the Espionage Act, which was intended to prohibit interference with the United States war effort during World War I. Both state and Federal government entities targeted left-wing organizations and publications under the Act. Despite numerous challenges to the Act's constitutionality, largely on First Amendment grounds, the Supreme Court sustained the Act as constitutional. Under the Act, the Federal government frequently denied access to the public mail system to leftist organizations and publications. The socialist publication "The Masses" challenged this regulation in "Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten", 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), in which a federal district court found the practice unconstitutional. This ruling was subsequently undermined by Supreme Court decisions about the Act from 1918 through 1921. 
Clash with Burleson.
In 1911, the Office of the Postmaster General granted the Milwaukee Leader, published by the Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Company, the privilege of second-class mail status. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Milwaukee Leader began running articles condemning United States involvement:[I]t was declared in the quoted articles that the war was unjustifiable and dishonorable on our part, a capitalistic war, which had been forced upon the people by a class to serve its selfish ends. Our government was denounced as a "plutocratic republic," a financial and political autocracy, and resident Russians were praised for defaming it. Other articles denounced the draft law as unconstitutional, arbitrary, and oppressive, with the implied counsel that it should not be respected or obeyed, and it was represented that soldiers in France were becoming insane in such numbers that long trains of closed cars were being used to convey them away from the battle front. It was confidently asserted that the Constitution of the United States was purposely made difficult of amendment in order that we might not have real democracy in this country, the President was denounced as an autocrat, and the war legislation as having been passed by a "rubber stamp Congress."As a result, the Postmaster General held a hearing on September 22, 1917, to revoke the Milwaukee Leader's second class status and declare its newspaper "unmailable." Though the Milwaukee Leader was represented at the hearing, the Postmaster General found against the newspaper, and revoked its second class status and barred it from use of the postal system. The government based its decision on allegations that the newspaper published "false reports and false statements . . . with intent to interfere with the success of military operations" of the United States, to assist in the success of the Central Powers, and to interfere with military recruitment.f
Decision.
Majority.
Justice Clarke penned the majority opinion on behalf of Chief Justice Taft and Justices McKenna, Day, Devanter, Pitney, and McReynolds.
Clarke said of the anti-war articles run by the Leader: "[They] contained false reports and false statements, published with intent to interfere with the success of the military operations of our government, to promote the success of its enemies, and to obstruct its recruiting and enlistment service. For this cause, exercising the power which we have seen had been invested in the Postmaster General by statute for almost 40 years, and which had frequently been exercised by his predecessors, the respondent revoked the second-class privilege which had been granted to the relator." Clarke also made reference to the Espionage Act being a legitimate, constitutional piece of legislature.
Dissent.
Justice Brandeis wrote a lengthy dissent on the subject, questioning the Postmaster General's powers in light of due process, where he called the Leader's punishment "not only unusual in character; it is, so far as known, unprecedented in American legal history." The vague and sweeping nature of the Postmaster General's powers exercised outside of wartime also disturbed Brandeis, and he concluded the body of his dissent by saying "If, under the Constitution, administrative officers may, as a mere incident of the peacetime administration of their departments, be vested with the power to issue such orders as this, there is little of substance in our Bill of Rights, and in every extension of governmental functions lurks a new danger to civil liberty."
Justice Holmes, who dissented along with Brandeis, had a much shorter dissent. Agreeing with much of what Brandeis had already said, Holmes echoed Brandeis' contention that the powers afforded the Postmaster General by Congress were unprecedented and a threat to free speech: "The United States may give up the post office when it sees fit, but, while it carries it on, the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues, and it would take very strong language to convince me that Congress ever intended to give such a practically despotic power to any one man. There is no pretence that it has done so. Therefore, I do not consider the limits of its constitutional power. . .[the revocation] was unjustified by statute and was a serious attack upon liberties that not even the war induced Congress to infringe."

Monasteries and churches at Mount Olympus

The Christianization of the Olympus region began relatively early. While the episcopal seats from Byzantine times only remaining ruins, inhabited and used monasteries and churches are still present at this time at Olympus. Some of the monasteries are a stauropegion, ie they are directly subordinate to the Patriarch of Constantinople (Istanbul), others belong to a diocese. The number of churches and chapels around Mount Olympus is hard to overlook. That is why only the monasteries and most important churches are mentioned.
History.
On his journey from Jerusalem to Corinth, in the first half of the 1st century, the apostle Paul also visited the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. His 1st Letter to the Thessalonians is one of the oldest writings of Christendom. Paul founded Christian communities, among others in Macedonia and Greece. In the 4th century Dion became the first bishopric of the region.
Byzantine ecclesiastical buildings.
Dion.
The basilica of the bishop was built in two phases. It was started in the 4th century. After being destroyed by an earthquake, it was completed in the 5th century. It was a three-nave church with narthex. A smaller building, west of the church, served as a baptistery.
Louloudies.
This fortress-like episcopal seat was built in the last quarter of the 5th century. It is probably the same place that was called Anamon in Roman records. In the middle of the 6th century, the buildings were destroyed by an earthquake. The bishop left the place and it was used in the subsequent period as a cemetery.
Pydna.
Remains of two 4th-century and 6th-century basilicas were discovered at Pydna. The younger of the two basilicas was burned down by Bulgars after the conquest of Pydna. At the end of the 10th century, a 23 by 17 meters large basilica was built on their instead. In 1204, Frankish knights, probably after a siege, conquered the place and destroyed it. The remains of the basilica were turned into a fortress.
Monastery Kanalon.
In 1055 the monks Joakim and Daniamos founded a monastery on the south side of Mount Olympus, located above the river Ziliana. The French archaeologist Heuzey dated the founding of the monastery to the year 955. After the monks abandoned the monastery at the beginning of the 20th century, it is now inhabited by nuns.
Monastery Petra.
In the 11th century, the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin (Isodion tis Theotoko) was built in Petra. Today there is a sanatorium in this place.
Monastery Agia Triada, Sparmos.
At least since the year 1386 the existence of the monastery is documented. After being abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century, it has been inhabited by monks for several years now.
Church Panagia, Kontariotissa.
The exact date of the construction of this church is unknown. The kind of the construction and the decoration inside the church point to the 7th century. It is interesting that obviously building material from the nearby Dion was used.
Post-Byzantine ecclesiastical buildings.
Monastery Agios Dionysios, Litochoro.
In 1542 the monastery was founded by Saint Dionysios and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. During its history, the monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times. In April 1943 it was blown up by the German Wehrmacht. The monks left the monastery and retreated to the Metochi founded in 1650, which gradually became the new monastery of Agios Dionysios.
Chapel of the Prophet Elias.
The chapel was founded in the 16th century by Saint Dionysios, who probably lived there for a time. It stands on the top of Mount Profitis Elias, one of the peaks of Olympus, at an altitude of 2803 meters and is the highest chapel of the Orthodox Church in the world. The chapel is purportedly built on ancient ruins.
Monastery Klimadon.
About 7 kilometers north of the town of Karya in 1640 the monastery of Agia Triada (Holy Trinity) was built. It was located at an altitude of 1320 meters and was also known by the name monastery Klymendou or simply as an old monastery (Palaiomonastirio). In 1823 it was partially burned down by the Ottomans, in 1833 one of the monks caused a fire that completely destroyed the monastery. Since 1913, a chapel stands at that place.

Manual labor college

A manual labor college was a type of school in the United States, primarily between 1825 and 1860, in which work, usually agricultural or mechanical, supplemented academic activity.
The manual labor model was intended to make educational opportunities more widely available to students with limited means, and to make the schools more viable economically. The work was seen as morally beneficial as well as healthful; at the time, this was innovative and equalitarian thinking.
According to the trustees of the Lane Theological Seminary:
These "colleges" usually included what we would today (2019) call high school ("preparatory") as well as college level instruction. At the time, the only public schools were at the elementary level, and there were no rules distinguishing colleges from high schools.
The four states with the largest number of such schools were New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.
George W. Gale.
George W. Gale was the founder of the first and best-known American example, the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry, and he thought the concept was his, although there are European predecessors. He and many of the other pious Yankees were persuaded that manual labor was to be the central practical feature of the coming American, Christian program of education. In 1830 Gale wrote: "Depend on it, Brother Finney, none of us have estimated the importance of this System of Education. It will be to the moral world what the lever of Archimedes, could he have found a fulcrum, would have been to the natural." As he put it slightly later, in his circular and plan for Knox College, "the manual labor system, if properly sustained and conducted, ...is peculiarly adapted...to qualify men for the self-denying and arduous duties of the gospel ministry, especially in our new settlements and missionary fields abroad."
Theodore Weld and the Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions.
Theodore Dwight Weld had studied under Gale for three years, and was convinced of the wisdom of the manual labor movement. He was a highly successful young lecturer on temperance, and caught the attention of the philanthropist Tappan brothers, Arthur and Lewis. They invited him to New York and tried to get him to accept an appointment as minister, but he declined, saying he was not prepared. Since he was "a living, breathing, and eloquently-speaking exhibit of the results of manual-labor-with-study,", the brothers, trying to support and encourage him, hired him for a year as an agent of the manual labor movement. For the purpose they created in 1831 a Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions, "literary institutions" being non-theological schools, as in "In every literary institution there are a number of hours daily, in which nothing is required of the student." The only known activities of the Society were hiring Weld for the year 1832, hosting him as speaker,
and publishing his report.
According to its constitution, it was "the object of this society to collect and diffuse information, calculated to promote the establishment and prosperity of manual labor schools and seminaries in the United States, and to introduce the system of manual labor into institutions now established." The Society's charge to Weld is lost, but to judge from his 100-page, carefully organized report, he was charged with traveling and investigating manual labor education as it then existed, and making suggestions for its improvement and prosperity. "We wish you to keep a minute and accurate journal of your tour, embracing all the facts which you collect, with such remarks and inferences as you may think proper." He was also "to ascertain to what extent the manual labor system was suited to conditions in the West" (the Ohio valley). He was "to find a site for a great national manual labor institution where training for the western ministry could be provided for poor but earnest young men who had dedicated their lives to the home missionary cause in the 'vast valley of the Mississippi.'"
In Weld's January, 1833, report to the Society he stated that "In prosecuting the business of my agency, I have traveled during the year four thousand five hundred and seventy-five miles miles [7,364 km]; in public conveyances [boat and stagecoach], 2,630 [4,230 km]; on horseback, 1,800 [2,900 km]; on foot, 145 [233 km]. I have made two hundred and thirty-six public addresses." A newspaper published a summary of his report:
Weld recommended Cincinnati, which he visited twice, as "the logical location [for the new school]. Cincinnati was the focal center of population and commerce in the Ohio valley." The new and barely-functioning Lane Theological Seminary in Walnut Hills, Ohio, near Cincinnati, was coincidentally looking for students. On Weld's recommendation, the Tappans chose it as the site for a national institution. See Lane Theological Seminary for more on it. With Weld very much at the head of it, the first national debate on slavery in the United States was held there, followed by the first organized student movement; students resigned "en masse", many going to the new Oberlin Collegiate Institute.
The need for a New England school.
The New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society, at its first convention, in 1834, passed a resolution expressing its support for the New England Anti-Slavery Society's resolution calling for a manual labor school "in some most eligible portion of New England", to address "the general want of mental cultivation of the colored population of our country".
Incomplete list of manual labor schools.
A considerable list of other manual labor schools, and not just in Indiana, is found on pp. 74–77 of Richard Gause Boone's "A History of Education in Indiana" (1892). Boone calls the manual labor movement "a 'craze', that soon ran its course (p. 76).
The failure of manual labor in colleges.
Although a variety of colleges incorporated manual labor to some degree, in most cases it was abandoned after only a few years, and it was all but gone by 1850. According to Herbert Lull, the reasons for its failure are:
As summarized by Geoffrey Blodgett in his analysis of its quick disappearance at Oberlin:
However, "the 'manual labor' movement waxed and waned in the 1830s, but in one form or another, its ideas never died." It is a predecessor of the land-grant university, a generation later.

Chung Eui-yong (; born 14 April 1946) is a South Korean diplomat and a politician currently serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Moon Jae-in from February 2021 after serving as his first Director of National Security from 2017 to 2020.
Career.
A 1968 graduate of Seoul National University, Chung joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1971. He subsequently served as Korean Ambassador to Israel (1997–1998), Deputy Minister for Trade (1998–2001), and as Korean Ambassador to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Korea to the UN Secretariat and International Organizations in Geneva (2001–2004). He was returned to the 17th National Assembly in the 2004 elections as a proportional representative for the Uri Party. In the National Assembly, he was a member of the Special Committee on United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement. He then became Secretary-General of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties. On 20 May 2017, newly-inaugurated president Moon Jae-in appointed him as the ministerial-level Director of the National Security Office. In January 2021, he replaced Kang Kyung-hwa as the new South Korean Foreign Minister. 
In July 2020, Chung was replaced by Suh Hoon and reshuffled to President Moon's Special Advisor on Foreign Affairs, Diplomacy and National Security.
Political activity.
In March 2018, as South Korea's Special Envoy to North Korea, Chung Eui-yong visited Pyongyang to discuss the required steps to denuclearise North Korea. He then flew to the United States for a meeting with President Donald Trump and to announce the Trump-Kim summit.
On November 4, 2019, at a waiting room on the sidelines of the ASEAN Plus 3 (Japan, China, and South Korea) summit held near Bangkok, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked with South Korean President Moon Jae-in for 11 minute, Chung Eui-yong took photos, and they were published without the approval of the Japanese side.
Chung had been in charge of bilateral intelligence-sharing agreement, the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), with Japan.

Chuchel

Chuchel () is a 2018 video game developed by Amanita Design.
Story.
The game follows the protagonist Chuchel, a Dust-style creature, as he tries to retrieve a cherry stolen by a giant one early morning, with his all-in-one best friend, enemy and pet Kekel either helping or hindering him on the way. The game is structured into short, loosely connected episodes of Chuchel's struggles to retrieve and keep the cherry; the episodic nature is emphasized by some levels showing the title.
In the last level, it is revealed that the giant hand teasing Chuchel with the cherry is in fact a larger Chuchel-style creature named Chrchel; it swallows Chuchel and Kekel who retrieve the cherry from its stomach, and climb up to its brain to switch it from "grumpy" to "happy". The now-happy giant then delivers Chuchel and Kekel back to their home, where they finally split and eat the cherry, only to get a huge pile brought by the giant, who then starts chasing a large pear carried by an even larger hand.
Gameplay.
The game consists of 30 levels. The player controls the eponymous Chuchel whose task is to retrieve a cherry. Levels are different and most of them are played as point-and-click adventure but some consist of minigames including spoofs of "Pac-Man", "Flappy Bird", "Tetris", "Space Invaders", "Donkey Kong" and Super Mario Bros. When Chuchel retrieves the Cherry, antagonist Chrchel shows up and steals it. Chuchel is aided by his pet Kekel who helps him to get the Cherry.
Development.
The game was developed by Amanita Design. Designer Jaromír Plachý started to work on the game after he finished Botanicula in 2012. Plachý stated that he wanted to make an interactive cartoon with funny animation. He came up with the character of Chuchel (the word "chuchel" does not "officially" exist, but it's an apparent combination of two similar Czech words "chumel" (clamp or tangle) and "chuchvalec" (tangled mass or clot)) when he decided to draw the first thing that comes to his mind. Plachý then designed environments and turned them into actual levels.
On December 20, 2018, Amanita Design released an update for the game changing Chuchel's body color to orange, in response to the character being misinterpreted by some reactions as a racist stereotype called Blackface. Some levels were also slightly changed to match Chuchel's new colour.
Reception.
"Chuchel" received generally positive reviews from critics. It holds 81/100 on Metacritic.
On review aggregate "OpenCritic", "Chuchel" had an average 80 out of 100 review score with 67% approval rating based on 20 reviews.

1978 UK Athletics Championships

The 1978 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh.
It was the second edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1978 AAA Championships.
Sonia Lannaman defended her 100 metres/200 metres sprint double from 1977. Allan Wells took his first sprint double on the men's side and Jane Colebrook managed a double in the 400 metres and 800 metres. Athletes to retain their titles from 1977 included Lannaman, sprint hurdlers Berwyn Price and Sharon Colyear, Geoff Capes (men's shot put), Meg Ritchie (women's discus) and Tessa Sanderson (women's javelin).
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1978 European Athletics Championships. Two athletes at the UK event won individual medals at European level: the men's 800 m champion Sebastian Coe was a European bronze medallist and women's javelin throw champion Sanderson was European runner-up. The top three in the UK women's 200 m (Beverley Goddard, Kathy Smallwood, and Lannaman) plus hurdles champion Colyear teamed up to take a 4 × 100 metres relay European silver.
The four countries of the United Kingdom competed separately at the Commonwealth Games that year as well, and UK champions who won there were Wells, Price, Lannaman, Capes, Sanderson, Paula Fudge (3000 m), Sue Reeve (long jump). The same relay quartet of the European Championships also took the Commonwealth Games title for England.

Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons

Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons, formerly Gwendolyn Robinson, is an Assistant Professor of Religion at the University of Florida, where she researches Islamic feminism and the impact of Sharia law on Muslim women. She was a civil rights activist, serving as a member of both the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Nation of Islam (NOI). Simmons has received a number of prestigious fellowships, including a Fulbright Fellowship, USAID Fellowships, and an American Center of Oriental Research Fellowship.
Early life and education.
Gwendolyn Zoharah Simmons was born in Memphis, Tennessee, where she was raised by her Baptist grandmother, Rhonda Bell Robinson. The great-granddaughter of a slave, Simmons was raised with the knowledge of her family history and the ways in which it was affected by slavery and its legacies. Her family valued and encouraged her to pursue education, and she became the first in her family to attend college.
Simmons enrolled at Spelman College in 1962. Soon after she began classes, she was summoned by the dean of students, who deemed her natural hair to be an "embarrassment" to the school and its expectations that students be "well-groomed." This would become one of several disputes Simmons experienced with the Spelman administration as her involvement with student activism began to increase.
In 1989, Simmons completed her B.A. at Antioch University, where she studied Human Services. She went on to study at Temple University, receiving an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Religion with a focus on Islam, and a Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies. She wrote her dissertation on "The Contemporary Impact of Shari'ah Law on Women's Lives in Jordan and Palestine."
Student activism.
Simmons was inspired to get involved in the civil rights movement by two of her professors, Staughton Lynd and Esta Seaton, who contextualized the current movement with historic African-American struggle. Also influential in Simmons' increasing activism were Howard Zinn, Spelman's History Department head, and Vincent Harding and Rosemarie Freeny Harding, co-directors of Atlanta's Mennonite House. Simmons began volunteering at the nearby Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) headquarters alongside SNCC chair John Lewis, SNCC executive secretary James Forman, and fellow Spelman student Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson. Simmons was careful to participate in office work only, where she was less likely to draw attention from her family and from the Spelman administration. She also became involved with the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights early on during her time at Spelman.
In 1963, she successfully ran to become a Spelman representative to SNCC's coordinating committee. In early January 1964, Simmons was arrested along with other Spelman students for participating in a lunch-counter demonstration at Lester Maddox's Pickrick restaurant. She spent a night in jail and was again summoned by the dean of students, who put her on academic probation for violating Spelman's prohibitions on civil rights demonstrations. This did not prevent Simmons from participating in another sit-in at a Krystal restaurant a few days later, where she was once again arrested. This time, she spent three nights in jail, was rebuked by Spelman President Manley, and had her scholarship revoked. In light of these punitive measures, friends and fellow demonstrators throughout the Atlanta University Center rallied to Simmons' support, organizing a march to President Manley's house. As a consequence, Simmons was allowed to remain at Spelman, though under strict probation. Simmons continued taking classes during the spring of 1964, and she assisted Staughton Lynd in developing curriculum for the upcoming Mississippi Freedom Summer Project and preparing materials for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
Engaged by Freedom Summer materials and encouraged by fellow students, Staughton Lynd, and Vincent Harding, Simmons decided to spend the summer of 1964 volunteering with the Mississippi Freedom project. Spelman administrators informed Simmons' family of this decision, who feared for Simmons' safety in working in an area known for Ku Klux Klan violence. They acted decisively to prevent her from leaving, bringing her home and intercepting correspondence from SNCC. Through covert money transfers from SNCC, Simmons was finally able to travel to Mississippi, much to the dismay of her family. Despite this disapproval, Simmons traveled to Oxford, Ohio for orientation, and then on to Mississippi. In Oxford, Simmons served as project trainer, working with Staughton Lynd in his capacity as orientation director, as well as Vincent Harding.
In Mississippi, Simmons was sent to the city of Laurel in Jones County, an area notorious for Klan violence. In this environment, Simmons feared for her life, regularly encountering hostility and police harassment. When her project director, Lester McKinney, was sent to jail, Simmons was appointed to replace him, despite her lack of field organizing experience. She thus became one of only seven female Freedom Summer project directors. Under Simmons' direction, Freedom Summer volunteers operated a Freedom School, opened a day care, registered voters, and established a library.
Civil rights activism.
1964-1966.
At the end of Freedom Summer, Simmons decided to stay in Laurel rather than return to Spelman. While Simmons worked in Laurel, she resided in the nearby city of Hattiesburg, since Laurel was too dangerous to live in. She served as freedom school director of SNCC's Laurel Mississippi project, providing curriculum development for freedom schools. As a young, black, and female leader in SNCC, Simmons faced both racism and sexism. She was also fearful of sexual violence, given that she was responsible for a predominantly white and male cohort of volunteers and had already experienced sexual violence during her orientation session in Ohio. Accordingly, she created an anti-sexual harassment policy for the Laurel Project, which she named the "Amazon Project." The policy was one of the first of its kind in SNCC. It was during her time in Mississippi that Simmons began identifying as a feminist.
In 1965, after spending eighteen months in Laurel, Simmons returned to Atlanta, psychologically scarred by the violence she had witnessed. At the recommendation of James Forman, she took a break from organizing and worked as a fundraiser in SNCC's New York City office.
A year later, Simmons returned to activism in the South. In 1966, she was hired as co-director on the newly formed SNCC Atlanta Project alongside fellow SNCC activist Bill Ware in the Vine City neighborhood. The Atlanta Project was an early grassroots expression of Black Power, focusing its efforts on political mobilization and urban improvement. Simmons also continued her work with freedom school initiatives with the Project. Simmons used her time on the Atlanta Project to evaluate civil rights movement tactics and develop preliminary theories of Black Power. For instance, she helped draft the project's position paper on Black Power, which became controversial for its commentary on white members of SNCC.
Simmons harbored a number of frustrations with white SNCC organizers, who she felt disrespected her authority and used up resources in being trained to work in black communities. She therefore advocated for whites to work on racial justice issues in white communities, where they could work in parallel with black organizers. These stances, as expressed in the project's Black Power position paper, were controversial and not necessarily indicative of the views of SNCC leaders, including James Forman and head of research Jack Minnis. Simmons also joined black female SNCC activists in critiquing increasing interracial relationships between black men and white women, which were perceived as a rejection of black women.
In the late 1960s, Simmons left Atlanta for Philadelphia, where she spent twenty years working for the American Friends Service Committee. She also served as treasurer of the National Black Independent Party.
1967-1972.
During her time in SNCC, Simmons first heard Malcolm X on a record and was instantly drawn to his message. She officially joined the Nation of Islam (NOI) in 1967 and converted to Islam.
While a member of the NOI, Simmons also served as Midwest region coordinator for the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) while living in Chicago. From Chicago, Simmons and her husband Michael Simmons moved to New York, joining Minister Louis Farrakhan's Mosque No. 7.
In her reflections of her time spent with the NOI, Simmons expressed displeasure with the gender hierarchy that governed women's limited role in organizing: "Unlike the SNCC, however, there was really no place for a woman to exercise what I considered real leadership as it had been in SNCC. As I was to learn later, my role as a woman in the NOI was to be a 'symbol of purity and chastity' and to be obedient and submissive to male authority, and the hallmark of my existence was that of mother of many children and a dutiful wife and helper to my husband, to whom I should defer in all matters of importance." Simmons directly contravened NOI teachings in a number of ways, for instance, by using birth control despite the beliefs of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, who viewed birth control as an attack on black families. Simmons also refrained from wearing the Muslim Girls Training uniform and headscarf, choosing not to complicate her organizing efforts with religious expression.
Other criticisms Simmons expressed regarding the NOI concerned the emphasis on money that burdened poor members, the militaristic and gendered hierarchy, and the use of corporal punishments. She left the organization in 1972.
Islamic feminist research and advocacy.
Beginning in 1971, Simmons spent seventeen years as a disciple of Sufi Sheikh Muhammad Raheem Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, a renowned leader of Islamic mysticism. Simmons received the name "Zoharah" from Muhaiyaddeen. She was one of his first American students, and she remains an active member of the Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship and Mosque.
As part of her work in academia, Simmons researched the contemporary impact of Sharia law on Muslim women in various communities, traveling to Jordan, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. She also spent some time living in Amman, Jordan, in order to conduct research for her academic dissertation.
Her teaching at the University of Florida centers on race, gender, and religion, particularly on African American religious traditions and women's relationship with Islam. In her current work, she seeks to separate the religion of Islam with various cultural interpretations, sometimes looking to history for forgotten and dismissed interpretations. She believes that only through gender equality will Islam be able to successfully thrive in America, and has expressed dismay over the ignorance in American Muslim communities of the Islamic feminist movement. She additionally believes that Islamic feminism recalls the respect for women expressed in the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's teachings that has been forgotten in more modern interpretations.
Her writings also address issues facing African Americans, such as teen pregnancy, as well as broader concerns related to Third World inequities.
Personal life.
Simmons formed a romantic relationship with Michael Simmons, a fellow Atlanta Project organizer, after recruiting him in 1965 to work on Julian Bond's campaign for a Georgia state legislature seat. The couple was required to marry upon joining the Nation of Islam in order to continue living together.
They have one daughter, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, who is a feminist documentary filmmaker. Both Simmons and her daughter have been outspoken about Aishah's experiences with rape and incest.

Floria Pinkney

Floria Pinkney was a Progressive Era garment worker and union activist from Brooklyn, New York. She was the first African-American woman to hold a leadership role as an organizer within the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
Early life and education.
Pinkney was born in Connecticut. Her parents were both originally from Florida. After Pinkney's birth, her then widowed mother moved to Brooklyn where she became a self-employed dressmaker. Before working in the garment industry, Pinkney attended Manhattan Trade School. In 1925 Pinkney received a scholarship to Brookwood Labor College sponsored by the American Fund for Public Service (AFPS), which supported radical political causes. Her scholarship at Brockwood was extended two years due to her academic success, and Pinkney was recognized as a class speaker at graduation. Upon graduating, Pinkney become the first Black female to graduate from Brookwood Labor College. In 1930, Pinkney won an award from the New York School of Social Work to do a 6 month Fellowship at the University of Copenhagen. This fellowship focused on work that was being done in Denmark in adult education and social organization. 
Activism.
Pinkney joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in the 1920s and was quickly identified as a promising leader. She worked for several years before attending Brockwood Labor College. After graduating, she returned to the industry but was quickly appointed as a union organizer in 1929. Pinkney was instrumental in the IGLWU's September 1929 drive to enroll black garment workers. She spoke alongside A. Philip Randolph, who lead the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and ILGWU Vice President Julius Hochman at St. Luke's in Harlem. Randolph endorsed Pinkney as an organizer for the ILGWU, calling her "a capable young woman". Pinkney worked beyond the garment district and was active in both the Harlem and Brooklyn communities. Pinkney attended the 1930 YWCA national convention, where she was selected to represent the Industrial Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland.

Laura Haim (or Laurence Haim, as she is known in France) is a French-American journalist. She was born on May 20, 1966 in Paris, France.
Career.
Pre-Obama.
She was a former correspondent at the CAPA agency in Washington (led by Hervé Chabalier) where she worked between 1989 and 1995. She was one of the first journalists there and was associated with the production of programs like "24 hours" on Canal +, "Envoyé spécial" (the French 60 Minutes) on France 2, and "Zone interdite" on M6.
As a foreign correspondent for CAPA, she covered international events such as the famine in Somalia, the beginning of the war in Bosnia, and the situation in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.
In 1992, Laura moved to New York to pursue her interest in working in the U.S. She created the first office for Canal Plus Group, where she worked as a correspondent until 2001.
After September 11, 2001, Laura was sent on assignment to Israel. A suicide bombing occurred there, which she began documenting. At the time, Dan Rather of CBS News was also on location. After meeting her, he decided to hire her to work as a producer and video journalist for CBS News.
From 2002 to 2006, Laura was mainly based in Baghdad, where she covered the Iraq war and the Near East for CBS.
Obama's campaign and presidential mandate.
Haim went back to the United States in October 2006. At that point, she suggested to Canal Plus that she follow Barack Obama's campaign. In 2008, she became an accredited White House and Pentagon correspondent for Canal Plus Group and moved to Washington, D.C. to follow the Obama administration on a daily basis. In June 2009, she conducted another interview with the President Obama, which aired on Canal +. She also covered the sex scandal involving Dominique Strauss-Khan, the former managing director of the IMF who wanted to run for president in France.
Haim covered news and became a regular face on the 24-hour cable news channel of Canal Plus, I-Télé, which aired in over 60 French-speaking countries, including those in Africa.
She also founded the first group for the foreign White House correspondents accredited to the White House. From 2009 to 2014 she was twice elected president of the White House Foreign Press Association by her peers.

In 2015 Laura obtained an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the war in Gaza, and was also the only French journalist able to do so. In 2016 she also did an interview for French television with one of the Navy Seals who said he killed Osama bin Laden during the raid.
She has also traveled to Guantanamo on more than eight occasions to document the 9/11 pre-trials.
The French presidential campaign with Emmanuel Macron.
To the surprise of many, Laura was offered the position of spokesperson for international affairs for Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign, and she joined his team in December 2016.
On July 12, 2017, after President Macron’s campaign, Laura decided to come back to the United States and join the Institute of Political Studies at the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, headed by David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama. She became a fellow there.
Awards.
In 2013 and 2014 she was named in France Best Foreign Correspondent and also received the award "Femme en Or, Media Woman of the Year." The news magazine "France-Amérique" featured her as one of the most important French people living in the U.S.

Election security

Election cybersecurity or election security refers to the protection of elections and voting infrastructure from cyberattack or cyber threat – including the tampering with or infiltration of voting machines and equipment, election office networks and practices, and voter registration databases.
Cyber threats or attacks to elections or voting infrastructure could be carried out by insiders within a voting jurisdiction, or by a variety of other actors ranging from nefarious nation-states, to organized cyber criminals to lone-wolf hackers. Motives may range from a desire to influence the election outcome, to discrediting democratic processes, to creating public distrust or even political upheaval.
United States.
The United States is characterized by a highly decentralized election administration system. Elections are a constitutional responsibility of state and local election entities such as secretaries of state, election directors, county clerks or other local level officials encompassing more than 6,000+ local subdivisions nationwide.
However, election security has been characterized as a national security concern increasingly drawing the involvement of federal government entities such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In early 2016, Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security designated elections as “critical infrastructure” making the subsector eligible to receive prioritized cybersecurity assistance and other federal protections from the Department of Homeland Security. The designation applies to storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments. In particular, hackers falsifying official instructions before an election could affect voter turnout or hackers falsifying online results after an election could sow discord.
Post 2016 Election.
Election security has become a major focus and area of debate in recent years, especially since the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. In 2017, DHS confirmed that a U.S. foreign adversary, Russia, attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election via “a multi-faceted approach intended to undermine confidence in [the American] democratic process." This included conducting cyber espionage against political targets, launching propaganda or “information operations” (IO) campaigns on social media, and accessing elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.
On September 22, 2017, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified 21 states that they were targeted by Kremlin-backed hackers during the 2016 election. Those states included Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington,2 Arizona, California, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin. Currently, hackers only reportedly succeeded in breaching the voter registration system of one state: Illinois.
In the aftermath of the 2016 hacking, a growing bench of national security and cyber experts have emerged noting that Russia is just one potential threat. Other actors including North Korea, Iran, organized criminals possess, and individual hackers have motives and technical capability to infiltrate or interfere with elections and democratic operations. Leaders and experts have warned that a future attack on elections or voting infrastructure by Russian-backed hackers or others with nefarious intent, such as seen in 2016, is likely in 2018 and beyond.
One recommendation to prevent disinformation from fake election-related web sites and email spoofing is for local governments to use .gov domain names for web sites and email addresses. These are controlled by the federal government, which authenticates the legitimate government controls the domain. Many local governments use .com or other top-level domain names; an attacker could easily and quickly set up an altered copy of the site on a similar-sounding .com address using a private registrar.
In 2018 assessment of US state election security by the Center for American Progress, no state received an “A” based on their measurements of seven election security factors. Forty states received a grade of C or below.  A separate 2017 report from the Center for American Progress outlines nine solutions which states can implement to secure their elections; including requiring paper ballots or records of every vote, the replacement of outdated voting equipment, conducting post election audits, enacting cybersecurity standards for voting systems, pre-election testing of voting equipment, threat assessments, coordination of election security between state and federal agencies, and the allocating of federal funds for ensuring election security.
Europe.
Russia's 2016 attempts to interfere in U.S. elections fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade. Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Kremlin-backed hackers appeared aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining trust in public institutions that include government agencies, the media and elected officials. In late 2017, the United Kingdom through its intelligence agencies made claims that a Russian IO campaign played a damaging role in its Brexit referendum vote in June 2016.
Role of white hat hackers.
The "white hat" hacker community has also been involved in the public debate. From July 27–30, 2017, DEFCON – the world's largest, longest running and best-known hacker conference – hosted a “Voting Machine Hacking Village” at its annual conference in Las Vegas, Nevada to highlight election security vulnerabilities. The event featured 25 different pieces of voting equipment used in federal, state and local U.S. elections and made them available to white-hat hackers and IT researchers for the purpose of education, experimentation, and to demonstrate the cyber vulnerabilities of such equipment. During the 3-day event, thousands of hackers, media and elected officials witnessed the hacking of every piece of equipment, with the first machine to be compromised in under 90 minutes. One voting machine was hacked remotely and was configured to play Rick Astley's song "Never Gonna Give You Up." Additional findings of the Voting Village were published in a report issued by DEFCON in October 2017.
The "Voting Village" was brought back for a second year at DEF CON, which was held in Las Vegas, August 9–12, 2018. The 2018 event dramatically expanded its inquiries to include more of the election environment, from voter registration records to election night reporting and many more of the humans and machines in the middle. DEF CON 2018 also featured a greater variety of voting machines, election officials, equipment, election system processes, and election night reporting. Voting Village participants consisted of hackers, IT and security professionals, journalists, lawyers, academics, and local, state and federal government leaders. A full report was issued on the 2018 Village Findings at a press conference in Washington, DC, held on September 27, 2018.
Legislation and policy.
A variety of experts and interest groups have emerged to address U.S. voting infrastructure vulnerabilities and to support state and local elections officials in their security efforts. From these efforts have come a general set of policy ideas for election security, including:
Federal legislation has also been introduced to address these concerns. The first bipartisan Congressional legislation to protect the administration of Federal elections against cybersecurity threats – the Secure Elections Act (SB 2261) – was introduced on December 21, 2017 by Senator James Lankford (R-OK).
The 2018 Federal Budget (as signed by President Donald Trump) included $380m USD in state funding to improve election security. Each state received a standard payment of $3m USD, with the remaining $230m USD allocated to each state proportionally based on voting age population. Security measures funded included improving cybersecurity (36.3% of funds), the purchase of new voting equipment (27.8%), improvement of voter registration systems (13.7%), post election audits (5.6%), and improving communications efforts (2%).

Locomotives LVCI 1-50, 155-164

Locomotives LVCI 1-50 and 155-164 were 2-2-2 steam locomotives of the LVCI built for service on the railways of the Lombard-Veneto Kingdom. Numbers 1-50 were built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company and numbers 155-164 were built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company.
History.
The two series of locomotives entered service between 1857 and 1858. In 1859, following the Second Italian War of Independence, the LVCI network was divided into a Lombard part (Lombardy was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia) and a Venetian part (Veneto remained a possession of the Austrian Empire). Locomotives 1-50 were divided into LOMB 1-35 and VEN 1-15, while 155-164 were all assigned to the Venetian part with numbers VEN 16-25. In 1865, when the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) was established, the Lombard machines were taken into the stock of this company and became SFAI 31-65. The following year, after the Third Italian War of Independence, which resulted in the annexation of the Veneto region to the Kingdom of Italy, the 25 Veneto machines also came into SFAI stock and were numbered SFAI 66-90. The SFAI scrapped 10 machines in 1874, and rebuilt another 10 with 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, giving rise to the 301-311 series.
The great networks.
In 1885, with the creation of the great national networks, the locomotives were divided between the Adriatic Network (RA) and the Mediterranean Network (RM). The RA received 22 units, all of Robert Stephenson construction, and gave them numbers RA 31-52. The RM received all the Beyer Peacock units, which they numbered RM 501-510, and 8 Stephenson units, which they numbered RM 511-518.
Nationalization.
In 1905, with the establishment of Italian State Railways (FS), eight units were still in operation and they were registered as FS Class 102. They comprised four Stephenson units, numbered 1021-1024, and four Beyer Peacock, numbered 1025-1028. All the locomotives were scrapped before 1910, except one which survived long enough to be shown at the Esposizione di Torino in 1911, although it was scrapped soon afterwards.

Çöp şiş

Çöp Şiş (pronounced 'chop shish') is a type of lamb shish kebab eaten throughout Anatolia in Turkey. 
The etymology of the name is uncertain, though 'Çöp' means garbage or rubbish in modern Turkish, and may have come from the word meaning 'chaff', the stalk of wheat removed during winnowing. It has also been suggested that they are so called because the meat used is the smaller scraps of meat that are not used for other types of kebab.
Çöp şiş is generally cooked on wooden skewers rather than iron ones. During preparation, the lamb meat and pieces of fat are mixed with garlic and tomato and left to marinate with black pepper, oregano and olive oil, before cooking over an ocak, or grill.
It is usually served with grilled peppers and onion, with bread as an option to wrap the lamb and vegetables inside.

Marion Thompson Wright

Marion Thompson Wright (September 12, 1902 – October 26, 1962) was an African-American scholar and activist. In 1940, Wright became the first African-American woman in the United States to earn her Ph.D. in history.
Early life.
Marion Manola Thompson Wright was born in East Orange, New Jersey, on September 12, 1902, to Minnie Thompson and Moses R. Thompson. Wright was the youngest of four children, and had two older twin sisters and a brother who died at a young age.
Few details are available on Thompson's youth, but she attended Barringer High School in Newark, New Jersey. Even as a teenager, she expressed her frustrations with the New Jersey school system as one of two Black students at her high school.
Personal life.
At the age of 16, Wright married William Moss and had two children, Thelma and James. Wright made the decision to leave her children with her husband in order to continue to pursue her high school degree. This was due to the expectations that women were not to be accepted into higher universities if they were married or divorced. A few years later, Wright divorced from her husband, leaving her children with her mother while continuing to pursue her education. Wright married Arthur M. Wright, but divorced soon after.
Education.
After graduating from high school, Wright attended Howard University, where she received her bachelor's degree in 1927, before earning her master's in History and Education. After this, she attended Teachers College, Columbia University where she began her work on her dissertation. Wright completed her dissertation, "The Education of Negroes in New Jersey", which focused on the state of education for Blacks and its consistent segregated and unjust schools. Wright became the first Black woman in the United States to earn her Ph.D. in History in 1940.
After earning her Ph.D., Wright went back to Howard, where she taught. She began the "Negro History Bulletin" to educate students on their Black history. In the 1950s, she worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In addition, Wright's dissertation was incorporated into the Brown v. Board of Education argument.
Death and legacy.
At the age of 60, Wright's body was found unresponsive inside her car in her garage. Her death certificate states that she died of cardiopulmonary failure; however, some sources state that she committed suicide.
Each year, Rutgers University–Newark hosts an annual Marion Thompson Wright Lecture Series. The event is a part of the celebration of Black History Month and in February 2018, Rutgers celebrated their 38th annual lecture series.

He later ran the only gas station in Skykomish and was a ski instructor at Stevens Pass until 1962, when the new Crystal Mountain opened near Mount Rainier and the family relocated to Enumclaw. Nagel headed the ski school and race program; the racing school was featured in "Sports Illustrated" in 1963, with older daughter Cathy, 14, on the cover.
Younger daughter Judy Nagel was an Olympian and World Cup racer. At age sixteen in 1968, she led the Olympic slalom after the first run, but did not finish the second.

Sonata per archi

The String Sonata No. 1, commonly referred to by its original Italian name Sonata per archi, is a composition for string orchestra by German composer Hans Werner Henze. It was composed between 1957 and 1958.
Composition.
The sonata was commissioned by Paul Sacher for his own orchestra, the Collegium Musicum Zürich, together with his Double Concerto for Oboe, Harp and Strings, and was written between 1957 and early 1958. According to Henze, it was influenced by an earlier idea of Heinz von Cramer, the librettist of Henze's "König Hirsch", for a ballet about the Embarquement pour Cythère. It was premiered by Paul Sacher in Zurich on March 21, 1958. It was dedicated to Paul Sacher and his wife, Maya Sacher and was later published by Boosey &amp; Hawkes.
Structure.
The sonata is in two movements and has a total duration of 15 minutes. The movement list is as follows:
Its structure is nothing like a traditional sonata and displays the composer's distinctive serialist style. The first movement consists of a five-minute Stravinskian toccata, with plenty neo-classical features. It starts in E minor, but modulates in minor-third oscillations. The second movement is presumably influenced by Beethoven and consists of a set of attacca variations which are very difficult to distinguish by ear. It is scored for eight first violins, six second violins, four violas , four celli and two double basses.

Crawford family of the White Mountains

The Crawford family of the White Mountains were a family who moved to New Hampshire's White Mountains in the 1790s from Guildhall, Vermont, and were pioneers in establishing a tourist industry in that area. Abel Crawford and his father-in-law, Eleazar Rosebrook, began the effort, and one of Abel's sons, Ethan Allen Crawford, made significant contributions. Another son, Thomas Jefferson Crawford, continued the work; and Ethan's wife, Lucy, also contributed. Their work was in the area then known as White Mountain Notch, subsequently called Crawford Notch.
Numerous geographical features in the White Mountains are now named after the family.
Origins.
The origins of the Crawford family of the White Mountains, lie in the late-18th-century marriage of first cousins Abel Crawford and Hannah Rosebrook.
The date of birth of Abel, who was born in Guildhall, Vermont, is uncertain. His father was John, the third son of James Crawford, an Irish or Scotch-Irish man who had emigrated to Boston in 1726 and then settled in Union, Connecticut. John married Mary Rosebrook, with whom he had eleven children, including Abel.
Eleazar Rosebrook, who came from Grafton, Massachusetts, was Mary's brother. He had married Hannah Hanes of Brimfield, Massachusetts, in 1772, eventually having four sons and two daughters, including Abel's future wife, Hannah. The Rosebrooks had moved to the remote upper Connecticut River, where Colebrook now stands, but during the American Revolutionary War Eleazar was away, serving in the Continental Army, and his family relocated to Guildhall for safety. On his return from service, Eleazar established a successful farm there.
Life in the White Mountains.
Beginnings.
White Mountain Notch, as it was originally called, is a mountain pass that lies between the Presidential and Franconia Ranges of the White Mountains, an area which Kevin Avery described as an "inhospitable, indeed potentially lethal, wilderness" in the years immediately following the American Revolutionary War. Abel moved from Guildhall to settle at the northern end of the notch in 1790 with his wife, Hannah. He bought a cabin, which later became known as "Fabyan" or "Fabyans", from settlers there but soon sold it to his father-in-law, Eleazar Rosebrook, and moved south through the notch to Hart's Location. It was there that he built the inn, called Crawford House, where his son, Ethan Allen Crawford, was born in 1792.
An alternative chronology to this has Abel Crawford initially moving alone to the notch in 1791, leaving his wife in Guildhall while he constructed a cabin at a spectacular site on Nash and Sawyer's Location at Bretton Woods. Eleazar Rosebrook, who was restless despite the success of his farm in Guildhall, visited and agreed to buy the cabin when Abel decided it was insufficiently remote for his liking. Thus, Abel then moved to the even more spectacular Hart's Location and was joined there by his wife and two young sons, Erastus and Ethan Allen, who had been born in Guildhall in 1792. Eventually comprising Abel, Hannah, eight sons and a daughter, the Crawford family developed the new site, where the present-day Notchland Inn is situated, as a farm.
Eleazar Rosebrook established the first inn at the Notch in 1803 when the state of New Hampshire decided to build a turnpike that connected its northern and southern areas via the mountain pass. Such a device had been considered by settlers since the 1760s because people living in Lancaster and the surrounding area of the upper Connecticut River were forced to make a long, difficult detour via Haverhill in order to trade with places such as Portland and Portsmouth. The vast increase in traffic caused by this development gave Eleazar an opportunity to improve his fortunes. He constructed a two-story inn on a mound called Giant's Grave and supplemented it with a sawmill, a gristmill, stables and other buildings. Timothy Dwight IV was an early visitor to Eleazar's property and wrote approvingly of what he had achieved. The location and his reputation for hospitality made it a success, and Abel followed it by building his own inn, Crawford House, at Hart's Location.
Further development.
Until 1811, when Ethan left to join the army, father and son worked, hunted and fished together in the environs of the Notch. After leaving the army, Ethan was engaged in various jobs in New York state, including road-building and river transportation. He intended to settle in Louisville before deciding to return to the Notch at the request of the ailing Eleazar in 1816. Eleazar had developed cancer of the lip and was too feeble to run his farm and inn without assistance; in return for Ethan's help, Eleazar offered ownership of the property to Ethan. Thus, when Eleazar died in September 1817, Ethan inherited the property and also the mortgage on it, which he increased to develop the business further. He married his cousin, Lucy Howe, in November of the same year, having become close to her when she arrived at Giant's Grave to look after Eleazar, their mutual grandfather. On the night of July 18, 1818, being the same day that Lucy gave birth to their first child, the Old Moosehorn Tavern was destroyed by a fire caused by an unattended candle. There were uninsured losses of 3000, made worse because payments were still due on the mortgage, but Ethan nonetheless managed to build a smaller replacement building. This cramped replacement may not have been entirely new but in fact one already standing some from Giant's Grave, from whence it was moved with the aid of family and friends.
It was as a consequence of the fire that Ethan sought new opportunities to repair his ravaged finances. The area was beginning to attract tourists desirous of reaching the mountain peaks, and in 1819 Abel had already guided a couple of groups up the hills. Ethan was also approached and noted the difficulties that they experienced in negotiating the thickly-wooded terrain. Later that year, he and Abel together eased those problems by clearing woodland and grading a route for the first path to the summit of Mount Washington. Covering a distance of over , beginning at the top of what was then called White Mountain Notch, the path cut through forest past the tree line to reach a ridge near the peak of Bald Mountain, then traversed a bleak ridge and negotiated various other peaks before reaching its goal. It is today known as the Crawford Path, still mostly follows the original route and is considered to be the oldest White Mountains trail in continuous use. It may not, however, have been the first path to the summit: the mineralogist George Gibbs probably commissioned the creation of a crude path, now lost, on the eastern slopes in 1809.
Ethan, who has been described as "prodigiously strong", appears to have been the major worker on the original Crawford Path. The first travelers, guided by Abel, included Samuel Joseph May, who wrote an account of it. Ethan developed other trails in the area, including one initiated in 1821 whose route was closely followed later by the Mount Washington Cog Railway and which soon became more popular than the original path. His brother, Thomas Jefferson Crawford, together with guide Joseph Hall, who worked for him, improved the original path by converting it into a bridleway around 1840, allowing Abel, then in his 70s, to become the first person to ride a horse to the summit of the mountain. This change to the path was in response to increased competition from facilities by now being developed at Pinkham Notch.
Ethan constructed a shelter for travelers at the summit in 1821 and in 1823 built three stone huts there. At least one of the huts was fitted out with a stove, vegetation for bedding and a sheet of lead on which visitors could write their names with a nail, but they proved too uncomfortable and so he erected a tent capable of holding 18 people. The tent did not survive for long because of the high winds that are a feature of the mountain. Also in 1823, despite his precarious financial position, Ethan expanded his provision of accommodation by renting the Old Notch House, which had been built in 1793 and lay close to Abel's home, and by extending the Giant's Grave building.
Ethan was a capable guide for travelers using the trail, assisting surveyors such as a party that included John W. Weeks, botanists such as William Oakes, and, in 1821, the first women to ascend the summit, as well as the author Theodore Dwight. Lucy also had some involvement, making her own first ascent to the summit in 1825. Word of Ethan's abilities and deeds spread, gaining him a heroic status, with incidents such as one where he carried a bear on his shoulders, a feat immortalized in drawings and woodcut prints. Over time, the -tall Ethan gained the name "Giant of the Hills"; his father, who probably acted as a guide for the geologist Charles Lyell in the 1840s, was known as the "Patriarch of the Mountains". Abel also acted as the collector of tolls from people traveling over the Jefferson turnpike and, in the early 1830s, his strategic position there caused him to be suggested as someone who might assist authorities in monitoring smugglers who were then particularly active in the area.
Ethan knew how to exploit the attractions of the scenery to his best advantage, one example being that he took to greeting visitors by firing a cannon or blowing a horn at his door so that they could appreciate the natural echo. The number of visitors increased greatly following a natural disaster on August 28, 1826 that was publicised by Dwight in his "Northern Traveller" guidebook. A summer storm converted the Saco River into a raging torrent through the Notch valley and triggered landslides. The Willey family, who had taken occupation of the Old Notch House, died trying to outrun the water and the terrain was stripped bare, remaining that way for many years after with the house still standing in stark contrast to the desolation. Natural beauty and tragedy combined to entice visitors with an interest in morbid Romanticism and to inspire artists such as Thomas Cole. Dona Brown believes that Cole and such other visitors as Nathaniel Hawthorne used the interest in the tragedy to further their careers, deliberately painting and writing about an area that had suddenly gained national attention. Ethan, too, exploited it by, for example, ensuring that the Willey House was well signposted.
The Crawfords were directly affected by the storm: Ethan's property suffered 1000 of damage and Abel's farm was wrecked almost beyond repair. However, they were also affected in a positive manner with the subsequent influx of tourists. In 1828, Ethan began construction of a new inn, called the Notch House, at the northern end of the valley, appointing his brother Thomas to run it. The business opened in 1829 and attracted many notable people, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Daniel Webster. Ethan guided and hosted Nathaniel Hawthorne for several days in 1832, and Hawthorne later described the hotel in his "Sketches from Memory". It was particularly popular with artists because of its stunning setting and, despite being destroyed by fire in 1854, is still well-known because of its frequent depiction in their works.
Pavel Cenkl says that the Crawfords were "subsistence farmers, traders, and entrepreneurs". While Abel had apparently planted around 700 apple trees on his land, mostly for the purpose of making cider, by the 1830s Thomas was proposing that his own hotel would be a teetotal establishment.
Endings.
Competition for the tourist trade, which from the outset had been the monopoly of the Crawfords, increased with the greater interest in the area that followed the Willey disaster of 1826. The type of visitor changed, too, and the people who now flocked to the mountains disdained the relatively crude accommodation that the Crawfords could offer. Ethan took out a further mortgage in 1832 to finance a new two-story wing for the Old Moosehorn Tavern, hoping that it would counter the competition now coming from the new White Mountain House hotel. He continued to develop new trails and also tamed some animals to amuse visitors, as well as adding a bowling alley and dance floor, but he became less interested in acting as a guide and often employed people to do that for him. He developed rheumatism and a tumour that caused him constant pain, leading him to attempt unsuccessfully to sell his business in 1835. No-one was prepared to offer a price that would pay his debts but during this time he also befriended Samuel Bemis, a dentist and early photographer from Boston through whom he found a doctor who was able to relieve some of the tumour-related pain.
Ethan and Lucy had struggled financially since the fire of 1818, having taken on more debt for their various projects. They became vulnerable to the activities of land speculators and Ethan was eventually imprisoned for non-payment of debt. Unable to pay the mortgage that he had taken out in 1832, the couple left the area in 1837 after years of financial struggle. Their property was sold to repay their debts. Horace Fabyan leased the original farm and then bought it outright in 1841; he renamed the inn as Mount Washington House.
Unhappy with being distant from the mountains, Ethan and Lucy returned from their new abode in Guildhall in 1843, renting and re-opening the abandoned White Mountain House hotel, which stood about distant from their old home. Meanwhile, Ethan's sister, Hannah, had married Nathaniel T. P. Davis and the couple lived with Abel while continuing the family's connection with tourism. In 1844–1845, Davis constructed a new horse route from Crawford House inn at Hart's Location to the Mount Washington summit, via Mount Crawford, and managed the inn for some time. Although that route was never popular, a path created by Thomas for the ascent of Mount Willard led to the creation of one that is used today.
Ethan, who had at least two daughters and a son, died on June 22, 1846, at White Mountain House. Either in the same year or the one prior to it, Lucy published "The History of the White Mountains from the First Settlement of Upper Coos and Pequaket", which was written in Ethan's voice. Pavel Cenkl says that Lucy intended the book to be in large part a paean to Ethan, building up his image so that more people would might ask him to be their guide, although just as with the trails and inns, it was subsequent investors in the area's tourism industry who benefited from interest in it. The Crawfords had long had a reputation for eloquent story-telling about the mountains, although some people questioned the veracity of what they said. Following the death of Ethan, people began referring to White Mountain Notch as Crawford Notch.
Towards the end of his life, aged in his 80s, Abel Crawford was twice elected from Coos County to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, a part of the state legislature. He died in 1851 and is buried with his wife, Hannah at Notchland, a house built by Bemis at Hart's Location which still stands today as the Notchland Inn. Bemis had bought the property, on which Abel's Crawford House stood, in 1856 but the actual Crawford House building was probably torn down in 1900. Ethan and Lucy, who died in 1869 are buried in the same graveyard as Eleazar and his wife, not far from the Cog railway. Continued financial difficulties meant that Thomas Crawford and Nathaniel Davis both lost their properties, Notch House and Mount Crawford House, respectively, in the 1850s.
Legacy.
The significance of the Crawford Path is considerable. Christopher Johnson notes: 
By the mid-1850s there were numerous hotels in the White Mountains, including four that travel guide writer John H. Spaulding described at the time as "mammoth". There were also numerous transport routes to enable access from the cities, notably the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad that had been extended to Gorham.
Aside from Crawford Notch and the Crawford Path, the Crawfords are commemorated in the names of Mount Crawford, due to a suggestion made by Bemis, and also in the unincorporated area known as Crawford's Purchase, which is land east of Fabyan and Bretton Woods that was bought by Ethan Allen Crawford and brothers Thomas and Nathaniel Abbott in 1834. Other namings include Ethan Pond and Crawford Brook, as well as Mount Tom and Mount Tom Brook, which were both named after Thomas. Guidebooks have also extolled the virtues of Abel and Ethan.
The family's involvement in constructing trails continued with the work of Ethan A. Crawford II, who had an involvement in building a route at the Jefferson Notch pass near Mount Jefferson, over which he drove Chester B. Jordan, the then Governor of New Hampshire, at its opening in 1902.

History of the Knights of Columbus

The history of the Knights of Columbus begins with its founding in 1882 by Father Michael J. McGivney at St. Mary's Parish in New Haven, Connecticut. The Knights of Columbus was initially a mutual benefit society for a membership of practicing male Catholics. Today, it advocates for Catholic causes and provides a range of philanthropic and support services to Catholic institutions worldwide. It is also one of the world's largest insurance companies and operates the shrine to Pope John Paul II in Washington, D.C.
The order was designed to foster members' pride in both their Catholic and American heritages and to establish standards of behavior for Catholic gentlemen. It expanded beyond Connecticut and the United States to establish its first international councils by 1905. The organization provided relief to soldiers in wars throughout the 20th century and fought anti-Catholic and racial prejudice. Its substantial membership and financial resources have enabled it to exercise considerable influence within the Catholic church and to promote Catholic views in social and political discourse.
Early history.
Founding.
Michael J. McGivney, an American Catholic priest, founded the Knights of Columbus in New Haven, Connecticut. He gathered a group of men from St. Mary's Parish for an organizational meeting on October 2, 1881. It was incorporated on March 29, 1882. McGivney had originally conceived of the name "Sons of Columbus". James T. Mullen, who later led the organization, coined the name "Knights of Columbus", which expressed the ritualistic nature of the new organization and drew from positive historical associations.
The Order was intended to be a mutual benefit society. As a parish priest in an immigrant community, McGivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died. This was before most government support programs were established. He wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind. In his own life, he temporarily had to suspend his seminary studies to care for his family after his father died.
Because of religious and ethnic discrimination, Roman Catholics in the late 19th century were regularly excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See also prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism were compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their American–Catholic heritage.
Fraternal organizations, which combined social aspects and ritual, were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century, the so-called "Golden Age of Fraternalism. New Haven's Irish Catholic men of the era could have joined one of many other organizations, and Catholics of other ethnicities had additional options.
McGivney traveled to Boston to examine the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York to learn about the recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within that Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a new club.
Catholic and American.
Taking the name of Columbus was partially intended as a mild rebuke to Anglo-Saxon Protestant leaders, who upheld the explorer (a Genovese Italian Catholic who had worked for Catholic Spain) as an American hero, yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent Catholic immigrants. In taking Columbus as their patron, the founders expressed their belief that not only could Catholics be full members of American society, they were instrumental in its foundation.
Of the first 28 members of the first council, 16 were born in Ireland. A majority of the first generation of Knights across the Order were immigrants. Joining the Knights gave the recent immigrants a mantle of "middle-class American respectability without forfeiting their preexisting ethnic and religious identities", and gave them "a rhetorical foundation for claims to full American citizenship".
Unlike many other Catholic organizations of the time, though, the Knights placed a greater emphasis on loyalty to their new world republics than they did on old ethnic divisions of the old world. McGivney envisioned an organization that would imbue members "with a zealous pride in one's American–Catholic heritage". In Canada, a similar sentiment held among early members.
The model of Christian knighthood promoted by the Order "provided Catholic men with a positive interpretation of the separation they would have experienced relative to the Protestant-dominated social and political context in New Haven." The Order effused a sense that as Catholic gentlemen and Knights of Columbus they should be regarded as exemplars of virtue, not aberrations from the dominant Protestant model of manhood.
High standards for members.
Membership was limited to "practical" Catholic men or "Catholics in good standing" at the time of their application. Only "worthy" men were permitted to join. As Catholics in parishes that were predominately Irish and Irish-American, the demands placed on them by the church would be well known to them.
Perhaps to counteract the perception of the Irish as drunks or lower class, sobriety was demanded of members. The Order was the only fraternal organization in America at the time whose constitution did not exclude African American members, but "liquor dealers" were expressly prohibited from joining. Newspapers at the time published "sensationalized accounts of inebriated soirees" held by other organizations for Irishmen, but the "Knights' social functions—formal dinners, balls, and cotillions—also reflected members' aspirations toward middle-class refinement."
At the Board of Government convention in 1887, a proposal was made to admit non-Catholics, but was strongly opposed by Supreme Knight John J. Phelan: "The Order cannot stultify itself or allow itself to masquerade in the garb of sanctity it wittingly desecrates. Our laws design us to be Catholics pure and simple."
Growth.
Although its first councils were all in Connecticut, the Order spread throughout New England and the United States in subsequent years. The Order experienced "unparalleled success" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It outpaced all other Catholic fraternities of the era. By 1904, only five states had no council.
By the time of the first annual convention in 1884, the Order was prospering. The five councils throughout Connecticut had a total of 459 members. Groups from other states were requesting information. By 1889, there were 300 councils comprising 40,000 knights. Twenty years later, in 1909, there were 230,000 knights in 1,300 councils. The one millionth member, Ferdinand Foch, joined the order in 1921.
As the order expanded outside of Connecticut, structural changes in the late 1880s and 1890s were instituted to give the Knights a federalist system with local, state, and national branches of government. This allowed them to coordinate activities across states and localities.
The Charter of 1899 included four statements of purpose, including: "To promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper, and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best." The new charter showed members' desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society. Associate members who did not purchase life insurance were permitted to join in 1892.
On September 22, 1934, William Cardinal O'Connell was the first American to be made an honorary member of the Supreme Council. In 1937, Massachusetts State Deputy Patrick J. Moynihan stunned delegates by nominating Deputy Supreme Knight Francis P. Matthews for Supreme Knight, but Matthews declined the nomination.
Outside the United States.
The Knights of Columbus have councils in many countries, including Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam, Saipan, Lithuania, Ukraine, and South Korea. The first councils in Mexico and the Philippines were founded in 1905. Cuba's first council was established in 1909.
Canada.
Canada Council number 284 was established in 1897 in Montreal. It was largely anglophone with only six French Canadian members. Its first Grand Knight, however, was J.J. Guerin, a member of the Quebec Legislature. Archbishop Paul Bruchesi of Montreal and several other bishops initially opposed the Knights' expansion into Canada. Private negotiations with Cardinal James Gibbons assuaged the fears of most.
In Toronto, however, Archbishop Denis T. O'Connor blocked efforts to expand into his archdiocese on the grounds that there were already too many Catholic societies in existence. Upon his retirement in 1908, new Archbishop Fergus McEvay allowed a council to be formed on the condition that he be allowed to appoint the council's chaplain. The 131 charter members swelled to more than 600 in just eight years, and it became the largest council in Ontario with nearly 10% of all knights in the province.
The Knights grew rapidly in Canada, and by 1904 there was a state council in Quebec and one for Ontario and the Maritimes. Six years later, in 1910, the 60 Canadian councils had 9,000 members. While there were other Catholic fraternal societies in Canada in the 19th century, "none recruited as vigorously, grew as rapidly, or captured the public attention and imagination as did the caped and plumed Knights of Columbus." By then, the Knights were seen as "those laymen who could successfully defend the Church from external opposition when required and, more importantly, could voice the opinions and teachings of the Church, bringing them to bear of the problems of Canadian society."
Forty years after its founding, the Knights of Columbus had spread into Canada and had become a powerful enough presence there to generate a backlash from the nationalist francophone community. French Canadians created a competing society, the Ordre de Jacques Cartier, in 1926.
Columbian manhood.
In contrast to most of the other fraternal societies of the era, which provided an escape from the extreme gender bifurcation of the Victorian era, "literature produced by the Knights of Columbus valorized affectionate bonds between men and their mothers, and idealized the relationship between men and their wives and children." The early records of the Order did not display concern about the purported feminization of men that arises from a commitment to family and faith.
Instead, Columbian manhood in the early documents equated manhood with the performance of one's duties as a Catholic and father. It emphasized being chivalrous, a loving husband, a good Catholic, and a solidarity with one's fellow man. Knights were seen as fathers and parishioners first. This sense of duty to faith and family was also reflected in the public events the Order conducted during its first two decades of existence.
The Columbiad, "a monthly paper devoted to the interests of the Knights of Columbus", published an article in November 1903 comparing Knights of Columbus to chivalrous medieval Christian knights, extolling their shared traits of vigorous, virtuous, manly faith. "The Christian Knight," according to The Columbiad, "was the knight of spotless life, of Christian faith, of dauntless courage, of unblemished honor, faithful to his word, loyal and true, like the knights of King Arthur." Both had "manly virtue, valor, humanity, courtesy, justice and honor" and both were called to "rescue the helpless from captivity, to protect the orphans and widows, and assist the sick and poor." Knighthood, in the Columbian model, "valorized individual self-sacrifice for greater social welfare". It gave members "an aristocracy of character".
Columbian men were also expected to take an active role in fatherhood and child rearing. The Columbiad affirmed the role and duty of the father, encouraging men to show affection and to "assist their children intelligently and sympathetically to overcome" faults and character flaws. Men were also expected to have close and supportive relationships with their wives and mothers.
Fourth Degree.
From the earliest days of the Order, members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members; this issue was discussed at the National Meeting of 1899. As early as 1886, Supreme Knight James T. Mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress. From these discussions, the Fourth Degree was created, joining the three previous degrees on charity, unity, and fraternity.
About 1,400 members attended the first exemplification of the Fourth Degree at the Lenox Lyceum in New York on February 22, 1900. The event was infused with Catholic and patriotic symbols, imagery that "celebrated American Catholic heritage". The two knights leading the ceremony, for example, were the Expositor of the Constitution and the Defender of the Faith. The ritual soon spread to other cities. The new Fourth Degree members returned to their councils, forming assemblies composed of members from several councils. Those assemblies chose the new members.
In 1903, the Board of Directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism Order-wide, using the New York City model. The Order had a "desire to receive within its ranks only the best" and intended the men should be practicing Catholics. As one measure, each candidate was required to submit a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received Holy Communion within the past two weeks.
Fourth degree members belong to one of 3,109 assemblies, including 75 created in 2012. The first assembly in Europe was established in 2012, and in 2013 a new assembly for Boston-area college councils was created at Harvard University. there were 335,132 Fourth Degree members, including 15,709 who joined the ranks of the Patriotic Degree the year before.
In its early days, it worked to counter the bias that good Catholics could not be good Americans. The early Fourth Degree ceremony stressed the contributions Catholics from many countries had made to the United States and had Catholic citizenship as its theme.
Color guards.
Assemblies may form color guards, which are often the most visible arm of the Knights. They often attend important civic and church events.
The first Fourth Degree uniform, adopted in 1900, consisted of white ties, top hats and tails. In 1940, the uniform was changed to a plumed chapeau, a tuxedo, a cape and a ceremonial sword. With the 1940 uniform, the Supreme Master wore a dark blue cape and chapeau, a vice supreme master wore a light blue cape and chapeau, a master wore a gold cape and chapeau, a district marshal wore a green cape and chapeau, a faithful navigator wore a white cape and chapeau, an assembly commander wore a purple cape and chapeau, and color corps members wore red capes and white chapeaus.
In 2017, the uniform was modernized to consist of a blue blazer, an official Knights of Columbus tie, and a beret, all of which are embossed with the fourth-degree emblem. Members also wear a white shirt and dark gray slacks. The ceremonial sword was retained.
War efforts.
Cristero War.
Following the Mexican Revolution, the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a ten-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. "Columbia", the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of "Columbia" portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of "The Red Peril of Mexico", the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.
In 1926, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico. The order subsequently launched a $1million campaign to educate Americans about the attacks on Catholics and the church in the Cristero War. The organization produced pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies. So much printed material was smuggled into Mexico that the government directed border guards be aware of women bringing Catholic propaganda into the country hidden in their clothes. Twenty-five martyrs from the conflict would eventually be canonized, including six knights.
Supreme Treasurer Daniel J. Callahan, a well known civic leader in Washington, convinced Senator William E. Borah to launch an investigation in 1935 into human rights violations in Mexico. The order was praised for their efforts by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical, "Iniquis afflictisque".
World War I.
To prove that good Catholics could also be good Americans, and to mitigate some of the American Anti-Catholicism prevalent in the United States at the time, the Knights supported both the war effort and the troops during World WarI. Thousands of knights served in the American Expeditionary Forces, including William T. Fitzsimons, considered the first American officer killed in the war. On April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered the war, the board of directors passed a resolution calling for
the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.
Supreme Knight James A. Flaherty proposed to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The organization already had experience, having provided similar services to troops encamped on the Mexican border during Pershing's expedition of 1916. Staff and chaplains were sent to every Army camp and cantonment.
With the slogan "Everyone Welcome, Everything Free", the "huts" became recreation/service centers for doughboys regardless of race or religion. They were staffed by "secretaries", commonly referred to as "Caseys" (for K of C) who were generally men above the age of military service. The centers provided basic amenities not readily available, such as stationery, hot baths, and religious services. One well-known "Casey" was major league baseball player Johnny Evers of "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance", who traveled to France as a member of the Knights of Columbus to organize baseball games for the troops. A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them. In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris. The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.
To pay for these huts and their staff, the order instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1million. Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14million to support the effort. In 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights and other organizations undertook another effort to raise funds to support the welfare of the men fighting abroad. The amount apportioned to the order and the National Catholic War Council totaled $30million which, when combined with earlier efforts, funded efforts to support troops both in the United States and overseas. After the war, the Knights became involved in education, occupational training, and employment programs for the returning troops.
As a result of their efforts during the war, "the Order was infused with the self-confidence that it could respond with organizational skill and with social and political power to any need of Church and society. In this sense, the K. of C. reflected the passage of American Catholicism from an immigrant Church to a well-established and respected religious denomination which had proven its patriotic loyalty in the acid test of the Great War." The Knights used the legitimacy their war efforts and government partnership provided them to attract millions of new members.
In Canada, the order's charity work a "fusion of Catholicism and Canadian identity among Catholic laymen but [which also] signaled significant changes in Protestant Toronto's acceptance of English-speaking Catholics as loyal citizens." According to Supreme Knight Flaherty, "The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light." Since this time they have been "a leading American association". In fact, the Knights' efforts attracted so much positive publicity that anti-Catholics and opponents of the order began to complain.
After the war, the Knights built a series of playgrounds in Rome for the children of that city, overseen by past Supreme Knight Edward L. Hearn. The work was eventually put to a halt by Benito Mussolini as he wanted the allegiance of the Italian youth for the fascist party.
World War II.
Shortly after the United States entered World War II, the order established a War Activities Committee to keep track of all activities undertaken during the war. They also, in January 1943, established a Peace Program Committee to develop a "program for shaping and educating public opinion to the end that Catholic principles and Catholic philosophy will be properly represented at the peace table at the conclusion of the present war." The committee conferred with scholars, theologians, philosophers, and sociologists and proposed a program adopted at the 1943 Supreme Convention.
Canadian Knights.
Less than two weeks after the outbreak of World War II, on September 13, 1939, Canadian Supreme Director Claude Brown wired each Canadian state deputy to inform them of his plans to establish a welfare program comparable to the "huts" sponsored by the order during World WarI. The Canadian government accepted his proposal by the end of October, and formed a unified organization including the Knights, the YMCA, the Salvation Army, and the Canadian Legion. Between December 1939 and April 1940, the Canadian Knights raised almost $230,000, "an extraordinary amount considering the fact that there were relatively few Knights in Canada."
In large cities, recreation centers were established, and morale programs were run in a number of training camps. Hostels were established for servicemen on furloughs first in Canada, then England, and eventually across Europe. Sporting events were organized, musical and comedy shows were produced, and even academic courses and a library were provided.
Recognizing the danger the volunteers who staffed these camps were undertaking, the Canadian government gave them a stipend equal to that of a captain in the Canadian Army and made them eligible for retirement and disability pay. F. O'Neil, who ran the Knights' recreation center in Hong Kong, was captured by the Japanese and was made a prisoner of war. Six volunteers, including Brown, died during the war.
Canadian Knights, and not the government, provided supplies for Catholic chaplains. Bishop Charles Leo Nelligan of the Military Ordinariate of Canada wrote that 
Supreme Knight Francis Matthews "expressed a feeling of pride" on behalf of the entire order at the Canadian Knights' efforts, and membership in Canada more than doubled between 1939 and 1947.
Conflict with the Ku Klux Klan.
Since its earliest days, the Knights of Columbus has been a "Catholic anti-defamation society". These efforts increased during the 1920s as the Knights, the "pre-eminent Catholic fraternal organization", sought to correct misconceptions about Catholicism.
Not long after the establishment of the Fourth Degree, during the nadir of American race relations, a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth Degree Knights swore to exterminate Freemasons and Protestants. In addition, they purportedly were prepared to flay, burn alive, boil, kill, and otherwise torture anyone, including women and children, when called upon to do so by church authorities. "It is a strange paradox," according to some commentators, that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti-Americanism.
The "bogus oath" was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the Jesuits more than three centuries earlier. The Ku Klux Klan, which was growing into a newly powerful force through the 1920s, spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their contemporary campaign against Catholics (which was part of a campaign against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, of whom many were Catholic). During the 1928 Presidential election, the Klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat Catholic Democratic candidate Al Smith. Thomas S. Butler (R), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, read it into the Congressional Record. The bogus oath was refuted by the Committee of Public Information, a propaganda agency of the U.S. Government established during World WarI.
Misunderstanding Catholicism, the Klan alleged that Knights were only loyal to the Pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the United States government. Across the country, local, state, and the Supreme Councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic. No one could, but that did not stop the Klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies. Numerous state councils and the Supreme Council believed that this "violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives". They believed publication would stop if the KKK were assessed fines or punished by jail time assessed. They began suing distributors for libel. The KKK ended its publication of the false oath. As the Order did not wish to appear motivated by a "vengeful spirit", it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders.
To help combat this misconception, the K of C submitted the actual oath of Fourth Degree members for examination by various groups of prominent non-Catholic men around the country. Many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the Knights. After examining the true oath, a committee of high-ranking California Freemasons, a group identified as a target in the bogus oath, declared in 1914: 
The ceremonial of the Order [of the Knights of Columbus] teaches a high and noble patriotism, instills a love of country, inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the Constitution of our Country as the richest and most precious possession of a Knight of the Order.
In Muncie, Indiana, a local council organized a march of 750 people to protest the KKK.
"Pierce v. Society of Sisters".
After World War I, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about "foreign" values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the Oregon Compulsory Education Act. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. It was promoted by groups such as the Knights of Pythias, the Federation of Patriotic Societies, the Oregon Good Government League, the Orange Order, and the Ku Klux Klan.
The Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by 1926. Roger Nash Baldwin, an associate director of the ACLU and a personal friend of then-Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart, offered to join forces with the Order to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.
The case became known as "Pierce v. Society of Sisters", a seminal United States Supreme Court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best. It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.
Racial integration in the U.S..
To combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities, including Catholics, the Order formed a historical commission which published a series of books on their contributions, among other activities. The "Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series" of books included three titles: "The Gift of Black Folk", by W. E. B. Du Bois, "The Jews in the Making of America" by George Cohen, and "The Germans in the Making of America" by Frederick Schrader.
As the 20th century progressed, some councils in the United States became integrated, but many were not. Given the history of slavery and early development in the U.S., most African Americans were Protestant. But many in former French or Spanish territories had grown up Catholic. Church officials and organizations encouraged integration. By the end of the 1950s, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates. In 1963, Hart attended a special meeting at the White House hosted by President John F. Kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders. A few months later, a local KofC council rejected a black man's application because of his race, notwithstanding that he was a graduate of Notre Dame University. Six council officers resigned in protest, and the incident made national news. Hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next Supreme Convention, but died before he could see it take place.
The 1964 Supreme Convention was scheduled to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days before the Convention, new Supreme Knight John W. McDevitt learned the hotel admitted only white guests, under the state's racial segregation policy. He threatened to move the Convention to another venue. The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The Convention amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme Convention amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.
Recent history.
According to Massimo Faggioli, the Knights of Columbus are "'an extreme version' of a post-VaticanII phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves".
In 1959, Fidel Castro sent an aide to represent him at a Fourth Degree banquet in honor of the Golden Jubilee of the Order's entry into Cuba. Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart attended a banquet in the Cuban Prime Minister's honor in April of that year sponsored by the Overseas Press Club. He later sent him a letter expressing regret that they were not able to meet in person.
Hart visited President and fellow Knight John F. Kennedy at the White House on Columbus Day, 1961. Hart presented Kennedy with a poster of the American flag with the story of how the Order got the words "under God" inserted in the Pledge of Allegiance.
The Order opened a new headquarters in New Haven in 1969. The 321', 23 story building took two years to construct, including 40 days to pour the concrete for the elevator well. Construction cost less than $10million. At the time it was the tallest building in the city, but as of 2018 it was the third tallest.
The ribbon cutting took place during the 87th Supreme Convention where Governor John N. Dempsey and Hartford Archbishop John F. Whealon each spoke and Apostolic Delegate Luigi Raimondi gave a blessing. The architect for the building, which broke ground in 1967, was Kevin Roche. The order's headquarters had been housed, at various times, in five other buildings. The first was in the law offices of Driscol and Asher next to city hall across from New Haven Green.
In each autumn since 1966, the Supreme Council has hosted a College Council Conference at their headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut. The first convention was held at Boston College. As of 2018, there are more than 300 college councils.
As the Order and its charitable works grew, so did its prominence within the Church. The Supreme Board of Directors was invited to hold their April meeting at the Vatican in 1978, and the Board and their wives were received by Pope Paul VI. Pope John Paul I's first audience with a layman was with Supreme Knight Dechant, and Pope John Paul II met with Dechant three days after his installation.
Pope John Paul II traveled to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in 1978, and Dechant was invited to attend and welcome the Pope to the Americas. It was also while there that Dechant was invited to establish the Order in the Dominican Republic. During the pope's 1979 visit to the United States, the Supreme Officers and Board were the only lay organization to receive an audience.
In 1997, the cause for McGivney's canonization was opened in the Archdiocese of Hartford. It was placed before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2000. The Father Michael J. McGivney Guild was formed in 1997 to promote his cause, and it currently has more than 140,000 members. Membership in the Knights of Columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild, nor is membership restricted to Knights; members must elect to join. On March 15, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI approved a decree recognizing McGivney's "heroic virtue", significantly advancing the priest's process toward sainthood. McGivney may now be referred to as the "Venerable Servant of God". If the cause is successful, he would be the first priest born in the United States to be canonized as a saint.
The Knights of Columbus were among the groups that welcomed Pope Benedict XVI on the South Lawn of the White House on April 16, 2008, the pontiff's 81st birthday, during his visit to the U.S. In March 2016 the Knights of Columbus delivered to Secretary of State John Kerry a 280-page report entitled "Genocide Against Christians in the Middle East", which led to the State Department's declaration that "ISIS's systematic massacre of Christians in the Middle East had reached genocidal proportions."
A new Military Overseas Europe Special District for the Fourth Degree was established in 2013. More than a hundred Department of Defense civilian employees and active duty personnel based in Germany, Italy, and Britain took part in a special Fourth Degree Exemplification Ceremony at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany in 2013. In that year exemplifications were also held in Camp Zama, Japan, and Yongsan Garrison in Seoul, Korea, where there are existing assemblies.
In 2017, an IT contractor sued the Knights of Columbus and accused them of breaching a verbal contract. On September 12, 2019, a jury found the Knights had indeed breached its verbal contract with List Interactive and awarded $500,000 in damages. A report on this situation in "The Tablet" cited Pope Francis' teaching on "a poor Church for the poor", and contrasted this teaching to the high salaries given to members of the Knights' Board of Directors, the use of a Washington lobbyist employing the son of the Supreme Knight, and vigorous encouragement of insurance policy sales by the Knights' chief insurance officer.
Supreme Conventions.
President Richard Nixon addressed the Supreme Convention in 1971. President Ronald Reagan spoke in 1982 and 1986 and George W. Bush spoke in 2004. George H.W. Bush spoke as vice president in 1984 and then again as president in 1992. President Bill Clinton sent a videotaped message to the 111th Supreme Convention saying the Order's "contributions to the Catholic Church and to your communities merit our applause".
Insurance program.
The original insurance system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, and when the number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.
The need for a reserve fund for times of epidemic was seen from the earliest days, but it was rejected several times before finally being established in 1892.
Since its first loan to St. Rose Church in Meriden, Connecticut in the late 1890s, the Knights of Columbus have made loans to parishes, dioceses, and other Catholic institutions. By 1954, over $300million had been loaned and the program "never lost one cent of principal or interest".
In the post-World War II era, the interest rates on long-term bonds dipped below levels at which the Order's insurance program could sustain itself, and Supreme Knight Hart moved the order into a more aggressive program of investing in real estate. Under his leadership, the Order established a lease-back investment program in which the Order would buy a piece of property and then lease it back to the original owner "upon terms generally that would bring to our Order a net rental equal to the normal mortgage interest rate".
Late in 1953 it was learned that the land upon which Yankee Stadium was built was for sale. On December 17, 1953, the Order purchased the property for $2.5million and then leased it back for 28 years at $182,000 a year with the option to renew the lease for three additional terms of 15 years at $125,000 a year. In 1971 the City of New York took the land by eminent domain.
Between 1952 and 1962, 18 pieces of land were purchased as part of the lease-back program for a total of $29million. During this time, the amount of money invested in common stock also increased. In 1969, a requirement that all members between 18 and 26 take out insurance was abolished.
Modern program.
The Order offers a modern, professional insurance operation with more than $100billion of life insurance policies in force and $19.8billion in assets , a figure more than double the 2000 levels. Nearly 80,000 life certificates were issued in 2013, almost 30,000 more than the Order's closest competitor, to bring the total to 1.73 million. The program has a $1.8billion surplus.
Over $286 million in death benefits were paid in 2012 and $1.7billion were paid between 2000 and 2010. This is large enough to rank 49th on the A. M. Best list of all life insurance companies in North America. Since the founding of the Order, $3.5billion in death benefits have been paid. Premiums in 2012 were nearly $1.2billion, and dividends paid out totaled more than $274million. Over the same time period, annuity deposits rose 4.2%, compared to an 8% loss for the industry as a whole.
Every day in 2012 more than $10 million was invested, for a total of $2.7billion on the year, and an annual income of $905million. The Order maintains a two prong investment strategy. A company must first be a sound investment before stock in it is purchased, and secondly the company's activities must not conflict with Catholic social teaching. Citing the awards they have won, the Order calls themselves "champions of ethical investing".
The order also provides mortgages to dioceses, parishes, schools, hospitals, seminaries, and religious orders at "very competitive rates" through its ChurchLoan program. The profits are used to pay life insurance claims. An average of $20million in loans are made each year, with an average loan totally $1.8million. By 1954, over $300 million had been loaned and the program "never lost one cent of principal or interest". Over $500million had been loaned by 2008.
Products include permanent and term life insurance, as well as annuities, long term care insurance, and disability insurance. The insurance program is not a separate business offered by the Order to others but is exclusively for the benefit of members and their families. According to the Fortune 1000 list, the Knights of Columbus ranked 880 in total revenue in 2017 and, with more than 1,500 agents, was 925th in size in 2015. All agents are members of the Order.
The Order's insurance program is the most highly rated program in North America. For 40 consecutive years, the Order has received A. M. Best's highest rating, A++. Additionally, the Order is certified by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association for ethical sales practices. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the insurance program's financial strength/credit rating from AAA to AA+ in August 2011 not due to the Order's financial strength, but due to its lowering of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+. Additionally, the insurance program has a low 3.5% lapse rate of the 1.9 million members and their families who are insured.
Awards.
The order sponsors a number of international awards. The first, the "Gaudium et Spes Award", is named after the document from the Second Vatican Council, and is the highest honor bestowed by the order. It "is awarded only in special circumstances and only to individuals of exceptional merit" and comes with an honorarium of $100,000. Since its institution in 1992, it has been awarded only twelve times.
The second highest international award, also given only "when merited", is the "Caritas Award". Named for the theological virtue alternatively translated as either charity or love, it recognizes "extraordinary works of charity and service". The order established the Grand Cross of the Knights of Columbus, but awarded it only to Cristobal Colón y de La Cerda, Duke of Veragua and descendant of Columbus, when he visited the U.S. in 1893.
"Gaudium et Spes Award" winners:
Supreme Conventions.
The Knights of Columbus invites the head of state of every country in which they operate to the annual Supreme Convention. In 1971, President Richard Nixon gave the keynote address at the States Dinner; Secretary of Transportation and Knight John Volpe had arranged this first appearance of a U.S. president at a Supreme Council gathering.
President Ronald Reagan spoke at the Centennial Convention in 1982. Reagan presented the order with a President's Volunteer Action Award at the White House in 1984. President George H. W. Bush appeared in 1992. President Bill Clinton sent a written message while he was in office, and President George W. Bush sent videotaped messages before he attended in person at the 2004 convention. President Barack Obama also sent written messages during his term in office.

1979 UK Athletics Championships

The 1979 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Alexander Stadium, Birmingham.
It was the third edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1979 AAA Championships.
Two athletes claimed a third straight title: Geoff Capes in the men's shot put and Meg Ritchie in the discus throw. Athletes to claim a second consecutive UK title were David Black (10,000 m), Chris Black (hammer throw), David Ottley (javelin throw), and Sue Reeve (long jump). Heather Hunte won her first titles in the 100 metres and 200 metres, beating out Kathy Smallwood and Beverley Goddard in both events.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1979 European Cup. The secondary status of the UK event at national level was indicated by the fact that the six individual medallists at the European competition were all absent from the championships in Birmingham. Several of the European women's relay medallists did compete however, including Hunte, Smallwood and Joslyn Hoyte-Smith.

Antonina Hoffmann

Antonina Hoffmann (16 June 1842 – 16 June 1897) was a Polish theatre actress and leading representative of the so-called 'Kraków School' of acting introduced by . Her acting career spanned five decades during the Victorian era.
Early life.
Antonina Hoffmann was born in Trzebinia, Poland, the daughter of Jan Hoffmann and Emilia (née Thiel), an impoverished landowning evangelical family of German origin. In her youth she attended Paulina Krakow's finishing school for girls in Warsaw. Against the wishes of her family she decided that she wanted to go on the stage; in 1858 she began taking private acting lessons from Jan Królikowski, in the same year becoming a student at Józef Rychter's School of Drama in Warsaw. She made her stage debut aged 17, while still a student, as Fredericka Wagner in Émile Augier and Jules Sandeau's comedy "Touchstone" at the Rozmaitości Theatre in 1859. In 1860 she moved to Kraków, where she was hired by Józef Pfeiffer, director of the Municipal Theatre in Kraków. She went on to make many appearances with that company in performances at Lviv, Poznań, Prague and Warsaw. She was a co-worker and lifelong companion of (this relationship lasted until her death, but it was not formalized in marriage) and became an exponent of his 'Kraków School' of acting, which involved a deeper analysis of the text of the play. She competed successfully for the position of the leading actress in the group of the Kraków theatre with Helena Modjeska.
Career.
Apart from a few short interludes Hoffmann worked exclusively in Kraków until 1893, at first under Pfeiffer's direction and later under that of Adam Miłaszewski (1863–1865), whose period as director ended in fiasco and in the breaking up of the entire company. This resulted in something of a low point in Hoffmann's career. A falling out with Miłaszewski caused her to depart from the Kraków theatre and by 1865 she had joined Konstanty Sulikowski's company in Tarnow. In 1865, Adam Skorupka became head of the Municipal Theatre in Kraków and Koźmian began collaborating with him. Hoffmann returned and was cast in the theatre's productions, performing with the company in Kraków and during guest appearances in Poznań, Krynica, Kielce, Tarnow and Prague. During this period she travelled to Vienna and Paris to observe theatre there.
Later years and death.
During her later years her career diminished while at the same time fighting against the cancer which was to kill her. Hoffmann died in Kraków on her 55th birthday. She was buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery in the family grave of her friend Helena Modjeska and Wendów. In November that year her body was moved to its own grave, which is decorated with a sculpture-bust of the artist by Michał Korpal and an epitaph which states that she devoted 37 years to the Kraków stage.
Roles.
In total, she played nearly 400 theatre roles; among these were Elizabeth in Friedrich Schiller's "Don Carlos" and Lady Milford in the same author's "Love and Intrigue", Beatrice in "Much Ado About Nothing", Catherine in "Taming of the Shrew", Gertrude in "Hamlet", Lady Macbeth in "Macbeth" and Desdemona in "Othello". She also appeared in the title role in Jean Racine's tragedy "Phèdre", played Suzanne in Pierre Beaumarchais's "The Marriage of Figaro" and Camilla in Alfred de Musset's "No Trifling with Love". She was responsible for introducing the dramas of Juliusz Słowacki to the Kraków stage. She played a number of roles from the Polish repertoire, including Clara in Aleksander Fredro's "Śluby panieńskie" ("Maidens' Vows") and Gulda in Joseph Conrad's "Cyganie" ("The Gypsies"). She also appeared in contemporary French dramas, playing, among others, Joanna de Simerose in "L'ami des Femmes" and Severine in "Princess George" by Alexander Dumas, Princess Falconieri in Octave Feuillet's "Dalila" and the title role in Victorien Sardou's "Odette".

National Cutlery Union

The National Cutlery Union was a trade union representing workers involved in the manufacture of cutlery in the United Kingdom, particularly in Sheffield.
The union originated in 1914 when the Table and Butcher Knife Hafters' Trade and Provident Society merged with the Table and Butcher Blade Smithers' Association, forming the Cutlery Union. This initially had 1,072 members, but the figure gradually fell, reaching only 589 members in 1938. That year, it merged with the Amalgamated Scissors Workers Trade, Sick and Funeral Society, and added "National" to its name.
From the start, the union admitted women as members, and about half the women working in cutlery manufacture in Sheffield were said to be members by 1920. However, women were not initially eligible for the union's sickness benefits.
In 1957, the union merged into the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. By this time, the union had about 900 members.
The union's secretary and treasurer was Harold Slack, who also served as a Labour Party member of Sheffield City Council. He was considered for membership of the Design Council, but was ultimately not appointed. Other union officials included Eddie Wood, who in his spare time officiated the 1933 FA Cup Final.

Headstarting

Headstarting is a conservation technique for endangered species, in which young animals are raised artificially and subsequently released into the wild. The technique allows a greater proportion of the young to reach independence, without predation or loss to other natural causes. 
For endangered birds and reptiles, eggs are collected from the wild are hatched using an incubator. For mammals such as Hawaiian monk seals, the young are removed from their mothers after weaning.
The technique was trialled on land-based mammals for the first time in Australia. In the three years prior to May 2021, young bridled nail-tail wallabies were placed in a fenced-off area of area within Avocet Nature Refuge in Queensland. The population, safe from their main predator, feral cats, more than doubled over this period.

Political activity of the Knights of Columbus

The political activity of the Knights of Columbus deals with the involvement of the Roman Catholic fraternal Order to influence public policy to promote its interests.
The Knights of Columbus have taken an active political role even from the early days of its foundation. In the years following the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, the earlier focus on protesting discrimination against Catholics shifted to more activity to promote social issues.
During much of the 20th century and particularly during the period of the Cold War, the Order was active politically in opposing communism and socialism, especially within the United States. However, it was more supportive of trade unionism, the protection of Catholic civil rights, and some efforts to address racism.
More recently it has taken an active conservative stance on social issues and lobbied for conservative political causes - strongly opposing efforts to introduce same-sex marriage, abortion rights, birth control, and loosening controls around divorce. But the Order has also taken an interest in the rights or immigrants and refugees, especially those coming from Catholic-majority countries.
Military engagement.
First World War.
On 14 April 1917, soon after the United States entered World War I, the board of directors for the Knights passed a resolution calling "for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal" of its members as part of the US war effort. The Order subsequently instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of troops fighting in Europe. Local councils also undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million. Canadian knights took up the cause even earlier, reflecting their closer links to Britain.
In 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights joined other organizations in raising funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the US and overseas, which along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million. Staff and Catholic chaplains were sent to all Army camps and cantonments. A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries (of which 1,075 were overseas), staffed them. In Europe, headquarters for the Order were established in London and Paris under the motto "Everyone welcome, everything free." This continued until November 1919, at which point the federal government took over. The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.
According to Supreme Knight Flaherty, the war provided an opportunity to present the Order "in a most favorable light," and to show that Catholics could also be good patriots - avoiding the suspicion that their loyalty lay with the Holy See in Rome.
Cristero War.
Following the Mexican Revolution, the new government introduced a number of anti-clerical measures to reduced the disproportionate influence of the Roman Catholic Church - such statutes were inserted into the national Constitution, beginning a 10-year struggle with Catholic leaders. During this period there were deaths on both sides, including several priests who were also Knights (some later canonised. Leaders of the Order were active in speaking out against the Mexican government. "Columbia", the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime - the November 1926 cover showed some knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of "The Red Peril of Mexico." The Mexican legislature went on to ban both the Order and the magazine.
In 1926, the Massachusetts State Council in the US passed a resolution opposing the actions of the Mexican government. Shortly after, State Deputy Edmund J. Brandon sent a telegram to President Calvin Coolidge and Frank B. Kellogg opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop. That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with Coolidge to share their concerns.
The Order went on to take a role in smuggling into Mexico pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the actions of the government, provoking efforts at the border to stop the flow. Twenty-five people would later be canonized by the Catholic Church, including six Knights. Supreme Treasurer Daniel J. Callahan persuaded Senator William E. Borah to launch an investigation in 1935 into Mexican human rights violations. Pope Pius XI in his encyclical "Iniquis afflictisque" praised the efforts of the knights in their resistance.
Spanish Civil War.
During the Spanish Civil War, the Catholic Church in America supported General Francisco Franco and the other rebels. The Knights, and other Catholic groups, took the same stance. When a group of American intellectuals formed the Board of Guardians for Basque Refugee Children and proposed shipping children from Spain to the United States, the Knights with others opposed the plan. They appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to keep the children with their families in France, though they were ready to assist those coming to the United States.
The Knights supported the embargo on all arms into Spain, and appealed to Will H. Hays, chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, to ban or label as propaganda (pro-Marxist and anti-Catholic) loyalist films.
World War II.
Shortly after entering the Second World War, the order established a War Activities Committee to keep track of all activities undertaken during the war. They also, in January 1943, established a Peace Program Committee to develop a "program for shaping and educating public opinion to the end that Catholic principles and Catholic philosophy will be properly represented at the peace table at the conclusion of the present war." The committee conferred with scholars, theologians, philosophers, and sociologists and proposed a program adopted at the 1943 Supreme Convention.
Cold War.
During the Cold War, the foreign policy of the United States and the Knights' promotion of Catholic Social Teaching frequently intersected. The Knights urged the UN to restrain the Soviet Union during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.
In the 1950s, The Knights successfully lobbied President Eisenhower to not invite Josip Broz Tito, leader of Yugoslavia, to visit the United States, in view of his jailing of Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac.
At the 1953 Supreme Convention, the delegates adopted a resolution calling for a united Ireland. The Supreme Council adopted a resolution in 1969 endorsing the aims and justice of the Vietnam War, but as the war progressed "Columbia" magazine began to question the effectiveness of the United States' military effort. In Massachusetts, the State Council passed resolutions in the early 1960s calling on the Catholic Church to prevent the spread of communism in Latin America and opposing communist China from joining the United Nations.
Middle East.
During the Syrian and Iraqi Civil Wars, the Knights lobbied Congress to provide humanitarian relief to persecuted Christians and victims of genocide under the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and to declare the atrocities a genocide. 
Testimony provided by Supreme Knight Anderson before Congress in 2016 formed the "blueprint" for the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act of 2018.
Between 2014 and 2017, the Knights' Refugee Relief Fund gave over $20 million for humanitarian relief work in the area. That includes $2 million to rebuild the primarily Christian town of Karamles in Iraq. Such efforts of the Knights have been recognized by church and civil leaders.
Exhibits and media.
Shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Knights' museum showcased Vatican artifacts highlighting the efforts of Pope John Paul II for world peace. The order also produced the 2018 film, "John Paul II in Ireland: A Plea for Peace".
Trade union support, and anti-communism.
In 1914, in line with the encyclical "Rerum Novarum" of Leo XIII, the Knights sponsored free lectures in North America in support of trade unions, reaching some 2,000,000 people.
After the second world war they directed their efforts to align with the threat of communism then prevalent in the United States. In December 1946, they launched a "Crusade for the Preservation and Promotion of American Ideals" that drew an endorsement from President Truman. This formed just a part of the larger Catholic anti-communist effort and would lead to the establishment of discussion groups in over 1,300 local councils. In 1947 they initiated a "Safeguards" series on several hundred radio stations, explaining "the harshness of life in Communist Russia". They also took out advertisements in newspapers promoting Fulton Sheen's book "Communism and the Conscience of the West". However, the Crusade also listed 10 "Abuses of Unrestrained Capitalism." and promoted the rights "to a job, to a family living wage, to collective bargaining and to strike".
Political action in relation to social issues.
Opposition to same-sex marriage.
As part of their public policy efforts, the Knights of Columbus promotes the Catholic view of marriage as a "lifelong union of one man and one woman", which excludes people of the same gender. Since 2005, the Knights have given at least $14 million to legally retain this definition in the United States, specifically to exclude its extension to gay couples. In 2008, they were the largest single donor in support of California's Proposition 8. In 2012, the Knights and its local councils contributed $1 million to support similar ballot campaigns to effectively block same-sex marriage in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. In Massachusetts it led the drive to collect the 170,000 petition signatures to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to include this definition. Likewise in Canada, in 2005 it attempted to stop the Canadian parliament from legalizing same-sex marriage with the "Civil Marriage Act", the order funded a campaign that included 800,000 postcards encouraging members of parliament to reject the measure.
However, the Order did issue a resolution calling for national healing and reconciliation after the terrorist attack at the Florida gay nightclub, Pulse, as well as after the 2015 San Bernardino attack.
Opposition to divorce.
The order also supports the church's teaching on divorce, and the Supreme Council gave their "strong support" to a 1976 address by Bishop Daniel A. Cronin in which he denounced the "increasing practice" of divorce. The Order has a number of initiatives to support and strengthen families as part of their Building the Domestic Church program. The promotion of fatherhood and marital harmony dates back to the founding era of the order.
Opposition to abortion.
The Order has been active in opposing any government action or legislation that extends abortion rights, making clear that those "who do not support the legal protection of unborn children" cannot be invited to events, or have honors bestowed upon them. Additionally the Order has donated significant funds to causes that limit abortion. For example, as part of their Ultrasound Initiative in the US and Canada, 1,000 ultrasound machines were donated to pregnancy centers between 2009 and 2018, This was done on the basis of research that suggested women would subsequently be less willing to go through with an abortion if they had seen ultrasound images, particularly as part of foetal development. The Order also supports women in "crisis pregnancies" with adoption.
Protection of civil rights for Catholics and other minorities.
Up until the First World War, the Order were active to reassure that Catholic immigrants to the US could nevertheless be loyal to their new home, and would opposed restrictions to immigration throughout the middle of the 20th century 
During the 1920s, the state councils initiated letter-writing campaigns and established lobbyists in state capitals and in Washington, D.C., to protect the civil rights of all Catholics within the United States.
In 1921, Edward F. McSweeney, set up the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to more clearly present the role of Catholic immigrants in particular in the founding and history of the United States. James Malone, then Kansas State Deputy, argued that those who claimed that immigrants and Catholics were inferior to native-born Americans and protestants were "bigots".
Immigrants and refugees.
In the years prior to World War I, Canadian Knights established an immigrant aid bureau. After the war, and with the Catholic Women's League, they promoted a "Canadianization of the Newcomer" program. The Knights have also promoted the idea that being a good Catholic can be reconciled with being a good Canadian, and have helped Catholic immigrants assimilate into wider society.
At the request of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, Supreme Knight Martin Carmody wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938 to support Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Palestine.
During the 2008 International Eucharistic Congress, a donation was made by the Order in Canada to Marc Ouellet's foundation to support long-term programs to aid immigrants and refugees.
At the 129th Supreme Convention in 2011, José Gómez criticized the United States' immigration policy as not being "worthy of our national character," and told the delegates to approach the immigration issue as Catholics, not through political affiliation. In 2013, Gustavo Garcia-Siller called on the Knights to bring the light of the Gospel to the "desolate places" which he argued included immigrant detention centers. William Lori noted that the mission in regards to immigration was growing, and cited the involvement in the 2012 "Ecclesia en America" summit as way to "protect, love and help immigrants".
In 2016 the Knights provided funding to the dioceses of Ciudad Juárez and El Paso to facilitate Pope Francis' visit to the US-Mexican border which highlighted the plight of migrants from majority-Catholic Mexico, and the need therefore to work for "just immigration laws."
The Order has also supported the creation of by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church of an Arab Christian Council within Canada as adding "new meaning to the international fraternal organization’s outreach and support of immigrant communities." The council is largely made up of first-generation Canadians from Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Iraq.
The Order has also set up councils to support immigrant communities in Miami for Cuban exiles, a Ukrainian council, and a Vietnamese council in Toronto.
Engagement against racial discrimination.
During the First World War, the Order set up a series of "huts" to free offer rest and recreational facilities for Allied servicemen, African-American soldiers were permitted to use these, in contrast to other areas of American society where segregation was common. During the 1960s, in line with the wider US Civil Rights Movement steps were taken to reduce racial discrimination both within the Order itself as well as wider society. The Order had an influential advocate in President John F. Kennedy, who was himself a member. More recently, in 2017 Supreme Knight Anderson co-authored a piece in "Time" with Eugene Rivers calling on Americans to adopt Martin Luther King Jr.'s principles of non-violence in a time of rising racial tensions in the United States.
Resolutions.
On 9 April 2006 the board of directors commented on the "U.S. immigration policy [which] has become an intensely debated and divisive issue on both sides of the border between the U.S. and Mexico." They called
At the 136th Supreme Convention in 2018, the order adopted a resolution criticizing the Trump administration family separation policy. The Supreme Council called on the administration to "equitably balance the legitimate rights of persons to emigrate in order to seek better lives for themselves and their children, with the duty of governments to control migration into their countries so that immigration policy serves the common good."
Engagement within the United States.
During the early part of the 20th century, both the Supreme and local councils found themselves in agreement with the principles of the Progressive movement. Senator Albert J. Beveridge, an intellectual leader of the Progressive movement, was the featured speaker at "a grand patriotic demonstration" at Carnegie Hall in 1906, and James C. Monaghan, the Supreme Lecturer, frequently spoke out in favor of progressive causes in "Columbiad" and elsewhere. The Massachusetts State Council was supportive of New Deal policies in 1933.
In the 1980s, the Knights supported an amendment to the United States Constitution permitting prayer in public school. 
When president Ronald Reagan attempted to tax fraternal insurance companies such as the Knights of Columbus, then–Supreme Knight Virgil Dechant used White House connections to scuttle the effort. In addition, local councils set up phone banks and letter writing campaigns to oppose the measure, which would have diminished the Knights' ability to make charitable contributions.
Pledge of Allegiance.
The Order played a role in the early stages of the movement that eventually led to the decision by the US Congress to add the phrase "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954. Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was actually the first to suggest this addition and it was used in the 1940s at meetings of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution However, the Knights also adopted the practice following the Fourth Degree Assemblies in April 1951. Though the words had not yet officially been added nationally, the order added the phrase to their recitations, the first group to voluntarily do so on a regular basis. Doing so, the Order believed, would acknowledge "the dependence of our Nation and its people upon the Creator of the Universe." The Knights forwarded a resolution advocating for the addition to New York Congressman Edmund Radwan, and Radwan entered it into the Congressional Record on 25 March 1953. 
The Presbyterian minister, George MacPherson Docherty, was nevertheless the instrumental figure in getting Congress ultimately to act – giving a sermon in 1954 which captured the political attention of President Dwight Eisenhower. But it was Rep. Charles Oakman (R-Mich.), who introduced a bill into Congress in 1954. After signing the change into law, Eisenhower nevertheless wrote to Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart thanking the Knights for their part. In 2014 when the American Humanist Association sued to reverse the decision, lawyers from the Knights and other organizations successfully supported schools that used the phrase in the pledge.
Promotion of Christopher Columbus.
At the behest of the Knights, the US Congress appropriated $100,000 to construct the Columbus Fountain in front of Union Station in Washington, DC, in 1912. Similar lobbying convinced many state legislatures to adopt 12 October as Columbus Day, confirmed by President F. D. Roosevelt as a federal holiday in 1937.
Confirmation hearings of Brian Buescher.
In October 2018, then President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate longtime Knights' member Brian Buescher, to be a Federal Judge on the U.S. District Court. During Buescher's confirmation hearing in December, Senator Mazie Hirono raised concerns about the position of the Knights around social issues, describing them as "extreme", and asked Buescher directly if he intended to end his membership "to avoid any appearance of bias." Senator Kamala Harris likewise raised concerns that the beliefs of the Knights would influence Buescher's legal pronouncements in a conservative direction. Buescher clarified that he was only eighteen when he had joined.
Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin argued that these questions amounted to a "religious test" which is precluded by the US Constitution, and set a "troubling precedent of intolerance...for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service".
In February 2019, Buescher's nomination was narrowly confirmed by the Senate. 
Other countries.
In Canada, by 1910 the Knights were seen as "those laymen who could successfully defend the Church from external opposition when required and, more importantly, could voice the opinions and teachings of the Church, bringing them to bear of the problems of Canadian society." Toronto Council 1388 established a public affairs committee in 1912 that was mandated to increase the interest of Catholics in public affairs and to promote their participation in political life. In the Philippines, local Knights campaigned against government sponsored birth control and condom advocacy.

JB the First Lady

Jerilynn Snuxyaltwa Webster, known by her stage name JB the First Lady (born 1984) is an Indigenous hip-hop and spoken word artist, emcee, beat-boxer, activist, cultural dancer, and youth educator from the Nuxalk and Onondaga nations. She is currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. JB sees her music as a way of capturing oral history and often writes lyrics about challenging subjects such as the Canadian Indian residential school system and missing and murdered Indigenous women. She sees hip-hop as a tool of Indigenous empowerment and is a prominent voice for decolonization and for inspiring Indigenous women and youth.
Early life.
Webster was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan on March 12, 1984. She spent her childhood moving around Canada, and by the time she was a teenager she had lived in many different cities and communities across the country. Webster moved to Vancouver in the early 2000s where she attended her first hip-hop show by Tribal Wisdom, a group of young Indigenous rappers. The show was a pivotal moment for Webster in her journey as a hip-hop artist that inspired her to create music that would empower other young people. In an interview with CBC Music in 2014, she said: "When I went to this hip-hop show, I saw Kinnie Starr and Skeena Reece, Ostwelve, Manik1derful, and they just had so much pride about who they were and where they came from. I wanted to encourage other young people to stand up for the injustices in Canada pertaining to land, water, Aboriginal rights."
Webster then began spending time at the Knowledgeable Aboriginal Youth Association (KAYA) in Vancouver where she had free access to a recording studio and began putting out mixtapes. She began working at KAYA and became executive director of the organization at age 22.
Career.
In 2006, Webster helped found the First Ladies Crew, an Indigenous women's rap and hip-hop collective based out of East Vancouver that features Rapsure Risin, Dani and Lizzy, Christie Lee Charles, and Mama Es. The First Ladies Crew uses hip-hop as a platform to empower young Indigenous women and bring light to oral histories and questions of identity. "Our ancestors, the matriarchs, were the speakers, the keepers of ceremony, and our oral history," said Webster. "As a young person, an activist talking about women’s rights or about murdered and missing Indigenous women, hip-hop has been the best venue to connect with not only my peers and young people, but also the greater public that may have barriers to listening to the stories of First Nations and Indigenous people."
With four solo and one collaborative album out, Webster is a strong, consistent voice in Indigenous hip-hop and activism. She is well known for her involvement in the Idle No More movement and for emceeing rallies for Indigenous rights, decolonization, environmental justice, and the issue of violence against Indigenous women. In February 2017, Webster was a panelist for a national forum on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Girls hosted by Anna Maria Tremonti for CBC's The Current. Webster has performed, spoken, and facilitated music events at hundreds of venues across Canada, including youth and community centers in Indigenous communities, at political rallies, and in schools. Since the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report, Webster has also regularly spoken about Indigenous knowledge and histories with immigrant, refugee, and non-Indigenous communities and groups such as the B.C. Nurses' Union and the Hospital Employees’ Union. Despite national recognition, Webster maintains a strong focus on supporting and giving back to the youth in her community.
