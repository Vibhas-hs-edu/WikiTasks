Darius Leonard

Darius Shaquille Leonard (born July 27, 1995) is an American football Outside linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the South Carolina State Bulldogs and was drafted in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft by the Colts. In his rookie season, Leonard led the league in tackles and was named a First-Team All-Pro and Defensive Rookie of the Year; he was also voted into the NFL Top 100 the following offseason. Leonard has been informally nicknamed "Maniac" due to his energetic and productive on-field play.
Early years.
Leonard attended and played high school football at Lake View High School in Lake View, South Carolina.
College career.
Leonard led SCSU in tackles as a redshirt freshman in 2014, compiling 86, 14 for loss, five sacks, and two forced fumbles. He posted 70 stops the following year (2015), 13 of those for loss, with five sacks and two interceptions to earn a first-team all-conference selection as a redshirt sophomore. After the 2016 season, Leonard was named the MEAC defensive player of the year, making SC State the first school to win the award four years in a row. Leonard finished the season with 124 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 3 sacks, two interceptions, three pass break-ups, and four forced fumbles. He had an impressive game against ACC powerhouse Clemson, totaling 19 tackles. Leonard saved his best for last, as he posted career highs in total tackles (113) and sacks (8) as a senior while picking off two more passes and forcing one fumble. His 73 solo tackles in 2017 put him in the Top 10 in the nation, and 4 of his sacks came in his final two games. He also won the MEAC defensive player of the year award again after the 2017 season.
Professional career.

Leonard attended the NFL Scouting Combine, but was unable to complete all of his combine drills after injuring his quadriceps while running his 40-yard dash. He completed the bench press, 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash at the NFL Combine. On March 20, 2018, Leonard participated at South Carolina State's pro day and performed the rest of his combine drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Leonard was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts.

Hugo Pos

Hugo Pos (November 28, 1913 in Paramaribo – November 11, 2000 in Amsterdam) was a Surinamese judge, writer, and poet.
Biography.
Hugo Pos was born in Paramaribo. In 1925, he left Suriname for the Netherlands to study at the grammar school and later Leiden University, and continued his studies in Paris. In 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and because Pos was Jewish, he tried to escape. His second attempt was successful and Pos managed to reach California via Finland, Russia and Japan. He then decided to go to the United Kingdom to enlist in the army. In 1944, Pos joined the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, and prosecuted "minor war crimes" for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Japan. Pos was back in the Netherlands in 1948, however he decided to return to his native country of Suriname in 1950 where he was appointed as judge and attorney general. Pos also taught at the Law School in Paramaribo. Eddy Hoost, the first Minister of Justice of an independent Suriname, asked Pos to return to Suriname to head the Constitutional Court of Suriname. Pos accepted the offer, however the court was not established until 4 October 2019. Pos started to publish under his own name after his retirement .
Writer and Poet.
He wrote poems under the pseudonym "Ernesto Albin" in the magazine "Soela" (1963-1964) and a number of plays, including the self-directed "Vive la Vida" (1957) and radio play "Black and White". He published several collections of quatrains, which were later collected in "Een uitroep zonder uitroepteken"' ("an exclamation without exclamation mark") (1987) and various other collections.
In his 1982 play "De Tranen van Den Uyl" (English: "The Tears of Den Uyl"), Pos writes about the December murders. Harold Riedewald, and Eddy Hoost were not just former students of Pos during the time he was teaching at the Law School in Suriname, but also personal friends. The play is about a fictitious meeting between the Surinamese reporter Jozef Slagveer and his Dutch counterpart Han de Graaf, in which the events after the independence of Suriname are discussed. Pos did not write the play as a drama, but as a means of remembrance. Even though he lived in diaspora, he mentally remained in his land of birth.
In his first collection of stories "Het doosje van Toeti" ("The box of Toeti") (1985), he looks back on his childhood years in Paramaribo and his crossing to Holland. The stories from his second collection, "De ziekte van Anna Printemps" ("The Disease of Anna Printemps") (1987) take place everywhere around the globe. This cosmopolitanism can also be found in the collection of essays and travel reports that appeared on the occasion of his 74th birthday, "Reizen en stilstaan" ("Travel and residence") (1988), in which he also reflects on the moral implications of the judgments he had to express as a representative of the colonial authority over colonized people.

Sah Mal

Sah Mal (also known as Shah Mal Singh) (1797 — 18 July 1857) was a rebel at the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, based out of the village of Bijrol, Uttar Pradesh. He led the Jats of Baraut in rebellion against the East India Company.
In June 1857, Sah Mal Singh seized 500 head of cattle, and collected escaped convicts and other locals and formed a force. On 18 July, British forces came under attack as they approached the village of Baraut. A group of fighters led by Sah Mal took up positions in a nearby orchard, and came under pressed attack by a Rifles unit. The Jat formation broke, and were attacked on the flank by mounted troops. Hand-to-hand combat ensued, during which Sah Mal was killed.

Ted Newman (singer)

Ted Newman (born May 6, 1939) is an American singer, guitarist, songwriter, teacher, and cowboy poet. In 1957, his single “Plaything” was released on Rev Records and reached No. 45 on the Billboard Top 100. The same year he made two appearances on Dick Clark's "American Bandstand". In January, 2009 The Associated Press selected Newman's poem "Plea to the Pres" as a winner in their poetry contest regarding the inauguration of President Barack Obama. In 2012, the Arizona Historical Society named him as one of 100 Arizona Culture Keepers for the Arizona Centennial celebration.
Early life.
Newman was born in South Dakota, spent much of his childhood in Wyoming, and then moved to Arizona. He attended Holbrook High School for three years and then moved to Phoenix, Arizona where he attended North Phoenix High School. He played quarterback at Holbrook, and was a celebrated fullback for North Phoenix High. He also performed and sang baritone solos for his high school's A Cappella Choir. In 1957, The Arizona Republic reported that he was voted Most Outstanding Senior (male) at his high school.
Recording success.
While still in high school, Newman got his start in the music business recording a few jingles for local commercials. During his senior year he recorded the single "Plaything" (written by Henry and Samuel Underwood) b/w "Unlucky Me" (written by Connie Conway) with Rev Records at Ramsey's Recording Studio (later Audio Recorders). The single sold 20,000 copies in the first ten days. After two and a half weeks it sold 100,000 copies, and eventually over 250,000 copies were purchased. In 1957, "Plaything" peaked at No. 45 on the Billboard Top 100. Building on his chart success, Newman performed on Dick Clark's "American Bandstand", the "Guy Mitchell Show", and "The Milt Grant Show". He also opened for Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins on a six-week tour of Texas. His follow up album with Rev Records, "I Double Dare You" was considered a "flop". He later recorded "Why Did You Break My Heart?" b/w "It's Hot in Here" and "Brigette" b/w 'Hey Little Freshman" with RCA Victor.
College.
Newman attended Arizona State University (ASU) on a football scholarship, but the NCAA prohibited student athletes on scholarships from collecting income from outside sources. Due to the success of "Plaything", he was already making money with his music. For this reason, and a knee injury, Newman chose to stop playing football and pursue his music career.
While at ASU, Newman was part of a folk-song trio, the Balladeers, with fellow singers John Southern and Toby Constance.
In 1960, Newman and two fellow ASU students decided to tour the world with their stringed instruments. Newman sold one of his guitars and an amplifier to help fund their six-month trip. Newman played guitar, John Southern played the banjo, and Ron Iverson provided vocals. They started out with $160 cash and paid for their rest of their travel expenses by performing and finding money-making opportunities along the way. While in Spain, he recorded an album which made 17,400 pesetas, which was equal to about . He also spent a week working as a coal miner in Cologne, Germany.
During Christmas break, Newman worked at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel as a host taking care of children and teens whose parents were vacationing there. He took them on desert picnics, swimming parties, and other events.
Career.
Performing music.
For several years, Ted Newman performed regularly at the Ramada Inn and The Other Place restaurant, both in Scottsdale, Arizona.
In 1993 he recorded a new album of his original songs entitled "Where Does Love Go?" The album was arranged and produced by guitarist Billy Williams (who also worked with Lyle Lovett, Wanda Jackson, Mel Tillis) and recorded by Grammy Award winning recording engineer, Jack Miller, at Jack Miller Productions in Phoenix.
In 1996, he got together with Al Casey and Del Shannon to perform as the Ted Newman Trio. For a while, they performed every Thursday night at Monti's at the Ranch, in Mesa, Arizona.
Military.
Newman flew a helicopter for ten years in the Air National Guard, and was a Captain in the U.S Army Reserve at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Arizona. He has toured veterans hospitals on many occasions to sing and perform for the hospitalized veterans.
Teacher.
While working on his teaching credential from New Mexico State University, he worked a variety of odd jobs including teaching ballroom dancing, running a chili plant, and managing a K-Mart. He worked for six years at a grade school in Deming, New Mexico, and then worked for many more years at Nevitt Elementary School, and later at Aguilar Elementary School in the Tempe Elementary School District. He used his music in the classroom as a teaching tool and wrote songs about the vulnerable childhood years, including warning against drug use and self-pity. He also wrote songs about academic subjects.
Poet and songwriter.
Newman has written over 500 songs and poems. One of Newman's songs "The Great Sonoran Desert" has been illustrated and made into a children's book. He also created and performed "The Great Sonoran Desert Critter Show" in which he gave children an educational presentation about desert animals.
In January 2009, The Associated Press selected Newman's poem "Plea to the Pres" and nine other poems as winners in their poetry contest which asked for entries about the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Newman used the opportunity to ask President Obama to "be the President our country needs." One of his poems, a tribute to actor Ben Johnson, titled "Ben Johnson Evening Star", which he co-wrote with historian Marshall Trimble, was printed in "American Cowboy" "Magazine" and "True West Magazine".
Newman wrote 18 original songs for a musical play, "The Lost Dutchman," about the Superstition Mountains legend of the Lost Dutchman gold mine. The Arizona Musical Theatre Institute presented the musical in January 2001.
His song "Those Who Served So Well" written for fallen police officers, has been shared with police departments across the country.
Ranch hand.
He has spent many summers working in Colorado as a wrangler, guide, and entertainer for special events.
Awards and legacy.
In 2012, the Arizona Historical Society named him as one of 100 Arizona Culture Keepers for the Arizona Centennial.
TV song placements.
Two of Newman's Rev Records recordings, "Plaything" and "None of Your Tears" have been licensed by Fervor Records to television shows. His song "None of Your Tears" was played on episode 110 of the show "Killing Kennedy", on the National Geographic channel. His song, "Plaything" was played on episode 205 of the show "Wynonna Earp" on the SyFy channel.

Sophie Thalbitzer

Sophie Thalbitzer (née Zinn, 15 April 1774 – 27 December 1851) was a Danish memoirist known for "Grandma's Confessions" (), which offers a rare first-hand account of everyday life for a child and young woman in an upper-class bourgeois family in Copenhagen during the late 18th and early 19th century. She was a daughter of the wealthy merchant Johann Ludvig Zinn and grew up in the Zinn House at Kvæsthusgade 3. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959.
Biography.
Sophie Dorothea Zinn was born into a wealthy merchant family in Copenhagen, the daughter of Johann Ludvig Zinn and his wife. She was a keen reader and was particularly struck by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "Confessions".
One of her father's business partners, Hinrich Ladiges, a wealthy sugar manufacturer who was 40 years her senior, proposed to her when she was 17 years old. Her father was strongly in favour of the liaison but she declined. She later married Henry Thalbitzer (1767–1818) who was Royal Prussian consul to Helsingør. She was widowed in 1818.
"Grandma's Confessions".
She wrote her memoirs after she became a widow at the age of 41. They were originally intended for their son Carl Wilhelm Thalbitzer (Billy) but later published under the name "Grandmama's Bekiendelser". They offer a first-hand account of everyday life as a child and young woman in an upper-class environment in Copenhagen during the late 18th and early 19th century.

Irlam (1813 ship)

Irlam was a West Indiaman launched in Liverpool in 1813 for Barton &amp; Co., which had lost an earlier in 1812. The current "Irlam" was of the same burthen as her predecessor, and was employed in the same trade, Liverpool to Barbados. She was wrecked in January 1824.
Career.
"Irlam" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1813 with Rodger Hall, master, Barton and Company who were the owners, and traded from Liverpool to Barbados. She had entered service by June. The ship was fitted with a "Liverpool Patent Binnacle and Compass" manufactured by Egerton, Smith &amp; Co Ltd, Liverpool.
Departing from Barbados in December 1814 in a convoy of 44 ships escorted by , , and , she arrived at Cobh, County Cork on 26 January 1815, after a voyage of 40 days. She was carrying a cargo of coffee and sugar. On 9 December 1816 "Irlam", Irlam master, arrived at Liverpool from Barbados. As she was coming up to dock for repairs she struck the pier and her anchor drove through her bows with the result that she ended up with four feet of water in her hold. 
"Irlam" having returned from another voyage from Barbados was driven ashore on 6 July 1817 at Liverpool. In April/May 1819, "Irlam" sailed from Barbados to Liverpool in 30 days.
Loss.
"Irlam" under Master Higgins was wrecked on 22 January 1824 on the Blackwater Bank, in the Irish Sea off the coast of County Wexford. Her passengers and crew were rescued. She was on a voyage from Liverpool to Barbados. The announcement of her loss stated that "should the weather prove favourable, the Ships materials may be saved".
Post script.
Barton &amp; Co. promptly proceeded to launch a third , which sailed on the same route and which met with a similar fate, being wrecked in a hurricane at Barbados on 11 August 1831.

Ponce Candy Industries

Ponce Candy Industries was a multi-national manufacturer of confectionary sweets based in Ponce, Puerto Rico, best known for its "Fiesta" brand of candy products. The company was founded in 1940 by Juan Eugenio Mayoral Renovales, Jorge Martín and Rafael Pou. It later expanded into Venezuela in 1946 as "Fiesta C.A.", and into Spain in 1965 as Fiesta Colombina S.L.U. The company's Ponce facility closed in 2002, but continued operating in Spain. The company's last remaining manufacturing plant in Spain became insolvent on 22 September 2014, and went into liquidation, seeking a buyer. The company's 1940s Art Deco building on PR-1 in Barrio Sabanetas in Ponce is now owned by Caribbean University who, in 2002 and in coordination with the Ponce Municipal Government, had plans to convert the facility into a candy museum.
History.
The company was founded in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1940. It made candy from sugar obtained from sugar cane at the nearby Central Mercedita, also in Ponce. In the 1950s, a marketing company proposes the name "Fiesta" to the Ponce Candy management and Ponce Candy industries starts manufacturing its products under that name. At the same time, the company opens operations in Venezuela under the name "Fiesta C.A.". The same year, the company started manufacturing lollipops. In 1965 the company opens operations in Madrid at Alcalá de Henares, as "Fiesta, S.A.". In the 1970s the company experimented with a new lollipop that had candy stuffed with bubble gum and started marketing them in Spain. It named this bubble gum-stuffed lollipop "Kojak", after the movie character. It became a huge success. It would eventually be manufactured in Ponce and Venezuela under the Fiesta name. The bubble gum-filled lollipop began to be manufactured in Puerto Rico by for the prestigious U.S. based Charms Company. In 1984, the "Fresquito" made its debut. It consisted of a candy on a stick sprinkled with hot flavoring.
Company profile.
The company had over 300 employees in Ponce, and more than 130 in Spain. The company manufactured in Puerto Rico, Spain, and Venezuela, but sold in those as well as other countries, including United Kingdom and The United States. In Spain alone, the company had a distribution network with over 40,000 retail outlets. In 2014, the company had a sales portfolio of 18.8 million euros.
Liquidation.
The 2014 sale of the company sought to execute two sales: on for the company itself (products, brand names, distribution network, manufacturing and production rights, etc.) and the physical facilities consisting of 26,800 m2 of space. The first was valued at 12 million euros and the later at 6.7 million euros. Over 50 companies have shown interest in the sale, including some with the backing of KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young. In a "first-of-its-kind", the sale is being done via online purchase proposals; the court-appointed liquidator assures this provides transparency and fairness.
Popular culture.
Fiesta jelly beans and sticky swirl candies were used in scenes of the extraterrestrial TV series "V".

Guardians of Religion Organization

The Guardians of Religion Organization ( "Tanẓīm Ḥurrās ad-Dīn") is an armed insurgent group affiliated with Al-Qaeda and fighting in the Syrian Civil War. The head of the group, Abu Humam al-Shami, was formerly a member of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and previously the al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's branch in Syria between 2013 and 2016. Abu Jilibib Tubasi and Abu Khadija al-Urduni, members of the Guardians of Religion's shura council, left Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in 2016 due to its reported disassociation from al-Qaeda. Tubasi, al-Shami, and Sami al-Oraydi were arrested by HTS in November 2017, in an attempt to stave off the formation of another al-Qaeda affiliated group in Syria. Also, in November 2017, Jaysh al-Badia and Jaysh al-Malahim were formed. The group also rejects infighting against other groups, but has had some tensions with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on a few occasions, most recently from 17 June to 26 June 2020.
History.
In February 2018, the group stated that it is opposed to the fighting between the Syrian Liberation Front and Tahrir al-Sham. However Jaysh al-Sahel, which is part of the Guardians of Religion Organization said that it will fight the SLF if the towns of Muhambal, Bisanqul, and Kafr Shalaya are attacked.
On 26 April 2018, the Guardians of Religion Organization, along with Ansar al-Tawhid, and Jaysh al-Izza, launched a joint attack against Syrian Government forces in the northern countryside of the Hama Governorate.
On 12 October 2018, the Russian government's reconciliation center in Syria accused the group of hoarding materials needed to develop chemical weapons for a false flag attack as well as being an ISIL affiliate. Along with Russian officials accusing the group of being an ISIL affiliate Iraqi media has claimed the group is also an ISIL affiliate operating along the Syrian-Iraqi border, however the group's base of operations is in the Idlib governorate of Syria, the group has not claimed any attacks outside the region nor have any other reports of activity outside of Syria been reported.
On 15 October 2018, the group published a video filmed in Saraqib which showed the group's religious police, the hisbah, driving around the city with loudspeakers calling on people to adhere to sharia.
On 29 December 2018, one of the group's founders, named Abu Julaybib, was killed by government forces in the Daraa Governorate while preparing to establish an insurgent cell linked to the group in southern Syria.
On 30 June 2019, in a rare operation against non-ISIL elements, the U.S. carried out a strike against an al-Qaeda in Syria (AQ-S) leadership meeting at a training facility west of Aleppo, which killed eight jihadists from the Guardians of Religion Organization, including six commanders: two Tunisians, two Algerians, an Egyptian and a Syrian. It was the first known U.S. strike in western Syria since February 2017 due to the U.S. and Russia arranging an unofficial deconfliction boundary that largely bars any substantial U.S. forces from venturing into the region. The U.S. did not specify what assets were used in the strike.
On 31 August 2019, the U.S. carried out a series of airstrikes on a Rouse the Believers Operations Room meeting between Kafriya and Maarrat Misrin, killing over 40 Guardians of Religion militants, including several leaders.
On 27 October 2019, members of the group were killed during a US raid targeting ISIL's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Barisha. A commander of the group named Abu Muhammad al-Halabi, the owner of the house Baghdadi was staying at, was killed during the raid. An Iraqi intelligence official and Hisham al-Hashimi have stated to "The Independent" that Halabi was also a smuggler, which is why the ISIL head and his family utilized his services.
On 10 March 2020, The Guardians of Religion Organization raided the town of Tanjarah, which was under control of the Syrian Army, and captured the town. Heavy fighting took place following a counterattack by the Syrian army to retake the town. 35 soldiers of the Syrian Army and 13 HaD fighters were killed in the fighting.
After a fallout within the Rouse the Believers Operation Room, the group joined four other jihadist groups on 12 June 2020 to form the "Be Steadfast Operation Room."
On 23 June, after putting up checkpoints around Idlib and refusing to take them down at Hayat Tahrir al-Sham requests an open conflict began between the two groups. The conflict killed 18 member of Hurras al-Din, 11 members of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and one civilian.
On 1 January 2021, the group attacked a Russian military base in the northern part of the Raqqa Governorate, in an area held by the Syrian Democratic Forces. The attack was notable for being carried outside of the group's main areas of operation in the Idlib Governorate. During the attack, five members of the group were killed carrying out suicide bombings and injuring between two to three Russian soldiers at the base.
Relations with other groups.
The Guardians of Religion Organization is part of the Stand Firm Operations Room, formerly the Rouse the Believers or Incite the Believers Operations Room. The Stand Firm Operations Room is the reconsolidation of the Incite the Believers Operations Room following Ansar al Tawhid's defection from it 3 May 2020. The Incite the Believers Operations Room was led by the Guardians of Religion Organization alongside three other Jihadist factions based in northwestern Syria, and alongside Ansar al-Tawhid, which was also part of the Rouse the Believers Operations Room and largely consists of former Jund al-Aqsa elements, established the Alliance to Support Islam in early 2018.
al-Qaeda.
The group broke away from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in 2018 a year after the formation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham due to internal tensions in the organization over issues including its allegiance to al-Qaeda and its leaders, furthermore the Khorasan Group that was believed by several intelligence agencies and analysts to be part of al-Nusra which later became HTS, is thought to have evolved into becoming part of the Guardians of Religion Organization. Al-Qaeda also reportedly sent senior cadres from its central command nodes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran to support the foundation of the Guardians of Religion Organization.
ISIL.
The group has instructed its members not to associate with ISIL with threat of expulsion from the group and prosecution, while ISIL declared the group to be heretical in its weekly newspaper "al-Naba".
However, there are believed to be ISIL-sympathizers in the Guardians of Religion Organization, and prior to the group's foundation as it began as a sub faction of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in 2017 the year of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's inception, ISIL reportedly began building ties with these elements prior to the group's formal foundation.
ISIL also began building a contingency plan upon their decline that involved regrouping in opposition held parts of Idlib, including asking the Syrian Democratic Forces during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani for passage out of the area to Idlib with assistance from the Guardians of Religion Organization, and the group playing a role in the process, with ISIL infiltrating it, by recruiting members of the group sympathetic to ISIL to act as agents including senior leadership, as well as facilitating a flow of displaced fighters from former ISIL-held territories and strongholds to Idlib to join the Guardians of Religion Organization, then carrying out assassinations and sabotage campaigns against individuals in the group and other groups and individuals opposed to ISIL, then formally declaring allegiance to ISIL, when ISIL saw the time as right.
In 2018, Iraqi media and security officials claimed to have captured members of the Guardians of Religion Organization embedded with ISIL fighters from the Syrian border town of Abu Kamal on the Iraqi border heading towards Iraq's Anbar Governorate, and that the group was seeking to expand its presence to northern and central Iraq, and that it was also working with the Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order, which is led by former Saddam Hussein-era Baathist officers, including Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the Iraqi government also claimed local political parties were financing the group to help it expand into former ISIL-held territories, however the validity of the reports has been questioned.
Prior the foundation the Guardians of Religion Organization, Sami al-Oraydi, who holds an influential position in the group, criticized ISIL and claimed they were Kharijites, and called them "Muslim Killers", he also said that Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, ISIL's official spokesman at the time, was ignorant and didn't understand the things he said, as well as several posts on Twitter critical of ISIL, during his tenure as al-Nusra's top Sharia official.
In 2016, Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian al-Qaeda member who later became part of the Guardians of Religion Organization's leadership, also criticized ISIL saying they were twisted and had perverted thoughts.
In January 2019, as part of a campaign a formation called "Free the female prisoners" was established, with the stated goals of freeing female ISIL prisoners held in Syrian Democratic Forces-run internment camps such as the Al-Hawl refugee camp. The formation is believed to be associated with the Guardians of Religion Organization. However a separate campaign with the same goal launched by ISIL itself called "Kafel" has denounced the Free the Female Prisoners campaign as apostates. Free the Female Prisoners has denied being linked to either ISIL or the Guardians of Religion Organization and claims to be an independent organization willing to work with any faction to achieve their goal of freeing female ISIL prisoners.
In August 2019, an unofficial ISIL media outlet called the Muhajireen Foundation, which provides reports and updates on events that may affect ISIL foreign fighters displaced in Syria, released an infographic showing three separate anti-ISIL operations by HTS in Idlib. One the raids carried out by HTS targeted members of the Guardians of Religion Organization and Ansar al-Tawhid who had ties to ISIL. Two of the arrested individuals were Egyptians. However previously in January 2019, the same foundation cautioned ISIL members displaced in Idlib to avoid large gatherings and avoid Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Guardians of Religion Organization, because HTS and the Guardians of Religion had arrested several ISIL members, the warning also called both HTS and the Guardians apostates.
In October 2019, based on a receipt book of ISIL reportedly found by associates of former American intelligence official Asaad Almohammad, analysts have stated that Baghdadi was paying the members of the group in exchange for hiding him. According to the receipts, ISIL paid at least $67,000 to them from early 2017 to mid-2018, including $7,000 in summer 2018 to prepare bases for ISIL fighters from "al-Khair province", hinting that they helped in smuggling ISIL members. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi pointed to the fact that two groups opposition towards each other. However, Tamimi also speculated that some of the receipts obtained were fabrications, except the ones from March to July 2018 that he was shown.
It is also believed that some members might also be part of a pro-ISIL faction despite the group's official stance regarding ISIL which is critical and generally opposed to it, including reportedly instructing its members not to associate with ISIL members, and ISIL viewing the group as heretical due to their support of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as the group's hesitance to confront Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, despite tensions between the two.
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
The group has held tensions with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham on numerous occasions but has largely avoided armed confrontation with HTS, with most of the tensions being confined to media campaigns against each other. In January 2019, the Guardians of Religion Organization accused HTS of being involved in a secret plan to establish a military council under the control of the mainstream Syrian opposition including ex-government defectors, that would be supervised by Turkey, the Guardians of Religion Organization also claimed that HTS was willing to open the M5 highway to traffic from government-held areas.
Though holding tensions with HTS, the leadership of the Guardians of Religion Organization is respected among HTS members, reportedly causing hesitance for the two to openly fight each other, and HTS adopting a policy of containing the group rather than confronting it in open conflict.
On 7 February 2019, members of the Guardians of Religion Organization shot at a car with HTS members inside following tensions in January. The Guardians of Religion Organization later signed an agreement following the incident, and the Guardians of Religion Organization apologized for killing an HTS member killed by the gunfire. Over the following days afterwards several agreements were made between HTS and the Guardians of Religion Organization to deescalate tensions between the two.
In late October 2019, a faction of the Guardians of Religion Organization led by a cleric named Abu al-Yaman al-Wazzani separated from the Guardians of Religion Organization, and formed a new group called Ansar al-Haq. Wazzani and his supporters claimed that the Guardians of Religion Organization had not held up obligations that they believe the Guardians of Religion Organization promised to uphold, and believed the Guardians of Religion Organization was lacking in the enforcement of Sharia law, followers of Wazzani were mostly reported to be former Jund al-Aqsa and Faylaq al-Sham fighters. Ansar al-Haq was also critical of HTS and its relaxed policy regarding Sharia, believing that HTS allowed immorality and did not implement justice, and also viewed HTS as an oppressive body. After the formation of Ansar al-Haq, HTS arrested Wazzani and his followers. HTS also holds tensions with Jaysh Khorasan, a group close to the Guardians of Religion Organization.
Analysis.
It is thought by the Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center that the formation of the group will weaken HTS. Alexander Sehmer of the Jamestown Foundation has stated that Guardians of the Religion Organization gives Al Qaeda the best opportunity to improve its fortunes in Syria.

Second-wave feminism in Germany

The emergence of second-wave feminism was a key component of feminism in Germany. The second wave (emerging during the first half of the 20th century) was heavily influenced by the policies of the Third Reich and its attitudes towards gender roles, and those of the postwar era.
First wave.
Historically, social systems throughout the world were organized paternally. Patriarchal structures can be found in all areas of society: in governmental power structures, in the economies of developing countries, in the sciences and in medicine. The first changes to this system appeared as a self-conscious, feminist movement.
The emergence of women's movements and the discussion of women's rights was contingent on the French Revolution's goals to achieve universal equality. On 14 September 1791, French feminist Olympe de Gouges demanded equal rights for men and women. During this period, the women's movement was influenced predominantly by class issues. Louise Otto-Peters is believed to be the founder of the first middle-class women's movement which pursued the participation of women in education and politics. According to Otto-Peters, female participation in politics was a duty rather than a right.
During the mid-19th century, women's movements formed in France, England, the United States, and Australia. Hubertine Auclert, editor of the newspaper "La Citoyenne" ("Female Citizen") coined the term "féminisme" in 1882 as a political principle. Auclert had protested the French government's decision to deny women the right to vote, stood as an illegal candidate for the French government and refused to pay taxes: "I have no rights, therefore, I have no taxes; I do not vote, I do not pay."
Auclert's term was introduced in 1896 at an international women's convention in Berlin (the Internationaler Kongress für Frauenwerke und Frauenbestrebungen) as a synonym for "Frauenbewegung" ("women's movement").
The Third Reich and women.
Nazism made drastic changes to German society, restructuring it around Nazi values. In 1933, Baldur von Schirach was appointed Reichsjugendführer (Reich youth leader) by Adolf Hitler. Before 1933, youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts existed as part of German Christian or political associations. Von Schirach formed a uniformed youth movement out of those groups, the Hitler Youth, with membership becoming mandatory in 1936.
The Hitler Youth was structured by gender. It had two groups: the militaristic Hitler Jugend and Deutsches Jungvolk for boys, and the Bund Deutscher Mädchen to train girls to be "obedient housewi[ves] and mother[s]".
In 1933, the Nazis banned female professors from teaching at universities. National Socialist legislation from 1933 to 1945 restricted women's right to attend university, leading to a rupture in academic employment and career development for women. Discriminatory Nazi legislature was also evident in the Judiciary Training Regulations of 22 July 1934, according to which female lawyers were "einen Einbruch in den altgeheiligten Grundsatz der Männlichkeit des Staates" ("an invasion of the holy and established principles of the nation's manliness"). The Nazis destroyed women's organizations, exiling Anita Augspurg and Lida Gustava Heymann (pioneers of the first women's movement and opponents of the Nazi regime) to Switzerland in 1933.
Near the end of World War II, women were required to work in factories to compensate for the lack of male labor. Although their economic value changed, their social status did not. Barbara Brennan described how they were perceived: "The German women who survived the Second World War are often characterized by the familiar images of long lines of women digging the country out from underneath the rubble."
After World War II.
After the collapse of the Third Reich, women were gradually relieved of their new duties by returning prisoners of war. Women who served the country during the war as volunteers or conscripts had to face the repercussions of their actions, which affected their careers and personal lives.
Feminism was virtually non-existent from 1945 to 1966. An important exception is a phrase in the human-rights section of the new German constitution, which states: "Men and women have equal rights". This is similar to the Weimarer Reichsverfassung, the Weimar Republic constitution, whose Article 109 read: "Alle Deutschen sind vor dem Gesetze gleich" ("All Germans are equal under the law") and "Männer und Frauen haben grundsätzlich dieselben staatsbürgerlichen Rechte und Pflichten" ("Men and women have strictly the same rights and obligations.")
1949 German constitution.
The 1949 German constitution was developed and written by a group of 65 politicians. Of the 65, only four were women: Frieda Nadig, Elisabeth Selbert, Helene Weber and Helene Wessel. All four were pioneers of the postwar German women's movement.
Elisabeth Selbert.
Selbert was a lawyer who had a limited primary and secondary education due to poverty. After finding a job in a telegraph office, Selbert graduated from college and attended law school in Göttingen and Marburg. One of five female law students among the 300 men, she passed her exams with honours just before the laws barring women from universities took effect in December 1934. Selbert became a leading advocate of sexual equality.
Frieda Nadig.
Nadig was born in Herford on 11 December 1897. Like her father, who was a German politician for the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) until 1931, she began her political career in 1916 and was elected as a representative of the provincial council in Westfalen. In 1933 the Provincial Diet was abolished by the Third Reich, and Nadig was no longer a representative. She refused to commit herself politically until 1947, when she became an elected SPD member of the new German state parliament of Nordrhein-Westfalen. In addition to her position as state representative, she was chosen as a member of the parliamentary council (Parlamentarischer Rat). Although Selbert and the SPD implemented gender equality in the German constitution, her demands for wage equality and equal treatment for children born to married and unmarried parents were unsuccessful.
Helene Weber.
Unencumbered by Nazi Party membership and providing expertise as a former member of the national council, Helene Weber became part of the parliament council at the behest of Konrad Adenauer (the Federal Republic of Germany's first chancellor). While creating the German constitution, the CDU (Christian Democratic Union of Germany) politician addressed its meaning and phrased it to emphasise the importance of human life and dignity. After hesitating about women's rights, she proposed "Männer und Frauen stehen bei Wahl und Ausübung des Berufes gleich, verrichten sie gleiche Arbeit, so haben sie Anspruch auf gleiche Entlohnung" ("Men and Women are equal in their choice and execution of work. If they accomplish the same, they have the right to equal wages.")
Equal Rights Law.
In 1957, the Equal Rights Law (Gleichberechtigungsgesetz) became effective. German legislation differs from the British and American legal systems, which are based on case law. In Germany, a 2,385-paragraph Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB, civil code) and a 358-paragraph Strafgesetzbuch (criminal code) resolve legal questions.
The BGB (influenced by the Napoleonic Code) was enacted on 1 January 1900, and many changes were needed to reconcile it with contemporary values. In 1949 (when the German constitution was enacted) equal rights were missing from the civil and criminal code, and the Equal Rights Law was intended to correct the omission. The final changes concerning gender inequality were made on 25 April 2006.
Existing problems.
From 1949 to 1965 Germany had a conservative government and Konrad Adenauer, its Roman Catholic chancellor, was regarded as resistant to change. Marriage and the family were protected by traditional role models, and a married woman's legal standing did not correspond with that of a married man. The husband's role as master of the house ("Haushaltsvorstand"), was legally defined. He made important decisions, and his consent was required for his wife to open a bank account. Until 1977 a married woman needed her husband's consent to obtain an employment contract, and he decided the use of his wife's earnings. Abuse (including rape) in a marriage was not punishable, unlike abortion.
Girls from rural or working-class backgrounds were heavily underrepresented in secondary and tertiary schools. War veterans were given preference at the few remaining universities in postwar Germany, and had taken most of the educational slots. Over 50 percent of women graduating from gymnasiums (Germany's academic secondary schools) were forced to abandon further academic education. Universities had very few female professors, and only one-third of all women were employed. Gender-specific, stereotypically-female jobs (known as low-wage or mini-jobs) were created to encourage women to remain housewives.
Second-wave feminism.
During the 1960s several feminist groups were founded, which were characterized as the second wave. University students began questioning their educators, many of whom were considered former Nazi collaborators:
This political environment enabled the formation of a new women's movement: second-wave feminism. At a 13 September 1968 conference of the Socialist German Student Association (Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund, or SDS), a female SDS activist of the SDS blamed her male colleagues for not pushing social criticism far enough and ignoring discrimination against women. The SDS was the mirror image of a masculine society. When the association did not discuss the issue and returned to the initial agenda, Sigrid Rüger (a member of the West Berlin SDS and Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frauen, the Mission for the Liberation of Women) hit an SDS board member with a tomato. That day, female members of the SDS regional councils founded Weiberräte ("hag-councils") and formed women's centres. The centres encouraged women to protest against "division of labour, birth control, laws, sexuality in politics and abortion".

Raymond Théberge

Raymond Théberge (born 1952 in Sainte-Anne-des-Chênes, Manitoba) is the ninth President and Vice-Chancellor of the Université de Moncton from June 1, 2012, to January 26, 2018, and the Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada since January 29, 2018.
Early life and education.
Théberge holds a Ph.D. in Linguistics from McGill University (1984), a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics from the University of Ottawa (1976) and a Bachelor of History degree from the Université de Saint-Boniface (1973).
Career.
After having finished his Ph. D., Théberge served as Director General of the Société franco-manitobaine for 1 year.
Academic career.
Between 1985 and 2003, he held several positions related to teaching, research and university administration. In 1985, he became director of the Research Center at the Université de Saint-Boniface, a position he held for 18 years. During this period, he also held other position. From 1994 to 1995, he was acting Dean Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the Université de Saint-Boniface. Théberge was president and director of the "Centre d’études franco canadiennes de l’Ouest" from 1995 to 2004. He was professor and associate professor at Université Laval between 2001 and 2003. In 1997, Raymond Théberge was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Education at the Université de Saint-Boniface, a position he held until 2003.
Raymond Théberge has authored more than 20 peer-reviewed publications, 84 papers and presentations, three books, a bibliography and 45 research projects on education, community, communication, culture and economics.
Public service.
Raymond Théberge then entered the Canadian public service as a senior official. From 2004 to 2005, he was Assistant Deputy Minister of the "Bureau de l’éducation française" in Manitoba's Department of Education, Citizenship and Youth. From 2005 to 2009, he headed the Council of Ministers of Education of Canada (CMEC) as executive director.
Raymond Théberge has been a member of the Board of the UNESCO International Bureau of Education, and a member of the Working Group for the Preparation of the International Conference education. Raymond Théberge also chaired the following institutions: the "Council of the Deans and Directors of Education in Manitoba", the "Manitoba Teacher Education and Teaching Certification Committee", the "Departmental Task Force on Teacher Shortages in Manitoba", and the "Francophone Association of Deans and Directors of Education in Canada". He was Co-Chair of the "Round Table on Basic Education" organized by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
University of Moncton.
In June 2012, Mr. Théberge was named President and Vice-Chancellor of the Université de Moncton, the largest francophone university in Canada outside of the province of Quebec. Under his leadership, the university's first ever strategic plan was implemented, based on extensive consultation and dialogue with the province's post-secondary, francophone and Acadian communities.
Commissioner of official languages.
In December 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment of Raymond Théberge as Canada's next Commissioner of Official Languages. He began his duties as Commissioner on January 29, 2018.
Nomination of Mary Simon as governor general.
On July 19, 2021 Théberge confirmed that his office would "investigate the process for nominating governors general" in Canada, following over 400 complaints to his Office that the governor general designate, Mary Simon, does not speak French. Simon is fluent in English and Inuktitut, and has committed to learning French as part of her mandate. The governor general is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch. 
The investigation will target the Privy Council Office for its advisory role in the governor general selection process. In an official statement, Théberge addressed a perception of nominations to high offices in Canada. "Too often, I see a discourse that puts respect for diversity and inclusion on one hand, and respect for official languages on the other, as if they could not coexist. I would like to remind decision-makers that it is entirely possible to respect official languages while being inclusive.". In the same statement, Théberge nonetheless noted that Simon's appointment could enable her to help preserve Indigenous and minority languages in Canada. 
The Official Languages Act does not mandate any language requirement for the governor general, nor does it provide the Commissioner with any authority to provide any remedy or relief, apart from the ability to author reports for Parliament's consideration. However, the Act obliges the commissioner to investigate good-faith complaints related to alleged non-compliance of "the spirit and intent" of the Official Languages Act with regard to the "administration of the affairs of any federal institution." Since the adoption of the Official Languages Act in 1969, two unilingual anglophone governors general were appointed: Ed Schreyer and Ray Hnatyshyn. Neither they nor the process for their nomination was investigated by the Commissioner for Official Languages at the time.

Borasseae

Borasseae is a tribe in the palm subfamily Coryphoideae. The tribe ranges from southern Africa and Madagascar north through the Arabian Peninsula to India, Indochina, Indonesia and New Guinea. Several genera are restricted to islands in the Indian Ocean. The two largest genera, "Hyphaene" and "Borassus", are also the most widespread.
Description.
Borassoid palms typically have large, column-like trunks, though several species of "Hyphaene" have branching or clustered stems. The leaves are large, palmate and often with spines or sharp edges along the petioles. Leaves are retained on young palm stems, later falling to reveal prominent scars. All genera in the Borasseae are dioecious, with separate male and female trees; they are pleonanthic, flowering regularly for many years. Inflorescences are large and pendulous; the male flowers are much smaller than the female and are borne in clusters within catkin-like structures. Fruits contain hard, woody endocarps surrounding the seeds; they range in size from date-sized ("Latania") to the massive fruits of "Lodoicea", which contain the largest seed in the world.
Taxonomy.
The Borasseae is one of eight tribes in subfamily Coryphoideae. The tribe is monophyletic and most phylogenetic studies place it as sister to tribe Corypheae, though it is also close to tribe Caryoteae and tribe Chuniophoeniceae. Together, the four tribes make up the syncarpous clade, all members of which have syncarpous ovaries with united carpels.
The eight genera of tribe Borasseae split evenly into two subtribes. In the palms of subtribe Hyphaenieae, both the male and female flowers are sunken within pits and the fruits are stalked and typically one-seeded. "Bismarckia" (1 sp., "B. nobilis") and "Satranala" (1 sp., "S. decussilvae") are endemic to Madagascar, "Medemia" (1 sp., "M. argun") is restricted to Egypt and Sudan, while "Hyphaene" (8 spp.) ranges from southern Africa and Madagascar to western India. In subtribe Lataniieae, only the male flowers are sunken in pits and the fruits are sessile, with 1-3 seeds. "Lodoicea" (1 sp., "L. maldivica") is endemic to the Seychelles, "Latania" (3 spp.) is endemic to the Mascarene Islands, while "Borassodendron" has two species, one in Borneo ("B. borneense") and one in the Malay Peninsula ("B. machadonis"). The last of the genera, "Borassus" (5 spp.), is the most widespread and is found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia and New Guinea. An extinct genus of the subtribe Hyphaeninae is known from the Maastrichtian aged Intertrappean Beds of India.
Conservation.
Many species in tribe Borasseae are threatened with extinction (36% of total recognized species):

Norman Zamcheck

"The Real Stormin" Norman Zamcheck (born 1947) is an American pianist and singer/songwriter, best known as bandleader of the New York-based Real Stormin' Norman Band, and the rock/vaudeville group Stormin' Norman and Suzy. Considered an innovator in the blues-ragtime revival, Zamcheck is known for his boogie-woogie blues, rag, and klezmer piano technique; his original long-form ballad songs; as well as for musicals and film soundtracks.
Life and career.
Early career.
Zamcheck was born in Washington, D.C., but raised in Newton, a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts. Zamcheck is a member of the Boston-based Zamcheck musical family. Alongside his siblings Mark and Erica (of The Make., Mother Zamcheck's Bacon Band, and "Zamcheck"), Zamcheck was an influential member of the New England rock scene of the early 1970's.
Zamcheck's professional career began in 1969 as a songwriter and keyboardist for the rock collective Milkweed, composed of students from Yale University. Milkweed, an orchestral folk-rock group, played with major rock acts such as the Allman Brothers, Jimmy Buffett, and John Hammond Jr., during the 1970 and 1971 summer music festival seasons. Soon after leaving Milkweed in 1971, Zamcheck began a decades-long collaboration with singer Suzy Williams of Venice, California.
Stormin' Norman and Suzy.
The duo, Stormin' Norman and Suzy, released their first LP, "Fantasy Rag", on Perfect Crime Records, in 1975, and toured throughout New England playing clubs, saloons, and hotels. Stormin' Norman and Suzy signed to Polydor Records in 1976, and released their second LP, "Ocean of Love". With a newly formed Stormin' Norman and Suzy Band including the musicians Mark Ribot, Mark Schulman, and Joe Dimone, they moved to New York to begin an open residency at Tramp's Cabaret, an event the New York Times called "The Hottest Act in Town". With positive reviews from major media publications, the Stormin' Norman and Suzy Band went on to play events at Carnegie Hall, network television showcases, and toured with acts including Bette Midler, Tom Waits, Loudon Wainwright III, Roosevelt Sykes, and The Manhattan Transfer. The band embarked on an international tour in 1979. In 1980, they began a 2-month-residency at the Hotel Palmas in The Canary Islands.
During the early 1980's, Stormin' Norman and Suzy developed musicals, cabaret programs, and various collaborations, including a tour with Moses Pendleton's Pilobolus Dance Company. However, by the late 1980's, Suzy and Norman were pursuing independent projects. By 1989, Williams had moved back to Los Angeles to develop her solo career and her Venice-based big band, Suzy and the Solid Senders, and SN&amp;S had mostly stopped performing.
In 2007, after a two-decade hiatus, the Stormin' Norman and Suzy Band reunited for a tour on the east coast and released their third album, "Live at the P &amp; G Bar". They have toured again in 2008, 2012, and 2014
Real Stormin' Norman.
In response to the proliferation of "Stormin' Norman's", Zamcheck initiated the moniker "The Real Stormin' Norman" in 2006, with the release of his CD "Everyone Tells a Story" (Abaraki). Ending a decade-long break from public performance, Zamcheck's new band began performing regularly in New York. They have released four albums on the Abaraki label; "Matchbox Universe", "Newton, 1969", and "The Oyster" in January, 2018.
The Real Stormin' Norman Band has been called "the longest running rock-big band gig in New York", with open-ended residencies at jazz and rock standards The Bitter End, The Shrine, and Silvana's Lounge. Long-term members include Tad McCully, Pete O'Connel, Ryoku Fukishiro, John "Gerry Putnam", Adrienne Asterita, "Even Stephen" Levee, Rodger Bartlett, and others.
Other works.
In 1978, Zamcheck, together with Suzy Williams, collaborated with director Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause) on the soundtrack for Ray's final film, "We Can't Go Home Again". The duo appear throughout Ray's film, singing Zamcheck's song "Bless the Family".. Thirty years later, Zamcheck contributed to the soundtrack for "Don't Expect Too Much", a documentary about the making of "We Can't Go Home Again". The original film, as well as the documentary, were released posthumously by Oscilloscope in 2012 at Lincoln Center, with a reunion performance by Stormin' Norman and Suzy.
Zamcheck has also written musicals, including "Cinderella Street" (performed with Suzy at the Silver Linings Cabaret Theatre in 1979); and "Checkov Shmekov", which debuted at the New York Musical Festival in January, 2018.
Zamcheck was keyboardist for Andy Statman's Klezmer Orchestra in the early 90's, during their tours of Europe and Israel.
Musical style.
During the Stormin' Norman and Suzy years, critics focused on Zamcheck's ragtime, vaudeville, and old-timey style. The New York Times critic Robert Palmer deemed Zamcheck "a turpentine camp blues pianist, a turn-of-the-century-jazz and ragtime ivory tickler", while Rolling Stone critic Robert Christgau considered Zamcheck's songs to be "piquant 20's camp". Critics generally referred to SN&amp;S's eclecticism, and disagreed as to whether the duo was a nostalgic comedy act -"A down-and dirty dance-hall duo that might've entertained cowpokes in the wild west" (Washington Post); or a serious musical project; "exceptionally original…. modern without sounding strident…." (New York Times). SN&amp;S were generally seen as a divergence from rock trends of the late 70's, as described in a 1976 profile in The New York Times; "In New Jersey's recent rock revival, Bruce Springsteen is being touted as the biggest sensation since Sinatra; his cronies, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Dukes, have a large club following and Jersey‐born Patti Smith is being pushed as a national star. But here at Upsala College, a small, sleepy school where intimacy seems pleasant, not oppressive, many students seemed to prefer the folksy, slightly nostalgic approach of Stormin' Norman and Suzy (and their hack‐up band) to the piercing sound of hard rock".
Other critics focused on Suzy's star power, and questioned the potential of SN&amp;S as a vehicle for Zamcheck's music; "Stormin' Norman and Suzy have returned to [Tramps], the room where they have acquired a following. Suzy is a funny, racy, slightly atavistic cross between a Texas Guinean and a contemporary folkie, but Stormin' Norman would be better christened vaguely Competent Norman; she deserved a better band". (New York Magazine, 1977); "Norman writes the songs and the band mugs and clowns while performing them, but the focus is Suzy. With the voice and the generally cut floozy appearance of a fresh Janis Joplin, Suzy delivers an off-the-wall performance of jazzy-blues and barroom rag" (Billboard). In a similar vein, Norman was considered a nuisance to his own songs in the Rolling Stone review of Fantasy Rag; "Suzy Williams's natural echo, which calls up images of riverboats and cathouse pianos despite the thin recording. Unfortunately, Norman Zamcheck's voice calls up images of an account executive fulfilling his inner nature".

Anastasia Vashukevich

Anastasia Vashukevich (; born 27 February 1990, Babruysk, Byelorussian SSR), also known as Nastya Rybka (), is a Belarusian escort worker and author who claimed to have evidence linking Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Early life and family.
Born Anastasia Kostina (; ) on 27 February 1990 in Babruysk, Byelorussian SSR, when her mother, a well-known ophthalmologist, was forty. She has no siblings.
She attended night school after being expelled from school in ninth grade. She became pregnant when she was 16 and married to become Anastasia Semenchuk (; ). She had a son Yury (). She attended the institute in Belarus Mazyr and received an environmental degree in absentia. She was 18 when she started a romance on the side; later, she divorced.
US election related photographs, video, and audio recordings.
During 2016 to 2017, Vashukevich met with Oleg Deripaska at least three times: during August 2016 on Deripaska's yacht "Elden" off the coast of Norway with Sergei Prikhodko, during September to October 2016 in southern Russia at Deripaska's mansion, and during January 2017 at Lech, Austria, with United States lobbyist Adam Waldman of the firm Endeavor Group. As of January 2019, Vashukevich has written three books about her relationship with Deripaska: "Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire" ( "lit." The Billionaire Seduction Diary, or Clone for the Oligarch) (); "Eurotrash, How to Seduce the Rich for the Poor" (); and a third unpublished book.
Released in September 2017 in collaboration with Alex Lesley, Vashukevich's book "Eurotrash, How to Seduce the Rich for the Poor" details her trip to Lech, Austria, in early January 2017 with Oleg Deripaska to meet with Adam Waldman, who through Waldman's firm, Endeavor Group, has been a lobbyist for Deripaska since 2009 and for Julian Assange. On 12–13 January 2017, Adam Waldman met with Julian Assange just days after Waldman's Lech, Austria, meeting in a bar at Deripaska's five star Aurelio Hotel with Deripaska and Vashukevich on 7 January 2017. Vashukevich made a video recording with her phone of the 7 January 2017 meeting in the bar.
In her unpublished book, she describes a three-day trip during the fall of 2016 to Deripaska's mansion near Krasnodar where an important-looking man arrived in an all terrain vehicle to discuss issues with Deripaska. Vashukevich recorded these meetings with her phone hidden behind some books.
Vashukevich said that she was close to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and business links to Paul Manafort. She claimed the recorded voices included Deripaska's discussing the 2016 presidential election with other people, including at least three fluent English speakers who she believed were Americans. On 8 February 2018, Alexei Navalny released a video using material obtained by Vashukevich about an August 2016 meeting between Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Prikhodko in which United States and Russia foreign policy was discussed as well as Prikhodko's friend United States diplomat Victoria Nuland and the 2016 United States elections. According to the video, Deripaska served as a liaison between the Russian government and Paul Manafort during Russian interference efforts in United States elections. Navalny correlates Vashukevich's book "Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire" to persons, settings, and events in the Vashukevich film. In the video known as "Fishgate", "Fish Gate" or "Rybka Gate" (), Navalny explains the characters and setting for Nastya Rybka's book "Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire": "Ruslan Zolotov" is Deripaska, "Papa" is Prikhodko, "Vitya" or "Victor" is Yevgeny Agarkov () and the Rybka book's setting of Greenland is actually Norway. Rybka refers to Papa as Richelieu, or a Cardinal in the Kremlin who is the person actually responsible for Russia's foreign policy during the governments of Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, and Dmitri Medvedev. Through Adam Waldman, Deripaska has denied bribery allegations presented in the video.
Deripaska filed a lawsuit in Deripaska's hometown court at Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, against Rybka and Leslie for publishing material about him. On 10 February 2018, Roskomnadzor placed Navalny's website and his investigation video on the prohibited log. On 24 February 2018, Navalny removed his investigation video from his website.
Arrest in Thailand.
On 25 February 2018, Vashukevich was arrested at a hotel in Pattaya, Thailand, and held at Nong Pla Lai Prison. According to Vladimir Sosnov, the head of the consular department of the Russian embassy in Thailand, Rybka was one of ten Russian experts on lovemaking that were detained "awaiting trial and deportation from Thailand." While in custody, she reached out to the American government seeking asylum in exchange for photographs and 16 hours of audio recordings she made in August 2016, that could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She was visited by FSB, CIA, and many times by Vladimir Pronin, the Russia consul for the Pattaya consular district, but the FBI was not allowed to visit because Thai officials only allowed visitors that were legal representatives for her and her family members. According to Jillian Bonnardeaux spokesperson for the United States embassy in Bangkok, all matters involving asylum are directed to Kirstjen Nielsen and the Department of Homeland Security. Vladimir Pronin gained her release for time served if she left Thailand which she did and, according to court order, returned to Belarus. According to Anti-Corruption Foundation, Deripaska has arranged her imprisonment in Thailand through his agents. Vashukevich believed that Nikolai Patrushev who had traveled to Thailand was involved.
Disruption to Russian websites.
Soon after Vashukevich was arrested, Navalny began posting more of her photographs on his website. The Russian internet agency Roskomnadzor restricted access to Navalny's website,&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar_4/30/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was on the Telegram network, also blocking as many as 18 million other sites, and triggering anti-censorship demonstrations against Putin.
Relinquishment of recordings, apology.
In August 2018, Vashukevich said she had sent the audio recordings to Deripaska without making them public, hoping he would be able to gain her release from prison. She said she promised Deripaska she would not make any further comment on the recordings' contents. In court, Vashukevich apologized to Deripaska and Prikhodko.
In 2018, Deripaska won a legal case in Deripaska's hometown court at Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, against Vashukevich for the invasion of his privacy by the public availability of videos and photos of the two of them together. Deripaska sued for 1 million rubles from each Vashukevich and Kirillov but the court set the payment at 500,000 rubles for each Vashukevich and Kirillov.
Later Arrest and release.
Vashukevich was arrested at Sheremetyevo Airport Moscow in January 2019 while in transit from Thailand to Belarus for reportedly drawing people into prostitution. After videos showing her being violently arrested and pleading for her life in court were leaked to the press, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko demanded her release. She was immediately released. Vashukevich said she was warned not to discuss Deripaska while in Russian custody. She said her claims about him were intended to save her from death while detained in Thailand.
Later life.
Her second marriage was to Nikolai Vashukevich (; ) but she left him and the 11-year-old son Yuri for Moscow. Upon her return to Moscow in January 2019, Nikolai Vashukevich filmed the extremely rough treatment and arrest of Anastasia Vashukevich by Moscow police at the Sheremetyevo International Airport.

Throwback Today

Throwback Today is a 2017 Philippine independent science fiction film directed by Joseph Teoxon in his debut feature film, starring Carlo Aquino. The film premiered on November 15, 2017 at the 2017 Cinema One Originals Film Festival.
The film tells about a disgruntled young production designer named Primo (Carlo Aquino) who stumbles upon an old computer which enables him to communicate with his college self through chat as a result of a glitch in his computer. He instructs his self in an attempt to change his life.
Reception.
Critical response.
Fred Hawson of ABS-CBN and to his blog "Fred Said" gave the film six out of ten stars, and stated that, "The film's story was still very engaging to the end. Thanks to Carlo Aquino's earnest portrayal, you will care for what happens to Primo's character. There were some nice touches, like the wrist tattoos which change with each change in Primo's situation." Hawson also praised the director of the film and stated, "I [re]commend director Joseph Teoxon for his audacious choice of a complex time-themed sci-fi love story (by Pertee Brinas) for a debut feature, and pulling it off satisfactorily despite obvious technical limitations."
Ace Antipolo on his blog website "Movies for Millennials", gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and comparing the film to 2004's science fiction psychological thriller "The Butterfly Effect" starring Ashton Kutcher. He also stated that, "Though the two films have a similar premise, "Throwback Today" has more heart. It's more lighter in tone and thus, far more enjoyable than the other one. Although the concept of changing your past isn't new anymore as we have seen a lot of films recycling the same concept over and over again, this sci-fi entry stands out with its fun and entertaining execution." Antipolo also praised Carlo Aquino's performance to the film.

William Ernest Gillespie

William Ernest Gillespie (February 9, 1912 – November 5, 1967) was an American educator who served as assistant principal, dean of faculty, and interim principal at Phillips Exeter Academy.
Early Life and Career.
Gillespie was born on February 9, 1912 in Exeter, New Hampshire to Walter and Margaret (Alexander) Gillespie. His father taught Latin at Phillips Exeter from 1910 to 1940. He was educated at local public schools, and graduated from Phillips Exeter in 1929. He went on to study at Princeton University, where he graduated in 1933, and earned his MA and PhD degrees in classics in 1935 and 1937, respectively. Beginning his career in teaching Latin at Exeter in September 1939, he was only absent from the school for three years when he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He was appointed assistant to the principal in 1960, taking charge of a variety of administrative matters for principal William Saltonstall; upon the latter's resignation in June 1963 to join the Peace Corps, he was named acting principal for one year, until the appointment of Richard W. Day. Under Day's leadership, Gillespie served as assistant principal and dean of the faculty.
Acting Principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, 1963-1964.
As acting principal, Gillespie introduced numerous long-lasting changes to Academy regulations and policy, most notably regarding smoking and drug abuse. For example, recognizing the growing evidence of the harmful effects of smoking, Gillespie himself quit smoking and introduced more stringent restrictions on smoking by students. In 1964, Gillespie permitted the secretary of the Communist Party to speak in the Academy assembly hall, but then denied the same privilege to Richard Alpert and Timothy Leary, who both had been suspended from the Harvard University faculty. Exeter students criticized Gillespie for this apparent inconsistency regarding freedom of speech, but he regained their support after presenting his case in a forthright address to students in chapel by pointing out the difference between the dangers of Communism and of hallucinogenic drugs.
"Warm Nest" Comment, 1964.
In Gillespie's last public speech to the Academy, an address to the seniors at the commencement of 1964, his closing words aroused no little misinterpretation and controversy.It is nearly time for you to be off. You have a lot to do. This is no time to concern ourselves with nostalgia. As a matter of fact, I don't think anybody has ever claimed that Exeter is a warm nest. But I hope, and I expect, that when you find yourselves involved in skirmishes on the frontiers of barbarism, which are not very far away, you'll strike some shrewd blows in favor of civilization. Some day you'll come back to show us your trophies and your scars, and we'll be glad to see you.Coming at a time of societal discontent and upheaval in America, Gillespie's words were widely misinterpreted and misquoted. "Exeter is not a warm nest" became a rallying cry among advocates for reform, specifically with regard to what was then perceived as a harsh advising and disciplinary system.
Gillespie died on November 5, 1967, in Exeter Hospital. He was married to Janet Lansing Wicks, with whom he had four children, two sons and two daughters.

Civil liability in recreational diving

The civil liability of a recreational diver may include a duty of care to another diver during a dive. Breach of this duty that is a proximate cause of injury or loss to the other diver may lead to civil litigation for damages in compensation for the injury or loss suffered.
Participation in recreational diving implies acceptance of the inherent risks of the activity Diver training includes training in procedures known to reduce these risks to a level considered acceptable by the certification agency, and issue of certification implies that the agency accepts that the instructor has assessed the diver to be sufficiently competent in these skills at the time of assessment and to be competent to accept the associated risks. Certification relates to a set of skills and knowledge defined by the associated training standard, which also specifies the limitations on the scope of diving activities for which the diver is deemed competent. These limitations involve depth, environment and equipment that the diver has been trained to use. Intentionally diving significantly beyond the scope of certified competence is at the diver's risk, and may be construed as negligence if it puts another person at risk. Recommendations generally suggest that extending the scope should be done gradually, and preferably under the guidance of a diver experienced in similar conditions. The training agencies usually specify that any extension of scope should only be done by further training under a registered instructor, but this is not always practicable, or even possible, as there can always be circumstances that differ from those experienced during training.
Retention of skills requires exercise of those skills, and prolonged periods between dives will degrade skills by unpredictable amounts. This is recognised by training agencies which require instructors to keep in date, and recommend that divers take part in refresher courses after long periods of diving inactivity.
Duty.
A recreational diver may have a duty of care to another diver if one of these conditions occurs:
The existence of a duty of care between two persons depends on the relationship between them. Dive buddies who depend on each other to perform tasks such as equipment checks and provide assistance in an emergency are obliged to act reasonably and not increase the risks of the activity, but may be excluded from liability by assumption of the risk or waiver.
Duty of the operator.
Where relevant, the dive operator is responsible for:
In some jurisdictions the dive boat skipper may be legally obliged to be licensed to operate a dive boat. In South Africa a "diving endorsement" to the skipper's certificate of competence is a requirement to operate a dive boat as a commercial operation.
In a number of US cases, the failure of a charter operator to assign a buddy has been ruled a breach of the industry standard of care. It is not clear what competence or certification is required to allocate buddy pairs, and whether this duty would also apply to a boat operator who is not a divemaster or instructor. Defendants have argued that a person who dived without an allocated buddy was contributorily negligent as they also did not meet the appropriate standard of care.
Duty of the diver.
The certified diver is responsible for ensuring that their personal equipment, competence and fitness is sufficient to ensure their own safety in and under the water on the planned dive, allowing for reasonably foreseeable contingencies, and to follow safe diving practices.
A diver in training may not be competent to assume one or more of these duties, or their competence may be limited, depending on their existing certification. The duty of care of the instructor is to compensate for the known or reasonably predictable shortfalls in the learner's competence.
Responsibilities of buddies.
The responsibilities of dive buddies have been established by training standards and usage. Buddies are responsible for: 
Training agencies may differ in the detail of the procedures divers are expected to use in each of these cases. In most cases both systems work and are reasonably compatible when they require the active participation of one diver at a time, but there are examples where differences could lead to complications. For example, the specific procedures for sharing air can vary considerably between agencies, and have changed over time. It is quite possible for a buddy pair to have been trained in two conflicting protocols for air sharing, and each use equipment selected according to the system they were trained to use. In an emergency this could lead to sub-optimal response even if the procedures had been agreed during planning.
Divers may be given vague, conflicting and outmoded advice:
Solo diving option.
An option for some divers is to dive without a buddy. Although this would relieve the diver of any duty to a buddy and any related liability, this may not be permitted by the service provider, or in a few cases, by national law.
Not all dive professionals agree that the buddy system is entirely preferable to solo diving. Even professionals who basically support the buddy system in theory accept that in practice it often leaves a great deal to be desired, and that in some circumstances diving solo may be safer as this avoids the hazards imposed by a panicked or incompetent buddy. Solo diving advocates also contend that most dives do not follow the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, as the divers are often too far apart to notice if a problem occurs or to respond effectively.
Remedies.
The usual strategies used by divers to minimize the likelihood of being sued and the consequences of a lawsuit are insurance, liability releases and care in selecting a buddy. Following the accepted procedures when buddy diving, ensuring personal competence and taking due care will reduce the risk of an incident occurring due to fault of the diver.
Inherent dangers and assumption of risk.
In recreational diving the participant is taking on a voluntary risk.
In sport participants accept that other participants may be careless and may cause injuries to others due to inept behaviour.
Assumption of risk is a defense in the law of torts, which bars or reduces a plaintiff's right to recovery against a negligent tortfeasor if the defendant can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which they were participating at the time of the injury.
What is usually meant by assumption of risk is more precisely termed "primary" or "express" assumption of risk. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability on the theory that upon assumption of the risk, there is no longer a duty of care between the defendant and the plaintiff, and without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on their part. However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity. The "specific" risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply. Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.
Breach.
To establish negligence in a civil court there must be a breach of duty which can be shown to have caused harm to the other person.
A breach is a failure to follow an appropriate standard of care where a duty exists based on a relationship. This can occur between buddies and between a provider and a client.
Once it is established that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff/claimant, the matter of whether or not that duty was breached must be settled. A defendant who knowingly exposes the plaintiff/claimant to a substantial risk of loss, or fails to recognise a substantial risk of loss to the plaintiff/claimant, which any reasonable person in the same situation would clearly recognise, breaches that duty.
Negligence.
The standard action in tort is negligence. The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. Negligence actions include claims following personal injury accidents of many kinds, including scuba diving.
If although not intending to do harm someone can reasonably foresee that their actions could harm another person, and they continue with those actions and do not stop, and that other person is eventually injured or suffers damages as a consequence of those actions, that is negligence, and the injured party can hold the negligent person liable for compensation.
Dereliction of duty of care.
A person who has a legal duty to take reasonable care and does not do so, can be held liable for damages that are directly caused by the breach of that duty. Directly caused means that the injury or damage is a direct consequence of the failure to perform the reasonable duty. Reasonable care is the standard of care that is considered reasonable to expect in a given situation, taking into account the conditions, experience, training, qualifications, etc. The standard does not require perfection and makes allowance for mistakes and errors in judgement, provided that the person has exercised caution appropriate to the circumstances. In determining a standard of care, the courts would take an objective approach, and take into account the person's specific knowledge or experience, and the level at which the person represented themself.
Litigation.
When a voluntarily accepted risk leads to an involuntary injury there must be evidence of someone either doing something that they should not have done or not doing something that they should have done before a claim for damages can succeed. 
A large proportion of cases are litigated due to uncertainty of the cause of the accident.
The history of appeal cases in the USA tend to rule that the buddy relationship creates a duty to act reasonably and not increase the risks associated with diving. The existence of damages can usually be proven though the amount may be contested. The aspect that is usually litigated is whether a breach occurred and whether the breach was a proximate case of the injury. A defense often raised is assumption of the risk by the plaintiff, supported where applicable by a signed waiver.
In about 70% of diving fatalities, drowning is reported as the cause of death, without specifying the reason for drowning. Drowning generally just means that the diver died underwater and there was no physical obstacle to water entering the respiratory passages. It is a diagnosis that is often reached in the absence of a more specific understanding of the sequence of events, and often reached when little effort has gone into the investigation to exclude other possible causes to find out why the diver drowned.
There is a common misconception and presumption by the general public that someone should have intervened to prevent the drowning, which presupposes that someone should have known it was happening, and was negligent in not taking preventative action. A large amount of litigation is based on the desire to hold someone else accountable, and this is aggravated by the commonly inadequate investigation and vague conclusions regarding the trigger and sequence of events in fatal accidents. Statistic indicate that the majority of diving fatalities are due to error on the part of the victim.
Preservation of evidence.
Failure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts.
Proximate cause.
In law, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause, which tends to be an act or omission by a person. Legal causation is the "causal relationship between conduct and result". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury, as a means to establishing the scope of liability. In many cases negligence can be attributed to both the plaintiff, or decedent, and the defendants. The degree of negligence established by the court reduces the recovery of damages in that proportion.
Damages.
In a claim for damages the plaintiff must convince the court that injury or loss occurred, and that the compensation value claimed is realistic. Damages are likely to be limited to those reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. If a defendant could not reasonably have foreseen that someone might be hurt by their actions, there may be no liability.

Jon Blistein of "Rolling Stone" described the song as "brash", writing that it features "heavy bass and light-yet-sinister synths and crisp percussion". Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" mentioned that the song is "powerful" and "glamorous". Mike Nied of Idolator stated: "The track signifies a retreat to more comfortable ground after searching for crossover appeal with saccharine releases like "Player," "Superlove" and "Flame." Instead, Tinashe hops on a fierce production to drop some brag-heavy verses."
Live performances.
Tinashe performed No Drama on "Good Morning America" on April 6, 2018 and the "Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" on April 12, 2018.

Lucius Arruntius Stella was a Roman senator, who was active during the reigns of Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. He was suffect consul in October of 101 as the colleague of Lucius Julius Marinus Caecilius Simplex. He is known from the works of the poets Martial and Statius. Martial records Stella wrote poems, in a style influenced by Catullus and Tibullus. None of his poems have survived.
According to Martial, Stella had come from Patavium in northern Italy. He was appointed to organize the games that celebrated Domitian's victory over the Chatti and Dacians in either the year 89 or 93. Stella had also become a member of the "Quindecimviri sacris faciundis", the Roman priesthood entrusted with the care of the Sibylline oracles, which admitted him by AD 91.
Statius wrote an epithalamium, or a marriage poem, for Stella. It is from this work we learn the identity of his wife: Violentilla, a wealthy Neapolitan widow.

Jan Grabowski

Jan Grabowski (born 1962) is a Polish-Canadian professor of history at the University of Ottawa, specializing in Jewish–Polish relations in German-occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust in Poland.
Co-founder in 2003 of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research, in Warsaw, Poland, Grabowski is best known for his book "" (2013), which won the Yad Vashem International Book Prize.
Early life and education.
Grabowski was born in Warsaw to a Roman Catholic mother and Jewish father. His father, , a Holocaust survivor and chemistry professor from Kraków, fought in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.
While at the University of Warsaw, Grabowski was active in the Independent Students' Union between 1981 and 1985, where he helped to run an underground printing press for the Solidarity movement. He received his M.A. in 1986, and in 1988 he emigrated to Canada. Travel restrictions had been eased by Poland's communist government. If he had known the regime would fall a year later, he would have stayed, he told an interviewer: "When I left in 1988 I thought there was no future for any young person in Poland. It felt like you were looking at the world through a thick wall of glass. It was sort of an un-reality ... the rules were oblique, strange, inhuman even. Then after one year the system seemed to collapse like a house of cards." He received his Ph.D. from the Université de Montréal in 1994 for a thesis entitled "The Common Ground. Settled Natives and French in Montréal 1667–1760".
Academic appointments.
Grabowski became a faculty member at the University of Ottawa in 1993. In 2016–17 he was an Ina Levine Invitational Scholar at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where he conducted research into the Polish Blue Police for a project entitled "Polish 'Blue' Police, Bystanders, and the Holocaust in Occupied Poland, 1939–1945". He received a grant for the project (2016–2020) from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.
Research.
"Hunt for the Jews".
Grabowski is best known for his book "Hunt for the Jews", first published in Poland in 2011 as "Judenjagd: Polowanie na Żydów 1942–1945". In 2013 a revised and updated edition was published by Indiana University Press as "", and in 2016 a revised and expanded edition was published in Hebrew by Yad Vashem.
Awarded the Yad Vashem International Book Prize in 2014, the book describes the "Judenjagd" (German: "Jew hunt") from 1942 onwards, focusing on Dąbrowa Tarnowska County, a rural area in southeastern Poland. The "Judenjagd" was the German search for Jews who had escaped from the liquidated ghettos in Poland and were trying to hide among the non-Jewish population. Grabowski relied on Polish court records from the 1940s, post-war testimony collected by the Central Committee of Polish Jews, and records gathered in Germany during investigations in the 1960s. In a 2015 interview, he described the mechanics of the "hunt": 
According to Grabowski, most Jews in hiding were given up by local people to the Polish Blue Police or directly to the Germans. He said that Poles were "directly or indirectly" responsible for most of the deaths of over 200,000 Jews, not counting victims of the police; he explained that by "most", it could be 60 percent or as high as 90 percent.
The book sparked a heated public debate in Poland.
"The Polish Police".
Grabowski's book "The Polish Police: Collaboration in the Holocaust" (2017), published by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, is based on his 2016 Ina Levine Annual Lecture on the Blue Police.
"Dalej jest noc".
In 2018 Grabowski and Barbara Engelking co-edited a two-volume study, "Dalej jest noc: losy Żydów w wybranych powiatach okupowanej Polski" (Night without End: The Fates of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland). Published by the Polish Center for Holocaust Research, the study focused on nine counties in German-occupied Poland during the Holocaust, giving a detailed account of the fate of the area's Jews and of the question of Polish collaboration with the German occupiers. Grabowski contributed a chapter on Węgrów County. He told a newspaper that the work "talks about Polish virtue just as much. It paints a truthful picture."
Mark Weitzman, director of government affairs for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said it was "meticulously researched and sourced". Polish historian Jacek Chrobaczyński commended its authors for deconstructing political myths that persist in Polish history, journalism, church, and politics.
However, scholars associated with Poland's Institute of National Remembrance alleged that the study used unreliable sources, selectively treated witness statements, presented rumor as fact, and underestimated the draconian nature of the German occupation. 
The Polish League Against Defamation funded a civil case against Grabowski and Engelking in Poland, brought by the 81-year-old niece of a Polish villager who was accused in the book by witness testimony of having betrayed Jews to the Germans. In February 2021, a Warsaw court ruled that Grabowski and Engelking must apologize for their claims about the villager, but it did not order them to pay compensation. In response to the court ruling, the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Yad Vashem, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center released statements expressing their concerns about the ruling's effects on academic freedom and freedom of speech. The POLIN Museum stated that the suit had been "an attempt to frighten scholars away from publishing the results of their research out of fear of a lawsuit and the ensuing costly litigation." 
In August 2021, an appeals court overturned that ruling and dismissed the claims against the historians.
Views.
Summary.
In 2016 Grabowski published a paper criticizing what he called "the history policy of the Polish state", and arguing that "the state-sponsored version of history seeks to undo the findings of the last few decades and to forcibly introduce a sanitized, feel-good narrative". He has deplored plans for a monument to rescuers of Jews, to be located at Grzybowski Square, which was part of the wartime Warsaw Ghetto; he sees it as an attempt to inflate the role of the rescuers, whom he describes as a "desperate, hunted, tiny minority", the exception to the rule. The ghetto site should be dedicated, he argues, to Jewish suffering, not to Polish courage.
Poland's embassy in Ottawa criticized Grabowski in 2016 for "groundless opinions and accusations" after he wrote an article for "Maclean's" about Poland's controversial amendment to its Act on the Institute of National Remembrance. The amendment would have penalized, with imprisonment for up to three years, anyone defaming Poland by accusing it of complicity in the Holocaust, with exceptions for "freedom of research, discussion of history, and artistic activity".
In July 2017, Grabowski criticized the Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II, which opened in Markowa in 2016. The garden will have plaques identifying the 1,500 towns in which the nearly 6,700 Poles lived who helped Jews and were recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. In Grabowski's view, the museum should provide more information about the Polish neighbours of the Ulma family and others who aided Jews.
Grabowski co-wrote a "Haaretz" opinion piece in December 2018 criticizing Israeli historian Daniel Blatman, professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, for accepting the post of chief historian at the newly formed Warsaw Ghetto Museum in Warsaw, Poland, and thus agreeing to be "the poster boy of [Polish] state authorities bent on turning back the clock and distorting the history of the Holocaust". In January 2019 Blatman responded in "Haaretz" that, while scholars at the Center for Holocaust Research had provided valuable insights into involvement in the Holocaust by parts of the Polish population, they did not give due weight to the terror and violence perpetrated by the Germans against Poles under German occupation.
Responses.
Since publication of "Hunt for the Jews", Grabowski has become subject to significant criticism in Poland, particularly from groups associated with Polish right-wing spectrum. Some of them attempted to have him fired from his academic position, and he has faced harassment and death threats, leading to increased security patrols in his department at the University of Ottawa.
On 7 June 2017 the Polish League Against Defamation released a statement signed by 134 Polish scientists protesting Grabowski's "false and wrongful image of Poland and Polish people". The statement was sent to the University of Ottawa and to the publishers of his books and articles. It referred to German efforts to exterminate the Polish population, which made its occupation of Poland different from western Europe's occupation; to numerous examples of Poles' assistance to Jews; and to Poland's international protests at the plight of the Jewish population. It alleged that assistance by Poles was often hindered by Jews' low proficiency in Polish, by mistrust created by Jews' affiliation with Soviet authorities, and by Orthodox Jews' mistrust of non-Jews.
In response, the Polish Center for Holocaust Research issued a statement of its own a few days later, entitled "In defence of Jan Grabowski's good name". Signed by seven of its members, including Barbara Engelking, Jacek Leociak and Dariusz Libionka, it called the criticism "as brutal as it is absurd". The Human Rights Research and Education Centre at the University of Ottawa also expressed its full support for Grabowski, referring to his "highly respected scholarship".
On 19 June 2017, some 180 Holocaust historians and other historians of modern European history signed an open letter in Grabowski's defence, addressed to Calin Rovinescu, Chancellor of the University of Ottawa. Describing the campaign against Grabowski as "an attack on academic freedom and integrity", the letter said that "[h]is scholarship holds to the highest standards of academic research and publication", and that the Polish League Against Defamation puts forth a "distorted and whitewashed version of the history of Poland during the Holocaust era". Signatories included Yitzhak Arad, Omer Bartov, Yehuda Bauer, Michael Berenbaum, Doris Bergen, Randolph L. Braham, Richard Breitman, Christopher Browning, Deborah Dwork, Michael Fleming, Mary Fulbrook, Christian Gerlach, Peter Hayes, Deborah Lipstadt, Antony Polonsky, Dina Porat, Alvin H. Rosenfeld and Robert Jan van Pelt. Grabowski filed a lawsuit in Warsaw against the Polish League Against Defamation in November 2018. The suit asked that each of the 134 Polish scientists who signed the 2017 statement buy a copy of "Dalej jest noc" and donate it to a Polish high school.

2019 Prayag Kumbh Mela

The 2019 Prayagraj Ardh Kumbh Mela was the Ardh Kumbh Mela held at Triveni Sangam in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India from 15 January to 4 March 2019.
Governance.
A bill was passed in Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly to set up "Prayagraj Mela Authority", a permanent body to oversee the mela. The divisional commission of Allahabad serves its chairperson while the district magistrate and inspector general of police as the vice-chairpersons. Mela officers and other district officials are also the members of this authority.
Projects.
Around ₹4200 crore will be allotted by the state government for the Ardh Kumbh 2019, over two times more than it had spent on the last Kumbh held in 2013. About 199 projects of 16 government departments are underway under four phases which includes a six-lane bridge over the river Ganga and a four-lane railway over-bridge worth ₹275 crore. The Public Works Department has to execute projects worth ₹430 crore including building an inner ring road in the city. ₹210 crore would be spent on safe drinking water facilities and ₹60 crore to electrify the Kumbh area. Focus is also laid on solid waste management to ensure that Ganga water is not contaminated and putting up LED lights. Moreover, widening and beautification of 18 roads and 25 road crossings is being done with the deadline of October 2018.
Promotion.
The logo of 2019 Kumbh shows a group of Sadhus bathing in the Sangam confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna. The Uttar Pradesh government has decreed that all state government documents, letterheads and publicity material, including advertisements and hoardings, should carry the new logo. Moreover, cinema halls in the state are directed to display the logo straight after the national anthem is played.

George Beaumont (minister)

George Beaumont (fl. 1800–1830) was a British nonconformist minister and controversialist of the Ebenezer Chapel, Norwich. He is known as an early pacifist writer.
Background.
According to an 1836 gazetteer, the Ebenezer Chapel in Norwich's Ber-Street was originally a Baptist meeting-house, and then was used by the Methodist New Connexion. George Beaumont represented Norwich at the New Connexion conferences of 1813 and 1814.
When Beaumont wrote "The warrior's looking glass" of 1808, British pacifists, outside of the Society of Friends, were isolated. An article in the "Monthly Repository" in 1809, taking a cue from the recent abolition of the slave trade of 1807, and Thomas Clarkson's 1808 book on it, speculated on the abolition of war (attribution by Ceadel of a letter from "J. H." is to John Holland (1766–1826)). Also in 1809, in the "Monthly Magazine", "H. W." (Henry Wansey, of Unitarian views) called for a peace association.
David Bogue's "first clear call to form an organization on a pacifist basis" came in 1813. Beaumont was a subscriber to the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace in 1817.

Jubilee Clock Tower, Weymouth

The Jubilee Clock Tower is a free-standing clock tower on the Esplanade of Weymouth, Dorset, England. It was built and erected in 1888 to commemorate the Golden jubilee of Queen Victoria and became Grade II Listed in 1974. Historic England described the clock as being a "florid but characteristic enrichment to the sea-front" and "boldy coloured". It is built of cast and wrought-iron and set on a Portland stone base.
History.
Weymouth's Jubilee Clock Tower was built to commemorate Queen Victoria's 50 years of reign in 1887. The tower was paid for by public subscription, with £100 having been collected during celebrations on Her Majesty's Jubilee day of 21 June 1887. The Jubilee Committee then approached the council with the idea for the clock tower, which was readily accepted. As fundraising did not reach enough to provide the clock itself, Sir Henry Edwards donated one, while the gas company agreed to keep the clock illuminated for free in perpetuity. Weymouth Corporation provided the stone base.
The clock tower was unveiled on 31 October 1888. Erected on Weymouth's esplanade, it was set in front of the esplanade slightly projecting onto the sands of Weymouth Beach. In the 1920s, the esplanade was extended around it to protect the beach from the encroachment of shingle from the eastern end, and to provide more promenade space on the seaward side. The clock tower itself was not moved. The clock tower was also painted in bright colours during the same decade.

Judenjagd

Judenjagd (German: “Hunt for Jews”) were German-conducted searches, beginning in 1942, for Jews who were in hiding in German-occupied Poland. The term was introduced by Christopher R. Browning. Targeted in the searches were Jews concealed among the Polish gentile population or in the forests—generally escapees from ghetto liquidations and deportations to Nazi concentration camps. 
Germans' victims.
By some estimates, in these circumstances, as many as 200,000 Jews may have been killed, may have died of starvation or exposure, or may have been delivered to the Germans. From October 1941, persons helping Jews in occupied Poland were punished by the Germans with the death penalty. 
In 2018 Tomasz Frydel reviewed and reassessed the "perpetrator role" of ordinary Poles, discussed in Jan Grabowski's book, "Hunt for the Jews". Frydel described the whole Nazi German terror system that was directed not only against Jews but against non-Jewish Poles, including the Polish underground, Soviet prisoners of war, Roma, and others. German police in occupied Poland used sting operations, sometimes employing Jews, to find and kill rescuers of the Germans' quarries.

Express Entry

Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage Canadian permanent residence applications for filling labour gaps through certain economic immigration programs. Launched on 1 January 2015, this immigration system is used to select and communicate with skilled and qualified applicants, it also manages a pool of immigration ready skilled workers. Express Entry is designed to facilitate express immigration of skilled workers to Canada "who are most likely to succeed economically." The system is identified to be efficient in processing times, with 80% of applications processed in 6 months or less compared to an existing one.
Those who are eligible for one of the programs managed by Express Entry submit their application and the Canadian government issues invitation letters to successful candidates per a score system. Acceptance of the invitation and positive assessment of the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada on the application will grant the applicant, and their accompanying family members, Canadian permanent resident status.
Economic value versus "first-come first-served".
Express Entry replaced the original "first-come first-served" immigration selection system. Express Entry was expected to be more responsive to regional labour shortages. It systemically favours qualified immigrants by prioritising such individuals and avoids the arbitrary selections of the previous system which, in some cases, were based on a first-come, first-served basis. 
Express Entry uses a points-based system, called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), to automatically rank interested candidates and select the most competitive for immigration. The core factors considered are age, level of education, language proficiency in English and/or French, and Canadian work experience. An ideal candidate would be between the age of 20–29, possessing a high level of education, and advanced proficiency in either English or French.
Concerns have also been expressed about the Express Entry system. Morton Beiser and Harald Bauder (2014) of Ryerson University wrote "Canada’s once pathbreaking immigration policies are being transformed into a system that mainly serves employers, treating immigrants not as future citizens or members of Canadian communities and families but merely as convenient or cheap labour." Others fear that Express Entry gives too much power to politicians and bureaucrats. Advocates of Express Entry claim that it can reduce the number of migrants who fail to get work by better fitting immigrants to existing jobs vacancies.
The system.
The Canadian government establishes its own annual quota for new immigrants. Under its 2020-2022 Immigration Levels Plan, Canada is targeting the arrival of 91,800 immigrants through Express Entry in 2020. It has set a target of an additional 91,150 arrivals in 2021, and 91,150 in 2022.
Approximately every two weeks, the Canadian government conducts an Express Entry draw, inviting the most competitive Express Entry candidates to apply for Canadian permanent resident status. In these draws, the federal government establishes a cut-off score, using the Comprehensive Ranking System. All candidates with scores higher than the cut-off will receive an official Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency. The lowest CRS score ever recorded for The Federal Skilled Trades Class was 199 in May 2017. In 2020, the lowest CRS score for applicants was 415 out of 1,200. If multiple applicants have the same CRS score, the system sorts the applications by the date and time the applicant's profile was submitted to the system. On rare occasions, the government may limit the draws to specific Express Entry immigration programs.
In 2019, the Canadian government issued 85,300 ITAs. Some 45% of these ITAs were issued to Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) candidates, 36% went to Canadian Experience Class (CEC) candidates, 18% went to Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) candidates, and 1% went to Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) candidates.
In 2020, 107,350 further ITAs were issued to Express Entry candidates.
All applications are processed under the "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act" (IRPA) and go through the following stages:

Critical response.
"Go Go Squid!" received an average rating of 6.6/10 at Douban, and 7.8/10 at IMDb. For Li Xian's performance, the audience generally praised his acting skills online, but the lines were a little bit procrastinated, such as saying that the lines seemed to contain something, and the lines were too slow. In this regard, Li Xian admitted that the rhythm of his speech is a bit slow, and it was specially designed for the character after communicating with the filming team. Despite this, Li Xian still admitted that he did feel the shortcomings of his lines when watching the drama. Liu Wei of The Beijing News praised the plot setting, which is different from the past youth romance dramas. The love of "Go Go Squid!" expresses delicate and true emotions, conveys the positive energy of sunshine and youth, and does not add some sad links in the plot setting. There are not too many "dog blood" plots in the other sidelines, and there are no male second silently waiting, female second spoiler and bad mother-in-law who break up the couple. In addition, Jia Miao of Oriental Network also praised the positive energy of the series, the way it tells all aspects of young people's lives in a simple but peaceful way, and the small details which inadvertently touched the audience. She is even looking forward to more urban positive energy TV shows like "Go Go Squid!."
Lili Pang of Oriental Network also praised the actors for their vivid interpretation of the characters, especially Li's performance, writing "I feel that Li Xian is still a very promising boy. In this drama, due to the role setting, there is no big explosion and no famous scenes, but Li Xian's performance is still excellent. I feel that this person can handle more complicated and deep roles." People's Daily praised the writer for the setting of the characters which is different from another youth theme drama, and also praised the plot's precise outline and meticulous description that showed the young people's living conditions and mental outlook, as well as actively contacts the frontier areas of concern for the current young audience.
Release.
Broadcast.
The series premiered from July 9, 2019 until July 31, 2019, and was broadcast simultaneously on Zhejiang TV, Dragon TV, iQiyi, and Tencent. Released on Netflix in February 2020, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Malaysia through We TV, other countries on Rakuten Viki, My Dramalist, as well as YouTube.
Controversy.
When the play was broadcast, a full collection of resources unexpectedly appeared online, and many unbroadcast plots were leaked in advance. Because the watermark of the leaked film reads "Only for viewing by Dragon TV ", netizens left a message in the official Weibo of Dragon TV, but Dragon TV has not responded.
The series was embroiled in a controversy after a map was seen in episode 39 that left off the self-ruled island of Taiwan and southern Hainan, and incorrectly represented the India-Tibet border, the South China Sea and the Kashmir region. According to the ministry, mistakes on the map used in the teleplay include that it incorrectly delineated the boundaries of the southern areas of the Tibet autonomous region, the colors for Taiwan and Hainan islands were different from other parts of China; and the dotted line to indicate Chinese islands in the South China Sea was missing. The issue has since been investigated by China's Ministry of Natural Resources. On August 12, the production company was fined RMB 100,000 (US$14,100) by Shanghai Municipality Planning and Natural Resources Bureau.
Soundtrack.
"The Unknown Generation" is the theme song of the drama. The wind echoes the plot very much. In addition to telling love stories between couples, the TV series also tells a group of young people working hard for seemingly unremarkable dreams, occupations, and hobbies. Compared with national athletes and international superstars, e-sports players may be "unknown people," but this group of young people choose to ignore everyone's colored vision, insist on pursuing their dreams, and win glory for the country. The songs are composed by Tang Hanxiao.
"Couldn't Leave" is the only English episode, sung by a Kazakh male singer, Dimash. The lyrics are simple, but the love is profound. "So many times I wish I could leave", tells that someone in the play wants to give up, but because of a kind of power (in the play is a group of brothers working hard together), that person persevered. The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried.
Songs expressing love include "Milk Bread" and "Happiness Walking Together".
"Milk Bread," sung by Yang Zi, peak at 2 on Billboard China Social Chart. Li also participated in the soundtrack title "For the Future (Gei Wei Lai)". The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent. Even when it comes to the climax in the play or song, it expresses everything with a calm and mature character. In the middle part of the song is a child's voice. The song peak at 7 on Billboard China Social Chart and Billboard China Top 100.

Charles Octavius Boothe (13 June 1845 – 1924) was an African American Baptist preacher and educator. He also helped establish the Colored Baptist Missionary Convention of the State of Alabama.
Biography.
Boothe was born into slavery on June 13, 1845, in Mobile County, Alabama. He encountered Christianity at a young age, witnessing white and African Americans worshipping together in a local Baptist church. However, he only converted to Christianity after the end of the Civil War, baptized in 1866 and ordained a minister in 1868.
Boothe was strongly concerned with the "uplift" of African Americans, attempting to offer basic literacy and religious and moral education. This included providing the resources necessary to improve the status of African Americans in American society. He helped establish the Colored Baptist Missionary Convention of the State of Alabama in the early 1870s, as a ministerial alliance of Black Baptist churches. He also published a number of resources, such as "Plain Theology for Plain People" (1890), in order to articulate "the doctrines of our holy religion" with "simplicity of arrangement and simplicity of language."
Eventually retiring from his work in the 1900s, Boothe died in 1924 in Detroit, Michigan.

Adolfo Barberis

Adolfo Barberis (1 June 1884 - 24 September 1967) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and the founder of the Sisters of Christian Servanthood. Barberis served as the assistant to the Archbishop of Turin from 1906 until the cardinal's death in 1923 at which point he worked for sometime as a professor. He did this while managing the functions of the religious congregation he established which he had dedicated to the education and care of domestic women. The consequences of World War I were enough to convince him to found an order to help women though he often faced difficulties in dealing with Cardinal Maurilio Fossati in the beginning of the latter's tenure as Archbishop of Turin. These disagreements came due to Fossati's limited knowledge of Barberis' work and the slander levelled against him sometime before that. This slander came in 1923 after his cardinal benefactor died as some fellow priests suggested he garnered too much power in his position.
Barberis nonetheless was rehabilitated towards the end of his life when his good friend Cardinal Michele Pellegrino dispelled the allegations levelled against him. Health concerns plagued him towards the rest of his life and he retired to the order's motherhouse where he later died from his ailments.
The beatification process launched in Turin in 1995 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The process culminated in 2014 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable.
Life.
Adolfo Barberis was born in Turin on 1 June 1884 as the second of four children to the Novara-born dentist Carlo Barberis and Teresa Chione di Caluso. He had one sister (who preceded him) Clelia and two successive brothers after him named Giacomo and Carlo. His mother was pious and gentle while his father was often brash and abrasive with little tenderness for his children. Barberis was baptized at Pentecost on 7 June 1884 in the parish church of Santa Giulia (a church the baroness Venerable Juliette Colbert de Barolo established) in the Vanchiglia village. The Barberis's later moved in the same village closer to the parish of San Tommaso Apostolo which was under the governance of the Order of Friars Minor who prepared Barberis for his First Communion on 27 April 1893 and his Confirmation less than a month later.
Barberis studied for the priesthood in the seminaries in Turin (1895-1900) and then in Giaveno where he received the clerical dress on 15 August 1900 from the curate of San Carlo. He studied also in Chieri from 1900 to 1902 for philosophical studies and then underwent his theological studies from 1902 to 1907.
He received his ordination to the priesthood on 29 June 1907 in the metropolitan cathedral from the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Agostino Richelmy who had appointed him as his personal assistant months prior in 1906. He celebrated his first Mass on 30 June 1907 in the San Carlo church. Barberis founded a college hostel for students around this time and became invested in diocesan pilgrimages to Lourdes. But he soon harbored desires to join the missions and to join the Consolata Missionaries. But Cardinal Richelmy dissuaded him from doing this. But this did not prevent him from 1907 to 1909 going to the Consolata Missionaries' convent to receive spiritual direction from the two brothers Blessed Giovanni Maria Boccardo and Blessed Luigi Boccardo. In his role as the cardinal's aide he accompanied his benefactor and patron to the papal conclave in 1914 and the conclave in 1922. The cardinal had complete trust and confidence in Barberis which frustrated his colleagues who believed that he had too much influence and power.
Barberis had a passion for sacred art and was appointed to oversee the education of seminarians in sacred art once Pope Pius X - in 1910-11 - ordered that seminaries teach it. He paid particular attention to the needs of domestic women and saw the consequences of World War I on them. He set himself on the establishment of a religious congregation that would render aid to them as well as both oversee their education and instil moral values in them. The social degradation and poor jobs available to women also motivated him to found an order which was something that Cardinal Richelmy encouraged him to do. He founded in 1921 the Sisters of Christian Servanthood. The Bishop of Ivrea Paolo Rostagno would later provide diocesan approval for his order on 8 December 1953. The cardinal died due to illness in 1923 (he tended to him in his final illness) and Barberis was appointed as a professor before being made a parish priest and then a hospital chaplain. But the cardinal's death also prompted his fellow priests to isolate him since those priests believed that Barberis had too much influence and power in archdiocesan duties. In April 1924 he left the episcopal palace to begin his professorship in addition to his duties with his religious order. Richelmy's successor Cardinal Giuseppe Gamba liked Barberis and it was he who appointed him as a professor. It was at some stage that Barberis helped the poor Giuseppe Garneri begin his ecclesial studies; Garneri would later become the Bishop of Susa. Cardinal Maurilio Fossati later became the Archbishop of Turin and both he and Barberis had an initial tense relationship since Fossati did not quite understand Barberis's work. This later was dispelled and the two soon collaborated with each other. It was at some stage that he became friends with the Venerable Giuseppina Operti. He was also good friends with the Archbishop of Turin Michele Pellegrino who helped Barberis dispel all slanderous allegations that had been made against him decades prior. Barberis's order was later aggregated to the Conventual Franciscans on 2 August 1955.
His health declined over time to the point where he had to have several operations including one to remove a tumor in 1958. He had one for prostate cancer and two for bowel cancer. He suffered a collapse in 1961 and suffered a cardiac crisis just months before he died. Barberis died during the evening on 24 September 1967 in the order's house in Turin at Via Lomellina. His remains are located in the order's motherhouse in Turin. His order expanded to Mexico and Columbia and as of 2005 had 50 religious in a total of nine houses.
Beatification process.
The beatification process was launched in Turin in a diocesan investigation to assess his life and virtues; this process spanned from its opening on 8 February 1995 until its formal closure on 4 July 1998. But the formal introduction to the cause came on 13 March 1995 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled him as a Servant of God and declared "nihil obstat" (no objections) to the cause. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan investigation on 26 February 1999 and received the Positio dossier in 2001 for evaluation.
Theologians were unanimous in their approval of the cause on 15 January 2013 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. were also unanimous in their approval of the cause on 4 March 2014. Barberis was named as Venerable on 3 April 2014 after Pope Francis confirmed that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue.
The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Flavio Peloso.

Jewish Museum of Hohenems

The Jewish Museum Hohenems (German: "Jüdisches Museum Hohenems", abbreviation JMH) is a regional museum in Hohenems in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg. The museum deals with the Jewish presence in Hohenems as well as surrounding regions. It also covers the Diaspora and Israel and puts the future of the European immigration society into focus.
The destruction of the Jewish community of Hohenems via expulsion and deportation – see "Antisemitism in Austria" – and the Shoah are one of the museum's main topics. Besides the regional and global history, the museum is dedicated to the Jews and their stories. Each year, the museum offers a different temporary exhibition and an extensive event program.
Since there is no longer a Jewish community in Hohenems, the museum's imparting of knowledge and communication must largely be made by non-Jews.
The building.
The Jewish Museum Hohenems was opened in April 1991 and is housed in the Villa Heimann-Rosenthal in the heart of the former Jewish quarter. The villa of the Rosenthal family dates back to 1864 and can – now that it hosts the JMH – be perceived as an exhibit itself.
History of the Jewish community in Hohenems.
In order to economically incentivise the small market town of Hohenems, Count Kaspar created the legal basis for the settlement of Jewish families in 1617. His goal was to make Hohenems' economy flourish through Jewish traders, servants, merchants and craftsmen. The rich community established a synagogue, a school, a care centre for the elderly and poor, and a mikveh. Demographically, the community reached their peak the first half of the 19th century and became a hub of their own Diaspora in and around the Alps, in Southern, Middle and Western Europe and in the US.
Due to the Austrian constitution of 1867, Jewish citizens were allowed to choose their place of residence freely. The Swiss constitution of 1866 granted them similar rights, so many members of the Jewish community of Hohenems decided to migrate to larger cities in Austria and Switzerland. By 1935, there were 16 Jewish citizens left in Hohenems. This small group was expropriated by the municipality in 1938 as a consequence of the Nazi regime. In 1940, the remaining Jewish citizens of Hohenems were dispersed by force. Some of them were deported to Vienna and later put into concentration camps in Eastern Europe. Some survivors of the concentration camps (so-called Displaced Persons) were accommodated in Hohenems by French occupying forces after the war.
Exhibitions.
The permanent exhibition "From the Middle Ages to the Present" was completely redesigned in 2007. It focuses on the Jewish community from its beginnings in the 17th century to the end after 1938, putting Jewish people and their personal lives in the centre of attention. In addition, there is an exhibition for children.
Since the opening of the museum, a large collection of everyday objects and personal documents has been created in cooperation with the descendants of Jews from Hohenems all over the world and through multiple donations.

Die Höchste Eisenbahn

Die Höchste Eisenbahn is a German band from Berlin, consisting amongst others of the singer-songwriters Francesco Wilking and Moritz Krämer.
History.
The Singer-Songwriter – singer of the band Tele (band) – and Moritz Krämer planned a joint gig in Dresden. After more gigs they created the band project "Die Höchste Eisenbahn." The name was chosen because Wilking liked the picture of a "train driving like on stilts". In colloquial German in Berlin something being "höchste Eisenbahn" indicates that it is urgent.
For a tour in fall 2012 they were joined by musicians Max Schröder (Tomte (band), Olli Schulz) and Felix Weigt and they became part of the band. The first EP "Unzufrieden" was released on 14 September 2012 by Tapete Records. The debut album "Schau in den Lauf, Hase" was released on 8 November 2013. The second album "Wer bringt mich jetzt zu den Anderen" was released on 26 August 2016.

Wildwood Kin

Wildwood Kin are an English contemporary family alt folk trio, composed of sisters Beth Key and Emillie Whiteside and their cousin Meghann Loney, from Exeter, Devon, England. They released their first album "Turning Tides" in August 2017. They released their self-titled second album in October 2019, featuring the smash hit “Beauty In Your Brokenness", a song inspired by the Japanese art of Kintsugi. Wildwood Kin appeared on Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch in September 2019.
Career.
Before they officially formed as a band, Beth, Emillie, Meghann would harmonise to everything that was in earshot, from songs on the radio, TV jingles, adverts to even the doorbell. They soon found their signature style with Emillie playing guitar, Beth playing the bouzouki or keyboard, and Meghann playing the drums. They all join forces for harmonies and take turns on lead vocals. The band credit musical influences such as Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac and James Taylor, as well as newer acts such as Mumford &amp; Sons, Ben Howard, Fleet Foxes, Sigur Ros and The Civil Wars.
They played their first gig at an open mic night at Stokeinteignhead’s Church House Inn to around 60 people. This was where they caught the attention of their future management. Their career then developed quickly and in 2017 they released their debut album, "Turning Tides", via Sony Music's imprint label Silvertone. The band spent much of 2017 touring playing a number of UK and European festivals over the summer, including an appearance with Seth Lakeman at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park and on the BBC Music Introducing Stage at Glastonbury.
In describing the band, The Sunday Times noted "Fleetwood Mac-like harmonies, hints of Fleet Foxes’ desolate, spectral acoustica, echoes of Ben Howard’s richly textured but ramshackle sparseness, a love of Mumford-like propulsion and explosiveness."
In 2018, they performed their single "Steady My Heart" on the one-off revival special of "The Old Grey Whistle Test" with Bob Harris.
In July, 2019 they announced their second, self-titled album, alongside lead single "Never Alone", written with and produced by Ed Harcourt. The rest of the album, produced by Ian Grimble, addresses profound themes like love, loss and spirituality. After a UK headline tour to support the album release, Wildwood Kin toured through Europe with the acclaimed indie rock-folk band Boy &amp; Bear.

Battle of Novhorod-Siverskyi

The Battle of Novgorod-Seversky was the first major battle of False Dmitry I against Boris Godunov.
Prelude.
False Dmitry I crossed the border of the Tsardom of Russia in winter of 1604 commanding a mercenary army of Polish-Lithuanian noblemen. Many residents of southern Russian lands flocked to his banner, and the fortified cities of Chernigov and Putyvl accepted him as their "rightful sovereign".
Siege of Novgorod Seversky.
Novgorod Seversky was the only city that resisted False Dmitry's troops, defended by Voivode Peter Basmanov and Nikita Trubetskoi with 1,500 men and several heavy cannon. The siege began on November 21, but two major assaults were successfully repulsed.
Battle.
Nevertheless, the army of the impostor continued to grow to about 15.000, as new towns and cities recognized his authority. To help Basmanov, Tsar Boris Godunov sent some 25.000 servicemen (probably 40.000 including armed serfs) under Prince Fyodor Mstislavsky. But False Dmitry I took the initiative and attacked the larger Russian army on December 31, 1604, on the outskirts of the city. Polish Hussars, led personally by the impostor, routed the right wing of the Russian army, put the center in a disarray, and wounded Prince Mstislavsky himself. The Prince was saved by a counter-attack of Streltsy under Mikhail Shein, and the Russian army retreated to their fortified camp.
Aftermath.
The Tsar's army quickly recovered and defeated the usurper in the Battle of Dobrynichi in January 1605.

Jesús Rojas (Puerto Rican boxer)

Jesus Manuel Rojas Diaz (born December 26, 1986 in Caguas, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican boxer who is the former WBA (Regular) featherweight champion.
Professional career.
After turning professional in 2006 Rojas amassed a record of 25-1-2-1 in 11 years before challenging and beating Dominican Claudio Marrero for the interim WBA featherweight title. 
In July 2018 the World Boxing Association announced that Rojas has been upgraded to 'Regular champion' and that he will be making his first defense against Mexican American boxer Joseph Diaz. Diaz however, came into the fight overweight, missing the required weight limit by 0.6 pounds. According to WBA rules, this meant that Rojas gets to keep his title regardless of the outcome of the fight. Diaz would end up handing Rojas his first defeat in 10 years, by a 12-round unanimous decision.
In a fight deemed an early "fight of the year" candidate, Rojas was defending his WBA title against Chinese star and WBA #2 at featherweight Can Xu. Xu edged out Rojas in a highly controversial unanimous decision. The official scorecards, 118-110, 117-111, and 116-112 were in wide favor of Xu, even though the punch output from Rojas suggested that the fight was much closer than that.

Michael Clark (artist)

Michael Clark (born 1 April 1954) is a contemporary British artist. His work spans a broad range of media including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, photography, installation, video, performance and artist's books. Clark was born in Manchester and lives and works in London.
Life and work.
In 1977 Clark met Muriel Belcher and Francis Bacon in The Colony Room club in Soho. Clark's portrait of Belcher on her deathbed ("Muriel Belcher Ill in bed") was part of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1981, and won the Charles Wollaston Award. At the suggestion of Valerie Beston, of Marlborough Fine Art, Clark made the first of a series of portraits of Bacon, one of which is in the British Museum's collection. "Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality".
"Vanitas" (1990-1992), Clark's double-sided portrait of Lisa Stansfield, was part of "The Portrait Now" exhibition held from 1993–1994 at the National Portrait Gallery. "Both the theme of the wound and the title 'Vanitas' make references to mortality. Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting — also double-sided — by Barthel Bruyn the Elder." Since 1994, Clark's "Five Wounds" have been on permanent display at Chichester Cathedral, alongside works by Graham Sutherland, John Piper and Marc Chagall."In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'"Maria Balshaw, director of the Tate, listed Clark's portrait of filmmaker Derek Jarman, "The Gardener" (1994), as one of her favourite works in the collection of the Whitworth Art Gallery. “Michael Clark drew the film-maker towards the end of his life, when he was a man facing sickness and death. The drawing has a distinct and immediate impact, foregrounding as it does the quality of personal courage of the sitter. You are powerfully drawn to the face, you have a sense that the sitter trusted the artist to see into the eyes, to do much more than observe …” After purchasing "Seer" (1993), a grisaille portrait of Derek Jarman, in 1995, the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Clark, in 1999, to make a portrait of the filmmaker Nicolas Roeg. Clark delivered "Al-Jebr", a kinetic assemblage made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'.
The art collection of Valerie Beston was sold at Christie's in February 2006 and included ten works by Clark. The accompanying catalogue stated:"Bacon’s influence threads through his [Clark's] works, reappearing even in his conceptual pieces. Be it in the appearance of wounds in his paintings, or in the location of a ‘sound sculpture’ outside a sex shop that Bacon used to frequent (only in part to cash his cheques), his ghostly spectre appears again and again, if only obliquely, in his figurative and conceptual works. For Clark is not a portraitist, although he has created many portraits of people ranging from film directors to the characters of Soho of yesterday to Royalty to Pop royalty. He is a conceptual artist, for whom the painstakingly accurate depiction of the human face is only one of his means or media, and conversation with him ranges from the diverse influences of Rimbaud and Nauman as well as Holbein and Rembrandt."
In his book, "Francis Bacon in Your Blood," art historian Michael Peppiatt writes:
"A feature article came out a while ago in the "Observer" in which the author, Peter Conrad, interviewed three men who had been close to Francis Bacon in their youth. He described each of them as having been 'burnt' for life by their contact with the painter. The implication was that you did not survive the influence of a genius as dark and powerful as Bacon. The three men were the photographer Peter Beard, the artist Michael Clark, and myself."

Marley Brown Oval

Marley Brown Oval is a playing field located in the suburb of Clinton in the regional Queensland city of Gladstone. The field was named in honour of local rugby league identity Marley Brown who had died a year before the venue opened, with the first rugby league game played at Marley Brown Oval in 1976.
The Gladstone Leagues Club located at the ground opened in 1988, and a 1000-seat grandstand was constructed in 1995.
In 2017, it was announced Marley Brown Oval would benefit from state government funding, as part of the Works 4 Queensland program. The funding will be used to expand the amenities, make it more inclusive for female rugby league players and upgrade the venue to an NRL standard.
Marley Brown Oval was chosen to host its first NRL game in April 2018. The decision to host an NRL game in Gladstone came about due to the Gold Coast Titans needing to temporarily relocate their home games, including the Round 5 match against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, due to the 2018 Commonwealth Games being held on the Gold Coast.
Queensland Country hosted at Marley Brown Oval for the National Rugby Championship annual City-Country match in September 2019.

The Transposed Heads (opera)

The Transposed Heads is an opera in one act with six scenes composed by Peggy Glanville-Hicks. She also wrote the libretto which was adapted from Lowe-Porter's English translation of Thomas Mann's novella, "Die vertauschten Köpfe". It was a commission from the Louisville Philharmonic Society and premiered on 3 April 1954 at the Columbia Auditorium in Louisville, Kentucky.
Set in India, the story centers on the love triangle between Sita, her husband Shridaman, and Shridaman's friend Nanda. During a fraught episode in a temple to Kali, each of the male protagonists beheads himself. Kali brings them back to life but with the heads on the wrong bodies. Living with the mix-up ultimately results in Shridaman and Nanda committing suicide again and Sita throwing herself on their joint funeral pyre.
Background.
"The Transposed Heads" was Glanville-Hicks's first attempt at a full length opera. It was the result of a $4000 commission from the Louisville Philharmonic Society with extra funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. She wrote the libretto herself, by her own admission basing it virtually verbatim on Lowe-Porter's English translation of Thomas Mann's 1940 novella, "Die vertauschten Köpfe". However, she shortened it considerably and eliminated some elements of the plot. Despite the ostensibly tragic nature of Mann's story, he told it in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Glanville-Hicks retained some of that element by making the guru Kamadamana and the goddess Kali comic figures and giving them speaking rather than singing roles.
Glanville-Hicks wrote in the programme notes for the premiere:
It was my aim to create a grand opera on a chamber music scale. The work is essentially a virtuoso piece for singers, the whole form and pacing coming from the vocal element as does the shape of a Baroque concerto from the vocal elaboration.
The score incorporates music from her 1935 "Sinfonietta for Small Orchestra in D Minor" and from Indian folk sources. According to Glanville-Hicks the use of Indian musical motifs did not require a significant change in her usual mode of composition:
Over a period of years I have gradually shed the harmonic dictatorship peculiar to modernists, and have evolved a melody-rhythm structure that comes very close to the musical patterns of the ancient world.
She composed the score over a period of four months, completing it in September 1953 in Port Antonio, Jamaica. While she was looking for a permanent summer house there, Errol Flynn's father Theodore let her use his son's yacht "Zaca" for her composing. During that time Glanville-Hicks and Theodore Flynn became lovers, and she dedicated "The Transposed Heads" to him. In the course of the opera's development, she had vacillated between structures of one, two, or three acts. She eventually settled on one act with six scenes. The total running time of the opera without intermissions is approximately 75 minutes.
Performance history.
"The Transposed Heads" premiered in a matinee performance at the Columbia Auditorium in Louisville, Kentucky on 3 April 1954 conducted by Moritz von Bomhard. It had a run of three performances ending on 24 April. The opera was also recorded by the Louisville Philharmonic Society and released on an LP which was subsequently played on radio stations across the United States. Its New York premiere came in 1958 in a production conducted by Carlos Surinach at the Phoenix Theatre where it ran for two performances under the auspices of the Contemporary Music Society. In his review of the New York premiere Howard Taubman wrote:
She [Glanville-Hicks] sets English well, and she writes attractively for the voice. But her Orientalisms become repetitious and bare before one is done with them, and this is a short opera."
In 1970, "The Transposed Heads" became the first major work of Glanville-Hicks to be premiered in her native Australia when it was performed by the University of New South Wales opera. It was staged again in 1986 at the Australian Festival when it was presented in a double-bill with her 1959 one-act opera "The Glittering Gate".
Synopsis.
Setting: Rural India in mythical times
Scene 1
Shridaman is a learned merchant with a noble face but a thin, weedy body. Nanda is a blacksmith with a strong and beautiful body but a rather ordinary intellect. Despite these differences, they are both friends. While out in the forest, they observe the beautiful Sita taking a ritual bath. Both are immediately smitten.
Scene 2
Several days later, Nanda finds Shridaman literally sick with love for Sita and despairing that she will ever marry him. Nanda volunteers to woo her on Shridaman's behalf and is successful.
Scene 3
Shridaman and Sita's wedding is celebrated in her village with much singing and dancing.
Scene 4
Shridaman, Sita, and Nanda journey home together after the wedding. Shridaman has noticed that Sita and Nanda have a strong attraction to each other. As they are passing through the forest, they come upon a temple to the goddess Kali. Shridaman goes inside to pray. In a fit of religious fervor he beheads himself to free Sita to marry Nanda. Nanda then enters the temple, and when he finds Shridaman's corpse, he realizes the motive for his friend's suicide. Overcome with remorse, Nanda likewise beheads himself.
Sita enters the temple and on discovering what has happened is about to hang herself. Kali appears. She tells Sita to place the heads back on the bodies and she will bring them both back to life. However, in her grief and agitation Sita places Nanda's head on Shridaman's body and vice versa. After Kali works her magic, each man now finds himself with his original head and identity but a new body.
Scene 5
At first the men profess to be happy with the new arrangement. Nevertheless, they decide to consult the guru Kamadamana as to which of the two men is actually her husband. Kamadamana determines that it is the one with the head of Shridaman. In his disappointment, Nanda becomes a religious recluse.
Scene 6
Several years have passed. Sita is pining for Nanda and seeks him out in his hermitage. Shridaman follows her there and confronts them. He proposes the only solution for a situation where a woman is simultaneously in love with one man's body and another man's head. They must "merge their separate essences in the universal whole." The two men commit suicide by simultaneously stabbing each other in the heart. Sita throws herself on the men's joint funeral pyre.

Rodney G. Hart House

The Rodney G. Hart House is a single-family home located at 244 W. Park Street in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The Rodney G. Hart House reflects the period of strong economic development following the arrival of Lapeer's first railroad in 1871, and utilizes to the fullest the money, materials, and manpower that could so richly interpret the popular Queen Anne styles.
History.
In 1890, this house was built for Rodney G. Hart. Mr. Hart was born in 1831, and was the first child born in the city of Lapeer. His father, Alvin N. Hart, was one of the first settlers of Lapeer, and more importantly is responsible for the construction of the historic Lapeer County Courthouse. Rodney Hart
pursued a number of business ventures in the Lapeer area. He was Lapeer's third mayor, constructed the first grain elevator in Lapeer, served as postmaster, and was involved in banking, farming and stockbreeding. Naturally, this adventurous man was responsible for bringing the first automobile to Lapeer from Chicago in the Spring of 1901. 
Description.
The Rodney G. Hart House is an ample, elegant Queen Anne residence executed in brick, stone, and wood. This house is a two-story, brick, Queen Anne structure built on a stone foundation. Its front entryway is oriented in the corner, facing the intersection of Park and Cedar Streets. The entry porch at this corner is approached via a corner stair, and sits on an arched stone foundation and wraps around both adjacent facades. A three-story square brick tower is located above, and is capped by a domed hip roof. Gable roofs flank the tower with decoratively shingled gable ends. The windows are double-hung, one-over-one units, and the main facade has chamfered corners where the second-floor windows are accented with hoods and large brackets.

Queen Hyeondeok

Queen Hyeondeok (현덕왕후; 17 April 1418 - 10 August 1441), of the Andong Gwon clan, was the primary consort of Crown Prince Yi Hyang. She died giving birth to the future Danjong of Joseon and was posthumously honoured as Queen Hyeondeok (현덕왕후) in 1450, later demoted by Sejo of Joseon after he deposed her son, then restored by Seongjong of Joseon.
Biography.
Lady Gwon was born on 17 April 1418 into the Andong Gwon clan to Gwon Jeon and his second wife, Lady Choi of the Haeju Choi clan. She had a five younger siblings.
At the age of 12-13, Lady Gwon entered the palace in 1431 alongside two other women, Lady Jang and Lady Hong. All were granted the 4th rank of "seunghwi" consort (). She gave birth to a daughter in 1433, but she died before she reached the age of one.
In 1435, Consort Gwon became pregnant, which drew the jealously of Crown Princess Sun, who had no children and feared that she would be removed in favor of Gwon. She later gave birth to Princess Gyeonghye in 1436. After Crown Princess Sun was banished for sleeping with her maid, officials suggested that Kwon be made the next crown princess, as she already had a child, was older than Lady Hong, and her father's government position was high. She was made Crown Princess Gwon late in 1437.
On 9 August 1441, Crown Princess Gwon gave birth to a son named Yi Hong-wi, which was much celebrated, as he was the crown prince's only son. However, Gwon did not recover from the birth and died a day later. She was granted the posthumous title of Crown Princess Consort Hyeondeok () and buried at Soreung () in Ansan, Gyeonggi. It was said that her death had deeply saddened her husband and father-in-law, as well as those who lived and worked in the palace.
Sejong stated that the crown princess had graceful virtues and was admirable, compassionate, and dignified.
Posthumous status.
When Munjong of Joseon ascended the throne, he granted his wife the title of Queen Hyeondeok. Her son later bestowed a full posthumous name during his reign.
In 1457, several years after Sejo of Joseon had deposed her son as king, Queen Hyeondeok's brother and his mother-in-law were found guilty of treason and executed. Both the queen and her father were posthumously demoted to commoner status. 
In a book of unofficial history, Yeonryeosilkisul, it was said that King Sejo had felt the revenge of the deceased Queen Hyeondeok. ‘"One day, Sejo had a dream of Queen Hyeondeok, who appeared in full wrath and said, “You killed my son who did nothing wrong, so I will do the same to your children. Remember that.” Sejo woke up in shock and suddenly, he received the news that the Crown Prince (Sejo’s firstborn son Crown Prince Uigyeong) had passed away. Because of that reason, Soreung (Queen Hyeondeok’s tomb) was dug up".’
Her status was later restored during King Jungjong’s reign and her remains were moved to Hyeonreung to be buried alongside Munjong of Joseon.

Jimi Hendrix's unfinished fourth studio album

Jimi Hendrix intended to release his fourth studio album as a double or triple LP before Christmas 1970. From June to August 1970, he made good progress on the realization of the planned album in his new Electric Lady Studios. Many songs were mixed on 20, 22 and 24 August. Four of these mixes were regarded as definitive versions and were presented at the opening party of Electric Lady on 26 August. Hendrix died on 18 September, leaving behind an enormous number of unreleased recordings in various stages of completion. It is impossible to know what Hendrix would have changed and what he actually would have released, but there is some documentation of the album configurations he had in mind. While a good part of the designated tracks only needed some finishing touches, others only existed as rough recordings and for some titles no recordings are known at all. "The Cry of Love" (1971), "Voodoo Soup" (1995) and "First Rays of the New Rising Sun" (1997) are officially released attempts to reconstruct the planned album. "First Rays of the New Rising Sun" is usually regarded as closest to Hendrix's vision, but features a track that was probably never part of Hendrix's plans and omits some tracks that were definitely considered. All but one of the tracks that are known to have been recorded for the album have eventually been released in some shape or other on official albums.
Background.
After finishing the double album "Electric Ladyland" in 1968, Hendrix recorded quite obsessively in several studios. The extensive sessions for "Electric Ladyland" had been a reason for Chas Chandler to quit his role of producer, and also soured Hendrix's relation with bass player Noel Redding. Redding eventually quit the band at the end of June 1969. Hendrix had already started recording with old-time friend and bass player Billy Cox. For much of 1969 and 1970 Hendrix was troubled by the constant touring, disappointment in the new band line-ups (first the Gypsy Sun and Rainbows - despite the successful Woodstock performance - and then the Band of Gypsys), demands of manager Michael Jeffrey, girlfriend troubles, the pressure of fame, heavy drug use and personal as well as professional insecurities. Hendrix's extensive use of hired studio time became very expensive and was not always fruitful. In 1969 plans for Hendrix's own nightclub in New York City were converted into a plan for his own recording studio. Electric Lady's Studio A was designed to serve as Hendrix's personal creative space; an inspiring environment where he could develop his music from demos to final mixes, with a supportive team and the best equipment available. After being under construction for 13 months, the first session at Electric Lady's Studio A took place on 15 June 1970 - while Studio B was still unfinished. The studio finally provided creative continuity in a safe haven, but also a place where he could find some rest. There was 24-hour security and Kramer set strict rules to stop having hordes of guests in the studio. Despite the lack of pay for the sessions, Hendrix was mostly joined by the current Experience band members Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell. Mitchell even had to battle Jeffrey for back royalties and tour receipts and it may initially have been unpleasant for him that many tracks that were worked on had Buddy Miles's drum parts, but eventually Mitchell got into the creative spirit of working on the album as much as the ever loyal Cox. Hendrix and his team soon showed much progress in the creation of a new album, so the studio time of August 1970 was almost exclusively used for mixing and overdubbing sessions to finish the recorded songs. On 26 August 1970 four complete songs with final mixes were presented at the Electric Lady opening party. The next morning, Hendrix left for Europe to perform at a couple of festivals and would never see his studio again: he died in London on 18 September 1970.
Tracks considered for inclusion.
A 24 June 1970 memo by Hendrix listed 11 songs "having backing tracks completed", with the last entries "Drifter's Escape", and "Burning Desire", receiving question marks. This memo also noted to get the tape of "Highway Chile". 
An expanded list of 25 titles was handwritten by Hendrix (reportedly on 14 August 1970) under the heading "Songs for L.P. Strate Ahead". The running order is the same for the eleven tracks of the previous list, but many tracks are added in between. The songs with complete backing tracks were marked with crosses. The list also had songs marked with ticks and dashes, but the meaning of those marks is unknown. 
"Message to Love", "Power of Soul", and "Machine Gun" had been recorded in the studio before live versions were released on the "Band of Gypsys" album. Hendrix seemed to think that releasing studio versions of these songs would be regressive and not in tune with his ideas for the new album. Nonetheless, a mix of "Power of Soul" with a new delay effect in the intro and a mix of "Message to Love" were created on 22 August 1970. 
Another list in someone else's handwriting on a tape box detailed the configuration for three sides of a double album with the title "First Rays Of The New Rising Sun". Side D was left blank and two tracks appeared twice, on different sides of the LP.
Unlisted nearly finished new tracks.
Work in August 1970 was reserved for finalizing tracks for the album with overdubs and mixes. There are some tracks that received attention during these mixing sessions that were not included on the lists (possibly because new recordings were made after the lists were compiled): 
Abandoned Electric Lady recordings.
Almost all the recordings at Electric Lady were made with the planned album in mind, but some were incidental jams or compositions that were abandoned:
Album titles.
Hendrix preferred the title "First Rays Of The New Rising Sun" since January 1969. Eddie Kramer believed this would have been the definitive title and it was used for the official reconstructed album release in 1997.
Hendrix christened his 1970 tour "The Cry of Love Tour" in an interview. During the tour "Lover Man", "Hear My Train A Comin"', "Freedom", "Hey Baby (Land of the New Rising Sun)", "Ezy Ryder", "Machine Gun", "The Star-Spangled Banner", "Straight Ahead", "Midnight Lightning", "Dolly Dagger" and "In from the Storm" were performed along with tracks known from his previous albums and singles. The first posthumous studio album, released in 1971, was named after the tour.
When work in his Electric Lady Studios advanced, Hendrix imagined it could become a triple album with the title "People, Hell and Angels". In 2013 this title was used for a compilation of unreleased material.
A memo from August 1970 in his handwriting had 25 titles under the heading "Songs for L.P. Strate Ahead".
Singles.
On 13 April 1970 Reprise Records released "Stepping Stone" and "Izabella" as a 7" single credited to "Hendrix Band of Gypsys". It was reportedly recalled because it could interfere with the sales of the "Band of Gypsys" live album that was delivered to Capitol Records to fulfill a contractual obligation.
A single with "Dolly Dagger" b/w "Night Bird Flying" was mastered on 26 August 1970 and test pressings were cut and taken by Kramer and Hendrix for review . The planned release by Reprise Records was cancelled after Hendrix's death.
Posthumous releases.
Of the ten tracks on "The Cry of Love" (1971) nine songs were on Hendrix's lists and/or were being prepared for the album by Hendrix during the mixing sessions in August 1970. The other track, "My Friend", was recorded in 1968. After Manager Michael Jeffrey had decided to save "Dolly Dagger" and "Room Full of Mirrors" to be released on "Rainbow Bridge" the tracks "My Friend" and "Straight Ahead" were selected instead. Eddie Kramer and Mitch Mitchell produced some finishing touches to "Drifting", "Angel" and "In from the storm". A rough mix of a demo for "Belly Button Window" was included without alterations.
"Voodoo Soup" (1995) was producer Alan Douglas' attempt to compile the unfinished album. 
"First Rays of the New Rising Sun" (1997) is the officially released attempt by Experience Hendrix (his family estate's company) in collaboration with Eddie Kramer to reconstruct the planned double album. It is a compilation of 17 songs that previously appeared on "The Cry of Love", "Rainbow Bridge" and "War Heroes". Like "The Cry of Love" it includes the 1968 recording of "My Friend", while the other 16 tracks were more clearly intended for the album.
Many of the tracks have been released over the years in several different versions, including mixes that Hendrix made during the sessions of 20, 22 and 24 August 1970.

Wear Valley Junction railway station

Wear Valley Junction railway station primarily served as an interchange between the Wear Valley Line and the Weardale Extension Railway (WXR) between 1847 and 1935. It was the closest railway station to the village of High Grange in County Durham, North East England.
History.
The Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway (BA&amp;WR) passed through the future site of the station upon its opening between and in November 1843 and was extended to by the WXR in 1845. However the rural nature of the station's future location meant that it is unlikely that a station was provided initially and it is unknown exactly when passengers began to board and alight from trains at the site: minutes from the Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway Company suggest that it was considering installing a shelter at 'the Valley Junction' for passengers from Witton-le-Wear and other surrounding settlements on 17 October 1845. It is likely that the station opened when the Wear Valley Company's line from the station to on 3 April 1847 and first appeared in the BA&amp;WR timetable in the September of that year as Junction.
The WXR had linked with the Derwent Railway at Waskerley when it first opened but the use of inclines in the area meant that it was not until 1859 (when a deviation was opened to bypass Nanny Mayors Incline) that trains from Wear Valley Junction station were able to run through to . In 1862, the line to Frosterley was extended to by the Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway and was once again extended on 21 October 1895 by the North Eastern Railway between Stanhope and .
The station was situated four hundred yards north of Low Lane. It had an unusual platform layout: the down platform was located south of the junction and could therefore easily serve the branch while to use the up platform, a train for the branch had to cross the junction before reversing into the station due that platform being located north of the junction. Both platforms were linked by a subway. There was also a crescent-shaped turntable with 9 servicing roads, adjacent to the station which was built in 1876 and served nearby mineral trains and sidings. Access between these were controlled by the signal box, which was situated at the junction.
The station was closed to both passengers and goods traffic on 8 July 1935 though passenger and goods train continued to pass through on both lines for many years: the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) closed the former WXR route north of to passengers on 1 May 1939. After the LNER was nationalised to become part of British Railways (BR), the remaining lines began to lose passenger services: the Wearhead branch closed to passengers on 29 June 1953 and the former WXR route was cut back to 11 June 1956 before losing all passenger services on 8 March 1965. The Wearhead branch did retain its goods service until 1961 when it was cut back, first to and then, in 1968, to the Blue Circle Cement Works (later owned by Lafarge) just to the west of . The tracks were lifted on the Crook line by early 1968 but the curtailed Wear Valley Line remained open and, in 1988 BR introduced a summer Sunday extension to the regular to 'Heritage Line' service to Stanhope though no stop was provided at Wear Valley Junction and this service was withdrawn after the summer of 1992 along with the freight on 17 March 1993.
The track was, however, mothballed and a campaign began in 1993 to preserve the line as a heritage railway. Weardale Railways Limited purchased the line in 2004 and reopened it between and Stanhope in July 2004. However the organisation struggled financially and the service was suspended a short time later, not recommencing until August 2006. After major efforts to clear the line of vegetation and repair damaged tracks, passenger services along the section between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland through Wear Valley Junction were reintroduced 23 May 2010 and continued until the end of the 2012 season. Over this period, trains ran non-stop between Wolsingham and Bishop Auckland. Since 2014, the Railway Trust has operated passenger trains on selected weekdays and weekends for mostly tourist traffic using a class 122 "Bubble Car". Initially, this only ran between Wolsingham and Stanhope but, on 27 March 2016, this service was extended to Witton-le-Wear. In April 2018, the Weardale Railway CIC announced that works had commenced to lift a short section of track at Broken Banks (approximately 1/2 mile west of Bishop Auckland) to enable the embankment to be repaired after subsidence had made the line unusable for passenger traffic. Once the works are complete it is intended to reinstate the tracks and extend the Stanhope to Witton-le-Wear passenger service back to Bishop Auckland West station from July 2018 there still do not currently appear to be any plans to reopen Wear Valley Junction.

Anatoly Kitov

Anatoly Ivanovich Kitov (9 August 1920, Samara - 14 october 2005) was a pioneer of cybernetics in the Soviet Union.
Biography.
Early life.
The Kitov's family moved to Tashkent in 1921 as his father, Ivan Stepanovich Kitov, had served as a junior officer in White Army, and wished to avoid the negative consequences of this.[1] Here Anatoly did well at secondary school, gaining only excellent marks when he graduated in 1939. He immediately enrolled for the Tashkent State Technical University but was called up for military service almost immediately.[1] Whilst in the army his exceptional abilities brought him to the attention of Kliment Voroshilov who ordered him to enlist in the High Artillery School in Leningrad. In the end of June 1941 Kitov and his fellow students had to interrupt their learning and were urgently sent to the front. However Kitov was already an officer, a lieutenant. Later Kitov became a commander of the whole anti-aircraft battery, with 8 guns. Intervals between battles Anatoly Kitov filled with studying mathematics and other university subjects. In 1943 he performed his first analytic work, he proposed new method of anti aircraft shooting. That time he was at 22 years old.
Kitov’s study of university subjects helped him gain in August 1945 entry to the F.E. Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy (one of the USSR best military universities) to the faculty of rocket armament, skipping the first academic year so as to start in the second. A.I. Kitov was the chairman of scientific society of the academy’s students. During his studing in the Academy he himself was also working upon development of a rocket weapon of new type. The USSR State Committee on inventions awarded him an “Author’s certificate on the invention” (patent). His project proposal on new rocket-type weapon, among other perspective military inventions, was subsequently reported to I.V. Stalin – the Soviet Army supreme commander. Also at that period A.I. Kitov, still being a student of the academy, was involved in the work of S.P. Korolev’s task force engaged in development of the Soviet missile R-1. In 1950, A. Kitrov graduated from the full course of the Academy with honors and a gold medal.
Diversified scientific and organizational activity of Anatoly I. Kitov has the following 14 milestones in his biography:
Soviet military cybernetics initiatives.
Kitov was the first who implemented for the usage of the first computer (the first soviet serial computer „Strela“) to the Military Ministry of the USSR.Kitov was the first in the USSR to organise and to head scientific work on solving military problems with the use of electronic computers. Those were calculations for General Staff of the USSR armed forces, for the Main Intelligence Directorate, for Main Directorate of the Land Forces, for Directorate of Support, etc. Already in the mid-fifties Kitov developed main principles of computerbased automated military-control and management systems for defence purposes. A big work was performed for implementing them in practical military usage. At the period between the years 1953 and 1963 Kitov issued the fundamental and first in the USSR, series of scientific articles on military informatics’ subjects. They were published by the journals “Military Thought”, “Radioelectronics”, “News of the F.E. Dzerzhisky Artillery Academy”, also by periodical collections of works at the USSR Ministry of Defence and other “special” (classified) sources. In the Computer Center No 1 Ministry of Defense of the USSR Kitov was always the main initiator – „generator of ideas“, who set up the problems and was „the brain“ of their solution, and of the scientific projects in general“. A. Kitov is the founder of Soviet military cybernetics.
First computer department in the USSR.
In 1952, A.I. Kitov founded and headed the first soviet “Department of Computers” at the Artillery Academy. Those time it was called a department of mathematical machines. Also, at 1952 A. Kitov created the USSR first scientific PhD dissertation on programming with the subject “Programming of the outer ballistics problems for the long range missiles”. In 1953, A.I. Kitov published pioneer scientific article, on thirty pages, “Implementation and usage of electronic computers”. That was the first article in the USSR on the subject. At 1954 A.I. Kitov founded the first computer centre in the USSR. It was the Computer Centre No 1 of the USSR Ministry of Defence (CC No 1 MD USSR, secret number 01168) and he was the first header of it. In may, 1954 he was just 33, however enjoyed indisputable authority among his colleagues and subordinates.
Creation of the USSR anti-missile defense system.
Ballistic calculations for strategic rocket forces and for support of the first space flights took special place in the CC №1 work. Description of the architecture of “M-100” became a part of A.I. Kitov’s thesis for doctor’s degree. The dissertation was titled “Implementation of Computers for solving the Problems of Antiaircraft and Antimissile Defence.” He brilliantly defended it in 1963, at the “closed” (for authorised persons only) meeting of the Scientific Council of the Institute of Management Problems, AS USSR. Besides the “M-100”, in his dissertation research Kitov has also analysed principles of designing specialised military computers. He defined specific features of their structure, algorithmic programming language for solving complex of anti-aerial defence problems with the use of computers, and performed computer modelling of dynamical systems connected with air defence systems demands. 
Cybernetics science in the USSR.
From 1948 to 1955, cybernetics was officially called bourgeois pseudoscience in the USSR. In 1951-1952 Kitov read the book Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener in English. He found this book in the library of the secret SKB-245. Kitov not only realized the scientific and social value of cybernetics, but also wrote the first positive article in the USSR, "The main features of cybernetics". It was very daring and could have ended with repressions for Kitov. After all, Joseph Stalin was still alive. But Kitov began the struggle for the recognition of cybernetics in the USSR. 
In 1953-1954 Kitov lectured on cybernetics in well-known Soviet organizations. Kitov invited the venerable scientists Sobolev and Lyapunov to become co-authors of his article "The Main Features of Cybernetics". The article was published in the journal Voprosy Filosofii (1955, No. 4) and for the first time presented the principles of cybernetics to the Soviet audience. The victory for cybernetics was bolstered by the publication two months later of Kitov's article "Technical Cybernetics" in the popular technical monthly "Radio". In 1955-1961, the scientific works of A.I. Kitov played a significant role in the recognition of cybernetics as a science and in its development in the USSR and other socialist countries. 
New computers development.
At the CC №1 A.I. Kitov headed and participated in design and manufacturing of two new computers - “M-100” and “Udar” (blow). Both were successfully put into operation. Computer “M-100” was processing data, which were received form surveillance radiolocation stations. “Udar” was used at preparing ballistic missiles for launching. Author’s certificate for invention given to A.I. Kitov with his three colleagues with priority on the 27th of June 1958 for the principle of the parallel processing of instructions, . Created by Kitov this principle of statements parallel processing by the arithmetic device of computer, which is famous as “conveyor processing” is still in use by modern computers. Kitov proposed to implement this principle at the CC No 1, where it was used for new computer “M-100”, which was developed under Kitov’s guidance. That time it was the quickest lamp computer (first generation) in the USSR and in the world – one hundred thousand computer instructions per second. In "M-100" one of the first immediate access stores on ferrite cores were used. Its two level addressing of Operating Memory Device (cash-memory) was important factor of increasing its performance. There were also some other principle novelties, but they were classified, as the whole project was a secret one. Special department of mathematical support had been established by Kitov for designing computer “M-100”. Besides “M-100”, in CC No 1 for this computer was created a huge amount of software for processing information coming from radars of the Soviet anti-aircraft defence systems.
Writing on programming, computers and their applications.
The books by A.I. Kitov became a part of history of national science and university education as the first most complete sources on computer sciences, programming and automated management systems. Kitov was the author of the first soviet book (1956) and first soviet text-book (1959) on programming, computers and their applications. In common, he published 12 scientific books translated at 9 foreign languages. Kitov's books brought to general readers information and knowledge about the birth of new IT-branch.
Pioneering the automated management systems.
In his first soviet computer book "Digital Electronic Machines" (1956) Kitov published a big part „non-arithmetic usage of computers“. Large chapter of this book is dedicated to usage of computers in economy, automation of production processes and at solving other intellectual problems. In his another book „Electronic Computing Machines“, released in 1958, Kitov describes in details perspectives of complex automation in management, including management of industrial production and solving of economic problems. Anatoly Kitov is the author of the notion “automated management systems - AMS” and also of the philosophy of the Soviet “AMS”. In his “Programming information and logic tasks” (1967) Kitov presents “Associative programming” technology – method for solving information-logical problems with large data-arrays processing. Programming language ALGEM, created under A.I. Kitov's scientific guidance, was described. ALGEM was used in the USSR and in the socialist countries of the East Europe. In his next book "Programming of economical and management tasks" A.I. Kitov generalised experience of his work as the chief designer of the Automated management system (AMS) for the Ministry of Radio-Industry. That system was recognised as the basic model for AMSes for the other nine Ministries of the USSR weapon industry. The book presented basic principles of creation automated management systems for the plants and industry.
Computer networking for the national economy management (project "Red book").
A.I. Kitov was the first one to demonstrate necessity of creation of national automated system for management in the state economy and – simultaneously – in the armed forces, on basis of full-scale usage of electronic computers and mathematical methods. 
Clear understanding of the AMS development importance led Kitov, at the end of 1958, to the conclusion about necessity of automatisation of management of the national economy and also of its armed forces. The main point was, that this automated management system should be based on national network of regional computer centres (project “Red Book”). A.I. Kitov is famous for being the first one in the world who suggested project of an global integrated computer network for automated management of both the USSR national economy and the armed forces, functioning of which would be based on computers and mathematical methods.
He proposed that technological structure of that system would be a global, double purpose, computer network, covering the whole USSR territory. This network should consist of hundreds of computer centres maintained by specially qualified military personnel. In autumn of 1959 A.I. Kitov sent his second letter with his project of global computer network (the project "Red book") to the leader of USSR N.S. Khrushchev.
Information retrieval systems.
Typical example of Kitov’s scientific intuition consisted in his opinion on information retrieval systems. He aimed efforts of his CC №1 scientists at their development. Creation of information retrieval systems became really “pioneer direction” not only for the USSR armed forces but for the whole Soviet IT as well. Anatoly Kitov initiated scientific works at the CC №1 on the mathematical linguistics and machine translation. Kitov proposed to concentrate basic efforts not on direct increasing of performance, but first on development of methods, algorithms and programs which permitted to essentially extend processing, storage and retrieval semantic information. 
Theory and practice of algorithmic programming languages.
A. Kitov is the creator of two algorithmic programming languages - ALGEM and NORMIN. Compared with ALGOL-60, ALGEM was completed with new types of data, which made possible processing of not only numerical but also text-based information and data groups of various types. During a long time ALGEM was a “working horse” for the Soviet programmers, who were working in the field “non-arithmetical” applications of computers, it was also used in numerous
AMS of various levels implemented in industry and administrative management structures, both in the USSR and in the socialist countries.
In the 1970-s while working as the chief-designer of the AMS ‘Healthcare’, A.I. Kitov developed algorithmic programming language NORMIN, which was widely used in the USSR for programming medical problems. That was the first, in the USSR, query language for the information retrieval on formalised natural language. Taking under consideration that medical AMS would be used by the people, who didn’t have special technical education Kitov implemented special interface in his systems, which was convenient and easily understandable on intuition level as much as it was possible at the level of computer development of that time. The interface realised, among others, dialogue mode “human – computer” in normalised natural language NORMIN. 
Computers unification and standardisation.
Already in his letter to N.S. Khrushchev, from 07.01.1959, Kitov insisted that introduction of automated systems in the country should be conducted under supervision of the state administrator of high level – such as the member of the Political-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. The whole work in the field of computation means and automated management systems should be subjected to a single body of the Soviet Union state level –special ministry- which would be granted the monopoly to coordinate, control and implement all developments and achievements of that branch. “"Only such organisation will grant successful progress, rational, without time-delays or senseless chaotic actions"”. In his article ‘Computers – Assistants in each Thing’ from the 12th of July 1960, A.I. Kitov declares, that: “"Taking under consideration exceptional importance of the computer development for the national economy and for the state defence, and also considering the fact that production of these computation means is steadily increasing, the need in centralised control over the work of computation centres of all kinds and categories and in control and coordination of usage of single computers, belonging to various organisations, is getting clear. These measures will enable the most rational usage of computers in interests of the whole country"”.
All that, Kitov wanted to perform on the whole national scale, and wrote about it in many of his articles. Unfortunately, all those ideas and proposals hadn’t been heard and the bureaucratic machine was too slow.
Projects in medical cybernetics.
A.I. Kitov has worked at Health Care and Medicine more than ten years. In the 1970s A.I. Kitov created for medical industry AMS “Health Care” and became a recognised leader in this field both in the USSR and abroad. Kitov managed to solve important scientific problems: information model of the soviet medical industry was created, unified software packages for forming and logical control of information arrays were worked out. In fact, during his “Medical period” A.I. Kitov started scientific research practically from the zero point and moved medical informatics of the USSR several tens of years ahead. Within the healthcare field he established scientific school, brought up number of talented followers, number of dissertation works were completed under his guidance. He also published several conceptual articles and three monographs: “Automation of Information processing and Management in the Healthcare
Field“ (1976). “Introduction into Medical Cybernetics“ (1977) and “Medical Cybernetics“(1983). A.I. Kitov made great contribution to creation of „local“ medical AMSes, which functioned within specific enterprises – at hospitals, clinics, drugstores. The first AMS of that type operated at the clinical hospital No 6 subjected to the Third Directorate of the USSR Ministry of Health. Later this AMS supported a great deal of work at curing and rehabilitation of victims of Chernobyl power station catastrophe of 1986. Even there he managed to be a pioneer – the founder of soviet medical cybernetics.
During 12 years A.I. Kitov was the national representative of the USSR at influential organisations in the field of medical informatics at the United Nations and the UNESCO: • International Federation of medical informatics: (MedINFO). • International Medical Informatics Association: Officer of IMIA. • Technical Committee No4 of International Federation for Information Processing (TC-4 IFIP).
He participated in organization of three international congresses Med-INFO: Ist World Congress of MedINFO – 1974 (Stokholm), IInd World Congress of MedINFO – 1977 (Toronto), IIIrd World Congress of MedINFO – 1980 (Tokyo). A.I. Kitov at these congresses was the member of Organizing Committee and Programm Committee. About a thousand scientists from developed countries gathered at MedINFO-1977. A.I. Kitov was a chairman of the section on biomedical researches (Session T2 – «BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH GENERAL»).
Pedagogical activity.
Pedagogical activity took important place in A.I. Kitov’s work. As it is clearly visible from his biography, he had born interest for acquiring knowledge and their dissemination; passing them to those who surrounded him. For great many of IT specialists A.I. Kitov is famous, first of all, as the author of the first soviet books and textbooks on computing and programming. Else at the 1951–1952, at the Artillery Academy name F.E. Dzerzhinsky A.I. Kitov conducted one of the three, first in the USSR, courses of lectures on computers and programming. More than 40 post graduates, both Soviet and foreign, prepared and defended dissertations under Kitov’s scientific supervision. In 1980, when A.I. Kitov already had rich experience of scientific work and of teaching, he received position at the Russian G.V. Plekhanov University of Economics, where he worked during seventeen years. He headed the chair of „Computer Engineering and Programming“.

Pir Mardakan Khanqah

Pir Mardakan Khanqah () is historic architectural monument located in the village of Goylar, 16 km south-west of Shamakhi district of the Azerbaijan Republic. The complex includes a tomb, a dynasty building and small auxiliary buildings. It was built in XIII-XIV centuries. According to some sources, this is the tomb of Seyid Mardakani, one of the famous scholars of his time.
History.
Some of the remaining inscriptions on the grave stone and in the wall were read by M. Nematova. On these inscriptions it is shown that the monument was built in 1188 – 1203 (583 – 600 of Hijri calendar. According to the style characteristics, history of the monument is dated back to the early XIII century.
There is an ancient cemetery, caravanserai complex around the khanqah. An inscription on the facade of the monument, written in the Arabic written in thuluth script with kufic element, says: "In the Name of Allah, the merciful and the gracious. This is the grave of the Sheikh, the Imam, the greatest scientist, the believer, Tair Taj Al-Huda Mardakani Ibn Ali. May Allah have mercy upon them..." 
It is possible to clarify history of the monument based on the second inscription on the tomb. A small part, two lines of the inscription fixed on the left wall, on the left side of entering from the door, remains: "The greatest padishah, khagan... Farrukhzad ibn Fazilalmuwahhid Manuchihr..." The author explains that this is ruler is Shirvanshah Farrukhzad I, the son of Shirvanshah Manuchihr III. He also lived in the XIII century.
The scientist notes that there is a place named Madak in Iranian Azerbaijan. The "-ani" suffix indicates that the owner of the grave is from there. The word "Madakani" transformed into "Mardakan", over the history.
Architectural features.
The tomb, which is a part of the complex has reached today's era with almost its original view. These mausoleums, which have other examples in the architecture of Azerbaijan, typically consist of a combination of two-domed and tower-shaped tombs. As examples of this type of mausoleum in architecture of Azerbaijan, the tomb in Alinjachay Khanqah in Nakhchivan and other tombs can be. The plan of the Pir Mardakan mausoleum repeats the very coincidental version of the tombs with domes. By volume, these types of tombs consist of combination of two combinations. The bottom part is with dome and tower, and the upper part is covered with dome. The upper part looks independent from outside in terms of its composition, not as a continuation of the bottom part since usually in such tombs there is no gradual transition between cube-shaped and the upper tower parts.
As mausoleums with dome were temple-type buildings, people used to come and pay visit to buried and hold religious ceremonies in such places. Therefore, these type of mausoleums were also used as a mosque. Internal tomb part of the mausoleum square shaped according to structure of it and through squinches in the corners it turns into an octagon. Eight-edged prism on the octagon is covered with pyramidal tent. When remotely looking at the tomb, it resembles an ordinary octagonal tomb because relief of the earth covers the lower-cubed portion. The size of outer walls of it is 4.6x5 m, and the internal walls are 2.6x2.6 m. The height of the square part is 3 m, the height of the pyramid is 4.7 m.
From the east side of the tomb khanqah building with three rooms is fixed. Large room is 4.4x7.3 m in size and is for worship. Only one of the rooms reached today's era. The other two rooms are completely destroyed.
This monument belongs to a group of tombs of Azerbaijan with towers and domes according to many features of it. Monuments that share similarities with Pir Mardakan Khanqah according to the structural and architectural features, monuments similar to Pir Mardakan Khanate are spread in other Turkic countries. For example, in Turkmenistan there are several architectural monuments repeating the architectural features of this tomb. Fakhraddin Razi and Sheikh Sharif mausoleums in Kunya-Urgench can be examples.

Garrison Ground 2

Garrison Ground 2 was a cricket ground in Gillingham, Kent. The ground, which has also been known as the Royal Engineers Sports Ground and simply the Garrison Ground, was used by Kent County Cricket Club for first-class and List A cricket between 1937 and 1972 and was the home ground of the Royal Engineers Cricket Club until 1961.
The ground was located on Marlborough Road on the edge of the area known as the Chatham Lines, an area of open space historically containing a number of military fortifications. The site, which is now used as a recreation ground, is around west of Gillingham High Street.
Cricket history.
The ground was first used in 1864 by the Royal Engineers. It was used regularly by the club until 1961 when they moved to Garrison 1 Cricket Ground on the southern edge of the Chatham Lines.
The ground played host to 30 first-class, 28 of which featured Kent as the home side, and three List A matches. The Combined Services played two home matches on the ground, one against Kent and one against the touring New Zealanders in 1949. Kent's Second XI used the ground occasionally, most recently in 1994, and it was the venue for a match between Kent and the touring West Indians in August 1984, a 40 over benefit match for Bob Woolmer.
By the end of the 1967 season the quality of the pitch was causing "grave concern" to the MCC's Advisory County Cricket committee after 26 wickets fell in one days play in 1967 during which "the ball turned, stopped and lifted, sometimes prodigiously". The following year 22 wickets fell in a day on a pitch which was described as "a nightmare for batsmen". Following the match the Pitches Committee determined that the ground should not be used for first-class cricket in 1969 and the 1968 match was the final first-class fixture on the ground, although three List A matches were played on the ground, two in 1971 and one in 1972.
Kent have also used other pitches on the Chatham Lines, including Garrison 1 Cricket Ground and New Brompton Cricket Ground and cricket has been played on other pitches in the area. The ground was used by Old Anchorians Cricket Club until 1999.
Records on the ground.
A total of 30 first-class cricket matches were played on the ground, all but two with Kent as the home side.
The ground's three List A fixtures all featured Kent as the home side. The highest total made was 208 runs by Kent against Gloucestershire in 1971, with David Nicholls recording the ground's highest List A individual score in the same match with 64 runs. Derek Underwood recorded the best bowling figures on the ground in List A matches in the same game, taking four wickets for 25 runs from eight overs. All three matches on the ground were 40 over matches in the John Player League.
Modern use.
The ground is no longer in use as a cricket ground. This site is used as a recreation ground with football pitches laid out and was used by the Royal Engineers for hockey, football and rugby union in the past. The nearby Garrison Stadium has been used for a number of sports and is the current home of Medway Dragons who use it for rugby league.

Climate and energy

In the 21st century, the earth's climate and its energy policy interact and their relationship is studied and governed by a variety of national and international institutions.
The correlation between climate and energy rests on known causal relationships between human population growth, rising energy consumption and land use and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
The concern for climate change control and mitigation has consequently spurred policy makers and scientists to treat energy use and global climate as an inextricable nexus with effects also going in reverse direction and create various initiatives, institutions and think tanks for a high-level treatment of the relationships:

Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry

The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, also known as the Banking Royal Commission and the Hayne Royal Commission, was a royal commission established on 14 December 2017 by the Australian government pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation, and financial services industry. The establishment of the commission followed revelations in the media of a culture of greed within several Australian financial institutions. A subsequent parliamentary inquiry recommended a royal commission, noting the lack of regulatory intervention by the relevant government authorities, and later revelations that financial institutions were involved in money laundering for drug syndicates, turned a blind eye to terrorism financing, and ignored statutory reporting responsibilities and impropriety in foreign exchange trading.
The Honourable Kenneth Madison Hayne , the former Justice of the High Court of Australia, served as the sole commissioner and submitted an interim report to the Governor-General of Australia on 28 September 2018, which was tabled in parliament by the Government on the same day. The Royal Commission conducted seven rounds of public hearings over 68 days, called more than 130 witnesses and reviewed over 10,000 public submissions. Commissioner Hayne submitted a final report to the Governor-General on 1 February 2019 with 76 separate recommendations. The final report and the government's response to the report were made public on 4 February 2019.
Background.
Michelle Grattan characterised the then-incoming Abbott Liberal-National government as being "determined to weaken protections" that Labor had introduced, although she noted these attempts were defeated by the Senate crossbench.
In light of an account fraud scandal at US-bank Wells Fargo, on 5 May 2014 ABC TV "Four Corners", in conjunction with Fairfax journalists, broadcast an exposé of a sales-driven culture within the Commonwealth Bank's (CBA) financial planning division, that was described as profit at all cost. Chaired by Labor Senator Mark Bishop, a subsequent Senate committee inquiry recommended a royal commission into the fraud scandal that left thousands of CBA customers millions of dollars out of pocket. The committee reported on the performance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Several days later, CBA chief executive Ian Narev apologised unreservedly to customers who lost money in the bank's financial planning scandal. Treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, whose mother was impacted by the scandal, stated that the bank did not act quickly enough to address the problem. The CBA was subsequently embroiled in other matters including money laundering for drug syndicates, turning a blind eye to terrorism financing, ignoring statutory reporting responsibilities for more than three years on more than 750,000 accounts, and impropriety in foreign exchange trading.
The National Australia Bank (NAB) was implicated during 2015 in a series of scandals concerning financial planners where it was revealed that the NAB quietly paid millions of dollars in compensation to hundreds of clients for what it considered was inappropriate financial planning advice by its staff between 2009 and 2015. A whistleblower claimed that there was a volatile, toxic and Machiavellian culture within NAB. ASIC banned NAB staff who were previously licensed to provide financial advice. Subsequently, it was revealed that NAB were also implicated in impropriety in foreign exchange trading.
Westpac was implicated in allegations that it rigged one of Australia's key interest rates, the bank bill swap rate and was sued under responsible lending laws for using an automated process to decide whether peoples' home loan applications met lending criteria. Further, a Westpac banker was imprisoned for fraudulently lending millions of dollars to elderly pensioners. Following ASIC investigations, Westpac was instructed to make a donation of $3 million to Financial Literacy Australia after ASIC found that the bank's employees disclosed confidential details of their clients' orders to other foreign exchange traders. Westpac refunded $65 million to 220,000 customers after it failed to pass on benefits they should have received under package deals, including home loans, credit cards and transaction accounts, offered by the bank.
The ANZ Bank (ANZ) was also implicated in the bank bill swap rate scandal and settled with ASIC prior to the commencement of legal proceedings.
Macquarie Bank was implicated in the foreign exchange trading scandal and was instructed to donate $2 million to charity and to open up its foreign exchange arm to scrutiny after ASIC uncovered a series of breaches by its traders.
Appearing before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, chief executives of the ANZ, CBA, NAB, and Westpac advised that, despite consumer complaints, very few senior bank staff were dismissed due to misconduct; despite supervising more junior staff who had been dismissed.
In a 2016 speech before the National Press Club, opposition leader Bill Shorten outlined his plans for a royal commission into the banking sector, should Labor win government at the 2016 federal election. Meanwhile, Liberals Warren Entsch also supported calls for a royal commission; as well as CBA whistleblower, Jeff Morris, who, for eight years, since 2008, documented the industry's "systemic bad behaviour".
Despite an attempt launched in April 2016 to protect consumer interests, increase transparency and accountability, and build trust and confidence in banks, amidst growing community concerns, in January 2017 twenty-five members of the Australian Banking Association launched "Better Banking", an initiative aimed to provide improve products, service and culture, and to provide consumers with helpful information and resources. In April 2016 Steve Sedgwick , a former senior Australian public servant, was commissioned to conduct a review into bankers' pay and commissions; and recommended the termination of bonus payments to retail bank employees that are linked to sales performance. In March 2017 ASIC handed down a report on financial advice compliance in the sector; and in September 2017 the Turnbull government introduced legislation to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, an external dispute resolution body aimed to simplify how customers resolve complaints with bank and other financial services organisations.
Over the preceding years, there had been widespread criticism of ASIC's activities as a regulatory body, including its supervision of banks.
In late 2017, as a backlash against the legalisation of same sex marriage, the Nationals threatened to introduce a private member's bill calling for a commission of inquiry into the banking system. It was reported that the bill would be co-sponsored by the Nationals, Labor, the Greens and Senate crossbench parties. Nationals Senator Barry O'Sullivan, and LNP MPs George Christensen and Llew O'Brien, together with the Greens, Labor, and Senate crossbench parties, had enough numbers to force the Turnbull government's opposition to a royal commission.
In the 2017 federal budget, the Turnbull government proposed the introduction of a bank tax (or levy) that applied to banks with liabilities of at least $100 billion. The levy came into effect on 1 July 2017.
With political pressure mounting, on 30 November 2017 Turnbull and his Treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced plans for a royal commission. The royal commission was established on 14 December 2017.
Terms of reference.
On 14 December 2017, the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove issued Commonwealth letters patent appointing the commissioner and the commission's terms of reference. The commissioner was directed "to inquire into and report on misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry." It was due to table its final report on 1 February 2019, which had been noted to be not long before the 2019 Australian federal election.
Response.
The creation of the royal commission was supported by the Opposition leader, Bill Shorten; however, opposition treasury spokesperson, Chris Bowen, stated that Labor disagreed with the terms of reference and wanted the Government to consult with consumer groups and those impacted by financial scandals. Meanwhile, the Greens sought to widen the commission's terms of reference. The Australian Banking Association, and some of its members, who initially opposed calls for a royal commission, supported the terms of reference; however the Association's CEO, Anna Bligh warned that the commission could push up interest rates.
As revelations of misconduct came to light during the hearings, political pressure was exerted on the Turnbull government, due to beliefs that it had delayed the establishment of the Royal Commission; and Mathias Cormann, the Finance Minister, indicated that if Commissioner Hayne sought more time to extend the life of the Royal Commission, the government would respond positively.
Commissioner and executive.
On 1 December 2017 Turnbull announced the appointment of Kenneth Hayne as the sole commissioner for the royal commission.
Commissioner Hayne subsequently announced that he would be assisted by legal counsel including Rowena Orr QC, Michael Hodge, Albert Dinelli, Eloise Dias, and Mark Costello.
Powers.
The powers of Royal Commissions in Australia are set out in the enabling legislation, the Royal Commissions Act 1902.
Royal Commissions, appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act or otherwise, have powers to issue a summons to a person to appear before the Commission at a hearing to give evidence or to produce documents specified in the summons; require witnesses to take an oath or give an affirmation; and require a person to deliver documents to the Commission at a specified place and time. A person served with a summons or a notice to produce documents must comply with that requirement, or face prosecution for an offence. The penalty for conviction upon such an offence is two years imprisonment. A Royal Commission may authorise the Australian Federal Police to execute search warrants.
Submissions.
The Commission invited individuals or entities to make public submissions using an online form, with provision for those who require further assistance via email or telephone. The purpose of the submissions was to identify the nature of alleged misconduct, the factors that led to the misconduct occurring, and the steps taken to resolve the complaint and the outcomes of the complaint. The role of the Commission was not to resolve individual complaints, yet to come to an understanding of the systematic failures that may have led to the complaint occurring.
The Royal Commission conducted seven rounds of public hearings over 68 days, called more than 130 witnesses and reviewed over 10,000 public submissions of which the leading matters related to personal finance, superannuation, and small business finance.
The commissioner identified a number of themes, as follows:
Public hearings.
Initial proceedings commenced on 12 February 2018. Key comments made by the Commissioner during this hearing and elsewhere include:
Consumer lending practices.
The first round of public hearings commenced on 13 March, and these were focused on consumer lending practices within the context of credit products such as home loans, car loans and credit cards. Over fourteen days, the Royal Commission heard from executives from ANZ Bank, APRA, ASIC, Aussie Home Loans, Citigroup, Commonwealth Bank, the Finance Sector Union, ING Bank, NAB, Smartline HomeLoans and Westpac. Before the Royal Commission:
The Royal Commission heard that ANZ had failed to accurately verify the living expenses of home loan customers referred to the bank by mortgage brokers, believing that this was the responsibility of the brokers, in spite of a conflict of interest in doing so; and that, due to processing issues, it had charged nearly 500,000 home loan customers the incorrect interest rate for more than ten years, leading the bank to overcharge customers by approximately $90 million.
Commissioner Hayne questioned whether the CBA was "economical with the truth" in failing to tell customers the value of commissions it pays to mortgage brokers in return for selling its products. The Royal Commission also heard that due to a system of trailing commissions paid to mortgage brokers, the CBA rewarded brokers for encouraging customers to enter into larger homes loans and for longer terms than needed. The Royal Commission heard that the CBA-owned Aussie Home Loans retained commissions where broker agreements were terminated following detection of alleged fraudulent activity; and that it failed to refer such brokers to the industry association for disciplinary action.
However, when queried on the matter by Counsel Assisting that "...there was fraudulent conduct engaged in by NAB bankers and by introducers... We see no reference here to any fraudulent conduct. In fact the language is very qualified in the description of the conduct here... the conduct was in breach of the group's policies and processes including provision of potentially unsuitable loans, reliance on potentially false documentation, use of correct income figures, potentially dishonest application of customers' signatures, and a potential misstatement of some loans in loan documentation. Now, what I want to put to you is that NAB knows and you know that there were unsuitable loans, there was false documentation, there was dishonest application of customers' signatures on consent forms and there was the misstatement of some loans in loan documentation. All of those things occurred, did they not?" NAB's Mark Waldron agreed that conduct was fraudulent and beyond misconduct; "Yes, we can now say that they have occurred." It was reported that NAB employees in greater western Sydney were accepting bribes in order to facilitate loans they knew were based on false documentation in order to reach lending targets and to collect personal bonuses; and up to 15 per cent of all home loans approved did not meet NAB's standard criteria for valuation, serviceability and document verification.
The Commission heard that, similar to ANZ, Westpac believed that it was not its responsibility to verify loan applicants' personal expenses, with this responsibility resting with brokers, especially for car loans originated by motor vehicle dealers acting as brokers; and that financial kickbacks to car dealers reflected a conflict of interest.
Financial planning and wealth management.
In mid-April 2018, the second round of hearings, focused on the financial planning and wealth management industry commenced. During this round, on 20 April 2018 Craig Meller resigned as CEO of AMP Limited after it was revealed in a public hearing before the Royal Commission that AMP charged clients for financial advice which was not provided, and misled ASIC on numerous occasions.
In August 2018 it was revealed that NAB subsidiary, MLC Limited, had charged some of its customers "adviser contribution fees" and "employer service fees" on its superannuation products. By its own admission, NAB executives told the Royal Commission that the customers may have not received any service, in spite of being charge a fee. NAB tried to disguise these fees as commissions. The following month ASIC commenced civil proceedings in the Federal Court alleging that NAB-owned superannuation entities had deducted $100 million in fees from more than 300,000 customers where services were not provided. Appearing before the Royal Commission in November 2018, NAB Chief Executive Officer Andrew Thorburn defended the fees-for-no-service issue as a “process issue” rather than dishonesty. Days earlier, NAB Chairman and former Secretary of The Treasury Ken Henry defensively appeared before the Royal Commission, with some tense exchanges between Henry and Orr.
Small and medium enterprises.
The third round of hearings commenced in mid-May 2018 and was focused on small and medium enterprises.
Implications: SMEs are now looking towards other sources of finance; shadow lenders, private loans, bonds etc. The commission has also brought about changes in the provision of lending under the new industry code and granted ASIC new enforceable code of provisions.
Financial services and Indigenous communities.
In July, proceedings moved to Darwin to examine financial services, particularly funeral insurance, and how they impacted on Indigenous communities. The Royal Commission did not consider consumer leases, payday loans or in-store credit arrangements' impacts on Indigenous communities because they are not within the terms of reference.
The discrepancy between average life expectancy of an Indigenous individuals and non-indigenous, highlights a fault in the superannuation system, where essentially individuals are restricted access to their super until 60 years. For many this is way too late and individuals need access to these funds to support themselves, their family and their community. To put this in perspective, the average life expectancy of an Indigenous male in the NT is 63.6 years.
Reports.
On 28 September 2018 Commissioner Hayne submitted an interim report on progress of the Commission to the Governor-General. The interim report, together with a volume each of case studies and appendices was tabled in Parliament on the same day. In its interim report, the Commissioner noted that some (mis)conduct by financial services entities was known to regulators and that the Commission had also unearthed other conduct that brought public condemnation. The interim report focused on two key issues; why did it happen, and what can be done to avoid it happening again?
In responding to the issue of 'why', the Commissioner determined that: 
In responding to the issue of 'what now', the Commissioner opined that:
The Commissioner detailed that there would be a further round of public hearings to consider these and other questions, for consideration in the Commissioner's Final Report. The interim report contained substantial findings against banks, insurance companies, and financial planners.
Commissioner Hayne handed his final report to the Governor-General on 1 February 2019. The final report comprised a 496-page document together with seven themes and 76 separate recommendations, supported by a volume each of cases studies and appendices. On 4 February 2019 the government issued its response to the Commissioner's recommendations.
Feedback on the final report.
Commissioner Hayne did not make or name any specific individual who should face criminal charges. Instead, his report made 24 recommendations relating to institutions and individuals about dishonest misconduct and charged the regulators with the responsibility for taking action. Some media feedback was that this approach was part of the problem, citing that ASIC, in particular, had a long history of not proactively enforcing its powers. Some of Hayne's most scathing comments were reserved for NAB's chair, Ken Henry, and CEO, Andrew Thorburn:
Despite initially defending their positions, by 7 February both Henry and Thorburn had announced their resignations.
Financial markets initially responded positively to the final report, having earlier factored in that banks and other financial institutions would be severely penalised. Markets viewed the response from the government as measured and a view that some recommendations would help the financial services sector.

Giorgio Coda

Giorgio Giuseppe Antonio Maria Coda (born 21 January 1924) is an Italian psychiatrist and professor. He was vicedirector of the mental hospital of Turin (, in Collegno) and director of "villa Azzurra" (institute for children), in Grugliasco (Turin) After the trial, that lasted from 1970 to 1974, he was sentenced for mistreatment to five years in prison, to the payment of court costs and to the interdiction from the medical profession for five years. He has been nicknamed "the electrician" () for his misuse of the electroshock therapy.
The medical treatment consisted in the application of long-lasting electric current to the genitals and to the head. The treatment did not make the patient lose consciousness and caused strong pain. According to Giorgio Coda, this treatment should have cured the patient. The treatment was called alternatively "electro-massage" () or electroshock depending on whether it was applied to the genitals or to the head. In some cases, the two terms have been used without distinction to denote the generic treatment. The treatment was practiced systematically without anesthesia and, sometimes, without cream and rubber protection device inside the mouth, blowing up the patient's teeth during the treatments. During the trial, Giorgio Coda admitted he had practiced about 5000 "electro-massages" in his career.
The above treatment was also administered to alcoholics, drug addicts, homosexuals and masturbators, and it generated a so strong fear of the treatment, that most patients, at least temporarily, desisted from their acts and behaviors. The trial and the sentence, collected and analyzed in Alberto Papuzzi's book "Portami su quello che canta" have shown the coercive and punitive purpose of "electro-massages", which were not instruments of cure but atrocious instruments of torture and punishment, used on children too (in "villa Azzurra").
Some suspicious deaths during the treatments and some suicides occurred in the institutes gave rise to the suspicion that they may have been provoked (at least partly) by the fear of the suffering during the treatments.
The case, at that time, has been interpreted politically by some journalists and part of the public opinion, according to the stereotypes of the so-called Years of Lead (1970s). According to this interpretation, the "bourgeois" doctor had tortured the weakest members of the "proletariat".
Biography.
Most of the details about Giorgio Coda's life and academic career is given by Alberto Papuzzi's book "Portami su quello che canta".
Born in Turin on January 21, 1924 in a wealthy family, Giorgio Coda is the only child of Carlo Coda, a small industrialist from Turin who "regulated the family life as if it were a factory" and Alda Vacchieri. "At school, Giorgio Coda excelled in conduct. He was not brilliant, but very diligent. A few schoolmates remember him as a grind."
In 1943, Giorgio Coda enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Turin and graduated on July 15, 1948 with a thesis about criminal anthropology. On April 16, 1955, Giorgio Coda marries Giovanna Roviera. After becoming head physician of the department, on April 3, 1963 he became a professor of psychiatry.
The trial starts right after the Italian court specialized in minors - "Tribunale per i minorenni" - receives a report from children's social worker Maria Repaci. The report is about the facts of villa Azzurra. On September, 7, Giogio Coda is indicted for the crime "misuse of the correction systems" and the amnesty is granted, as provided by Italian law ("DPR n. 238 del 22 maggio 1970").
On December 14, 1970, an Italian judge receives another report from an Italian association - "Associazione per la lotta contro le malattie mentali" - which turned out to be crucial in order to start the investigation and the trial. On July 11, 1974 Giorgio Coda is found guilty - "responsible for the crime only for the facts of the mental hospital in Collegno". Subsequently, Giorgio Coda's defender appeals against the sentence.
On December 2, 1977, at around 6:30 pm, four men, all of them members of the Italian Marxist–Leninist terrorist group Prima Linea penetrated into Giorgio Coda's office and shot him in the leg.
At the Court of appeal of Turin, Coda's defense cleverly exploited what the judge Rodolfo Venditti called a "torpedo", a sort of legal trick, based on the fact that Giorgio Coda, as an expert, had been an "honorary judge" () of the Juvenile Court () in Turin and therefore, since he had been a sort of "judge", he could not be tried in the same court where he had worked as a judge (as stated by Italian law). This detail was perhaps kept hidden by Coda's defense over the whole inferior court trial, and the discovery of this led to the annulment of the judgment and to the slowdown of the whole trial. Subsequently, the sentence was sent to the so-called Court of cassation (the last step of Italy's three grades of judgement), but the crimes were time-barred and Coda never served any penalty because of crime prescription. Giorgio Coda, according to newspapers, is still alive.
Effects.
The case (as well as the book that collected and analyzed the stories, "Portami su quello che canta", published in 1977) shocked the public opinion in Italy and sparked a debate. This led to a new law regulating Italian mental hospitals - the so-called Basaglia Law (in 1978, named after its promoter Franco Basaglia) - that abolished the main articles of the previous law - "legge n. 36 del 14 febbraio 1904". The Basaglia Law also introduced and regulated the T.S.O. (that stands for "Trattamento sanitario obbligatorio" - Obligatory Sanitary Treatment), narrowing its scope and defining a multi-level procedure for its enforcement.
In particular, the new law required the intermediation of the mayor and the judge for the application of a T.S.O, the possibility for anyone (including the patient) to ask the T.S.O. to be revoked or modified, the possibility for anyone (including the patient) to appeal against the order validated by the judge, and the possibility for the patient to communicate with anyone during the T.S.O. The patient also has the right to change mental hospital, if possible. The previous law had given too much power to the director of the mental hospital and it did not provide that the patient could communicate with anybody during the treatment.
Even though Basaglia Law did not explicitly provide that mental hospitals should be closed, it, in fact, closed most of Italy's mental hospitals, closure that was completed in 1998. Basaglia Law made Italy one of the first countries to abolish mental hospitals.

Elmer Crumbley

Elmer Crumbley (1 August 1908 – 1993) was an American trombonist.
Biography.
Crumbley made a lifetime out of music mainly in the traditional swing tradition, as with the Cab Calloway and Earl Hines bands of the 1960s and '70s. He joined the Dandie Dixie Minstrels in 1926 with bandleader Lloyd Hunter. He played with the George E. Lee Band, western swing pioneer Tommy Douglas, and Bill Owens. But he continued to work with Hunter as well as players such as Jabbo Smith and Erskine Tate. Crumbley founded his own ensemble in Omaha in 1934, and joined up with the Jimmie Lunceford Band the same year. He also played with Eddie Wilcox, Lucky Millinder, and Erskine Hawkins. He toured Europe in the late 1950s with Sammy Price, a period when he also became part of the scene at the Apollo in Harlem with a lively combo led by Reuben Phillips.

Nicolette Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry

Nicolette Elaine Katherine Powell, formerly The Most Hon. Nicolette Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry ("née" Nicolette Harrison; 1941 – 13 August 1993), was the first wife of The 9th Marquess of Londonderry, and later the wife of musician Georgie Fame.
Early life.
Nicolette, often called "Nico" for short, was the daughter of stockbroker Michael Harrison and his wife, the former Maria Madeleine Benita von Koskull, a Latvian baroness. She was a "debutante", one of the last to be presented to Queen Elizabeth II before the practice was abolished.
Marriage and family.
She married the Marquess on 16 May 1958, when she was seventeen. They made their home at Wynyard Hall and had two children:
The paternity of her elder son, Tristan Alexander (born 1969), who briefly held the courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh, was contested when he was about 18 months old, and he was confirmed to be the son of Georgie Fame (real name Clive Powell), with whom the young Marchioness had been having an extramarital relationship. One of the Marchioness's daughters, Lady Cosima, later claimed that her true father might be musician and writer Robin Douglas-Home.
The 1971 divorce of Lord and Lady Londonderry was the subject of considerable publicity. The following year, the Marchioness married Georgie Fame at Marylebone Register Office, and her married name became Nicolette Powell. Lord Londonderry subsequently married ballerina Doreen Wells. 
As Nicolette Powell, the former Marchioness gave birth to a second son, James Michael, in 1973.
Later life.
In 1993, she died after falling from Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Her death was registered as suicide. She had left a note stating that she saw "no purpose in life" now that her children had grown up and left home.
Several portrait photographs of her are held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

Siege of Kromy

The siege of Kromy was the last major clash of government troops of Boris Godunov with the rebel army of False Dmitry I.
Prelude.
After Battle of Dobrynichy, most noblemen and mercenaries with whom False Dmitry I began his campaign left him, but under his banner, peasants and Cossacks flocked massively, dissatisfied with the rule of Godunov and who supposedly believed False Dmitry to be "the lawful sovereign".
The siege.
A small garrison of Kromy was reinforced by five hundred Cossacks led by the ataman Andrei Korela, who retreated here after the battle of Dobrynichi. The walls were destroyed by artillery fire, but the defenders of Kromy effectively defended themselves in the system of trenches, which they dug in the city. Nevertheless, the losses on both sides were high and the ataman Korela demanded reinforcements from False Dmitry I in Putivl, threatening to surrender the city. False Dmitriy reacted by sending a large detachment to Kromy. Thanks to the fact that the tsarist troops accepted these warriors for their own, they entered the fortress with a large train. The fighting lasted a few more weeks before the ceasefire.
In the huge camp of Mstislavsky began an epidemic of dysentery. Godunov's order not to leave the army caused indignation among the nobles, and many in spite of the ban went home.
Aftermath.
On April 13, 1605, Boris Godunov died and his son, Fedor, became Tsar. Many of the boyars began to look for ways to get rid of the elected Zemstvo dynasty. On May 7, most of the government army, following the agitation of the hero of the Novgorod-Seversk siege, Peter Basmanov (who took part in the conspiracy against the Godunovs), took the side of False Dmitry. Tsar Fedor II Godunov was killed by the Pretender's agents on June 10, 1605 and False Dmitry I entered Moscow as the new Tsar. His rule would last till May 17, 1606, when he would be killed and replaced by Vasili IV Shuiski.

Prince Valiant (Fantagraphics)

Prince Valiant is a series of hardcover books, published by Fantagraphics Books, that collects the "Prince Valiant" comic strip, written and drawn by Hal Foster. The release of the series began in August 2009.
Background.
"Prince Valiant", written and drawn by Hal Foster, was a Sunday newspaper comic strip published weekly in full color from February 13, 1937, to the early 1970s when the strip saw a change of writer and artist. The strip itself has continued to the present day and has since its start belonged to the comic syndicate King Features.
Format.
The series are collected in hardcover volumes with matte paper stock and sewn binding. A single volume includes two years of Sunday strip pages as well as some supplementary content, such as interviews and introductions. In total this amounts to about 120 pages per book.
Reproduction.
All comic strip content in this series is reproduced from Foster's original engraver's proofs, in full original; and the original coloring has been restored in a reproduction for the first time. Previous collections of "Prince Valiant" have never had such good material as a base for reproduction. These proofs were ones preserved by Foster himself and, after his passing, donated to Syracuse University, which provided Fantagraphics with scans of these proofs for this collection. Recent advancements in digital color technology now permit a better and more faithful reproduction compared to previous "Prince Valiant" collections, e.g. the Nostalgia Press' collection from the 1960s and Fantagraphics Books previous trade paperback collection published between 1984 and 2004. These earlier collections did recolor the comic strip but not accordingly to the appearance it had in newspapers when first published. The line work of these older collections also appear subpar to that in this latest Fantagraphics' "Prince Valiant" collection.
Sizing.
While the volumes of this book collection measure , the original newspaper publication of the comic strip were usually printed on a full broadsheet page, where it appeared measuring . The largest reproduction of "Prince Valiant", yet, is in the Artist's Edition book: "Fantagraphics Studio Edition: Hal Foster's Prince Valiant", , also published by Fantagraphics Books, measuring . Hal Foster originally drew a whole "Prince Valiant" Sunday page on paper stock measuring , which makes this collection series' area size equal to about 16 percent of the original art size.
Extras.
The supplementary material features interviews with comic historians and with Hal Foster himself, original artwork, essays, biographical sketches by Hal Foster, as well as galleries of dropped panels (those deemed too risqué or violent). In the fourth volume, spanning the years 1943 to 1944, the comic strip tale "The Medieval Castle", a separate strip Foster drew, is included. This strip was a tale he drew when he split up the page he was allowed for the "Prince Valiant" strip during the Second World War, due to a paper shortage and newspaper space being at a premium, splitting his full one-page spread between three-quarters of a page for "Prince Valiant" and one-quarter for "The Medieval Castle", in order to make it easy for editors to remove the non-"Prince Valiant" strip to free-up space for something of greater importance in wartime. The plot of "The Medieval Castle" revolves around the childhood and life of two young princes in a medieval castle.
Volumes and box sets.
The volumes are sold separately as well as in box sets. The suggested retail price of a volume was $29.99, at the beginning of the publication; but the price was later raised to $34.99 per volume. The suggested retail price for a box set is $99.99.

Biography.
Siedentopf, a locksmith, was born in Güsten and moved to Berlin after the death of his parents in the early 1930s. In 1932 he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, he was tasked with producing illegal anti-fascist pamphlets and newspapers. 
On 18 August 1934 Siedentopf was arrested, and on 13 December he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment for "preparation for high treason".

William Williams (brewer)

William Williams (1803 – 26 April 1858) was an early settler in the Province of South Australia, known for establishing the Walkerville Brewery and for his work on the Kaurna language. He was Deputy Colonial Storekeeper for some time.
Early days in South Australia.
Williams arrived in the new colony at Holdfast Bay on 8 November 1836 aboard , one of the ships of the "First Fleet of South Australia".
On 5 January 1837 Williams was appointed as a constable, along with Joseph Lee, at an annual salary of £30, with William Archer Deacon as chief constable. He was sent with a commission comprising George Stevenson (secretary to Governor Hindmarsh), Thomas Bewes Strangways and Henry Jickling, to investigate disturbances on Kangaroo Island which had occurred in September 1836. The three constables were sworn in on 7 March 1837. There were frequent drunken brawls owing to an abundant supply of rum on the island. However his appointment was terminated within about six months, in July of that year.
Deputy Colonial Storekeeper.
Williams was Deputy Colonial Storekeeper (an office involving responsibility for all government stores) to Thomas Gilbert, working at the "Government Iron Stores [on] Montefiore Hill". The location of the Store was at the place known by the Kaurna people as Tininyawardli (or Tinninyawodli), which was just south of where Strangways Terrace was later built, in North Adelaide. It is near Piltawodli, which name has been adopted for Park 1 of the Adelaide parklands.
Involvement with Kaurna people and language.
Williams, along with James Cronk, who also arrived on "Africaine", made a deliberate effort to find and communicate with the local Aboriginal people, the Kaurna, or "Adelaide tribe". He was observed to make friends with a group of local people near Glenelg within a couple of weeks of arrival, and Cronk made an effort to learn the Kaurna language early. Both men were reportedly "great favorites of the natives", and became designated interpreters by the colonial officials. On 1 November 1838 they both assisted the Protector of Aborigines, William Wyatt, when Governor Gawler first met the local people, including Onkaparinga Jack and Captain Jack (a.k.a. Murlawirrapurka and Kadlitpinna, both native constables).
His work entitled "A vocabulary of the language of the Aborigines of the Adelaide district, and other friendly tribes, of the Province of South Australia" was self-published in 1839, to be sold in London as well as Adelaide. In the preface, he writes respectfully and affectionately of the Kaurna people. Williams also created a list of 377 Kaurna words, published in the "Southern Australian" on 15 May 1839 and republished in the "The South Australian Colonist" on 14 July 1840. This list included eight Kaurna place-names from around the city, and three from the northern area, including Patawalonga and Willunga.
In April 1839, Williams accompanied police and Aboriginal trackers, including Kadlitpinna, as interpreter on an expedition to the Lyndoch Valley area to the north of Adelaide, to bring murderers of a shepherd called Duffield to justice. Williams' account of the expedition was published in the "South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register" in May.
Career as merchant and brewer.
Hindley Street hotels.
Williams was the second person in the Province of South Australia to hold a liquor licence, applying for two licences on 16 June 1837 (one for wine, beer and other malt liquors, and the other for spirits), and probably the third brewer (the first two being Anthony Lillyman and then John Warren). He first purchased the eastern moiety of Town Acre 74, in Hindley Street in May 1838, opening a pub called the Grazier's Hotel. He then started trading in cattle, and also did business in timber and land, and then engaged his brother-in-law Edward Catchlove built a grander establishment named the Victoria Hotel.
This was replaced a year later by an even more upmarket establishment of the same name built over the road on a portion of Town Acre 51 (on the northern side, now no. 94 Hindley Street) and opened in March 1840. The earlier building was sold to the South Australian Club, a private gentlemen's club for the elite, for £2200, and was later the Club House Hotel.
In December 1939 Williams announced in the "South Australian Record" that the opening of the new hotel was imminent, "for the accommodation of families and gentlemen arriving in the colony, and where every possible attention will be paid to the comfort of those who may honour him with their patronage. The hotel will consist of one large public diningroom, three smaller ones private, several double and single bed-rooms, subscription billiard-room, most comfortable, airy, and extensive livery stables, stockyard, etc. N.B. The stable is now open for the reception of horses. There is a plentiful supply of hay and corn, and a most experienced groom, who is well known to most of the colonists".
The Victoria Hotel was later owned and run by "Mrs. G. Taylor", niece of Jane Williams (née Catchlove), for at least 30 years after taking it over in 1876.
Walkerville Brewery.
After leasing out the new Victoria, Williams traded in real estate on the Adelaide plains, building enough capital to build the Walkerville Brewery in 1847. The brewery was co-founded with William Colyer, but the partnership was dissolved late the same year, and Colyer returned to England. Williams commissioned architect Thomas Price in 1846 to erect buildings in Fuller Street, including malthouse, store and other buildings. Williams was found insolvent 1851, but only had his certificate annulled in 1853.
Church.
Williams gained notoriety in 1851 for his obstruction to the formation of the Walkerville Anglican Church committee, although according to the church website, Williams gave the land on which the church was built in 1848.
Family.
Williams married Jane Catchlove (1811 – 20 April 1885) on 2 July 1837. Jane arrived in South Australia in November 1836 aboard with her father Edward William Catchlove and three brothers and sisters. Henry Catchlove of Hindmarsh Brewery was an uncle.
William and Jane had eight children, including:
The newspaper announcement of Mary's marriage says that she was "niece to the late Colonel Richardson Williams Huey".
Death.
Williams died on 26 April 1858 in Sturt Street, destitute. A subscription organised to benefit his widow and seven remaining children was well patronised.

BYD Yuan

The BYD Yuan is a subcompact crossover SUV that was launched by BYD in March 2016, slotting below the BYD Song compact crossover. It is currently available only as an all-electric vehicle. Previously, a gasoline version and a hybrid version were offered. The gasoline version was sold since 2015 as the BYD S1 before being renamed and becoming part of the Yuan family. In some markets the S1 name was kept, and reused even for the all-electric Yuan. The BYD S2 is an all-electric subcompact crossover that is essentially a rebadged Yuan, shorter than the Yuan and the S1 (4100 mm vs. 4360 mm) and launched in 2019.
The second generation model called Yuan Plus was revealed in July 2021, featuring slightly larger dimensions and a more upmarket design.
First generation.
The BYD Yuan is the fourth BYD product and the third BYD crossover using the Chinese dynasty naming system, following the BYD Song compact crossover, the BYD Tang mid-size crossover and the BYD Qin compact sedan. Just like they did with the BYD Song, BYD has decided to use the same name ("Yuan") for the entire powertrain range, including a gasoline version, a hybrid version and an electric version (previously the gasoline version was known as the S1, while the hybrid and electric versions used the Yuan nameplate from the beginning).
BYD S1.
The BYD S1 is a gasoline-powered subcompact crossover launched by BYD in 2015. Besides the Chinese market, it was also offered in the Philippines. In the Chinese market, with the introduction of the Yuan nameplate in 2016, the S1 was renamed and was since sold as the gasoline version of the Yuan.
In some non-Chinese markets, the old S1 name was kept, despite the renaming of the vehicle in China. Even the all-electric variant of the Yuan was known in some markets as the S1 EV.
BYD Yuan facelift and Yuan EV.
In 2018, the BYD Yuan was facelifted, with the new "Dragon Face" styling of the front end, in line with all the other "dynasty" series products. The all-electric Yuan EV360 was also launched with prices ranging from 79,900 yuan to 99,900 yuan. The BYD Yuan EV360 has a 43.2kWh battery with a maximum range of . There is also the BYD Yuan EV535 with a larger, 53.2 kWh battery.
2020 Yuan EV.
As of August 2020, the only variants of the Yuan advertised by BYD in China are all-electric. Alongside the 2019 BYD Yuan EV360 (42 kWh battery), the 2020 BYD Yuan EV is offered, with two battery options: 40.62 kWh and 53.22 kWh. According to the NEDC norm, the range with the larger battery is .
Yuan Pro (2021 facelift).
The Yuan EV received a facelift for the 2021 model year called the Yuan Pro. The Yuan Pro features a redesigned front fascia in the same style as the BYD Han EV. In terms of performance, the Yuan Pro is available with a single motor producing 136 hp and a torque of 210 N·m. The Yuan Pro is equipped with a 50.1-kWh lithium iron phosphate "blade battery" developed by BYD that is capable of a NEDC range of 401km.
The interior is largely carried over from the pre-facelift model with the 10.1-inch multimedia screen, and is integrated with the DiLink3.0 intelligent connected system featuring voice command, voice notifications, Bluetooth phone calls, phone connectivity and mobile onboard television.
BYD S2.
The BYD S2 is an all-electric subcompact crossover, shorter than the Yuan and the S1 (4100 mm vs 4360 mm) and sold in China since 2019. The battery capacity is 40.62 kWh.
Second generation (Yuan Plus).
News of a second-generation model surfaced in July 2021, with the name being Yuan Plus to differentiate it from the regular Yuan that is still on the market. Both models are expected to be sold concurrently. The Yuan Plus is based on BYD's e-Platform 3.0 and is equipped with a 204 hp motor providing 330 N·m of torque, with the power coming from BYD's self-developed "blade battery".

C. Tangana

Antón Álvarez Alfaro (born July 16, 1990), better known as C. Tangana, is a Spanish rapper from Madrid, Spain. He is a member of the rap group Agorazein. He began his musical career in 2005 under the pseudonym Crema, with a demo called "Él Es Crema". Tangana has headlined the Primavera Sound festival. In 2020, he was named one of the most influential people and most creative artists in Spain by "Forbes".
Early life.
Álvarez was born in July 1990 in Madrid from Galician and Madrileño parents. In 2005 he started making music under the alias Crema.
Career.
2005–2007: First steps as Crema.
In 2005, he gained recognition as Crema as his freestyle demos began spreading online. He focused on rap music and released a seven-track EP titled "Él Es Crema" (2005) and then two more ("Madrid Files" and "Septiembre") in 2006. After finishing his baccalaureate he studied philosophy at the Complutense University of Madrid.
2011–2016: Agorazein.
Álvarez formed the band Agorazein with a group of friends in 2011. That year he released a work entitled "C. Tangana", which was generally well-received, attracted many new followers, and was adopted by Álvarez as his new stage name. In 2011 the band released their debut album in Spanish as independent artists titled "Kind of Red". Between 2011 and 2012 Álvarez self-released two albums: "C. Tangana" (2011) and "LOVE'S" (2012).
Tangana had replaced his particular style of short and direct phrases with short Anglicized phrases. While playing music, he made a living working in a Pans and Company and in a Vodafone call center. He began to shy away from the media in January 2013 because he did not feel comfortable with it. In 2014 he released his first EP as an independent artist titled "Trouble + Presidente". In 2015 he left his job to fully work on music. Agorazein released their final album "Siempre" in November 2016 and have been on an indefinite hiatus since then.
2016–2017: Record deal and "Ídolo".
In 2016, Tangana signed a record deal with Warner Chappell Music and started working regularly with friend and producer Alizzz. His first release as a signed artist was "Antes de Morirme", a flamenco-pop collaboration with then-girlfriend Rosalía. The song was a sleeper hit until late 2018, when Rosalía's career started growing internationally and the song was included in the soundtrack of the Spanish Netflix show "Élite". Tangana continued releasing songs throughout 2016. In 2017, Álvarez embarked on a tour in Latin America called C. Tangana Latino Tour. When the tour finished, he announced his official agreement with the record company Sony Music Entertainment. In April he released the lead single off his debut album titled "Espabilao". One month later, "Mala Mujer" was released on digital platforms as the album's second single. The song became wildly popular in Spain and in parts of Latin America. The track became a top-five hit in Spain, was named song of the summer, certified three times platinum there, and was also certified gold in the United States. A remix featuring Farruko and French Montana was released in September. Later, C. Tangana performed the track at LOS40 Music Awards 2017, where he was awarded Best New Artist of the Year. The music video for "Mala Mujer" also received a nomination for "Best National Video". He was also nominated at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Spanish Act. His first studio album "Ídolo" was released on digital download and streaming platforms on October 5, 2017. In December 2017 he released "Guerrera" alongside Dellafuente, which became a top 20 hit in Spain and was certified two times platinum.
2018–2019: "Avida Dollars".
In January 2018, Tanagana released the lead single of his debut mixtape as a signed artist: "Still Rapping" with Steve Lean. The song peaked at 86th on the PROMUSICAE chart. In March he released the mixtape's second single "Llorando en la Limo", produced and featuring Alizzz, which peaked at number twelve on the chart and became another summer hit in Spain. The mixtape, "Avida Dollars", was released on digital platforms on April 20, 2018, presented with two sold-out shows at La Riviera in Madrid. and was well received by music critics. Since then, Tangana started releasing independent singles such as "Bien Duro", released in June 2018, which peaked at number six in Spain and became the 32nd most sold song in the country. It was certified double platinum. In October, he released his first international collaboration with American singer Becky G. The song, titled "Booty" peaked at number 3 in Spain and became the 93rd best-selling song in Spain in only two months. "Booty" was also certified double platinum in Spain and platinum in the United States. Its music video was nominated for Best Music Video at the 2020 Premios Odeón. In November 2018, Tangana was awarded with two Latin Grammy Awards for writing Rosalía's "Malamente". He took home the awards for Best Alternative Song and Best Urban Fusion/Performance. The track was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. He later received the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year and for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album for his contribution on eight songs on Rosalía's sophomore album "El Mal Querer". In November, he also released "Un Veneno", a minimal, new flamenco track featuring Niño de Elche. It received critical acclaim due to its rawness. On November 21 he performed it on "Operación Triunfo 2018". After the performance, he left the stage aggressively despite being scheduled to give an interview, which was received negatively on Twitter. The media coverage the situation received caused an increase in "Un Veneno" streams, making it reach the number two spot on the PROMUSICAE chart and be certified gold in Spain.
During 2019, Tangana continued releasing independent singles. In January he collaborated with Brazilian rapper MC Bin Laden and once again with Alizzz on "Pa' Llamar Tu Atención". The track reached number three on the PROMUSICAE chart. In February he collaborated with Alizzz and Dellafuente once again on "París", which eventually became Tangana's fifth top 10 single. In March 2019 he performed at Lollapalooza Argentina and Chile. He also offered to do a show in Lima and did a showcase in Miami. In April 2019 he moved to Los Angeles. He attended the 2019 "Billboard" Latin Music Awards and performed at the after-party. While in America, he worked with Chilean-American singer Paloma Mami on his song "No Te Debí Besar", released in September 2019, which marked Mami's debut on the Spanish music charts as well as a new top three hit for Tangana. That same year he collaborated with Argentine rapper Duki and Colombian singer Lao Ra on "5 Stars" and "Picaflor" respectively. A couple of months later, Tangana released "Yelo" alongside Alizzz. In February he collaborated with Natti Natasha on his own track "Viene Y Va" and alongside Tainy and former Fifth Harmony member Lauren Jauregui on the Puerto Rican's "Nada", included in his album "The Kids That Grew Up On Reggaeton" (2020).
2020–present: "Bien" and "El Madrileño".
In April 2020, Tangana moved to rap-pop and sadcore music with folk elements, leaving trap and hip hop. On April 24 he released "Nunca Estoy", which was very well-received by critics. It reached the top spot on the PROMUSICAE chart, and became Tangana's first number one hit in his career. The track sampled both "Cómo Quieres Que Te Quiera" by Rosario Flores and "Corazón Partío" by Alejandro Sanz. In May, Tangana announced his first EP as a signed artist, "Bien", which was released through Sony Music on May 14, 2020, and debuted number one in Spain. He allied with Little Spain Productions to produce, write and direct his upcoming music videos. In September, Tangana revealed to "Forbes" that his upcoming studio album would be very different from his previous releases and that it would be named "El Madrileño".
On October 8, Tangana released the lead single of "El Madrileño". "Demasiadas Mujeres" became popular in Spain; it debuted at the top of the PROMUSICAE chart and being gold-certified in only a week for selling over 20,000 copies. The song contrasted with everything Tangana had done and included a Holy Week marching band from Cádiz. The song included a message of frustration and elements of folk. Its music video included a scene of Tangana's own funeral and references to his past relationships with Rosalía and Berta Vázquez. On November 6, Tangana released "Tú Me Dejaste de Querer", which he called "the most important song of his career". He defined the track as a combination of rumba and bachata with elements of flamenco music. The track broke the record for the most-streamed song in Spain in a 24-hour period with 1.6 million national streams. Internationally, "Tú Me Dejaste de Querer" debuted at number 31 on the Spotify Global chart, marking the first entry of Tangana on the list.
In January 2021, Tangana released the single "Comerte Entera" featuring Toquinho on "El Madrileño".
C. Tangana released "El Madrileño" on February 26, 2021. The album broke records in streaming services, and Tangana became the first Spanish artist to reach #1 in the global new albums list and place the whole album's tracklist in the top 25 of Top 100 Songs in Spain.
Musical style.
With Agorazein, he attracted the attention of people due to a blend of good rhythms and melodies that conveyed teenage rebelliousness and sadness. In contrast with rap, Tangana's soft sounds became as important as the voice, which started to gain acoustic treatment.
In 2015, he adopted a more traditional lyric style, but continued with the most creative part of his music. In his songs, Tangana expresses individualistic ideals. On occasion, some mass media have interpreted sexist sentences in his songs. Regarding to his political ideas, he said that he does not believe in the representative democracy.
Influences.
Tangana discovered rap music from the Beastie Boys album "III Communication" and the feature film "Fear of a Black Hat", as mentioned in his song "Diez Años". Among all the influences, he also mentioned "If You're Reading This It's Too Late" by Drake, and other singers like Pharrell Williams and Kanye West because of their ability and inclination to innovate and to attract the public's attention. He stated a few times that he listens to all musical genres because "everything has an interesting side". Tangana's music is not the result of particular singers, but the product of musical movements and trends; although he recently said in an interview that his idol was the "King of Pop" Michael Jackson.
Feuds.
Tangana has been involved in several feuds with other artists during his career.
The most infamous one was the beef with the rap group Los Chikos del Maíz. In May 2014, he recorded the video clip of his song "Alligators" where he blatantly promoted Lacoste. In September of that year, Los Chikos del Maíz released their song "Tú al Gulag y yo a California" to parodize Tangana because of the advertising. The group gave a concert in Madrid on May 17, 2015, where Tangana allegedly attacked the singer of the rap group, Nega. Tangana confirmed the allegations later that year with his song "Nada", throughout which he describes the fight. He later confessed that he regretted the punch in a radio interview for the program "Yu Vodafone". In May 2016, Los Chikos del Maíz released their new song "Los Pollos Hermanos". Four hours later, Tangana released "Los Chicos de Madriz" as a response. Many other people saw themselves involved in that conflict, like Pablo Iglesias, a Spanish leftist politician, who supported Nega.
In 2017, Tangana's new album was released and he feuded against Kaydy Cain with his song "No Te Pegas". Cain replied with his song "Perdedores del Barrio".
Tangana also fought with Spanish singer Yung Beef after a joint interview for the Primavera Sound Festival 2018 in which they argued about the music industry and their position in it. Later, Tangana released song "El Rey Soy Yo/I Feel Like Kanye", to which Yung Beef answered with "Yes indeed / I feel like Kim K-RIP Pucho". Tangana then released "Forfri" and a statement in which he claimed that Yung Beef "was just being used by the industry and he didn't even notice".

Isilo (elephant)

Isilo (c. 1956 – 2014) was one of South Africa’s largest African elephants and the largest living tusker in the southern hemisphere before his death. He was known as a "tusker," a male elephant with tusks weighing over 100 pounds.
Although Isilo died of natural causes relating to old age, his death attracted international media attention because his tusks, considered a National Heritage artifact, were missing when his body was discovered.
Background.
Isilo was an African elephant that lived in Tembe Elephant Park in South Africa, home to some of the largest elephants in the world. Isilo’s name means “King” in Zulu.
Born during the late 1950s, he was estimated to have been at least 58 years old when he died.
Isilo weighed about 6.5 tonnes to 7 tonnes. Isilo's tusks were estimated to be more than 3 meters (9 feet) long. The right tusk weighed about 65 kg (143 pounds) and the left about 60 kg (132 pounds).
Isilo was a major attraction at the Tembe Elephant Park due to his immense size and his placid gentle nature. He was world-famous and even had his own Facebook page with thousands of followers.
Death.
Isilo died of natural causes in an area known to be his home range in a southwest section of the park around 10 January 2014. His carcass was discovered in late March 2014 and his death was announced on April 4, 2014 by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and Ernest Robbertse, Manager of the Tembe Elephant Park Lodge.
His tusks were missing and had been removed one after the other over a period of two weeks. They had most likely been taken by suspected rhino poachers and transported over the border into Mozambique where tusks are shipped to the Far East, the world's biggest market for ivory.
Isilo's tusks were estimated to have a black market value of approximately R3 million (about $250,000. US).
Reactions to the death.
Isilo's death resulted in international media attention due to his celebrity status and the loss of his tusks, considered a National Heritage artifact.
Isilo's tusks were the heritage of the Tembe clan, part owners and ancestral custodians of the Tembe Elephant Park. Inkosi Mabhudu Tembe, chief of the Tembe clan, planned to offer the tusks to South Africa for display at the King Shaka Airport in Durban to promote tourism. In April 2014, Inkosi Tembe offered a R100 000 (approx $8600 US) reward for the return of the missing tusks.
Other large tuskers.
In Tsavo East National Park in Kenya in June 2014, Satao the biggest tusker in East Africa – with ivory as big as Isilo's – was killed by poachers with poisoned spears.
Books and other media.
Isilo is acknowledged in two books by Dr. Johan Marais, who believes that the largest elephants in the world can be found in the Tembe National Elephant Park:
James Currie, international wildlife expert, was the last person to film Isilo before his disappearance. In 2016, he launched a Kickstarter campaign to film "Last of the Big Tuskers" a documentary about the largest elephants on earth and what is being done to ensure their survival. The documentary was released in October 2018.

Pretty Shining People

"Pretty Shining People" is a song by English singer-songwriter George Ezra. The song was written by Ezra and produced by Cam Blackwood. It was released as a digital download on 2 March 2019, as the first promotional single from Ezra's second studio album "Staying at Tamara's". The song peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart and number 40 on the Irish Singles Chart. On 8 March 2019 it became the fifth single from the album.
Critical reception.
In a review for "NME", Nick Reilly said, "Opener 'Happy Smiling [sic] People' sees Ezra anchoring an infectious chorus around dark and world-weary lyrics: "What a terrible time to be alive if you're prone to overthinking", he croons, before offering a message of upbeat and hearty resilience ("Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together")."
Music video.
A lyric video to accompany the release of "Pretty Shining People" was first released onto YouTube on 2 March 2019 at a total length of three minutes and forty-one seconds.
The official music video, directed by Michael Cumming, was released on 8 March 2019. It begins with Ezra sitting nervously in a room labelled as "Record label HQ, London" while holding a white disk with "Pretty Shining People Demo George Ezra" written on it in permanent marker. A young girl then approaches Ezra, shakes his hand and takes him to another room. Ezra then begins auditioning the song in front of a table of young children who begin to take notes and appear to look unimpressed with Ezra's performance. The children then begin to softly lip sync the song. As Ezra begins performing the chorus, the scene changes to a young child in a suit presenting a presentation to the children from the previous scene. The presentation covers topics such as Ezra's interests; these are jigsaws, metal detecting, trains and badminton, Ezra's genre and Ezra's personality, which is labelled as "BORING". The scene then returns to Ezra looking confused that the children aren't impressed by his audition. The scene then changes to Ezra in a suit and two children in a room called the "smile chamber" where Ezra is shown a card with different smiles that he has to then copy as photographers take photographs of him. Similarly to his audition, the children are not impressed with Ezra's efforts and one child begins to help him adjust his smile. The scene then returns to the presentation, this time about Ezra's image with a bar chart with the labels "catchiness" and "edginess". The bars begin to increase and decrease melodically and the word "EDGINESS" appears on the presentation screen. The scene then changes to Ezra trying on different outfits as two of the children continue to lip sync the song and look unimpressed by Ezra's original clothing. He then comes out wearing a camouflage tracksuit which is approved by the children. The scene is then changed to a room called the "Dance Zone" where Ezra, in the tracksuit, is dancing to the song with some of the children. It then returns to Ezra's audition, where the children are still not impressed. Slowly, however, the children get into the song and eventually get up and begin jumping, singing and dancing. The scene then changes repeatedly between Ezra's audition, Ezra taking a selfie with two girls, a young boy showcasing some possible Ezra album cover ideas and two young boys dressing Ezra with a man bag. Ezra's audition then ends and the children applaud him. The video then ends with a short clip of Ezra signing a recording contract.

It was matched in eastern Tibet by the Do-kham Regional Military Commission. Both were subordinate to the Shaanxi Regional Military Commission; or in western Tibet to the Ngari Commanding Tribal Office. Both were deactivated in 1618. Some scholars claim that their existence proves Tibet's suzerainty to China during this period; others that they were nominal agencies, as the reins of government are still under Tibetan aristocrats and monks.

<doc id="56720828" url="?curid=56720828" title="1939–40 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season">
1939–40 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season

The 1939–40 Northern Rugby Football League season was an emergency season of English rugby league fixtures necessitated by the outbreak of the Second World War. The regular league season had started at the end of August 1939, but on the outbreak of war all sport was suspended. When government permission for sport to be resumed was given, the league was reorganised into two regional competitions, Yorkshire and Lancashire. The winners of each league playing against each other to decide the overall champions. The Yorkshire competition was won by Bradford Northern who beat Swinton, winners of the Lancashire competition, in the two-legged league final.
The season also saw the resumption of County Cup competition, as well as some representative matches arranged to raise funds for the British Red Cross. The Challenge Cup competition, traditionally run alongside the league, was not played for the first time since 1919.
Planned season.
The planned 1939–40 season had begun as scheduled on Saturday 26 August 1939 with 27 clubs starting the season. This was one less than the previous season as St Helens Recs had disbanded at the end of the 1938–39 season. The withdrawal of St Helens Recs required a change in the way fixtures were organised. With 28 clubs in the league, each club was a member of the 14 team Lancashire League or the 14 team Yorkshire League. The actual geographical split of clubs was 15 clubs based in Yorkshire and 13 in Lancashire, so Halifax played as a member of the Lancashire League. Each teams' fixture list comprised a home and away fixture against all the teams in their county league (26), as well as home and away fixtures against seven teams in the other county league (14) for a total of 40 games.
With only 27 clubs the League's secretary, John Wilson, proposed a 36-game season for each club with Halifax remaining in the Lancashire league, and Dewsbury, who were the lowest finishing Yorkshire team in the previous season, playing as a member of neither county league. For the purposes of determining fixture lists Dewsbury would be considered the 14th team of both county leagues. Excepting Dewsbury, each team's fixture list would comprise the other teams in their own county league (24 games) together with six teams from the other county (12 games). Dewsbury's opponents would be nine clubs from each county.
At the League's annual general meeting on 7 June 1939 the clubs accepted Wilson's proposal regarding the positions of Halifax and Dewsbury, but voted for a 40-game fixture list instead of Wilson's 36 game proposal. The fixture lists were issued later in June. Each team, except Dewsbury, had home and away fixtures against all the teams in their own county league (24 games). They also had home and away fixtures against eight teams in the other county league (16 games). Dewsbury's fixture list comprised home and away fixtures against 10 teams from each county league.
A full programme of games was played up to Saturday 2 September. By that date most clubs had played two or three games as some clubs had played midweek matches.
Suspension of the League.
On Monday 4 September the day after the declaration of war, all rugby league games and all other spectator sports and public entertainments were suspended by provisions of the Prohibition of Public Entertainments (Defence) Order, one of numerous orders made following the enactment of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939. As a result, some clubs like Wigan and Salford announced they were closing for the duration of the war and that their players were released.
One issue clubs had to consider was what to do with the monies paid for season-tickets, the holders of which may have only seen one or two games. Barrow, for one, resolved to repay season-ticket holders less a deduction for games seen, while Oldham decided not to give any refunds stating, "We are up against it and must appeal to our members to make this sacrifice".
Under the defence regulations and air raid precautions, all areas of the country were designated as evacuation, neutral or reception areas depending on the assessment of an area as an enemy target and its ability to receive people from the evacuation areas. The defence regulations allowed for the resumption of sporting events within reception or neutral areas and on 9 September the Home Secretary issued the Public Entertainments (Restriction) Order allowing events to go ahead outside evacuation areas. Attendances were limited to 8,000 or 15,000 at grounds with a capacity over 60,000.
On 11 September the Rugby League Council agreed to clubs playing friendlies on the following two Saturdays, while the League Secretary, John Wilson, arranged a programme of games. Players were to be paid 10s per match and their travelling expenses, while the minimum entrance fee was set at 6d. The meeting also appointed a wartime committee to run the league for the duration of the war.
Seven games were played on 16 September and eleven on 23 September. A further change in the defence orders allowed games to go ahead in evacuation areas as long as the consent of the local chief constable had been obtained.
County competitions.
Wilson's proposal, which was accepted on 11 September, was for the league to run as two parallel county competitions, a Yorkshire Competition and a Lancashire Competition under the umbrella name of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Emergency Period League. The leagues would be played on a simple home and away basis; gate money was to be split equally between the two clubs after deducting player expenses and travel expenses for 15 players of the away club. Players' expenses were limited to 10s per game plus meal expenses if they had to travel more than to an away game. These allowances replaced any previous contractual arrangements between the players and the clubs and in effect removed the professional status from the players. Referees were to be allowed 10s plus travel expenses and touch judges 5s plus travel expenses. Players were also allowed to play for another club if that club was closer to home or work, subject to agreement of their first club. This was to alleviate travelling for players who worked away.
No inter-competition games were planned, but in January 1940 it was proposed and agreed that there should be a two-legged final between the winner of each competition to decide the overall league champions. Clubs were asked to notify Wilson as soon as possible if they intended to play in the competitions. In the end all 27 clubs, including those like Salford and Wigan who had previously decided to cease operating, had entered when the fixture list was issued.
The rules also allowed alternative venues to be used if a club's home ground was unavailable, either temporarily or permanently. Broughton Rangers home ground, Belle Vue was unavailable to them all season so they played at a variety of other grounds, while Salford and Swinton shared Swinton's Station Road.
Player protest.
Even before the season started players at Bradford Northern, Halifax and Huddersfield protested that the expense limit of 10s per game was insufficient and that they would not play unless the expenses were increased. The Lord Mayor of Bradford, T. J. Robinson had anticipated the players' stance. At a lunch for the wartime committee, he was reported as saying "the committee members would have difficulty in getting first-class footballers, used to getting £4 or £5 to accept remuneration of 10s per match, but no doubt the difficulties would be surmounted". The players most opposed to the expense limit were those of Bradford Northern who were unanimous in their opposition and had made it clear to the club secretary that they were not prepared to play for 10s per game. The secretary had informed Wilson of this asking for a special meeting of the clubs to discuss the issue. At this stage Wilson did not consider discussion appropriate unless 20 or more of the clubs requested it. The Huddersfield players also informed their club committee that they were not prepared to play on the following Saturday. At Halifax the secretary stated reports of a strike were exaggerated and that the "players were quite willing, indeed they were anxious to play but they were not prepared to run the risk of losing the jobs they had got, or of being off work, for the small amount they were permitted to receive".
The chairman of the Rugby League Council, G.F. Hutchins, responded by asking all players to give the 10s expenses a month's trial after which the issue would be reviewed. While players at St. Helens accepted the 10s limit, at Barrow team selection for Saturday was delayed because of the issue; while some clubs, including Halifax, Dewsbury and Batley, called for an increase in the limit.
On Friday 29 September the Halifax players agreed to play but remained dissatisfied by the expense allowance; the Bradford players remained adamant leaving the club no alternative but to inform their opponents for Saturday, Hull Kingston Rovers that the game could not go ahead. Players from many clubs met on 2 October and agreed to continue to press the issue with the Rugby Football League, but they would play "on Saturday in order to keep faith with the public". After the second weekend of the competitions, the Rugby League Council met to discuss the expenses issue and agreed a doubling of the expenses limit to £1. Expenses for referees were also increased to £1, but touch judges' expenses remained unchanged at 5s. Also, clubs could make an additional payment of 5s to each player for away games played in Barrow or Hull due to the extra travelling time needed. To increase the likelihood that gates would be adequate, the minimum entry for a game was increased to 1s but remained at 6d for women, children and any uniformed members of the armed forces. The players responded by welcoming the rise but asked the Rugby League Council to consider changing the system to a payment of 25s to players on the winning team and 15s to the members of the losing team. The players felt this would increase competitiveness in the games. The wartime committee met the following week but made no response to the player's suggestion. Bonuses were not discussed further except at the end of the season when the league awarded monetary prizes rather than medals.
Yorkshire competition.
With 15 teams the fixture list for the Yorkshire competition contained 28 fixtures for each team with the season end date being 11 May. Until Christmas 1939 the competition progressed as planned although at least one game was concluded early; Hull v Batley on 21 October was ended after 65 minutes due to an air raid warning. The last week of December 1939 was the start of the third coldest winter of the 20th century and the most severe in the United Kingdom since 1895. Heavy snow and prolonged cold periods, together with the lack of material to protect the pitches, meant that after the games played on Boxing Day 1939 no games were played in Yorkshire until 24 February when a single match, Hull F.C. v Leeds beat the weather; it was the following Saturday, 2 March 1940, before a full schedule resumed. A backlog of over 100 games built up and it became apparent that it would be impossible to complete the fixtures by the end of April without many midweek games being played. The decision was taken to extend the season. The clubs were urged to complete their fixtures by 4 May, but as the backlog grew the date was moved to 11 May with the Championship final scheduled for 18 and 25 May. The extension required a ballot of all the clubs as the games' by-laws specified that they could not be played between the second Saturday in May and the last Saturday in August. Despite all the urging, the games did not finish on time. By 31 May there were still three fixtures outstanding. Hull F.C. had away fixtures against Batley and Keighley to play, and Hull Kingston Rovers were still to play Dewsbury at home. These games never were played as Hull F.C. reported in July that their two fixtures were unplayed and both Keighley and Batley had withdrawn from the Yorkshire Cup ending their seasons in May due to problems raising teams. With two points awarded for a win, the non-playing of these three games had no bearing on the outcome of the competition. Bradford secured the title with a game to spare when they beat Hull Kingston Rovers on 13 May giving them a three-point lead over Huddersfield, and a six-point lead over Hull F.C.
Lancashire competition.
The 12 teams of the Lancashire competition each had 22 fixtures to play. A season end date of 2 March was given when the fixture list was issued. Like the Yorkshire competition, the Lancashire competition progressed well until the end of 1939 but was hit badly by the hard winter. The absence of games was not as long as the barren spell experienced in Yorkshire; in the first two weeks of January 1940 three games were played all in the Lancashire competition. After that it was the last weekend in February before any more games were played. Catching up on the outstanding fixtures required some games to be scheduled close to each other. Oldham and Warrington rescheduled the two games between the clubs. Both were played over the Easter weekend, Oldham at home on Saturday and Warrington at home on Monday.
With a smaller backlog of games and fewer fixtures to be played, by the end of May there was only one fixture left to be played—Oldham v Rochdale. The game had previously been postponed twice at the request of Rochdale who then proposed the fixture be played on 1 June. However Oldham had already arranged a friendly against Huddersfield for the same day which they did not wish to postpone and instead proposed 8 June. Rochdale objected as they considered the outstanding league fixture should take precedence over a friendly. When Oldham refused, Rochdale wrote to the league and Oldham, stating that Rochdale did not intend to fulfil the fixture. The games' points were awarded to Oldham.
The title was won by Swinton on points difference ahead of Salford.
Championship play-off.
The Championship was decided by a two leg play-off between Swinton and Bradford Northern on a home and away basis. Bradford Northern won 37–22 on aggregate having won both legs.
First leg.
The first leg was played at Swinton's Station Rd on 18 May 1940 in front of a crowd of 4,800. Gate receipts totalled £237.
Swinton took a 3–0 lead when Hopkin scored a try. But within minutes Bradford took the lead as Harrison scored a try which Carmichael converted to put Bradford 5–3 ahead. Swinton regained the lead through a McGurk try, converted by Hodgson, cancelled out by Bradford's second try by Smith which Carmichael again converted. This gave Bradford a half-time lead 10–8.
In the second half it was Bradford who scored first with a Whitcombe try to which Carmichael added the conversion to make the score 15–8. Swinton reduced the gap to two points as Shaw scored with Hodgson converting. Bradford's fourth try came from a Swinton penalty kick that hit the post and rebounded into the field of play. It was gathered up by Bradford's Davies who ran the length of the pitch to score. A fifth try for Bradford, scored by Brogden, made the final score 21–13 to Bradford.
Second leg.
The second leg was played the following Saturday, 25 May 1940 at Odsal Stadium. The crowd was 11,271 generating gate receipts of £570.
Bradford made a number of changes for the first leg due to injuries and players unable to get time off work. Bradford scored first with a Ward try to which Swinton replied with a Hodgson drop goal. This was Swinton's only score of the first half. Bradford scored two more tries through Winnard and Whitcombe, one of which Carmichael converted to give Bradford an 11–2 lead at half-time.
Swinton got a try back in the second half, but another try by Winnard and a Carmichael conversion extended Bradford's lead to 16–5. Two Hodgson penalties, the second of which was kicked from very close to the halfway line making the kick approximately from the goal posts, improved Swinton's score. Shortly before the end Jenkins (Bradford) and Bowyer (Swinton) were sent off for fighting. As Swinton had already lost Hopkin to injury they finished the game with only 11 players on the field as the game ended 16–9 to Bradford.
Cup competitions.
Challenge Cup.
The Challenge Cup was suspended at the start of the war at the same time as all competitive games and it did not feature in the Rugby League's proposals for competitive football. As late as December 1939 the Lancashire County Committee were considering a proposal to reinstate the competition but the practicalities of scheduling and travel during wartime were considered too great to overcome.
Lancashire Cup.
Although all cup competitions had been suspended at the outbreak of the war, as the season progressed there were calls for the County Cup competitions to be re-introduced. In December 1939 the wartime committee gave permission for the Lancashire Cup to be played. All ties including the final were to be two-legged with the winner being decided by aggregate score. With only 12 clubs participating only four rounds of competition were needed and these were scheduled for March and April 1940. After the first round the six winning clubs were drawn for the second round with two teams being given byes into the semi-finals. The two teams given byes were Swinton and Widnes who went on to win their semi-final matches.
The winners of the cup were Swinton who won the first leg of the final 5–4 at Widnes' Naughton Park ground on 20 April. In the second leg at Station Road, at full time the score was 9–8 to Widnes making the aggregate score 13–13. Under the competition rules extra time had to be played and Swinton won 16–11 to win the Cup 21–15 on aggregate.
Yorkshire Cup.
Encouraged by the resumption of the Lancashire Cup, in December 1939 the Yorkshire clubs considered whether to reinstate the Yorkshire Cup but agreed to defer any decision until February 1940. At the club's February meeting it was agreed to ask the war-time committee for permission to play the competition on four consecutive Saturdays in May and June after the completion of the league season. As the request was made at the same time the league fixture backlog was increasing, the war-time committee arranged a postal ballot of all the clubs to amend the by-laws to allow games to be played in June; the vote to extend the season was carried 21–3 with 8 clubs not replying. A secondary proposal to pay match bonuses to players for cup games after the first round was rejected after a ballot of the clubs.
Unlike the Lancashire Cup, the Yorkshire Cup was to be a straightforward knockout competition. It was agreed that the first round fixtures would be those that had been drawn in May 1939 in anticipation of the Cup being at its regular dates in the season. The draw gave Huddersfield a bye; they would join the winners of the seven ties in the draw for the second round. Shortly before the first round ties were played on 1 June 1940, Batley, Bramley and Keighley all withdrew from the competition because they could not raise teams due to war work commitments or active service. The three ties were all awarded to their opponents.
The final was contested by Featherstone Rovers and Wakefield Trinity at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on 22 June 1940. Featherstone won 12–9 to win the Cup for the first time.
Lancashire Summer Competition.
In April 1940 eight of the Lancashire clubs agreed to play in a new league called the Lancashire Summer Competition. The teams were split into two groups of four with the two group leaders meeting in a single-legged play-off final on 22 June. The two groups, titled East and West comprised Barrow, Liverpool Stanley, Warrington and Wigan in the East group with Broughton Rangers, Leigh, Salford and Swinton in the West group. Players from the four teams who had decided not to enter were not allowed to play as guests in the competition. The games were to be played as a two-legged knockout tournament in the same manner as the Lancashire Cup.
Fixtures began on 11 May with Broughton Rangers playing Leigh, but within two weeks Barrow and Swinton withdrew from the competition. With only six teams left in the competition, the league committee decided to abandon the competition at the end of May.
Representative matches.
In October 1939 the league resolved to play three representative matches to raise funds for the Red Cross; England v Wales on 23 December 1939, Lancashire v Yorkshire at Barrow on 1 January 1940, and the 1936 Tourists v the Rest on 10 February 1940 at a venue to be confirmed.
The first game, England v Wales, was played at Odsal, Bradford on 23 December 1939. A crowd of 20,000 saw Wales win 16–3. The second game was scheduled for 1 January 1940 and was a match between representative teams of the Lancashire and Yorkshire clubs. It was postponed in December 1939 at the request of the Barrow club as the Barrow shipyards were not taking New Years Day, a Monday, as a holiday. Eventually played at Craven Park on 23 March before a crowd of 8,683, Yorkshire beat Lancashire 13–10 having been 2–10 behind at half-time.
The third game, postponed from 10 February, was played at Salford on 4 May between the 1936 Tourists (players from the 1936 team that toured Australia) and the 1940 Probables (players who probably would have toured Australia in 1940 had the war not intervened). Last minute changes in availability meant that the Tourists side included three Salford players who had not been part of the tour team. The 1940 Probables won the game 29–21 in front of a crowd of 7,000.
In total the three games generated £1,561 for the British Red Cross.
Finances.
The season was costly both to the Rugby Football League and to many clubs. The Rugby Football League had income of only £899 in the year to 31 May 1940 and lost £3,015, reducing its assets to £23,304. This compared to a loss of £1,710 in the previous year. The two County Leagues had mixed fortunes. Lancashire made a profit of £63 while Yorkshire made a loss of £121.
At club level many clubs reported losses, these ranged from £47 at Batley and £87 at Rochdale to £998 at Castleford and £1,314 at Wigan. A minority of clubs reported making a profit; St Helens £5 Oldham £114, Swinton £515 and Dewsbury £750, but these club were far fewer in number than the clubs reporting losses.

10 Minute School

10 Minute School (, abbreviated as 10MS) is an online educational platform in Bangladesh created in 2015 by internet entrepreneur Ayman Sadiq. The platform covers academic classes from classes 1 to 12 covering the entire academic syllabus of the Bangladesh schooling system, university admission subjects covering different branches of study, and skills training.
History.
Ayman Sadiq founded 10 Minute School in mid-2014 as a YouTube channel. Largely self-sponsored in the beginning, 10 Minute School did not initially have a website and solely reached students through educational infographics. It started creating video tutorials for Mathematics and English and eventually started taking live classes on Facebook. 10 Minute School went on to cover the entire academic syllabus from Class 1 to Class 12, university admission subjects covering topics from public and private university examinations and extensive software and skills training.
While one of the major challenges for organization back then was to find a suitable sponsor to fund its operational activities, it later came to be supported by telecom operator Robi Axiata Limited and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology.
Content.
, the website has produced 19440+ video lessons, 1114+ SmartBooks, 49530+ quizzes and 1300+ blogs.
Starting in the last few days of July 2020, ten minute school got into internet controversy because of its controversial content.

Prince Hodong of Goguryeo

Prince Hodong (; ? – November 32) was a prince of Goguryeo and the son of Daemusin.
Outline.
When Hodong, a child of Daemusin of Goguryeo, the third king of Goguryeo went Okjeo for hunting, he met Choi Ri () who was the king of Nakrang Kingdom. However, the kingdom's sovereignty is often disputed, which is often viewed as an independent kingdom by Korean scholars while Chinese and Japanese academic communities usually interpret the name Nakrang to be referring to Lelang Commandery.
For Hodong, Princess of Nakrang destroyed the drum and Oliphant by a sword, after that Goguryeo attacked Nakrang Kingdom. Choi Ri could not be prepared for that attack because the drum and Oliphant were destroyed and he could not know Goguryeo’s invasion. He only knew that the drums and Oliphant were destroyed after Goguryeo’s aggression, but there’s nothing to do but surrender to Goguryeo. At that time, Choi Ri killed Princess of Nakrang who destroyed the drum and Oliphant..
Hodong was a child of Hae clan () who was a stepmother of Daemusin of Goguryeo, so, the empress of Goguryeo afraid if Hodong become a crown prince by pushing aside her own son. The empress gave a slanderous report that Hodong plans rebellion to Daemusin of Goguryeo. After that Hodong committed suicide because if explain to that slander, he could leap to light of the empress’s iniquity and Daemusin of Goguryeo would get anxious about it.

2018 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council election

Elections to Tower Hamlets London Borough Council were held on 3 May 2018, the same day as other borough council elections in London. The directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets was also up for election.
Prior council composition.
Since the 2014 election the makeup of the Borough Council has changed considerably, with the second-placed Tower Hamlets First party removed from the Electoral Commission's register of political parties following election court findings that Tower Hamlets First did not operate any responsible financial scheme, nor in the manners as submitted in its registration as a political party, Lutfur Rahman's re-election to the post of Mayor was declared void, and the subsequent by-election was won by John Biggs of the Labour Party. The Labour Party controlled the council from the time of the by-election in June 2015 until one of its councillors defected to the Liberal Democrats in February 2017 over Brexit. Another of Labour's councillors, who served as the Speaker of the Council, was suspended by the party for 10 months in 2016, and again in March 2018, ending his term as an Independent; he went into the election as a candidate for People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets. Also represented was the Conservative Party.
The 2018 result saw Labour hold the mayoralty and re-gain control of the council, winning all but one of the seats won by Tower Hamlets First in 2014, as well as seats from the Conservatives. Rabina Khan, formerly of Tower Hamlets First, but now leader of the rival PATH, came second in the Mayoral election and was the only former Tower Hamlets First councillor to win a seat.
Electoral wards.
The election was held on the boundaries established by the Tower Hamlets (Electoral Changes) Order 2013, which reduced the size of the council and created new electoral wards. This was the second election on the new boundaries, after the 2014 election.
Results by ward.
Blackwall and Cubitt Town.
In October 2018, Pappu was suspended from the Labour group on the council on following a tirade of antisemitic posts on his social media. He subsequently apologised and was readmitted to the Labour Party.
Canary Wharf.
In February 2020, Wood resigned as Leader of the Opposition and as a Conservative in opposition to Brexit and the Housing Secretary, Robert Jenrick's decision to approve the building of the Westferry Printworks skyscrapers. He now sits as an Independent.
Shadwell.
In October 2018, Khan joined the Liberal Democrats after the People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets folded.

French ship Foudroyant (1691)

The Foudroyant was a First Rank ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, the lead vessel in the two-ship "Foudroyant" Class (her sister being the "Merveilleux"). 
This ship was ordered in January 1690 to be built at Brest Dockyard, and on 9 July she was allotted the name "Foudroyant". The designer and builder of both ships was Blaise Pangalo. They were three-decker ships without forecastles. The "Foudroyant" was launched on 5 March 1691 and completed in June of the same year.
She was initially armed with 90 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-four 12-pounders on the upper deck, and ten 6-pounders on the quarterdeck. However she was reduced to 84 guns before the end of 1691. 
The new ship took part in the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692, where she was the flagship of "Chef d'Escadre" Ferdinand, Comte de Relingue. Following the battle she and her sister "Merveilleux" put into La Hogue on the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula where they were attacked and burnt by Anglo-Dutch naval forces on 2 June 1692.
A new ship was immediately ordered to be built at Brest and given the same name; this was launched in December 1692. However, in March 1693 this ship exchanged names with the ship ordered at Brest in January 1693, so it was the latter which bore the name "Foudroyant" when launched in November 1693.

Wanjiwalku

The Wanjiwalku were an indigenous Australian people of the state of New South Wales.
Language.
Norman Tindale, who had worked intensely with his informant George Dutton on the Wanjiwalku language, argued that, though separate tribes, both the Wanjiwalku and their western neighbours, the Malyangapa, spoke the same dialect. Later studies by Luise Hercus and Peter Austin have determined that Wanjiwalku was a dialect of Paakantyi, while Malyangapa was morphological almost identical to the language spoken by the Yardliyawara, and to be classified as a member of the Yarli dialect cluster.
Country.
The Wanjiwalku were estimated by Tindale to have had around of tribal land extending from the vicinity of Milparinka to White Cliffs, and running east from close to Mount Arrowsmith as far as the area near Tongo Lake. Their lands took in Yancannia and the area east of Lake Bancannia.
Edward Micklethwaite Curr describing the tough environment of Wanjiwalku lands wrote that the earliest white explorer Charles Sturt almost expired there:-
The country of the Pono forms a portion of the interior traversed by Captain Sturt in 1845 and described in such dismal colours as destined to be for ever uninhabitable by civilized people. It was here that, living in an underground room as a protection against the intense heat, his nails ceased to grow; the hairs of his head split at the end; Lucifer matches dropped, from the hand, light of themselves on reaching the ground, and so on; and yet this country has been found for several years to make good sheep-runs.

Marcello Costa

Marcello Costa (born 9 January 1940) is an Italian-born Australian medical researcher, academic, and public health advocate.
He specializes in the structure and functions of the enteric nervous system. He taught in Turin, Melbourne, and Helsinki before moving to Adelaide in 1975 where he was a foundation lecturer at the Flinders Medical School, building the new discipline of neuroscience at the college.
He has been at Flinders University since, where he is the Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor of Neurophysiology in the Department of Physiology.
He co-founded the Australian Neuroscience Society, the South Australian Neuroscience Institute (SANI) and the Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM). He was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal and the inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award by the Federation of Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies, and in 2020 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia.
Early life and education.
Costa was born in Turin, Italy, on 9 January 1940. In 1949 his family migrated to Argentina, where he attended San Martin high school and then in 1954 entered the public Italian High School "Cristoforo Colombo" of Buenos Aires, finishing the Scientific Lyceum in 1960. In his youth he was intrigued by science, even selling his bicycle so he could buy a microscope to study protozoa in ponds.
He studied as an intern in the University of Turin's Department of Anatomy and Histology, working as a researcher under supervision of Giorgio Gabella. He was involved in a number of extracurricular activities including editor of the university newspaper "l'Ateneo". Although he was enrolled in anatomy, he also incorporated physiology despite resistance from the university to this multidisciplinary approach. He earned his degree in medicine ("Laurea in Medicina e Chirurgia", equivalent to MB BS) from the University of Turin in 1967; his M.D. thesis was "The Adrenergic Innervation of the Alimentary Canal" with "Dignita di Stampa" (worthy of publication).
Medical research career.
Upon graduating in 1967, Costa completed compulsory military service as medical officer, then he began lecturing at the University of Turin. The following year, he became a Medical Registrar and general practitioner in Italy.
In 1970 he and his newlywed wife Daniela migrated from Italy to Australia. Initially he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in zoology under Professor Geoffrey Burnstock at the University of Melbourne (1970–1973). In 1973 he also worked as a research fellow at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and then at the University of Turin.
In 1975 he moved back to Australia, as a lecturer in Human Physiology at Flinders University.
The discipline of neuroscience was new at the time, and he became a foundation lecturer in the field at the Flinders Medical School (now called the College of Medicine and Public Health).
In 1986 Flinders University recognized his service by creating a personal chair in Neurophysiology, and in 2013 he was appointed the Matthew Flinders Distinguished Professor in the College of Medicine and Public Health, and Professor of Neurophysiology.
His research focuses on the nervous system, specifically how it interacts with the gut to control it, and he has authored or co-authored more than 250 works on that subject, 72 review articles and chapters, and written two books. He also made what Flinders University describes as "a range of landmark discoveries about the role of neurons in driving the activity of the gut, and in recognising that a person's neurological system shapes their thoughts, culture, intellectual capacity, emotions and our bodily functions".
Costa's application of a systematic approach to new methods has made the neuronal structure of the enteric nervous system one of the best understood parts of the nervous system in mammals. Observations in this system have also guided understanding the function of neurons in the central nervous system. The studies he conducted into neuronal reflexes that enable intestinal motility and the neurotransmitters that are involved led to the discovery of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.
In 1983, Costa and John Furness organized the first meeting of the global leaders in the new field of enteric Neuroscience, which was held in Adelaide. In 2014 Costa collaborated with younger colleagues to organize a second such symposium in 2014 named "The enteric nervous system: 30 years later".
He was a founder of the Australian Neuroscience Society, and he served as its president in 1994–1995. In 2003 he founded the South Australian Neuroscience Institute (SANI) in association with neuroscience colleagues and the SA Government, representing the three SA Universities; he served as its co-chair from 2003 to 2010.
Community engagement.
In addition to his formal academic roles, Costa has promoted science-based medicine, philosophy of science and educating the general public, especially concerning neuroscience.
He is often called on by media to give expert commentary on a number of topics, including
the evidence against acupuncture,
universities which give credibility to pseudo-scientific topics including chiropractic,
whether the free trade agreement between Australia and China should include "traditional Chinese medicine", proposals to register traditional Chinese medicine, and the "white light" reportedly seen by some dying people.
He also promotes awareness of the connections between science and humanities, especially in a project called "Science Outside the Square" where he teams with Ian Gibbins, Professor of Anatomy at Flinders, playing keyboard while Costa sings and plays the guitar. Their performances aim to combine science, music, and art.
Costa jointly founded the "Friends of Science in Medicine" (FSM) in 2011, and until 2019 he served as its treasurer. The University of Adelaide described FSM as "a public health watch dog group of distinguished lay members, scientists and health professionals who are concerned about honesty in medical claims and the need for evidence-based medicine particularly in the growing alternative therapy industry". He presented at the 2017 World Science Festival. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Panel of the Australian Science Media Centre.
He was a solo speaker at the Adelaide Festival of Ideas in July 2018, speaking on "A neuroscientist's view of homo sapiens and its world".
Personal life.
Costa married Daniela Tuffanelli in 1970. The couple has a son, Andrea.

French ship Merveilleux (1691)

The Merveilleux was a First Rank ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, the second vessel in the two-ship "Foudroyant" Class. 
This ship was ordered in February 1691 to be built - like her sister - at Brest Dockyard, and on 13 May 1691 she was allotted the name "Merveilleux". The designer and builder of both ships was Blaise Pangalo. They were three-decker ships without forecastles. The "Merveilleux" was launched on 11 November 1691 and completed in April 1692.
She was initially armed with 90 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-four 12-pounders on the upper deck, and ten 6-pounders on the quarterdeck. However she was reduced to 80 guns before the end of 1691. 
The new ship took part in the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692, where she was the flagship of "Lieutenant-Général" Charles-François Davy, Marquis d'Amfreville. Following the battle she and her sister "Foudroyant" put into La Hogue on the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula where they were among a dozen French ships of the line attacked and burnt by Anglo-Dutch naval forces on 2 June 1692.
A new ship was immediately ordered to be built at Brest and given the same name; this was launched in November 1692.

Army Military Police Corps (Indonesia)

Puspomad (Indonesian: "Pusat Polisi Militer Angkatan Darat") or Army Military Police Command, which all of its personnel are part of the Military Police Corps (CPM) (Indonesian: "Korps Polisi Militer") is one of the military general technical functions of the Indonesian Army which has the role for administering administrative assistance and as embodiment and guidance through the operation of Military Police functions. Its duties is basically to execute law enforcement towards the military which includes investigation activities and other policing duties within the scope of the army.
The military police of Indonesia perform duties in the area of law enforcement (including investigation of crime) involving members of the military (even in certain cases that may also involve the regular civilian police, especially if the case involves a civilian), installation of security, escort protection of senior military officers and/or important government officials, setting and supervising prisoners of war, controlling custody of military prisoners, managing military traffic control and marking and managing routes and resupply routes for military and civilian purposes. Indonesian Military Policemen are identifiable with their blue berets, in some occasions they also wear white helmet printed PM and dark blue brassard worn on their upper left sleeve also printed PM.
The Indonesian military police is not considered as a Gendarmerie, as it is only responsible solely to enforce discipline and law and order towards members of the armed forces of all ranks.
History.
The Army Military Police as well as other corps within the army, have their own distinctive historical background which includes its customs, traditions, and pioneer which becomes the basic foundation of the corps. The Military Police Corps (CPM) history can not be separated from the history of Indonesia's struggle of independence and victory. The birth of the Military Police Corps stems from the ideas of some TKR figures who have legal knowledge in Law and discipline background, and they formed the Military police corps as a function to keep law and order within the TKR.
The forerunner to the formation of the Military police.
When the "Tentara Keamanan Rakyat" (People's Security Armed Forces) or TKR was formed on 5 October 1945, there was no legal or regulatory instrument that controlled an armed organization or an army. In addition, the members of the TKR then were also consisting of a variety of people originating from different backgrounds which did not, at that time, understand the nature of military law and discipline, save for only a few who served in the different sides during the Second World War (either as personnel of the Japanese Kempetai or anti-Japanese personnel who worked for the Dutch Royal Marechaussee before the war).
Besides that, during that time there were also some formed organizations consisting of Militias of armed fighters who were not bound to the Central Command. Therefore, the arrangement of armed groups became difficult, especially at that time it was during under the power of the Dutch who preceded the British to re-occupy Indonesia. In such situations that arises, the idea of some TKR members to establish a body that regulates discipline among armed organizations were beginning to arise, in which the idea was founded by people of law enforcement background. So following the idea, some regions autonomously began forming Army Police forces such as in Aceh, which was based in Kutaraja consisting of 2 companies of troops, as well as in North Sumatera also began establishing the "East Sumatera Army Police" and in Bengkulu also began forming units of Army Police of the TKR Bengkulu regiment.
While on the island of Java on September 26, 1945, an Army Police Battalion of the West Java division was formed, which in addition besides serving as policing duties in the Division, the battalion also performed combat duties in accordance with the conditions of the struggle at that time. Due to the urgent precariousness, the Supreme Headquarters of TKR deems it necessary to establish a provisional regulation in the field of Military Policing. For that purpose, on 8 December 1945, the Supreme Headquarters of TKR gave guidance, so that each Division has to form a Military Police unit, which is in charge of investigating and prosecuting cases within and of the Army, including division and regiments in Java and Sumatera. At the end of December 1945, the TKR Supreme Headquarters Task Force determined the formation of the Army Police Headquarters (MTPT) commanded by Colonel Prabu Sunarjo. Under the General Command of General Soedirman the MTPT was a major support command whose Provost Marshal reported to the Commander of the Armed Forces.
In 1946 at Kopeng, Wonosobo, a joint meeting between the leaders of the People's General Public Investigators ("Penyelidik Masyarakat Umum") and the Military Police Corps was held. The joint meeting succeeded in formulating the main tasks and organization of the Military Police as well as by acclamation to choose Major General Santoso, Commander of PT Kediri, as the first Commander of the Military Police, with his deputy being Colonel Prabu Sunarjo. Following this, then on 22 June 1946 held in the square of Yogyakarta, the President of Indonesia, Sukarno as the Supreme Commander of the armed forces inaugurated the Military Police with the honorific name of the legendarily and historic "Gajah Mada Division", named after Gajah Mada, who is the patron of the MP Corps.
The Gajah Mada Division was organized into the following:
Each MP Regiment was composed of one to four MP battalions and each battalion was subdivided into companies and platoons with an assignment area that generally resembles the administrative division of government. Besides the regiments it was also formed the "Military Police Mobile Battalion". After the Gajah Mada Division's formation was completed a Military Police Headquarters (MBPT) was formed immediately, which set policies on the tasks and responsibilities of the Military police as a whole.
The MP Corps of the Army was reorganized with effect on 20 March 1948, when the Gajah Mada Division was split into the 1st and 2nd Java MP Corps, each organized into a corps regimental HQ and 3 battalions. An additional corps was raised for Sumatera, with 5 battalions each.
Organizational dynamics.
The Decree of the Armed Forces Commander Number: Kep / A / 7 / III / 1971, dated 6 March 1971 established the Military Police organization and changed the Army's organizational structure. Furthermore, through the Decree of the Chief of Staff of the Army No. Kep / 45 / II / 1972 dated 5 February 1972, the Army Provost Service was formed on the basis of the MP Corps.
Subsequently, followed by the Decree of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces No. Kep / 04 / P / II / 1984 dated 4 February 1984 on the Execution of Military Police functions within ABRI and the Chief of Staff of the Army's decree No. Kep / 11 / XII / 1984 dated 17 December 1984 regarding the revocation of the Provost organization to become the Military Police Command ("Pusat Polisi Militer" abbreviated "Puspom"), which at that time has authority in the performance of its duties and functions towards the three services of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air force) known as "Bina Tunggal".
During the reformation era (1998), after the separation of the police from the Armed forces organization (ABRI), based on the Decision of the TNI Commander Number: Kep / 1 / III / 2004 dated 26 March 2004, the Execution of Duties and Functions of Military policing within the TNI is carried out by the: 
with authority and command of operational control from the Panglima of the TNI, in its execution delegated to the Chief of Staff of each services respectively. The three Military police services (POMAD, POMAL, and POMAU) and their respective provost generals report under the Armed Forces Joint Service Military Police Command ("Pusat Polisi Militer TNI" abbreviated Puspom TNI) which is commanded by a Major general.
At the TNI Headquarters level, as the main aide and advisor to the TNI Commander (Panglima TNI) concerning in the field of Military Policing affairs is held by a Major general holding the appointment of Provost Marshal of the Armed Forces Military Police (Danpuspom), until 2015 the post of Assistant to the Commander for Military Police Affairs/Provost Commandant (Passuspom) was held by the Provost Marshal of Military Police (Danpuspomad) as a concurrent appointment until a separate appointment was made as part of the ongoing reorganization of the services.
One of the more famous military policemen was Lieutenant General Siswondo Parman, a victim of the 30 September Movement of 1965, who served as Provost Commandant from 1950 - 1952.

Historical books

The historical books are a division of Christian Bibles, grouping 12 (or in some denominations more) books of the Old Testament. It includes the Former Prophets from the Nevi'im and two of the ungrouped books of Ketuvim of the Hebrew Bible together with the Book of Ruth and the Book of Esther which in the Hebrew are both found in the Five Megillot. These 12 books make up the historical books in the Protestant Bible, but several other books not found in the Hebrew Bible are also included in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles (see the list below for details).
The books provide a history of the Israelites spanning nearly a millennium, from their conquest of Canaan until the return to Zion in 539 BCE. The historical books tell of the entry of the Israelites into the Promised Land after The Exodus, the leadership of the biblical judges, the establishment of the United Monarchy and its subsequent division into the northern Kingdom of Israel and southern Kingdom of Judah, and the Babylonian captivity.

Pay Up (horse)

Pay Up (1933 – 16 July 1960) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. As a two-year-old in 1935 he showed promise as he won one race and was place in his other three starts. In the following spring he won the Free Handicap and then recorded his biggest success in the 2000 Guineas. He started favourite for Epsom Derby but finished fourth, sustaining leg injuries which ended his track career. He had little success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Pay Up was a "stylish" brown horse bred and owned by Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. He was trained throughout his racing career by Joseph Lawson at Manton, Wiltshire.
Pay Up was sired by Fairway, an outstanding racehorse who won the St Leger, the Eclipse Stakes and two runnings of the Champion Stakes. At stud his other winners included Blue Peter, Watling Street, Garden Path, Tide-way and Fair Trial. Pay Up's dam Book Debt was a daughter of Popingaol, who won two minor races but became a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Book Law, Pogrom, Splendid Jay (Yorkshire Oaks) and Fair Cop (female-line ancestor of Provoke).
Racing career.
1935: two-year-old season.
Pay Up began his racing career by finishing third behind Yesta and Doublure in the Sorrel Plate over five furlongs at Hurst Park. On the last day of the July meeting at Newmarket Racecourse, he ran second to Lord Derby's filly Tide-Way (later to win the 1000 Guineas) in the Fulbourne Stakes. The colt went on to finish second to Thrustaway in the Kingston Plate at Sandown Park before recording his first success on his final start of the season when he won the Autumn Breeders' Foal Stakes at Manchester Racecourse from Silver Crest.
1936: three-year-old season.
Pay Up made a successful first appearance as a three-year-old when he won the Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket in mid-April. On 29 April the colt, ridden by Robert "Bobby" Dick, started at odds of 11/2 in a nineteen-runner field for the 128th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course. The other fancied contenders included Abjer (Middle Park Stakes), Bala Hissar (Dewhurst Stakes), Monument (Craven Stakes), Rhodes Scholar and Mahmoud. After taking the lead Pay Up was headed by Mahmoud, but rallied strongly in the final strides to win by a short head in a "thrilling" finish, with three lengths back to Thankerton in third. The colt's victory was described as "immensely popular" with the Newmarket crowd.
Pay Up's win in the Guineas elevated him to the top of the betting for the Epsom Derby, a race in which Lord Astor's horses had finished second on five occasions. On 27 May Pay Up started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles on hard ground but after tracking the leaders for most of the way he finished fourth behind Mahmoud, Taj Akbar and Thankerton. After the race Pay Up was badly lame and his retirement from racing was announced two months later.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pay Up an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Pay Up began his stud career in 1937 at an initial fee of 250 guineas. He had little success as a sired of winners on the flat but did better with his National Hunt horses. The most notable of his offspring was the mare Nickel Coin who won the Grand National in 1951. Pay Up was euthanised on 16 July 1960.

List of IIHF World Rankings

This is a list of IIHF World Rankings from its inception in 2003. The IIHF World Ranking is a ranking of the performance of the national ice hockey teams of member countries of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments.
The system was approved at the IIHF congress of September 2003. According to IIHF President René Fasel, the system was designed to be simple to understand and "reflect the long-term quality of all national hockey programs and their commitment to international hockey".
Men's.
Seven nations have achieved a top ten ranking every time (including Olympic rankings) between 2003–2021, they are (in order of average ranking): Canada, Sweden, Russia, Finland, Czech Republic, the United States, and Switzerland. An additional five nations, Slovakia (twenty-two times), Germany (sixteen times), Latvia (fourteen times), Belarus (nine times), and Norway (eight times) have been in the top ten at least once.
As of 2021, three countries have accomplished a first-place ranking: Canada thirteen times, Sweden six times, and Russia four times. Czechia and Canada are the only nations to have achieved a top-six ranking every time, and Canada the only nation to achieve a top-five ranking every time.
Women's.
Only six nations have achieved a top ten ranking every time between 2003–2019. These nations are (in order of average ranking): Canada, the United States, Finland, Sweden, Russia, and Switzerland. An additional ten nations, Germany (eighteen times), Japan (seventeen times), Kazakhstan (ten times), China (nine times), Czech Republic (nine times), Slovakia (five times), Norway (twice), Denmark (twice), Austria (twice), and France (twice) have been in the top ten at least once. 
As of 2019, only two countries have accomplished a first-place ranking: Canada eleven times and the United States eight times. Canada, Finland and the United States are the only nations to have achieved a top-five ranking every time, with Canada and the United States never falling below a top-two ranking.
In December 2017, six Russian women hockey players were found to have committed doping violations at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The IOC disqualified the Russian team from the 2014 hockey tournament and the IIHF was requested to modify the results accordingly. The information in this historical section does not reflect any changes that the IIHF may make in the record.

<doc id="56721315" url="?curid=56721315" title="Biodiversity hypothesis of health">
Biodiversity hypothesis of health

According to the biodiversity hypothesis, reduced contact of people with natural environment and biodiversity may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. The hypothesis is based on the observation that two dominant socio-ecological trends – the loss of biodiversity and increasing incidence of inflammatory diseases – are interconnected.
Urbanization and fragmentation of habitats increasingly lead to loss of connection between human and natural environment. Furthermore, immunological non-communicable diseases have become increasingly common in recent decades especially in urbanized communities.
The microbes of natural environment influence human health.
Many immunological inflammatory diseases, such as allergies, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases, have become increasingly common in countries of high standard of living and high level of hygiene. One reason is presumably that along with degradation and fragmentation of habitats and urbanization, people encounter less microbes of natural environment. Here, microbes of natural environment are referred as all microbes, especially those which are not pathogens nor parasites (parasites still have essential role in regulation of immune response).
According to the core message of the biodiversity hypothesis, it is essential to the development of our immune system that we are sufficiently exposed to diverse natural environments and especially to the microbes in them. The microbes in our surroundings influence our own microbiota which is further connected to our immune system. Furthermore, immunological disorders are the main cause of inflammatory diseases. In a sense, microbes train developing immune system to identify actual threats from harmless allergens, but there is not yet full consensus of the mechanism. During biological evolution, we have in a way outsourced many of the functions of our body to our microbiota. Microbiota trains immune system throughout the life: organs constantly process invasive particles and proteins. Functional immune system discriminates threatening particles from the harmless ones and products of one's own cells from foreign ones. Present populations of cities evidently have marks of chronic inflammation as a result of weakening immune defence.
Prevention of inflammatory diseases and maintenance of health.
Mild inflammation and immunological imbalance are characteristic to a group of chronic non-communicable diseases and disorders that threaten public health. These include asthma, allergies, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurological diseases and mental disorders. Prevention of many of these diseases have been improved by affecting known risk factors, but they explain only a fraction of chronic diseases and have not revealed the bottom reasons of increasing incidence of allergies.
When health benefits that are based on diverse nature are taken seriously, cost savings may be major. For example, in Finland in year 2011, total costs of asthma and allergies for the society were 1,3—1,6 billion euros. The direct costs of allergic diseases, including disability to work, have decreased by 15% in the 2000s as a result of shift in Finnish national allergy programme. In the programme, the focus was shifted from curing the symptoms to prevention, for example by emphasizing connection to natural environment.
Exposure to microbes.
We are exposed to microbes via different ways from which the most important are respiratory tract, digestive system and skin contact. The habitat we live in and the food we eat influence greatly to our microbiota. Our own way of living and our choices — how we live, eat, move and what are our recreational activities — impacts on the amount of valuable microbe exposure. The amount as well as the microbial diversity of exposure are essential factors.
For example, youth living in Northern Karelia (Finns) and those living in Russian Karelia (Russians) have significantly different skin and nose microbiotas. At the same time, the differences in inflammatory diseases are significant: only one third of Russian youth have allergies compared to Finnish youth. Similar differences in the incidence of allergies have been observed between Finnish children living in differing, urban or rural environments.
Risks.
Traditionally, natural environment have been seen from the viewpoint of management of the threats it causes. The incidence of several infectious diseases have indeed decreased because of improved level of hygiene. Formerly, recommended treatment to allergies was to avoid exposure as now it is known that exposure is essential to develop immune system. While increasing healthy exposure to microbes it is essential for achieving the benefits to acknowledge and reduce the risk of being exposed to [pathogens].
Microbial exposure of future mothers and children.
A baby is exposed to mother's microbes during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. The nutrition and way of life of expecting mother as well as chosen ways of giving birth and feeding have remarkable effect on the development of the baby's immune system. Even small choices can have major impact on individual health. Vaginal birth and breastfeeding are influential ways to increase the exposure of baby to mother's microbes and therefore further the development of immune system.
Immune system continues to develop throughout childhood and therefore regular microbial exposure is essential for children. Lack of forests and fields near home is connected to unbalanced skin microbiota of children and youth. Kindergartens and schools are functional places to increase microbial exposure as they encompass whole age groups at its best. From public health point of view, it would be functional to focus on sufficient microbial exposure in kindergartens and schools, in which case the exposure does not rely on families' way of life.
Anyhow, microbiotas of human body change throughout life and therefore all age groups benefit from being exposed to the microbes of natural environment. One's own way of life and choices related to housing, nutrition and movement are in an essential role in that exposure. Immune system can be strengthened throughout life with increased and diverse contact with nature. Immune system function weakens with age and therefore regular contact to natural environment is important to elders too.
Urban planning.
Urbanisation is a global trend. While urban structure is condensing, it is important to conserve urban nature. From a viewpoint of biodiversity hypothesis, urban planning should take into account both holistic health and wellbeing benefits of nature and possibilities of citizens to be exposed to biodiverse natural environments and microbes. Functionally, exposure takes place near home and daily routes. In city center there is usually less forests than outskirts, but parks and different built natural elements can be exploited also in highly constructed areas.
In terms of nature contact of children and the elderly, the quality of the near environment is particularly important, as the mobility circle is more limited than the working age population. Functional natural elements in yards of kindergartens, schools, sheltered homes and retirement homes could be e.g. cultivation boxes, fruit trees, berry bushes, green roofs and walls and gardens. Forests and parks must be located close for being easy to use in everyday life, during lessons and walks. Deadwood can be left to forests and parks to promote biodiversity and inspire movement. Self-sufficient mobility of the elderly is supported by sufficient density of benches. Planning of healthy habitats requires cooperation between sectors — at least zoning, recreation and exercise, management of green and blue infrastructure, construction, environment, health care, and education.
Needs for further understanding.
It is not yet clear, what amount of exposure is needed, how the microbes of environment precisely get in system and what are relations between different microbes. Is visiting natural environments occasionally enough or should we be exposed to the microbes of natural environment in our everyday life?
Anyhow, it is evident that we get multiple health and wellbeing benefits from nature. Despite there remains several open questions related to the biodiversity hypothesis, it has been proposed that we should still take it into account in urban and regional planning and build healthy and biodiverse cities.

Unspent transaction output

In cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, an unspent transaction output (UTXO) is an abstraction of electronic money. Each UTXO is analogous to a coin, and holds a certain amount of value in its respective currency. Each UTXO represents a chain of ownership implemented as a chain of digital signatures where the owner signs a message (transaction) transferring ownership of their UTXO to the receiver's public key.
A UTXO defines an output of a blockchain transaction that has not been spent, i.e. can be used as an input in a new transaction. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency that uses the UTXO model.
UTXO model.
The UTXO model is a design common to many cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies which use the UTXO model do not use accounts or balances. Instead, individual coins (UTXOs) are transferred between users much like physical coins or cash.
UTXO set.
The total UTXOs present in a blockchain represents a set, every transaction consumes elements from this set and creates new ones that are added to the set. Thus, the set represents all of the coins in a particular cryptocurrency system. The complete UTXO set can be summed to calculate the total supply of a cryptocurrency at a given point in time. 
Outputs are a superset of UTXOs. Accordingly, UTXOs are a subset of the outputs superset. Bitcoin UTXO lifespans have been studied.
In the case of a valid blockchain transaction, unspent outputs (and only unspent outputs) may be used to fund further transactions. The requirement that only unspent outputs may be used in further transactions is necessary to prevent double-spending and fraud.
For this reason, inputs on a blockchain are removed from the UTXO set when a transaction occurs, whilst at the same time, outputs create new UTXOs, which are added to the UTXO set. These unspent transaction outputs may be used (by the holders of private keys; for example, persons with cryptocurrency wallets) for the purpose of future transactions.
Origins.
The UTXO model can be attributed to Hal Finney's "Reusable Proofs of Work" proposal, which itself is based on Adam Back's 1997 Hashcash proposal.

MicroMasters

MicroMasters programs are a series of online graduate level courses offered by universities through edX that one can take to develop standalone skills for career advancement or earn graduate level credentials from its respective universities, equivalent to a semester of a full master's degree. It was designed to be a bridge between a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, allowing employees to continue advancing their education without affecting their employment and personal commitments.
First launched in September 2016 with 19 MicroMasters programs from 14 different universities as an extension of its MOOC programs, edX eventually expanded to include 17 additional programs in February 2017. As of February 2019, 52 different MicroMasters programs are offered, with 48 in English, 3 in Spanish, and 1 in French. Each MicroMasters program is sponsored by at least one industry partner, including GE, Microsoft, IBM, Hootsuite, Fidelity, Bloomberg, Walmart, PWC, Booz-Allen Hamilton, and Ford, as well as supported by various universities by allowing graduates to use the MicroMasters as advanced standing for its respective graduate program.
These programs are designed to bridge the gap between job candidates with a bachelor's degree and companies that want employees with an advanced degree by offering credentials that are equivalent to 25 to 50 percent of a master's degree or 20 to 30 ECTS in Europe.
Unlike other existing microcredentials, the MicroMasters programs offer both the benefit of gaining relevant skills in a particular field that can support career development and a pathway to advanced credits in the respective universities offering the course. The idea of the MicroMasters program started out as an iteration of the existing MOOC model when Coursera first started offering specializations for its various disciplines and a response to the changing nature of work as well as the major skills shortage currently impacting businesses around the world.
Further advancement in the MicroMasters program has resulted greater partnership with top-rated universities offering full residential, online, and blended graduate programs at a much lower price in the range of $10,000 to $23,000 starting from October 2018.
Background.
History.
The development of the MicroMasters was originally conceived at MIT by Sanjay Sarma, with Erdin Beshimov becoming the Founding Director of the program. In its early stage MIT offered the MicroMasters as a pilot within its supply chain management program, consulting industry leaders. edX subsequently applied for a trademark for "MicroMasters" in response to Udacity registering "nanodegree" as its trademark in 2014. The first 19 MicroMasters programs were subsequently launched in September 2016, in collaboration with 14 different universities. This also included Rochester Institute of Technology's MicroMasters in project management, allowing learners to use it to fulfil the prerequisite of project management education for the PMP certification.
In 2017, General Electric promised to interview any Massachusetts resident who completed a MicroMasters program in supply chain management, cybersecurity, cloud computing, or artificial intelligence.
In 2018, MIT admitted its first batch of 40 students into its blended supply chain management program from graduates of its MicroMasters program, reducing its usual 10-month program to 5 months. This pilot also saw 200,000 people signing up, 19,000 earning certificates and 800 sitting for the final proctored examination. It was reported in July 2018 that the students who were admitted into the blended program had better than average scores across the board than those who were in the residential program.
Funding.
In October 2016, the Lumina Foundation granted $900,000 to edX to create 30 more MicroMasters certificate programs.
Program structure.
Prerequisites.
All MicroMasters programs are currently running on the edX MOOC platform, where learners are free to audit any of the courses and pay later should they choose to do so. Depending on the program, there are prerequisites ranging from graduate level understanding of various specific disciplines or work experienced. However, these prerequisites serve as recommended guidelines for the learners rather than a strictly enforced rule so there are no specific degree requirements for any of the courses. However, learners will have to pay if they wish to pursue a verified certificate.
Certification.
To qualify for a certificate for successfully completing a MicroMasters program, all learners are required to complete a series of interactive courses as specified in the respective MicroMasters program and achieve a minimum grade according to the institution awarding the certification.
For learners interested in developing skills for professional advancement, the certificate for completing a MicroMasters program may be sufficient.
Continuing education.
For learners interested in academic credit, the learner must be admitted into the university's respective master's program. Some programs, such as the MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management by MIT also operate on a blended learning model which include a timed examination as well as a final proctored examination. Admission requirements for its on-campus blended learning program differ from its traditional residential admission requirements as applicants are not required to submit scores in a GRE or GMAT as performance in the Micromasters program will be taken as a substitute for it. Some other programs still follow usual admission guidelines and the MicroMasters program has little to no impact on their application apart from receiving advanced credits upon admission into its respective programs. Generally, most courses include practice exercises which are ungraded as well as graded assignments with limited attempts.
The following is a list of the current MicroMasters programs offered as well as the respective graduate degree options available for each program upon graduation of the MicroMasters program.
Demographics.
According to a report by Columbia University's Teachers College, a typical MicroMasters student is well-educated and employed, with almost 80% having an undergraduate degree or better. The majority of the learners are between the age of 22 and 44, with the United States and India forming 16% and 14% of the learners, followed by Brazil, Colombia, and Nigeria forming the next 3%. The majority of learners have also indicated in being fluent or proficient in English.

Giorgio Behr

Giorgio Behr (born 18 September 1948 in Schaffhausen) is a Swiss businessman, lawyer, accountant and university professor.
Behr is the founder and former chairman of the Behr Bircher Cellpack BBC as well as president of the Swiss handball club Kadetten Schaffhausen. Until the end of 2015, he was also CEO of the Behr Bircher Cellpack BBC, a position which he held for more than 12 years. Between 1990 and 2005 he was also Professor of Business Administration at the University of St. Gallen. Since resigning there in 2005, he has been Honorary Professor and President of the Institute for Accounting, Controlling and Auditing (ACA). In addition, he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Saurer AG, first as Vice President from 1995, then as President from 2003 to 2006. From 2008 to 2017, he was Chairman of the Supervisory Board of ZF Friedrichshafen, one of the largest automotive suppliers worldwide.
Life.
Behr studied law at the University of Zurich, where he graduated in 1971 and received his doctorate in 1974. This was followed in 1976 by the lawyer patent, 1979 by a diploma as a Chartered Accountant and a research stay at the University of Washington in Seattle.
Behr began his professional career in 1971 as a commercial school teacher in Zurich and Schaffhausen, starting in 1972, he worked at the auditing firm Fides (now part of KPMG), for which he worked from home and abroad until 1982 and specialized in renovating and restructuring companies. From 1982 to 1984, he worked for the industrial group Hesta (Zellweger-Luwa and Schiesser). In 1984, he founded his own consulting firm, BDS Consulting, and became self-employed. Parallel to his professional career, Behr began his academic career in 1989 and initially became a lecturer at the University of St. Gallen and from 1990, a professor of business administration with a main focus on accounting.
In 1991, his career took a turn from a reorganizer to becoming a real entrepreneur. At that time, Behr was commissioned to renovate the Bercher-based apparatus builder Bircher. When no buyer could be found for Bircher, Behr took over the enterprise threatened by bankruptcy, together with Anton Bucher Bechtler and the management. In 1993, Giorgio Behr belonged to the founding team of Bank am Bellevue.
After Behr took over a majority stake in the 1935 founded and based in Villmergen Cellpack Group in 2001, he then incorporated the Bircher Group together with the Cellpack Group in the newly formed group Behr Bircher Cellpack BBC in 2003. In addition, he served as a director and then as chairman of the board of directors of the Saurer Group (1994 to 2006). Since 1992, he has been a member of the board of the Liechtenstein Hilti Group and since 2008, chairman of the supervisory board of the German automotive supplier ZF Friedrichshafen.
Giorgio Behr represented Switzerland in the accounting bodies of the UN (ISAR) and the OECD (CIME where he was elected vice president and was spokesman of the OECD representative in the ISAR / UN), in the WP1 of the IOSCO and the Swiss Exchange in the EFRAG. He was, from the founding (in 1984) of the Standard Setter, for accounting in Switzerland, Swiss GAAP FER, Committee of the Commission and also President of the Commission of the FER (1992-2005). Since 2005, he has been president of the Board of FER. He was also President of the Financial Reporting Working Group of SWX Swiss Exchange (2002-2005). On behalf of the Federal Council, he was a member of the Commission Mengiardi 1998 for the revision of accounting and auditing law. In 2007, he was President of a small group of experts, where he was commissioned to draw up the draft of the new revision law (in force since 2007). Subsequently, he was (with the collaboration of Max Sterchi) an expert of the Federal Council for the drafting of the new Swiss accounting law (in force since 1 January 2013). From 1998 to 2001 he was a member of the board of Trustees of the professional association of accountants and tax experts in Switzerland. From 2001 to 2003, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Trustee Chamber and, from 2003 to 2007, first Vice President and then President, of the Trustee Chamber (then limited to 2-year term).
In 2008, Giorgio Behr attracted attention, in particular through takeover attempts by listed companies, and in the process received fierce rejection responses from the respective companies. While he succeeded in the acquisition of Groupe Baumgartner Holding, he failed in his takeover attempts of Sia Abrasives. The shareholders and the management of Sia Abrasives, fought the planned commitment of the Swiss entrepreneur Giorgio Behr and preferred instead, a takeover by the German, Robert Bosch GmbH. In November 2015, it was announced that the new owner planned a larger job cut for the Swiss site of Sia Abrasives. This was against the commitments made in 2008, according to which the Switzerland location should not be relocated. Such a measure was pointed out by Giorgio Behr in the takeover battle for the company as a risk of a foreign solution. Contrary to this, the preservation of the location in Switzerland has always been formulated as a key strategic goal for Swiss entrepreneur Giorgio Behr, as Behr, with its Swiss-based Behr Bircher Cellpack BBC Group, has more synergy potential in Switzerland than the new owner in this case. In November 2008, Behr acquired, via its BDS investment company AG, a stake of 6.36 percent in the Swiss industrial group Georg Fischer, making it the largest single shareholder of the company.
In November 2009, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), announced that it had opened an administrative case against Giorgio Behr and others on suspicion of possible violations of reporting obligations in connection with a substantial shareholding in Sia Abrasives. On 16 March 2011, the Financial Market Authority filed a criminal complaint against Behr with the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) for breach of disclosure requirements. On 24 May 2011, the legal service of the FDF ceased proceedings after Behr made a reparation payment of one million francs. According to the business magazine Bilanz, the outcome of the procedure makes it clear that no deliberate violation could be proven and that it was at most a matter of negligence.
When, in 2005, the free newspaper Schaffhauser Bock got into financial difficulties and the jobs were endangered, Giorgio Behr took over the publishing rights and enabled the entrepreneur René Steiner an orderly execution of its activities as well as the rescue of the jobs. Today, the Schaffhauser Bock, in which the publisher Meier + Cie AG (publisher of the only daily newspaper in the region, the Schaffhauser Nachrichten) holds a minority stake, is again successful and was able to increase the number of readers from 38,000 (WEMF) to around 53,000.
Giorgio Behr is married and father of four sons, some of which are already successful in businesses. Pascal Behr with his partner Michael Gabi and the company Cytosurge; which in 2012, received the ZKB Pioneer Award Technopark from the Technopark Zürich and the Zürcher Kantonalbank for a technical project. His assets were estimated in 2012 by the Swiss business magazine Balance to 450 million Swiss francs.

Giorgio Behr is co-founder President of the charitable foundation Museum Railway Stein am Rhein / Etzwilen – Singen. With his noteworthy contribution, he has made the repair of, amongst others, the Ramsen station, the section in the area of Singen possible and the purchase of various vehicles. The SEHR &amp; RS operates the SBB's only steam railway line, which runs from Stein am Rhein via the Rhein Hemishofen bridge over the Rhine and the state border to Singen. On 28 May 2011, for the first time since 1969 a passenger train across the border to Germany ran there. Thousands (in total there were about 10.000 visitors on the opening day) welcomed the first passenger train since 1969 - as in the founding of 1875.
As co-founder and main sponsor of the non-profit foundation National Handball Training &amp; Performance Center NHTLZ Schweizersbild, Behr is also involved in indoor sports promotion in the greater Schaffhausen region. On 9 September 2011 the largest handball training center in Switzerland opened, in the BBC-Arena, a well-respected Europe-wide complex with four training halls and three game halls, a campus and an affiliated hotel operation. The Suisse Handball Academy SHA, set up by Giorgio Behr and led by Michael Suter, also enables young talent to combine sport and training. Behr is President of the Foundation Council of the non-profit foundation NHTLZ.
Giorgio Behr was himself with Gelbschwarz Schaffhausen at the beginning of the 1970s, under coach Eugen Wüger, player in the NLA (National League A) and NLB (today together Swiss Handball League SHL). After returning to his home club Kadetten Schaffhausen, he led the team as player-coach and trainer to the NLB (National League B) and founded a successful youth department (under President and Kadetten honorary member Kurt Baader). After a professional and family-related break, he took over the handball department as president in 1992, with a small team of former players, teammates and other Kadetten officials. Since then, the Kadetten have been playing at the top of the NLA in Swiss handball. In 1993, for the first time, they achieved qualification for participation in the European Cup in 1999, with the winning of the Cup victory it became the first national title the won. The Kadetten won the Masters championship title for the first time in 2005, to which five more followed until 2012.

Pari (2018 Indian film)

Pari () is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language supernatural horror film directed by Prosit Roy in his debut. It stars Anushka Sharma and marks her 3rd production venture for her company Clean Slate Filmz. Parambrata Chatterjee, Ritabhari Chakraborty, Rajat Kapoor and Mansi Multani feature in supporting roles. Production on the film began in June 2017 and it released theatrically on 2 March 2018.
Plot.
The story revolves around the demon Ifrit and Auladhchakra,a satanic cult in Bangladesh aiming to progress the bloodline of Ifrit. They torture innocent women and summon the demon to rape them so that they are impregnated with its offspring. Professor Qasim Ali used to head a group of vigilantes that sought out women impregnated by Ifrit, kept them captive until they gave birth, then immediately killed the demonic babies by cutting off their heads and sealing them within glass jars. This drew opposition from the villagers despite the support and the group was shut down due to their violently radical approach. Rukhsana (Anushka Sharma )is the daughter of one such woman, who was a victim of the satanic ritual but escaped her captivity before Professor Ali could kill her child .
Arnab is a young man who runs a printing press. Piyali, a nurse, is set for an arranged marriage with him. On the way home in the heavy rain, he and his father accidentally hit an old woman. The woman dies and when police search her home, an old hut in the forest, they find a dirty Rukhsana chained inside. Arnab, feeling sympathetic and responsible upon realizing she has no one, takes her in. Rukhsana knows nothing of the modern outside world and often sees demonic visions that terrorize her. Arnab finds her strange but endearing. As the two spend time together, she falls in love with him. A mortuary assistant discovers that Rukhsana's mother has the cult's mark on her skin and informs Professor Ali, who has been searching for Rukhsana for years.
One night, Rukhsana gets sick. Though Arnab mistakes it for her period, the truth is that every month, her body needs to spew out the poison it produces due to her demon blood. She secretly kills a dog by biting it and releasing her poison. She later admits she loves Arnab and the two make love. The next morning, Professor Ali confronts Arnab with the truth about her but he refuses to believe him. The morgue assistant fights Arnab, injuring him. Rukhsana kills the assistant in retaliation and gets between Arnab and Piyali, feeling jealous. When Arnab argues with her, she grabs him by the throat and lifts him clear off the ground.
Disturbed, Arnab realizes Professor Ali was right and researches Ifrit. He learns that Ifrit babies are born in one month instead of nine, and without an umbilical cord. Arnab contacts Professor Ali. Just as he arrives with his men, Rukhsana reveals to Arnab that she is pregnant. The professor's men tie her up and torture her so that she dies of her own poison. Though she cries for Arnab, he leaves, depressed. After three weeks, Piyali visits Arnab at his parent's house and he tells her the truth about Rukhsana. His conversation with her makes him realize he shouldn't have left her to die.
Rukhsana, after being beaten repeatedly, breaks free and kills the professor before heading over to Piyali's. She injures Piyali, but goes into labor. Piyali is unable to kill her, being a nurse and with her own past of having an abortion. Instead, she helps Rukhsana deliver the baby, which has an umbilical cord. Rukhsana leaves the baby to her and disappears. Arnab rushes to the old hut, where he finds her near death. He cries and hugs her. She resists the urge to bite him and release her poison, instead letting it remain in her body. Before dying, she tells Arnab that the baby is human. At the end, Arnab says that Rukhsana's love made the baby human, rather than Ifrit's hatred.
Marketing.
The first look of "Pari" was released on 13 June 2017 by Sharma via her Twitter handle. The film's motion poster, promotionally called "Screamer", was released on 9 January 2018, showing the face of Sharma's character getting bruised. A 30-second clip, the second "screamer", was released on 3 February 2018, which showed Sharma watching a cartoon on television with an idyllic smile, giving the impression that she is safe and okay. However, the camera pans to show that her hands and feet are bruised, and she is chained to the bed. The official teaser of "Pari" was released on 7 February 2018 by Sharma via her Twitter handle. The third "screamer", released on Valentine's Day, opens with Anushka and Parambrata's characters watching television when Anushka says "I love you" to him. She becomes disturbed when she hears an eerie female voice respond, "I love you too." The camera pans to show a bloody and battered version of herself, grinning and terrifying the real Anushka. The official trailer of Pari was released one day later, on 15 February 2018. After the trailer, two other "screamers" have been released.
Controversies.
During the shooting of the film in August 2017 at Basanti State Highway, 24 Pgs. (S) district of West Bengal, a technician was electrocuted. The shooting of the film was immediately stopped but was started again after a while.
The film has been banned in Pakistan for allegedly promoting black magic, some non-Islamic values and anti-Muslim sentiments.
Music.
The music of "Pari" was composed by Anupam Roy while the lyrics were written by Anvita Dutt.
Reception.
Critical response.
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 42% based on 6 reviews with an average rating of 5 out of 10.
Positive reviews gave a definite praise for Anushka's performance and praised the makers for doing a movie on this genre.
While Renuka Vyavahare of TOI called it “Anushka’s strongest work as an actor-producer so far”, she also went on to add that, “Pari has the ability to redefine the genre as it’s refreshingly different, atmospheric and moody”.
Rajeev Masand of News18 gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, "Pari, co-produced by and starring Anushka Sharma, is a competently made film that’s rich in atmospherics.”, but he went onto conclude that “Pari doesn’t come together in a coherent, satisfying way. What starts out interestingly, ends in a mess."
Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle stated: “Pari is a delightful treat to those who are fond of horror flicks. And stop complaining that Bollywood doesn't produce good horror films!”
Koimoi reviewed Pari as “one of the best to come out of this genre”. As a last word they added: “Hollywood, please take out the notepad and write down the stuff from Pari on how to make a non-clichéd horror film. Surely one of the best in this genre &amp; a must watch for the fans. Producer Anushka Sharma needs a special mention to make this possible” and rated the film 3.5 out of 5. "Gulf news" gave the movie 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that “Anushka Sharma’s horror film is a world apart from other ghoulish Bollywood offerings, and that’s a good thing”.
Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "Anushka Sharma's film Pari is a confusing tale of ghosts, ghouls, djinns and forced legitimacy. Pari appears puzzled as if they don't know how to end what they started. With 136-minute screen time, Pari doesn't head anywhere." Lakshana N Palat of India Today gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 saying that, "The story of Pari is submerged under irrelevant scenes, jump scares, and the desperate need to fall into the horror-film category. It's a shame, because the storyline was actually quite a unique and interesting one." Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and concluded her review by saying that, "Anushka Sharma plays Rukhsana with a great deal of bloody enthusiasm. You cannot accuse her of not trying hard, but the film is so poorly-written, and so scatter-brained that nothing can rescue it." Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV said about the film that, "It lacks the narrative consistency that its in-your-face methods needed in order to be truly effective. In the end, the makers of Pari try way too hard. The outcome is an extended blur that leaves you dazed but totally unimpressed." and gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5.

Obadiah Elliott

Obadiah Elliott (1763 – 13 January 1838) was a British inventor from Tonbridge, Kent who patented in 1804 the method of mounting coach bodies on elliptical springs attached directly to the axles, replacing the traditional heavy perch.
The elliptic spring consisted of steel plates piled on top of one another and pinned together; it is the same method still used in rear suspensions. His invention was a major breakthrough in carriage design and it inspired a boom in the construction and sale of lightweight private carriages.
Ultimately, there was greater investment in roads and the beginnings of a national network. Travel by road until the 19th century was done on foot or on horseback. Other than local carts, goods were transported by pack animal. There was little if any investment in the roads which were nothing more than rough tracks or, at best, the remains of Roman roads. Any carriages and carts were forced by rough surfaces to go at a horse's walking pace only. Elliott's invention ensured stability and carriage travel became safe with a much smoother ride, subject to road repair and maintenance.
Elliott died at Plaistow in 1838 aged 75 and was buried with other members of his family at St Georges Church, Beckenham, Kent. He had married twice and had 12 children. On his death his estate comprised at least 5 large houses, 2 carriage workshops and a half share of the prosperous Westminster carriage firm of Elliott and Holbrook.

ASPIDER

ASPIDER is the group name for a series of companies that are mostly based in Europe. The company name has evolved over the years as a result of acquisitions, mergers and restructuring. The company is an MVNE (Mobile Virtual Network Enabler), providing mobile services to companies that want to control their own network. Clients include enterprises, manufacturers, integrators, and the mobile operators themselves.
History.
Following the merger of ASPIDER and MEC Solutions in 2004, the company traded as ASPIDER Solutions. Following the acquisition of NGI in 2014 the company traded as ASPIDER-NGI. ASPIDER sold aspects of its M2M business in 2010 to Wyless (which was subsequently purchased by Kore Wireless).
ASPIDER is traditionally known as a Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE), delivering services to a variety of operators and MVNOs and MNOs (Postmobile, Vodafone and T-Mobile). More recently the company has been delivering services to Enterprises, Manufacturers and other MVNEs (SURFnet, Kore Wireless). In the past couple of years, ASPIDER has been promoting eSIM and Remote SIM Provisioning- the embedded SIM standard by GSMA and has announced partnerships with various industry players for the use of eSIM in IoT initiatives (IDEMIA, Oracle).
ASPIDER's promotion of eSIM is notable because, when the initial specifications were announced, they were limited mainly to use-cases around operator selection and Remote SIM provisioning. ASPIDER has been promoting additional use cases more for enterprise applications - like authentication and identity management. The company has been working with industry groups like BTG to get pilots off the ground with companies like SURFnet.
Operations.
ASPIDER operated from a number of datacenters around the world and the largest of these was based in Malta. The Maltese operation included a full core network that interconnected to a number of operators, in particular with Vodafone Malta in order to launch a number of MVNOs in Malta. The core network components featured the usual manufacturers in Cisco and Oracle, but also smaller specialist vendors like Blueslice and BroadForward. ASPIDER had also acquired technologies from eSERVGlobal for a variety of messaging and communications components.
Locations.
The company headquarters are in the Netherlands, with offices in Belgium, UK, USA, France, New Zealand and Malta. In previous years the company also had offices in Seattle (US), Ireland and Egypt.

Adelaide Knight

Adelaide Knight, also known as Eliza Adelaide Knight, (1871–1950), was a British suffragette.
Biography.
Born in Tower Hamlets in 1871, Eliza Adelaide ("Addy") Knight was a frail child, born with deformed thumbs, who suffered two accidents in childhood which led to her enduring poor health. Due to her childhood injuries, she used a stick or crutches.
Arrest.
In 1906 suffragettes Knight, Annie Kenney, and Mrs. Jane Sbarborough were arrested along with Teresa Billington-Greig when they tried to obtain an audience with H. H. Asquith, a prominent member of the Liberals. Offered either six weeks in prison or giving up campaigning for one year, despite her poor health Knight chose prison, as did the other women. Annie Kenney, in her book autobiography, describes Knight as 'extraordinarily clever'.
Later life.
In 1905 Knight joined the Women's Social and Political Union and worked as secretary for the organisation's first East London branch in Canning Town, established by Annie Kenney and Minnie Baldock. She was co-opted onto the Central Committee of the WSPU, but resigned from the organisation in 1907 due to its lack of democracy, and having witnessed a false claim made by Christabel Pankhurst in order to promote enfranchisement for propertied women only.
Following this, Knight joined the Adult Suffrage Society and became the branch secretary for Canning Town. She also served as a Poor Law Guardian for West Ham. She developed a friendship with Dora Montefiore with whom she travelled to France in 1908 to address meetings there. In March 1909 Knight resigned as branch secretary, due to illness through pregnancy, and received letters of thanks. She moved from Plaistow to Abbey Wood later that year with her family. In 1920 she joined the Communist Party of Great Britain as a foundation member with Dora Montefiore but declined an invitation to join a delegation to the Soviet Union due to poor health.
In Abbey Wood she joined the Women’s Cooperative Guild and, together with her husband, the Independent Labour Party and the Workers Educational Association.
Family.
Adelaide and her husband, Donald Adolphus Brown, had four children between 1895 and 1901, three of whom died in a smallpox outbreak in 1902. Adelaide gave birth to another son in 1904 and a daughter in 1909. Brown (1874-1949) was a mixed-race sailor, the son of a Jamaican father and English mother, who eventually worked as a foreman at the Woolwich Arsenal, where he received a medal for bravery for tackling a fire there. 
Adelaide Knight died in 1950; her husband died a year earlier. Her daughter, Winifred Langton, wrote a memoir of her parents edited by Addy's granddaughter, Fay Jacobsen, entitled, "Courage".

Moto Harada

Mototsugu “Moto” Harada (原田 資嗣, "Harada Mototsugu"; born 1957 in Shimonoseki) is a Japanese concert pianist and composer.
Biography.
Moto Harada has played the piano since the age of three. He studied music and music pedagogics at the Tokyo University of the Arts. In 1980, Harada was taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna by Hermann Schwertmann and then took lessons from Jacob Lateiner at the Juilliard School in New York in 1982. One year later, he received a stipend from the Polish government and started studying at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music for two years under the supervision of Regina Smendzianka. During this period, Harada played at a variety of concerts and performed on radio and television. A stipend from Rotary International led him to the Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media where he successfully completed the concert examination by Karl-Heinz Kämmerling. Since 1988, Harada has been a piano teacher at the University of Hildesheim and has been invited by Chinese universities to give lessons several times.
Concert activity.
Parallel to his teaching responsibilities, Moto Harada also works as a concert pianist. His repertoire is centred on classical and romantic music (Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, etc), but also includes a wide range of virtuosic pieces (Ravel, Debussy, Gershwin, etc). Additionally, Harada is very familiar with modern music for the piano, having played the premieres of compositions from Witold Szalonek, Gyu-Bong Yi and others. His concert activities have also led him abroad and to several other European countries. Since 2000, Harada has been a regular performer at the music festival of Seelze.
Compositions.
Harada’s compositions combine classical elements of European and Asian music with innovative techniques used in modern music. Most of his pieces are based on a musical theme or utilize motives to create a specific atmosphere via means used in program music. This allows the audience to emotionally connect to the music and helps them understand the expressed mood. His compositions mainly consist of music for solo pianists in varying degrees of difficulty, but also include chamber music and pieces for singers. On November 6th, 2016, his piano concert premiered in the St. Michael church in Hildesheim.
Harada’s compositions are published by Olms Weidmann. A collection of compositions for starting pianists titled “Album der Insel Spiekeroog” is available for free online. Further compositions include:

2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships – Women's 3000 metres

The women's 3000 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 1 March 2018.
Summary.
In the first running event at these championships, world record holder Genzebe Dibaba was back to defend her title, while none of the women she vanquished returned, though Laura Muir, Sifan Hassan and Meraf Bahta had beaten Dibaba in her outdoor 1500 meltdown from the previous year.
The race took off at a leisurely pace, with Muir taking the pack through a 1:15.31 first lap, marked by 5000 world champion Hellen Obiri. Hassan and Dibaba chose to lead from behind, taking the back of the pack. The next 400 was even slower, 1:20.45. With that, Konstanze Klosterhalfen tired of the slow pace and took the lead. With the injection of pace, Dibaba decided to move forward on the next straightaway to mid pack, then with a big acceleration on the next straightaway. As Dibaba passed, her teammate Fantu Worku popped out of the pack to tag along, both reaching a gap at the front behind Klosterhalfen. The third lap split was 1:12.23, but with the exchange in the lead it was considerably faster for Dibaba in particular. Obiri and Bahta wanted to tag along with Dibaba, pushing forward to her shoulder, while at the back Hassan moved up a few places as the field strung out. The next 400 was accomplished in 1:09.67. Just before 2000 meters, passed in 6:07.62 (a 1:08.96 split) Dibaba accelerated into the lead. That triggered Hassan to move forward. Klosterhalfen, Muir, Bahta and Worku attempted to hold on, but the only one to stay with Dibaba was Obiri at first. As Hassan accelerated past, Klosterhalfen and Muir followed her to bridge the gap. Dibaba ran the next 400 in 1:07.56. The pace was too much for Obiri as she broke, going backward through the field as Hassan and Muir chased a new gap by Dibaba. The gap widened as Dibaba laid down a 1:02.43 split. Through the final lap, Hassan gained slightly on Dibaba, but could't make enough progress. Dibaba coasted across the finish line with the win. Behind her Hassan let off the gas, while Muir launched a final kick, almost catching Hassan at the line.
Results.
The final was started at 20:15.

Pop Singer (John Cougar Mellencamp song)

"Pop Singer" is a song by American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp (then under the stage name "John Cougar Mellencamp"), released on April 29, 1989, from Mellencamp's tenth studio album "Big Daddy". Mellencamp wrote the song himself, in response to how the music industry was attempting to hide his "real" image, which included adopting one of his previous stage names, Johnny Cougar. The single was moderately successful worldwide, reaching number one in Canada and New Zealand, number eight in Australia, and number 15 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100.
Background.
In a 1987 interview with "Creem", Mellencamp said, "The most crucial thing for me is that I want it to be real." Referring to his false image in his early years as a musician, Mellencamp was upset with the choices his manager made, including performing under the stage name "Johnny Cougar". Mellencamp wanted to focus solely on his music and not his image, so he began to exert more control over his musical career. As a result, he avoided common practices that musicians undertake, including meet-and-greets and radio station concerts. Many fans appreciated this change of style, particularly the devotion he had to his work.
Mellencamp wrote "Pop Singer" in the midst of a divorce with Victoria Granucci, at which point he began to analyze what he had become as a musician, referring to his image as a "monster" in an interview with "Rolling Stone" magazine. He also claimed, "Things were changing. Everybody was having to kiss everybody's ass. If you want to be on MTV, then come here and do this. All these backroom deals were getting made. I was like, 'I don't want any part of this.'"

Air Component Command

Air Component Command (, FTS) was a part of the Joint Forces Command of the Swedish Armed Forces. The staff was located at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters in Stockholm. The Air Component Command commanded the operations of the Swedish Air Force.
History.
On 30 June 1994, the Air Staff was dissolved and ceased as a staff and authority. In its place, on 1 July 1994, the Air Force Command ("Flygvapenledningen") was formed in the newly established Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters and the Air Tactical Center ("Flygvapnets taktiska centrum") in Linköping. The Air Force Command, which was part of the newly established Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters, was a production unit which sorted directly under the authority of the head of the agency, that is, the Supreme Commander. The Air Force Tactical Center was in turn directly subordinate of the military commander of the Middle Military Area (Milo M).
On 1 July 1998, the Air Force Tactical Center, along with the Air Force Command, was reorganized and formed the Air Force Center ("Flygvapencentrum", FlygvapenC) and the Chief of Air Force Staff position was replaced by the Inspector General of the Air Force position on 30 June 1998 who became the commander of the Air Force Center. The Swedish Air Force' highest command was now localized to Uppsala.
The Defence Act of 2000 meant that more than 20 units and some 20 staffs were disbanded which were reduced to six. The Defence Act also resulted in the Air Force Center being disbanded as an independent staff, and instead, the Air Force Center, as of 1 July 2000, came to operate as the Air Force Tactical Command ("Flygvapnets taktiska kommando", FTK). The Air Force Tactical Command was one of three tactical commands within the Joint Forces Command (OPIL). On 1 January 2003, the position the Inspector General of the Air Force position was changed to Inspector of the Air Force.
On 1 April 2007, the command was reorganized, and it received it current name was the Air Component Command ("Flygvapnets taktiska stab", FTS). The Air Component Command was then organized under Joint Forces Command. In 2007, the Swedish Air Force's highest command was again re-located to Stockholm. Since 1 January 2014, there is once again a position like Chief of Air Force, this time in the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters's Training &amp; Procurement Staff ("Produktionsstaben").
In February 2018, the Swedish Armed Forces proposed in its budget for 2019 to the Government a reorganization of the command structure. The proposal was, among other things, designed with a new command and new organizational units in new locations. This was to provide better conditions for a robust and sustainable command. The new organizational units that the Swedish Armed Forces wanted to form were proposed to be named the Army Staff, the Air Staff and the Naval Staff. These would be formed by a merger of the Training &amp; Procurement Staff and the Joint Forces Command, as well as other complementary parts from the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters and the Defence Materiel Administration. The staffs were proposed to be formed on 1 January 2019 and commanded by an army chief, a naval chief and an air force chief.

Gentiana paradoxa

Gentiana paradoxa, the Caucasian gentian, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gentianaceae, endemic to the foothills of the Greater Caucasus Mountains in western Asia, near the Black Sea. A compact, mat-forming herbaceous perennial growing to tall and wide, its upright stems of grass-like, linear or lanceolate leaves bear clusters of 5 or 6 large, brilliant blue and white flowers in late summer. It is one of several species of gentians that are valued in cultivation for the unusual bright blue colour of their blooms. However, it is not particularly easy to grow, requiring moist, well-drained, lime-free soil and a position in full sun. It is quite rare in nature.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

List of female chefs with Michelin stars

History.
The "Michelin Guide" was first published in 1900 in France, to promote driving. In 1926, it began to specialise in fine dining reviews, introducing a single star system. The current three star system began in 1931, although three stars were not awarded until the 1933 edition.
The first women chefs to hold three Michelin stars came in that 1933 edition, namely Eugénie Brazier and Marie Bourgeois, although Brazier won three stars at both of her La Mère Brazier restaurants in Lyon and at Col de la Luère. She held all six for 20 years, and her record for holding the most stars stood until beaten by Alain Ducasse in 1998. It then stood as the record for a female chef, until Carme Ruscalleda won her seventh star across several restaurants.
Some female Michelin-starred chefs prefer not to make an issue out of their gender. For example, when three-star chef Dominique Crenn was named world's best female chef by the prestigious World's 50 Best Restaurants List in 2016, she was outraged, considering referring to her gender "diminishing, unnecessary and irrelevant".
Recent awards.
Following the Second World War, Marguerite Bise became the third woman to win three Michelin stars, at her restaurant Auberge du Père Bise in 1950. It is then often reported that there was a 50-year gap before Anne-Sophie Pic became the fourth woman to win a set of three stars, despite Bise's granddaughter Sophie regaining the family restaurant's three stars in 1985, and similar awards made by Michelin to female chefs such as Nadia Santini, Elena Arzak and Clare Smyth in the interim.
While the number of women chefs with Michelin stars have been increasing in recent years, they are still relatively few in number. This is due in part to the percentage of female chefs; 4.7% of chefs in the United States are women, while the figure is 20% in the United Kingdom. The low number of female chefs with stars has led to criticism of the Michelin Guide, alongside other issues such as the pay gap between male and female chefs.
The problem was raised with Michelin director Michael Ellis following the publication of the 2018 New York City edition, who said that the company "can't do anything" to resolve it. Subsequently, a spokesperson said "Increasingly, more women are entering the profession in this country and around the world. Michelin is not involved in culinary education or recruitment. We deeply value diversity of all kinds and are pleased to see the trend toward greater diversity in the culinary field."

Prüm explosion

On 15 July 1949 an ammunition depot on the hill of Kalvarienberg in the Eifel mountains exploded. The cause of the explosion, in which the town was heavily damaged and 12 people killed, was never discovered. The crater, which is still visible today, is one of the largest man-made explosion craters in existence. A cross on the Kalvarienberg ('Calvary Hill') commemorates the victims of the disaster.
History.
When the Siegfried Line (in German the "Westwall") was built in 1939, a standby bunker was constructed for the Wehrmacht inside the Kalvarienberg. The underground bunker was located 20 to 30 metres below the top of the hill and consisted of a 100-metre-long and a 60-metre-long tunnel. After the Second World War, French troops dumped 500 tons of ammunition there, which was supposed to be used to blow up the fortifications of the Siegfried Line. The population of Prüm knew about this storage and was concerned about it.
On 15 July 1949, there was a fire in the bunker. Prüm's Volunteer Fire Service sounded a fire alarm shortly before 7.00 pm and tried to put out the fire, but was unable to get into the deep galleries to reach the source of the fire. There was time to successfully extract them and to evacuate large parts of the population of Prüm, actions which saved many lives. The ammunition dump blew up around 8.22 pm. In the process, 250,000 m³ of rock, earth and bunker debris were thrown into the air, falling on Prüm. Twelve people were killed, 15 were injured and 965 people were left homeless. The water supply collapsed, telephone lines and some roads were completely destroyed. The hospital, school and post office, as well as numerous residential buildings were left in ruins. The explosion crater measured 190 × 90 metres and was over 20 metres deep. The explosion was even registered by earthquake observatories.
This was the second time in short succession that Prüm had been devastated. During the war, 92 percent of the town had been destroyed by air raids and ground fighting. As Prüm was not completely rebuilt until 1949, 900 of its former inhabitants still lived outside the town.
After the explosion, the Luxembourg army from the garrison in Bitburg and the French army with its medical services gave assistance to the town. The fire brigades, teams from the German Red Cross from across the Eifel and the fire services of Koblenz and Neuwied were also involved in the rescue operation. Minister-President Peter Altmeier and Minister Johann Junglas hurried to the disaster area at night. There was much sympathy in the country and so the town was able to be rebuilt with the aid of donations.
The cause of the accident, which devastated Prüm and the surrounding area, was never ascertained. The suspicion that it was an act of sabotage was still held by some of the population even 60 years later. At the end of the 1990s, the Minister of Defence, Rudolf Scharping and the French National Archives, worked jointly to try and find an explanation but without success.
In 1979, a seven-metre-high commemorative cross, made of basalt and created by artist, Johann Baptist Lenz from Oberkail, was erected on the Kalvarienberg in remembrance of the explosion.

B.A.N. (Atlanta)

"B.A.N." is the seventh episode in the first season of the FX series "Atlanta". The episode depicts Paper Boi being interviewed on "Montague", a talk show on the fictional Black American Network (B.A.N). The entire episode is shot in the style of a block of television programming and includes both footage from the talk show and fake commercials.
The episode originally aired on October 11, 2016. It was written and directed by series creator Donald Glover. Glover won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series and was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for directing the episode.
Plot.
After Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) makes a controversial tweet stating that he would never have sex with Caitlyn Jenner, Earn gets him a spot on an interview show hosted by Franklin Montague (Alano Miller) on the B.A.N. (aka the Black American Network). In the awkward interview, Paper Boi debates with fellow guest, transgender activist Dr. Deborah Holt (Mary Kraft). At first the two clash over race and gender, but later come to some agreement. The interview deteriorates into arguing when a new guest named Antoine Smalls (Niles Stewart) joins the round table. Smalls believes that his name is Harrison Booth and he is a 35 year-old white man from Colorado.
Meanwhile, a series of Dodge Charger commercials air on the channel, but they prove to just be a surreal interlude of an Atlanta man (Tim McAdams) celebrating his divorce. Other commercials air during the segment, including ads for real-life products like Arizona iced tea, Mickey's malt liquor and Swisher Sweets, as well as fictional items like Coconut Crunchos Cereal and a dubious self-improvement service.
The Coconut Crunchos segment is a reference to police brutality.
Production.
Donald Glover wrote and directed "B.A.N"; however, he does not appear onscreen in the episode. His character Earn is addressed briefly by Paper Boi, implying he is either off-camera or backstage at the studio where "Montague" is filmed. The characters of Darius and Van do not appear in the episode either.
Reception.
The episode earned mixed reviews from critics. Joshua Alston of "The A.V. Club" wrote that the episode "feels a little too experimental", while "The Washington Post" praised the episode and said that "Atlanta" is "the most random yet thought-provoking show on television".
Glover won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for directing the episode. He is the first black director in the history of the Emmys to win this particular award. He was also nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode.

Ray Ciccarelli

Raymond J. Ciccarelli (born January 20, 1970) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He competes part-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 49 Chevrolet Silverado for his own team, CMI Motorsports. He has also competed in what are now the ARCA Menards Series and ARCA Menards Series East in the past.
Racing career.
ARCA Racing Series.
Ciccarelli drove part-time in the series in 2014, 2015, and 2016 for teams Carter 2 Motorsports, Kimmel Racing, Hamilton-Hughes Racing, and Hixson Motorsports. He started his own team, Ciccarelli Racing, for 2017. The team's first race came in the season-opener at Daytona where Ciccarelli finished 21st in his No. 38 Ford after a solid seventh-place qualifying run. The team returned at Talladega, although they used owner points from the full-time Hixson Motorsports No. 3 car to have a better shot of qualifying for the race (which they successfully did). Using that number instead of the No. 38 (which had only run Daytona), they picked up a thirteenth-place finish in the race. Ciccarelli had driven for the Hixson team in a few races in 2016.
Truck Series.
In 2017, Ciccarelli made his Truck Series debut in the Eldora Dirt Derby, driving the No. 10 truck for Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing. He started 32nd and finished 22nd. After that, he start-and-parked the No. 0 truck for the same team in 4 races at Michigan, New Hampshire, Texas, and Phoenix. He finished 26th, 29th, 28th, and 26th respectively. He returned to the No. 10 truck at Homestead. He qualified 31st, but an engine malfunction before the green flag waved gave him a 32nd-place finish.
In 2019, Ciccarelli acquired trucks, equipment, and owner points from the closed Premium Motorsports No. 49 truck and restarted his own team, now under the name CMI Motorsports, which stood for "Ciccarelli Moving &amp; Installation", a company owned by Ciccarelli and which is one of the team's sponsors. After running the first two races of the season, Ciccarelli and the CMI Motorsports team skipped the third round at Las Vegas with a planned comeback for the fourth round at Martinsville.
Planned departure from NASCAR announcement.
Ciccarelli made headlines in June 2020 when he announced his retirement from NASCAR as a driver and a team owner at the end of the 2020 season. His announcement, which came in the form of a post on his Facebook page on June 10, was made on the same day as NASCAR's decision to ban the display of the Confederate flag from their events, a decision they made in the midst of the George Floyd protests due to the flag's longtime association with white supremacist groups. While many NASCAR drivers praised the ban, Ciccarelli decried it, as he believed that it and other recent decisions by the sanctioning body ventured into the realm of politics.
However, Ciccarelli's team, CMI Motorsports, would post on their Twitter account on October 30 that "We're not done yet. See you all in 2021.", which indicated that he would not close down his team after the 2020 season as planned. On November 19, when it was revealed on TobyChristie.com that Tim Viens would continue as a driver for CMI, Ciccarelli told the website that he planned on driving in three to four races in 2021, and therefore cancelling his plans to retire as a driver.

The women's 60 metres at the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships took place on 2 March 2018.
Summary.
Carolle Zahi led the opening heats with her personal best of 7.11. Murielle Ahouré showed her cards in the semi-final round, her 7.01 .06 faster than the top sprinter in the world the last couple of seasons, Elaine Thompson. 7.01 would have been fast enough to win the final.
In the final, Ahouré blasted out of the blocks. With short quick, strides she had opened up a metre lead over Zahi, 20 metres into the race. The rest of the contenders formed a line across the track, only Remona Burchell was beaten at this point. The first to run down Zahi was returning silver medalist Dafne Schippers as Zahi faded. Schippers also faded, the battle in the center of the track was between Mujinga Kambundji and Marie-Josée Ta Lou, with Thompson inches behind. With her pursuers in full flight, Ahouré's lead shrunk slightly, but was insurmountable. Ta Lou and Kambundji crossed the line together, Ta Lou getting the silver by .005 over Kambundji.
It was the first gold medal for the Ivory Coast, made more remarkable by the fact that it was a one-two sweep for the nation.

Bedřich Nikodém

Bedřich Nikodém (also Friedrich Nikodem and Fritz Nikodem; August 12, 1909 - July 19, 1970) was a male Czech international table tennis player, later active as a composer, lyricist and musician. He appeared in the 1930s under the pseudonym Niki Němec.
Life.
Nikodém was born in Vienna the son of an engineer. In 1921, the family moved to Brno, Czechoslovakia. According to his paternal wish, Friedrich Nikodem continued the family tradition and completed his engineering studies in Prague. His main interest, however, was sports and music.
At the end of the 1920s, Fritz Nikodem was one of the best table tennis players in the country and from 1929 to 1933 belonged to the Czech national team. He won a bronze medal at the 1930 World Table Tennis Championships and a silver medal at the 1931 World Table Tennis Championships in the team event. The following year in 1932 he won a gold medal in the team event at the 1932 World Table Tennis Championships for Czechoslovakia.
Afterwards Nikodém devoted himself entirely to music. During the Great Depression, he earned a living as a bar pianist. Under the pseudonym Niki Němec, he participated in recordings with various Dixieland dance orchestras. During this time, the first songs of his own gained popularity. In 1935, he began collaborating with the music publisher Mojmír Urbánek, who continued under the successor companies Orbis, Státní hudební vydavatelství and Supraphon.
In the 1940s, Nikodém dedicated himself primarily to swing music, and some of his songs from the 1950s became classics. In the 1960s, Nikodém's compositional work shifted to rock and roll. During this time he also worked as a scribe and editor, and promoted Karel Svoboda and the brothers and Ladislav Štaidl. Nikodém succumbed to a heart attack in 1970.
The city of Ostrava honored Bedřich Nikodém in 1983 with the designation of a 2.3-kilometer-long road in the district of Poruba.

Friction stir spot welding

Friction stir spot welding is a pressure welding process that operates below the melting point of the workpieces. It is a variant of friction stir welding. 
Process description.
In friction stir spot welding, individual spot welds are created by pressing a rotating tool with high force onto the top surface of two sheets that overlap each other in the lap joint. The frictional heat and the high pressure plastify the workpiece material, so that the tip of the pin plunges into the joint area between the two sheets and stirs-up the oxides. The pin of the tool is plunged into the sheets until the shoulder is in contact with the surface of the top sheet. The shoulder applies a high forging pressure, which bonds the components metallurgically without melting. After a short dwell time, the tool is pulled out of the workpieces again so that a spot weld can be made about every 5 seconds.
The tool consists of a rotating pin and a shoulder. The pin is the part of the tool that penetrates into the materials. Both the pin and the shoulder may be profiled to push the plasticized material in a particular direction and to efficiently break-up and disperse the oxide skins on the adjacent surfaces. After retracting the tool, a hole remains, when using one-piece tools, which have already proven themselves as very reliable in the automotive and the rail vehicle industry. Often the rotating tool is surrounded by a non-rotating clamping ring with which the workpieces are pressed firmly against each other before and during welding by applying a clamping force. The clamping ring can also be used to reduce the pressing out of plasticized material to avoid the formation of burrs or beads to apply inert gas or to cool the tool via compressed air.
The most important process parameters are the speed and contact pressure. This results in the plunge feed rate for a given workpiece material. Modern spot welding guns can be used either via position control or force control or via a product-specific programmed force-displacement control. Often, position control is used until a certain displacement is reached, and then the control system is switched to force control during the dwell time. Even during the force-controlled dwell time, certain position values can be specified, which should not be undermatched or exceeded.
Spot welding guns.
Friction stir spot welding is performed with a spot welding gun, which is mounted on a console, flanged to an articulated robot or manually operated with a balancer to the component.
Process advantages.
Friction spot welding is characterized by a number of process advantages. Any damage to the material caused by the extreme heat, such as that produced by laser or arc welding, will not occur. In particular, in the case of artificially aged aluminum alloys, the strength in the weld seam and the heat-affected zone is much higher than in conventional welding methods.
Industrial use.
Friction stir spot welds have a high strength, so they are even suitable for parts that are exposed to particularly high loads. In addition to automotive and rail vehicle construction, the aerospace industry is developing the process e.g. for welding cockpit doors for helicopters. In the electrical industry aluminum and copper can be friction stir spot welded. Other applications are in façade and furniture manufacture, where the low heat input, especially in anodized sheets, leads to excellent optical properties.

Etherley railway station

Etherley railway station served the village of Witton Park in County Durham, North East England, from 1847 to 1965 on the Wear Valley line. It was briefly reopened during the summers of 1991 and 1992 as Witton Park.
History.
The Bishop Auckland and Weardale Railway (BA&amp;WR) passed through the future site of Etherley station upon its opening between and in November 1843 and was extended to by the Weardale Extension Railway (WXR) in 1845. However, the first station to serve the area did not open until Etherley &amp; Witton Park was opened by the Wear Valley Company on 14 April 1847, shortly before the opening their line between the (BA&amp;WR) at and on 3 August 1847. Originally it was only open on market days and only appeared in timetables from September 1847. The Weardale Extension Railway had linked with the Derwent Railway at Waskerley when it first opened but the use of inclines in the area meant that it was not until 1859 (when a deviation was opened to bypass Nanny Mayors Incline) that trains from Etherley station were able to run through to . In 1862, the line to Frosterley was extended to by the Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway. The station was resited on 16 October 1867 and it was proposed that the original station be converted to cottages. The name was shortened to Etherley on 1 July 1871. On 21 October 1895, the final extension to the Wear Valley Line was opened by the North Eastern Railway between Stanhope and .
Much of the route of the WXR served a very sparsely populated area and increased competition from road transport led the then owner, the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER), to close the route north of to passengers on 1 May 1939. After the LNER was nationalised to form part of British Railways (BR), traffic on the lines through Etherley continued to decline and so the Wearhead branch was closed to passengers on 29 June 1953 and passenger services on the former WXR line was curtailed at on 11 June 1956. The station did, however, remain open as a stop on the remaining section of the WXR until this too was closed to passengers on 8 March 1965. The Wearhead branch retained its goods service until 1961 when it was cut back to before being further reduced to terminate at the Cement Work just to the west of in 1968. The station itself was closed to goods traffic on 1 November 1965.
Though the tracks were lifted on the Crook line by early 1968, the curtailed Wear Valley Line remained open to provide rail access to the Blue Circle cement works (later owned by Lafarge) and in 1988 BR introduced a summer Sunday extension to the regular to 'Heritage Line' service to Stanhope. As this passed through the site of Etherley station, a campaign was started by the local residents to reopen the station. As a result of this campaign, the station was briefly reopened during the summer of 1991 as a stop on the extended 'Heritage Line' service. However, the service was withdrawn after the summer of 1992 and on 17 March 1993, the freight service to cement works (the last remaining traffic on the line) was withdrawn as it was decided to switch to road haulage.
The track was, however, mothballed and a campaign began in 1993 to preserve the line as a heritage railway. Weardale Railways Limited purchased the line in 2004 and reopened it between and Stanhope in July 2004. However the organisation struggled financially and the service was suspended a short time later, not recommencing until August 2006. After major efforts to clear the line of vegetation and repair damaged tracks, passenger services along the section between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland through Etherley were reintroduced 23 May 2010 and continued until the end of the 2012 season. Over this period, trains ran non-stop between Wolsingham and Bishop Auckland though it was suggested that Etherely could be reopened in the future.
Since 2014, the Railway Trust has operated passenger trains on selected weekdays and weekends for mostly tourist traffic using a class 122 "Bubble Car". Initially, this only ran between Wolsingham and Stanhope but, on 27 March 2016, this service was extended to Witton-le-Wear. In April 2018, the Weardale Railway CIC announced that works had commenced to lift a short section of track at Broken Banks (approximately 1/2 mile west of Bishop Auckland station) to enable the embankment to be repaired after subsidence had made the line unusable for passenger traffic. Once the works are complete it is intended to reinstate the tracks and extend the Stanhope to Witton-le-Wear passenger service back to Bishop Auckland West station from July 2018. This extension makes the prospect of reopening Etherley station more feasible.

Doctor (2013 film)

Doctor (Hangul: 닥터) is a South Korean body horror film written and directed by Kim Sung-hong, starring Kim Chang-wan in the lead role of a plastic surgeon who performs strange body experiments on his victims. A woman then goes to the plastic surgeon to seek out the perfect body. Through the surgery the women does receive the perfect body but also must now live out two separate lives. Actress Bae So-eun made her debut with the film. The film had its world premiere at the 17th Busan International Film Festival.
It was released in South Korea on 20 June 2013.
Plot.
Choi In-beom (Kim Chang-wan) is a plastic surgeon married to Soon-jung (Bae So-eun). He is a psychopathic doctor who has different mood swings. One fine day, he leaves for a surgery and tells his wife that he would be late in arriving home. As he leaves, Soon-jung shows her real side and hatred for her. She gets a call from Yong-kwan (Seo Gun-woo), who later arrives at her home. Still there, In-beom secretly enters his house to find out about the guy and witnesses Soon-jung committing adultery. He feels betrayed and tries to kill her, but her mother rings the doorbell and both In-beom and Yong-kwan escape separately. The latter is spotted by the mother who asks Soon-jung to calm down. It is revealed that Soon-jung's mother planned the marriage so that she could herself get whatever luxuries she wanted and to get her daughter, a cosmetic surgery.
In-beom follows Yong-kwan and finds out about him. Yong-kwan is visited by Soon-jung's mother who warns him not to meet her again. In-beom soon visits her and tricks her into giving her a BOTOX injection, and instead kills her. At night, he gifts Soon-jung with a special meat and as she eats it, he laughs and reveals that it was her mother's thigh. Shocked, Soon-jung threatens In-beom with a knife. In-beom breaks a bottle over her head, leaving her unconscious and drags her into a dark room.
In-beom's mood swings make his nurses suspect him. He is soon visited by a young lady willing to get a breast surgery, whom he decides to surgically enhance to take Soon-jung's place and starts the surgery without the consent of one of his senior nurses. As she refuses to help him, he kills her along with another nurse who decides to stop the surgery in between. The lady dies due to lack of proper treatment. Nurse Kim gets shocked to find blood and dead bodies. As she is about to leave, In-beom fantasizes her to be Soon-jung and tries to kill her but she escapes and eventually calls the police. In the meanwhile, Yong-kwan finds out about In-beom and breaks into his house to find Soon-jung bound and gagged. He takes her to a hospital. In the meanwhile, the police start investigating and discover that Soon-jung is actually a copy of another lady.
While in hospital, In-beom secretly injects Soon-jung with a special drug, making her unable to speak. Yong-kwan too gets injected and beaten down badly by him. He slashes Soon-jung's left eyelid and rest of her face, and leaves amidst chaos and police looking for him.
After an year, a patient with a plastic surgery comes to the doctor's cabin and as his face is being revealed, a flashback shows that In-beom had killed a roadside man and taken his identity card, not before injuring his own face severely. As he now asks for a mirror to see his face, the doctor asks him if he's satisfied. In-beom shows his satisfaction but speaks out that he used to like his name, In-beom, a lot. He starts laughing and the camera cuts to black before his new face is seen.
Reactions.
In the year 2015, the lead actor Kim Chang-wan in an interview said that his decision to star in the film was a mistake and he had done so only to find out the mentality of the people who try to make this movie.
Actress Bae So-eun caught the audience attention due to her graphic nudity in the film.
Reception.
Paul Quinn from "Hangul Celluloid" wrote "With 'Missing' having appeared to point to Kim Seong-hong as a director with a talent for realising visceral narratives in almost shocking but nonetheless gripping form, I for one was hopeful that 'Doctor' would further build his reputation within the horror genre. Sadly, though 'Doctor' is indeed notable it is so for largely the wrong reasons.
A reviewer at HanCinema wrote "Doctor might be an interesting enough thriller while it establishes its elements, which are not groundbreaking by any stretch."

Shirley Aley Campbell (1925 – August 13, 2018) was a figurative realist painter, called "Cleveland’s own artistic blend of Alice Neel and Lucien Freud".
Quotes.
"Campbell’s art explores the vast range of the human condition. She paints strippers, celebrities, hookers, politicians, bullfighters, burlesque queens, alcoholics, and motorcyclists. Pursuing her subjects with the intensity of a reporter, she travels to observe people performing daily tasks in familiar surroundings, interviews them, and fills page after page with sketches. Despite the obvious opportunity for social or political commentary, she focuses on the common humanity of her subjects and presents each with individual compassion." —Mindy Tousley, Executive Director, The Artists Archives of the Western Reserve
"Shirley Aley Campbell has created a luminous career painting the invisible people. Or, as she says: the ugly ones, the ones who have had misery, but who don't give up on life. For decades, that has meant she's painted the people most Clevelanders overlook: prostitutes, drag queens, gays and lesbians, and transgender individuals in a time when acceptance wasn't as readily available as today." —Laura DeMarco, "The Plain Dealer"
Life and career.
Shirley Aley Campbell grew up in Cleveland and attended Collinwood High School. Her talent for drawing was recognized early, and she was encouraged to attend Saturday morning art classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Her teacher Milton J. Fox was highly influential at this early stage in her life. "Mr. Fox opened her mind, and her eyes and her ears to the whole world of the arts: he explained the bones and muscles of the body so that a young person could understand ... Mr. Fox was without doubt the person who set the course of Shirley Aley's life."
She attended Cleveland Institute of Art, where some of her instructors were artists of the "Cleveland School"—Paul Travis, Kenneth Bates, Frank Wilcox and William Eastman. These instructors guided her to "envision the parts that comprised the total human figure and the whole composition". Campbell distinguished herself at the Cleveland Institute of Art and graduated with the top honor awarded by the school, the Agnes Gund Memorial Scholarship. This enabled her to travel to Estes Park, Colorado, to study with designer Emmy Zweybruck. In 1949 she married Robert Campbell, a student of commercial art at the Cleveland Institute of Art, with whom she moved to New York, to study at the Pratt Institute of Art and the Art Student's League.
In 1954, Campbell made Cleveland, Ohio, her home and thus began her career as a figurative artist of Northeast Ohio. In 1957, she received the First Award for Painting in the Cleveland Museum of Art Annual May Show for "Requiem for Dominic". This painting was purchased and is now in the permanent collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art.
Campbell's paintings and drawings include many works that can be called portraits. Campbell herself, however, prefers to call them "figure studies". This is because, in the words of her biographer, Elizabeth McClelland, "Portraiture is possibly one of the most misunderstood and abused forms of all the visual arts. ... A revealing and horrifying experience is looking at the commemorative portraits of former executives in the corporate headquarters of commercial establishments. Their stern and purposeful faces may be represented by hand tinted photographs, or still worse, by portraits painted from photographs. It is portraiture at its lowest ebb."
Campbell's "portraits" do the opposite: "in studying her subjects, [Campbell] intuits, and interprets more than just physical features. She processes the facets of the personalities." One of Campbell's notable portraits is entitled "Five Figure Exercise, Opus One", now in the permanent collection of the Butler Institute of American Arts. It depicts a group of persons who had in some way influenced Campbell's life: industrial designer Leon Gordon Miller, director of the Butler Institute of American Art Joseph Green Butler, chairman of the Humanities Department of Cuyahoga Community College Lawrence Vincent, literary critic and lecturer Eugenia Thornton Silver, and enamelist John F. Puskas. Campbell also painted a portrait of Art Nouveau lecturer Berenice Kent which was featured in the "Washington Post" in 1972. "Campbell’s interests have extended to celebrities (actress Margaret Hamilton, chanteuse Hildegarde), politicians (congresswomen Bella Abzug of New York and Mary Rose Oakar of Cleveland), fellow artists (Phyllis Seltzer, David E. Davis, Judy Takács, and Mindy Tousley), pianist Eunice Podis, race car driver Janet Guthrie, Olympic athlete Stella Walsh. Campbell's portrait of Mary Rose Oakar is discussed in the "Plain Dealer" by critic Steven Litt: "What matters most is Campbell’s ability to evoke a sense of Oakar’s sturdy body pressing against the snug folds of her leather coat. In Campbell’s better portraits, you never doubt there’s warm, breathing flesh under the clothing her subjects wear."
Cleveland "Plain Dealer" art critic Helen Cullinan praised Campbell's “"intimate, honest and often searing depiction, not only of the human face and figure, but of the human condition". She also called her an "acutely socially aware painter". This is especially apparent in her Burlesque Series, which she worked on from 1965 to 1967. The models for these large-scale figure paintings were the strippers at Cleveland's old Roxy Theater. Talking with these women backstage, Campbell "learned the histories of their sad and often tragic lives and accepted their pretenses of having college degrees or reading Ecclesiastes. […] A biographical connection between artist and subject establishes a rapport that extends to and is expressed in the painting, so we can not only see the individual but also get a sense of the conditioning that has shaped her life." In 1966, the show, "Backstage Burlesque," opened at the Dickson Yates Gallery in Georgetown, and a writer for the "Washington Star" complained that "all the noise when strippers from the Gayety Theater invaded Georgetown for the opening of "Backstage Burlesque", tended to obstruct a quiet view of the paintings." When the exhibition was shown at the Artzt Gallery in New York the following year, "Art News" critics noted "poses that reveal without sentimentality all the ill, the fat, the sag that flesh is heir to" and paintings that were "well-composed and skillfully painted mementos of mortality".
The burlesque paintings, among others, were shown in Campbell's 1994 retrospective exhibition at Lakeland Community College, "From the '60's Burlesque to the Biographical '90s—A Personal Vision". Professor Walter Swyrydenko, chairman of the Fine Arts Department and gallery director, wrote, "In Campbell's most recent biographical series, one senses her strength and clarity of purpose. The artist, in her personal quest, shares with us a glimpse of this rare quality—the human spirit undaunted".
In 1973, Campbell began work on the commission she is perhaps best known for—her "Motorcycle Series". She was commissioned by motorcycle aficianado and Cleveland businessman Joseph M. Erdelac to paint motorcycles and their riders. Erdelac sent Campbell to "Florida, the east and west coasts, England, France, Finland, and Sweden attending biking events and studying […] bikers. She sketched and photographed the figures and the motorcycles to make sure all the details were correct." "The series depicts the many ways in which motorcycles are used and reveals the wide range of people who ride them. Subjects include The Flying Angel herself, Debbie Lawler; the late John Burke, an eminently successful businessman, and his two sons; Swedish racer Kent Anderson; Dot Robinson, one of the best known women riders, who has owned a motorcycle dealership and continues to log thousands of miles a year on her pink Harley; John Knoble and Bob “Laco” Lawrence of the Hells Angels Los Angeles motorcycle Club; Abram Drain, one of the few black motorcycle competition riders; and Lord Hesketh of England, a motorcycle devotee and producer of Hesketh Motorcycles. The subject matter is diverse and [...] even includes a painting representative of a Vietnamese family fleeing Saigon [on a single motorcycle]."
In 1978, Campbell was honored with a Distinguished Alumnae retrospective exhibition by the Cleveland Institute of Art. The "Motorcycle Series" was shown at this exhibition.
In 1984, "Cleveland Magazine" included Shirley Aley Campbell as one of their "Most Interesting People", and in 1986, she was awarded the coveted Cleveland Arts Prize. She is featured with other Arts Prize winners in the 1995 book "Spirit of Cleveland: Visual Arts Recipients of the Cleveland Arts Prize, 1961–1995".
Her work has been exhibited in two solo shows at the Butler Institute of American Art, Cleveland Institute of Art, Canton Museum of Art, Cuyahoga Community College, College of Wooster, Baldwin-Wallace College and Karamu House.
An Invited Artist in 1972 and Purchase Award Winner in 1959, Campbell has been juried into the Butler Midyear Show at the Butler Institute of American Art each year she entered from 1954 to 1973. Campbell also won the highest award of First Place at the Annual Cleveland Museum of Art May Show for three consecutive years from 1957 to 1959. She was honored for this at the 1977 May Show Retrospective. Campbell has also won awards from The Women's City Club Foundation, Cleveland Institute of Art, and won First Place at the 1959 Chautauqua Exhibition.
Campbell's work is in the permanent collections of museums such as The Cleveland Museum of Art, Butler Institute of American Art, Evanston Museum of Art and the Canton Museum of Art.
In 1999 Shirley Aley Campbell's work was permanently archived in the collection of The Artists Archives of the Western Reserve. As part of the archival process, she was photographed by Herbert Ascherman Jr.
In 2004, at almost 80 years old, Campbell focused on nude figure drawings and was the subject of "By Ones and Twos: Portraits in a New Age, New Works by Shirley Aley Campbell" at the Dead Horse Gallery in Lakewood. Dan Tranberg of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, wrote that the "predominantly gray figure studies […] show her to be zooming in on the nude figure as a kind of assemblage of strange forms. [a work entitled "Per Carnem III" depicts] the bare back of a male sitter almost as if it were a landscape. The painting's undulating light and dark brush strokes treat the figure as an expanse of vague mounds."
In 2011, Campbell's work was the focus of a three-part retrospective exhibition by The Cleveland Artists Foundation (now ArtNEO) entitled "The Way of All Flesh", spread among three venues across Greater Cleveland—the Beck Center for the Arts in Lakewood, the Cuyahoga Community College Eastern Campus in Highland Hills, and Convivium33 Gallery.
In 2015, Campbell's work was curated by Judy Takács into the Artists Archives of the Western Reserve group exhibition "Majority Rising: Cleveland's Female Gaze", along with the work of Kathleen McKenna, Lee Heinen, Marsha Sweet, and the late Marilyn Szalay. This exhibition was also featured in the "Collective Arts Network (CAN) Journal" and in "Cleveland Scene Magazine".
During her 70 years as a figurative artist in Cleveland, Shirley Aley Campbell was associate professor of drawing at both Cuyahoga Community College and the Cleveland Institute of Art. She retired as professor emeritus from Cuyahoga Community College in 1993 but still continued teaching small groups and privately. In 2014, Laura DeMarco of the Cleveland "Plain Dealer" wrote, "Today, Campbell paints another marginalized group in society: the elderly. Specifically, the residents of the Emerald Village Retirement Community, where the feisty artist lives." Campbell had an exhibition of these works in 2014, "The Beauty of Decadence" at the Maria Neil Art Project in Collinwood's Waterloo area.
Campbell died on August 13, 2018.
Art.
"Two Red Tulips is" characteristic of Campbell's paintings of the marginalized members of Society. It shows Transvestites and Burlesque Dancers.
"Vietnamese Family" is from Campbell's Motorcycle Series and depicts a family escaping from war-torn Vietnam on a single motorcycle.
Campbell's 1977 portrait of Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar is part of the permanent collection of the ArtNEO Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

Walter Budeus

Walter Budeus (29 October 1902 – 21 August 1944) was a German communist and resistance fighter against Nazism.
Biography.
Budeus was born in Zossen. He trained as a machine fitter, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1931. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Budeus was active in the underground communist resistance. In 1936, he set up an illegal resistance cell at the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken factory where he worked, organizing more than 50 workers.
From the late 1930s, Budeus worked closely with the resistance group led by Robert Uhrig, distributing pamphlets, making contacts with other resistance fighters and collecting information on arms production and the political mood of the German population. On 4 February 1942, Budeus was arrested by the Gestapo. He was detained for more than two years in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Brandenburg Prison before being sentenced to death by the People's Court on 7 June 1944. He was executed by guillotine on 21 August 1944 in Brandenburg-Görden Prison.
A street in the Friedrichsfelde locality of Berlin was named Walter-Budeus-Straße from 14 January 1976 until 1981.

2018 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina

The 2018 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina took place on March 1, 2018. It was a speech delivered by president Mauricio Macri at the National Congress of Argentina.
Contents and delivery.
Economy.
Macri pointed that unemployment and inflation are decreasing in the country. He said that if he had made reforms too quickly it would have caused an economic crisis, and if he did not made reforms the country would have faced a crisis similar to the one in Venezuela.
Education.
Macri commented that education in Argentina is in a poor state, citing the results of the "Aprender" exams. He considered that this would leave the new generations unprepared to access high quality jobs in the future. He criticized the unions of the sector, accusing them of neglecting the educative needs for political gain and only being concerned about wages.
Crime.
The president pointed that the country has a clear strategy for dealing with illegal drug trade, which would be bearing fruit. He also called to update the penal code. As for crime in general, he rejected both police brutality and pro-crime policies as viable solutions.
Abortion.
Although Macri defined himself as pro-life, he encouraged the Congress to have an abortion debate and discuss a potential abortion law.
Responses.
Former president Eduardo Duhalde criticized Macri and considered that his government does not seek enough political consensus for its actions. Former president and current senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her son, deputy Máximo Kirchner, did not attend the ceremony, and stayed at their home in Calafate.

Clara Wæver

Clara Marie Wæver (7 April 1855–18 August 1930) was a Danish embroiderer who in 1890 opened a successful business in Copenhagen. Recognized for its high quality, it also provided instruction and training in needlework for young women. In 1903, Wæver enhanced her wares by acquiring the studio where Constantin Hansen's daughters, Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesbøll, had worked, including all its artworks, models and designs. In 1917, she transferred ownership of the business which then became known as Eva Rosenstand Clara Wæver. It survives today in the centre of Copenhagen as Eva Rosenstand.
Biography.
Born in Stubbekøbing on the island of Falster on 7 April 1855, Clara Wæver was the daughter of Christian Pedersen Wæver (1821–1905), a skipper, and his wife Hanne Elizabeth Fester (1827–1913). The family name stemmed from her great-grandfather who was a weaver. In 1875, her father retired from the sea and moved to Copenhagen with his wife and his two daughters (Clara and Augusta). Clara Wæver took up needlework, taught in a girls school and worked in S.B. Wiegand's embroidery shop.
In 1890, she opened a retail needlework business on Vesterbrogade together with her younger sister who had just qualified as a teacher at N. Zahle's School. The business prospered, attracting customers from both the city and the countryside. By the end of the 19th century, it had gained a reputation for its high quality workmanship, in contrast to most of the other textile businesses in the city which were often associated with shoddy goods. Augusta ran the retail business while Clara became one of the city's few experts who were able to teach young women the art of needlework. At the time, it was important for fine young women to learn how to sow as when they married, they were expected to provide napkins, table cloths, bed linnen, shirts and handkerchiefs, all with embroidered rims and the family initials. Alternatively, the bride's parents could order embroidered articles from the Wævers' shop. As a result, in addition to those working in the shop, they employed a number of women who worked from home.
The Wævers undertook all kinds of needlework but they were particularly adept at cross-stitch work. Many of their patterns were inspired by designs developed by Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesbøll for their own needlework business on the basis of artwork created by the master painters of the Danish Golden Age. When they sold the business in 1903, Clara Wæver bought most of the designs and patterns which became part of her own developments. She also drew on the work of Kristian Møhl, Knud V. Engelhardt and Margrete Drejer. Her business began to supply embroidered goods to churches throughout the country, especially altar cloths and carpets. In 1903, the business moved into new premises, also on Vesterbrogade. In the face of difficulties in obtaining materials during the First World War, in 1917 Clara Wæver sold the business to N.C. Dyrlund.
Wæver died in Hellerup on 18 August 1930 and was buried in Vestre Cemetery.

The Montague Arms

The Montague Arms was a music venue located at 289 Queens Road, in the Telegraph Hill ward of Lewisham, on the borders of Peckham and New Cross in south-east London from 1967 until 2018. The pub venue was known for its eccentric decor; which included old fishing-boat lights, a 19th Century carriage containing a stuffed zebra, and an old diving suit.
History.
The Montague Arms was owned by Peter Hoyle from 1967, and managed by Stan and Bet Pownall who ran it until their deaths in 2012. The pub reopened in 2014 under the ownership of Noel Gale.
Whilst in charge Hoyle regularly performed, along with Peter London, as The Two Petes. They covered popular rock and pop songs with London on keyboards and vocals and Hoyle on drums. The duo put out a series of albums recorded live at the venue in the 1970s.
It once bore a sign reading 'Tourists Welcome, Coaches Welcome' as, before the launch of the Eurostar and availability of cheap flights to mainland Europe, it was a regular stopping point for those headed to the ferry at Dover.
In the 1970s, as well as live music, the pub also hosted live comedy. Mike Reid and Jim Davidson performed there early in their careers.
The pub was the location of a round table interview with Nick Cave, Mark E Smith, and Shane MacGowan published in the NME in 1989. The trio also took part in an impromptu jam session on the pub's small stage with Cave on organ, Smith on guitar and MacGowan on drums.
In January 2018 the current managers were forced to make some of the pub’s eight bar staff redundant and cancel upcoming gigs at short notice after they were informed that the pub had been sold. A Change.org petition was set up imploring the new owners to keep the venue as a live music venue which received over 9,000 signatures.
For its last three years it was the venue for an independently run LGBTQ+ friendly clubnight called Passionate Necking, as well as a monthly DIY comedy cabaret, Piñata.
In May 2018 the premises was reopened solely as a pub under new management with a "minimalist" aesthetic.
Despite the community's expectation that it was going to relaunch as a gastropub following the demolition of its iconic stage, the pub concentrated instead on cocktails and games, such as shuffleboard and table football. The pub failed to draw in enough custom and shut its doors again in July 2019.

Sigma (operations research)

Sigma (Science in General Management) was a limited company established by Henry Novy, Stafford Beer and Roger Eddison in 1961. It sold operational research OR in the United Kingdom and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director.
The consultancy arose following discussions between the Société d’Économie et de Mathématiques Appliquées (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the Connaught Hotel in October 1961.
Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the Gas Council, transportation, for British Rail and the Port of London Authority, shipbuilding, for the Geddes Committee, education for Yugoslavia, tourism, for Israel, nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms. 
Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom.

Catherine Rückwardt

Catherine Rückwardt (née Beckmann; born 7 April 1960) is a German pianist and conductor. She was Generalmusikdirektorin of the Staatstheater Mainz from 2001 to 2011, and has worked freelance since that time.
Career.
Born Catherine Beckmann in Los Angeles, the daughter of the conductor and pianist Irvin Beckmann and the singer Judith Beckmann, Rückwardt studied violin at the Musikhochschule Lübeck from 1975. She studied piano from 1981 at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, graduating in 1984. She further studied voice, accompaniment of Lieder ("Liedbegleitung"), and conducting, with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann Prey, among others. In 1995, she took a conducting class with Helmuth Rilling at the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart.
She worked at the Theater Bremen form 1984, first as a repetiteur, making her debut as a conductor in 1985 with Carl Zeller's operetta "Der Vogelhändler". From 1989, she was "Studienleiterin" and "Kapellmeisterin". She was Kapellmeisterin at the Frankfurt Opera from 1997 to 2001, when she became Generalmusikdirektorin of the Staatstheater Mainz. She was the first woman at the house in that position. She was one of only four women in a leading conducting position, of 76 opera houses in Germany. From 2006, she was also Intendantin of the Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Mainz. Her focus was the presentation of rarely performed operas and work with children and young people. She left the Mainz Theatre in 2011 to work as a freelance conductor. The program for her last symphony concert was typical in combining rarely played works with well-known repertory: beginning with Schönberg's "Begleitmusik zu einer Lichtspielszene", followed by a violin concerto by Nikolai Roslavets, rediscovered in 1989, and finally the Fourth Symphony by Johannes Brahms.
She recorded with the Mainz orchestra the First Symphony by Hans Rott and the musical Christmas play for children "Nussknacker und Mausekönig". She served as a member of the jury for the Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy Wettbewerb in Leipzig in the category viola.
Awards.
Rückwardt was awarded the ZONTA-Kunstpreis and the Gutenberg-Büste of Mainz.

1886 Peloponnese earthquake

The 1886 Peloponnese earthquake occurred at 23:27 local time (21:32 UTC) on 27 August. It had an estimated magnitude between 6.8 and 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of X ("Extreme") on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused extensive damage in Messenia, with the towns of Filiatra and Marathos both severely affected. Between 326 and 600 people were killed. It was felt over a wide area from the Khedivate of Egypt to Malta and possibly as far away as Bern and Marseille.
Tectonic setting.
The western side of the Peloponnese lies close to the convergent boundary between the Aegean Sea Plate and the African Plate. A major NNW-SSE trending thrust fault is mapped off the coast near the location of the 1886 event and displacement on this may have caused the earthquake.
Earthquake.
The earthquake occurred at about 23:30 local time, although contemporary reports give a range of times. The shaking lasted for between 40 and 60 seconds.
Intensities of ≥X on the Mercalli scale have been estimated from contemporary reports, with the highest intensity reported from Filiatra and Gargalianoi on the mainland and on the island of Zakynthos.
The aftershock sequence continued for about twelve months with the largest being on 2 March 1887.
A small tsunami was observed along the coast from Filiatra to Pylos with minor inundation. An underwater telegraph cable between Zakynthos and Crete was severed about 47 km south of Zakynthos, suggesting that the tsunami may have been caused by an underwater landslide triggered by the earthquake.
Flames out to sea.
Smoke and flames were reported out to sea about half an hour after the earthquake by Captain Aquilina of the "La Valette". This matches eyewitness accounts from the mainland of flames seen in the direction of the Strofades. Assuming that both observations were of the same phenomenon, it would be located about 150 km offshore. These observations were initially interpreted as a volcanic eruption, but the lack of any known previous activity combined with its location in the Mediterranean Ridge accretionary complex mean that this explanation is considered unlikely. The accretionary complex is known to have many mud volcanoes and the most likely cause of the flames is the spontaneous ignition of methane escaping from a mud volcano triggered by the earthquake.
Damage.
Severe damage was widespread throughout Messenia, with the towns of Filiatra, Koroni and Ligudista completely destroyed and Gargalianoi, Kyparissia and Messini badly affected. A further 160 villages were either destroyed or severely damaged. Six other towns and 65 villages suffered significant damage. About 6,000 homes were so damaged as to be unusable and 50,000 inhabitants were left homeless. Several bridges were either damaged or destroyed and a 3 km length of train track was damaged near Pyrgos.
The number of reported casualties varies widely, from 326 dead and 796 injured, 370 dead and 500+ injured, to 600 dead and an unknown number injured.

Geddes Committee

The Geddes Committee is the name by which the United Kingdom's Shipbuilding Inquiry Committee of 1965-6 was more generally known. It took this name from its chairperson, Reay Geddes, the managing director of Dunlop Rubber.
The Geddes Committee was appointed in February 1965. Their remit was to consider ways to save the shipbuilding industry in the United Kingdom by achieving greater competitiveness through organisational changes and in the methods of production. The Committee was sponsored by the Board of Trade.
They started gathering evidence from the Shipbuilding Conference and Shipbuilding Employers Federation, the Chamber of Shipping, the Dry Dock Owners and Repairers Central Council, the National Association of Marine Engineers, and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. 
The financial collapse of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company occurred in October 1965, leading to the "Fairfield Experiment".
The Geddes Committee published its report in 1966, calling for the reorganisation of UK shipbuilding into five large concerns. Harold Wilson's government accepted these recommendations and set up the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) through the Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967.

Accident.
On November 10, 2014, Brookbank suffered burns on 45 percent of her body when her home erupted in flames caused by a gas leak. Kilee had returned from Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington High School and smelled a foul odor. When she lit a candle to cover the smell, the house exploded around her. Brookbank was knocked out in the explosion but came to after persistent barking by her dog. She ran outside and was helped by neighbors.
Brookbank was taken to Shriners Hospitals for Children-Cincinnati, where she received treatment for 38 days, followed by extensive physical therapy. In January 2015, she returned to school, and in February she flew to Los Angeles to appear on "The Doctors" television program. During the segment, the producers surprised Brookbank with a visit from Justin Bieber.
Advocacy.
Later that year, Brookbank and her family formed the Kilee Gives Back Foundation, which held the first Kilee Brookbank Celebrity Golf Tournament.
In May 2016, Brookbank released her first book, "Beautiful Scars", which detailed her recovery from her burns. A portion of the proceeds from the book were to be donated to Shriners Cincinnati. Brookbank embarked on a book tour of Shriners hospitals in Cincinnati, Sacramento, California, and Boston, where she met with other burn survivors and their families.
Prom queen.
Also in May 2016, Brookbank was featured on "Inside Edition", a segment that followed Brookbank to her high school prom, where she was chosen as prom queen. The segment was picked up by numerous major media outlets, including "Seventeen", Yahoo! Style, PopSugar, AOL, Diply and Wimp.com.

Ben Carson office furnishing scandal

On February 27, 2018, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had spent $31,561 on a set of dining room furniture for the office of HUD secretary Ben Carson in late 2017, in apparent violation of federal law requiring Congressional approval for department head office redecoration costs exceeding $5000. Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) contradicted initial agency statements that the Secretary was uninvolved in the purchase decision, which took place amid extensive proposed budget cuts at that agency, affecting programs benefiting the poor and elderly. Media coverage of the purchase led to its cancellation. Inquiries into the propriety of the purchase were made by the Office of Special Counsel and House Oversight Committee.
The news of the office expenditures came amid questions over Carson's son's involvement in a HUD-sponsored "listening tour". Ben Carson Jr. is a federal contractor, and HUD lawyers warned the secretary that his involvement would constitute an apparent conflict of interest in violation of federal ethics rules; in February, Secretary Carson was pressured into requesting an investigation of his son's involvement by the inspector general of HUD.
HUD's inspector general cleared Carson of misconduct in September 2019.
Events.
Furniture order.
The custom-made furniture, ordered on December 21 from Sebree and Associates based in Carson's hometown of Baltimore, included a mahogany table, ten chairs with velvet upholstery, a sideboard, and a hutch. According to purchase documents and the dealer, the table pedestals featured "hand applied ebonized inlay with bell flowers topped by hand carved scrolls and a fluted column." Delivery was scheduled for May 2018.
Internal whistleblowing.
In November 2017, Helen G. Foster, former Chief Administrative Officer at HUD, filed a whistleblower complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, alleging that she had been demoted and transferred as retaliation after refusing to secure funding for the redecoration of the Secretary's office, as well as for exposing a $10-million budget shortfall, and for protesting being barred from handling certain FOIA requests. Foster stated that, beginning prior to Carson's confirmation in March, she had been repeatedly pressured by Carson's wife Candy Carson, through interim secretary Craig Clemmensen, to secure the funding in violation of the law. After conferring with HUD's acting assistant chief financial officer for budget on February 13, Foster claimed to have sent HUD officials the text of the Antideficiency Act requiring Congressional approval of the purchase. She reported being told "$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair."
A February 22 memo from HUD's Chief Financial Officer reiterated the rules surrounding redecoration costs, as well as costs associated with securing Secretary Carson's home.
Public statements from HUD officials.
On February 27, following initial media reports, HUD spokesman Raffi Williams initially claimed that HUD had spent only $3200 for new blinds for the secretary and deputy secretary's offices, and that the chairs then in the secretary's office had come from the basement of the HUD building. That same day, the organization American Oversight sued HUD to determine how much money had actually been spent on office redecoration.
On the evening of February 28, Carson and his wife denied any wrongdoing via Twitter. Carson claimed to be "as surprised as anyone" about the purchase.
Williams claimed that Secretary Carson and his wife had not requested the new table and were unaware of its purchase, and that the purchasing decision was made by career staffers, but that the secretary did not believe the cost to be excessive, and did not intend to return the items. However, internal emails released on March 14 – under a FOIA request made by American Oversight – contradicted those claims, with one message from a career staffer to Carson's assistant referring to "printouts of the furniture the Secretary and Mrs. Carson picked out". Presented with the discrepancy, Williams acknowledged that "when presented with options by professional staff, Mrs. Carson participated in the selection of specific styles."
Williams claimed that Congressional approval was not sought for the purchase because it addressed a "building-wide need", though the dining set would be located in Carson's personal suite. He also claimed that Foster's reassignment was part of a normal rotation.
On March 1, HUD confirmed that Carson had requested the furniture order be cancelled. HUD announced on March 15 that its chief financial officer Irving Dennis would lead a task force to combat "waste, fraud and abuse" at the agency.
On March 19, Carson testified before the House Appropriations Committee, claiming that he left the purchasing decision to his wife, and that they expressed concerns to staff over the cost. He denied that the furniture constituted a decorating expense, citing apparent safety concerns with the state of the old furniture, and he denied knowing about whistleblower Helen Foster. Congressman David Price, Democrat from North Carolina and ranking member of the committee, called the purchase one of several "major ethical lapses" at HUD, citing "failure to control funds and provide legally required notifications to Congress", "apparently false public statements that intended to obscure the truth about the secretary's involvement", and "the reassignment of the whistleblower who brought these problems to the public's attention."
Government investigations.
Following her initial complaint, Helen Foster was contacted for an interview with the Office of Special Counsel, which has 120 days from the date of the complaint to determine whether it will launch an official investigation. Foster's lawyer, Joe Kaplan, said the OSC could determine to move forward as quickly as the week of March 1.
Trey Gowdy, Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, requested records relating to HUD's furniture purchases in 2017, to "determine whether HUD adhered to the applicable spending limitations", as well as documentation relating to Helen Foster's claims of retaliation. Gowdy set a deadline of March 14 for the delivery of these documents.
In May 2019, the Government Accountability Office's general counsel confirmed to Congress that HUD broke the law when it ordered the dining set and a new dishwasher and water treatment system, specifically violating section 710 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Acts of 2016 and 2017, and the Antideficiency Act.
On September 12, 2019, HUD's inspector general released a report clearing Carson of misconduct.
Other reactions.
The White House was reportedly "furious" about negative stories surrounding spending at HUD, and anonymous sources reported the White House was taking a more active role to address the matter.
Editorials strongly criticized HUD's purchases and Carson's reaction. "Vanity Fair" called Carson's claimed lack of awareness of the purchase "truly amazing". "The Baltimore Sun" called the scandal part of a pattern in which Trump administration officials "shamelessly gamed the system for their personal benefit".
Late-night comedians mocked the purchase and HUD's response. Trevor Noah of "The Daily Show" said that valuing a good chair at $5000 would make Carson "the worst "Price Is Right" contestant", and suggested the department use the money to build low-income housing instead, in accordance with its mission. "Late Night" host Seth Meyers said of Carson that "the man loves furniture. Based on his personality he’s probably been mistaken for furniture."

Téméraire was a cutter aviso of the French Navy, commissioned in Lorient in December 1780.
Career.
Built by engineer Arnous-Dessaulsays after plans by Charles Segondat-Duvernet, "Téméraire" was started in July 1780 in Lorient, and commissioned in December. 
In July 1782, captured her off Brest. (British sources give the place of capture as 8–9 leagues WSW of Cape Clear.) "Téméraire" was armed with ten 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 50 men under the command of "lieutenant de frégate" Le Fer. She was nine days out of Brest and taking dispatches to the combined fleets. Before he struck Le Fer, her commander, threw overboard the dispatches, her logbook and papers, and eight guns. She then arrived at Cork. 
The French recaptured her in 1783 and recommissioned her in the French Royal Navy.

Marriott's Great America (Maryland–Virginia)

Marriott's Great America was a planned amusement park and resort which was proposed for two separate locations in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area in the early 1970s, with an intended opening date of 1976. The Marriott Corporation intended the park to be the centerpiece of its chain of Great America theme parks, alongside the completed parks that later became Six Flags Great America in Illinois and California's Great America in California. In both of the locations it proposed, Savage, Maryland, and Manassas, Virginia, Marriott encountered heavy opposition that made it impossible to proceed with the development plans. Later on, a third attempt at building the park was made in Guilford, Maryland, but the company had lost its enthusiasm and the project was dropped by 1980.
The area around Manassas would later face a similar controversy with the proposal of Disney's America.
First Maryland proposal.
In the early 1970s, the Marriott Corporation, owner of several restaurant chains as well as Marriott hotels, sought to branch further out into the tourism and vacation industry. The largest of the projects it took on was a chain of state-of-the-art theme parks, each of which would be called "Marriott's Great America" and themed around American history, opening in time for the bicentennial of 1976. From the beginning, three parks were planned, as Marriott identified three underserved metropolitan areas that could support a major amusement park: Baltimore–Washington, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Chicago-Milwaukee.
Early in the planning process, Marriott's Theme Park Group decided that the area around Washington, D.C. would be the most promising of the three, because as the nation's capital it would be most appropriate for a park based on American history, and because it would be near their corporate headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. Over 130 potential sites in the metropolitan area were considered, and ultimately a site was chosen at the intersection of I-95 and the Patuxent Freeway in the town of Savage, Maryland, near the city of Laurel and the planned community of Columbia. Marriott acquired 850 acres of land at this site in 1971, which had previously been owned by The Rouse Company, a major landowner in the area.
As the flagship in the chain, Marriott planned a major multi-park development "on the order of the Disney amusement parks" for the Maryland site. In addition to the American-themed amusement park, the area would feature a 200-acre safari park with amphitheaters for trained animal shows and a marine mammal park with a 2,400-seat theater for performances. Later additions to the complex would include a shopping center, a campground, and a Marriott hotel.
The layout of the theme park, like its successfully built sister locations in California and Illinois, was designed by Randall Duell and Associates. Duell was a veteran theme park designer, and for the three Great America parks he set out to create his greatest design yet. With an overarching Americana theme in mind, Marriott's designers traveled across the country, observing styles and collecting artifacts to help inform an authentic atmosphere. All three were extremely similar, with the same themes in different areas, all arranged in a "Duell loop" that wound around the park. The themed areas would have included all six of those that appeared at the other parks:
Additionally, two further areas were planned because of the larger area allotted: "The Great Southwest", which would later be planned as an annex at the Gurnee park, and an unnamed area based on the antebellum South.
The plan was announced on January 26, 1972, at a press conference with then-Governor Marvin Mandel and Marriott CEO J. Willard Marriott, Jr. Construction was slated to begin in the summer of that year, after and the park was expected to be finished in time for the 1975 operating season. Local and state governments were enthusiastic about the proposal, which promised to bring over a billion dollars in revenue to the local economy and create 3,500 jobs.
Some local residents, however, were much more pessimistic about the impact of the park on Howard County. Columbia Residents Against the Marriott Proposal, a citizens' group that was abbreviated as CRAMP, was one of the earliest opponents to the park, citing concerns of unwanted traffic and tourism, as well as potential environmental impacts and the feeling that the park was being "shoved on them" by the enthusiastic state government. Other local groups, such as the Emmanuel United Methodist Church in Laurel, echoed these concerns in interviews with local reporters and at county zoning board meetings.
Marriott's plan was dependent on the creation of a new type of zone, an "entertainment center" zone, in Howard County. Hearings at the County Zoning Board began in June and continued throughout the summer of 1972. Marriott warned the board that it was looking at several other possible sites, and if their plan was rejected they would go elsewhere. Opponents argued that in addition to the problems cited by citizens' groups, the complex would create a monopoly on services and local business would not see any economic benefit. Testimony from residents of other areas where major theme parks had been built, particularly Orlando, Florida, was sought out by both sides. The plan was officially rejected on September 21, with the board stating in a unanimous 5-0 decision that it would reject any such theme park in Howard County for the same reasons.
Virginia proposal.
Despite appeals from some local residents, including a group called Citizens Happy About Marriott Park or CHAMP, the company sold the plot and moved on, searching for another location in the region. Marriott set its sights on a smaller, 540-acre plot at the intersection of Interstate 66 and Virginia State Route 234 in Manassas, Virginia. The new proposal did not include the safari park or the marine park, but the theme park was still to be larger than the other two Great Americas. The chosen site was located directly next to Manassas National Battlefield Park, which Marriott officials stated was not known to them until after it was selected. Despite some concerns about the sewage capacity of the area, the Prince William County Board of Supervisors agreed to begin the approval process in February 1973. Within days, the Six Flags chain was said to be considering a location closer to Baltimore, while Howard County residents who had previously opposed the park in Maryland offered their support to the mounting local criticism in Virginia.
After plans were announced, Marriott's team became aware of the proximity of the battlefield site and initially decided that neither park would have a significant effect on the other. David L. Brown, vice president of the Theme Park Group, stated that Marriott had "felt that if there were any effect, it would be an effect to the extent that the Battlefield Park would probably have an increase in attendance." Soon afterward, the company reached out to the National Park Service to discuss the project's potential impact. Brown wrote to Charles Marshall, director of the Park Service's Virginia State Office, to assure him that there would be no negative effect. The Park Service was already aware of the project by the time Marriott first reached out, having been surprised to see it announced in the Washington Post without being consulted.
The land which the theme park would sit on had some historical significance, according to the Park Service, which had previously been considering adding parts of the tract to their park. One area in particular, Stuart's Hill, was the headquarters of Confederate general J. E. B. Stuart during the battle, and the woods below the hill provided cover for Robert E. Lee's soldiers, making the area instrumental in the Confederate victory in the battle. The Park Service deliberately chose not to explicitly take a side on the Marriott issue, however, in part because then-president Richard Nixon's brother Donald Nixon was an executive at Marriott.
On April 3, 1973, a hearing about the project was held before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on National Parks and Recreation, spurred by strong opposition from local residents and Park Service members. In preparation for the hearing, several members of the subcommittee visited the site of the proposed construction in Manassas, while David Brown represented the Marriott Corporation before Congress. A primary concern at the hearing was Marriott's request to the county for permission to build a tower of up to in height, which would almost certainly be visible from the battlefield and disrupt the view. Brown explained that the tower in question had not yet been designed, but probably would be much less than the maximum proposed height and would be placed in a low-lying section of the park. He also definitively stated that the amusement park would not be built if the company did not receive a direct interchange from I-66 to the park, regardless of how much had already been invested by that point, to avoid the possibility of bringing high traffic to local unpaved roads.
Two days after the hearing, on April 5, the county board approved the entertainment center and light industrial zones for Marriott's proposal. The company had options open with ten property owners to purchase 513 acres, but all were set to expire on April 7, and if the zoning was not approved by that deadline Marriott would move on to some other location in the region. A majority of four board members, nicknamed by detractors as "the Four Horsemen", favored the theme park's construction. Marriott bought the land and began planning for construction, but was held up by an ongoing lawsuit over the county zoning board's procedures.
In early 1974, the county lost the suit, as it was found that the board did not give proper notice of the Marriott-related meetings with the state-mandated minimum of nineteen days in advance. All zoning decisions made by the board since the state law was passed in 1968 became subject to challenge, and one supervisor on the board stated that the decision "wiped out five months of work by Marriott".
Other issues continued to plague the project, such as the proposed interchange along I-66, which the state had not approved. The federal government asked for a detailed statement on the environmental impact of the park, which would take at least a year to complete, before plans could proceed. The prolonged fight over the plan was referred to by some as the "third battle of Manassas". By October 1974, it became clear to Marriott that the park would not be completed in time for the bicentennial, and the projected opening date was pushed back to 1977, and again weeks later to 1978. The Virginia project was placed "on the back-burner" while Marriott focused on construction at its California and Illinois parks.
The other two Great America parks successfully opened in the spring of 1976, while the Virginia site continued to remain undeveloped. Marriott finally dropped the Manassas location from consideration in 1977 after years without progress, writing off the project as a loss in an earnings statement. The issue of whether to expand the Manassas Battlefield Park was not resolved for years afterward, and the area faced similar threats of commercial development with the William Center mall in 1988 and the proposed Disney's America theme park in 1993.
Second Maryland proposal.
Marriott began to consider returning to Maryland for its third Great America park even before the Virginia project was formally cancelled. On the same day that the site in Manassas was dropped from consideration, Stephen A. West, a lawyer for the company, met with Howard County officials to discuss the possible return. He stated that while four years had been spent working on building the park in Virginia, they had always considered the area between Washington and Baltimore to be preferable. The new version of the proposal involved only 220 acres of land in Guilford, and would be built in a less rural part of the county than the earlier plan, with the hopes of avoiding some of the issues that had previously held up the project.
Both supporters and opponents of the park plan hoped that residents of Gurnee and Santa Clara, where Marriott's other two parks were now operating, would back them up in their opinions. The company offered a group of Guilford residents a trip to both locations, where they could see "firsthand... what effect they have had on the surrounding neighborhoods", while the California park's critics said that they were no less opposed to its existence now that it was operating.
The continued failure to make any headway in developing the park frustrated Marriott, which was also disappointed by the 1977 season attendance figures at its other parks. By 1978, the company said outright that it was in "no rush" to build its third park, and the following year, after two more proposals were rejected by the county zoning board and in the midst of the 1979 energy crisis reducing automobile travel, the plan was shelved and essentially cancelled.
The failure to build its largest and greatest theme park, in addition to continually disappointing profit levels from the other two parks, led Marriott to leave the amusement park business entirely in 1984. The park in Illinois was sold to the Six Flags chain, and the park in California, after demolition plans were canceled, was sold to the city of Santa Clara. The region ultimately received a major amusement park as the Largo Wildlife Preserve gradually added thrill rides and roller coasters, becoming Six Flags America.

Illingworth was the youngest of three children of Ellen Brayshaw and her husband, Herbert Edward Illingworth, an architect. He was educated in Clifton House Preparatory School, then Bradford Grammar School. He achieved a scholarship in classics to read medicine at the University of Leeds. After a number of house appointments, Illingworth was appointed as a clinical pathologist in general practice at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Before the war he was awarded a Nuffield research studentship in Oxford from the Nuffield Foundation and in 1939 a Rockefeller research fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1939. During World War II Illingworth was conscripted into the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in charge of medical divisions in several military hospitals
After the war, he took up the Rockefeller Research Fellowship and spent six months in New Haven, United States. He worked with the clinical psychologist and paediatrician Arnold Gesell at Yale University. He became interested in and studied Gessels theory on child development, known as Gesell's Maturational Theory. He studied it extensively, advocated for and taught it for the rest of his working life.
On his return to the UK he was appointed to a position as an assistant to the consultant paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital. In 1947 he took up first chair of child health at the University of Sheffield, a position he held for 28 years until his retirement.
Illingworth was considered an excellent lecturer, who could deliver three or four lectures in a day, as a broadcaster he was equally persuasive. He was considered a constructive critic. The Nuffield Professor of Child Health, Otto Herbert Wolff who presented the James Spence Medal to Illingworth, noted at the presentation that as a writer, the "quality of his writing is crisp, clear and simple of phrase and not a word to spare".
In 1947, Illingworth married fellow physician Cynthia Redhead. He travelled extensively.
Photography.
Illingworth was considered a renowned photographer and was a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and a frequent lecturer at photographic societies. When he was a student Illingworth sold photos to the press to pay his living costs. During his career he built up a large collection of microscope slides, more than 4000, which he used for teaching.
Awards and honours.
Illingworth was also awarded honorary degrees from Sheffield and Leeds. In 1982 he was awarded the Freedom of the City of Sheffield.
Bibliography.
Illingworth published some 600 articles and several books. These are some of his most notable:

Aldeia Bona

Aldeia Bona or Aldeia Apalaí, sometimes also known by its native name Karapaeukuru, is an Apalaí-Wayana village on the Eastern Paru River in the state of Pará in Brazil.
History.
Aldeia Bona was founded in 1970 by the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) in an effort to halt the socio-cultural disintegration that was taking place among the Apalaí and Wayana in Brazil. An airstrip was constructed by the Brazilian Air Force to ease access to the remote area.
Shortly after its creation, Aldeia Bona housed about 60% of the Apalaí and Wayana population of the region. The concentration of the population mostly served the interests of the Brazilian government employees stationed in the village, however, and did not adhere to the criteria the indigenous Apalaí and Wayana use for founding a village. Consequently, traditional settlement patterns, i.e. small villages of a few households spread out along a large area, reemerged after a while. Still, Aldeia Bona remains the largest Apalaí-Wayana settlement on the Paru River and continues to serve as the access point to the area.
Demographics.
In June 2016, Aldeia Bona had 267 inhabitants, of whom 157 were Apalaí, 105 were Wayana and 5 were Tiriyó.

Domestic Partnership Act 2018

The Domestic Partnership Act 2018 is an act of the Parliament of Bermuda. It provided for the creation of domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples and prohibited same-sex marriage, making the Parliament of Bermuda the first legislature to abolish same-sex marriage after it was initially legalised.
Background.
The Domestic Partnership Bill was introduced in 2017 after the Supreme Court of Bermuda ruled that homosexuals should have the same rights to marry as heterosexual couples, judicially legalising same-sex marriage. After the ruling, the Minister for Home Affairs, Walter Roban, brought the bill before the Bermuda House of Assembly designed to create a separate institution of unions for same-sex couples. The Bill passed the House with a 24–10 majority and also passed through the Senate with an 8–3 majority.
The bill then went to the Governor of Bermuda for Royal assent on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, which is customarily given to bills that have passed both houses. Governor John Rankin delayed granting consent in order to consult with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Following this, a number of international media outlets and politicians called on him to refuse to grant royal assent. A debate in the British House of Commons, led by the Labour Party's Chris Bryant (himself homosexual), called on the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to block the bill. Minister Sir Alan Duncan said that the government was "disappointed" but would not block the introduction of the act, citing the constitutional convention that the British government would not directly interfere with decisions taken by the legislatures of the Overseas Territories. The Governor then granted the Royal assent on 7 February 2018. The law went into effect on 1 June 2018.
Legal challenge.
A legal challenge against the law was filed with the Supreme Court on 16 February 2018. A second challenge against the law was announced on 3 April 2018. A hearing was held on 21 and 22 May 2018 before the Chief Justice of the court.
The court ruled on the matter on 6 June 2018. It held that “maintaining or restoring a definition of marriage that disadvantaged those who believe in same-sex marriage discriminated against them on the grounds of their creed contrary to section 12 of the Bermuda Constitution.” The court agreed to an application by the Attorney-General to stay the ruling by six weeks, to allow to government to consider an appeal. The Minister for Home Affairs has said the government intends to appeal the ruling “subject to any legal advice that we receive”.
Effect.
The Act created domestic partnerships in Bermuda which replaced same-sex marriages. The act also permitted for heterosexual couples to enter into a domestic partnership. Same-sex couples who were married before the act came into force would remain recognised as being married. Implementation was delayed owing to pending marriage licences and ceremonies due to be conducted in Bermuda or on Bermudan flagged ships. The Act came into force on 1 June 2018.

Krystsina Tsimanouskaya

Krystsina Siarheyeuna Tsimanouskaya (, Łacinka: , ; born 19 November 1996) is a Belarusian sprinter. She won a silver medal in the 100 metres at the 2017 European U23 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland; a gold medal in the 200 metres at the 2019 Summer Universiade in Naples, Italy; and a silver medal in the team event at the 2019 European Games in Minsk, Belarus.
Tsimanouskaya qualified to represent Belarus at the 2020 Summer Olympics in the women's 100 m and 200 m events. On 30 July 2021, during the Games, she accused officials from the Belarus Olympic Committee of forcing her to compete in the 4×400 metres relay race without her consent. On 1 August 2021, she was taken to Tokyo's Haneda Airport against her will, where she refused to board a flight back to Belarus. She was given police protection and granted a humanitarian visa by Poland, to which she traveled on 4 August 2021.
Early life.
Krystsina Siarheyeuna Tsimanouskaya was born in Klimavichy, a town in eastern Belarus. Though she raced for fun as a child, she joined competitive athletics late, receiving an offer from an Olympic trainer to join his academy when she was about 15 years old. Her parents were initially worried, thinking she would not achieve an athletic career; they were convinced by Tsimanouskaya and her grandmother.
International competitions.
Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
Tsimanouskaya qualified for her first Olympics in the 100 m and 200 m events, representing Belarus. On 30 July 2021 (postponed from 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic), she finished 4th in the first round heat of the 100 m event with a time of 11.47. Prior to the 200 m event, Belarus Olympic Committee (NOC RB) officials withdrew her from the competition. On 2 August, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected Tsimanouskaya's request to annul the decision of the NOC RB to stop her from participating at the Tokyo Olympics, stating that she was unable to prove her case. On 3 August, the CAS clarified that its judgement was based on the fact that Tsimanouskaya could not prove she would still attempt to compete at Tokyo while she was in the process of seeking asylum in other countries.
Repatriation incident and asylum.
On 30 July 2021, Tsimanouskaya recorded an Instagram video criticising officials from the Belarus Olympic Committee (NOC RB), saying that they had entered her in the 4 × 400 m relay race, a distance she had never contested, without her consent. On 1 August 2021, Belarusian media reported the attempt to forcibly return Tsimanouskaya to Belarus. Tsimanouskaya said to journalists that she was afraid of returning to Belarus, and she intended to claim asylum. On 2 August, she was granted a humanitarian visa to Poland.
Though most of western Europe had offered her protection, she reportedly chose to seek asylum in Poland as the country had expressly offered her the opportunity to continue competing; the IOC made contact with officials from the Polish Olympic Committee (PKOI) regarding Tsimanouskaya resuming competition. On 4 August, Tsimanouskaya flew to Warsaw Chopin Airport, where she was met by Polish officials and Belarusian expatriates. President of the IOC Thomas Bach and the Japanese foreign ministry both gave statements on 6 August describing what happened to Tsimanouskaya as "deplorable" and "unjust".

Northolt Branch Observatories

The Northolt Branch Observatories (NBO; Observatory codes: Z80, Z48 and Z37) is an astronomical observatory located in London, England. NBO collects follow-up astrometry of near-Earth asteroids and other small Solar System objects. It focuses on public outreach, sharing images, videos and information about asteroids on social media.
The two main belt asteroids 72834 Guywells and 128345 Danielbamberger are named after members of the Northolt Branch Observatories team.
History.
Northolt Branch Observatories was founded in 2015, as an extension of the London-based "Northolt Branch Astro" group of local amateur astrophotographers. It is a British-German collaboration: Data is collected on-site by observers at the telescopes in England, and then processed remotely from Germany.
Activities.
Northolt Branch Observatories is an educational outreach partner with NEOShield-2. It works closely with Asteroid Day and the PACA (Pro-Am Collaborative Astronomy) Project, with the goal to raise awareness about asteroids. In 2016 and 2017, NBO hosted the International Capture The Asteroid imaging contest, in partnership with NEOShield-2. The annual competition is targeted particularly at amateur astrophotographers, who rarely choose to image asteroids in favour of planets or deep-sky objects.
In addition to observing Near-Earth asteroids, NBO also provides supernova confirmation and long-term follow up of comets as part of PACA observing campaigns. Examples of PACA campaigns with contributions from NBO include Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, and the comets 41P/Tuttle–Giacobini–Kresák and 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková.

Piano Quartet No. 2 (Fauré)

Gabriel Fauré's Piano Quartet No. 2, in G minor, Op. 45, is one of the two chamber works he wrote for the conventional piano quartet combination of piano, violin, viola and cello. It was first performed in 1887, seven years after his first quartet.
Background.
Fauré's previous work in the genre, the Piano Quartet No. 1, Op. 15, had been favourably received at its premiere in 1880, and was among the chamber works for which he had been awarded the Prix Chartier by the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1885. Little is known about the composer's reasons for writing another. It was not commissioned, and appears to have been written because Fauré was interested in the possibilities of the piano quartet medium, and was wary of writing chamber music with no piano part. The Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that the choice of this unusual form showed the composer's desire to break new ground and be his own man. Nectoux adds that there was the advantage that the existing classical repertory contained very few top-flight piano quartets with the exception of Mozart's.
It is not certain when Fauré began work on the Second Quartet, but writers are generally agreed that it was in either 1885 or 1886, and the work was completed in time to be premiered on 22 January 1887. It was given at the Société Nationale de Musique by Guillaume Remy (violin), Louis van Waefelghem (viola), Jules Delsart (cello) and the composer (piano).
The piece was published soon after the first performance, with a dedication to the conductor Hans von Bülow.
Structure.
Fauré adopts the classical four-movement structure: an opening Allegro is followed by a scherzo, slow movement, and finale. This follows the pattern of German Romantic works such as Schumann's Piano Quartet op. 47 and Brahms's Piano Quartet op. 25.
I. Allegro molto moderato.
The first movement, which is in classical sonata form, opens with a unison string melody accompanied by relentless piano figuration. The piano takes up the theme, after which the viola introduces an expressive variant of the main theme, and the violin transforms the variant into a more relaxed second subject. The exposition ends with a modified return of the opening theme and its pulsing accompaniment. Viola and cello introduce a new theme, "molto tranquillamente", which provides a link into the central development section and returns, in its original form and then at double speed, towards the end of the section. The recapitulation begins with the first theme fortissimo, turns to G major with the viola melody, and the second subject returns on the cello and then the violin. The coda is primarily based on the opening theme but also reintroduces the "molto tranquillamente" melody now at double speed, and ends quietly in the major.
II. Allegro molto.
The C minor scherzo is the shortest of the four movements. It is in a fast 6/8 metre with a syncopated piano theme. Melodic material from the first movement – first its espressivo second subject and then the main theme – is transformed into a rondo. Cross-rhythms of 3/4 in a broad string melody give way to another smooth theme which forms a kind of "trio" interlude, although the perpetuum mobile of the main scherzo material continues behind it and carries the movement on to its conclusion.
III. Adagio non troppo.
The third movement, Adagio non troppo, is in E-flat major. The gentle undulating piano figure with which it opens was, according to Fauré, "a vague reverie" inspired by a memory of the evening bells of the village of Cadirac near his childhood home. The viola solo that follows is a rhythmically modified version of the second subject from the first movement, transformed into a gently oscillating siciliano. At the start of the middle section, the bell figure is played on the strings in a mixture of arco and pizzicato. The movement builds gradually to a fortissimo climax before the return of the bell motif leads the music back to pastoral quiet. At the beginning of the coda of the movement, the bell theme, given a more elaborate shape, given to the piano as an accompaniment to a cello melody. The music finishes quietly in the home key of E flat major. Nectoux says of this movement, "The sense of space it creates, rapt and profound within a narrow range of notes, marks it out as being truly the music of silence".
IV. Finale—allegro molto.
The critic Stephen Johnson says of this movement, "Passion and violence are again let loose … The relentless forward drive of this movement is quite unlike anything else in Fauré". The movement sets off in fast triple time, with an insistent rising string melody together with piano triplets. The second subject, derived from the "molto tranquillamente" theme of the first movement, is a vigorous theme reminiscent of a waltz. It is succeeded by a melody for viola and cello related to the trio section of the scherzo. After a development and recapitulation, there is a coda in which thematic elements from the entire quartet are glimpsed. The work ends in an emphatic G major.
Critical reputation.
The musicologist Robert Orledge comments in his 1979 biography of Fauré that the Second Piano Quartet "marks a significant advance on the First Quartet in the force of its expression, the greater rhythmic drive and complexity of its themes, and its deliberately unified conception". Orledge adds that in this work "Faure announces his full artistic maturity and the beginning of his second period". Nectoux expresses reservations about the finale, finding the second theme "rather on the heavy side" and a later section "unusually for Fauré, lacking in imagination". Aaron Copland wrote that the Second Quartet shows the composer "less carefree, less happy, more serious, more profound" than in the First. To Copland the adagio was "the crowning movement of the quartet". He described it in a 1924 essay, as "a long sigh of infinite tenderness, a long moment of quiet melancholy and nostalgic charm. Its beauty is a truly classic one if we define classicism as 'intensity on a background of calm'."

Geely MK

Geely MK is a subcompact sedan and hatchback produced by Chinese auto maker Geely. 
Overview.
Several versions were done and branded differently among Geely's former sub-brands. The Geely Jingang is still available for purchase as of 2020 where pricing ranges from 45.900 yuan to 62.900 yuan (6,490 to 8,890 USD - April 2020 exchange rate).

Styling.
The Geely MK subcompact sedan was criticized for resembling the first generation Toyota Vios especially from the side as the DLO is essentially the same as the Toyota subcompact sedan. Despite the redesigned front and rear and also having a hatchback version, it doesn't hide the fact that during the development of the Geely MK sedan, reverse engineering was involved using the Toyota Vios.
2016 facelift.
The last facelift was conducted in late 2015 for the 2016 model year, changing the front and rear views and clarifying the updated model name and branding simply as the Geely Jingang under the Geely brand. 
Geely Englon SC6-RV.
The Geely Englon SC6-RV debuted as a concept at the 2010 Beijing Auto Show and started production in 2012. The Englon SC6-RV is based on the post-facelift Geely Golden Eagle Cross (Jinying cross), which are both crossover hatchback versions of the Geely MK which was also known as the Geely Jinying.

1973 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election

The 1973 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election was held on March 6, 1973, to elect the United States Representative from Alaska's at-large congressional district. Incumbent Democratic Representative Nick Begich had won reelection in 1972, but had gone missing shortly before the election. 
Begich's seat was declared vacant by a jury and a special election was ordered by Governor William A. Egan. Don Young, who had lost to Begich in 1972, won the Republican nomination without opposition while Emil Notti defeated Chancy Croft and Pegge Begich for the Democratic nomination. In the general election Young defeated Notti.
Background.
Representative Nick Begich disappeared while traveling on an airplane with House Majority Leader Hale Boggs on October 16, 1972, and was never found. However, despite his disappearance Begich defeated Don Young in the House of Representatives election. On November 24, the United States Air Force announced that it would suspend the air search for Begich and Boggs after no traces of the missing plane had been found after 3,600 hours of searching had covered 325,000 square miles.
Following his defeat Young asked Governor William A. Egan to call a special legislative session to speed up the process of the special election to fill Begich's vacant seat. According to Alaskan law a special election must be called by the governor within sixty to ninety days after a vacancy is declared. Three petitions calling for a presumptive death hearing for Begich were filed in the Juneau District Court, and was later transferred to Anchorage. On December 12, the six-member jury deliberated for twenty minutes before ruling that Begich and two other people onboard the plane were presumably dead.
On December 29, Governor Egan announced that the special election would be held on March 6, 1973.
Democratic nomination.
On November 7, 1972, after voting in the 1972 election, Pegge Begich, the wife of Nick Begich, stated that she was open to running in a special election to fill her husband's vacant seat. Peggy later announced that she would seek the Democratic nomination "if and when a vacancy occurs". On December 20, she stated that she would spend $40,000 to $60,000 on the campaign.
The Anchorage Daily News released a poll of 22 of the 29 members of the Democratic State Central Committee. Eleven members supported state Senator Chancy Croft, eight were undecided, and three supported Pegge Begich. On December 7, Croft announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the special election. On January 5, 1973, Emil Notti, chairman of the Alaska Democratic Party, announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the special election.
Fifty-one Democrats filed a lawsuit on December 5, to prevent the Democratic State Central Committee from choosing the special election candidate at a meeting. On December 7, Judge Edmond W. Burke granted a preliminary injunction while Notti filed an appeal. On December 28, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled against Notti's appeal which forced the Democratic Party to select its candidate at a convention. The court ruled that a committee meeting to select the candidate would be a violation of the principle of one man, one vote. Another attempt was made to appeal the ruling prohibiting the selection of a candidate at a committee meeting, but the courts ruled in favor of the 51 Democrats again on January 10, 1973.
On January 14, 1973, the Democratic state convention was held at the Gold Rush Hotel in Anchorage, Alaska. Notti won on the third ballot with 108.5 delegate votes against Croft's 90.4 votes. On January 17, Notti selected Begich to serve as the chairwoman of his campaign. Following the convention Democratic National committeeman Cliff Warren announced that he would drop his appeal to the ruling baring a committee meeting to select the party's special election candidate.
Republican nomination.
Former Governor Keith Harvey Miller, Anchorage Mayor George M. Sullivan, former Commissioner of Natural Resources Tom Kelley, and state senators Clifford Groh and Lowell Thomas Jr., who had been speculated as possible candidates for the Republican nomination in the special election, announced that they would support Don Young for the Republican nomination. However, Sullivan and Groh stated that they would be interested in running if Young were to withdraw.
On December 2, 1972, the Alaska Republican Central Committee, with eight committee members present and eight committee members voting by proxy, voted unanimously to give Young the Republican nomination for the special election.
On December 13, the Republican Party filed a lawsuit to receive clarification on Judge Edmond W. Burke's ruling that the Democratic candidate for the special election could only be nominated at a convention and not by the Democratic Central Committee. The Alaskan government filed a motion to dismiss the Republican lawsuit stating that there was no conflict for the court to resolve, and on December 29, Judge Everett W. Hepp dismissed the lawsuit. Jack Coghill, the chairman of the Alaska Republican Party, stated that as the lawsuit was dismissed that the Republicans would not need to hold a convention to select their special election candidate as their method of selection for Young was not contested.
General election.
On January 9, 1973, Don Young filed to run in the special election, and stated that environmental issues and how Alaska utilizes its natural resources would be the major issues during the campaign. Young also stated that he would not resign from the state senate, but he would limit campaigning to the weekends when the state legislature was not in session. Jack Coghill served as the chairman of Young's campaign.
Young stated that he was promised seats on the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries and the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs by the Republican leadership. Young showed a telegram signed by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford showing the promise. Emil Notti stated that Speaker of the House Carl Albert and House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill promised him a seat on the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.
On March 6, Young narrowly defeated Notti by 2,000 votes with 35,044 (51.41%) to 33,123 (48.59%) votes. Young was inaugurated into the House of Representatives on March 14. He would continue to be reelected and became the longest serving Republican member of the House of Representatives in 2013.

Stamped from the Beginning

Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America is a non-fiction book about race in the United States by Ibram X. Kendi, published April 12, 2016 by PublicAffairs. The book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.
The book also has two "remixes" for children, "Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You" and "Stamped (For Kids): Racism, Antiracism, and You."
Reception.
"Stamped from the Beginning" received a starred review from Kirkus, as well as the following accolades:
"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You".
Kendi wrote "Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You" with Jason Reynolds, "remixing" "Stamped from the Beginning" for a younger audience. The book was published March 10, 2020 by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.
Origins.
"Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You" is adapted from "Stamped: From the Beginning", originally written by Kendi. The first book, published in 2016, focuses on historical figures. However, "Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You" follows a chronological format. Kendi reached out to Reynolds to collaborate on a chronological version after seeing success with his first book. Reynolds first declined Kendi's proposal, adamant that he was a fiction writer. It took a writing style that made "Stamped" "not a history book" to get Reynolds on board with the idea.
Structure.
Kendi and Reynolds insist throughout the book that "it is not a history book" and writes in a casual, easy-to-understand manner, using slang and pop culture references to cater to the younger audience. There are five sections split by time periods: 1415–1728, 1743–1826, 1826–1879, 1868–1963, and 1963-today. The chapters vary in length and there are 28 in total. In these chapters, Kendi and Reynolds focus on important, often overlooked figures and events to illustrate the development of racist ideas throughout the history of the United States. Throughout the book, Kendi and Reynolds return to the themes of racists, assimilationists, and antiracists, and the book ends by encouraging readers to take what they have learned from the book and to become antiracist. 
Reception.
"Stamped" is a New York Times Bestseller and received numerous positive reviews, including starred reviews from Booklist and Kirkus. Kirkus also named it one of the best books of 2020.
The print book has received the following accolades:
The audiobook has received the following accolades:
Despite the above, in 2020, "Stamped" landed the second position on the American Library Association's list of the most commonly banned and challenged books in the United States. The book was banned, challenged, and/or restricted "because of author’s public statements, and because of claims that the book contains 'selective storytelling incidents' and does not encompass racism against all people."
"Stamped (For Kids): Racism, Antiracism, and You".
"Stamped (For Kids): Racism, Antiracism, and You," published May 11, 2021 by Little, Brown Young Readers. The book was written by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds, illustrated by Rachelle Baker, and adapted by Sonja Cherry-Paul.
"Stamped (for Kids)" is a "New York Times" Bestseller and received a starred review from Kirkus.

Yesterday (2019 film)

Yesterday is a 2019 musical romantic comedy film directed by Danny Boyle and screenplay by Richard Curtis, based on a story by Jack Barth. Himesh Patel stars as struggling musician Jack Malik, who suddenly finds himself the only person who has ever heard of the Beatles and becomes famous after reintroducing their songs to the world. The film also stars Lily James, Joel Fry, Ed Sheeran, and Kate McKinnon. It gets its title from the Beatles song of the same name.
"Yesterday" was announced in March 2018. Filming began the following month around England, particularly Norfolk and Halesworth in Suffolk. Photography also took place at Wembley Stadium, the Principality Stadium, and in Los Angeles. The filmmakers paid $10 million for the rights to use the Beatles' music; although none of the band members was involved, Boyle received approval for the project from them or their families.
"Yesterday" had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in May 2019, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States in June 2019, by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $153 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise, performances, and musical sequences, but criticism for its familiarity and not exploring the concept further.
Plot.
Jack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter from Lowestoft who plays gigs to tiny crowds. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton encourages him not to give up on his dreams. During a twelve-second global power outage, Jack is hit by a bus. After recovering, he sings the Beatles song "Yesterday" for his friends. However, he discovers that they have never heard of the Beatles, and that he is now in an alternative reality where the band never formed. Jack begins performing Beatles songs, passing them off as his own.
Ellie has Jack record a demo with Gavin, a local music producer. Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop star Ed Sheeran to play as his opening act in Moscow. Ellie declines to join him, saying she must work at her day job as a schoolteacher, so Jack's roadie friend Rocky travels with him instead. After the gig, Sheeran challenges Jack to a songwriting duel: after Jack plays "The Long and Winding Road," Sheeran graciously accepts defeat. In Los Angeles, Sheeran's ruthless manager Debra Hammer signs Jack to her label and engineers his rise to global fame.
At Jack's going-away party before his permanent move to L.A., Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him. Jack starts recording an album at EastWest Studios, but cannot remember the lyrics for "Eleanor Rigby." Hoping to trigger memories, Jack goes to the Beatles' hometown of Liverpool, visiting landmarks such as Strawberry Field, Penny Lane, and the grave of Eleanor Rigby. Ellie joins him in Liverpool, and they spend a drunken evening and kiss, but Ellie tells Jack she is not interested in a one-night stand. The following morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie to the train station. She congratulates Jack but tells him she cannot be a part of his celebrity life. Jack returns to Los Angeles, heartbroken and desperate to have a normal life again, while Ellie begins dating Gavin.
The record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album. However, they reject Jack's title ideas, named from Beatles albums, and name it "One Man Only", pushing his talent. Jack persuades them to launch the album with a rooftop concert in Gorleston-on-Sea. Two people who also were transferred to the alternative reality approach Jack backstage. They reveal that they know Jack didn't write the songs, but thank him, having feared the Beatles' music was gone forever. They give him the address of John Lennon, who, having never formed the Beatles in this reality, has survived into old age, out of the public spotlight. John, who has lived a happy life with his wife, advises Jack to pursue the one he loves and always tell the truth.
Jack calls in a favour from Sheeran, who arranges for him to perform at Wembley Stadium. Jack confesses to the crowd that he plagiarized the music, loves Ellie, and has Rocky upload the songs for free to the Internet, sabotaging the record release and enraging Debra. Jack and Ellie marry and start a family, and Jack gives up stardom to become a music teacher.
Cast.
In addition, James Corden and Michael Kiwanuka appear as themselves, and Robert Carlyle makes an uncredited appearance as John Lennon.
Production.
Writing.
"Yesterday" began as a 2012 screenplay, "Cover Version," by Jack Barth. Barth had been struggling to sell screenplays for decades, and conceived the story when it occurred to him that "if "Star Wars" hadn't been made and I just came up with the idea for "Star Wars", I bet I wouldn't be able to sell it". In Barth's script, a "meditation on professional disappointment", Jack did not find success with the Beatles songs.
An early version of the screenplay was worked on by Mackenzie Crook, who intended to direct; Crook left to work on his television series "Detectorists." The script was passed to the production company Working Title. Years later, while working on clearance rights for the Beatles songs, a Working Title producer mentioned the screenplay to filmmaker Richard Curtis, who decided to buy it and rewrite it as a romantic comedy. On Curtis's insistence, the screenplay is credited to Curtis, and the story credited to Curtis and Barth.
Curtis told interviewers he did not read Barth's script, preferring to use the premise to write his own version. He told "Den of Geek": "I sometimes found when I worked with original material that it doesn't come from the heart. So I tried to write a whole film that meant something to me, rather than having too much extra information." However, according to Barth, the final film includes many elements of his screenplay, including John Lennon as a wizened fisherman and a joke about "Harry Potter". Curtis credited the "Harry" "Potter" joke to a suggestion from Sarah Silverman, who is thanked in the credits.
Barth complained that Curtis had taken sole credit for the screenplay and damaged him financially. He felt that Curtis had changed the story to make Jack a successful songwriter as a reflection of Curtis's own career: "[Curtis] met Rowan Atkinson at Oxford, he came out of Oxford and immediately rode Rowan Atkinson to huge success in his early twenties. He's never been knocked out, as far as I know. Why "wouldn't" [Jack] become the most successful songwriter in the world?"
Casting.
In March 2018, it was announced that Curtis and director Danny Boyle were working on a musical comedy set in the 1960s or 1970s following "a struggling musician who thinks he's the only person who can remember the Beatles", with Himesh Patel cast in the lead role. Boyle was convinced Patel was the right choice after listening to him perform the Beatles songs "Yesterday" and "Back in the U.S.S.R." during auditions. Boyle felt that Patel's voice had soul. Patel sang and performed guitar and piano himself.
Later in March 2018, Lily James and Kate McKinnon joined the cast. Boyle informed the surviving members and widows of the Beatles about the film and received a reply he described as "lovely" from Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. In April 2018, it was revealed that Ed Sheeran had joined the cast. Sheeran's role was originally intended for Coldplay singer Chris Martin, who turned it down. Sheeran said Harry Styles was also asked, which Boyle denied. Ana de Armas and Lamorne Morris joined later in April, followed by Sophia Di Martino, Joel Fry and Harry Michell in May.
Filming.
Filming began on 21 April 2018, with production in the United Kingdom starting on 26 April 2018, with scenes filmed across East Anglia in Cantley, Halesworth, Dunwich, Shingle Street, Latitude Festival and Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. A casting call was issued for extras in overnight scenes shot immediately after Sheeran's four consecutive concerts at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales in May 2018. A further 5,000 extras appeared in scenes at Gorleston-on-Sea Beach in Norfolk in June 2018. Wembley Stadium was also used to film a concert scene. Filming also took place in Liverpool, making use of Penny Lane, Liverpool John Lennon Airport, Lime Street Station and the Queensway Tunnel.
In February 2019, it was announced that the title of the film was "Yesterday". It is estimated to have cost around $10 million to get the rights for the Beatles' songs to be featured in the film, with the rights to their music being held by Apple Records and Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Scenes with de Armas, who played another love interest for Jack, were cut as test audiences felt it made Jack less sympathetic.
Release.
"Yesterday" was initially set for a September 2019 release, but was moved up to 28 June 2019, largely as a result of a copyright suit filed by Paul McCartney. The rights to some of the earlier Beatles songs used in the film would revert to McCartney in the autumn of 2019, and Sony Music wanted to get ahead of it.
The first official trailer of the film was released on 12 February 2019. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on 4 May 2019. A local screening of the film took place at the Gorleston Palace cinema on 21 June 2019. Universal spent $75.4 million promoting the film worldwide.
Reception.
Box office.
"Yesterday" grossed $73.3million in the United States and Canada, and $80.4million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $153.7million, against a production budget of $26million. This includes over () grossed in the United Kingdom.
In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $10–15 million from 2,603 theatres in its opening weekend. The film made $6.1 million on its first day, including $1.25 million from Thursday night previews. It ended up slightly exceeding projections and debuting to $17 million, finishing third behind "Toy Story 4" and "Annabelle Comes Home". In its second weekend the film made $10.7 million, again finishing in third (behind "" and "Toy Story 4"), then grossed $6.8 million in its third weekend, falling to fifth.
The film opened to , including $2.8 million in the United Kingdom (where it finished second behind "Toy Story 4") and $2.5 million in Australia. "Deadline Hollywood" calculated the net profit of the film to be $45million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. However, Universal officially took an $87.8 million loss on the film, which "Deadline" deduced would eventually result in a $26.5 million profit after TV and video sales were taken into account.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 356 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Yesterday" may fall short of fab, but the end result is still a sweetly charming fantasy with an intriguing—albeit somewhat under-explored—premise." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 87% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.
Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" gave the film four out of five stars, writing "although this film can be a bit hokey and uncertain on narrative development, the puppyish zest and fun summoned up by Curtis and Boyle carry it along." Robbie Collin also responded positively in his review for "The Daily Telegraph", saying the film "rallies in style for a beautifully judged and surprisingly moving finale, which owes a lot to Patel and James's chemistry." Owen Gleiberman of "Variety", meanwhile, was less enthusiastic, claiming the film had little soul and calling it a "rom-com wallpapered with the Beatles' greatness." Laura Snapes of "The Guardian" called "Yesterday" "the latest jukebox movie to put its women on mute."
Beatles' reactions.
Paul McCartney revealed on an episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" that he and his wife Nancy Shevell snuck into a cinema in The Hamptons to see the film and "loved it". Boyle also sent copies of the completed film to Ringo Starr and his wife Barbara, as well as George Harrison's widow Olivia, and received "lovely messages" from both parties. John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, also approved of the film's depiction of her husband.
Comparisons.
As remarked upon in the media, a number of other works have had a similar premise or theme involving parallel worlds or time travel. These include the 2011 French graphic novel "Yesterday" by David Blot and Jérémie Royer (the title, again, alluding to the Beatles song), the 2010-12 Japanese manga by Tetsuo Fujii and Kaiji Kawaguchi, the 1990s British sitcom "Goodnight Sweetheart", the 2006 French film "Jean-Philippe", and Nick Milligan's 2013 novel "Enormity". Danny Boyle has said he was not aware of earlier works with similar premises when he read the script, but had become aware of a French film and British sitcom with a similar premise.
The film was also compared to "Blinded by the Light" (2019), a British comedy-drama produced around the same time. This film concerns an aspiring British Asian writer inspired by the songs of Bruce Springsteen.

 is a micro-asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Aten group, approximately in diameter. It was first observed on 26 February 2018, by astronomers of the Mount Lemmon Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona, five days prior to its sub-lunar close encounter with Earth at less than 0.3 lunar distance.
Orbit and classification.
 belongs to the Aten group of asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Contrary to the much larger Apollos, Atens have a semi-major axis of less than 1 AU, that is, a period less than a year (Earth).
Based on an observation arc of less than 2 days, it orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.82–1.15 AU once every 12 months (358 days; semi-major axis of 0.986 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Mount Lemmon with its first observation.
Close encounters.
2018 flyby.
On 2 March 2018, at 05:54 UT, this object passed Earth at a nominal distance of which corresponds to a distance of . The object also approached the Moon at a similar distance of the day before. It was the 18th known asteroid to flyby Earth within 1 lunar distance (LD) since the start of 2018 and 6th closest. Five days earlier, a similar object, , came within 175,000 miles (284,000 km). However, the two encounters were unrelated and neither of them represent any hazard to the Earth "(also see )".
MOID and projections.
 has a notably low minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , or 0.06 LD. The asteroid's next encounter with Earth will be on 26 February 2019 at a much larger distance of . It closest future approach is predicted to occur on 28 February 2064, then at a nominal distance of .
Physical characteristics.
Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures between 6 and 12 meters in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 28.4, and an assumed albedo between 0.057 and 0.20, which represent typical values for carbonaceous and stony asteroids, respectively. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of this object has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

Maxus T60

The Maxus T60 is a mid-size pickup truck manufactured by SAIC Motor under the Maxus brand since November 2016. It is the first pick-up truck from SAIC built for the global market and it is the first Chinese-manufactured utility pick-up truck to score 5 stars on the ANCAP Safety Rating.
In April 2019, its successor, the Maxus T70, was unveiled at the 2019 Auto Shanghai. The vehicle was not the first pickup produced by the company, since SAIC Motor had previously produced pickups based on the Shanghai SH760, but with a over 20 years difference in production, the SH760 pickups are not a real predecessor to the T60 trucks.
History.
The original 2.8L T60 debuted at the 2016 Guangzhou International Motor Show in Guangzhou, China. The T60 is the first pickup from SAIC and it is the first Chinese-built pickup truck with 6 airbags. Early test models were equipped with a "LFB479Q" 1.8L petrol engine coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission, as stated by SAIC to the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The T60 was one of the first SAIC vehicles to be sold under the consumer-to-business (C2B) model, with the customer having the possibility to fully customize the truck on the Maxus website before buying it.
On June 12, 2017, the first batch of 300 T60 pickups were shipped to Chile in batches. Since the T60 was exported to Chile in May, as of November 2017, there have been more than 1,200 orders.
On August 1, 2017 The T60 was selected by the Chinese Army to be the parade command support vehicle for the 90th anniversary of the founding of the PLA.
On September 25, 2017, the T60 was officially launched in Australia. In October 2017, the T60 scored the highest score in the history of Chinese automobiles in ANCAP collision test, and won the ANCAP five-star safety rating, becoming the first Chinese pickup to receive the title.
In January 2018, the T60 became the law enforcement vehicle for Linyi, Shandong.
On May 28, 2018, it was reported by British media that UK models will be powered by a new 2.0 diesel engine designed in conjunction with VM Motori.
On December 5, 2018, the T60 was officially delivered to the F1 (Formula One) race party at the Shanghai International Circuit, and will provide services for the 1000th F1 race in 2019.
On December 20, 2019, the T60 ranked first in a PLA truck competition and won a large purchase order for thousands of military pickups.
Due to government emission regulations, all T60 models from 2020 that are on sale in China are powered by the new 2.0 Euro 6 SAIC-GM Phi diesel engine, and are called "Pioneer edition".
Pricing for the T60 in China is 91,800 to 161,800 yuan (US$14,468 to US$25,500) for rear wheel drive models and 115,800 to 199,800 yuan (18,250 to US$31,488) for four wheel drive models.
Specifications.
The original Maxus T60 is powered by a 2.8 liters R series "SC28R" engine based on a VM Motori "RA 428" engine licence. It is an I4 intercooled, variable-geometry turbocharged diesel engine manufactured by SDEC. In November 2017, two new engine options were added; a 2.0 litre SAIC-GM MGE 20L4E Inline 4 turbocharged engine producing 224 horsepower, with 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic transmission and an older 2.4 litre Mitsubishi Sirius-family SAIC 4G69S4N Inline 4 naturally aspirated petrol engine, producing 136 horsepower with a 5 speed Aisin manual gearbox.

Chuniophoeniceae

Chuniophoeniceae is a tribe of palms in subfamily Coryphoideae of plant family Arecaceae. The four genera within the tribe are morphologically dissimilar and do not have overlapping distributions. Three of the genera are monotypic, while the fourth genus ("Chuniophoenix") has three species.
Description.
Outwardly, the palms in the four genera of Chuniophoeniceae appear quite different. "Chuniophoenix" are small palms from the forest understory with clustered stems; "Kerriodoxa" is a squat, single-stemmed rainforest palm; "Nannorrhops" is a sprawling desert palm with branching stems; and "Tahina" is a massive solitary palm from exposed limestone outcrops. They differ significantly in their flowering strategies, too. "Chuniophoenix" species flower regularly throughout their lives (pleonanthic) and produce hermaphroditic flowers (rarely single gender); "Kerriodoxa" are also pleonanthic, but are always dioecious; "Nannorrhops" stems die after flowering (hapaxanthic), though the much-branched plant survives; "Tahina" produces a massive terminal inflorescence and dies after fruiting. All Chuniophoeniceae have palmate leaves with induplicate folds and tubular bracts partially enclosing the flowers.
Taxonomy.
Chuniophoeniceae is one of eight tribes in subfamily Coryphoideae. The tribe is monophyletic and closely related to tribes Caryoteae, Corypheae and Borasseae, forming the syncarpous clade. In a previous classification, prior to the discovery of "Tahina", the three other genera were placed in tribe Corypheae, subtribe Coryphinae, together with the genus "Corypha". Coincidentally, "Corypha" and "Tahina" both share the strategy of producing a massive display of flowers only once before dying.
The four genera have widely disjunct distributions. "Chuniophoenix" (3 spp.) is found in southern China and Vietnam; "Kerriodoxa" (1 sp., "K. elegans") is restricted to peninsular Thailand; "Nannorrhops" (1 sp., "N. ritchiana") is found in parts of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the southeastern Arabian Peninsula; while "Tahina" (1 sp., "T. spectabilis") is endemic to a small area of northwestern Madagascar.

Franco-German University

The Franco-German University (FGU, , ) is an international organisation of universities from Germany and France with the purpose of facilitating international cooperation in higher education. The FGU is not a university in its own right, but rather enables students to study at multiple universities in both countries in a Franco-German course of study, leading to a double degree.
History and organisation.
In a first attempt at higher education cooperation, a "Franco-German College for Higher Education" (, ) had existed since 1988. That organisation had similar goals, working to promote international academic cooperation and student exchanges.
At the September 1997 Franco-German Summit in Weimar, the French and German governments concluded the Weimar Agreement, deciding to establish the Franco-German University with the intention of international cooperation. The agreement came into effect two years later when the Franco-German University was formally founded.
The organisation is headed in day-to-day administration by a President and a Vice President, of whom one is always French and one is German; and a secretarial office in Saarbrücken. A primary governing body is the University Council, composed of 22 politicians, scientists, industry representatives and other experts from both countries. All full member institutions of the FGU are directly represented in the Assembly of Member Universities, gathering for yearly meetings.
Funding for the FGU is provided by the French and German governments equally, and has steadily been increased since the institution's early days.
Activity.
The university primarily enables double degrees at French and German universities, international doctorates, and cooperative research projects; supporting mobility and communication between the countries.
In 2016 the Franco-German University was responsible for more than 6,000 students in 177 courses of study. Most students come from either France or Germany, but some foreign students participate as well. Out of the FGU's 185 member or partner universities and colleges (including "grandes écoles" and "Fachhochschulen" in addition to traditional universities), 22 partner institutions are located in third countries — predominantly in Europe, but also Canada, Japan and Morocco.
The university has been called "a remarkable umbrella organization enabling numerous French and German higher education institutions to successfully cooperate in all research areas" by the director of the Franco-German Institute Frank Baasner, and its contribution to the history of Franco-German cooperation recognised.

Peter Dawson (trade unionist)

Joseph Peter Dawson (18 March 1940 – 19 January 2005) was a Welsh trade union leader.
Born in Swansea, Dawson attended University College Swansea and qualified as a schoolteacher. From 1962 until 1964, he was a vice-president of the National Union of Students. After university, he found work at Chiswick Grammar School, but devoted much of his time to the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and in 1965 began working full-time for the union.
After working as a field officer for the NUT for four years, Dawson moved to become assistant secretary of the Association of Teachers in Technical Institutions (ATTI). In this role, he supported lecturers at the Guildford School of Art who had been sacked for objecting to it amalgamating with another college, and Jennifer Muscutt, who had been sacked from Garretts Green Technical College for taking part in a sexually-explicit educational film before she started working at the institution. Both cases were resolved successfully, and the ATTI grew rapidly, with Dawson moving to become its negotiating secretary in 1974.
The ATTI took part in a merger which formed the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), and in 1979 Dawson was appointed as general secretary of the new union. During the decade he led the union, it faced difficulties as further education budgets were cut.
In 1989, a new law required all union general secretaries to be elected. Dawson accordingly stood for his post, but lost the election to Geoff Woolf. Instead, Dawson returned to working as the union's assistant secretary, while devoting much of his time to international affairs, working part-time for the European Trade Union Committee for Education and then Education International.
Dawson retired in 1998, but continued working as a consultant to Education International, also serving as a Labour Party councillor on Lewisham London Borough Council.

John and Julia Hevener House

The John and Julia Hevener House is a single-family home located at 1444 West Genesee in Lapeer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
History.
John Hevener was born in 1842. In the mid-1860s, he became a business partner of Enoch J. White, one of Lapeer's founding settlers. The two men founded and ran a
highly successful general store. Henever served at various times as Mayor of Lapeer, Superintendent of the County Poor, Board of Education Secretary, and
Trustee of School District #2. John and Julia Hevener purchased this lot from Enoch White in 1884, and constructed this house. They lived in the house for nearly 30 years. In the 20th century, the house was converted into doctor's offices and then into apartments. It was later restored as a single family dwelling.
Description.
The Hevener House is one of the most elaborate Queen Anne-styled residences in Lapeer, distinguished by the ornateness, complexity and delicacy of its Queen Anne-inspired detailing. It is a two-and-one-half-story house with irregular massing, varied exterior wood surface
treatments, and a large wrap-around porch with decorative supports. The house sits on a stone foundation and is covered with clapboard, and shingling and vergeboards in the main gables, gable corners, and gabled pediments of the porch roof. There is a bay window on one east facade and small pointed attic windows in the gable ends.

Theme from Sparta F.C.

"Theme from Sparta F.C." is a song by British post-punk band the Fall, written by Mark E. Smith with band members Ben Pritchard and Jim Watts.
Album version.
After an early version was recorded for a John Peel Radio 1 session, the song was recorded at the Gracielands Studio in Rochdale. Produced by Grant "Showbiz" Cunliffe and Mark E. Smith, it was first released on the band's 2003 UK album "The Real New Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click)". Band personnel were Mark E. Smith (vocals), Ben Pritchard (guitar, vocals), Jim Watts (bass, guitar, computers), Dave Milner (drums, vocals, keyboards) and Elena Poulou (keyboards, vocals). 
Single version.
A different version of the song was recorded by the band in early 2004, after Simon Archer replaced Watts. This version, produced by Smith and Archer and known as "Theme from Sparta F.C. #2", was issued as a single in July 2004, and reached number 66 on the UK singles chart. The 2004 recording was also included on the US issue of "The Real New Fall LP". It was voted number one in John Peel's 2004 "Festive Fifty".
From 2005 until 2009, the song was used as theme music to the "Final Score" section of BBC television's Saturday afternoon sports coverage, and as a result Smith was invited on one occasion to read the football scores.
Lyrics.
The song lyrics seem to be written from the perspective of a Greek football fan, with references to rivalries with Galatasaray and Chelsea F.C.. Smith said:Elena came up with some great words and I added some words I thought were like the Greek football fans' attitude, you know. I do know quite a few Greek football fans, and their attitude to soccer is completely different to Britain. Sort of cobbled it all together, put a Greek motif on the guitar and that was it.

According to the ancient Korean record of Samguk Sagi, Choi Ri () was the king of Nakrang Kingdom. However, the kingdom's sovereignty is disputed along with Choi Ri's title. Many Korean scholars view Nakrang as an independent kingdom and Choi Ri as Nakrang's king, but Chinese and Japanese scholars usually claim that the name Nakrang referred to Lelang Commandery and Choi Ri was a Chinese governor of the commandery.
Outline.
When Hodong, a child of Daemusin of Goguryeo, the third king of Goguryeo went Okjeo for hunting, he met Choi Ri who was the king of Nakrang Kingdom and decided to welcome his daughter Princess of Nakrang as a wife of Hodong. Daemusin of Goguryeo was planning to attack Nakrang Kingdom, and asked Hodong to destroy the drum and Oliphant that automatically notify people when enemy attack the country. Hodong send a messenger and ask Princess of Nakrang to destroy the drum and Oliphant.
For Hodong, Princess of Nakrang destroyed the drum and Oliphant by a sword, after that Goguryeo attacked Nakrang Kingdom. Choi Ri could not be prepared for that attack because the drum and Oliphant were destroyed and he could not know Goguryeo’s invasion. He only knew that the drums and Oliphant were destroyed after Goguryeo’s aggression, but there’s nothing to do but surrender to Goguryeo. At that time, Choi Ri killed Princess of Nakrang who destroyed the drum and Oliphant.

Charles Palmer House

The Charles Palmer House is a single-family home located at 240 North Main Street in Imlay City, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
History.
Charles Palmer was born in Saratoga County, New York in 1831. He began working on the railroad as a civil engineer by age 17, and in 1851 was working in Toledo, Ohio. He moved to Wisconsin in 1853, and then to Michigan in 1856, where he was chief engineer and superintendent of construction for the Port Huron and Lake Michigan Railroad. Drawn by the land, he platted out the settlement that was to become Imlay City. In 1870, he started construction of the Bancroft House, a railroad hotel in Imlay City, and over the next few years he opened a bank, worked as a school board member, and served as a village trustee.
Early in the city's history, Palmer constructed a house on this lot. In 1890, Palmer moved the original house backwards on the lot and built this house for his family. Palmer lived in the house until his death in 1916.
Description.
The Charles Palmer House is a two-story Queen Anne house framed and sheathed in wood. It is laden with wood detailing, including a variety of window shapes and sizes, a complex roofline of hipped and gabled shapes, and a rich overlay of shingled, carved, incised, turned, and jig-sawed wood ornamentation. The house is asymmetrical, with the front facade continuing a recessed central bay capped with a pediment and flanked by a projecting bay capped by the end of a gabled roof, and a further recessed bay that is actually a three-story tower topped with a hipped roof and finial.
The house is clad with narrow clapboard siding, with a bandcourse of fishscale shingles. Carved floral swags are over the first floor windows, and there are turned
details on the first and second story porches. The tower has squared shingles and cornice line brackets at the top floor level.

Background.
With rowing officials from around the world coming to the regatta, the International Rowing Federation (FISA) held an ordinary congress on 30 August 1950 in Milan. It was at that congress that it was decided that women's rowing would be trialled. The first test event over the shorter agreed 1,000 m distance was run at the 1951 European Rowing Championships in Mâcon a day prior to the men's competition starting.

The 1951 European Rowing Championships were rowing championships held on the Mâcon regatta course on the Saône in Mâcon, France. Men competed in all seven Olympic boat classes (M1x, M2x, M2-, M2+, M4-, M4+, M8+). The regatta is notable as the first test event for international women's rowing organised by the International Rowing Federation (FISA), with four countries competing in four boat classes (W1x, W2x, W4+, W8+) over the shorter race distance of 1,000 m (men competed over 2,000 m). The purpose of the test event was to see whether women's rowing should formally become part of the FISA-organised European Rowing Championships.
Women's test event.
The French rowing association (Fédération Française de Sociétés d’Aviron) organised the test event. Four countries sent teams; France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The four boat classes competed in were the single scull (W1x), double scull (W2x), coxed four (W4+), and eight (W8+). There were three boats nominated for the double scull, but all countries had boats compete in the other boat classes. Great Britain came third in all four races.
The women would have their second test event in Amsterdam in 1952. There were no European Rowing Championships that year as the Olympic Games were held in Helsinki, and whenever the Olympic Games were held in Europe the European Rowing Championships would be skipped. The same four countries competed in Amsterdam in the same four boat classes.

Education.
Webb completed a Bachelors in Psychology at the University of Sydney in 1988. She earned her PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1993.
Research.
Webb joined the University of Nottingham in 1995. In 1999 she moved to the University of Stirling. In 2001 she published the book "Biorobotics - Methods and Applications" with Thomas Consi.
She moved back to the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in May 2003. In 2004 she contributed to the publication "Foresight Cognitive Systems Project Research Review, Robotics and Cognition".
Webb is interested in understanding how perceptual systems control of behaviour, which she studies by building computational and robotic models. To understand this she studies the behaviour of insects, whose smaller nervous systems are simpler than humans. Her group use computational modelling to understand the behaviour at a neural level. They test their models in agent and robot systems. She believes the behaviours, sensors and small brains of insects should be inspiration for efficient processing algorithms for sensorimotor control. Her group research the navigation of ants, learning abilities of drosophila and movement of crickets. She uses insect inspired robotics as an approach to control system design.
She was appointed to a Professor of Biorobotics in 2010. Her inaugural lecture discussed how biological systems are examples of the kind of machines roboticists want to build. That year, she delivered the University of Edinburgh Christmas Lecture.
Webb is interested in how ants, with brains small enough to fit on a pin head, can manage to navigate back to their homes. In 2017 she demonstrated how ants use the position of the sun to walk backwards. The discovery attracted media attention and in an interview Webb said that they "could be taking images and comparing them continuously, but are able to mentally rotate the views to adjust to backward walking".

Stjarnan women's basketball

The Stjarnan women's basketball team, commonly known as Stjarnan, is the women's basketball department of Ungmennafélagið Stjarnan, based in the town of Garðabær, Iceland.
History.
In 2009, disgruntled Ármann players, unhappy with poor training facilities and lack of practice time, contacted Stjarnan and inquired if the board would be interested in starting a women's team. The board responded positively and in the end the entire Ármann team transferred over.
Stjarnan finished first in the second-tier 1. deild kvenna in 2015 and defeated Njarðvík in the playoffs to win promotion to the top-tier Úrvalsdeild kvenna for the first time in its history.
After a disappointing first season, where high scoring guard Chelsie Schweers was fired mid-season and head coach Baldur Ingi Jónasson resigned before the seasons end, Stjarnan bounced back in 2016-2017 behind Danielle Rodriguez stellar play and made it to the playoffs. They were beaten 3-0 by Snæfell in the semi-finals.
On 13 February 2019, behind Rodriguez 33 points, including a three-point heave from just inside the half-court line to finish the first half, Stjarnan's won Breiðablik, 103-82, in the Icelandic Cup semi-finals, advancing to the Cup finals for the first time in its history.
On June 7 2019, the board of Stjarnan withdrew the team from the Úrvalsdeild for the upcoming season and registered for the second-tier 1. deild kvenna, stating that it was necessary after several of its starters had left the team. On 22 August it was reported that the board had withdrew the team from the 1. deild kvenna after it delayed hiring a new head coach. A spokesperson for the board stated that it did not want to field a team that relied to much on non-homegrown players. The club was criticized for its actions in withdrawing the team, including by former player Ragna Margrét Brynjarsdóttir, especially since the argument of homegrown players did not apply to its men's team where the wast majority of players did not come up through Stjarnan's youth program.

Michael Moran (golfer)

Michael Moran (6 May 1886 – 10 April 1918) was an Irish professional golfer, the leading Irish golfer of his generation. He won the Irish Professional Championship five years in succession from 1909 to 1913 before moving to England and being ineligible to compete in 1914. He played in the Open Championship from 1909 to 1914 with a series of high finishes. He finished joint third in 1913 despite a disastrous 89 in the third round which included a 10 at the first hole. He died in France in 1918 at the age of 31.
Early life.
Moran won born on 6 May 1886 on Bull Island, Dublin the son of Michael and Catherine (née Curley). The house where he was born was close to Royal Dublin links.
Golf career.
Moran played in the first Irish Professional Championship which was played on Monday 20 and Tuesday 21 May 1907 at Royal Portrush Golf Club. At this time Moran was at Dundalk Golf Club. An Ireland–Scotland Professional Match was played on the prior Saturday, 18 May. On the day before the international, a 36-hole stroke-play competition was arranged for the Irish and Scottish professionals, Moran winning by four strokes from Bertie Snowball. In the international, Moran won his singles match but, playing with Alfred Toogood, lost his foursomes. Ireland won by 13 matches to 4. In the championship Moran was one of the leading 8 who qualified, through an 18-hole stroke-play contest, for the knockout match-play stage. He reached the semi-finals where he lost to Bertie Snowball by 1 hole.
By April 1909 Moran had returned to Royal Dublin and was sufficiently well known that an exhibition match against Irish Professional Champion James Edmundson was arranged at Dollymount. The 36-hole match was halved. The 1909 Irish Professional Championship was played two weeks later at Royal County Down Golf Club. Moran and Edmundson tied again in the 36-hole stroke-play stage with scores of 167. Moran met Harry Kidd in the 36-hole final, Edmundson losing in the quarter-finals. Moran started badly and was 3 down after 6 holes. However, he then won the next 6 holes and was 2 up after the first round. Moran won the first hole in the afternoon and from the 5th to the 11th holes won 6 more to win easily 9&amp;7. Moran made two trips to England in 1909. In June he played in the Open Championship at Deal, Kent. He qualified easily, scoring 153, joint fifth in his half of the draw. He had a bad first day in the championship, scoring 82 and 81, but rounds of 74 and 77 on the final day lifted him into a tie for 21st place.
He also won the Irish section qualifying for the News of the World Match Play and travelled to Walton Heath in October. He met Charles Johns in the first round and lost 2&amp;1. In September he had played Harry Vardon in a 36-hole challenge match at the new Delgany course. The match was close but Vardon won 3&amp;2.
From 1910 the Irish Professional Championship became a 72-hole stroke-play event. It was played in early June at Royal Dublin Golf Club. Moran pulled 7 ahead at the end of the first day after a second round 72, a course record. On the second day Moran set another course record of 70, extending his lead to 13. A final round of 76 gave him a 10 stroke win over Michael Cahill and 23 ahead of the rest of the field. Later in June he travelled to St Andrews for the Open Championship. There was no qualifying and everyone played one round on each of the first two days. Moran had rounds of 77 and 75 to tie for fourth place at the halfway stage. On the final day he had rounds of 79 and 81 to drop into a tie for 14th place. The main domestic event of 1910 was the Portmarnock Professional Tournament, played in early July. This had prize money of £250 and attracted most of the leading British professionals. The field of about 70 was reduced to 32 through a 36-hole stroke-play contest after which there was a match-play contest on the remaining three days. Moran had a first round 89 and only just qualified. He won his two matches on the second day, including a surprise win over Ted Ray in the last-16 round. On the following day Moran, the last remaining Irishman, lost 2&amp;1 in the quarter-final to George Duncan. Moran failed to qualify for the News of the World Match Play. Only one Irish golfer qualified and Moran lost in a playoff to Hugh McNeill.
Moran won his third Irish Professional Championship in early June 1911 at Royal Portrush Golf Club. He led after the first day on 159, three ahead of James Edmundson. In the third round Edmundson scored 75 to Moran's 78 to be on level terms. Moran then scored a final round 72 to Edmundson's 78 to win by six strokes. Later in June Moran travelled to Royal St George's for the Open Championship. The Championship was preceded by a "Coronation Match" between teams of amateurs and professionals, in celebration of the coronation of George V. Moran was selected for the professionals, joined by the amateur Lionel Munn as the Irish representatives. The match consisted of 9 foursomes matches, each over 36 holes. The result was an 8–1 win for the professionals. Moran and his partner Rowland Jones were the only professionals who lost, at the 38th hole. The 1911 Open was the last without any qualifying, and, with 222 players, the first two rounds were spread over three days. There was considerable disquiet about the format, since some of the holes were moved every day. Moran scored 72 to lead after the first day, although Edward Blackwell scored 71 on the second day, playing to different holes. After his good first round, Moran disappointed and finished tied for 21st place. Moran failed to qualify for the final stages of either of the main PGA events. A poor first round of 81 meant he missed out on the two Irish places in the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament. In the qualifying for the News of the World Match Play, Moran was involved in a three-man playoff for the one place, but missed out, as he had in 1910.
The 1912 Irish Professional Championship was played in early May at Castlerock Golf Club. Pat Doyle led after the first day on 152, having set a course record of 72 in his afternoon round. Moran was three behind on 155. Moran scored 75 in the third round to Doyle's 82 to take a 4 stroke lead. Another 75 from Moran gave him a 6 shot win over Doyle who finished with a 77. Qualifying was reintroduced for the 1912 Open Championship. Moran played on the second day of qualifying, finishing tied for second place. Moran had four steady rounds and finished tied for 15th place. Moran won the Irish section qualifying for the News of the World Match Play at Portmarnock after a playoff against Pat O'Hara. Moran lost in the first round to Harry Cawsey.
The 1913 Open Championship was held on 23 and 24 June at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake. Moran played on the second day of qualifying, finishing tied for third place after rounds of 77 and 74. In the championship itself, he had rounds of 76 and 74 on the first day to lie in third place overnight, three off the lead. Gale-force winds on the second day led to high scoring in the final two rounds. Moran had a disastrous start to his third round, taking 10 at the first hole. He went out of bounds and then took four shots to get out of a bunker. Moran continued to struggle, taking 5 at the second and 7 at the third. He was out in 48 and finished with an 89, to lie 14 strokes behind the leader. In the afternoon Moran had an excellent round of 74, the best round of the day and 15 strokes better than his morning round. This lifted him into a tie for third place with Harry Vardon, although a distant 9 behind the winner, J.H. Taylor.
The 1913 Irish Professional Championship was played on 31 July and 1 August at Portmarnock Golf Club. After two rounds Hugh McNeill led on 163, ahead of Pat O'Hare on 164. Moran was tied for fifth after a second round 88. After a third round 79 O'Hare had a lead of 5 strokes from McNeill and Charlie Pope, with Moran a further shot back. McNeill and Pope faded in the final round, while O'Hare and Moran both took 39 for the front nine. O'Hare then took 7 at the 10th and 11th and came home in 44 to Moran's 36 to give Moran a two stroke victory and his fifth successive title. Moran won the Irish section qualifying for the News of the World Match Play for the second successive year.
Played at Royal County Down, Moran won by 2 strokes on 152. He met James Bradbeer in the first round and lost at the 20th hole. The Irish section of the PGA organised a professional foursomes tournament at Royal Dublin in December 1913. Moran played with Fred Smith. After a close first-round match, Moran and Smith reached the 36-hole final which they won by one hole.
In late 1913 it was announced that Moran was leaving Royal Dublin Golf Club to be professional at Wearside Golf Club at Cox Green, Sunderland from January 1914. The move did not, however, take place, Wearside appointing James MacKenzie, the professional at nearby Seaham Harbour, in early 1914. It was almost immediately announced that Moran would replace MacKenzie at Seaham Harbour, County Durham. Having failed to reach the final stage of the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament in its first three years, Moran finally succeeded through the Northern section qualifying, an event that also incorporated the Leeds Cup. Moran was drawn with Thomas Renouf, who had won the Leeds Cup. They won their first two matches but lost in the quarter-finals. In early June Moran played in the Cruden Bay Professional Tournament. He qualified comfortably, as one of the leading 16 after the 36-hole stroke-play stage, before losing 4&amp;3 to Harry Vardon in the quarter-finals. Moran played in the Open Championship later that month. He qualified comfortably but had three disappointing rounds before a final round 76 lifted him into a tie for 25th place.
War service and death.
Moran joined the South Irish Horse in late 1915. In September 1917 the officers and men of the South Irish Horse were retrained as infantry and formed 7th (South Irish Horse) Battalion Royal Irish Regiment. The battalion was caught in the German spring offensive in March 1918. The Official History records that, "two companies of 7th Battalion Royal Irish Regiment, posted in forward zones, suffered terribly; not a man succeeded in escaping."
Moran was wounded and transferred to Le Cateau hospital where he died on 10 April 1918. Le Cateau was the site of an important German hospital centre. Since he had died in a German hospital, news of his death was delayed and it was not announced until 16 December, a month after the war had finished.

Louise Woodworth Foss

Louisa Woodworth Sanborn Foss (April 19, 1841 in Thetford, Vermont – September 22, 1892 in Malden, Massachusetts) was regarded as the best American elocutionist in her day. Compared to Charlotte Cushman, Foss was counted among the first woman elocutionists in the world.
Biography.
Louisa Sanborn was a native of Thetford, Vermont. She was educated at Thetford Academy, Vermont. 
She became a teacher and subsequently married Eliphalet J. Foss, the Boston photographer. After a few years of home life, she adopted the profession of an elocutionist, studying with Richard Reeve Baxter of Harvard College. Her local reputation as a reader was long known to the literary circles of Boston, where she was affiliated with the Boston Academy of Elocution and Dramatic Arts. By 1883, she had been before the public for five successive seasons, her engagements extending through the principal cities of twenty-two States, and extending from the east coast to the west.

Morley–Ellenbrook railway line

The Morley–Ellenbrook railway line is a planned railway line as part of Metronet in Perth, Western Australia. Construction is planned to begin in 2021.
History.
The construction of the Ellenbrook line was announced by the Barnett Government in the lead up to the 2008 election. However nothing eventuated, and Premier Colin Barnett declared that there was not yet the demand. It was again promised by the McGowan Government during the 2017 election campaign as part of its Metronet scheme.
The route alignment for the line was confirmed in August 2019. In April 2020, two consortia were shortlisted by the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia. On 22 September 2020, MELconnx Consortium (led by Laing O’Rourke) was announced as the preferred group to build the line. On 19 October 2020, the construction contract for the line was signed with MELconnx Consortium with early works to begin immediately.
Route.
The line will diverge from the Midland Line east of Bayswater Station. The line then travels in the centre of Tonkin Highway, through land north of Marshall Road and along the western side of Drumpellier Drive before ending in Ellenbrook.
Bayswater station will become a central junction for the Morley-Ellenbrook and Airport lines, with construction already underway on the Forrestfield-Airport Link.
Stations.
The line will have five stations at Morley, Noranda, Malaga, Whiteman Park and Ellenbrook, with a station planned at Bennett Springs East.
Ellenbrook Station will be built in the Ellenbrook town centre.
Whiteman Park Station will serve the people around Brabham and Henley Brook areas and those visiting Whiteman Park.
Malaga Station will serve the people around Ballajura, Alexander Heights, Landsdale and the Malaga employment district.
Noranda Station will connect Benara Road to better serve the surrounding suburbs, located under Benara Road in the Tonkin Highway median.
Morley Station will be built within Tonkin Highway under the Broun Avenue bridge, with high-frequency bus services connecting it with the Morley town centre.

3rd Manchester Rifles

The 3rd Manchester Rifles, later the 7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment was a unit of Britain's Volunteers and Territorial Force raised in Manchester. It served at Gallipoli and on the Western Front in World War I.
Volunteer Force.
The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. One such unit was the 3rd Manchester Rifles, which soon had five companies at 'Henry's', Cheetham Hill, Knott Mill, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and Newton Heath. 'Henry's' Company was raised by employees of A. &amp; S. Henry, with Major John Snowdon Henry as the first commanding officer (CO) of the 3rd Manchesters. In December 1859 men connected with newspapers and publishing formed a Manchester Press Company, which enlisted 200 men, and another company was formed at Prestwich. The 3rd Manchesters were formally adopted on 29 February 1860 as the 40th (3rd Manchester) Lancashire RVC, and the whole unit paraded at Chetham's College Yard in April, when Major Henry announced that its motto would be 'Defence not Defiance'.
Many of the original volunteers were warehousemen and clerks; however, some mill owners refused to let their employees join, and by 1862 the unit's composition was 77 gentlemen and professionals, 129 tradesmen, 62 clerks, 347 artisans from foundries and 21 labourers. Together with the 1st and 2nd Manchester Rifles and the Ardwick Artizan Rifles (numbered as the 6th, 28th and 33rd Lancashire RVCs respectively) the unit made up an unofficial Manchester Brigade at the Volunteer reviews.
The Hon Algernon Egerton, younger son of the Earl of Ellesmere, and at the time Member of Parliament for South Lancashire, was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel of the new unit on 16 May 1860. He later became its Honorary Colonel, and in 1875 his nephew, Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere became lieutenant-colonel commandant.
The unit's original headquarters (HQ) was at 11 Deansgate, Manchester, and it used the top storey of a large loom warehouse (up a flight of 100 steps) for drill. It moved its drill hall to 134 Deansgate in September 1881, but this was still unsatisfactory so the Earl of Ellesmere bought land in Burlington Street, Greenheys, where it could build a combined HQ and drill shed. A five-day 'Grand Bazaar' was organised in 1884 to raise funds for the construction, and the Burlington Street drill hall was opened in 1885.
In 1880, following disbandments and amalgamations of less successful units, the corps was renumbered as the 16th (3rd Manchester) Lancashire RVC. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, the 16th was linked with other Manchester-based RVCs, Militia regiments and the Regular 63rd and 96th Foot into Brigade No 16 (Lancashire). The 63rd and 96th Foot were amalgamated as the Manchester Regiment in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms, and the 16th Lancashire RVC was formally attached to it on 1 July. The unit was redesignated as the 4th Volunteer Battalion, Manchester Regiment, on 1 September 1888. The uniform had been scarlet with Lincoln green facings, but now it adopted the white facings of the Manchesters. At this time the unit's strength was 12 companies. Under the mobilisation plan introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum in 1888, the Volunteer Battalions of the regiment constituted the Manchester Brigade.
Territorial Force.
When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 4th Volunteer Battalion became the 7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment. The Manchester Brigade formed part of the East Lancashire Division of the TF.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
On the outbreak of war, the division was at its annual camp when the order to mobilise was received at 05.30 on 4 August. The units returned to their drill halls to mobilise, the men being billeted close by. On 20 August, having volunteered for overseas service, the division moved into camps for training, and on 9 September it entrained for Southampton to embark for Egypt.
On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units for each existing TF unit was authorised. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. From now on, the original battalion was designated the 1/7th Manchesters, and the 2nd Line the 2/7th; later a 3rd line battalion was formed.
1/7th Battalion.
The East Lancashire Division began to disembark at Alexandria on 25 September and the Manchester Bde went into garrison in that city. However, three companies of the 7th Bn were sent via Port Sudan to garrison Khartoum. Later, half of the company left at Alexandria was sent on to Cyprus. At first the division's role was simply to relieve Regular troops from the garrisons for service on the Western Front, but on 5 November Britain declared war on Turkey and Egypt became a war zone. In January the Manchester Brigade was concentrated at Cairo and initially the East Lancashire Division was assigned to guard to Suez Canal before being selected for the Gallipoli Expedition.
Gallipoli.
On 3 May the 1/7th Manchesters under the command of Lt-Col H.E. Gresham embarked on the "Ionian" and landed on 7 May (a day late) at 'V' Beach at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula. It moved forward that night to positions west of Krithia Bridge, and then on 11 May it took over the firing and support trenches in the Krithia Nullah sector. On 12 May the brigade made a feint attack to attract attention away from a movement elsewhere, and the following day two platoons of the 1/7th advanced but were unable to hold the ground and were forced to withdraw during the night.
On 25 May, the East Lancashire Division was formally designated 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and the Manchester Brigade became 127th (Manchester) Brigade.
On 28 May, 1/7th Bn in conjunction with 1/8th Bn took part in a small operation that moved the line forward, and B and D Companies dug in during the night. The lines were now within assaulting distance of the nearest Turkish trenches, and a new attack (the Third Battle of Krithia) was launched on 4 June. After a bombardment starting at 08.00, the assault was launched at noon. The Manchester Brigade led 42nd Division's attack, with A and C Companies of 1/7th Bn on the right, and in this sector all went well to begin with: despite intense rifle and machine gun fire the brigade took all its first objectives, the second wave (B and D Companies) passing through and parties advancing up to into the Turkish fourth line. The "Official History" records that 'The Manchester Territorials, fighting like veterans, were all in high fettle'. There was almost nothing between them and Krithia, and beyond that the ultimate target of Achi Baba. However, things had gone disastrously wrong for 127 Bde's neighbours, and the Turks were counter-attacking both flanks. 1/7th Battalion's position on the right was quite untenable and the brigade was ordered to withdraw. Although the Manchesters held on to the first Turkish line they had captured, casualties had been severe: the battalion lost its CO, Maj Staveacre, who had been acting since Lt-Col Gresham was evacuated to Malta on 28 May. The Manchesters consolidated their position on 5 June and held off a Turkish counter-attack on 6 June before being relieved next day and going into reserve.
On 12 June the Manchester Brigade was withdrawn from the Gallipoli Peninsula and went to the island of Imbros for rest. It returned to Cape Helles on 22 June and 1/7th Bn went up to the firing line in the Krithia Nullah sector on 24 June. They held the Turkish trench they had captured while the formations on either flank attempted to improve their positions. The 1/7th Manchesters then spent the next six weeks alternating in the line with 1/5th and 1/8th Bns. On 5 July, 1/7th Bn helped to repulse a fierce Turkish attack on the neighbouring 29th Division, inflicting heavy casualties.
A new attack at Helles (the Battle of Krithia Vineyard) began in August. 29th Division attacked on 6 August, and 1/7th Manchesters was ordered to keep in contact with its right flank. Captain Fawcus, commanding the first line of the 1/7th, was unable to find any of the 29th Division, except a few stragglers whom he brought back to the British lines after dark.42nd Division delivered its main attack at 09.45 on 7 August, but despite the bombardment and assistance from machine guns and trench mortars, the leading troops of 1/7th Manchesters could only get forward about 50 yards. By 19.15 that evening the Manchesters were back in their old positions. 127th Brigade was temporarily unfit for service and its total strength was only that of a single battalion, though it relieved 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade in the firing line near Krithia Nullah on 8/9 August. After a short rest and receiving a few drafts and returning casualties, the division was put back into the line on 19 August, still badly under strength and suffering from sickness.
In September the battalion was engaged in fatigues and trench digging. These new trenches were given names such as 'Burlington Street' and 'Greenheys Lane' reminiscent of the battalion's HQ. The battalion continued to take casualties from enemy fire and mines, and from sickness. Between 6 May and 4 November the battalion lost 163 officers and men killed, 402 wounded and 93 missing. It was finally evacuated from 'V' Beach for Mudros on 29 December.
Romani.
The Gallipoli Campaign was shut down at the beginning of January, but 42nd Division remained on Mudros until the middle of the month before returning to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and the Suez Canal defences. From February to 1916 it was stationed at Shallufa, base for the Southern Sector of the defences, broken by spells of training in the desert. In June the division was moved to the Central Sector, between Ismailia and Qantara, where the 1/7th Manchesters were attached to 52nd (Lowland) Division. In July, 42nd Division became part of a Mobile Column formed to counter a threatened Turkish thrust across the Sinai desert before it reached the canal. 127 Brigade was the advanced brigade of this force, and 1/7th Bn rejoined. On
4 August artillery fire was heard as the Battle of Romani began, and 127 Bde was rushed by railway up to Pelusium where 1/6th Manchesters were preparing defences. The newly arrived battalions passed through 1/6th Manchesters to support the Anzac Mounted Division, which was heavily engaged. The Manchesters marched rapidly through the desert in the hottest part of the day, 1/7th Bn leading on the left, but the battle was already over when they arrived. Camels carrying vital water and supplies only reached the front line troops at the end of the day. During 5 and 6 August the brigade pursued the defeated Turkish force, suffering badly from extreme heat and lack of water, with many men falling out through exhaustion, until it reached Qatiya.
During the Autumn the railway and water pipeline were pushed forward, and 42nd Division participated in the EEF's Advance to Wadi el Arish, which began in late November 1916 and completed the Sinai Campaign in January 1917.
Western Front.
42nd Division was now ordered to the Western Front. In early February 1917 it returned to Egypt and by 2 March the last troopship had left for France. The troops were concentrated at Pont-Remy, near Abbeville, and re-equipped; the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield rifle was issued in place of the obsolescent long model with which the battalions had gone to war. The division was employed on working parties in the area abandoned by the Germans when they retired to the Hindenburg Line, and then the brigades started taking turns in the line near Havrincourt Wood. On the night of 8/9 June all four battalions of the Manchesters went into No man's land to dig a new trench closer to the enemy line, which was completed and occupied the following night. The battalions also carried out regular night patrols and raids. At the end of June, 1/7th Manchesters was ordered to raid 'Wigan Copse'. After special training and with a supporting artillery barrage, 'a model raid' was made by Lt A. Hodge and his platoon on the night of 3 July, securing prisoners for no loss.
From 9 July to 22 August the division was in reserve, with 127 Bde stationed at Achiet-le-Petit undergoing intensive training. It then moved to the Ypres Salient to join the Third Ypres Offensive, passing through the Menin Gate on the night of 1 September. On 6 September the Manchesters supported an attack by 125 (Lancashire Fusiliers) Bde, which failed with heavy casualties.
After 18 days in the Salient, the division was relieved and moved to the Nieuport Sector on the Belgian coast, where it remained under constant shellfire until November. It then moved to the La Bassée–Béthune sector where it spent the winter building concrete defences to replace the existing poor breastworks. The BEF was now suffering a manpower crisis, and in February 1918 around a quarter of its battalions were disbanded to reinforce others; the Manchesters absorbed drafts from the disbanded 2/8th and 2/10th Bns.
Spring Offensive.
When the German spring offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 42nd Division was in reserve, and on 23 March it was sent south in motor buses to reinforce Third Army. 127 Brigade debussed at midnight on the Ayette–Douchy road and set up an outpost line. The following day the division was ordered to relieve 40th Division, and 127 Bde advanced in artillery formation across open ground to take up its positions. At dawn on 25 March the Germans attacked, making some penetrations but being stopped by the Manchesters. Heavy fighting followed all day but at nightfall the division was still holding the line that it occupied.
By 26 March the enemy was working round the division's flanks, and it was ordered to pull back to the Bucquoy–Ablainzevelle line; 127 Bde slipped away unnoticed. The German advance was held in front of Bucquoy, despite heavy shellfire and the weariness of the troops. The first stage of the German offensive had been checked, although shellfire and raiding continued along the line until the division was relieved on 8 April.
When the division returned to the line front, the Third Army line was relatively quiet, the Germans having switched their offensive to the north. The policy was now to advance the line by means of small raids and aggressive patrolling (so-called 'peaceful penetration'). On 16 June a party of four officers and 80 other ranks of 1/7th Manchesters raided 'Fusilier Trench'; as they withdrew, Sergeant A.S. Fleetwood carried out a wounded comrade, reaching safety 20 minutes after the rest of the raiders. On the night of 19/20 July Lieutenant N. Edge led a party of 38 men of the battalion to capture and consolidate an enemy post in front of the British line. The following night three officers and 125 other ranks of the battalion captured the enemy trench system known as 'The Triangle', and then drove off a German counterattack the following morning. During the second half of July, 127 Bde advanced more than by these means. That month the division was struck by the flu epidemic, but did receive some drafts: on 31 July the 1/7th Manchesters absorbed the remaining cadre of the 2/7th Manchesters from 66th Division ("see below"), and thereafter was simply referred to as the 7th Bn.
Hundred Days Offensive.
The Allied counter-offensive began with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August), as a result of which the Germans began to give ground, and 42nd Division followed up against rearguards. One the night of 12/13 August, as 127 Bde took over a line of advanced outposts that had been occupied that day, a heavy German counter-attack was launched but was repulsed with great loss. Third Army began its formal assault (the Battle of Albert) on 21 August. 125 Brigade advance behind a creeping barrage onto its first objective, then the barrage switched to precede 127 Brigade advancing with 7th Manchesters on the left. Assisted by morning mist, the Manchesters took their first objective, and then cleared the ravine in which the Beaucourt–Puisieux road ran, the men getting to close quarter fighting with the defenders. However, it took two attempts for the brigades to take their third objective, the Manchesters finally advancing along the ridge up to Miraumont. A counter-attack from Miraumont at 04.15 the following morning was shattered by the Manchesters, as were two more against the division that day. On 24 August the Manchesters worked round Miraumont, 7th Bn securing fords over the River Ancre, and large numbers of prisoners were taken. On 25 August, patrols of 7th Manchesters advanced against Warlencourt, and as opposition diminished a company passed through the town at 10.00 before halting to allow flanking units to catch up. The division continued to advance slowly against rearguards until the end of the month. On 2 September 127 Bde put in an attack on Villers-au-Flos with a company of 7th Bn attached to 5th Manchesters. With support from tanks, aircraft, mortars and a creeping barrage, the Manchesters fought their way through the village and were consolidating before noon. They were now in an exposed salient, but were relieved by the rest of 7th Bn that night. The following morning the battalion sent forward patrols, who found that the enemy had retired. The division then exploited this success, and a period of open warfare ensued, with cavalry going into action.
After a period of rest, the division returned to the line for the set-piece assault on the Hindenburg Line (the Battle of the Canal du Nord). 127 Brigade advanced at 08.20 on 27 September with 5th Manchesters leading over the Trescault Ridge to the first objective, after which 6th and 7th Bns passed through to the second and third objectives. 7th Battalion was exposed to enfilade fire from high ground that a flanking formation had failed to capture, and lost two-thirds of the 450 men who attacked. It dealt with two determined counter-attacks, but B Company threw out a defensive flank and held the ground. By 14.30 a weak company was on the fourth objective, but the battalion was now too weak to attempt the final objective, which was taken later that night by the rest of the division, which continued to advance the following morning.
42nd Division next participated in the Battle of the Selle. The divisional Royal Engineers bridged the River Selle on the nights of 17–19 October and the attack went in at 02.00 on 20 October. 127 Brigade set off at 07.00 and passed through towards the second objective with 7th Bn in support. Although the leading battalions were badly knocked about, they captured the village of Marou and consolidated. 7th Battalion now came up, and D Company deployed to form a defensive flank. Even though the company was reduced to 35 men, it repelled counter-attacks for eight hours. When the advance was resumed on 23 October 127 Bde was in support. During the subsequent pursuit (3–11 November), it remained in support, marching through the Forest of Mormal and across the River Sambre behind 42nd Division's advanced guards until the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November.
42nd Division remained at Hautmont on the Sambre during November, then moved to Charleroi where demobilisation began. As the men went home the division's units were reduced to cadres by 16 March 1919, and 7th Bn was disembodied on 10 April.
Commanding officers.
The following officers served as CO of the 1/7th Manchesters during the war:
2/7th Battalion.
The 2/7th Bn was formed at Burlington Street in August 1914. and shortly afterwards was included in the 2/1st Manchester Brigade of 2nd East Lancashire Division. There was a great shortage of arms and equipment, and the 2nd Line East Lancashire units had to train with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles until the end of 1915. Training was also interrupted by the need to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st Line overseas. It was not until August 1915 that the division (now numbered as the 66th (2nd East Lancashire), with the 2/1st Manchester Bde as 199 (Manchester)) was able to concentrate in Kent and Sussex. By the end of the month all Home Service men had left to join Provisional Battalions ("see below"). Early in 1916 the division was transferred to coastal defence duties in East Anglia, but training was still hindered by the requirement to supply drafts to the 42nd Division. It was not until 1 January 1917 that the division was declared ready for overseas service.
66th Division began embarking for France at the end of February, and was concentrated at Berguette and Thiennes by 16 March. It served in the desultory operations along the Flanders coast in the summer, then moved to the Ypres salient in October to join the Third Ypres Offensive.
Poelcapelle.
The division's first attack was on 9 October at the Battle of Poelcappelle. Its role was to advance up a ridge to the outskirts of the village of Passchendaele. Ground conditions were bad, but it was believed that there was no German wire to negotiate. The division began its approach march at 19.00 the evening before, and was expected to be resting at its jumping-off line by midnight. But the mud was so bad that the troops arrived 20 minutes after the attack was launched, and simply fixed bayonets and kept walking. As well as the mud, which seriously hindered movement, clogged weapons and deadened artillery fire, they were faced by unanticipated barbed wire and the artillery had made no impression on German pillboxes. Although patrols from 66th Division did reach Passchendaele, by the end of the day all temporary gains had been wiped out, and the division did note even hold a consolidated line.
Operation Michael.
When the German Spring Offensive opened, 66th Division had recently been moved from Ypres to Fifth Army and was holding a line among the undulating valleys of the River Somme's tributaries. Reconnaissance had revealed strange new holes in No man's land, which turned out to be forming-up points for the German Stormtroopers. The divisional front was held by three battalions in the Forward Zone and three out of the other six in the Battle Zone. 2/7th Manchesters was among the battalions held back from the Battle Zone, but the divisional commander had forbidden them to move into position until the battle actually started. Aided by early morning fog, the German attack on 21 March quickly broke through the Forward Zone, isolating the battalions, and continued into the Battle Zone.
The 2/7th Manchesters had to make a five-hour cross-country march under shellfire and wearing Gas masks to reach their assigned positions. HQ Company and one rifle company were established just north of Brosse Woods. About 13.00 they were spotted by a German aircraft and the bombardment was renewed, followed by an attack. Communication with brigade and divisional HQs was cut off, and the companies ran out of Hand grenades and serviceable Lewis guns shortly after 17.00. Cut off, the two companies surrendered having suffered over 70 per cent casualties. The other companies are believed to have been similarly overwhelmed in the fog.
66th Division had suffered some of the heaviest casualties during the battle, and in April its battered battalions were reduced to training cadres. 2/7th Manchesters was disbanded on 31 July, the remaining personnel being transferred to the 1/7th Bn in 42nd Division.
3/7th Battalion.
This battalion was formed at Burlington Street in March 1915, with the role of training drafts for the 1/7th and 2/7th Bns. Early in 1916 it moved to Witley. On 8 April that year it was renamed the 7th Reserve Bn, Manchester Regiment, and on 1 September it was absorbed into the 5th Reserve Bn.
28th Battalion.
The Home Service men of the 7th Manchesters, together with those of other TF battalions of the Manchesters and Lancashire Fusiliers, were combined into 45th Provisional Battalion, which became 28th Manchesters on 1 January 1917. It served in 73rd Division and was disbanded in 1918.
Amalgamation.
Officially, 42nd (East Lancashire) Division began reforming at home in April 1920 but 7th Manchesters had already reformed at Burlington Street on 7 February. However, when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the 7th Manchesters was amalgamated with the 6th Battalion as the 6th/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment on 31 December 1921. The combined battalion remained in 127 (Manchester) Brigade of 42nd Division until 1936 when it was converted into a heavy anti-aircraft regiment of the Royal Artillery, in which role it served during World War II.
On 31 July 1939, as part of the doubling in size of the TA before the outbreak of World War II, new 6th and 7th Battalions of the Manchester Regiment were created as duplicates of the 5th and 8th (Ardwick) Battalions respectively; these served as infantry during the war.
Honorary Colonels.
The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:
Battle Honours.
The battalion was awarded South Africa 1900–1902 for the service of its volunteers during the 2nd Boer War. During World War I the battalion contributed to the honours of the Manchester Regiment.
Memorials.
A stone pillar was erected in Whitworth Park as a memorial to the men of 7th Manchesters who died in World War I.
A memorial stone was laid by Harold Greenwood, formerly of the 7th Manchesters, on behalf of former comrades, when the Nightingale Centre at Great Hucklow, Derbyshire, was built in 1930–31 as a convalescent home for ex-soldiers.

World Help

World Help is a Christian humanitarian aid organization that provides help to people in impoverished communities around the world. The organization was founded in 1991 by Vernon Brewer, who had previously served as Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Development at Liberty University. The organization is involved in “child advocacy, humanitarian aid, Bible distribution, and church planting” as well as child sponsorship. Brewer's daughter, Noel Yeatts, took over the position of president in the spring of 2018.
World Help is also known for its Children of the World International Children's Choir that travels around the United States, raising awareness for child sponsorship and other humanitarian aid opportunities such as refugee relief.
Ongoing projects.
World Help has many different types of programs around the world including humanitarian aid and disaster relief, Bible distribution, child sponsorship, church planting, and clean water projects.
Disaster relief and humanitarian aid.
Crisis relief makes up a major part of World Help's global work, and the organization has played a role in delivering aid during many recent humanitarian disasters. After a 7.3-magnitude earthquake devastated the area surrounding Kathmandu, Nepal, World Help was listed among 10 trusted charities responding in the aftermath. In 2017, the organization providing relief to those affected by Hurricane Irma and in 2018 to the survivors of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
The organization also sent food, medical aid, personal hygiene kits, and clothing in response to the Fuego volcano eruption in Guatemala that left “hundreds injured, hundreds dead and nearly two million others facing devastation” in June 2018. World Help had been working for more than a decade in the region, which allowed them to respond almost immediately to the crisis. Examples of World Help's ongoing work in Guatemala include partnering with donors to provide clean water wells and medical equipment and partnering with another Virginia charity, God's Pit Crew, to deliver “blessing buckets” to families living in poverty. Each bucket is “designed for families of five and they contain 23 items – ranging from toothpaste and blankets to crayons and vitamins”.
In addition to responding to natural disasters, World Help has also provided relief to those affected man-made disasters and the global refugee crisis. Starting in 2011, the organization began “actively working with Syrian refugees,” particularly during the siege of Aleppo. In April 2018, the organization provided food, medicine, and clean water to survivors of the deadly Douma chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta, Syria. They also distribute “essentials, including towels, diapers, hygiene kits, nonperishable food items, winter coats and space heaters” to refugees who are living in displacement camps along the Jordan-Syria border. In South America, World Help's crisis relief operations have recently focused on Venezuela where ongoing political and economic conflict have led to a “severe hunger crisis” and caused more than 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country. Although Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro officially refused allowing humanitarian aid into the country, World Help found a way to covertly transport “containers of food and medical supplies into the capital city”.
Bible distribution.
As a Christian organization, World Help also participates in distributing Bibles around the world. They have been recognized most notably for their work of secretly getting Bibles and “Bible college curriculum for training church planters and future pastors” into the closed country of North Korea. In 2017, they set a goal of delivering 100,000 Bibles into the country by the end of the year. Brewer has personally traveled inside North Korea and the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and has been questioned for his perspective on recent U.S.-North Korea peace talks. In 2018, Brewer joined dozens of other Christians leaders across the U.S. in a nationwide call for prayer that a peaceful resolution could be established between America and North Korea. He has also contributed to Fox News on the subject of Christian persecution and human rights abuses in North Korea.
Freedom homes.
Another outreach of the organization is to help women and girls who have been forced into the global sex industry. As part of National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month in 2017, World Help dedicated a home in Pattaya, Thailand to offer victims a “safe place to live, meals, education, vocational training, trauma counseling, and medical care.” Pattaya is home to an estimated 50,000 sex workers. Two years later, also during Human Trafficking Awareness Month, the organization raised money to add a baking school to the Pattaya home so the women living there could learn a trade and avoid pressure to return to the streets. World Help's local missionary partners in Thailand “spend countless hours in bars all year round” and host “Night of Freedom” parties to tell local sex workers about the opportunity to escape the sex industry and come live at the freedom home instead. World Help also has a freedom home in India specifically targeted toward reaching girls in the Banchara community, a group where tradition often forces daughters into prostitution to pay for their brothers’ marriage dowries.
Children of the World Choir.
The Children of the World International Children's Choir is made up of boys and girls from Nepal, Uganda, and the Philippines between the ages of 9 and 12. The choir has been touring for more than 20 years. After each tour, “the children return to their home countries where their education up to the university level is sponsored by World Help”. While on the road, the children are homeschooled and taught English by chaperones from their respective countries. The purpose of the choir is to use “song, dance, and other creative mediums to tell forgotten stories of disadvantaged youth”.
Financials.
According to the charity assessment organization Charity Navigator, World Help commits 82 percent of revenue to international programs, 11.5 percent to administration, and 6.3 percent to fundraising. They have been accredited by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability since 1993 and have been awarded the gold-level Seal of Transparency by GuideStar. World Help submits itself annually to review by independent auditor CapinCrouse

The Beckley Jackson House, which has also been known as The Stagecoach Inn, near Hanson, Kentucky, was built . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
It was built as a Flemish bond brick single cell central passage plan house on what was then the Jackson-Providence Road. There may have been an original ell to the rear; a new ell replaced that around 1900, and an enclosed porch was added c.1920.
It was deemed " significant for its association as an early stage coach stop and post office in ante-bellum Hopkins County. It is the only building from this period associated with early inns along historic road routes in the county. The house is also the only remaining ante-bellum brick building in the rural area of the county."

OKEx is a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading various cryptocurrencies. Some of exchange's core features include spot and derivative trading. It was founded in 2017. OKEx is owned by Ok Group which also owns crypto exchange Okcoin.
History.
2018.
On April 11, 2018 the company announced its expansion to Malta, given the country's efforts to provide a sound regulatory framework for blockchain businesses and digital asset exchanges.
In May 2018, the exchange became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by reported turnover.
In June 2018, the platform became one of the largest exchanges to launch and offer a cryptocurrency exchange white label service where applicants must have solid industry experience and $2.5 million in their accounts.
2019.
In November 2019, new digital asset exchange rules were announced by the Hong Kong Securities &amp; Futures Commission (SFC). According to Reuters, OKEx said that they don't expect to see a large number of exchanges opting into the new regulations but said the new rules are positive for the industry.
On November 19, 2019 the cryptocurrency exchange said that they previously opened their Indian Telegram group a year prior to opening their Indian operations.
On November 25, 2019, the company announced four major partners for its global utility token "OKB".
2021.
According to Reuters, in February 2021 OKEx saw their biggest trading volume in history, up 26% from the previous month to $188 billion. Typically after a new cryptocurrency coin listing on OKEx, the new coin has showed a positive price jump five days later.
Controversy.
In March 2018, some major cryptocurrency exchanges were said to be charging up to one million dollars to have their tokens listed. In a response to Insider, a PR manager for OKEx denied this saying there is no listing fees for any tokens.
On July 30, 2018 a trader reportedly bought bitcoin futures with a $416 million notional value on margin, before being forced by the exchange to liquidate his position at a large loss. The exchange injected 2,500 Bitcoins - worth about $18 million at current prices - into an insurance fund to help minimize the impact on clients. However, to cover for the outstanding amount, traders who had made an unrealized profit during the previous week still had to pay a clawback rate of 17 percent, so-called "socialized clawback".
On October 16, 2020 OKEx temporarily suspended withdrawals following its founders alleged arrest. On November 19, 2020 OKEx announced that withdrawals would reopen and will resume on or before November 27.

In 2014 Deen was appointed head of Code Club Pro, which ran training sessions for teachers. At Code Club Deen recognised a large group of young people who could not engage.
In 2015 Deen founded Bright Little Labs, who use "edutaining" stories to get children to learn to code. Following a survey of over a thousand people, Deen found the negative stereotypes in technology are reflected in children's cartoons. In an interview with The Guardian, she said that "by age eight, children think that some things are for boys, some things are for girls – from toys to future careers". Her research revealed that "In kids’ cartoons under three per cent of characters are black,". The project raised £14,500 on Kickstarter. It has reached over 30 countries worldwide. 
The Kickstarter project resulted in children’s book, Detective Dot, which was first published in 2016.Detective Dot is a fictional character who works for the Children's Intelligence Agency (CIA), and invites readers to "become agents, go on missions and do investigations,". Dot's challenges are inspired by citizen science and help young people to engage with data in a real-world way. Bright Little Labs are working with educators, illustrators and writers to create stories and content linked to the computer science curriculum. In 2017 it was listed by The Independent as one of the "10 best coding toys", by the Evening Standard as one of the "best coding toys and games for kids 2018" and one of the "Best STEM toys 2019" by The Sun.
In 2016, the tech-for-good investment fund Bethnal Green Ventures invested in Little Labs.
In 2017 Deen delivered a TEDx talk at Goodenough College, "The robot revolution – a survival guide for kids". 
In July 2018,  Turner International (now WarnerMedia) made a strategic equity investment into Bright Little Labs, to power their growth, marking the group’s first entry into the edutainment space. Patricia Hidalgo, Chief Content Officer EMEA &amp; International Kids Strategy for Turner, said: “Turner shares with Bright Little Labs a passion for engaging kids in a way which is original and immersive. We see multiple opportunities to leverage our kids’ expertise to further develop BLL’s existing business and engage kids in a way that while putting entertainment first also equips them for the skills they need for today’s 21st century world.”
In 2018, Bright Little Labs opened a live Children's Intelligence Agency activity at Kidzania, London, where children develop their spy, computing and coding skills, by saving Kidzania from a computer virus, marking Bright Little Labs entry into live events.
In July 2020, Walker Books announced they were publishing the Agent Asha fiction series from Bright Little Labs. Commissioning editor Daisy Jellicoe acquired world rights from United Agents. In an interview with The Bookseller, Deen said: “Agent Asha shows kids how to navigate the modern world, with empowering role models and a hi-tech spy agency". Jellicoe added: “The series brings computer science and coding to life in such an engaging and exciting way, with an evil trillionaire, deadly sharks and a farting selfie stick. Sophie’s belief in the importance of digital literacy and critical thinking skills for all children, regardless of their background, is inspiring and Agent Asha is without a doubt a much-need protagonist for the world today.” 
In an interview with Computer Weekly, Deen said she created the Agent Asha series to “ensure that everyone has access to, and is empowered to have, a voice in our increasingly digital world,” she said. “Over the last decade, coding has become a basic literacy, like reading and writing. It’s the number one sought-after skill in employees, and workers with coding skills get paid the highest wages. Yet not everyone is able to access these skills.” 
In 2020, Vogue recommended the Agent Asha Children’s Spy Agency Activity Gift Pack for any budding adventurers.

<doc id="56724503" url="?curid=56724503" title="Santa Maria in Monterone">
Santa Maria in Monterone

Santa Maria in Monterone is a Roman Catholic church in Rome, Italy. Its suffix originates from the Sienese Monteroni family, whose patronage rebuilt the church and built a small hospice next to it for pilgrims from Siena. It is located on Via Santa Maria in Monterone in the Sant'Eustachio rione. Next to the church is a Redemptorist monastery, whose clergy manage the church.
History.
Its origins are unknown but it may first have been housed in the ruins of a 1st-century BC pagan temple or in the area around the stagnum Agrippae, after which the surrounding region is given its suffix "della Valle". The church first appears in the documentary record in an 1186 bull of pope Urban III, which mentions it as one of the daughter-churches of San Lorenzo in Damaso. It was restored in 1245 and 1597 - during the latter restoration it was raised after its repeated flooding by the river Tiber.
Under pope Innocent XI it was completely rebuilt in 1682. It remained a parish church until pope Leo XII (1823–29), when its parish was transferred to the nearby church of Sant'Eustachio. Once belonging to the Mercederians, it was transferred in the 19th century to the order of the Blessed Alfonso Liguori.
Description.
The building has three naves separated by ancient columns, each with an Ionic capital of a different design, first erected in the church in the medieval era. Its main altarpiece depicts a "Madonna and Child with Saints Peter Nolasco and Peter Pascual" by Pompeo Batoni. On the left hand side of the chancel is the baroque funerary monument of Cardinal Stefano Durazzo (1594–1667), who was once archbishop of Genoa; a skeletal memento mori holds a bas-relief portrait of the cardinal; the sculptor is unknown.

The Barricade

The Barricade is a 1921 silent American melodrama film, directed by Christy Cabanne. It stars William H. Strauss, Katherine Spencer, and Kenneth Harlan, and was released on October 2, 1921.
Plot.
When Michael Brennon became sick, he asked his partner, Jacob Solomon to take care of his son if anything should happen to him. When Michael dies, Jacob takes Robert Brennon into his home on the Lower East Side of New York City and raises him. Jacob mortgages his home and business in order to put Robert through college and medical school. After he graduates, he falls in love with a wealthy uptown socialite, Jane Stoddard, and the two marry. After the wedding, Jane convinces Robert to open his practice on Fifth Avenue, which he does, and begins to disassociate himself from his friends and family on the lower east side.
When Jacob visits Robert at his new practice, his wife and her friends are mortified that Robert could be associated with someone like him. Jane gets Robert to promise to forego any further contact with his prior life. Jane's friends discover that Jacob is not just an acquaintance, but the man who raised Robert. Meanwhile, Jacob makes excuses for Robert's actions.
Robert, realizing that he is letting his pride get the better of his character and morals, goes back to the Lower East Side to visit Jacob. There, he finds that Jacob is on the verge of being evicted, since he cannot keep up with the mortgage payments he incurred in order to put Robert through school. Understanding what he must do, he makes the decision to move back to his roots. When she realizes that she loves him more than her social standing, Jane lets Robert know that she was wrong, and he forgives her.
Production.
In July it was revealed that Cabanne would be directing a film title, "The Barricade" for Robertson-Cole. The story was penned by Daniel Carson Goodman, and the picture was to be filmed at R-C's Victor Studios in New York. In mid-August it was announced that Dorothy Richards had been added to the cast. In mid-September Ken Harlan, William A. Strauss, and Katherine Spencer joined the cast. At the same time, it was also announced that Nina Cassavant had been cast in the film, although she does not appear in the final version of the film.
Release and reception.
The picture was released on October 2, 1921. "Exhibitors Herald" gave the film a lukewarm review, claiming "Many human touches in this William Christy Cabanne production that will strike a responsive chord. Fairly interesting story somewhat handicapped by titles written obviously to point a moral." While they thought the story was fairly interesting, they also felt it was trite; they felt that Harlan was guilty of overacting, but highlighted the work of Spencer. In December the National Motion Picture League included "The Barricade" in a list of pictures labeled as family films.

Blanche McVeigh

Blanche McVeigh (August 23, 1895 – June 1, 1970) was an American printmaker, founder of the Fort Worth School of Fine Arts and Fort Worth Artists Guild, and art educator in Fort Worth, Texas. Known for her mastery of the aquatint medium, McVeigh’s leadership in art education influenced a generation of local artists, particularly members of the group known as the Fort Worth Circle. Her work is represented in several national collections as well as local and private collections.
Early life.
Blanche McVeigh was born August 23, 1895, in St. Charles, Missouri, to Blanche Fielding and William M. McVeigh, a flour mill salesman from Virginia; the family moved to Fort Worth when McVeigh was a child. She was the second of four children. McVeigh attended Fort Worth public schools and, after graduating high school, was hired as a teacher at the Walter A. Huffman School in downtown Fort Worth. She was an active participant in Fort Worth society, hosting parties, performing with the Clio Club and volunteering with the Red Cross during World War I.
Education.
Finding that she did not particularly enjoy teaching, McVeigh left Texas to study commercial art at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis in 1919-1920. Returning to Fort Worth, McVeigh spent the 1920s running an advertising agency and doing commercial art. She attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts during one summer and the Art Institute of Chicago during another; she also attended the Art Students League of New York. McVeigh spent 1927 in Europe learning aquatint, which would become her preferred printmaking medium, and studied with Oklahoma artist Doel Reed.
Career.
McVeigh was renowned for her etchings, and particularly for her mastery of the challenging medium of aquatint. Her genre images of African Americans and so-called "Negro Angels," inspired by her love of gospel music and spirituals, were especially popular with collectors.
In 1932, McVeigh founded the Fort Worth School of Fine Arts with fellow local sculptor and fellow Washington University alumna Evaline Sellors; McVeigh taught figure drawing and etching there. McVeigh and Sellors were soon joined by Fort Worth artist Wade Jolley. The school was located in the Little Theater building behind the Fort Worth Woman's Club. Although it closed in 1941 with the advent of World War II, the Fort Worth School of Fine Arts was influential because it counted members of the future Fort Worth Circle group of artists among its students, most notably Bror Utter and Veronica Helfensteller.
From approximately 1940 to 1949, McVeigh worked in a local frame shop; she owned her own frame shop on Throckmorton Street in downtown Fort Worth from 1951 until 1962. She also operated a home studio that housed her massive Sturges printing press, which is now owned by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, where it is still used in printmaking workshops. The press was so large and heavy that the floor needed to be shored up to support it. She was given the Sturges press in 1942 so she could complete a large print commissioned by the Northern Pump Company, Minneapolis.
McVeigh produced little art in the last few years of her life due to poor health.
Collections.
Works by McVeigh are included in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution, Dallas Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute, Princeton University, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Old Jail Art Center, and Amon Carter Museum of American Art.
Organizations.
McVeigh and Sellors were also founding members of the Fort Worth Artists Guild, the first Fort Worth organization to exhibit the work of local artists, in 1934. By 1937, McVeigh was also the chair of the Fort Worth Woman's Club art department.
In 1939 McVeigh was one of eight women who founded the Printmakers Guild, later called Texas Printmakers, in response to being excluded from the male-dominated Lone Star Printmakers; the others were Lucile Land Lacy, Bertha Landers, Stella LaMond, Mary Lightfoot, Verda Ligon, Coreen May Spellman, and Lura Ann Taylor. (link to page)
McVeigh was a member of the Society of American Graphic Artists, Dallas Print Club, Fort Worth Art Association, Prairie Printmakers, California Society of Etchers, Printmakers Guild of Texas, and the Southern States Art League.
Exhibitions.
McVeigh's work was exhibited at the 1937 Greater Texas &amp; Pan-American Exposition in Dallas and the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1940, McVeigh and former student Veronica Helfensteller exhibited prints in the Washington Color Show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art; McVeigh's work was also included in the 14th annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design, which was also shown at the Venice Biennale's American pavilion. In 1944, McVeigh had prints in concurrent exhibitions at the Library of Congress, Philadelphia Color Print Club, Philadelphia Print Club, and Connecticut Museum of Fine Arts. She also hosted a meeting of the Printmakers Guild of Texas at her home on Hurley Street. In the 1950s, she exhibited prints at the Brooklyn Print Show along with former student, Bror Utter, and the Society of American Graphic Artists included her prints in a collection presented to the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a memorial to American printmaker John Taylor Arms. In 1952, she had her first retrospective exhibition at the Fort Worth Art Association. In 1962, McVeigh experimented with monotype printmaking, and exhibited the resulting works at Fort Worth's Electra Carlin Gallery.
Death.
McVeigh died on June 1, 1970 at age 74. Funeral services were held at All Saints Episcopal Church; McVeigh, who did not marry, was buried alongside her parents at Greenwood Cemetery in Fort Worth. Later that year, a memorial exhibition including most of McVeigh's prints was held in the artist's honor at Electra Carlin Gallery.

Operation Robinson

The RAF bombing raid against the Schneider Works at Le Creusot, known as Operation "Robinson", was undertaken during the daylight hours of 17 October 1942. The mission was assigned to No. 5 Group, which had converted to the new Avro Lancaster. The Lancaster’s large lift capacity and high speed gave reason for optimism that the raid might succeed.
Background.
The Schneider Works was a French plant that produced steel, rails, locomotives, artillery and other armaments. It was largely viewed as the French equivalent of Germany's Krupp Works, and was located in Le Creusot in south central France. To reach it would require flying 300 miles over occupied territory.
Bomber Command had withdrawn its aircraft from daylight attacks after suffering heavy losses attempting daylight bombing raids over the Heligoland islands in the North Sea and over France during the first half of 1940. Since that time Bomber Command operations against German industry were almost exclusively conducted under the cover of night. However, the German war effort was being supported by factories in the occupied countries as well. These targets presented a problem, as bombing them at night would necessarily result in significant casualties among civilians, whose desire to resist the occupiers was being cultivated by Britain. To strike at such targets, Bomber Command would have to attempt attacks in the clear light of day. They did so against selected targets throughout the course of the war. The Le Creusot raid was one such example.
A similar raid six months earlier against the MAN U-boat engine plant in Augsburg had not ended well. Bomber Command sent 12 Lancasters on a long run across France to attempt an accurate daylight strike against the plant. The RAF ran heavy fighter sweeps and bombing attacks on coastal targets to distract German defenses. Nevertheless, while crossing northern France the force was attacked by 20 Me 109s and 4 of the Lancasters were shot down. Flak claimed 3 more over the target. Only 5 aircraft made it back from the raid, a 58% loss rate, and all those that did get back had suffered significant battle damage. As for the MAN plant, it continued to produce U-boat engines without apparent disruption. Daylight attacks against defended targets appeared to be no more practical in 1942 than they had been in 1940. It was hoped the high loss rate would not be repeated in the raid against the Schneider Works.
Planning.
For Arthur Harris, Bomber Command's commander in chief, the Schneider plant was the highest priority target in France. To minimize loss of life to French civilians any attack on the plant would have to be made during the day. In his arsenal he had a new bomber in service that was now coming to the force in significant numbers. A four engine aircraft, the Avro Lancaster had excellent range, a tremendous lift capacity and was fast. It was hoped that this would be enough to tip the scales in favor of the bomber crews.
Flying a direct route was out of the question. German fighter bases were concentrated in northern France, Belgium and Germany, and with no fighter escort available after the first 200 miles German fighter aircraft would decimate the attackers. The plan formulated was to take advantage of the range of the Lancaster and send the force out over the ocean, bringing them in to the target from the west. The planes would fly at low level to avoid radar detection. The aircraft would leave in the afternoon, make their attack as light faded, and then fly a direct return under the cover of darkness. It was hoped that the new aircraft would be fast enough to avoid German defenses and would carry a large enough bomb load to cause significant damage to the target.
No. 5 Group RAF was the only Group that had completed the conversion to the Lancaster. Harris assigned the entire Group, all nine squadrons, to attack the target. In early October 1943 the Group began training for the attack flying in formation and at low level.
Bomber Command crews were trained to fly on their own at altitude in trail and during the night. The crews were unfamiliar with low level flying, and they did not perform formation flying. 5 Group began to practice, starting with low numbers of aircraft flying together at low altitude and slowly building up until the entire Group was flying together in loose formation. With this strange sort of flight training there was much debate among 5 Group crews as to what the target might be. The tension was heightened by several false alarms when the aircraft were fueled, armed with bombs and placed in readiness. These were potential go days, but each time the mission had been scrubbed due to projected poor weather over the target. Harris needed clear weather over Le Creusot to give his crews the best chance of hitting the plant while avoiding French civilian casualties.
On 17 October 1942 the weather was declared right. Operation "Robinson" was on.
The raid.
94 Lancasters took off in mid-afternoon and formed up before heading south and over the ocean. 88 of the aircraft were committed to the main target, while 6 were to fly on to nearby Montchanin to knock out the coal fueled transformer station located there, which supplied electrical power to the plant.
The Group was led by Wing Commander L.C. Slee, the CO of 49 Squadron. Slee had been in command of 49 Squadron since 14 May 1942. Following his squadron out over the Atlantic was 9 Squadron, 44 Squadron, 50 Squadron, 57 Squadron, 61 Squadron, 97 Squadron, 106 Squadron and 207 Squadron. At the head of 106 Squadron was Guy Gibson, who would go on to fame with 617 Squadron.
The Group flew south out over the Bay of Biscay at 1,000 feet, then turned 90 degrees, dropped altitude down to 100 feet and headed in towards France. The Group flew over the island of Île d'Yeu, some 48 miles south of St. Nazaire, potentially alerting the Germans to their approach. The nearest German fighter squadron was based at Lorient, protecting U-Boats pens there. The Group reached the coast, but encountered no German response. The Lancasters flew on, racing toward their target over the 300 miles of French countryside at tree-top height. Four aircraft suffered minor damage from bird strikes and two men were injured, but the low level flying resulted in no serious accidents going in. The Group navigator brought the force right on course to the navigational pinpoint of Nevers, at the confluence of the Allier and the Loire. Here they made a slight bend to the right, placing them on track for Le Creusot. Over the last 60 miles the Group climbed, staggering the squadrons between 2,500 and 7,500 feet for the release of their bombs. They arrived at Le Creusot at dusk, with enough light to see the target and the soon approach of darkness to cover their retreat. They found almost no Flak over the target. Visibility was excellent and the target easily identified. The Group quickly passed overhead, with the bulk of the formation dropping its bombs over a 7-minute period while six Lancasters continued on with their loads to Montchanin. With bombs gone the crews turned north and headed for home. At the debrief most crews reported their bombing had been accurate. No aircraft were lost in the attack on the Schneider Works. At Montchanin one Lancaster came in too low, caught the roof of a building and crashed into the ground beyond.
Results.
Returning crews reported a successful attack and Guy Gibson's official report next day, and his subsequent account of 'one of the greatest low-level daylight raids of the war', were celebratory, as wartime morale required, but one of Gibson's flight commanders, Squadron Leader John Searby, later wrote that 'Le Creusot was a profound disappointment and he said as much on his return.' Post-strike photographs took some time to obtain. For several days the weather was unsuitable. Then, on 21 October, the photo-reconnaissance Spitfire was shot down over the target. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Tony Hill, famed in intelligence circles for his low-level pictures of German radar installations, was pulled alive from the wreckage, but soon died of his injuries. Eventually another Spitfire made a successful run. The pictures showed that Searby's misgivings were justified and that much of the bombing had fallen short on to the workers' housing. Even so, there was considerable damage to the general machine shops and locomotive machine shops, the steel sheet and bar mills and a 650ft warehouse which was completely destroyed. Production at the Schneider Works was halted for three weeks, and repairs continued on the plant for eight months. The raid had been well executed in most respects. The navigation by Wing Commander Slee's navigator, Pilot Officer A S Grant, was perfect. However bombing accuracy had been poor. Bomber Command's Operational Research Section 'thought this was partly attributable to the failing light and the smoke which soon began to drift across the target, but they also thought that the tactics adopted had been inappropriate and that the bomb sights had not been properly used. They suggested that the outcome was the penalty of employing night crews in complex daylight operations without giving them more than a few days' training.' Crews had been ordered to climb and accelerate immediately before target, which made it impossible to set the Mark IX Course Setting Bomb Sight correctly, since this sight required a long, straight and level run-up to target in order to calculate the drift and could not adjust for the aircraft's attitude. Even at fairly low height, the bombs had to be released more than a mile short of target, to allow for forward travel on the drop, and the calculations were complex. The much more advanced, computerised and gyro-stabilised Mark XIV bomb sight, with automatic input from the aircraft's flight instruments, only entered squadron service some months later. Additionally, the bombers were under-armed, carrying less than 4,000lb each, as the Lancaster's exceptional load-carrying ability was still not fully recognised. The following month, the Lancaster's official all-up (maximum take-off) weight was increased from 60,000lb to 63,000lb, and after mid-1943, when the limit was raised to 65,000lb, Lancasters would seldom carry less than an 8,000lb bomb load, even when fully fuelled to 2,154 gallons for maximum range. After the eight months of repair works on the Schneider plant at Le Creusot had been completed, on 19/20 June 1943 Bomber Command struck again, this time in greater strength and at night: 290 bombers, mostly Halifaxes and Stirlings, attacked, about 20 per cent of the bombloads hitting the Schneider plant. Residential areas suffered heavy damage. The following night, Leonard Slee, by now a group captain, would lead Operation Bellicose, an attack by 5 and 8 Groups on a German radar factory at Friedrichshafen, with considerable success.

Oliver Toussaint Jackson

Oliver Toussaint Jackson (April 6, 1862 – February 8, 1948) was an American businessman and entrepreneur, who, inspired by Booker T. Washington's autobiography "Up from Slavery", formed Dearfield, Colorado, a self-sufficient agricultural settlement for black Americans. Prior to this venture, Jackson was a successful owner of several restaurant and catering businesses in Denver and Boulder.
Early life.
Oliver Toussaint Jackson was born on April 6, 1862, in Oxford, Ohio. He was one of six children born to Hezekiah Jackson and his wife Caroline, both of whom were former slaves. He was educated in Ohio and was entrepreneurial from an early age. He began his career in 1876 working at restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio and became a caterer. After hearing stories of African Americans resettling in the West, Jackson relocated to the Denver, Colorado area in 1887, where he worked as a caterer; two years later, he married Sarah "Sadie" Cook, the sister of his brother James's wife and the paternal aunt of composer Will Marion Cook. By 1894, Jackson had made enough money to purchase a farm near Boulder, and also lived at 2228 Pine St. in Boulder. He opened the Stillman Cafe and Ice Cream Parlor on 13th St. in Boulder in December 1892. The cafe was described as "one of the most select dining resorts and one not usually found outside of metropolitan cities." Jackson became a manager at Boulder's Chautauqua Dining Hall in 1898 where he supervised 75 employees. He later operated a popular seafood restaurant at 55th and Arapahoe in Boulder that remained open until the city went dry in 1907.
Dearfield.
Jackson's first wife either died or the couple divorced in the early 1900s. Subsequently, he remarried to schoolteacher Minerva J. Matlock in 1905 and returned to Denver to work as a messenger for Colorado governors. He had helped elect John Franklin Shafroth governor of Colorado in 1908 and in return Shafroth appointed him messenger for the governor's office. Jackson would serve under four other Colorado governors. Jackson read Booker T. Washington's autobiography "Up from Slavery" (1901), becoming enamoured with Washington's socio-political stance on black land ownership. Jackson fully embraced Washington's views and lobbied Governor Shafroth for support of his plan for an agricultural settlement for black Americans. Shafroth helped him take advantage of the Homestead Act of 1909 to apply for land for homesteading.
In 1909, Jackson purchased 320 acres of land in Weld County and modeled the community after Union Colony, founded in 1870. A year later, Jackson's agricultural settlement for black Americans, named Dearfield, was officially established, attracting settlers from Denver, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Early groups struggled: some were forced to live in tents or holes in the nearby hillsides, and there were continual shortages of fuel and water; bitter winter conditions in the first year nearly killed settlers. All of the water rights to the land had been purchased so there was no water for irrigation. Early homesteaders had to carry water from a river almost a mile away. Over time, however, the community prospered with a variety of crops—‌corn, melons, and squash—‌which surged in price during the First World War. By the end of 1917 there were 500 residents. Minerva served as the unofficial mayor of Dearfield while Jackson continued to work in Denver and promote the community. By 1921, Dearfield was valued at $750,000 and had a population of 700. Jackson sought to capitalize on the town's success by erecting a cannery and soap factory.
However, over the next 10 years a series of disasters hit the community including a crash in commodity prices, the return of soldiers from WWI who didn't want to live on farms, and a transition from wet to dry conditions. In the 1930s, the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl decimated Dearfield, forcing Jackson and settlers to sell their homes for lumber. By 1940, only 12 residents remained. Jackson stayed, vainly seeking a young black man to reestablish the community.
Death and legacy.
Jackson died in the Weld County Hospital in Greeley, Colorado, on February 8, 1948, at the age of 85. Dearfield became a ghost town after the last resident left in 1973, and the site was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Anti-protist or antiprotistal refers to an anti-parasitic and anti-infective agent which is active against protists. Unfortunately due to the long ingrained usage of the term antiprotozoal, the two terms are confused, when in fact protists are a supercategory. Therefore, there are protists that are not protozoans.

National Museum of Education (Albania)

The National Museum of Education (), it is a national museum located in Korçë, Albania. The museum is set up in the building where the March 7, 1887 opened the first Albanian school, otherwise known as Mësonjëtorja. It contains the history of Albanian writing and Albanian publications, such as the first Albanian alphabet written by patriot Naum Veqilharxhi and the second Albanian alphabet written by Kostandin Kristoforidhi. There are also pictures and photos of prominent patriots who contributed to the opening of the school, such as Pandeli Sotiri, Petro Nini Luarasi and Nuçi Naçi.
Building.
The National Museum of Education is located in the building where the first school of Albanian language was opened (on 7 March 1887), or as otherwise known as "Mësonjëtorja e Parë Shqipe" (). The building itself dates back to the 1840s, the house retains many of its original features and today it holds the status as "Monument of Culture" in Albania. Since the time of its construction, the building has been mostly in public function towards the society. The building was the home of the patriot of Korçë, Diamanti Tërpo, who donated the building to the Albanian school.
From 1887 to 1902 there was "Mësonjëtorja", where it was later administered by Ottoman authorities, which used the building as a prison until the Young Turk Revolution, where local Albanians took over again the administration of the building, to reopen the Albanian school and to set up the musical and patriotic band called "Banda e Lirisë" on 1 October 1908.
As a school, the building continued until 1967, the year when it was given the function as a museum space with the name of National Museum of Education, as well as still called today.
Exhibits and Collections.
The museum offers interesting material for visitors, the historic journey of the first Albanian school, such as photographic portraits of the founders, contributors, directors and its pupils in years. There are also exposed books and texts used by its pupils and alumni at "Mësonjëtorja" time, objects used by Albanian patriots and linguists who have been part of school history. In the museum is improvised the office of the Director of Mësonjëtorja, which is documented in the manuscript memoirs of one of its firstest directors, Nuçi Naçi. The office room serves as a separate pavilion and there it is also placed the "Libri i Vizitorëve" () where visitors and tourists can leave their notes on their impressions to the museum.
In the museum there are exhibited two of the firstest editions of the Albanian alphabet "(in 1844 and 1845)", published by Naum Haxhi Llazar Bredhi or more commonly known as Naum Veqilharxhi. These alphabets were distributed in Southern Albania, especially in the Korçë and Përmet areas.

Background.
After she presented the album "Izvorne i novokomponovane narodne pesme" (2013), Brena said that she was starting to work on a new album and that she wants to be an "ultra-modern album with urban sound". However, instead of an entire album, she released only a few singles. And as the reason for this, she cited the authors' crisis for good and quality songs.
On December 28, 2013 she released the single "Ljubav uvek čuvam za kraj". The lyrics were written by the songwriter Marina Tucaković, while Srki Boj was responsible for music. She previously announced the song with a snippet on Radio Pingvin, and talked about the new single. She said that the song was a New Year's gift for all her fans.
On January 12, 2014 she released the single "Zaljubljeni veruju u sve". It is a song written exclusively for her by Hari Varešanović, with whom she sang together at the New Year's Eve.
On 14 September 2015 she released the single "Ljubav nova". The song was written by Alka Vuica and Amir Kazić Leo. High-resolution music video, produced by Toxic Entertainment, was filmed with a movie camera at several locations on the Croatian coast. "We expect the video to appear shortly after some more frames are edited, but also we have decided to move some of the borders when the video is in question", Lepa Brena's team said.
On February 14, 2016 she released the single "Žali Bože". The text was written by Marina Tucaković, and music by Damir Handanović. On April 19, 2016 Brena released the single "Carica". This song was also written by Tucaković and Handanović. The video for the song, as well as "Žali Bože", was produced by Toxic Entertainment.
Lepa Brena for the first time collaborated with Dragan "Braja" Brajović on the new album. Braja wrote four songs, two ballads and two songs with modern sound, as Brena wanted for the album.

Parkbridge (from Irish: meaning 'Bridge of the Field') is a townland in the civil parish of Moyacomb, barony of Shillelagh, County Wicklow, Ireland.
Geography.
Parkbridge is bounded on the west by Raheengraney, on the east by Park townland, on the north by Coolruss townland, and on the south by Drummin townland.

The first mention of the name is in post office records as follows:
"Park Bridge: A small bridge with two arches over a stream without a name"
1608 "The Parke", CPR, 1636 Le Parke, Chancery Inq;
c.1638 Parketown, Earl of Meath Documents; c. 1660 Parke BSD, HMR;
1760 Park, Levilles Map

History.
The townland appears in the listing of rents under the estate of Lord Fitzwilliam in the 1800s. A post office was opened in Parkbridge in 1878 and was closed on 23 November 1997 when its post town was Enniscorthy.
Antiquities.
Underneath the bridge and beside the Gráinne river an unmarked Gráinne's Well exists. It has been known to be of spiritual importance to the people of the area, who in times past gathered water and prayed there.
