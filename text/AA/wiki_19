Canal Mauri

Canal Mauri is a canal in Peru and Chile. It transfers water from the Mauri River watershed and transfers it into the Caplina River for irrigation purposes. An earlier canal Canal Uchusuma was constructed in the early 19th century and was replaced by the Canal Mauri. This canal collects water from several tributaries of the Mauri River (notably the Uchusuma River) and diverts it through Chilean territory into the Quebrada Vilavilani, a tributary of the Caplina River; from there it is later diverted for irrigation purposes in the Tacna region. 
The diversion has damaged wetlands in the region and consequently the expansion project "Vilavilani II" - which would take additional water from the Mauri River directly - has engendered opposition. 
Name.
The canal is known in Peruvian sources as "Canal Uchusuma", but also as "Azucarero", "Alto Uchusuma" or "Canal Uchusuma Alto". "Canal Uchusuma" is also the name of a canal near Tacna, which starts on the Quebrada Vilavilani at Chuschuco; this canal is also known as "Canal Uchusuma Bajo". The Patapujo Canal is for parts of its path also known as Chuapalca-Uchusuma.
Hydrology.
According to measurements taken in the years 1936-1956, the amount of water transferred was about through both the Canal Mauri and Canal Uchusuma; further measurements in 1952-1972 indicated a yield of . A publication in 2012 estimated a yield of . 
The amount of water withdrawn from the Uchusuma River is large enough that the river only reaches the Mauri during wet periods when the capacity of the diversion is exceeded. This has also resulted in damage to the wetlands that are located along the Uchusuma, as well as complaints by the Bolivian government.
Path.
Canal Mauri is a transbasin diversion that transports water from the Lake Titicaca watershed to the Pacific slope. The construction of the canals was facilitated by the gentle terrain of the Mauri River valley. Other infrastructure associated with the Canal Mauri are the reservoirs Paucarani () and Condorpico (); they store water for Tacna and the valley and regulate water flows in the Uchusuma River. Laguna Casiri is an additional reservoir in the system.
A series of diversion dams on the Quebrada Casillaco, Quebrada Chungará, Quebrada Iñuma of the Kallapuma River basin (a tributary of the Mauri) are the source of the long Patapujo II canal, whose final part has a construction aimed to dissipate water energy. This canal in turn becomes the Patapujo I canal, which also receives water from groundwater sources. These canals have capacities of , they collect water from tributaries of the Mauri River to transfer it to the Uchusuma. In 2016 another canal named Calachaca was put into service for the same purpose, since the Patapujo canal was leaky. Another diversion on the Quebrada Queñuta collects its water separately in the Canal Queñuta and diverts it to the Uchusuma River.
The canal proper starts at a diversion dam on the Uchusuma River and runs for ( of it through Chilean territory) in a rectangular canal. The Patapujo I canal joins it soon afterwards, and there are two gauging stations there. The path of the canal takes it through Chilean territory from Laguna Blanca along the Arica-La Paz railway southwestward between the mountains Tacora and Caracarani, close to the Canal Uchusuma. It turns around Tacora, crosses the Rio Azufre and ends close to the Peru-Chile border between the mountains Cerro Huaylillas and Cerro Tabajchuno (Paso Huaylillas Sur) into the Quebrada Vilavilani. It crosses the Cordillera Barroso through the long Huaylillas Sur tunnel, the water then enters the Quebrada Vilavilani proper. The Canal Mauri has a capacity of .
The Quebrada Vilavilani descends the Andes in southwestward direction, where it has several different names, and ends close to the city of Tacna into the Caplina River. There is a diversion on the Quebrada Vilavilani before it reaches the Caplina at Chuschuco, which gives rise to another canal also known as "Canal Uchusuma".
History.
Already during Spanish colonial time plans were developed to use the waters of the Uchusuma for irrigation. After Chile had occupied what is now its northern territory and Peru's Tacna Department during the War of the Pacific, it examined the possibility of transferring water from the Mauri River into Tacna to enable irrigated agriculture. Construction of the canal finally began in 1921, over the objection of Bolivia which was concerned about navigation on the Desaguadero River (where the Mauri ends into) being impeded by the loss of water and water supply issues; Bolivia however succeeded insofar as the Mauri River itself was not diverted. In 1929, the Treaty of Lima transferred the canal and Tacna back to Peru, which thus became the owner of the system; further the treaty established that Peru had a right to maintain the parts of the canal that still laid in Chile.
An early proposal by the engineer Jorge Vargas Salcedo envisaged transferring of water from the Mauri to the Laguna Blanca northwest of General Lagos on the present-day Peru-Chile border. Laguna Blanca would operate as a reservoir and receive additional waters through and long canals from the Uchusuma and Putani rivers, respectively. The plan projected that about of land could be irrigated at a capital cost of ; the revenue from the irrigated land would be sufficient to offset the investment.
The Canal Uchusuma already existed since 1820; it intercepted water from the Uchusuma River. The Canal Mauri replaces the Uchusuma canal, but according to a report in 1977, the Canal Uchusuma is still used when the other canal is under maintenance. Groundwater wells were added to the system in 1970 and 1995. The Canal Patapujo became operative in 1992. In 2001 the canal Canal Mauri was modified to reduce seepage losses. Plans to expand the diversion system to the Mauri River itself hit opposition by Bolivia in 2009 and 2010.
In 1977 it was suggested that creating a reservoir in the Uchusuma River would increase the availability of water for the system, since the capacity of the Uchusuma diversion is limited and excess water flows past the diversion. The Electric Power Development Company as a consequence of a contract with the Peruvian government concluded in 1960 devised a plan to extend that canal to the Mauri by pumping water from a reservoir that was to be built on the Mauri, close to the border with Bolivia. The plan was shelved owing to the lack of information on the area and the opposition of the Bolivian government (the reservoir would have extended into Bolivian territory).
Current status.
The Canal Mauri is currently a major source of water for the Tacna valley. Further plans published in 2015 envisaged the transfer of water directly from the Mauri River (at Villachaullani) to the Calachaca canal and from the Ojos de Copapujo springs by 2017 and from the Chiliculco River by 2019; this concept is known as "Vilavilani II".
Hydrological analysis of this concept (along with two planned reservoirs at Chuapalca and Chilicollpa) suggest that the Mauri River would lose about 50% of its flow through such diversions and even more during drought periods. Additional wetlands would be impacted. This has resulted in opposition by inhabitants of affected areas and by the Puno Region. Such water disputes about reservoirs and river diversions have become common in Peru.
Minsur's Pucamarca gold mine lies close to the canal, raising concerns about water in the canal becoming polluted. The mine with reserves estimated to be 555,000 ounces gold is from the canal. Minsur as a compromise undertook a project to cover part of the canal to resolve issues. The first part of this project was completed in 2014 and covered about of the canal.

Aspire (political party)

Aspire is a minor political party in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets formed by the former mayor Lutfur Rahman and councillors elected as members of his party, Tower Hamlets First. After Tower Hamlets First was removed from the register of political parties following voting fraud and malpractice, its councillors formed the Tower Hamlets Independent Group (THIG). After some defections, the remaining Tower Hamlets Independent Group councillors later registered formally as a political party in January 2018. Most of its elected members were former Labour Party members, with a few exceptions. It was the largest political opposition on Tower Hamlets Council prior to the 2018 May elections.
Background.
Tower Hamlets First was established by Lutfur Rahman on 18 September 2013. The party stood candidates in the 2014 Tower Hamlets Council election, where it won 18 out of 45 seats, becoming the second-largest party on Tower Hamlets Council and the fifth-largest political party out of all London borough councils. The party was suspended in 23 April 2015, after an election court report that found Rahman "personally guilty of 'corrupt or illegal practices' or both" with the party labelled as a "one-man band". The party was removed from the list of political parties maintained by the Electoral Commission on 29 April 2015.
Following the dissolution of Tower Hamlets First, the majority of former party members established the Tower Hamlets Independent Group (THIG) to co-ordinate activity on the council. Six members subsequently left the Tower Hamlets Independent Group to form the competing People's Alliance group. The remaining THIG councillors then became Aspire.
Although then barred from running for elected office himself, Rahman was behind the party. Aspire is his second attempt at a new party after an application under the name 'Tower Hamlets Together' was rejected.
Initial representation.
Between its formation and the May 2018 elections, Aspire councillors occupied 10 of the 45 council seats on the Tower Hamlets Council.
Ohid Ahmed was previously a Labour Party councillor and cabinet member between 2002 and 2010. He was also the Labour Party candidate in West Suffolk at the 2010 general election, and Deputy Mayor of Tower Hamlets between 2010 and 2014. Harun Miah was formerly a Respect Party Councillor. Maium Miah was formerly a Conservative Party councillor for Millwall before joining Tower Hamlets First, and stood in Canary Wharf ward in 2014.
The party's general secretary, Lillian Collins, was formerly Labour's party chair in Tower Hamlets.
2018 elections.
Ohid Ahmed stood in the 2018 election for directly elected Mayor of Tower Hamlets, coming third behind Labour and the People's Alliance of Tower Hamlets, a group that had earlier split from the Tower Hamlets Independent Group. Ahmed had been endorsed by Rahman.
On 4 April 2018, Aspire launched its campaign for the borough elections in Tower Hamlets, with a full slate of 45 council candidates. It won no seats.
2019.
Aspire stood in two council by-elections in Tower Hamlets on 7 February 2019, with Harun Miah winning the one in Shadwell ward and Ohid Ahmed coming second in Lansbury ward.
2021.
On 12 August 2021, Aspire stood in the by-election to the Weavers ward of Tower Hamlets, with candidate Kabir Ahmed winning with 47%. He had previously served as the ward Councillor until 2014. The by-election was caused by the death of Labour's John Pierce.

The Parliamentary Review

The Parliamentary Review is a British pay-to-publish journal, with organisations having to write their own copy and pay £3,500 for it to be published.
The journal is owned by Westminster Publications Ltd, a for-profit venture that is not affiliated with Parliament or the UK government.
History.
It was established in 2012 by Daniel Yossman, then a 23-year-old graduate in Russian and business management from the University of Manchester. Eric Pickles was appointed chairman of the publication in 2017, and former home secretary David Blunkett was appointed as co-chair in 2018.
Previous editions have featured forewords from high-profile politicians such as prime ministers Theresa May and David Cameron alongside chancellor Philip Hammond and secretaries of state Esther McVey, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Gavin Williamson and Damian Hinds. The review also regularly features forewords from the chief executives of industry-leading trade bodies, such as TechUK, the British Retail Consortium, the Federation of Master Builders, EEF and the British Property Federation.
"The Parliamentary Review" sends letters inviting organisations to be represented in the publication. It has received criticism for the charges, sometimes up to £4,000, that are made to some of the organisations that take them up on the invitation, as well as for implying that it has links to parliament. This criticism has been highlighted by articles in the national press, including "The Daily Mirror", "The Times", and Schools Week.
In particular, the publication and its publishers have been accused of misleading headteachers of schools across England. School leaders have reported being led to believe they were being singled-out for commendation for their good work, but were then asked to stump up thousands of pounds to be featured.
In 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority investigated three issues raised against "The Parliamentary Review" and on 6 November 2019 upheld the complaints. They concluded that the letters sent to businesses were not clearly identifiable as a marketing communication and that they were misleading in that they gave the impression of being an official government publication. Furthermore, they concluded that the articles within "The Parliamentary Review" were advertorials that should have been labelled as advertising.

Alberto T. Roraback

Alberto T. Roraback (born Sheffield, Massachusetts, August 23, 1849 - died Canaan, Connecticut, February 1, 1923) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge. He was a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court from 1908 to 1919.
Early life.
Roraback's father John C. Roraback was a farmer, the descendant of German immigrants from one of several settlements named "Rohrbach" in Lorraine who had settled in Columbia County, New York around 1700. He moved his family to Sheffield, Massachusetts in the Berkshires around 1846. Alberto attended public schools in Sheffield and then the South Berkshire Institute in nearby New Marlborough. He then went to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York. In 1870 he entered the law offices of Judge Donald Warner in Salisbury, Connecticut to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1872.
Public service.
Roraback became a successful lawyer based in North Canaan, Connecticut. He also was involved in Republican Party politics, serving as a delegate to the 1888 Republican National Convention and on the Republican State Committee. From 1889 to 1893 he served as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Litchfield County. In 1895 and 1897 he was elected as a Republican to the Connecticut House of Representatives from North Canaan. In 1897 (with the Republicans back in control of the legislature) he was reappointed to the Court of Common Pleas, and then to a vacancy on the Superior Court. In 1907 he was reappointed to the Superior Court and also to the Connecticut Supreme Court (then called the "Supreme Court of Errors") upon the mandatory retirement of Justice William Hamersley in 1908. He retired in 1919 on reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, although he continued to work as a State Referee until his death.
He was memorialized in his official obituary prepared by Chief Justice George W. Wheeler as "one of the most competent trial court judges of his generation".
Family.
Roraback married Minnie E. Hunt, daughter of ironmaker Edward P. Hunt, in 1873. They had 7 children, of which 5 were alive in 1906: Grace, Louise, Albert E., Joseph Clinton (b. 1882), and Catherine. Albert E. Roraback (1880-1973) was a football center at Yale University and became a minister; Joseph Clinton Roraback also played football at Yale and became a lawyer. Albert E. Roraback's daughter Catherine Roraback (1920-2007) became a notable civil rights lawyer, best known for "Griswold v. Connecticut".
Roraback was a brother to J. Henry Roraback, Connecticut Republican party boss of the early 20th century - although Henry was 21 years younger. Henry took over Alberto's private practice in 1897 when Alberto was reappointed to the Superior Court.
Roraback's younger first cousin Willard Andrew Roraback (1860-1928) studied law with him and was also in the Connecticut House in 1895, representing Torrington.

Lebanon Plantation

Lebanon Plantation is a state historic site located at 5745 Ogeechee Road in Savannah, Georgia. The site is over consisting of a large estate granted to James Deveaux in 1756, and was named for the many cedar trees on the property. An additional 500 acres were granted to Phillip Delegal in 1758 and eventually became part of the plantation. The site was purchased by Joseph Habersham in 1802. Habersham sold it in 1804 to George W. Anderson who built the main house that was rebuilt and added on to after the American Civil War. Anderson's son, George Wayne Anderson, JR Commanded Fort McAllister in the Civil War, and after the fort fell, Lebanon became his prison and the headquarters of the Fifteenth Army Corps of the US Army.
After occupation, the main house at Lebanon was partially destroyed, and foreclosed upon in 1868. It was recovered by George W. Anderson in 1871. The extent of the damage to the original house is not known, but was rebuilt and repaired by April 23, 1873. Anderson later divided the property and allowed French immigrants to form a colony called L'Esperance. They planted and cultivated vineyards that did not succeed. In 1916, Savannah's Mills Bee Lane, father of the city's preservationist Mary Lane Morrison, purchased the plantation from the Anderson family heirs, and grew a new variety of orange, called the Savannah Satsuma. It was later owned by Morrison's son, Howard J. Morrison Jr. (1943–2019), and his wife, Mary Reynolds Morrison, the third generation of the Lane–Morrison family to continuously own the property.
Lebanon remains a working plantation today, much in the same manner it has for over two centuries.
Geographical setting.
Lebanon Plantation is situated approximately southeast of downtown Savannah in Georgia's Lower Coastal Plain region. Located at 5475 Ogeechee Road, just off historic Highway 17.
History.
Early history.
Native Americans have probably inhabited the area on at least a semi-annual basis for thousands of years, as indicated by oyster shell deposits excavated in the vicinity. By the time European explorers arrived in the area in the 16th century, the area was claimed by the Yuchi and the Creek tribe. When the first permanent English colonists landed at what is now Savannah in 1733, the area was part of the domain of the Yamacraw, a detached branch of the Creeks, although the area was apparently uninhabited at the time. James Oglethorpe, the leader of these English colonists, maintained a friendly relationship with the Yamacraw chief Tomochichi, and managed to peacefully acquire the Savannah area and the lands in its vicinity.
Throughout the late 17th-century, Spain (which had established itself in Florida in the previous century) retained loose control over the Georgia coast via Native American allies. This inevitably brought them into conflict with the growing English colonies to the north, namely North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1702, South Carolina governor James Moore led an expedition against Spanish settlements in Florida and, en route, raided and destroyed the Spanish Native American missions off the Georgia coast. While Spain still claimed the coast and islands, the area was largely abandoned, creating a buffer zone between Spanish Florida and the English Carolinas.
In the early 1730s, the English decided to colonize the islands between the Carolinas and Florida. A charter was granted in 1732, and the first colonists set sail in the same year. The English colonists that arrived at Savannah in 1733 formed the core of what would eventually become the colony and state of Georgia.
Establishment of Lebanon Plantation.
Nearby, Noble Jones' fortified house was one of several defensive works built between Frederica on Saint Simons Island and the Savannah townsite. The English were concerned that the Spanish still claimed the area and would eventually attempt to expel them. Conflict erupted in 1739 with the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the name for the regional theater of the greater War of the Austrian Succession. Jones took part in an English raid along the St. Johns River in northern Florida in 1740, as well as the successful defense of Frederica at the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742. The end of the war in 1748 largely neutralized Spanish threats to the new colony. The land that would become Lebanon Plantation was granted to James Deveaux in 1756. An additional 500 acres was granted to Phillip Delegal in 1758, that eventually became part of the plantation.
Irishman Stephen Deane and African Fenda Lawrence, partners in the African slave trade, raised their mixed race children at Lebanon during the American Revolution.
Antebellum Lebanon.
The practice of slavery had been banned by Georgia's original charter, so many land owners used indentured servant labor to tend the fields in many plantation's early years. When the Trustees revoked the ban on slavery in 1749, most turned to slave labor in order to make them profitable. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Lebanon was occupied and served as the headquarters of the Fifteenth Army Corps, under the Command of General William Babcock Hazen. After the fall of Fort McAllister, its Commander, George Wayne Anderson Jr. was imprisoned in his own home. General Hazen and Lt. Col. Strong invited General William Tecumseh Sherman to dinner, to celebrate their victory. In a kind gesture of respect, General Hazen also invited Major Anderson to attend the meal, after clearing the request with Sherman. The discussion was surely lively - during the meal Anderson engaged in a heated exchange with General Sherman about the tactics employed to defend the fort and the bravery of all who fought there. Cigars were exchanged and smoked, tributes were made to the fallen.
Lebanon in the 20th century.
Lebanon Plantation reflects the organic architectural growth of a plantation house continually occupied through several generations. From its antebellum origins, destruction and rebirth after the Civil War, Reconstruction and remodeling, the main house has retained its identity and character. The Neo-Classical veranda of the twentieth century coexists with the core of the house built in the Greek Revival style of the nineteenth century.
Lebanon Plantation today.
Today Lebanon's Verdant Kitchen, founded in 2012 by Howard Morrison and Brisbane native Ross Harding, produces beverages, baked goods, candies, snacks and spices available at regional farmers markets, online and in specialty gourmet and grocery stores.
The ginger crops, including turmeric and galangal — also known as Thai ginger — are grown and harvested at Lebanon Plantation, then sliced, dried and ground at raw food temperature in the plantation's USDA-certified organic processing facility. The products are then made in the company's USDA-approved kitchen in Atlanta.

Ashe Windham

Ashe Windham (17 February 1673 - 4 April 1749), of Felbrigg, Norfolk, was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1708 to 1710.
Life.
Windham was the eldest son of William Windham of Felbrigg (died 1689) and his wife Katherine Ashe, daughter of Sir Joseph Ashe, 1st Baronet of Twickenham. His maternal uncle was Sir James Ashe, 2nd Baronet and his brothers were William Windham and Joseph Windham Ashe. The Windham family had had a seat at Felbrigg Hall since the mid-15th century. Whilst at Eton College he succeeded his father in 1689. After attending King's College, Cambridge, he took a grand tour round Italy between 1693 and 1696.
In 1708, he was due to marry Hester Buckworth, but she died, and a year later, in summer 1709, he married a wealthy heiress, Elizabeth Dobyns, the daughter and heir of William Dobyns of Lincoln's Inn.
Parliamentary career.
Windham was first considered as a parliamentary candidate in 1699, for Norfolk (his father had unsuccessfully run for it in 1679 as a Whig). However, according to Humphrey Prideaux, his grand tour counted against him:
Windham stepped down from the 1705 election campaign in favour of his friend and cousin Roger Townshend, whom he replaced at the 1708 British general election, contesting the seat unopposed and becoming the first of his family to sit in Parliament. That year he was said to possess "as great estate as any commoner in the country".
Windham was one of the main MPs behind an unsuccessful address to Queen Anne on 25 January 1709 requesting that she remarry. He voted for the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He and Robert Walpole II stood for Norfolk at the 1710 British general election but were defeated and he declined to stand again in 1713.
Later life and legacy.
Windham's marriage failed, and after the birth of a son in 1717, the couple parted. He retired to Felbrigg to manage his estates and look after the education of his son. He also had one illegitimate daughter.
A portrait of Windham by Sir Godfrey Kneller is owned by the National Trust and held at Felbrigg.

Catherine Engelhart Amyot

Catherine (Cathinca) Caroline Engelhart Amyot (1845–1926) was a Danish painter who specialized in portraits and genre works. She travelled widely, creating a number of works of historical interest. In 1869 she began exhibiting in Düsseldorf and Copenhagen. After marrying the English physician, Thomas Amyon, from 1879 to 1890 she exhibited frequently in the Paris Salon and in London's Royal Academy of Arts.
Early life and education.
Born in Copenhagen on 6 February 1845, Catherine Caroline Engelhart was the adopted daughter of the National Bank official Christian Engelhart and his wife Nathalie née Rønne. She was raised in Copenhagen where she was taught to draw and paint by the Danish painter Carl Bøgh (1865–66) but, wishing to keep abreast of the latest developments in art, she travelled abroad from 1867. After first moving to Brussels, she settled in Düsseldorf for seven years, studying under the Swiss artist Benjamin Vautier and the German Karl Ferdinand Sohn.

From 1869, Engelhart exhibited in Copenhagen's Kunsthal Charlottenborg as well as in Düsseldorf. The most successful painting she exhibited in Copenhagen was "Ingen roser uden torne" (No Roses without Thorns, 1874) which was purchased by the Danish Art Society "Kunstforeningen".
She travelled to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1875 and then to Stockholm where she painted two posthumous portraits of King Carl Johan as king of Norway. They had been commissioned by King Oscar II. One of them now hangs in the Bernadotte Parlour in the Royal Palace in Oslo.
After returning to Denmark for a short stay in Copenhagen, she embarked on another study trip, this time to Paris. Here she studied from 1876 under William-Adolphe Bouguereau who considered her to be one of his best students. While in Paris, she met the English medical doctor Thomas Howse Edward Amyot whom she married on 16 May 1878. Thereafter, the couple moved to England where they settled first in Norfolk and from 1882 in London. Many of her later paintings were genre works, often depicting her daughter Catherine Florence as a model.
Family and later life.
Catherine and Thomas Amyot had three children, all born in Diss, Norfolk: Thomas (born 1879), Catherine Florence (born 1880) and Noel Ethel (born 1882). There are records of the Amyots living in Kensington (1891) and in Margate (1901). Thomas Amyot died in late 1903.
Little is known about Catherine Amyot's later life but she died in Sèvres, southwest of Paris, in 1926.

Stephen Calk

Stephen Calk (born 1964/1965) is the founder, former Chairman and CEO of The Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered National Bank headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. He was an economic advisor to Donald Trump during the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. Calk currently serves as an Ambassador for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.
Calk was convicted of conspiracy and bribery in July 2021 for providing loans to Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign, in exchange for a possible high-ranking position in the Trump administration.
Early life and career.
Calk was born in Detroit, Michigan, and was raised in Florida, Illinois, and London. He attended the United States Military Academy Preparatory School, and is a 1988 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
In 1982, he enlisted in the United States Army and was honorably discharged as a Private First Class before he was early commissioned as an Army Officer. He is a graduate of the United States Army Aviation School and served in both active and reserve status as a combat helicopter pilot and commander for over 16 years.
In 1998, Calk received a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Calk is also a graduate of the nine-year Presidents Program in Leadership at Harvard Business School.
He has served his community numerous civic and philanthropic boards including serving as the Chairman of the United States 10th Congressional District's Service Academy Selection Committee and as a Certified Leader in the Boy Scouts of America. He has served as a Trustee for the University of Illinois St. John's Catholic Newman Center and on the Board of the USO of Illinois. Since 2002, he has been a member of the Chicago Chapter of the World Presidents Organization and Young Presidents Organization. He is a proponent and advocate of Veteran housing needs. Calk is a former trainer and mentor of junior military officers and senior non-commissioned officers before taking command positions or returning to civilian life after service to their country. He serves as an Ambassador for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. Before, he is a graduate of the United States Army Aviation School and served in both active and reserve status as a combat helicopter pilot and commander for over 16 years. Also, he enlisted in the United States Army and was honorably discharged as a Private First Class before he was early commissioned as an Army Officer. He has also served on numerous civic and philanthropic boards and is a member of The Economic Club of Chicago, The Harvard Club of New York City, Halter Wildlife Preserve, and The Chicago Club where he served on the Membership Commission. Calk is a nationally recognized expert in the fields of finance, economics, and real estate finance as well as National Security and Military issues.
Calk's banking career began in 1995 when he founded Chicago Bancorp, which has been described as "one of the largest privately-held retail mortgage banks in the country” and served as its president until it was later absorbed into The Federal Savings Bank, where, with his brother John, he focused on issuing mortgage loans on single-family homes to veterans.
In 2014, Calk moved his bank's headquarters to Chicago after the city offered him tax breaks. Calk struck an agreement with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel that promised to bring up to 400 new employees to a gentrifying neighborhood west of downtown. The city agreed to pay the bank $10,000 per employee, in what was the largest-ever grant of its kind, to cover job training costs. In the end, Calk and his brother John pulled off a neat trick: Their bank, among the most profitable in the country that year, collected $3.6 million in public subsidies in substantial part by hiring employees. The city and the bank said in written responses to questions that Federal Savings fulfilled all of its obligations and that the funds were only paid after the job training was completed and verified. A multimillion-dollar deal between Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Stephen Calk was supposed to deliver 400 new jobs to the city. On April 23, 2012, Stephen Calk said in an email to a city official that Federal Savings Bank's board of directors had approved plans to establish a national home loan center in Chicago, subject to receiving a training allowance of $10,000 per employee. Under the deal, Chicago's financial commitment was to come from a portion of the city's TIF program that is dedicated to job training. Between early 2012 and March 28, 2013, the city of Chicago awarded two TIFWorks contracts totaling $2.1 million to Federal Savings and its holding company, according to city records. In 2015, the city awarded another $1.5 million to the holding company, bringing the total to $3.6 million. However, a spokesman for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development told that the city was aware that the bank's training would cover both incumbent and new employees. The program's guidelines state that the funds can be used both to train new hires and to provide training that upgrades the skills of current employees. The Federal Savings Bank, which specializes in home loans for veterans and first-time homebuyers, has 1722 employees.
In 2016/2017 Calk served as a Senior Economic Advisor to the President-Elect of the United States and he has served as an advisor to the Governor of the State of Illinois, the Commissioner of Banks. and Real Estate and the Office of Professional Regulation for the State of Illinois on matters of Mortgage Banking and Real Estate finance. Calk had been named to the Trump campaign's economic advisory panel in August 2016. Calk was nominated by Congressman Phillip Crane and subsequently appointed to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School at West Point.
In 2016, he was an economic advisor to Donald Trump during the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. Calk calls himself a centrist who backed President Barack Obama in 2008. He says he's only met Trump three or four times, at social or charitable events. “He seemed to take a real interest in the fact that I was a single dad, that I was a family man, that I built my business, and I think he had a lot of respect for that,” Calk says. Calk has respect for Trump's economic plans, especially cutting child-care costs and cutting business taxes to 15 percent. “He wants to see America on top, and I think the way he will deliver that message will probably be in a very measured way,” he says. Trump's economic team is totally composed of white men — no women, no minorities. Calk said this is only the initial group. He expects more diversity when additional advisers are added.
In 2017 Calk was named EY Entrepreneur of the Year finalist, Midwest division. He has served on the board of directors, advisory board of directors, or customer advisory board of directors for various public and private companies, including JP Morgan Chase’s Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., Ohio Savings Bank, Citimortgage, Bank of America, and the former General Electric Mortgage Insurance Company. He is regularly featured in print and on-air national news programs, including CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Fox Business News, CNBC Squawk Box, CBS evening news, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The Washington Post, Reuters, Money, Crain's Chicago Business, the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times. Calk has served as an advisor to the Governor of the State of Illinois, the Commissioner of Banks and Real Estate, and the Office of Professional Regulation for the State of Illinois on matters of Mortgage Banking and Real Estate finance.
The Federal Savings Bank of Chicago.
Calk's banking career began in Kansas, where, with his brother John focused on issuing mortgages on single-family homes to veterans. He moved his bank's headquarters to Chicago in 2014 after the city offered him tax breaks. After it, Calk has served as an advisor to the Governor of the State of Illinois, the Commissioner of Banks and Real Estate and the Office of Professional Regulation for the State of Illinois on matters of Mortgage Banking and Real Estate finance.
In 2011, Stephen and John Calk announced that with the approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision they have closed the deal and purchased the more than 100-year charter and assets of Generations Bank from Armed Forces Bank. Before, in 1995 Stephen established and served as CEO of Chicago Bancorp, which has grown to be one of Illinois’ largest privately held retail mortgage banks.
In 2014, Calk struck an agreement with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel that promised to bring up to 400 new employees to a gentrifying neighborhood west of downtown. The city agreed to pay the bank $10,000 per employee, in what was the largest-ever grant of its kind, to cover job training costs.

Between early 2012 and March 28, 2013, the city of Chicago awarded two TIFWorks contracts totaling $2.1 million to Federal Savings and its holding company, according to city records.
In 2014, the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago signed an agreement to cooperate with the New York City real estate firm Douglas Elliman, and in exchange, either Douglas Elliman or its parent company, the Vector Group, invested in Calk's bank, according to a 2015 deposition by Howard Lorber, the Vector Group's CEO. Lorber, a longtime friend, and ally of Trump's, later served with Calk on the Trump campaign's economic council.
In 2015, the city awarded another $1.5 million to the holding company, bringing the total to $3.6 million. However, a spokesman for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development told that the city was aware that the bank's training would cover both incumbent and new employees. The program's guidelines state that the funds can be used both to train new hires and to provide training that upgrades the skills of current employees. The Federal Savings Bank, which specializes in home loans for veterans and first-time homebuyers, has 1722 employees.
In 2019, Calk resigned as chairman and CEO from the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago.
Loans to Paul Manafort.
Manafort first got in touch with Calk's Federal Savings Bank of Chicago in April 2016, according to testimony given by the bank's senior vice president Dennis Raico at Manafort's August 2018 trial for fraud and tax evasion. Manafort, Calk, and Raico discussed loans and politics over dinner in New York in May 2016. On July 28, Calk became directly involved in discussions about loans to Manafort and his son-in-law for investment properties, which Raico told the court was unusual. Subsequently, over a lunch, Calk and Manafort discussed another loan. On October 6, 2016, Manafort emailed Calk to say that he had been mistaken in saying at this lunch that he owed $2.5 million on a Bridgehampton, New York, property that he intended to use as collateral. In fact he owed $3 million. "I must have had a blackout," Manafort wrote in his email. On October 16, Manafort asked to change the terms of the loan, requesting a line of credit on the property instead of using it as collateral for a construction loan for a California property. In his application materials for the loan, Manafort provided a 2016 income statement for himself that his business partner Rick Gates later testified was false. 
James Brennan, another vice president at the bank, testified at Manafort's trial that Manafort failed to declare in his application materials that two of his New York properties were already mortgaged and that Manafort's statements about his income in 2015 were inconsistent. Brennan also testified that bank employees had noticed that Manafort seemed to have no income as of July 2016, though he claimed to be owed $2.4 million, that he was more than 90 days late on a $300,000 credit card bill. Concerns within the bank about the propriety of the loan were overruled by Calk, however, and on November 16, 2016, Manafort received from Calk's bank a $9.5 million cash-out refinance loan on a house in Bridgehampton, New York. "It closed because Mr. Calk wanted it to close," Brennan testified. On January 4, 2017, Manafort received an additional loan from Calk's bank, a $6.5 million construction loan on a property on Union Street in New York City. The two loans, totalling about $16 million, were the largest and second-largest ever issued by the bank. The combined size of the loans at the time represented around 5 percent of the bank's asset base of $341 million, and represented about 22 percent of the bank's equity capital of $72 million.
The bank has since written the loans off as a loss.

The Occupation

The Occupation is a single-player video game developed by White Paper Games and released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on 5 March 2019. The game takes place in a single government building, in real-time over four hours. The game advances with or without input from the player, but almost all in-game actions can affect the game's story.
The game is set in late 1987 within the same universe as White Paper Games' first title "Ether One".
Gameplay.
The game does not have a health bar or energy system, when the game needs to punish the player it does so by using up the player's time, for example if a player is caught doing something they should not, they are taken to a security office and lose 15 minutes of game time, which shortens the time available to achieve the main aim of the game, obtaining knowledge.
Plot.
Prior to the start of the game; a terrorist attack has killed 23 people and led the British Government to create The Union Act, a "controversial act which threatens the civil liberties of the British population."
The game's plot starts at 3:27 PM on 24 October 1987. The player character is a journalist that is researching The Union Act, players have freedom of choice on how to act; become a whistle blowing journalist fighting against the act, or do nothing as the game progresses on its own.
Development.
The game was developed on Unreal 4 and uses dynamic artificial intelligence, which combines scripted activities for the in-game characters, along with deviations to their normal routine based on their in-game requirements or interactions. The developers illustrated this by explaining the actions of a character called Dan, a Scottish Muslim who is a "towering bald man who screams security", he breaks his usual desk based routine, because of his need to pray at certain times, creating a circumstance that the player can take advantage of should they wish.
Reception.
Awards.
The game was nominated for "Best Use of Game Engine" at the Develop:Star Awards.

Évelyne Baylet

Évelyne Baylet (born Évelyne Isaac: 14 June 1913 - 6 November 2014) was a French company director. She served between 1959 and 1995 as president of the La Dépêche du Midi newspaper group, while pursuing a parallel career as a regional politician.
In 1970 she became president of the departmental council for Tarn-et-Garonne, a department in the southwest of France. Membership of departmental councils had been based on since 1848, and on universal adult suffrage since 1944, but it was only in 1970 that Évelyne Baylet became the first president of any departmental council in France who was also a woman.
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Évelyne Isaac and her twin brother were born into a Jewish family in Batna, a substantial inland city in northeastern Algeria. Her grandparents had moved across from Alsace after 1871. Maurice Simon Isaac (1882-), her father, was a Corps des mines member. Her mother was a school teacher. She pursued her studies at the girl's lycée at Constantine, and then at the University of Algiers from which she successfully graduated (with so-called "Khâgne" and "Hypokhâgne" pre-university degree qualifications). Between 1937 and 1940 she taught French, Latin and Greek at a girls' school in at Bône (as Annaba was known at that time).
Marriage and war years.
On 30 December 1940 Évelyne Isaac married Jean Baylet (1904-1959), a Radical Party politician and director of the Dépêche de Toulouse (regional newspaper). They had met while Évelyne was accompanying her mother who was undergoing at Ax-les-Thermes. The ceremony took place in Jean Baylet's home town, Valence-d'Agen. The marriage would produce three recorded children including the politician-journalist Jean-Michel Baylet. By 2014 there were also seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren.
In September 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland. France reacted (along with Britain) by declaring war on Germany. Eight months later, in May 1940, Germany invaded France: by the end of July 1940 a puppet government, based in Vichy, was administering approximately the southern half of France (including Toulouse). In 1943 , a senior Vichy official, launched an enquiry in the region on behalf of the "Commissariat général" into the "Jewish question". Évelyne Baylet hastened to disappear, changing her name to Eliane Bories.
Liberation came in June 1944 and ushered in a period of fevered recrimination. The Dépêche de Toulouse faced a ban and its premises were sequestrated because, during the German occupation, the newspaper had been taken over by and published. Jean Baylet had been elected as mayor of Valence-d'Agen in 1930 and remained in office throughout (and long after) the Vichy years, but he had taken care, if quietly, to distance himself from the collaborationist authorities, refusing to hang the portrait of Marshal Pétain on his office wall at the town hall. Any residual suspicions that he was too close to the Germans were helpfully undermined on 9 June 1944, very shortly before liberation, by the Gestapo who suspected him of helping the Résistance and arrested him.
Aftermath of Vichy.
Starting in 1944, Jean and Évelyne Baylet spent two years assembling evidence of their "Résistance credentials" and submitting applications to have the newspaper business returned to the family. With the need for secrecy gone, there was abundance evidence available from numerous well placed witnesses of the extent of the practical help Jean Baylet had given to those opposing the German occupation. In 1946 they obtained the necessary "ordonnance de non-lieu", confirming that they were not to be pursued as suspected "Vichy collaborators". The times were uncertain and lawless, however, and the Bayets were still prevented from returning to the newspaper offices. On 24 October 1947 Jean Baylet turned up at the newspaper's Toulouse offices accompanied by the rugby team from nearby Valence-d'Agen. By this time it was six months since a court had formally restored the newspaper to him, but the individuals occupying the offices had turned a deaf ear to the court. Now, however, they were persuaded to depart. At the same time, the newspaper's Paris office was recovered. Évelyne Baylet had already spent a considerable amount of time in Paris, pleading with officials at all the government ministries that might be persuaded to show support, but this had failed to achieve a result. She therefore turned up early at the newspaper's offices in the prestigious , accompanied by Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury. Later, in 1957, Bourgès-Maunoury would serve (briefly) as Prime Minister of France, but in 1947 he was merely an ambitious young opposition politician and, importantly, a witness of what happened next. The two of them installed themselves in the best arm chairs, to await the arrival of the "new master" of the place. When he arrived and asked what they were doing there, they explained they were doing the same as he was: "occupying the place". The ensuing conversation, as reported, was brief and to the point. The Paris offices were recovered. The newspaper returned to the streets in its southwest heartland on 22 November 1947, now renamed La Dépêche du Midi. During the next twelve years the newspaper recovered its authority and its political "king-maker" status in the region defined approximately by a circle with a radius of approximately 100 kilometers surrounding Toulouse.
The young widow.
Jean Baylet died relatively young, in a motor accident: he collided at high speed with a tree after a motor cyclist cut across his path, on 29 May 1959, The next day his widow appeared at the printing plant and told the assembled employees "I am going to take over the direction of this newspaper" ("Je vais assumer la direction de ce journal"). She had little obvious relevant experience, while legally 76% of the ownership of the business passed directly to her teenage children. But, as she later explained, she thought she was "best places to look after the interests of the newspaper", and over the next forty years that is what she did. In order to anticipate any who doubted her intentions, she joined her late husband's name to her own. Mme Évelyne Baylet became Mme Évelyne-Jean Baylet.
Politics.
She also assumed her husband's political mantle. Jean Baylet had served as mayor of Valence-d'Agen since 1930. Évelyne-Jean Baylet succeeded him between 1959 and 1977, after which the position passed to the couple's son, Jean-Michel Baylet. There was nothing seamless about that succession, however. It involved a fierce contest that ended up in a court case. Jean-Michel Baylet's rival for the mayoral office in 1977 was Danièle Malet-Baylet, his elder sister. As mayor from 1959 Évelyne-Jean Baylet also followed her late husband in representing Valence-d'Agen as conseiller général at the . She sat as a member of the Radical Party, switching after 1973 to the newly relaunched Radical Party of the Left ("Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche" / MRG). Ten years after taking over her husband's place on the Departmental council for Tarn-et-Garonne, in 1970 Évelyne-Jean Baylet took over as council president, the first woman to take on such a position anywhere in France.
Final years.
In 2012, now aged 99, Évelyne-Jean Baylet retired from her most enduring position, being her directorship of the La Dépêche du Midi newspaper group. Her place was taken by Jean-Nicolas Baylet, her grandson. She died just over two years later.

Challacombe (horse)

Challacombe (1902 – 8 January 1917) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed little ability as a two-year-old, showing no worthwhile form in six starts. In the following year he made steady progress, winning seven races, culminating with an upset victory in the St Leger Stakes. He was subsequently retired to stud but had no success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Challacombe was a bay horse with a white star bred by F W Dunn. As a yearling he was put up for auction at Doncaster and was bought for 570 guineas by Alec Taylor Jr. on behalf of the American-born Washington Singer. Taylor, who trained the horse at Manton, Wiltshire, later expressed his disappointment that the colt had never been entered in the Epsom Derby. The horse was named after a small village in Devon.
He was sired by St Serf who won the Rous Memorial Stakes and went on to sire several other good horses included the 1000 Guineas winner Thais. Challacombe's dam Lady Chancellor was a distant, female-line descendant of the dam of the Epsom Oaks winner Nike.
Racing career.
1904: two-year-old season.
Until 1946 two-year-old racehorses in Britain did not have to be given official names and the colt who was to become Challacombe raced unnamed as a juvenile in 1904. The colt made no impact, as he failed to win or place in any of his six races.
1905: three-year-old season.
The still unnamed colt returned in the spring of 1905 and began to make steady progress. He won the Union Jack Stakes over one mile at Liverpool in April and the Wood Ditton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse later that month. In May he followed up by taking the Tudor Plate at Sandown Park and the Chippenham Plate over one and a half miles at Newmarket. At Royal Ascot in June he finished unplaced in both the Gold Vase and the Triennial Stakes. In July he ran for the first time under the name "Challacombe" and won the Coombe Plate over one mile at Sandown Park. Later that month he was moved up in class for the Duchess of York Plate over ten furlongs at Hurst Park he finished third behind the Oaks winner Cherry Lass. The colt returned to Hurst Park in August and finished second to Costly Lady in the Holiday Plate. On his final race before contesting the St Leger Challacombe contested the weight-for-age Newdigate Stakes over one and a half miles at Gatwick Racecourse in early September, and won "very easily" from the four-year-old St Denis.
130th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 September was much anticipated as the field was expected to include the season's three outstanding three-year-olds, Cicero, Val d'Or and Cherry Lass. When Cicero was withdrawn with a leg injury, and Val d'Or was prevented from crossing the English Channel from France by rough weather, Cherry Lass became the clear favourite. The race was run in wet and "dismal" conditions but nevertheless attracted the customary huge crowd. Cherry Lass went off at odds of 6/4 ahead of Llangibby (third to Val d'Or and Cicero in the Eclipse Stakes) and Polymelus with Challacombe, ridden by Otto Madden the 16/1 fourth choice in an eight-runner field. It was reported that Challacombe, who was equipped with blinkers, had been considered unlikely to run in the race until the withdrawals of Cicero and Val d'Or. Challacombe was not among the early leaders but drew alongside the tiring Cherry Lass in the straight before pulling away to win "easily" by three lengths from Polymelus with the favourite three lengths back in third place. The winning time of 3:05.4 was a new record for the race.
Challacombe ended the year with earnings of £6,847 making him the sixth most financially successful horse of the season.
1906: four-year-old season.
Challacombe remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win any major races.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Challacombe an "average" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Challacombe retired from racing to become a breeding stallion but had no success as a sire of winners. Challacombe was euthanised on 8 January 1917.

Canal Uchusuma

Canal Uchusuma is a canal in Chile.
The canal begins at the northeastern foot of Cerro Huancune on the Uchusuma River, a principal tributary of the Mauri River; the diversion occurs at the locality "Ancochaullanta" at elevation. The path of the canal takes it southeastward through Peruvian territory until the Peru-Chile border at Laguna Blanca. It continues through Chilean territory from Laguna Blanca along the Arica-La Paz railway southwestward between the mountains Tacora and Caracarani, close to the Canal Mauri. It turns around Tacora's southern flank to its western side while following a low-altitude moraine, crosses the Rio Azufre westward and then the border between Chile and Peru. In Peru it continues southwestward and ends between the mountains of Cerro Huaylillas and Cerro Chulluncane into the Rio Yungane. It does so by crossing the mountains through the Huaylillas Norte tunnel. The Rio Yungane subsequently joins the Quebrada Vilavilani. The Quebrada Vilavilani descends the Andes in southwestward direction, where it has several different names, and ends close to the city of Tacna into the Caplina River.
This canal was constructed in 1820. There were numerous projects to expand the canal system to more water sources in the Mauri, and the Canal Mauri was constructed in 1954. According to a report in 1977, the Canal Uchusuma is still used when the other canal is under maintenance.

Vaccine (instrument)

Vaccine (or sometimes "vaksin") are rudimentary single-note trumpets found in Haiti and, to a lesser extent, the Dominican Republic as well as Jamaica. They consist of a simple tube, usually bamboo, with a mouthpiece at one end.
They are thus also referred to as "banbou" or "bambú", as well as "bois bourrique" (or "bwa bourik"), "granboe", "fututo", or "boom pipe". They are not to be confused with other Haitian handmade trumpets called "konè" or "klewon", made of a yard-long white metal tube with a flared horn, called "kata".
Vaccine players are known as "banboulyès".
Origins.
Haitian ethnographer Jean Bernard traces the vaksin back to indigenous precolonial peoples of Haiti. However both Thompson and Holloway draw links to the single-note Bakongo bamboo trumpets called "disoso", themselves originated in Mbuti hocketing music. Gillis also likens them to trumpets used in Bambara "broto" music along the Niger, and Jamaican Kumina.
Construction.
Traditionally, vaccine are made of a length of bamboo, hollowed-out and dried, with a node membrane pierced and wrapped with leather or bicycle inner-tube rubber to form a mouthpiece at one end. One or more segments are taken from higher or lower in the bamboo trunk to fashion vaccines; usually more than 1m long and 5 to 7 cm in diameter. Each one is cut shorter or longer in order to produce a higher or lower tone: "bas banbou" is long and gives a low-pitched sound, and "charlemagne banbou" is short and is pitched high.
McAlister explains that Afro-Hispaniolan lore involves asking the bamboo plant for its use and leaving a small payment in its place. Landies witnessed this process, which she described as follows: "the harvest of the bamboo was accompanied by an offering. [...] [It] is harvested with the permission of Simbi, a Petwo Lwa who loves water, as bamboo in the Dominican Republic grows in moist land, e.g., along rivers"
On occasion, iron or plastic pipes are substituted for the bamboo.
Playing.
A typical vaccine band is composed of three to five players, usually marching abreast of each other. Players use a method called hocketing, whereby each individual blows a single tone rhythmically to create an ostinato motif together. These motifs are usually composed through a process of group improvisation.
To keep rhythm, vaccine players also beat a rhythmic timeline, called "kata" with a long stick on the side of the tube, making the instrument both melodic and percussive.
Tuning and scale.
Within an ostinato, vaccine tones stack up in approximate third intervals to each other—creating tritones and arpeggiated diminished
chords, but without a harmonic intent—with the two treble-most vaccines often tuned a semitone apart. Landies also reports other intervals between the lowest two voices. One of the vaccine serves as the tonal center of the motif.
Uses.
Most importantly, vaccines are a key component of rara orchestras. In his 1941 article, Courlander wrote that rara bands ""seldom have drums and depend almost entirely on" vaccines"; though both Lomax's mid-1930s and McAllister's early 1990s studies report many more instruments—mostly percussive—as part of rara orchestras.
Scholars also report vaccines used as signal horns by parties of agricultural workers, fishermen, stevedores as well as sometimes used in dances of the Congo cycle.

Tanya Talaga

Tanya Talaga is a Canadian journalist and author of Anishinaabe and Polish descent. She worked as a journalist at the "Toronto Star" for over twenty years, covering health, education, local issues, and investigations. She is now a regular columnist with the Globe and Mail. Her 2017 book "Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death and Hard Truths in a Northern City" was met with acclaim, winning the 2018 RBC Taylor Prize for non-fiction and the 2017 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing. Talaga is the first woman of Anishinaabe descent to be named a CBC Massey Lecturer. She holds honorary doctorates from Lakehead University and from Ryerson University.
Early life and education.
Talaga is of mixed heritage, describing her ancestry as being one-fourth Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) and half Polish. Her maternal grandmother is a member of Fort William First Nation and her great-grandmother, Liz Gauthier, was a residential school survivor. She was raised in Toronto and spent summers with her mother's family in Raith, Ontario, a small community one hour northwest of Thunder Bay. When she was twenty years old, she learned that a sister had been given up for adoption and that three of her mother's siblings had also grown up in the foster care system. She notes that these experiences influenced her later work on the impacts of residential schools and intergenerational trauma.
Talaga studied history and political science at the University of Toronto. She wrote and edited the university's student newspaper "The Varsity" and volunteered on "The Strand", a publication of Victoria College.
Career.
Talaga was hired by the "Toronto Star" in 1995 as an intern. She worked as a general city reporter for 14 years, covering several beats, before transferring in 2009 to the Queen's Park Bureau. She also wrote as the indigenous issues columnist.
Her first book, "Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death and Hard Truths in a Northern City", was released in 2017 to critical acclaim and shortlisted for numerous awards in both 2017 and 2018. The book examines the deaths of seven First Nations youths in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and began when Talaga was assigned to write a story about why more First Nations people were not voting in the 2011 federal election, only to find that many people were reluctant to cooperate with her story because the deaths were not its focus.
Talaga delivered the 2018 Massey Lectures, entitled "All Our Relations: Finding the Path Forward". Based on her 2018 Massey Lectures Talaga released her second book, "All Our Relations: Finding the Path Forward", which shares the name with the lecture series.
In 2020, "All Our Relations" was nominated for the British Academy’s Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding.
Talaga's first podcast, the seven episode Seven Truths, which tells contemporary stories through the lens of the Anishinaabe Seven Grandfather Teachings, was released by Audible on November 26, 2020.
Talaga also owns the production company Makwa Creative Inc. Her documentary film "Spirit to Soar" premiered at the 2021 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, where it won the Audience Award in the mid-length film category.

Manorowen

Manorowen is a small settlement and parish on the A487 southwest of Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, West Wales, in the Community of Scleddau; the parish includes the village of Scleddauthe eastern part of which is in the neighbouring parish of Llanstinan. A listed property bears the name of the parish, and the church is dedicated to St Mary.
History.
The origin of the parish name is obscure because there have been many different spellings throughout history, including Maenor Owain, Manerowen, Manorawen and Manernawen, but the earliest recorded document is dated 1453. It is marked as Manerowen on a 1583 parish map of Pembrokeshire.
In 1688 John Lewis Esquire of Manernawen (sic) was appointed Commissioner for Haverfordwest under an act to collect money for a royal grant.
The parish church of St Mary is 19th century with later additions, but contains a memorial dated about 1670; the oldest gravestone is about 1791. The church was closed for a time following a bat infestation, but remedial work resulted in its reopening in 2015.
Manorowen is the name of an estate, whose house, walled garden and gazebo are Grade II listed. The present house dates from about 1830. According to the charity "Parks and Gardens", the site was first created between 1650 and 1699, and was recorded by Richard Fenton as belonging to his great grandfather John Lewis (see above) in the late 17th century when it was called Manarnawen.
Lewis's 1833 "Topographical Dictionary of Wales" notes Manorowen (or Maenor-Owain) as being a small parish in the Hundred of Dewisland, with 220 inhabitants.
From 1913 until 2004, there was a school at Manorowen. The school's log books, admission register, photographs and miscellaneous papers are held at the Pembrokeshire Archives.
Notable people.
David Jones, vicar of Llangan and an early supporter of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism, lived in Manorowen and Richard Fenton (1747-1821) is buried there.

Taxpayers Protection Alliance

The Taxpayers Protection Alliance is a non-profit advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The group monitors federal spending and issues reports, research, and analyses on spending and taxation it believes to be in excess.
History.
The Taxpayers Protection Alliance (TPA) was founded in 2011 with David Williams as its president (a title he continues to hold as of July 2019). In July 2011 in conjunction with Our Generation, the organization issued a report on the salaries and fringe benefits earned by members of Congress entitled "Are taxpayers getting their money's worth?". In November of that year, the TPA was one of five taxpayer advocacy groups to sign a letter calling for a 10% reduction in pay for Congress members.
In April 2012, the TPA and other groups called on Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, to relinquish his Secret Service protection. Gingrich lost his protection the following week. Over the course of 2013 and 2014, the organization issued reports on topics like the public costs of LEED certification, defense spending, and congressional salaries. The group also began levying criticism against municipal broadband projects using fiber optic cables for connectivity.
In September 2015, the TPA issued a report called "Sacking Taxpayers: How NFL Stadium Subsidies Waste Money and Fall Short on Their Promises of Economic Development" which detailed the amount of money spent by taxpayers on publicly subsidized National Football League stadiums. Later that year, the organization issued a report (in conjunction with the Animal Justice Project) on the taxpayer costs associated with scientific experiments that administer narcotics to animals. The TPA also issued criticisms of the United States Postal Service because it was operating in debt. In 2017, the group started a social media campaign to oppose a proposed municipal broadband project in Louisville, Kentucky, claiming that the cost outweighed the benefits.
In July 2018, TPA president David Williams wrote an open letter to the White House that was critical of the Trump administration's issuance of tariffs as part of the United States' ongoing trade war with China. In April 2019, the organization itself wrote a joint letter (with Tariffs Hurt the Heartland) to Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, condemning the tariffs.

Alice Burr

Alice Burr (American, 1883-1968) was a San Francisco-based photographer associated with the pictorialist movement.
Early life and education.
In 1916, Burr studied at The Clarence H. White School of Photography in New York with White himself, whose 30-week course of study emphasized personal vision and style over any particular school or movement. Burr also attended the California School of Design, where she studied a range of studio arts, including painting, drawing, and printmaking, but it is not known whether she pursued this training prior to her course of study in New York.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Burr, her youngest sister Marian, and two female cousins traveled extensively across Europe, Asia, African continents and to Australia and Japan together.
She lived in the Burr family home on Vallejo Street in San Francisco until her death. Her studio, an Arts and Crafts-style structure built in 1916 solely for her use, was located on an adjacent property.
Work.
Burr primarily made portraits and images of nature, and additionally captured scenes around San Francisco and during her many travels abroad. In her home studio, she experimented with the bromoil and autochrome processes.
Recognition.
In her application to join the San Francisco Society of Women Artists (founded 1877), one of the oldest arts organizations in California, Burr noted that she had exhibited student work at the De Young Museum and at the San Diego Museum of Art.
In 1927, Burr was elected president of the California League of Women Voters.
Burr's accomplishments as a photographer were examined in the 1998 exhibition "Alice Burr: A California Pictorialist Rediscovered" held at the Davison Art Center at Wesleyan University, curated by Thomas Weston Fels with support from Jeanne Slate Overstreet and her late husband Alan Burr Overstreet, the artist's nephew. The exhibition, which traveled to the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery at University of Maryland (2001), California Historical Society (2005) and Santa Barbara Museum of Art (2006), was accompanied by a catalog.
Collections.
Burr's work is held in the following permanent collections:

French ship Foudroyant (1693)

The Foudroyant was a First Rank ship of the line of the French Royal Navy.
Heading.
The name means "Thunderbolt", "lightning"; having an awesome and overwhelming effect.
This ship was originally ordered built at Brest Dockyard on 20 January 1693, and Louis XIV ordered she should bear the name "Soleil Royal" to replace the previous ship bearing that name (destroyed at Cherbourg) in June 1692. The designer and builder was Blaise Pangalo.
However, Étienne Hubac begged the King that that name should be given to the ship ("Foudroyant") he had just build and was then completing instead, because the previous "Soleil Royal" had been built by his own father, Laurent Hubac, and - as he himself had rebuilt that ship from the keel up at Brest in 1689 - he still possessed the moulds for that ship. Moreover, he pointed out to the King that his own ship would be some 4 feet longer and some 200 tons larger than Pangalo's new ship, so would be more deserving of the name that honoured Louis XIV himself. On 1 March 1693, the King agreed to Hubac's proposal and the names of the two ships were exchanged. Pangalo's ship was thus laid down under the name "Foudroyant" in April 1693, launched on 14 November 1693 and completed in 1694.
She was armed with 104 guns, comprising twenty-eight 36-pounders on the lower deck, thirty 18-pounders on the middle deck, twenty-eight 12-pounders on the upper deck, twelve 6-pounders on the quarterdeck and six 6-pounders on the forecastle. In 1706 two extra 12-pounders were added on the upper deck, and two 6-pounders were removed. 
The new ship took part in the Battle of Vélez-Málaga on 24 August 1704, where she was the flagship of "Amiral de France" Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Comte de Toulouse. She was scuttled in Toulon on Louis's orders in July 1707 to avoid being set alight by the bombardment by the English fleet. She was later put back afloat, but in March 1713 she was condemned, and was taken to pieces during 1714.

Francisca Sutil

Francisca Sutil (born 1952) is a Chilean artist. She studied at the Southern Methodist University and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and received her M.F.A in printmaking at the Pratt Institute. Her work has been exhibited widely around the world, most recently her work was shown at the Galería Patricia Ready in Chile and the Art Basel Hong Kong. She is also part of various public collections such as the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C and the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile.
She was the recipient of the Premio de Gráfica at the Bienal internacional de Arte in Valparaiso, Chile and a fellowship for the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C.
She currently lives and works in Santiago, Chile.
Early life and education.
In 1972, Francisca Sutil studied at the School of Art in the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. In 1976, she graduated from in the Bellas Artes, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago. After attending Parson School of Design for a year, she did a seminar at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York. In 1981, she received an M.F.A in Printmaking at the Pratt institute in Brooklyn, New York.
Career and artwork.
Francisca Sutil began her art career in the late 1970s making flat, paper cast work. Her strong interest in technical processes has led her work to evolve and change many times. She has worked in printmaking, papermaking and painting but her style and appreciation for meaning has remained constant throughout her career. Her well-crafted, abstract artwork reflects her love and understanding of process and materiality and alludes to high modernist abstraction and influences from artists like Jackson Pollock, Morris Louis and Ellsworth Kelly.
At the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Sutil learned that she was more attracted to printmaking than painting. Sutil was always questioning her surroundings and her curiosity led her to engage in classical methods but approach them in unusual ways. Sutil would place flat objects one on top of the other to convey depth and light in her work. Her interest in printmaking induced her to conceive her series "Evolución," for which she worked with screen-printing using oil paint instead of ink. Using these non-traditional methods allowed her to explore the concepts of the mental and spiritual evolution of men.
Sutil moved to New York in the late 70's to study printmaking at Pratt. It was there where she discovered papermaking and mastered the process. From the late 1970s to mid 1980s, Sutil was making sculptural abstract works out of cast paper. Her deep interest in printmaking and paper making has kept her close to all types of papers. For Sutil, paper acted not only as a surface for her work, but also as a structure that was part of her work.
In 1986, Francisca Sutil began using oil pastels on her hand made paper, after two years she fully committed to painting with pigmented gesso but soon after, in the 90's, watercolor, Chinese ink and oils. Her series "Space" consisted of vertical lines on paper one after the other, the gesso did not have the correct consistency and did not work with this type of technique.
In 2006, after an exhausting time in which she had to prepare for a big retrospective at the Bellas Artes Museum of Art and a monograph on her work, Francisca Sutil decided to take a year long trip to Europe in which she traveled all around the country absorbing the origins of Western Painting and Art of the XIII- XVIII centuries.
After a year of traveling she decided to begin working with paint, this medium would allow her to examine her deep- seated questions about the relationship between materials. Her travels reflected on many of her following artworks such as "Interludios." In these works, colors that she had never used appeared, the size was reduced and composition changed creating more intimate works that displayed all the knowledge she gained from her one-year abroad.
For her next big series, "Mute," Sutil marks a new phase in her career. Her new technique consists of loading a brush with ink or paint and placing it down on paper many times, this method creates an oval shaped mark that repeats continuously in lines going down the paper. Her new technique is reminiscent of "palotes", a technique used in schools to teach children how to write. Like "palotes", Sutil's oval shaped marks are placed one after the other, requiring time and concentration and creating all different final pieces. The colors she uses are mostly gray, black and white but in each work Sutil manages to make the colors stand out and look contrasted, conveying a chiaroscuro effect without the traditional methods and techniques. Many critics have thought about it as a metaphor for passing time, others see it as an act of prayer.
Awards.
Francisca Sutil has been the recipient to various awards, fellowships and grants throughout her long career.
Starting in 1972, she received a fellowship from the Southern Methodist university school of art in Dallas Texas. In 1976, she received a prize for the Drawing category from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile in Santiago. A year later, 1977, she received a graphic prize for the Bienal Internacional de Arte in Valparaiso, Chile. In 1980, she received a fellowship from the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. In 1981, she received the NEA from the Drawing Center (Paper Conservation) in New York. she was awarded the EMF from the Artists Space in New York in 183 and in 1992 she received an award from the Fondo de Cultura y Desarolo de las Artes in Santiago Chile.
Most recently she was awarded, in 2016, Best Exhibition of the Year for "The Will of Silence" by the Circle of Chilean Art Critics and in 2017, she received the Marco Bontá Prize from the Academia Chilena de Bellas Artes in Chile.
Solo exhibitions.
Francisca Sutil has had many one- person exhibitions, most recently she showed, "Alquimia/Alchemy" in 2006 in Santiago, Chile. In 2007, "Resonance" showed at Nohra Haime Gallery in New York. In 2010 she showed at the Galería Animal, "Interludio," “Muestra Chaco," "Arte Contemporáneo y Fe," at the Sala Blanca Centro de Extension UC. In 2011, "Mute" at the Sala Gasco Arte Contemporaneo in Santiago. In 2012, she showed at the Nohra Haime Gallery, a show called "Interlude" and a year later she showed "Mute," at the same place. In 2015, she showed "Chaco" at the Galería Patricia Ready, and in 2016 she showed at the same gallery, "Obra En Papel" and at Art Basel in Hong Kong.

Deposed Crown Princess Bong

Crown Princess Sun of the Haeum Bong clan (순빈 봉씨, 純嬪 奉氏; 1414 – ?) was the second wife of Crown Prince Yi Hyang, later Munjong of Joseon. She was banished after it was discovered that she was sleeping with one of her handmaids.
Biography.
Lady Bong became the Crown Princess (;) in 1429, a few months after her predecessor, Crown Princess Hwi, was thrown out of the palace for witchcraft.
Apparently, Crown Prince Yi Hyang did not favor her, which made her incredibly angry. She reportedly took her husband's clothing and female clothing from the palace to send to her natal home, which breached etiquette.
When Consort Gwon became pregnant, Crown Princess Sun apparently complained to the palace women that she would be dismissed in favor of Gwon, and she frequently cried. Her complaints became known throughout the palace and King Sejong scolded her that she should be happy that another concubine was pregnant when she was not. Sejong also scolded the Crown Prince that his concubine was pregnant but his official wife had no children, after which he spent more time with her.
Later, Crown Princess Sun reportedly became pregnant, but miscarried and buried the remains. However, when servants were sent to retrieve the child's remains, they found only empty burial clothes.
Demotion.
The court records of 1436 note that Crown Princess Sun apparently also sent surplus food from palace meals to her natal home, spied on people outside of her palace through a gap in the wall of the servant's toilet, and received a visit from her aunt's husband after her father's death without notifying the Crown Prince, which, they said, showed a lack of regard for the general good.
The consort was also accused of being over intimate with So-ssang (소쌍), one of her maids and a member of the slave class. The two were described as inseparable and So-ssang reportedly slept with her mistress. When Crown Prince Hyang had questioned why her maid slept with her, the consort responded that she loved him, but he didn't love her. So-ssang later told the court how Crown Princess Sun had invited her to lie down with her, whilst the other maids slept outside. Though So-ssang initially declined, the consort insisted, and So-ssang eventually undressed and went behind the screen where her mistress took off her remaining clothes and forced her to lie next to her 'as if with a man'. Crown Princess Sun then told the court that she was intimate with So-ssang night and day, as well as with another servant called Dan-ji (단지), because it solved the fact that she slept alone.
Upon hearing that Crown Princess Sun had been intimate with a member of the nobi class, King Sejong consulted with various officials on demoting another of the Crown Prince's consorts. The officials supported the motion to depose her, and the Princess Sun was demoted to commoner and banished. The decree for her dismissal, however, excluded any mention of her sleeping with her maid and focused instead on her sending palace supplies to her natal home and receiving visitors without her husband's knowledge.

Mark Hamister

Mark Hamister (October 18, 1951 – August 20, 2021) was an American businessman and the Chairman and CEO of the Hamister Group, a Buffalo-based company specializing in hotels and assisted living residences with more than 500 employees and $80 million in annual revenues.
He was the founder and owner of three professional indoor football teams: the Buffalo Destroyers of the Arena Football League (1998-2003), and the Rochester Brigade (2001–03) and Cincinnati Swarm (2003) of the minor-league arenafootball2.
Upon the arrest of Buffalo Sabres CEO/Owner John Rigas and his sons for fraud in May 2002, and the subsequent bankruptcy of the Adelphia Corporation, Hamister and fellow investor Todd Berman submitted a bid to the National Hockey League to purchase the Sabres franchise. Although their bid was initially approved by the league in November 2002, Berman subsequently withdrew his financial support and Hamister suspended the asset purchase agreement that would have completed the sale of the team. The Sabres were eventually purchased by Thomas Golisano, founder and CEO of Paychex Inc.
In his later years, Hamister was instrumental in a $300 million private and public development project in the suburban Town of Amherst NY.
Hamister died on August 20, 2021, from COVID-19.

Okinawa SV

 is a football (soccer) club based in Uruma, which is located in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. They play in the Kyushu Soccer League, which is part of Japanese Regional Leagues.
History.
After leaving SC Sagamihara and professional football, former Japan NT member Naohiro Takahara opted to found a new club in Okinawa. The name took inspiration from Hamburger SV, a former German club in Takahara's career: this inspired "Okinawa Sport-Verein" (a German term for "sports club") and the kit's colours and design are inspired by other club from his career, the Argentinian Boca Juniors.
Takahara set himself as president, manager-player and captain, helping the side from Kyushu to start from the bottom of Japanese football. In their first year, Okinawa SV featured in the third division of Okinawa Prefectural League, marking an incredible debut: all matches were won and they scored 123 goals. Okinawa Football Association opted to give OSV a free pass to join the first division of the prefectural championship. In their second season, Okinawa SV got promoted again, this time to Kyushu Soccer League.

Derek Kraus

Derek K. Kraus (born September 1, 2001) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He competes full-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 19 Toyota Tundra for McAnally-Hilgemann Racing. The Stratford, Wisconsin native is also a former NASCAR Next member and the 2019 NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West Champion.
Racing career.
Early years.
Kraus started racing in go-karts and bandoleros. He won the GSR Kartway championship in 2012 and 2013. Kraus also competed in bandoleros at State Park Speedway in 2013 and won the track championship. In 2014, he won the State Park and state bandeleros championships. He later moved up to Midwest trucks and super late models (SLMs). He began the 2015 season by competing in seven Super Late Model races in Florida's New Smyrna Speedway. He began racing in the American Ethanol SuperTruck Series in 2015; he became the youngest driver to win a feature at Rockford Speedway at age 13. Additionally, Kraus won his first SLM race a few days before he turned fourteen. He also competed full-time in the Midwest Truck Series, he won that series' 2015 championship. In 2016, he competed in the ARCA Midwest Tour, finishing fourth in the standings and surpassing Matt Kenseth as the youngest driver to win a race in the series.
NASCAR.
2017: K&amp;N Pro Series.
In January 2017, it was announced that Kraus would drive full-time in the 2017 NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West for Bill McAnally Racing (BMR), driving the team's No. 19 Toyota Camry. The announcement came after Kraus tested for the team at Kern County Raceway Park earlier that year.
Kraus made his debut for BMR in a NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East race at New Smyrna Speedway in February, where he finished third. He set career-best finishes in the West Series of second at Kern County, Spokane County Raceway, and Colorado National Speedway. He won the pole at Iowa Speedway, his first combination race between the K&amp;N Pro Series East and West. Kraus led for an extended period at Meridian Speedway in Idaho and won the season's final race at Kern County for his first win, beating teammate and series champion Todd Gilliland. He also won the K&amp;N West Rookie of the Year award in 2017.
2018: K&amp;N contender, Truck debut.
Kraus began 2018 by competing in the Winter Showdown late model race at Kern County. He won the season-opening 2018 K&amp;N Pro Series West race at Kern County after making contact with race leader Kevin Harvick on the final restart, giving the lead to teammate Cole Rouse in the process. Kraus later passed the fellow BMR driver while both were running in lapped traffic, taking the win. Kraus then won the pole in both races at the series' doubleheader at Tucson Speedway, finishing fourth and eleventh in the first and second races respectively. In May 2018, Kraus was named to the 2018 NASCAR Next class. At Douglas County Speedway, Kraus won his third career race, leading teammate Hailie Deegan to a 1-2 finish for BMR. At Evergreen Speedway, Kraus won the pole and led a majority of the race but ran out of fuel in the closing stages of the race, losing to Derek Thorn. In the series' next race, a combination race with the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East at Gateway Motorsports Park, Kraus passed Rouse on the final restart to secure his third victory of the season. At the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Dirt Track, he led 31 laps but spun in the later stages and retired from the race, dropping to 17th in the classification order. At Meridian Speedway, Kraus led the first 189 laps before slowing to avoid a spinning lapped car in a late caution, leading to a third-place finish. For the final West race of the season, the tour returned to Kern County Raceway, and Kraus won after a late-race restart. He finished the season-long points tally in fourth, behind Thorn, Ryan Partridge and Rouse.
Kraus' racing schedule with BMR expanded in 2018 to include a foray into the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East. After finishing fourth in the season opener at New Smyrna Speedway, Kraus finished 24th in the next race at Bristol Motor Speedway. He then won the pole at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in July. It was later announced that Kraus would join DGR-Crosley for the last two East races on the calendar. In his first race with DGR, he again claimed the pole at New Hampshire. Kraus raced against Brandon McReynolds for the lead on the final restart, finishing in second. He would end the season with a third-place finish in the season finale at Dover.
On November 6, 2018, Kraus announced that he would make his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut at ISM Raceway that Friday, driving the No. 19 Toyota Tundra for Bill McAnally Racing. He both qualified for and finished the race in the eighth position.
2019: K&amp;N championship, part-time in Trucks.
Kraus returned to BMR for a third West season in 2019. He also planned to run some K&amp;N East races. Kraus began 2019 by winning the New Smyrna 175 K&amp;N East race. After finishing sixth at Bristol, Kraus was three points out of the championship points lead. Addressing his unclear K&amp;N East schedule, Kraus commented, "If we're leading, we're going to race three." Kraus competed in the third and fourth races in South Boston, winning the second race in the doubleheader. Kraus was leading the East Series championship in July, and team owner Bill McAnally reaffirmed the team's commitment to run full-time in the East as long as Kraus was at the top of the standings. After a ninth-place finish at Watkins Glen International, Kraus and BMR were more than ten points out of the lead and subsequently withdrew from the second race at Bristol, conceding the East Series championship.
In the West Series, Kraus began the season at the Dirt Track at Las Vegas with a sixth-place finish. He qualified second and was leading the field until getting shuffled back with around 30 laps remaining. He later won both races at Tucson Speedway's doubleheader event, leading all 100 laps in the first race. At Colorado, Kraus ran up front until a broken sway bar hindered his car's performance, dropping him down to the back of the top-five. After returning to the lead, Deegan collided with him on the final lap, resulting in Kraus finishing eighth after having spun out. Before the next K&amp;N West race at Sonoma, Kraus ran a one-off Trans-Am Series race at the California road course, a race in which he would go on to win the pole and score the overall victory. At Douglas County Speedway, Kraus won the pole and led every lap en route to the win. His next win of the season was at Meridian Speedway, where he led 100 laps after racing Jagger Jones for the victory throughout the event and colliding with him late in the race, spinning Jones out. Kraus won again by leading every lap from the pole at Kern County, his fourth straight victory at the track. Kraus' position in points enabled him to clinch the K&amp;N West championship simply by starting the final race at ISM Raceway, where he finished third and was crowned champion of the series.
Kraus and BMR also re-upped for four Truck Series events in 2019, at Martinsville and Dover in the early portion of the season and Las Vegas and ISM in the latter portion of the season. After finishing 18th at Martinsville, he equalled his best finish for the series with an eighth at Dover. At Las Vegas, Kraus's truck had transmission problems, relegating him to a 27th-place finish. After winning the K&amp;N West championship, BMR added a fifth Truck Series race for Kraus at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
2020–present: Full-time in the Truck Series.
On January 13, 2020, Bill McAnally Racing announced the formation of McAnally-Hilgemann Racing, a partnership with businessman and fellow Stratford native Bill Hilgemann, to field the No. 19 Tundra full-time in the Truck Series for Kraus. He began the season at Daytona International Speedway with a career-best fourth-place finish. At Darlington, Kraus nearly scored his first career win, finishing second to Ben Rhodes in an overtime finish. Kraus returned to the team in 2021, but had a new crew chief in Matt Noyce, who moved over from ThorSport Racing No. 99 truck of Ben Rhodes. His previous crew chief, Kevin Bellicourt, left McAnally to crew chief the No. 77 Spire Motorsports car in the Cup Series.
Personal life.
Kraus attended Stratford High School and was on the school's wrestling team and also played football his freshman year. He graduated high school in 2020 and missed his graduation ceremony, which was rescheduled to July due to COVID-19, to race in the truck race at Kansas on the same day. After that, he moved from Wisconsin to Charlotte, North Carolina, where most NASCAR teams are based.
His father, Mark, raced super late models in the 2000s.

Klondex Mines

Klondex Mines was a North American gold-mining company, based in Reno, Nevada and Vancouver, British Columbia. It had three operating mines in Nevada and one in Manitoba. and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE American. In March 2018, it was acquired by Hecla Mining.
History.
Klondex Mines was founded in 1975, through the spinoff of the Fire Creek Project in Nevada from Placer Development. Until 2012, Klondex was principally engaged in exploration of its Fire Creek Project. It attempted to sell this project to several suitors in the 2000s, but was not successful in doing so.
In 2011, a dissident shareholder group successfully proposed a new board of directors. In September 2012, the current CEO, Paul Huet, took control, as the result of another proxy battle. Huet had experience with the company, as part of previous teams examining the possibility of buying its Fire Creek project. At that time, the company was in dire financial straits. 
In February 2014, the company bought the Midas mine and mill in Nevada from Newmont Mining for US$83 million. Huet had experience with the mine, having previously been the mine manager for seven years. In January 2016, the company purchased the Rice Lake gold mine (also called the True North mine) in Manitoba for US$32 million, from creditors. Also in 2016, it purchased the Hollister mine in Nevada for US$80 million.
In 2018, the company laid off 90 employees at its True North mine, as the result of disappointing production in 2017. Production was only about 25,000 ounces, as opposed to the expected 50,000 ounces.
In March 2018, the company was acquired for US$462 million by Hecla Mining. At the same time, Klondex's Canadian assets (principally the True North mine) were spun out into a new entity, Klondex Canada, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
Operations.
Klondex had four operating mines, with total 2017 production of about 220,000 gold-equivalent ounces. Its four mines were

Clinton railway station (formerly known as Golding railway station) serves the Clinton coal loading wharf in the north of the suburb ().
History.
In January 1847 Colonel George Barney led a settlement party from Sydney to Port Curtis to establish the short-lived Colony of North Australia. They travelled in the 628-ton barque Lord Auckland which was built in Calcutta in 1836. The ship stranded on a shoal in Port Curtis on 25 January 1847, but was refloated and repaired in a creek, now known as Auckland Creek. Auckland Inlet is also named after the barque.
The suburb takes its name from the railway station which was assigned in August 1967 by Queensland Railways Department to their locomotive servicing facility, using an Aboriginal word (probably from a New South Wales area), meaning "plenty of hills".
In the Callemondah had a population of 18 people.
Education.
There are no schools in Callemondah. The nearest government primary schools are Gladstone Central State School in neighbouring Gladstone Central to the east and Gladstone West State School in neighbouring West Gladstone to the south-east.

Sheppey Cliffs and Foreshore

Sheppey Cliffs and Foreshore is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest which stretches between Minster and Leysdown-on-Sea in Kent. It includes five Geological Conservation Review sites. This site exposes Eocene London Clay with well-preserved fossil fauna and flora, which have been studied since the eighteenth century. 
The SSSI.
London clay was deposited in a shallow sea forming beds up to deep at the eastern end. Up to five cycles of deposition, each followed by shallowing of the sea, have been found. Each cycle begins with coarser material being laid down, and this was followed by clay which became increasingly sandy. These layers have been labelled A to E (with A being the oldest), and at Sheppey, the layers C to E are exposed on the cliffs and foreshore. Each layer has its own flora and fauna, with well-preserved fossils of invertebrates including bivalve and gastropod molluscs, brachiopods and nautiloids, as well as articulated lobsters and crabs, and sometimes insects.
There is also a range of fossils of sharks, rays and bony fish, reptiles and birds. Some of the bones occur in nodules in the clay, and much material has been washed out onto the beach. Turtles, crocodiles and snakes are represented among the reptiles, and the birds include members of sixteen families. Sheppey cliffs are also a rich palaeobotany site. Many fossils of Eocene plants have been found, mostly from layers D and E, and over 300 species have been recorded. Dominant among them are tropical lianas; the habitat seems to have been a lush forest bordering a warm, shallow sea.
Ecology.
The site is botanically important for the dragon's teeth ("Tetragonolobus maritimus") which is found in only a few locations in Britain, and several other uncommon plants occur here, one being bithynian vetch ("Vicia bithynica").

1932 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1932 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 8, 1932, as part of the 1932 United States presidential election. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background and vote.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
The previous election of 1928 had seen many Protestant ministers in this state stand strongly opposed to Catholic Democratic nominee Al Smith, with the result that Republican candidate Herbert Hoover was able to gain considerable support in the largely white but secessionist upcountry. However, unlike in Alabama, where Hoover nearly carried the state due to Thomas Heflin supporting him over Smith, in Georgia no local Democrats supported Hoover.
The onset of the Great Depression completely destroyed any hope of building on the gains from anti-Catholicism and growing urban middle class presidential Republican voting which had been seen since 1920. In fact, Hoover fell far below typical Republican percentages from before the 1920s, and Roosevelt won more than ninety percent of ballots in Georgia as a whole and in all but twenty-two of the state’s 159 counties. His performance is the best in Georgia by any presidential candidates since Andrew Jackson won the state uncontested exactly a century previously.

Postmodernity and Its Discontents

Postmodernity and Its Discontents is a book written by Zygmunt Bauman, published in 1997. It is considered a landmark in Bauman's studies on postmodernism. The title references Sigmund Freud's 1930 book "Civilization and Its Discontents".
Overview.
In his work, Bauman references Sigmund Freud's 1930 book "Civilization and Its Discontents" in the title, which was concerned with repression.
He posits that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed the "modern" tradeoff espoused by Freud in his "Civilization and Its Discontents", that freedom was given up in exchange for security and order. In Bauman's view of the postmodern society, the 'will to happiness' is a sacrificing of security. Security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase and consume with a sense of constant uncertainty. It establishes a new category of "strangers" who are excluded from society.

Carl Sentance

Carl Sentance (born 28 June 1961 in Loughborough) is an English rock singer and current vocalist for Nazareth.
He began his career as the singer for Persian Risk. In 1986, as Persian Risk disbanded, he was recruited by Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to front the Geezer Butler Band but the group ultimately failed to score a record deal. In 1990, he was sought out by Welsh guitarist Paul Chapman of Lone Star, UFO, and Waysted fame to front a new band, Ghost, in Orlando, Florida. It too never got off the ground properly and was mostly ignored by the industry (although an archives release was put together posthumously by Chapman). Sentance also assembled an American version of Persian Risk with guitarist Mark Lanoue; the band gigged in the Southern US area until their demise in 1995. Back in the UK, the singer was involved in a project with members of Wraith before being asked to front legendary Swiss hard rockers Krokus in 1998; he appeared on their "Round 13" album and stayed on for the next three years. In 2005, Sentance emerged fronting Whole Lotta Metal alongside co-vocalist Tony Martin of Black Sabbath fame and other British metal session musicians, assembled for a touring cast of cover versions. The singer also served as the voice for the Power Project who issued the "Dinosaurs" album in 2006. It featured Sentance and veteran US musicians Carlos Cavazo (Quiet Riot, Ratt), Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Dio, Foreigner), and Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath, Dio). On the live front, the singer teamed up with Deep Purple's Don Airey &amp; Friends and can also be heard on Airey's 2008 solo effort, "A Light in the Sky", and also on Airey´s 2008 album, "One of a Kind", where he is the lead vocalist on all songs. Sentance issued his debut solo album, "Mind Doctor", in 2008; musical guests include Airey on keyboards and the Thunder rhythm section of Harry James and Chris Childs.
Sentance became the lead vocalist for Nazareth in 2015.

2018 Cotton Bowl Classic

The 2018 Cotton Bowl Classic was a college football bowl game played on December 29, 2018, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The 83rd Cotton Bowl Classic was a College Football Playoff semifinal with the winner to compete in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. It was one of the 2018–19 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the game was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic.
Teams.
The game featured second-ranked Clemson of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) against third-ranked Notre Dame, an FBS independent. This was the first time that the two programs met in a bowl game; their more recent regular season meeting had been in 2015, won by Clemson. The only prior Cotton Bowl to feature two undefeated teams had been the 1948 edition, which ended in a 13–13 tie between Penn State and SMU.
Clemson Tigers.
Clemson defeated Pitt in the 2018 ACC Championship Game on December 1, then received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The Tigers entered the bowl with a 13–0 record (8–0 in conference). On December 27, it was confirmed that three Clemson players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, would be suspended from playing in the game by the NCAA, due to drug testing showing "trace amounts of a banned substance", which was identified as ostarine.
This was Clemson's second Cotton Bowl bid in school history, following its appearance in the 1940 edition. It was also the first Cotton Bowl appearance by an active ACC member since Maryland's appearance in the 1977 edition.
Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
Notre Dame received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The independent Fighting Irish entered the bowl with a 12–0 record. This was Notre Dame's first Cotton Bowl berth since the 1994 edition and its eighth overall.

Harperley railway station

Harperley railway station served the Harperley Hall Estate and the nearby hamlet of Low Harperley, close to the village of Fir Tree in County Durham, North East England between 1861 and 1864 and again from 1892 to 1953 as a stop on the Wear Valley Line.
History.
The Wear Valley Company opened their line from the Bishop Auckland &amp; Weardale Railway at Witton Junction to on 3 August 1847 but initially, no station was provided in this rural location. In March 1861, the Frosterley &amp; Stanhope Railway opened a small halt to serve Harperley Hall and its estate as part of works to extended the Wear Valley Line from Frosterley to , a project that was completed the following year. However, because the station was built primarily to serve the Hall, it was located at the end of a private estate road with little public access and thus was closed in May 1864. A new, enlarged station, with sidings on either side of the tracks, was opened by the North Eastern Railway (NER) at Harperley on 1 November 1892 to serve a local ganister and timber contractor. On 21 October 1895, the NER extended the Stanhope line to .
The line was double track through Harperley (to enable trains to pass) and this was controlled from a signal box, adjacent to the level crossing carrying the estate road across the line.
During WWII, a prisoner of war camp was constructed nearby, perhaps as a result of the remote location with good rail links.
The station was closed to passengers by British Railways (BR) on 29 June 1953 and goods on 1O October 1955, though goods traffic continued to pass through the station for some years. In 1961 the line was cut back to and then, in 1968, it was further reduced to the Blue Circle Cement Works (later owned by Lafarge), just to the west of . Though stopping goods trains had been withdrawn completely, the line was retained to serve the cement works and, in 1988, BR introduced a summer Sunday extension to the regular to 'Heritage Line' service to Stanhope though no stop was provided at Harperley and the service was withdrawn after the summer of 1992 along with the freight on 17 March 1993.
Rather than close the line when freight traffic was withdrawn, BR mothballed it and a campaign began in 1993 to preserve the line as a heritage railway. Weardale Railways Limited purchased the line in 2004 and reopened it between and Stanhope in July 2004. However the organisation struggled financially and the service was suspended a short time later, not recommencing until August 2006.
After major efforts to clear the line of vegetation and repair damaged tracks, passenger services along the section between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland West through (but not stopping at) Harperley were reintroduced on 23 May 2010 and continued until the end of the 2012 season. However, in June 2014 a limited, volunteer-run passenger service was reintroduced between Stanhope and Wolsingham using a class 122 "Bubble Car" and on 27 March 2016 this service was extended to . However this service does not stop at Harperley and there do not currently appear to be any plans to reopen the station.

Rabochaya Mysl

Rabochaya Mysl (, "Workers' Thought") was a Russian social-democrat newspaper and bearer of the Economist current.
Sixteen numbers were published in total. The first two numbers were released in Saint Petersburg in October and December 1897. In Berlin, the following nine issues were published, from 1898 to April 1901, followed by four other numbers released in Warsaw. The last number was published in December 1902, in Geneva.
The most influential editor was Konstantin Tachtarev (1871–1925). Other collaborators were Apollinariya Yakubova (1869–1917), Nikolai Lochov (1872–1948), Vladimir Ivanshin (1869–1904) and Karl August Kok.
History.
The founders of the newspaper were a group of Kolpino, an industrial suburb of Saint Petersburg, formed by the workers Jakov Andreev (1873–1927), the two Dulashev brothers, Efimov, Vlasov, Vetts, and by the employees Fel'dman, Vaneev and Ivanov. A group of workers from Obukhovo, a district of the capital, also joined the initiative. The workers of Kolpino had been formed politically at the school of some adherents of the Narodnaya Volya that resided there. After the newspaper's creation, they formed a circle called the "Fight Organization", which some Obukhovo workers also joined.
Semenov, one of the latter, described a few years later the nature of the workers' organization: «The organization had to be purely manual, autonomous, independent of the intelligentsia" because they believed that the emancipation of the workers should be the exclusive task of the workers themselves, and the interference of intellectuals could "pollute the purity of the workers' movement".
Their propaganda and agitation did not touch on political but exclusively economic themes, simply because "we did not understand the political struggle and interpreted it in a trade-unionistic way". According to Semenov, they were unknowingly influenced from the so-called "legal Marxism" of Peter Struve and Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, which led them to Bernstein's revisionism and to the economism of Yekaterina Kuskova and Sergei Prokopovich.
On the characteristics of the circle and the newspaper, reported years after by Andreev:
An article in the first issue denounced the current weakness of the workers' movement, at the "mercy of tsarism" and unable to fight "against the despotism of capitalists and the government" until it was established in "a compact force, the conscious strength of autonomy of the working class". This force should have been achieved by means of a "workers' box", the only support that would have made the movement's activity possible.
At that point the worker could have assumed "the responsibility of his own destiny, taking it from the hands of his bosses". The columnist believed that politics always "economically follow the economy and that ultimately the limitations and constraints proper to politics are relaxed during this process", and from this consideration he deduced for the labor movement the primary need to conduct an economic struggle.
During 1896–1897, a long series of strikes forced the government to grant, on 16 June 1897, the law that lowered the duration of the working day to 11.5 hours. Commenting on those facts, the 7th issue of "Rabochaya Mysl" (July 1899) wrote that "a struggle of that kind, the struggle for the reduction of the working day, is a political struggle and constitutes an effective example of class consciousness".
Similar reductions in the politics of trade union struggles were theorized in other issues of the newspaper. In number 11 (April 1901) it was written to fight "above all for the freedom of strike, of association and assembly, for the individual liberties of speech and of press, since these freedoms will facilitate the increase of our wages and the reduction of the working day".
In order to conduct these battles, a political party was apparently not necessary, as it was not included among the means indicated in the 4th issue of the newspaper (October 1898) to "move the movement forward". Among the list of means were: strikes for wage increases and reductions in hours, «unions of secret workers and mutual aid», trade unions and workers' associations «structured according to the regulations of the Ministry of Interior», associations of consumers, educational and recreational centers, the union of fights for emancipation, journals and books «approved by the censorship» and even declarations printed in clandestine print shops.
Because of the criticism received by Vladimir Lenin and Georgi Plekhanov, in 1900, Konstantin Tachtarev proposed that Plekhanov take over the direction of the newspaper. Plekhanov subordinated his acceptance to the consent of Lenin, who declared himself against it. As he wrote to Apollinariya Yakubova, "the inevitable divergences, substantial and not secondary, with the positions of the editors of the "Rabochaya Mysl" would only bring confusion in the social-democratic movement".
Positions similar to those of "Rabochaya Mysl" were carried forward by the newspaper "Rabocheye Delo" (, "The Workers' Cause"), founded in Geneva in April 1899 as the organ of the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad. The latter newspaper ceased publication in February 1902, ten months before "Rabochaya Mysl".

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, sold under the brand name Biktarvy, is a fixed-dose combination antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. One tablet, taken orally once daily, contains 50mg bictegravir, 200mg emtricitabine, and 25mg tenofovir alafenamide. It was approved for use in the United States in February 2018, and for use in the European Union in June 2018.
Combination therapy.
Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is an example of a combination drug that can be taken as a complete regimen for treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus.
Combination therapy for HIV, often called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), is composed of two or more types of antiretroviral drugs. Combination therapy decreases the likelihood that drug resistance will occur, because it is unlikely that the HIV-1 strains will be able to mutate enough to become resistant to all drugs being used in the combination. Combination therapy increases the length of lives of patients with HIV-1, and can greatly reduce the possibility for transmission of the virus.
Components.
Bictegravir (BIC) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Bictegravir is different from other INSTIs because it contains a bridged bicyclic ring and a distinct benzyl tail with a 2,4,6-trifluorobenzyl group. This contributes to an increase in plasma protein binding and a reduction of activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). These changes minimize interactions between drugs, lower clearance, and increase solubility. Bictegravir was found to be less drug resistant than other drugs in the same class.
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is a synthetic fluoro derivative of thiacytidine. Within the cell, emtricitabine becomes phosphorylated, which forms emitricitabine 5'-triphosphate within the cell. This allows for the drug to compete with the viral and host substrate and ultimately causes a termination of DNA chain elongation. Underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV) can interact with emtricitabine to cause significant liver damage, but it does not have a significant detrimental effect on the liver when given to patients without HBV.
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir that functions as a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Other prodrugs for tenofovir have been tested, but TAF is more efficient at refining HIV-1 therapy. It converts intracellularly to TFV diphosphate, which is a metabolite in HIV target cells. Thus, TAF has higher active metabolite concentrations and lower plasma TFV than other Tenovir prodrugs. TAF is metabolized primarily with the kidneys, and has a lower dosage than other prodrugs, so it is less detrimental to the renal elimination system.
Medical uses.
This drug regimen is intended and approved for adults with HIV-1 infection who have had no previous antiretroviral treatment or for those with less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL. Patients with HIV-1 should not have previously had any adverse reactions or resistance to bictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide.
Side effects.
This drug should not be co-administered with dofetilide or rifampin. Dofetilide when taken with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide can cause an increase in dofetilide plasma concentrations, which can lead to death. Rifampin and bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide when taken together can decrease bictegravir plasma concentrations and cause resistance to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Other HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs should not be taken with this therapy.
If kidney disease or development of renal impairment is seen, the drug should be discontinued. Discontinuation of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in patients with hepatitis B and HIV-1 has been shown to increase the prevalence of hepatitis B, causing liver decompensation and liver failure
Adverse drug reactions include, but are not limited to, diarrhea, nausea, and headache.

Crit'air

The French Crit'air air quality certificate () is a vignette (a secure sticker) issued to show a vehicle's compliance with European emission standards.
"Crit'air" covers all road vehicles, including motorcycles, quad bikes, private cars, vans, trucks, coaches and buses.
Under the Law on Energy Transition for Green Growth, local councils are allowed to provide benefits only to less polluting vehicles, and vignettes enable them to be identified. The system also allows urban areas to restrict the use of the more polluting vehicles, either at all times, or when pollution levels are high.
"Crit'air" was developed by the French Ministry of the Environment in collaboration with the French Ministry of the Interior to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.
Drivers are required to place the vignette on the inside of the lower-right hand corner of their windscreen; different colour vignettes indicate different emissions classes.
The vignettes can be ordered online for payment of a small fee, currently €3.11 plus postage, after submission of a copy of the vehicle registration certificate for verification of the emissions class. Many third party sellers also provide online services for ordering "Crit'air" vignettes, typically for €20-30.
Categories.
There six different coloured vignettes, relating to six categories. The category in which a vehicle falls depends on the engine type (electric, hydrogen, petrol or diesel) and the European emission standard (Euro standard). Where the emission standard is not recorded, the date of first registration is used instead to determine a category. The categories are not based on actual technical measurement of the vehicle in question.
Environmental zones.
France has two types of zone that have emissions-related traffic restrictions. Both are enforced by the use of the "Crit'air" vignettes.
ZCR.
In a "" (ZCR) there is a permanent requirement for vehicles to display "Crit'air" vignettes, and certain classes of vehicle are always prohibited from driving within the zone.
ZPA.
In a "zone de protection de l'air" (ZPA), which tends to be significantly larger than the ZCR zones, traffic is only restricted by public announcement at times of high air pollution; and all vehicles must display a vignette at those times.
If a ZPA applies to an entire "département" then it is termed a ZPAd ().

Paul E. Marik

Paul Ellis Marik (26 March 1958) is a professor of medicine and serves as chair of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia. His research interests include sepsis and tissue oxygenation. Marik has called himself a "status quo destabilizer".
Early life and education.
Marik was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He received his medical degree from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
Career.
Marik did a critical care fellowship in London, Ontario, Canada, and subsequently has worked in the United States in teaching hospitals since 1992.
In 2001 Marik was author of the book "Handbook of Evidence Based Critical Care" published by Springer-Verlag. From 2002 to 2006 Marik was part of the Editorial Board of "Chest" journal.
In 2005 Marik was named Director at the Division Pulmonary and Critical Care at Jefferson Medical College (JMC) and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
In 2011, an international committee assembled by the main thoracic and respiratory national societies published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The guidelines' section on the treatment of complications relied in part on the results of Marik's 2001 research on the association of gastric reflux and aspiration. 
In 2012, an international committee updated guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock. In its section of supportive therapy recommendations, the committee based its concept on blood product administrations partly on research performed by Marik and W. Sibbald in 1993.
Marik is inventor of the "Marik protocol", also known as the "HAT" protocol, which proposes a combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine as a treatment for preventing sepsis for people in intensive care. Marik's own initial research, published in 2017, showed a dramatic evidence of benefit, leading to the protocol becoming popular among intensive care physicians, especially after the protocol received attention on social media and National Public Radio, drawing criticism of science by press conference from the wider medical community. Subsequent independent research failed to replicate Marik's positive results, indicating the possibility that they had been compromised by bias. A systematic review of trials in 2021 found that the claimed benefits of the protocol could not be confirmed.
Marik is a co-founder of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), a group of physicians and former journalists formed in April 2020 that has advocated for ineffective COVID-19 treatments, including the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin.
Marik was lead author of a journal article on the efficacy of ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, which had been provisionally accepted for publication by a Frontiers Media journal in early 2021, but which was subsequently rejected on account of what the publisher said were "a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance" meaning that the article did "not offer an objective [or] balanced scientific contribution to the evaluation of ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19".
In March 2021, Marik was reprimanded by the Virginia Board of Medicine and ordered to complete additional education in prescribing practices after it was found he had prescribed drugs, including phenobarbital, oxycodone, tramadol, alprazolam, and diazepam, to people who were not his patients.
Marik has written over 450 peer reviewed journal articles.

Genderqueer fashion

Genderqueer fashion is fashion among genderqueer and nonbinary people that goes beyond common style conventions that usually associate certain colors and shapes with one of the two binary genders. Genderqueer fashion aims to be perceived by consumers as a fashion style that focuses on experimenting garments based on people's different body shapes instead of following the restrictions given by gendered clothing categorization.
Genderqueer style.
Genderqueer style is the expression of an identity that does not conform to typical cultural and societal norms of gender through the expression of fashion, typically through the combination of (though not always) clothing and accessories originally designed for men and/or women. Though the impetus behind expressing a genderqueer or nonbinary identity through fashion is typically only the desire for self-expression, it may be seen as a political act in the society and culture in which the genderqueer person exists.
The differentiation between gender norms through clothing came into more prominence and importance during the 19th century, mainly through the use of different fabrics, trims and constructions for different genders. These distinctions were meant to mirror gender roles in society as masculine clothing aimed to be practical while female fashion was perceived as purely aesthetic. Despite the entrenchment of links between fashion and gender identity, gender expression today is recognized by the LGBT community as a very personal and subjective behaviour; genderqueer style is therefore intrinsically tied to identity, and as such, includes a vast range of aesthetics. This expression of gender through fashion is seen as a fundamental aspect of both self-realisation and presentation, with changes in clothing often playing a key role in this realisation.
However, the presentation of a nonbinary or genderqueer identity through fashion often presents problems in societies wherein clothing is produced in a heavily gendered way, which often in turn reflect that society's interpretation of gender identity, meaning that the expression of a genderqueer identity is often politicised and restricted. In an article featuring gender non-conforming writer and performance artist Alok Vaid-Menon, Vaid-Menon posited that fashion represented the inherent politics of a person, with genderqueer and transgender people, whose existence is often politicised, being especially aware of this, particularly for people assigned male at birth, for whom the act of presenting femininely, through wearing dresses and makeup, is likely to attract unwanted attention.
There's a material consequence to me presenting feminine, and there's not a material consequence to me presenting masculine, the minute I wear lipstick, or the minute I put on earrings, or the minute I'm wearing a skirt, my entire reality shifts.
The heightened aspect of risk for nonbinary people assigned male at birth presenting their identity through fashion was emphasised in 2017 study from Davidson Skylar, showing that non-binary people assigned male at birth encountered more negative employment outcomes than non-binary people who were assigned female at birth, a phenomenon considered to be an aspect of transmisogyny.
Emerging designers.
Most mainstream stores separate man and women clothing in different sections, making it difficult for genderqueer people to find clothes that fit. Genderqueer designers are trying to build a bridge between menswear and womenswear by meeting the clothing needs of all identities. For example, the clothing brand NO SESSO specializes in using different prints, fabric and reconstructed materials to dress various body types and gender identities.
Sharpe Suiting is a fashion line that through a Kickstarter campaign was able to manufacture custom-constructed dresswear and a ready-to-wear line for a niche of masculine and androgynous people. Its innovative feature consists in developing a system of measuring and tailoring techniques that minimize female curves of people who don't identify as women. This method is called andropometrics and is an androgynous alternative to the standard anthropometrics method used by most manufacturers.
Maternity lines often include stereotypically feminine elements both in shapes and patterns, as motherhood and femininity are commonly considered to be matching. An alternative was offered by the startup company butchbaby &amp; co, the first wear line for pregnant genderqueer individuals.
Global retail brands.
Non-conforming fashion styles are gaining acceptance by a larger audience; for this reason, brands such as Zara and H&amp;M are trying to offer unisex clothing lines to consumers by launching gender neutral collections.
These collections are represented by female or male models only. Also, these unisex products display an aesthetic typically considered masculine, both in shapes and colours (grey, beige and brown).
High fashion modeling.
Genderqueer fashion is being increasingly recognized by high fashion designers who are now showcasing it on their runaways. For example, during Moschino's Fall 2018 menswear and women's Pre-Fall show, Jeremy Scott presented a gender non-conforming look modelled by nonbinary model Oslo Grace and genderqueer drag queen Violet Chachki. In Violet Chachki's words: "It's very important to have visual representation, to show that queers are important, queers are powerful, queers are beautiful, queers are valid, and you can't erase us".
Moreover, modeling agencies are starting to scout non-binary models. This is the case of My Friend Ned; a South African agency that officially divides its models in male, female and non-binary sections.
Overall, genderqueer representation in the high fashion world appears to be growing and to be increasingly acknowledged by the media. Famous examples of genderqueer/non-binary models are Casey Legler, labelled as the world's first "female male model", Elliott Sailors, Rain Dove, Stas Fedyanin and Erika Linder.

It is the only historic house in the United States also used as a rest area. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1984.
Construction.
In 1865, tobacco dealer Edward L. Anderson completed construction of a simple two-story, brick farmhouse, the bricks for which had been fired in a pit on the grounds. The house remained in the Anderson family until sold to a local businessman, Edward Lafayette Atkins, in 1903. Atkins commissioned his friend, architect Alda Lafayette Lassiter to remodel the house in the Classical Revival style. Lassiter added a grand staircase, elaborate plaster ceilings with crown molding, and a large portico with eight Corinthian columns. The house was painted white, and Atkins named it Whitehaven.
In 1908, after the death of Atkins' wife, Atkins sold the house to James P. Smith, mayor of Paducah. The Smiths made many changes, hiring Marshall Fields to do interior decorating. Smith added a storm shelter in the back yard and converted the attic into additional bedrooms for their six children. Nell Smith changed the name of the now-22-room house to "Bide-A-Wee" ("Stay awhile") to honor her Scottish heritage, and she and her daughter created formal gardens on the property.
Decline.
The last member of the Smith family moved out of the house in 1968, and it was left with caretakers who seem to have both abused the house and sold fixtures from it. After the caretakers themselves moved out in 1979, vandals broke every remaining pane of glass but one, and water damage rotted ceilings, floors, and portico. A portion of the east wall collapsed.
Restoration.
In 1981 the Smith family sold the 32-acre parcel to Paducah Junior College, which planned to use the property in expanding the college. The college did not want to demolish the house, but it did not have the money to restore it either. Later that year, Kentucky governor John Y. Brown Jr. and Kentucky Secretary of Transportation Frank Metts decided that the house could serve as the I-24 welcome center. There was opposition from other tourism-dependent counties, which wanted a modern welcome center nearer the interstate highway and the Ohio River and believed that restoring the mansion benefited Paducah and McCracken County at the expense of other, nearby tourist areas. 
After a brief archaeological investigation, the house was carefully restored using as much original material as possible. The kitchen wing was partially demolished and the remainder adapted to serve as a welcome center, with restrooms, information desk, and storage areas. Three outbuildings—the gazebo, storm shelter, and carriage house—were also saved and repurposed. Part of the second floor of the house was devoted to displaying memorabilia of Kentucky politician and US vice president Alben Barkley (1877-1956). The welcome center, renamed "Whitehaven," was officially opened on June 23, 1983.

Erich-Weinert-Ensemble

The Erich-Weinert-Ensemble was a professional army ensemble of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic. The ensemble consisted of a male choir, a ballet, an orchestra, a cabaret, soloists, dramaturges, conductors, directors, choreographers and technical and organizational staff. The ensemble was based in Berlin-Biesdorf. The ensemble was named after Erich Weinert, a German communist writer.
History.
On 15 July 1950, a folk art ensemble was set up by Kasernierte Volkspolizei. It was handed over to the NVA in 1956, where it was renamed the Erich-Weinert-Ensemble.
The ensemble made a name for itself both locally and internationally due to the diversity of its repertoire, the cultivation of the traditions of the German folk song and propagandistic songs. The ensemble toured the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.
In 1989, the ensemble was transferred to the Bundeswehr and was spun off on June 30, 1991 by order of the German Bundestag. The ensemble was financed by the Federal Defense Ministry of Germany until 1994.

Campaign of the Main

The Campaign of the Main (in German: "Mainfeldzug") was a campaign of the Prussian army in the area of the river Main against the allies of Austria in Southern Germany during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.
Preliminary campaign.
While the greater part of the Prussian troops marched to Bohemia, where they defeated the Austrian and Saxon troops on 3 July 1866 at Königgrätz (Sadova), another part of the Prussian troops invaded the Kingdom of Hanover. After the surrender of Hanover on June 29 these troops - including some small units of allies of Prussia - were grouped under the name "Mainarmee" (German for: Army of the Main) and pushed southward towards the river Main against the South-German allies of Austria.
Course.
The allies of Austria had formed the VIIth and VIIIth Federal Corps of the German Confederation. Both corps had advanced northward to support Hanover. When Hanover surprisingly surrendered the VIIth Corps, built by the Bavarians, stood in Thuringia. The VIIIth Corps, built by troops of Hesse, Baden and Wuerttemberg, stood north of Frankfurt. At first the Prussians attacked the VIIth Corps. The Bavarian troops lost combats at Hünfeld and Dermbach on 4 July and withdrew to the river Franconian Saale. But the Prussians followed quickly across the mountains of the Rhön and beat the Bavarians in the battle of Kissingen and Hammelburg on 10 July.
Now the Bavarians retreated to Würzburg while the Prussians turned westward against the VIIIth Corps which protected Frankfurt. The Prussians crossed the Spessart, defeated the Hessians at Laufach/Frohnhofen on 13 July and the Austrian and Hessian troops at Aschaffenburg on 14 July. The Federal troops had to withdraw westward to the left bank of the Main. After the Prussians had conquered Aschaffenburg and crossed the Main the way to Frankfurt and Darmstadt was open. Now the VIIIth Corps abandoned Frankfurt, moved south across the Odenwald and then turned eastward to meet the Bavarians at the river Tauber. The Prussians occupied the now undefended Frankfurt on 16 July and then followed the VIIIth Corps along the left bank of the Main. In the combat of Hundheim (23 July), the battles of Werbach, Tauberbischofsheim (both 24 July) and Gerchsheim (25 July) the VIIIth Corps was defeated by the Prussians. At 25 July the Prussians also clashed with the Bavarians again at Helmstadt and the following day at Rossbrunn. This combats were also won by the Prussians. The allied troops retreated to Würzburg. The Prussians followed and began to bombard the fortress of Würzburg on 26 July. But soon a truce was negotiated after the news had reached the Bavarian headquarters, that the Prussians and the Austrians had signed their Armistice of Nikolsburg at the same day. At last Würzburg was occupied by the Prussians.
In a separate operation the 2nd Prussian reserve corps marched into Bavaria at the north-east on 23 July and occupied Hof, Bayreuth (28 July) and at last Nuremberg (31 July).
Reasons for the Prussian victory.
The Prussian victory is more the result of better organization than of the technical superiority of the Prussian weapons like the needle gun ("Zündnadelgewehr"). Helmut von Moltke, the chief of the Prussian general staff, had planned an offensive war to beat the federal troops before they could unite and fully use their superiority in men and equipment. The plan was successful because the untrained federal armies needed a long time for mobilization which the Prussians had prepared well. Furthermore the Prussians had one unified command which the federal side had not. Formally Karl von Bayern, the commander of the VIIth corps, was supreme commander of all the federal troops, but Alexander von Hessen, the chief of the VIIIth corps, also received orders from the Federal Convention ("Bundestag") in Frankfurt and the governments of the states which had sent troops. The communication between the federal troops was as insufficient as their reconnaissance so that they often had to react instead of acting initiatively.
Consequences.
The German Confederation was abolished. Prussia annexed Hannover, Nassau, Hesse-Kassel and Frankfurt and small parts of Hesse-Darmstadt and Bavaria. Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt remained independent, but had to sign military alliances with Prussia. In Bavaria a fundamental army reform followed in 1868.

Ernest Ferroul

Ernest Joseph Antoine Ferroul (13 December 1853 – 29 December 1921) was a French physician and politician.
He held extreme left political views.
He was twice a deputy for the southern department of Aude between 1888 and 1902, was first elected mayor of Narbonne in 1891 and held that office from 1903 until his death.
He is known as one of the leaders of the successful 1907 revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers, in which up to 800,000 vineyard smallholders and workers demonstrated to demand government action to end unfair competition.
Early years (1853–88).
Ernest Joseph Antoine Ferroul, also known as "Lo Pelut", was born in Mas-Cabardès, Aude, on 13 December 1853.
He became a physician and a socialist.
He was a great defender of viticulture.
He studied medicine at the University of Montpellier and received his doctorate.
He contributed to the socialist newspapers in provincial cities such as Lyon, Marseille and Narbonne.
He was director of "La République sociale" in Narbonne.
He practiced as a physician in Narbonne and became a city councilor.
In 1882 he founded the first socialist group in Narbonne, and then joined the Guesdists of the French Workers' Party (POF: Parti ouvrier français).
First term as deputy (1888–93).
Ferroul ran for the Radical Socialist party in the legislative by-election of 8 April 1888 to replace Pierre Papinaud, who had been appointed governor of Nosy Be, Madagascar.
In the first round he won 24,987 votes against 18,898 for the opportunist candidate M. Coural and 8,498 for General Boulanger.
Coural withdrew, and in the second round Ferroul defeated Boulanger by 29,645 votes to 4,468.
He joined the socialist group in the chamber, and publicly protested against the "Boulangist" label he had been given.
He participated in the Workers Congress in Troyes.
In the chamber he voted for suppression of the Vatican embassy, but this measure was defeated.
He voted against indefinite postponement of revision to the Constitution and against the prosecution of three deputies who were members of the Ligue des Patriotes.
He abstained from voting on the draft Lisbonne law restricting the freedom of the press and on the prosecution of General Boulanger.
Ferroul was reelected in 1889, holding office until 14 October 1893.
In the first round of election for the first constituency of Narbonne on 22 September 1889 he won 3,014 votes to 3,356 to the republican Douarche.
In the second round on 6 October 1889 he won by 4,829 votes to 4,297.
In these elections he was one of three Boulangists affiliated with the POF, the others being Christophe Thivrier of Allier and Antoine Jourde of Gironde.
Friedrich Engels saw the elections as a success, counting Eugène Baudin, Thivrier and Félix Lachize as Marxists, and considering that Gustave Paul Cluseret and Ernest Ferroul were "bound to cast in their lot with the first three."
On 19 November 1889 Baudin, Joseph Ferroul, Antide Boyer and Valentin Couturier proposed that the mines should be nationalized, and demands for nationalization of regulation grew as strikes spread across France.
In the general elections of 1893 he was defeated in the first round of voting by Henri Rouzaud(), republican candidate of the government.
Later career (1893–21).
In 1891 Ferroul was elected mayor of Narbonne on the socialist list.
He was suspended in 1892 but reelected in 1894, holding office until 1897, when he was defeated.
He was reelected in 1900 but the election was cancelled.
In 1902 he was elected with a strong majority and held office as mayor until 1921.
In the May 1898 general elections Ferroul was narrowly defeated in the second round by Edmond Bartissol().
The election was annulled on 5 December 1898, and he was elected in a by-election on 26 February 1899.
He held office as deputy for Aude until 31 May 1902.
He did not run for reelection in the 1902 general elections.
In the general elections on 6 May 1906 he ran again and was decisively defeated in the first round by Émile Aldy().
Ferroul was one of the leaders of the 1907 revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers who were protesting unfair competition.
On 5 May 1907 a rally in Narbonne mobilized between 80,000 and 100,000 people.
As mayor Ferroul took a stand for the struggle of the Midi winemakers.
He told the crowd, "For a long time you have given credit to the state. The time has come where your debt is to be repaid ".
On 12 May 1907 these were 150,000 demonstrators at a rally in Béziers.
Ernest Ferroul advocated a tax strike if the government did not meet the winegrowers' demands by 10 June.
On 26 May from 220,000 to 250,000 people demonstrated in Carcassonne.
Ferroul played on the secular opposition between North and South in calling on the crowd to stand united.
On 9 June 1907 a gigantic gathering in Montpellier marked the climax of the vineyard challenge in the Midi.
In his speech Ferroul called for the resignation of all his colleagues from Languedoc-Roussillon and openly advocated civic disobedience.
The deadline for the ultimatum to the government came on 10 June 1907 and Ferroul announced his resignation as mayor and proclaimed the start of the municipal strike.
On 12 June Ferroul spoke of the premier, "Monsieur Clemenceau, since the beginning of our demonstrations, has considered us as big children, good boys, but unaware of our actions. 
He is one of those who think that in the Midi everything ends with songs or farandoles. 
He is very wrong, he does not know us."
Clemenceau asked Albert Sarraut to bring Ferroul to the negotiating table. 
Ferroul told him: "When we have three million men behind us, we do not negotiate".
On 19 June Ferroul was arrested at dawn at his home in Narbonne by troops of the 139th Infantry Regiment and imprisoned in Montpellier.
Later the government passed the requested laws and the revolt's leaders were released.
On 22 September 1907 the General Confederation of vine growers of the South (CGV) was constituted. 
Its main mission was to fight against fraud and to protect the social and economic interests of producers. 
The first president of the CGV was Ferroul and Elie Bernard became its Secretary General.
Ferroul ran again in the general elections of 24 April 1910 for the second constituency of Narbonne and was narrowly defeated by Albert Sarraut.
He was again defeated by Sarraut in the 26 April 1914 elections.
He did not run in the elections of 1919.
Ferroul died in Narbonne, Aude, on 29 December 1921.

While some characters from the previous novels make appearances in the book, "Tess of the Road" is not a direct sequel to those novels, but is the start of a new duology. It was published by Random House on February 27, 2018. "Tess of the Road" was nominated for the 2018 Andre Norton Award and the 2018 Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book.
Synopsis.
The main character of the story Tess of the Road is Tess Dombegh. Tess is the younger sibling of Seraphina, the main character of the previous books by Rachel Hartman, along with her twin sister, Jeanne. She is (supposedly) the younger twin, and thus her role in life is to help her sister find a good husband and live a proper life. Tess is often the scapegoat of the family, and her mother often blames her for everything that goes wrong. Tess helped her sister arrange to marry Lord Richard Pfanzlig, and her sister invited her to stay with her as a nursemaid. The brother of Lord Richard, Brother Jacomo, hates Tess for reasons unbeknownst to her in the beginning, although it becomes clear that he hates her because he is a follower of St. Vitt, who damns premarital sex, and Tess had a bastard son. Tess's mother is also a follower of St. Vitt, and that is the reason she hates Tess so much. During Jeanne's wedding night, Tess got drunk and punched Brother Jacomo in the nose. She then was sent to live with Seraphina for a few days while they decided what to do with her. It is revealed at this time that Seraphina was pregnant. Seraphina hints that Tess should run away instead of joining the convent of St. Loola, which is what her mother wanted. Tess reluctantly runs away, and runs into her old friend Pathka. Pathka is a quigutl. He was a female quig when Tess first met him, but he changed his sex as he could likely no longer bear eggs. It is revealed that Tess saved his life, because when he was laying his egg, it got stuck, and she pulled it out. She then taught herself the Quigtul language, Quootla, and became friends with Pathka. Tess decides to pose as a man to be afforded more freedom during her journey, and adopts Jacomo's name as a way to gain favor with people. She walks with Pathka, and they try to find a world serpent, which are deities that the Quig worship. They make many stops along the way to Anathusia, one of the world serpents. She faces trials both inner and outer, and makes many friends. In the end, she just keeps walking.
Reception.
"Tess of the Road" has been received positively by critics, and has been awarded four starred reviews. "Booklist" commented "First in a duology, this is a perfect example of a familiar fantasy trope being given new dimension through empathetic characters and exquisite storytelling. At first appearing bitter and self-pitying, Tess reveals compassion, courage, and resilience on her journey, which is as emotional and spiritual as it is physical." "Kirkus Reviews" said "Angry, bitter Tess has reason for her feelings but is not always easy to walk with, and the slow reveal of her past makes for a compelling read on the ways in which girls—in the quasi-Renaissance Goredd and also in the real world—are taught to take blame on themselves even when others are culpable. Fortunately, the Road has answers ("walk on"), and by the end Tess has faced her past and can look forward to another volume of adventure, discovery, and changing her world." "Bulletin"'s review states that "her story is also a rousing adventure set in a richly drawn world, and the novel’s conclusion sets up a sequel that promises to have every bit as much excitement, and a healthy dose of political intrigue as well. Newcomers to Hartman’s work will be every bit as enthralled as her fans with this companion novel to Seraphina (BCCB 9/12) and Shadow Scale." "Shelf Awareness" writes "Fully human Tess's life has been constrained by shame and the medieval expectations of others. Her growing awareness of the inequality and unfairness she has been subjected to, along with an unfolding sense of herself and her potential, will captivate any reader. Tess's ultimately unquenchable spirit and her struggles and adventures are a delight."
"Tess of the Road" won the 2019 Young Adult Sunburst Award for Excellence in Canadian Literature of the Fantastic and the 2018 Cybils Award for Young Adult Speculative Fiction, and was nominated for the 2018 Andre Norton Award and the Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book

Prospect, Corlough

Prospect (Modern English name meaning ‘An extensive view of landscape’ because of the fine view it gives over Brackley Lough from Prospect Point at the southern tip of the townland. The old Irish place name was "Renmore or Rinn Mór" meaning the 'Big Promontory or Headland') is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. 
Geography.
Prospect is bounded on the north by Tawnagh townland, on the south by Moneynure and Tirnawannagh townlands, on the west by Derry More and Scrabby, Corlough townlands and on the east by Brackley, Templeport, Mullaghlea and Derrymony townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, small streams, quarries, sinkholes and dug wells. Prospect is traversed by minor public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 227 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Prospect was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is "Baile Cluain Loch", meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow')
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of "Gortatawill". (Irish name, either Gort an Tuathail meaning 'The Field facing away from the Sun' or Gort an Eochaille meaning "The Field of the Yew Wood".)
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts Prospect as "Renmore".
William Petty's 1685 map of Cavan depicts the townland as "Renmore".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 29 April 1611, King James VI and I granted "the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely, gent". Mulmore O'Reilly had been dispossessed of his lands in the townland of Aghaweely Lower in the parish of Ballintemple. He was the grandson of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Fearghal macSeaán, who ruled East Breifne from 1526–1534. His genealogy is "Maol Mórdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Seaán son of Cathal son of Eóghan na Fésóige". Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- Émonn, Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh) (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. He left his lands in Tawnagh to his son Émonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. Émonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said "Edm’ Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called Carrick in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O’Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises." At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, Émonn and Phillip. Hugh's son Émonn had one son Sémus.
The aforesaid O’Reilly lands in Prospect were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. In 1657 "A list of the Papist Proprietors names in the County of Cavan, as they are returned in the Civill Surveys of the said County" gave the names of 20 landowners whose property was confiscated in the barony of Tullyhaw. These included Hugh O'Rely whose lands were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the townland as "Ranmore" and lists the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford" with the tenants as "William Chambers &amp; others". A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, the lands of "Renmoor". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of "Renmoor" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford". Beresford then leased the land to John Graham. On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the land of "Renmore" to Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, for a term of 99 years. Saunders' son Morley later sold his leasehold interest to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy. Deeds, tenant lists etc. relating to Prospect from 1650 onwards are available at- by searching for 'Derryvella'.
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were seven taxpayers in "Gartetoill- Thomas Magawran of Gartetoill, John Graham of the same, Tirlagh McKelagher of the same, Hugh McBrien of the same, Owen McKelacher of the same, Edmond O Helicke of the same and Hugh McGawran of the same".
The 1690 list of outlawed Irish Jacobites in County Cavan includes "John Graham and Thomas Graham of Gortatole, gents". John Graham was probably the man named in the Hearth Money Rolls above or his son.
The will of Philip Fitzpatrick of "Gratetowel" is dated 30 July 1735.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Rynmore".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Prospect", with a sub-division to the south named "Rinn Wood" (a remnant from the original name of the townland- Renmore).
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list seventeen tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance survey Namebooks state- "The townland is bounded on the south side by a large lake. There is plenty of limestone on the land which is burned &amp; used for manure."
In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, "Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate". 
The Prospect Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seven landholders in the townland.
There is a poem composed by Philip King of Prospect on the death of his sister Máire Nic Conraoi, entitled "Máire Dheas Nic Conraoi" (viewable online at JSTOR).
Census.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are six families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland.

Har Shaakh Pe Ullu Baithaa Hai

Har Shaakh Pe Ullu Baithaa Hai is an Indian sitcom television series, that premiered on 26 February 2018 on StarPlus. The Show stars Rajeev Nigam and Samta Sagar in Lead Roles. The Show is produced by Garima Productions. The Show derives its title from the famous sher by Shauq Bahraichi.
Plot.
“Promise what benefits them and do what benefits us!” has been the mantra of our opportunistic politicians for ages now. Still, whenever some shrewd politician shows up with sweet words and a welcoming smile the junta votes again hoping that the solution has arrived! Shri Chaitu Lal (Rajeev Nigam) is Chief Minister of a fictional state named Ulta Pradesh. This Chief Minister is known for fooling the innocent citizens by making false promises. Like any other neta Chaitu is a fairly manipulative, wise with words and is of an opportunistic kind. His 'thenga party' vouches only for black money by manipulating the system. He promises what benefits the common man but does what benefits him. Supporting him in this comedy show is his wife Imli Devi (Samta Sagar). She stands by her husband through the thick and thin. Even though Chaitu is the leader of the ruling party when it comes to home, his wife is his biggest support system. Imli hopes to see her brother and CM's enthusiastic brother-in-law, Putan (Ishtiyak Khan) as the Prime Minister of the nation. Putan a youth icon of his state is as shrewd as his Jijaji. He has 13 cases lodged against him and has purchased degrees from all the top colleges of the state. Puttan is no less to Chaitu in any way when it comes to politics and corruption.
Reception.
The show is a satirical take on the common man's issues. It shows Chaitu Laal dealing with common man's issues such as education, infrastructure, corruption etc. while also focusing on events like the rigged elections, buying and selling of MLAs and the foundation of random committees that misuse public money. It is through these events that the show unveils the ugly side of politics in a slapstick manner with funny situations.

Coomsaharn char

The Coomsaharn char ("Salvelinus fimbriatus"; the spellings "Coomasaharn" and "charr" are also used; ) is a species of lacustrine char fish in the family Salmonidae.
It is only located in Lough Coomsaharn, County Kerry, Ireland.
Taxonomy.
Name.
The English word "char[r]" is thought to derive from Old Irish "ceara"/"cera" meaning "[blood] red," referring to its pink-red underside. This would also connect with its Welsh name "torgoch", "red belly."
Lough Coomsaharn () derives its name from the Irish "Com Sathairn", "hollow of Saturday(?)".
Biology.
"Salvelinus fimbriatus" spawns in November/December and feeds on zooplankton. It is distinguished from other "Salvelinus" in Ireland by large eyes, having 27–30 gill rakers, with 16–20 on the lower part (hence the species name "fimbriatus", "fringed"). Also, its body depth is 20–25% of snout length, the snout is conical, and the lower jaw is not included in the upper one; an adaptation that helps it to feed on plankton.
History.
The Coomsaharn char are a remnant fish of the Last Ice Age.

1804 Mtiuleti rebellion

The 1804 rebellion in Mtiuleti was a conflict in the former Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (eastern Georgia), at that time part of the Georgia Governorate of the Russian Empire. It was the first major Georgian rebellion directed against the Russian administration. 
Background.
In 1801, the Russians capitalized on the moment, and annexed the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. The entity was then reduced to the status of a Russian region (Georgia Governorate). Though the Russian administration brought some peace, Kartli-Kakheti remained troubled.
Rebellion.
It broke out at a vulnerable spot, to the west of the Darial Pass. A number of local Ossetians had complained about the grain and meat demands of Cossacks stationed in the area. They were thrown into a pit. The Cossacks then proceeded to punish more locals; peasants were put to forced labour, two men were killed by whip lashing, women were mistreated, and cattle was worked to death.
The people of the Aragvi valley then attacked the troops of , killing several of them. They then proceeded to occupy several of the forts on the nearby main road. In the summer of 1804, 4,000 Georgian and Ossetian rebels requested Prince Parnaoz to lead them. On 3 August 1804, the rebels and Russian forces clashed at Lomisi; the Russian forces reportedly only escaped defeat due to the "timidity" of the Kakhetian nobles and the return of Russian General Pavel Tsitsianov, who had just unsuccessfully besieged Erivan. The rebellion was eventually crushed; hundreds of highlanders were bayoneted or imprisoned. It would take eight years before more anti-Russian violence erupted.
A part of the Georgian nobles participated in the 1804 Mtiuleti rebellion. Zaza Jughashvili, Joseph Stalin's great grandfather, also took part in the rebellion.

Dorothy Louise Vennard was born in New York City in 1937. She has one sister. She grew up in Palo Alto, California, where her father worked as a civil engineer. She earned a BA at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
After college, she began working out of Denver as a stewardess for United Airlines. She met Richard Lamm at a party in 1959; they married in 1963. She then began working as a psychiatric social worker. In 1967 Lamm earned her Master of Social Work at the University of Denver. 
Political career.
First Lady of Colorado, 1975–1987.
Lamm was the First Lady of Colorado during her husband's three terms as governor from 1975 to 1987. She used her position as a platform to advance issues such as reproductive rights, equal pay for equal work, and child care. From 1976 to 1977 she chaired the Governor's Task Force on Children and served as a member of the Colorado Commission on Women.
After a women's magazine published excerpts from the journal she had kept during her husband's gubernatorial campaign, she proposed a weekly column for "The Denver Post". Her column, in which she discussed her personal life and aired her political, social, and feminist views, ran from 1979 to 1996.
Political appointee.
President Bill Clinton named Lamm as a member of the official United States delegation to the 1994 United Nations Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo. Clinton also named her as a delegate to the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995.
1998 campaign for United States Senate.
In 1997 Lamm declared her intention to run for United States Senator from Colorado on the Democratic ticket. Her opponent would be Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who had won the Senate seat as a Democrat in 1992 (defeating Richard Lamm for the Democratic party nomination), but who had changed his party affiliation to Republican in 1995. She won the Democratic state primary in August with 57 percent of the vote, to 43 percent garnered by State Representative Gil Romero.
Lamm's campaign called for improvements in the state's fiscal, educational, and environmental policies in order to benefit children. "The Washington Post" wrote:
Lamm held up a thick stack of papers at debates, calling it Campbell's book of missed votes. She blasted Campbell for conflicting votes on issues including abortion, corporate tax breaks and gay rights. [Richard] Lamm, who lost the 1992 Democratic primary to Campbell, hired a gymnast named "Flip-horse" in September to perform back hand springs at campaign stops.
Lamm raised $1.64 million for her campaign, which included revenue from fundraisers that she held with Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Campbell raised $2.9 million and received endorsements from former president George H. W. Bush and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole. In the November election, Campbell garnered 62 percent of the vote, compared to 35 percent for Lamm.
Other activities.
In 1999 Lamm began teaching at the University of Denver as the 1999/2000 Leo Block Fellow, giving courses on population, leadership, and risk-taking. She then became an adjunct professor in the Community Track at the university's graduate school of social work, giving courses on community organization and political advocacy. She retired from teaching in 2006.
In recent years, Lamm has volunteered in a program for Somali immigrant children, and mentors young women considering careers in politics.
Affiliations and memberships.
Lamm is a founder of the Women's Foundation of Colorado, and was the group's first board president. She is also a founder of the Democratic Women's Caucus of Colorado. As of 2014, she was a member of the foundation board of the Rocky Mountain Farmers' Union, and the Capital Campaign Committee for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.
Awards and honors.
She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. The Women's Foundation of Colorado named its annual Dottie Lamm Leadership Award for high school students in her honor. She was the recipient of the 2014 Empathy Award from Volunteers of America.
Personal life.
She married Richard Lamm, then a lawyer and accountant, in Denver in 1963. They have a son and daughter. Both she and her husband enjoy scuba diving, skiing, and mountain climbing. She has climbed 35 of the fourteeners in Colorado. 
In August 1983 Lamm was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. She wrote about her surgery and chemotherapy treatment at length in her newspaper column, encouraging women to go for mammogram screening, and received many letters of support.

Baltimore Clippers (1945–1949)

The Baltimore Clippers were a minor league professional ice hockey team from in Baltimore, Maryland, playing in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League at Carlin's Iceland. The team began play in the 1944–45 season known as the Baltimore Blades, and were renamed the Clippers from 1946 to 1949. The team name paid homage to local history in the Baltimore Clipper, and the Port of Baltimore. The Clippers ceased operations during the 1949–50 season.
History.
The Baltimore Blades were founded in 1944 by the Jacobs brothers, who owned a military uniform supply company. The Blades replaced the void in the EAHL when the United States Coast Guard Cutters hockey team disbanded. Baltimore was affiliated with the Buffalo Bisons in the American Hockey League. Eddie Shore coached the parent team, and was also the Blades' general manager. Former Bison player Leroy Goldsworthy coached the Blades to a second-place finish in the EAHL.
In the 1945–46 season, the team changed names to the Clippers, and the affiliation with Buffalo ended. Baltimore finished the season fourth in the EAHL, and went through three head coaches, including Jim Foley, Herb Mitchell, and player-coach Jack Riley. In the 1946–47 season, Hank Roy was named head coach, but was replaced with the returning Goldsworthy as Baltimore again finished fourth in the EAHL.
Frank Beisler was named the new head coach and manager for the 1947–48 season. Beisler led the team to 31 wins and finished first place in the league, winning the Walker Cup. Right winger Charlie Knox led the league with 54 goals, and 86 points; center Dave Maguire led the league with 53 assists, and defender Jack Nixon led the league with 182 penalty minutes in 37 games.
The EAHL did not operate for the 1948–49 season, but resumed play for the 1949–50 season. Kilby MacDonald was named the head coach and team manager. After twelve games, the Clippers had four wins, and withdrew from league play on December 4, 1949.
Players.
Notable league executive Jack Riley played for the Clippers from 1945 to 1946. Two Blades players, and seven Clippers players also played in the National Hockey League. Notable players include:

Lee Roy Abernathy

Lee Roy Abernathy (1913–1993) was a Southern gospel music musician, songwriter, and performer.
Biography.
Abernathy was born on August 13, 1913, in the Atco community of Cartersville, Bartow County, Georgia.
He married Louise Ammons, and they had three children, Hugh, Linda, and Susan.
Music.
Abernathy's first musical experience came with his father’s group, the Atco Quartet, at the age of five. His parents instilled a love for quartet music and the tradition of gospel singing conventions, where he learned to read shape notes. He was able to sing harmony with the quartet while standing on a Coca-Cola crate. He studied music under James D. Vaughan, J. M. Henson, and Adger M. Pace.
In the 1930s, he founded the Modern Mountaineers, performing live on Atlanta's WSB (AM). In 1936, he wrote "Good Times Are Coming Soon," a reelection campaign song for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He wrote many gospel songs, including "He’s A Personal Savior", "A Newborn Feeling", and "I Thank My Savior for It All", but his signature song was "A Wonderful Time Up There". Some pastors objected to its jazz beat, which influenced the early career of Elvis Presley. Abernathy disregarded the criticism, believing that he had written the song as a result of divine inspiration. The song was later called the "Gospel Boogie" and was recorded by numerous quartets, as well as Johnny Cash, Johnny Mathis, and Pat Boone. Boone's recording of the song reached number four on the Billboard charts in 1958.
Abernathy wrote "Burning of the Winecoff Hotel" following the tragic Winecoff Hotel fire in Atlanta in 1946. He was a frequent guest of the hotel and would have been at the hotel on the night of the fire, but had gone home when a friend gave him a gasoline ration stamp.
Abernathy became the pianist for the Homeland Harmony Quartet in 1947. He also performed with the Rangers Quartet, Jubilee Quartet, Miracle Men, Happy Two, and Abernathy All Star Quartet. Happy Two appeared on WAGA-TV television in Atlanta beginning in 1951 and continued for seven years.
Political life.
Abernathy launched a campaign for Georgia governor in 1958. He finished a distant third in the Democratic party primary behind William Bodenhamer and the eventual winner, Ernest Vandiver.
Death and legacy.
Abernathy continued to teach piano and voice lessons until his death on May 25, 1993. He was buried at Cherokee Memorial Park in Canton, Georgia.
He is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame. In 1989 he received the Mary Tallent Pioneer Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.
The "Annual Memorial Lee Roy Abernathy Singing" is held in Canton in his honor.

Statue of Saint Volodymyr, London

The statue of Saint Volodymyr in Holland Park, London, is a work of 1988 by the Canadian-Ukrainian sculptor Leo Mol. The bronze statue stands on the corner of Holland Park and Holland Park Avenue. It was unveiled on 29 May 1988, to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of the Christianisation of Kievan Rus'. Later that year, another statue of Volodymyr by the same sculptor was erected in Rome.
Vladimir is anachronistically represented "Ruler of Ukraine", according to the inscription on the pedestal.
In fact, the term Ukraine is encountered in the historical sources only since the end of XII century (namely, first time in the Hypatian Codex, 1187). However, The Primary Chronicle of the Hypatian Codex is considered to be unreliable by many Russian scholars.

1928 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1928 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 6, 1928, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
However, with all other prominent Democrats sitting the election out, the party nominated Alfred E. Smith, four-term Governor of New York as its nominee for 1928, with little opposition. Smith had been the favorite for the 1924 nomination, but had lost due to opposition to his Catholic faith and "wet" views on Prohibition: he wished to repeal or modify the Volstead Act.
Once Smith was nominated – despite his attempt to dispel fears by nominating "dry" Southern Democrat Joseph T. Robinson as his running mate – extreme fear ensued in the South, which had no experience of the Southern and Eastern European Catholic immigrants who were Smith's local constituency. Southern fundamentalist Protestants believed that Smith would allow papal and priestly leadership in the United States, which Protestantism was a reaction against.
In Georgia – alongside Texas the only state that had never to that point voted Republican even during Reconstruction – many Protestant ministers were strongly opposed to Smith. However, with the state’s large number of majority-black counties, there was great opposition to Hoover because of the strong Republican association with Reconstruction and black political power.
As of 2021, this is the last election in which a Democratic candidate won Georgia without carrying Fulton County (home to Atlanta).
Vote.
The Smith/Robinson ticket carried the state of Georgia on election day, making the state, with Texas voting Republican for the first time, the only state to have never voted for a Republican presidential candidate. Nonetheless, Hoover did fare better than any other GOP presidential nominee in Georgia history, and his vote percentage would not be beaten until Barry Goldwater carried the state in 1964, by when the national Democratic Party had become firmly linked with black civil rights. As in the rest of the South, Hoover’s gains were largely confined to areas with few blacks, where he gained up to fifty percent in Forsyth and Wilkes Counties, and in other northern upcountry counties he gained over forty percent. Nevertheless, unlike most Black Belt areas where there was no pro-Hoover trend, in some heavily black counties like Long, Effingham and McDuffie where the white voting population was substantially German Lutheran and intensely hostile to Catholicism, Hoover did make large gains, meaning that Georgia was one of only two states where any counties with nonvoting black majorities deserted Smith. Hoover also made large gains from the newly developing urban middle class in Atlanta and Augusta, where his gains on Coolidge were comparable to the most anti-Catholic upcountry areas.

CUMYL-4CN-BINACA (also known as CUMYL-CYBINACA or SGT-78) is an indazole-3-carboxamide based synthetic cannabinoid that has been sold online as a designer drug. It is a potent agonist for cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, with "in vitro" EC50 values of 0.58 nM and 6.12 nM, respectively. In mice, CUMYL-4CN-BINACA produces hypothermic and pro-convulsant effects via the CB1 receptor, and anecdotal reports suggest it has an active dose of around 0.1 mg in humans.
CUMYL-4CN-BINACA is metabolized to produce cyanide, raising concerns about liver toxicity. There is one reported case of hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and kidney failure associated with its use.

<doc id="56704446" url="?curid=56704446" title="Evolution of social anxiety">
Evolution of social anxiety

There are many ways to consider anxiety. For example, anxiety is perceived as an emotion but if dysfunctional or debilitating, it may be considered a disorder (see anxiety disorder). From there, anxiety can be divided down into a plethora of categories such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social anxiety. People with social anxiety tend to be shy, refrain from speaking up, lack self-esteem, and defer attention. If severe, social anxiety can be detrimental. Debilitating fears restrain some from performing everyday activities such as public speaking, test taking, or sexual intercourse (see social anxiety disorder). There are a number of evolutionary theories on how social anxiety may have developed, the most prominent of which is exclusion theory.
Biological adaptation to living in small groups.
There is a suggestion that people have adapted to live with others in small groups. Living in a group is attractive as there are more people to provide labor, protection, and a concentration of potential mates. Since much of evolutionary theory is concerned with reproduction, the benefit of exposure to potential mates within a group cannot be overemphasized. But first, one must gather enough resources to be of a certain status to attract a mate. Working together to gather these resources, is thus, is a major attraction. Any perceived threat to group resources would leave an individual on guard, as would any potential position of status that might bring conflict with others. Finally, living in groups offers health benefits.
Resources.
Resources have served as a symbolic form of one's status, allowing the individual to survive and acquire mates. Searching for resources as a collective group may have given access to a substantial amount of capital. Social anxiety might stem back to when people had to negotiate or defend their resources, thereby initiating some kind of 'alert'. Suppression of these negative reactions ultimately helps the individual avoid conflicts which might lead to lack of resources at their disposal, expulsion from the group, or even death. In effect, anxiety in this way is adaptive because it helps people understand what is socially acceptable and what is not. The threat of exclusion of resources could lead to death.
Mates.
The aspect of a partnership will be covered in depth in the "sex, partnership, and familial relations" section. However, it is important to note how access to resources and compatibility within a group impacts an individual's mate selection. Due to the vulnerability of human mothers and babies after birth, a father had to protect both individuals. While they spent less time with the offspring, they were investing more time mastering the external environment for the safety and security of mother and child. Fathers may be confronting external forces threatening resources or social status. Having resources to nourish mother and child attracts potential mates. Maintaining a harmonious relationship among the community helps to access those original resources. Without mates and other relationships to sustain and support an individual, the person faces potential exclusion and isolation.
Health benefits.
At a basic level, being confined to a particular group of people limits exposure to certain diseases. Studies have suggested that social affiliation has an impact on health and the more integrated and accepted we are, the healthier we are.
Theories on social anxiety.
Buss- Social Anxiety may have developed from fearful temperament and either excessive socialization of a child to the point that they are hyperaware of inappropriate social situations or underdeveloped social skills.
Aron- Genetic inheritance of a high level of sensory-processing sensitivity.
Seligman- prepared by evolutionary history to have anxiety (fear) towards objects and situations which were previously perceived as a threat by our early ancestors.
Trower and Gilbert- social anxiety as a way to maintain cohesion in a society 
Gilbert- Social anxiety triggered by competition (status and resources) 
Leary and Kowalski- fostering social inclusion and reducing the risk of exclusion/rejection 
Exclusion theory.
One of the leading theories regarding social anxiety is exclusion theory. At its simplest, social anxiety might be regarded as a basic human need to 'fit' into a given social group. Someone might be excluded due to their inability to contribute to a group, deviance from group standards, or even unattractiveness. Based on the above section outlining the benefits of living in a group, an individual would want to avoid social isolation at any cost. Anxiety may serve as anticipation to an event that may lead to social exclusion. An example that has been put forth puts the mother-infant relationship into play. When an infant is put down and mother leaves, the infant cries out until the mother comes back. The theory put forth claims the infant ensures social inclusion by the mother's return. Another example offers a new perspective on the classic Oedipus Complex. The Oedipus Complex has traditionally referred to an inherent desire to kill one's father and sleep with their mother. This motivation is disbanded due to fears of castration. Perhaps a more practical interpretation of the Oedipus complex is an interpretation through exclusion theory. Instead, the infant fears being abandoned and excluded from the family. The same conclusion can be applied to children who wish to sleep with their parents at night; they fear social exclusion rather than a desire to be intimate with a parent. "It is doubtful how often parents make explicit verbal threats of castration to their children, but they do often make threats of leaving the child, putting the child away somewhere, giving the child away to the police or other strangers, and so forth."Ultimately anxiety as interpreted by exclusion theory emphasizes people's needs to be accepted by other people. Knowing what is and is not seen as attractive to the self and other individuals allows one to prevent rejection, criticisms, or exclusion from others. Indeed, there is a reason that adultery, mate poaching, and murder are prominent reasons for group exclusion, as they impact the fitness (reproductive and physical) of the group.
Sex, partnership, and familial relations.
As referenced before, living in a group gives an individual access to resources and partners. Humans are physiologically sensitive to social cues and therefore detect changes in interactions which may indicate dissatisfaction or unpleasant reactions. People can enhance how others view them by wearing particular clothes, accomplishing academic achievements, playing a certain sport, etc. All of these variables are attributes of how attractive an individual is perceived.
Function, traits, and signals of anxiety.
Overall, social anxiety may serve as a way for people to anticipate certain actions that might bring social exclusion.
People with social anxiety might display characteristics of self-blaming and self-derogating, have high perceived social standards, poorly defined social goals, a heightened sense of self-focused attention and retreat from social situations to avoid social 'mishaps'. Eye gaze avoidance is another major trait, as it typically signals that the individual is not a threat. Those with social anxiety may retreat in social situations to avoid any social mishaps.

Deportation of the Balkars

The Deportation of the Balkars was the expulsion by the Soviet government of the entire Balkar population of the North Caucasus to Central Asia on March8, 1944, during World War II. The expulsion was ordered by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria after approval by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. All the 37,713 Balkars of the Caucasus were deported from their homeland in one day. The crime was a part of a Soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s. Officially the deportation was a response to the Balkars' supposed collaboration with occupying German forces. Later, in 1989, the Soviet government declared the deportation illegal.
Historical background.
In August 1942 five districts of the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (KBASSR) were occupied by German troops. Nalchik, capital of the KBASSR, was occupied on October24, 1942. When the Soviet military forces withdrew they failed to remove or destroy local factories. Most agricultural resources were also untouched; for example 315,000 sheep, 455,000 cattle and 25,000 horses were left for the advancing Germans. Local authorities attempted to organize several partisan groups, but, as the families of the partisans were not evacuated, these groups fall apart. Only one unit, consisting of 125 people was effective.
In early 1943 the KBASSR was liberated by the Soviet Army. Nalchik was liberated by troops of the 37th army together with local partisans. Despite this, according to Soviet reports in May 1943 there were 44 groups of anti-Soviet rebels, 941 people, on KBASSR territory; these included former Communist Party members.
Causes of deportation.
Stalinism.
It is believed that the reason for the deportation of the Balkars, in a broad sense, was the Stalinist system, which depended on the repression of the Soviet people. More specifically Kabarda and Balkaria had acquired a reputation for political unreliability during the repressions of the 1920-30s. During this period, from a Kabardino-Balkarian population of 359,236, 17,000 were arrested for political reasons, 9,547 of them were tried, and 2,184 shot. Repression continued during the prewar and war years. Many notable people were arrested and sentenced: H. Appaev — Chairman of the Chegemsky district Executive Committee, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR; S. Chumakov — head of the CPSU, A. Mokaev — Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the KBASSR; A. Nastev — Chairman of the Elbrus District Administration, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. All of them were rehabilitated in the 1950s and 1960s.
Accusations of betrayal.
Head of the NKVD Beria saw only "a small contribution" from the Balkar people in the fight against the Nazis, and even a "betrayal" amounting to a "failure to protect Balkar Republic, Elbrus". Z. D. Kumekhov, an ethnic Kabardinian and First Secretary of Communist Party's Local Committee, sent "a report with descriptions of the current situation in Balkar's areas of the KBASSR". It is believed that it was prepared for him by the NKVD. The paper contained detailed descriptions of the activities of gangs in the KBASSR including collaboration with German troops. Supposedly assisting the Soviet Army, many groups attacked local civilians and farmers. The NKVD reported that there were 1,737 people in these gangs. Kumekhov's report ended with the words "Based on the above, we find it necessary to resolve the issue of the possibility of resettlement of the Balkars outside the KBASSR."
In a top-secret telegram to Stalin, Beria described the necessity of deportation is proved as follows:According to P. M. Polyan deportations, including that of the Balkars, were not preventive actions, but "revenge" for real or imagined war crimes against the Soviet Union.
Deportation.
Lavrentiy Beria arrived in Nalchik on 2 March 1944. In the early morning of March 8, 1944, two days earlier than planned, Balkar's population was ordered to get ready to leave their homes. The entire operation lasted about two hours. The entire Balkar population was evicted without exception. 17,000 NKVD troops and 4,000 local agents participated in this operation.
By 9 March, 37,713 Balkars were deported in 14 train convoys. They arrived at their destinations in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic by 23 March. After the end of World War II, Karachai and Balkar officers of the Red Army were discharged and later also deported. Official Soviet documents reveal that 562 people died during the deportation. 
Many more died during the harsh years in exile and in labor camps. In total, it is estimated that 7,600 Balkars died as a consequence of the deportation, amounting to 19.82 percent of their entire ethnic group.
Remembrance and legacy.
Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, delivered a secret speech at the Party Congress on February 24, 1956, condemning these Stalinist deportations. Like the other rehabilitated people, the Balkars were then allowed to return from exile to their homeland. They found their homes and farms pillaged and in ruins. While 64 million roubles were allocated to assist the Balkars in rebuilding their housing, they were never given full financial compensation for their lost property or suffering in exile.
The 1959 Soviet census counted 42,408 Balkars. This is a population 10,000 below what was expected before the deportation. Some Balkars maintain that their status of autonomy is still not resolved.

Robert Bartholomew

Robert Emerson Bartholomew (born August 17, 1958) is an American medical sociologist, journalist and author living in New Zealand. He is an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. In addition to publishing more than 60 academic papers, he has written or co-written 16 popular science and skeptical non-fiction books. He writes for several newspapers and journals on sociological and fringe science topics, including "Psychology Today", "Skeptical Inquirer", and British magazines "The Skeptic" and "Fortean Times".
He is an expert in fields such as mass hysteria and mass psychogenic illness and is frequently consulted by media during current events of sociological phenomena such as incidences of suspected mass hysteria or panic.
Academic work.
Bartholomew first obtained a radio broadcasting certificate studying at SUNY Adirondack in 1977 followed in 1979 by a bachelor's degree in communications at Plattsburgh. By 1984 he had been awarded a master's degree in American sociology at State University of New York. In 1992 he gained a masters in Australian sociology from Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia followed by a doctorate in sociology from James Cook University in Queensland, Australia. Finally, in 2001 he gained his teaching qualification from Upper Valley Teachers Institute in social studies.
Bartholomew has also lived and worked in Malaysia and in 2009 worked in sociology at International University College of Technology. In April 2010 he took up a teaching position at Botany Downs Secondary College in Auckland, New Zealand. He is currently an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.
In 2012, Bartholomew published "Australia's forgotten children: The corrupt state of education in the Northern Territory: A case study of educational apartheid at an aboriginal pretend school" in which he uncovered human rights abuses of indigenous Australian aboriginal children who were being exposed to harmful asbestos in the Northern Territory with the knowledge of the Northern Territory Department of Education.
Bartholomew's principal area of academic contribution is in the field of mass psychogenic illness, previously known as mass hysteria, both historical and present day cases, an area he has been studying for over 25 years. He has written extensively about 600 notable instances including the Salem witch trials, the 2011 Le Roy illness, which Bartholomew has described as "the first case of this magnitude to occur in the U.S. during the social networking era", and present-day manifestations, most of which he has said have yet to be studied in-depth by sociologists. 
In 2016, Bartholomew investigated the 2012 case of an outbreak of hiccups in Danvers, Massachusetts (originally Old Salem village), in which 24 young people were stricken with apparently uncontrollable hiccups. After requesting and reviewing state documents from the original investigation, he concluded the most likely explanation was a psychogenic conversion disorder affecting the (predominantly) girls involved. He publicly stated the Massachusetts Department of Public Health had "knowingly issued an inaccurate, incomplete report...They have an obligation to issue accurate diagnoses, and patients have a right to know what made them sick" and filed official complaints of malpractice.
Bartholomew has also drawn attention to the role of the internet in acting as an "echo chamber" for spreading moral outrage; for example on social media, pedophile allegations used as political weapons by supporters of the far right against liberal celebrities, which mirrors earlier public outrage which took the form of the Red Scare (particularly McCarthyism) and the Lavender scare against homosexuals in US government positions.
Bartholomew is frequently interviewed as an expert on topics as diverse as the "Pokémon Panic" of 1997, the spread of UFO conspiracy theories, the 2016 clown panic (which he suggested was a moral panic fueled by social media in response to a fear of strangers and terrorism), the viral spread of online fads such as "Pokémon Go", and the suspected sonic attacks on embassies in Cuba and China which began in 2017, about which he said:
In 2020 he co-authored "Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria", a book on the sonic attack controversy in Cuba with Professor Robert W. Baloh, a neurologist at the UCLA Medical Center. The authors document dozens of similar examples of disorders that have essentially the same features as "Havana Syndrome", but were given different labels, from the 18th century belief that sounds from certain musical instruments were harmful to human health, to contemporary panics involving people living near wind turbines.
In March 2020, Bartholomew was invited to attend a medical conference in Havana, Cuba, on the "attacks", where he repeated the claim that stress-induced mass psychogenic illness was the most likely cause.
Publications.
Academic papers.
Bartholomew has written over 60 academic papers including:
In addition Bartholomew contributes to several newspapers and journals on various sociological and fringe science topics, including "Psychology Today", "Skeptical Inquirer", and British magazines "The Skeptic" and "Fortean Times".
Books.
He is also the author of several popular science and skeptical non-fiction books including:
Reception.
William Gibson in "Mother Jones" described "Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior" as "Essential reading for the era of Trump" while Véronique Campion-Vincent described it as "exceptional in its scope...an indispensable working tool for researchers". Michael Bywater in "The Daily Telegraph" described "Panic Attacks" as "a revealing historical corrective to the tempting view that media manipulation is a late-20th-century invention."
On 19 June 2020, Bartholomew told Te Ao Maori News that a publisher had said his book "No Māori Allowed: New Zealand’s Forgotten History of Racial Segregation" was too pro-Maori. Bartholomew maintained that the stories of segregation needed to be told and New Zealand must '"acknowledge its racist past."
Recognition.
In 2017, Bartholomew was elected a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

CLOUD Act

The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act or CLOUD Act () is a United States federal law enacted in 2018 by the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, PL 115-141, Division V. The CLOUD Act primarily amends the Stored Communications Act (SCA) of 1986 to allow federal law enforcement to compel U.S.-based technology companies via warrant or subpoena to provide requested data stored on servers regardless of whether the data are stored in the U.S. or on foreign soil.
Background.
The CLOUD Act was introduced following difficulties that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had with obtaining remote data through service providers through SCA warrants, as the SCA was written before cloud computing was a viable technology. The situation was highlighted from a 2013 drug trafficking investigation, during which the FBI issued an SCA warrant for emails that a U.S. citizen had stored on one of Microsoft's remote servers in Ireland, which Microsoft refused to provide. The legal challenge led to the Supreme Court in "Microsoft Corp. v. United States". The FBI contended that Microsoft had full control of the data and should be compelled to turn it over in response to the warrant, but Microsoft argued that the SCA did not cover data stored outside the United States. The challenge recognized that while the FBI could request a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) to aid in data discovery during cross-border law enforcement, the process to acquire a new MLAT if one is not in place, or to process a request through an existing MLAT, can be slow and impede law enforcement efforts.
Congress, primarily led by Senator Orrin Hatch, had attempted to create legislation prior to the CLOUD Act to amend the SCA with the concerns of Microsoft and other technology companies with respect to foreign privacy rights. The Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act (LEADS Act) in 2015 and the International Communications Privacy Act (ICPA) in 2017 were both previous bills intended to amend the SCA but which failed to gain passage.
The CLOUD Act is a culmination of these prior bills. Principally, it asserts that U.S. data and communication companies must provide stored data for a customer or subscriber on any server they own and operate when requested by warrant, but provides mechanisms for the companies or the courts to reject or challenge these if they believe the request violates the privacy rights of the foreign country the data is stored in. It also provides an alternative and expedited route to MLATs through "executive agreements"; the executive branch is given the ability to enter into bi-lateral agreements with foreign countries to provide requested data related to its citizens in a streamlined manner, as long as the Attorney General, with concurrence of the Secretary of State, agree that the foreign country has sufficient protections in place to restrict access to data related to United States citizens.
The first such agreement was with the United Kingdom.
There is a FAQ appended to the white paper published by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Support.
The CLOUD Act had support of the Department of Justice and of major technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google. The bill was criticized by several civil rights groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. These groups argued that the bill stripped away Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, since the government could enter into data rights sharing agreements with foreign countries and bypass U.S. courts, and affected users would not have to be notified when such warrants were issued. Some of these groups feared the government would not fully review requests from foreign countries for their citizens' stored on servers in the U.S., potentially allowing such data to be used in bad faith in those countries.
Passing.
After being introduced in the 115th United States Congress as H.R.4943, the act was included as a section of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (), an omnibus spending bill, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law, P.L. 115-141, on March 23, 2018. 
On April 17, 2018, the Supreme Court, based on concurring briefs submitted by the Department of Justice, vacated the "United States v. Microsoft Corp." and remanded it back to lower court to do the same, as the Department of Justice was able to secure a new warrant under the CLOUD Act and was no longer pursuing the initial warrant, rendering the case moot.
International reactions.
The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) viewed the CLOUD Act as a law in possible conflict with the GDPR. The German Commissioner for Data Protection has warned against the use of US based Amazon Web Services for storing sensitive data for the Federal Police.
The law has been viewed as a parallel to China's National Intelligence Law. European journal Le Grand Continent for Emmanuelle Mignon writes: "Adopted without any real debate in 2018, the CLOUD Act continues to attract criticism in the United States and Europe from associations for the protection of fundamental rights and from those who are critical of the extraterritoriality, not always well understood, of American laws."
Franck Decloquement, an expert in economic and strategic intelligence, in the video of his speech at the conference “American extraterritorial sanctions and state independence” at the French National Assembly, summarises the stakes of this law and its exploitation as part of a broader strategy of the United States’ conquest of the digital space.

Anne Montagu, Viscountess Mandeville

Anne Montagu, Viscountess Mandeville (1604 – 14 February 1642), was born Lady Anne Rich, the daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, an English colonial administrator who opposed the policies of Charles I prior to the English Civil War. In 1625 she married, becoming the second wife of Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, a senior commander of Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War. She had three children by Montagu; her son Robert would later become the 3rd Earl of Manchester. Anne Montagu died a year or two before her fortieth birthday, shortly before the Civil War began.
Early life.
Anne was the daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick and his first wife, Frances Hatton (1590–1623). The Earl of Warwick was an English colonial administrator, admiral, and Puritan.
Marriage and family.
On 1 July 1625, aged around 21, Anne Rich married Edward Montagu, then Lord Kimbolton. This was Montagu's second marriage; he had previously been married to Susanna Hill, who died after less than two years without having any children. In 1626, when his father was created an earl, Montagu became known as Viscount Mandeville. Through his wife's father, the Earl of Warwick, Montagu began to have Puritan sympathies and to oppose the policies of King Charles I of England. During the Civil War, Montagu became an important commander of Parliamentary forces.
Viscount and Viscountess Mandeville had three children:
Death and legacy.
Anne died in 1642, shortly before war broke out between the King and Parliament., and just before her husband inherited the Earldom of Manchester in November 1642. Montagu married a further three times, his third wife being Essex Cheeke, who was Anne's second cousin; he had children by only one of his last three wives.
Anne's portrait was painted by Daniel Mytens, a Dutch artist born in Delft and trained in The Hague, who spend most of his career in England, where he became the lover of Charles I. The portrait is now held by the British Embassy at The Hague, part of the Government Art Collection.

2018 Antiguan general election

General elections were held in Antigua and Barbuda on 21 March 2018 to elect members to House of Representatives of the 16th Antigua and Barbuda Parliament. Each of the 17 constituencies elected one Member of Parliament (MP). 
The governing Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party led by Gaston Browne was returned to power, winning 15 of the 17 seats, increasing their majority by one seat. The United Progressive Party, the official opposition, led by Harold Lovell, was reduced to a single seat and Lovell failed to be elected.
Electoral system.
The 17 elected members of the House of Representatives were elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting; 16 of the seats were allocated for the island of Antigua and one for the island of Barbuda. Barbudan electors were required to travel to Antigua to vote as a result of the aftermath of hurricane Irma.
Campaign.
A total of 53 candidates contested the elections, representing seven parties. The Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party nominated a full slate of 17 candidates. The United Progressive Party nominated candidates only on the island of Antugua due to an electoral pact with the Barbuda People's Movement which stood only on the island of Barbuda. Together they fielded a candidate in every seat. The Democratic National Alliance (13) were the only other party to contest more than half the seats. The Antigua Barbuda True Labour Party and Go Green for Life both had two candidates, while the Barbuda People's Movement (affiliated to the United Progressive Party) and Missing Link VOP had a single candidate. A single independent candidate, Attorney-at-law Ralph Francis, contested the seat of Barbuda.
Prime Minister Gaston Browne dissolved parliament fifteen months early. The main issues were the re-building and response to the 2017 Hurricane season, the Barbudan communal land ownership law, tourism resorts notably the Sandals Resorts, and a bribery scandal involving Browne.

Mama Dragons

Mama Dragons is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization that supports, educates, and empowers mothers of LGBTQ children. Since 2014, it has grown from just a handful of moms, to an organization that now supports over 7,000 mothers. Mama Dragons focus is on providing safe online spaces and educational programs where mothers can learn and connect with other Mama Dragons traveling similar paths as they learn safe, accepting parenting practices that can help prevent LGBTQ youth suicide, depression, and homelessness. 
History
The group was founded in January, 2014 by Gina Crivello as she sought the advice of some of the mother’s she had come to know for a member of the GSA she had recently started at American Fork High School in Utah. This message thread almost immediately began to grow as more mothers were added that were navigating supporting their children and the intersectionality of their non-affirming LDS religion. In 2014 Gina suggested to move the Facebook message thread to a Facebook group as conversations were becoming difficult to track. 
Members of this group chose the name "Mama Dragons” because the phrase “Mama Bear” didn’t seem strong enough to protect their children after they came out to them as LGBTQIA+. The name “Mama Dragons” came from a 2012 blog post Meg Abhau wrote shortly after her 13 year-old son came out as gay. 
In 2015 Jen Blair created Mama Dragons closed Facebook group (Mama Dragons Main Group, Private) and began running day to day activities. On November 2015 the LDS church issued the "Nov 5 Exclusion Policy", excluding married gays greatly expanding need of mom support. In 2016 Wendy Montgomery, announced rise in LGBT suicides after the LDS church launches a LGBTQ exclusion policy on November, 5th, 2015 receiving media attention from NPR and other new outlets. The group has also garnered media attention for its advocacy and efforts to prevent LGBT Mormon suicides, as well as for bringing a spotlight to the intersection of religion, family, sexual orientation, and gender expression. 
Led by Mama Dragons President, Julie Packer and a Board of Directors, Mama Dragons became a nonprofit 501(c)3 in 2016, shortening their mission statement to, “We support, educate, and empower mothers of LGBTQ children” redirecting their focus to providing an educational and loving space for mothers, so they can celebrate their child and support their family's unique journey and seasoned mother mentors can lend support, mentorship, and give encouraging advice. Mama Dragons opened their support group to those outside of LDS faith in 2017 and in 2019 they shifted their focus to all moms of LGBTQ children while maintaining specialized support of mothers from non-affirming religions and cultures. In 2018 Mama Dragons invested in training Mama Dragons QPR instructors, a certification program for instructors to teach how to recognize suicidal behaviors and save lives by providing innovative, practical and proven suicide prevention training. In September of 2020 Mama Dragons hired their first Executive Director, Celeste Carolin, a queer business woman that had previously been on the Mama Dragons Board of Directors and leadership team, replacing volunteer President roles. 
Dr. Jennifer Howell, Mama Dragons Parachute Education Director, launched a research based eLearning program called Parachute in July of 2021. This program is designed for parents, families, and communities and provides the knowledge, tools, and resources needed to affirm, support, and celebrate LGBTQ children. The first course launched is "Intro to Understanding Your LGBTQ child" and is open for all those supporting LGBTQ youth and adults. 
Mama Dragons has grown rapidly and as of 2021 Mama Dragons is composed of roughly 25% mothers from the LDS faith, 25% Christian faiths, 27% that are not religious, and the rest from many other religious denominations including Pagan, Jewish, and Buddhist. 
Awards
Mama Dragons was awarded Equality Utah's, Ally of the Year in October, 2016.

Lydia Avilova

Lydia Alexeyevna Avilova (, née Страхова (Strakhova), 15 June 1864 – 27 September 1943) was a Russian writer and memoirist, best known for her book "A.P. Chekhov in My Life", published posthumously in 1947. 
Biography.
Lydia Alekseyevna Strakhova was born in the Klekotki estate, Tula Governorate, Russian Empire, into the family of a local gentry. After graduating from a gymnasium in 1882, she worked for a while as a school mistress, then in 1887 got married and moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg and started writing. A frequent guest at the house of the editor and publisher Sergey Khudekov (her 's husband), she was introduced to many well-known authors of the time. In 1889 she met Anton Chekhov and became his regular correspondent, receiving regular advice on the literary technique and style, as well as occasional help with making her stories published. 
In 1890, assisted by Alexander Sheller-Mikhaylov, Avilova debuted as a published author with a short story called "Two Beauties" (Две красоты). Since then her work started to appear regularly in the periodicals like "Sever" (North), "Detskoye Chteniye" (Children's Reading), "Niva", "Russkiye Vedomosti", "Syn Otechestva", "Novoye Slovo". In 1896 Avilova's first story collection "Lucky Man and Other Stories" (Счастливец и другие рассказы) came out, to be followed two years later by her debut novel "Inheritors" (Наследники). Her second novel "Deceit" (Обман) was published by "Vestnik Evropy" in July 1901.
In 1906 Avilova returned with her family to Moscow and in the course of the next ten years published several books, including "The Power and Other Stories" (Власть и другие рассказы, 1906) and "First Grief and Other Stories" (Первое горе и другие рассказы, (1913), most of them dealing with childhood and child psychology, and much indebted to Chekhov's legacy. In 1914 Avilova became a member of the Russian Literary Society and in 1918 joined the Union of Writers. In 1922 she visited her ailing daughter in Czechoslovakia and became close to the local circle of Russian emigres, but decided to return to the Soviet Union in 1924. "Where there is no Russia, there is no myself," she wrote. In 1929 she was elected an honorary member of The Soviet Chekhov society.
Lydia Avilova died in Moscow on 27 September 1943. She was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery, but the location of her grave has been lost since. The interest in Avilova's literary legacy enjoyed a revival in the 1980s when several of her books were re-issued in the USSR. 
Avilova as memoirist.
Avilova's final work, a book of memoirs called "A.P. Chekhov in My Life" (А.П. Чехов в моей жизни, originally "The Love Affair of My Life", Роман моей жизни), completed in 1939 and published posthumously, in 1947, caused much controversy. It was based upon the premise that the two "had had a secret love affair which lasted a decade and nobody was aware of." Avilova claimed that Chekhov's "About Love" (1898) was a thinly veiled comment on their secret relationships and that the two discussed this fact in their correspondence, one of his letters (which was among the ones she had destroyed) having been even signed "Alyuokhin", which was the name of this story's protagonist.
Maria Chekhova reacted with skepticism to this revelation. "These memoirs are lively and exciting, and many of the things she states in them are undoubtedly true... Lydia Alexeyevna seems to be totally sincere when describing her own feelings to Anton Pavlovich... When it comes to his own feeling towards her, things start to look a bit too 'subjective'," she wrote in her book "From Distant Past". Ivan Bunin, on the other hand, never doubted the memoirist's sincerity. He wrote: "Avilova's memoirs, brilliant, highly emotional, written masterfully and with great tact, became a revelation to me. I knew well Lydia Alexeyevna, a gifted woman with a rare sense of humour, who was also a very honest and shy person... Never did I suspect though, that they had this sort of relationship."
In one of her retrospective reviews, making a collective portrait of Chekhov, Tolstoy and Gorky, Avilova wrote: "... As for Chekhov, I would not call him either a great man or a great writer ... He was a likeable, talented author, an intelligent man and an intriguing character. Gorky: a brilliant writer and highly original man. Tolstoy: a great writer, a great thinker and a great man. Think of a talent breaking through the personality, struggling to lift it up to its own level, and that is Chekhov. Think of a talent and personality which are equally strong and bright; they express themselves in different ways, but, intertwining, merge into one. That is Gorky. But when both the literary gift and the personality are not just great and powerful, but also perfect, soaring well above mankind and near to God's level, then that is Tolstoy."

Big Five of Bayview

The Big Five of Bayview were the community leaders and political activists from the Bayview and Hunters Point districts in San Francisco who were instrumental in backing the India Basin and Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects to completion in the 1960s and 70s. 
Activism.
The five African-American women were all outspoken mothers and members of the Crispus Attucks Club who worked to improve their neighborhood. Arthur Hippler characterized the day-to-day social organization of Hunters Point as "matrifocal".
The Big Five first became active in the early 1960s, confronting poverty and discrimination in Hunters Point, filling the void left by weak religious leaders. Pat Womack identified them as "strong Black women who took a stand" They won fame by marching in 1973 in Washington DC for funds that had been promised to complete the housing to replace temporary housing in Hunters Point, not leaving until they had secured a $30 million grant. Streets and landmarks in the neighborhood have since been named in their honor.
Biographical sketches and legacy.
The Big Five are identified in a 1996 oral history as Julia Commer, Bertha Freeman, Osceola Washington, Elouise Westbrook, and Rosalie Williams. One source from 2007 identifies Ruth Williams as one of the Big Five instead of Bertha Freeman. A second source from 2011 states the Big Five includes Beatrice Dunbar instead of Rosalie Williams and identifies Julia Commer as "Julia Coleman". A third source from 1972 states Ardith Nichols was one of the Big Five instead of Rosalie Williams. The three undisputed members are Julia Commer, Osceola Washington, and Elouise Westbrook.
Julia Commer.
Commer was credited as "one of the community leaders who had fought to turn the 134-acre slum ... into a new environment of garden homes and sparkling schools" in a 1978 "San Francisco Chronicle" article describing the demolition of the temporary housing built to house World War II shipyard workers at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard.
Elouise Westbrook.
Elouise (sometimes written as Eloise) Westbrook was born in Gatesville, Texas in 1915 and moved to San Francisco in 1949. She died in her home on September 13, 2011. At her funeral on September 21, 2011, she was eulogized by Mayor Ed Lee and former mayor Willie Brown, who said "she used to scare me" by demanding he answer her calls and showing up at his office unannounced.
Alternate membership.
As noted above, the following five names have been advanced as part of the Big Five on some lists.
Bertha Freeman.
Bertha Freeman was featured on the news for leading a community sub-committee that selected teaching assistants for the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood.
Ruth Williams.
The theatre at the Bayview Opera House was renamed the Ruth Williams Memorial Theatre in 2016.
Successors and other areas.
One writer identified Espanola Jackson as the successor matriarch in Bayview/Hunters Point. Mary Rogers was cited as having filled a similar role for the Fillmore/Western Addition district.

Andrássy Castle

Andrássy Castle is located in the north-eastern part of Hungary, in Tiszadob, Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County. It was designed by Artúr Meinig for Count Gyula Andrássy, who was the second Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary and first Hungarian prime minister. The legend says that the count built the castle in honour of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (also called Sissi) but it is not proven that she ever stayed in Tiszadob.
History.
The castle and the surrounding park was built between 1880 and 1885. The architect, Artúr Meining built the castle, showing the characteristics of neo-Gothic and Romantic style. The building has 4 entrances in accordance with the 4 seasons, 12 towers for the 12 months, 52 rooms for the 52 weeks of the year and 365 windows for the 365 days of the year. Meinig got his inspiration from European castles, one of the most obvious example for that is the ceiling of L shaped large salon on the ground floor, which is the exact copy of the ceiling stucco of the Cartoon Gallery room of Knole Castle in Kent, England.
Count Andrássy Gyula died in 1890. The castle was then passed to his eldest son, Count Tivadar Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka (10 July 1857 – 13 May 1905).
The castle was raided by savages from the nearby town, Polgár in 1918 during the Aster Revolution. They destroyed not only the furniture but all the paintings, Venetian mirrors, ceramics, books. 
The Andrássy era ended in 1945. First it was an army hospital for the Romanian army. Many soldiers still rest in the park of the castle. Later, in 1948 the state confiscated the castle and from 1950 it became an orphanage and worked as one until 2007.
Renovation.
A large renovation was carried out to the order of Szabolcs- Szatmár- Bereg county's local government between 2011-2014. The renovation was funded by both the Hungarian government and the European Union, and cost approx. EUR 7,1 million. The aim of the refurbishment was to enable Tiszadob and the Andrássy Castle to host a range of cultural attractions. It reopened its gate to visitors in 2015 and since it offers a variety of programs for the locals and tourists.
Piano Feast in the East.
Adrienne Hauser founded a piano festival called Piano Feast in the East in 1998. Since then the most prestigious Hungarian and international musicians gather and perform every August. The concerts are broadcast on the radio.

Chả rươi

Chả rươi ("sand worm omelette") is a Vietnamese dish made from the polychaete worm "Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus", it is most popular in Hanoi. The dish is prepared from live sand worms, which are put in hot water to remove their tentacles, and then mixed with raw egg. Onions and various spices are added, and the mixture is then fried until it obtains a crispy brown surface.
Because the sand worms can only be found in autumn, the dish is not available year round, and is considered a specialty during the autumn. Some vendors use frozen sand worms to be able to serve the dish year-round, but the taste of the fresh sand worms is considered superior. The sand worms are caught from mangroves in Hai Phong.

1924 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1924 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
Vote.
The Davis/Bryan ticket carried the state of Georgia on election day.

The Mao Gong ding is a bronze ding tripod vessel from the Western Zhou dynasty, currently at the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The vessel has an inscription of 500 characters arranged in 32 lines, the longest inscription among the ancient Chinese bronze inscriptions. The ding dates from the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, and was presented to him by the Duke Yin of Mao.
Description.
The Mao Gong ding takes its name from the Duke (公 "gōng") Yin of Mao, who gifted the ding to the King after being appointed to help run state affairs. The artifact is 53.8 cm high, 47.9 cm wide, and weighs a total of 34.7 kilograms.
The interior surface of the ding is covered in an inscription of 500 characters, the longest such inscription known today. The National Palace Museum summarizes its contents:
History.
The Mao Gong ding was excavated in Qishan County, Shaanxi province in 1843, during the Daoguang Emperor's reign. The famous collector Chen Jieqi (1813-1884) acquired it in 1852. He and his studio made precise rubbings of the inscriptions. In Emperor Xuantong era (1909-1911) Duanfang (1861-1911) bought it from the Chen family.
Ye Gongchuo (1881-1968) was presented with the ding by friends bought and presented the tripod to him from the Tianjin Dao Sheng Bank, which had it as a mortgage. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Ye family sold it to Chen Yon Ren, a millionaire in Shanghai. In April 1946, Chen Yon Ren donated the tripod to the Kuomintang Shanghai Government through a general in their army. In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang moved it to Taiwan, where it remains housed at the National Palace Museum.

Times Crescent

The Times Crescent is a newspaper that began publishing on May 26, 1893 and runs to the present day in La Plata, Charles County, Maryland. Walter J. Mitchell, who later became a judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals from 1934-1941, was the man responsible for merging the existing La Plata paper, the "Crescent", with the Port Tobacco Times to form the "Times Crescent" in 1898. When Mitchell became a judge, his son James C. Mitchell took over operations for the "Times Crescent" and remained owner of the paper until his death in 1989. The newspaper went by the name "Crescent" from its inception until January 14, 1898, when it was renamed to "The Times Crescent". The paper ran under this name until March 24, 1966, when it was briefly changed to "The Times-Crescent The Charles County Leaf". On May 27, 1971, the paper returned to its previous name, but with a dash between the words: "Times-Crescent". Finally, in 1989, the "Times" underwent its final name change and became "The Charles County Times-Crescent", which is its name to this day.
Louis Metcalf Hyde was the printer-editor of the "Times Crescent" from 1898 through 1948. He had previously worked for the Port Tobacco Times and became managing editor for the "Times Crescent" after it merged with and absorbed the "Port Tobacco Times".

Jinyunpelta

Jinyunpelta ("Jinyun shield") is a genus of herbivorous ankylosaurine thyreophoran dinosaur from the Cretaceous Liangtoutang Formation of Jinyun County, Zhejiang, China; it has one species, the type species J. sinensis. This species is the basalmost ankylosaur known to have had a proper tail club.
Discovery and naming.
In June 2008, farmer Li Meiyun on a construction site at Huzhen in Jinyun County discovered the remains of an ankylosaur. Between 2008 and 2014 excavations took place by a joint team of the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History, the Jinyun Museum and the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum. In 2013, five ankylosaurian skeletons were uncovered. A new species was to be based on two of these, while preparation of the other finds continued.
In 2018, the type species "Jinyunpelta sinensis" was named and described by Zheng Wenjie, Jin Xingsheng, Yoichi Azuma, Wang Qiongying, Kazunori Miyata and Xu Xing. The generic name combines Jinyun with a Greek "peltè", "small shield", a usual suffix in the names of ankylosaurians. The specific name refers to the provenance from China.
The holotype, ZMNH M8960, was found in a layer of the Liangtoutang Formation dating from the Albian-Cenomanian, about one hundred million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton, with a complete skull, but lacking most of the hindlimbs, apart from the right humerus and the left thighbone. The paratype is ZMNH M8963, a skeleton lacking the skull but including the left lower leg and a complete tail club. It was found at two to three metres distance from the holotype.
Description.
The describing authors indicated a number of distinguishing traits. Some of these were autapomorphies, unique derived characters. Behind the nostril two additional openings are present, in ankylosaurids named the "C1" and the "C2", which in the case of "Jinyunpelta" are on a level with the centre of the nostril. On the front upper edge of the maxilla a triangular depression is present. The postorbital bone does not contribute to the rear edge of the eye socket. In the lower jaw, the front part of the prearticular bone is positioned beneath the rear part of the splenial bone. Obliquely above and to the inside of the inner condyle of the thighbone a distinct tendon scar is present.
Additionally, "Jinyunpelta" shows a unique combination of traits that in themselves are not unique. The combined upper side of the nasal bones is pierced by two paired oval openings. The antorbital fossa, with ankylosaurs the remnant of the antorbital fenestra, extends over the contact point of the maxilla, lacrimal bone and jugal bone. The prefrontal bone extends to below, touching the maxilla. At least some dorsal vertebrae have an elongated centrum, 30% longer than wide. The tail club is hexagonal in top view, with the widest point located near the rear edge.
Phylogeny.
In 2018, "Jinyunpelta" was, within the Ankylosauridae, placed in the Ankylosaurinae. This would imply that it was the oldest known ankylosaurine. A cladistic analysis showed that it was also the basalmost known ankylosaurine, placed below "Crichtonpelta" in the evolutionary tree. It would then furthermore be the oldest and basalmost ankylosaurid that is with certainty known to possess a tail club; previously this had been "Pinacosaurus" dating from the Campanian. The size of the tail club shows that this trait must have been developed early-on in the evolution of ankylosaurids. Additionally, "Jinyunpelta" was the most southern known ankylosaurid from Asia.

Andrea Hannos

Andrea Hannos (born May 8, 1973) is a former Canadian professional road and track racing cyclist who first entered sport in track and field, specializing in the long and triple jump. She attended high school at Little Flower Academy in Vancouver, BC, and graduated in 1991 after winning the triple jump event at the BC high school track and field provincial championships. She then went on to compete in track and field for the Kajaks Track &amp; Field Club and the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds while earning a Bachelor of Science in Cell Biology. She placed ninth in the triple jump at the 1995 Canadian Track and Field Championships in Montreal. Later, as a collegiate cyclist, she attended Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas, obtaining a Master of Science degree in biology. 
Hannos first raced her bike in 1996 and a year later was selected by Cycling Canada for the 1997 Tour Cycliste Féminin, the women's version of the Tour de France. She represented Canada at the 1998 XVI Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and was the only Canadian cyclist to compete in four events—the road race, individual time trial, individual pursuit and points race. In the points race, she won the final sprint to finish in a three-way tie for fourth place but, after tie-breaking procedures, officially finished in sixth place.
Hannos has many career wins including gold in the criterium at the 2002 Canadian National Road Cycling Championships, one of ten career Canadian national championship medals. She notably finished third overall in general classification (GC) at the 2002 Redlands Bicycle Classic in California.
Coached by her father, Sandor (Alex) Hannos, an accomplished cyclist originally from Hungary, Hannos often trained and raced with her younger sister. In 1998, the sisters were recruited by Midwestern State University and offered athletic scholarships to race for the school cycling team. Over the next few years, the sisters won a total of nine US collegiate national championship (division I) events on the road and on the velodrome for Midwestern State University. Both sisters also raced for the American cycling team, Verizon Wireless, in 2001.
Hannos retired from professional cycling at the end of 2004 after racing three seasons for the UCI team Équipe Cycliste RONA from Québec. In 2011, she helped manage the Vancouver-based Trek Red Truck p/b Mosaic Homes Women's Cycling Team alongside mountain bike cross country Olympic silver medalist, Alison Sydor.

Greek coinage of Italy and Sicily

Greek coinage of Italy and Sicily originated from local Italiotes and Siceliotes who formed numerous city states. These Hellenistic communities descended from Greek migrants. Southern Italy was so thoroughly hellenized that it was known as the Magna Graecia. Each of the polities struck their own coinage.
Taras (or Tarentum) was among the most prominent city states.
By the second century BC some of these Greek coinages evolved under Roman rule, and can be classified as the first Roman provincial currencies.
Themes and design.
A common theme in the Italiote coinage was to include portraits of gods or other mythological figures. Some featured animals and other symbols. For instance, the coins of Sybaris (Thurium) portrayed goddess Minerva. Inhabitants of Kroton (Crotone) adorned their coinage with images of Hercules. The city of Posidonia (Paestum) had received its name from Greek god Poseidon whose portrait they struck in their coinage. The city was founded by Sybarite colonists, and observes of Posidonian coinage included a symbol of their parent city, the bull. Taras, the most prosperous city state, struck coinage with dolphins and seahorses. The winged seahorse refers to Poseidon. A certain unusual coin from Neapolis (Naples) portrayed a bull with a human face. One theory for its origin is that it may have celebrated some sort of an alliance with the Romans. The city of Gelas in Sicily was founded by Rhodian settlers. It was originally known as Lindii after their home town Lindos, but the city was renamed after the river Gelas. They struck coinage with depictions of the local river god.
Some tyrants in Magna Graecia advertised their victories in the Olympic Games by striking coinage that referred to these specific achievements.
Style of figures in coins can be compared to pottery from the region. This gives clues about when the pottery in question was made. Furthermore, ages of the cities such Sybaris are well known.
Weight standard.
The weights of silver coinage were inherited from Corinthian merchants. Commercial ties between Corinth and Taras were tight-knit. This brought the Persian weight standard for gold coinage to Magna Graecia. Phocaean standard had also been in use in the region. Later, Aeginetic standard appeared and was briefly used. It had been brought to southern Italy by Chalcidian settlers. Cities in the region eventually adopted the Attic standard.
Sicilian (or Macedonian) talent was used for gold rather than a heavier talent used in mainland Greece.
Magna Graecia.
The region of Magna Graecia included originally Greek cities such as Cumae, Herakleia, Kaulonia, Kroton, Lokroi, Neapolis, Metapontum, Sybaris, Taras, Thurii and Rhegion.
The cities of Taras, Metapontum, Sybaris and Kroton were founded between c. 750 BC – c. 650 BC, and it is likely that they brought their knowledge of recently invented minting straight from their home cities.
Taras.
Coins of Taras from the 4th century BC picture a mounted cavalryman equipped with a shield. At that time no other Greek military equipped cavalry with shields. It can be deduced that the influence of Taras may have been responsible for the spread of shielded cavalry to other Greek polities.
Throughout the Greek world it was common that weight standards of Hellenistic coinage decreased in weight over time. One explanation is that, as worn money circulated back to the issuing state, the worn coins were recoined. More noticeable reductions in weight can be occasionally attributed to a single event. During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) coinage of Taras decreased in size noticeably, and the war also impacted coinage of certain other Greek polities in Italy. Silver coinage of Taras, Kroton, Herakleia, Thurii and Metapontum were 7.9 g in weight before the war, but decreased in weight and size to 6.6 g. Subsequent issue of Tarantine coins also suffered from debasement of five percent. This downward evolution was significantly affected by the financial strain caused by warfare for the Greek polities. For instance, countering the expansion of Rome caused considerable pressure for the Italiote city states.
Sicily.
Naxos was the oldest Greek city on the island. Chalcidean settlers founded the city in 735 BC. It was also the first city on the island to issue coinage. The city grew rich from producing wine, and it honoured the god Dionysos on their first coinage. Satyrs were another common theme on their coinage. Katana, founded in 730 BC by colonists moving out of the city of Naxos, was known for its masterful engravers whose work resulted in very fine coinage. Dionysios I, tyrant of Syracuse, destroyed the city of Naxos in 403 BC. Survivors from Naxos founded the city of Tauromenion in 358 BC.
Himera and Zancle were two other early issuers of coinage on the island of Sicily. They were also founded by Chalcidean settlers. Nacona was a small Greek town in Sicily the existence of which, at an unknown location, is confirmed by coins bearing the legend "NAKONAION", or "ΝΑΚΩΝΑΙΩΝ”. 
During the 4th century BC coinage became scarce. Punic coins and Corinthian staters were the principal currencies in circulation. Carthaginian expansion in Sicily caused this disruption of the local monetary system. However, native Sicilian coinage lost even more ground during the 3rd century BC and largely disappeared. The Second Punic War was the cause of this latter disruption. Only rarely bronze coins were struck. The Second Punic War had similar effects in the Southern Italy.
Syracuse.
In the 6th century BC Syracuse began minting its own coinage. They used Attic-Euboic weight standard, and it was rapidly adopted by the other polities of Sicily. In the 5th century a strong government and widely militarized society ruled by tyrants left behind abundant coinage.
Roman provincial currency.
By 210 BC Rome was controlling all of the Greek cities in the region. At the beginning of the next century a clear Roman influence on the Greek coinage can be noticed. Both iconography and style of the coins had changed. Greek coinage from this period can be classified as the first instances of Roman provincial currency.

Operation Ramrod 16

Ramrod 16 was an attempt by the Royal Air Force to bomb the Koninklijke Hoogovens (Royal Blast Furnaces) steelworks at IJmuiden in the Netherlands during the Second World War. After several recent abortive attacks a more elaborate plan was made for six Douglas Boston IIIA light bombers of 107 Squadron to attack again, with a Ramrod as a diversion. (Ramrod was the Royal Air Force (RAF) term for bomber operations intended to induce fighters into action for British fighter escorts to attack.) Ramrod 16 was to be flown by twelve Lockheed Ventura Mk II bombers of No. 487 Squadron RNZAF against the Hemweg power station in Amsterdam, not far up river from IJmuiden.
Thirteen Spitfire squadrons from 11 Group, Fighter Command, were to fly Rodeo 212 to Vlissingen (Flushing), to the south-west of Amsterdam, as another diversion. The Venturas were to be escorted by three squadrons of Spitfires from 12 Group, Fighter Command. Two squadrons of high-flying Spitfire Mk IXs were to wait off the Dutch coast, available for contingencies and eight Mustang fighters were to protect the Bostons on their return from IJmuiden, three more Spitfire squadrons covering the return of the Venturas.
The raid began in the late afternoon of 3 May 1943 but Rodeo 212 arrived early and at height, alerting the Germans. The first three 107 Squadron Bostons missed the IJmuiden steelworks but the second formation obtained direct hits. The Venturas of 487 Squadron got ahead of most of their escort and met an unexpectedly large number of German fighters, the local contingent having, by coincidence, having been temporarily been reinforced. All but one of the Venturas were shot down before bombing and a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter was shot down by the last Ventura, flown by Squadron Leader Leonard Trent, whose bombs overshot the power station; Trent was shot down moments later.
Morale of the three Ventura squadrons in 2 Group was severely shaken by the losses but 487 Squadron was rebuilt, returned to operations at the end of the month and was re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquitos later in the year. The full story of the raid became known when Trent was repatriated from a German prison camp in 1945. Trent was awarded a Victoria Cross and his navigator, Flight Lieutenant Vivian Phillips, received a Distinguished Service Order.
Background.
Bomber Command, 1939.
On 4 September 1939, five out of ten Bristol Blenheim bombers were shot down making low-level attacks on German warships in daylight, along with two out of fourteen Vickers Wellington bombers. On 29 September, five Handley-Page Hampden bombers flew another raid against German warships and all were shot down. Few operations were possible in October and November due to weather but on 3 December, 24 Wellingtons were sent to attack German ships. The Wellingtons were intercepted by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters and engaged by German anti-aircraft guns (); no bombers were lost and one Bf 109 was claimed shot down, later confirmed by German records. On 14 December, Wellingtons made another attack and five were shot down, another crashing in England. On 18 December, 22 Wellingtons attacked again, flying at to evade , thought to be the main cause of recent losses. Flying at higher altitude and taking a longer route to avoid neutral territory, the Wellingtons were easier to detect by German radar. Around 100 German fighters were scrambled to intercept the bombers and the Wellingtons were intercepted by cannon-armed Bf 110s and machine-gun armed Bf 109Ds. In what became known as the Battle of the Heligoland Bight, eleven Wellingtons were shot down, one ditched in the North Sea and six crashed in England. Only one group of Wellingtons had bombed, the other had refrained to avoid civilian casualties; the Germans lost three fighters to return fire.
The extent of the loss "stunned" RAF leaders, exploding their belief that tight formations of bombers, equipped with machine-gun turrets, could defeat attack by day fighters. From January 1940, the Wellington and Hampden day bombers joined the specialist Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley night bombers in flying leaflet-dropping missions over Germany. The Fairey Battle and Blenheim light day bombers of the Advanced Air Striking Force in France and 2 Group in England also devoted considerable time to night-flying training. During the Battle of France the AASF and 2 Group flew day and night sorties, the Battles of the AASF suffering losses of 75 per cent by day from 10 to 14 May and 0.5 per cent by night. During the battle, the AASF lost 137 Battles and 37 Blenheims; 2 Group lost 98 Blenheims.
Leaning forward into France.
Following its victory in the Battle of Britain, 1940, Fighter Command began sending fighter squadrons over northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands to engage the . The policy was known as "Leaning forward into France" and begun by Air Chief Marshal Sholto Douglas, who had replaced Hugh Dowding as Air Officer Commanding in chief of Fighter Command on 25 November 1940. From December 1940, 11 Group flew Rhubarbs, raids by two or three fighters attacking targets of opportunity; Rodeos, fighter sweeps over enemy territory without bombers, which the usually ignored and Circuses, small numbers of bombers from 2 Group, escorted by large numbers of fighters. The objective of the operations was to attack ground targets, destroy any fighters which opposed the raids and keep them in Western Europe. Ramrods were bomber sorties escorted by fighters, primarily intended to destroy a ground target and inflict losses by the escorts on German fighters trying to intervene.
From December 1940 to June 1941, Fighter Command flew 104 Rhubarbs and eleven Circuses. In Bomber Command only 2 Group still flew day bombers and Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, beginning on 22 June, gave the group added significance. The withdrew its squadrons from coastal airfields to bases further inland, from where they could decline combat or engage RAF fighters in places where the British fighters were at a tactical disadvantage for lack of fuel. To force the to transfer fighter units from the Eastern Front and to inflict damage on communications in the west, the offensive over France was increased, Fighter Command devoting about a third of its aircraft to the operations until the end of the year. The effort was a failure, no German fighters being transferred from the USSR to reinforce the two (fighter groups) in the west. The Fighter Command loss was 51 pilots by June 1941 but another 411 were lost by years' end, a greater loss than July to October 1940.
Fighter Command made "enormously exaggerated estimates of German losses", from June to the end of December 1941 claiming 731 aircraft against a real loss of 154 aircraft, 51 of which were not lost to RAF action. By late January 1942, transfers of day fighters and anti-aircraft units had been identified by the British and Ultra decryption of German signals coded with the Enigma machine uncovered the transfer of 30 of the newest German fighter type to the Russian front and 40 from the Pas de Calais to northern Norway for anti-convoy operations. The day offensive resumed on 24 March 1942 and received a vigorous reply from the ; by 19 April, Ultra decrypts had revealed a reinforcement of the western air front, of the 180 single-engined fighters in the Pas de Calais, 120 were the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190, which outclassed the Spitfire Mk V.
By mid-June, Fighter Command had suffered 259 losses for the loss of 58 German fighters, against Fighter Command claims to have destroyed 197. On 6 July, Ultra revealed that the was struggling to supply aircraft to north Africa, had imposed limits on operations in Russia and ordered a vast increase in fighter output from the , which was taken to mean that the Fighter Command offensive had greatly contributed to the German difficulties. The offensive continued at a lesser rate, to tie down Fw 190 units and to maintain a measure of air superiority along the Channel coast, until the maximum effort during the Dieppe Raid (19 August 1942). In 2 Group, obsolete Blenheim bombers began to be replaced by faster and more versatile Douglas Boston, Lockheed Ventura and de Havilland Mosquito day bombers.
Prelude.
2 Group raids.
The three squadrons of 2 Group equipped with Douglas Bostons began replacing their aircraft with new Boston Mk IIIAs in March 1943, flying training sorties and sea search operations. The first squadron to resume offensive operations was 107 Squadron on 1 May; Caen was attacked but the raid was thwarted by cloud cover. On 2 May, 107 Squadron attacked the Koninklijke Hoogovens (Royal Blast Furnaces) steelworks at IJmuiden on the coast, missed the works but hit barges and dock installations nearby. Spitfire Mk IXe fighters of 331 (Norwegian) Squadron claimed three Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighters. The Venturas of No. 464 Squadron RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) also attacked the steel works, escorted by the Spitfire Vbs of 118 Squadron. The bombers flew the usual wave top height approach over the North Sea then made a battle climb (a fast climb to bombing height). The Venturas received moderate as they attacked, also missed the steelworks but hit the coking works, sulphate plant and other ancillary works, along with three ships, two of which sank. The Venturas were caught out on the return journey by Fw 190s, which damaged two of the bombers for two Fw 190s claimed shot down by the escorts.
Plan.
"Ramrod" 16 was another attempt on the IJmuiden steelworks by six Boston IIIAs with a diversion provided by twelve Ventura Mk II bombers of No. 487 Squadron RNZAF on 3 May. In bright blue skies, sunshine and a warm day the fourteen crews of 487 Squadron were briefed for the raid at RAF Methwold their base in Norfolk. The crews were told that they were to attack the Hemweg power station at the north end of Amsterdam, about from IJmuiden, to "encourage the Dutch resistance to resist German pressure in Holland and to aid Dutch workmen in organising disobedience". Twelve aircraft were to fly on the operation with three Spitfire squadrons as close escort. The Ventura crews were told to expect determined opposition but to press on at all costs. B Flight, 487 Squadron, led by its commander, Squadron Leader Leonard Trent and the deputy flight commander, Flight Lieutenant A. V. Duffill, was to be followed by A Flight, the result of a coin toss with the A Flight commander, Squadron Leader Jack Meakin. The plan was to bomb at dusk for the Venturas to benefit from the declining visibility and return under cover of the dark.
The Venturas were to rendezvous over RAF Coltishall at at an altitude lower than with the Spitfire Mk Vs of the close escort comprising 118 Squadron, 167 Squadron and 504 Squadron. The Spitfire Mark IX had a performance similar to that of the Messersmitt Bf 109G and Focke Wulf 190A fighters but only ten Fighter Command squadrons had been equipped with it by mid-1943, due to shortage of engines and despatches to overseas squadrons. Most domestic Spitfire squadrons were left flying obsolete Mk Vs, restricted to close escort of bombers. The bombers were to fly at Indicated airspeed (IAS) for 33 minutes across the North Sea, keeping below German radar until they were ten minutes from the Dutch coast, perform a battle climb (a fast and steep climb) at to and head straight for the target to retain a degree of surprise. Fighter Command operations to protect bombers consisted of target support (or forward support) a sweep by fighter squadrons kept available for contingencies, close escort with the bombers, high cover for the close escort and rear support to escort the bombers home and engage any German fighters remaining, when the other escorts were low on fuel and ammunition.
Target support was to be provided by the Supermarine Spitfire Mk IXbs of 122 Squadron and No. 453 Squadron RAAF flying a sweep along the coast west of the Ventura approach route. Thirteen fighter squadrons from 11 Group were to fly "Rodeo" 212 towards Vlissingen (Flushing) on the island of Walcheren to the south-west as a diversion. Rear support (waiting just off the coast) by three Spitfire squadrons to protect the Venturas on their return journey, was to arrive in relays and orbit (circle) west of Zandvoort; seven Spitfire Vbs and Vcs of 302 (Polish) Squadron were to arrive at returning at , twelve Spitfire Vbs of 306 (Polish) Squadron were to take over at departing at and twelve Spitfires of 308 (Polish) Squadron arriving from were to turn for home at Two relays of 613 Squadron North American Mustang Mk Is were to cover the withdrawal of 107 Squadron, four Mustangs arriving at and returning at the second four arriving at and turning for home at 
Raid.
The twelve Venturas took off from RAF Methwold at in clear weather but after five minutes "Q-Queenie", flown by Sergeant A. G. Barker, turned back due to a fault with the escape hatch. The eleven remaining Venturas rendezvoused a few minutes later with the Spitfire escorts of the Coltishall Wing over RAF Coltishall nearer the coast. The Bostons of 464 Squadron also set off from Coltishall, flying much lower than the Venturas. Trent led the first six Venturas in a tight box formation, with the second group, led by Meakin, following. Thirteen fighter squadrons from 11 Group flying "Rodeo" 212 got their timing wrong and arrived at Vlissingen, to the south-west of Amsterdam, thirty minutes early, appearing on German radar and alerting the German fighter units. The Target Support Spitfire Mk IXbs of 122 Squadron and 453 Squadron RAAF were recalled at when at , west of Zandvoort.
By coincidence, the fighters in the Netherlands had been reinforced during a visit to Haarlem by the of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart. A conference was scheduled for that day at Schiphol airfield near Amsterdam and a great number of experienced fighter pilots were in attendance from other parts of the Western Front. The six Boston IIIAs of 107 Squadron had taken off at and around bombed the IJmuiden steel works in two vic formations of three aircraft each, the first vic hitting the ancillary switch and transformer stations, despite making their bomb runs at "nought feet". Bf 109 fighters and Fw 190 fighters intercepted the first vic as it re-crossed the coast but the evasive action of the Bostons enabled them to escape without loss. The second vic, attacking through intense released their bombs and hit the steel works, turned for home and ran into the German fighters, which shot down BZ227, the Boston flown by Flight Sergeant F. S. Harrop in flames; the other two Bostons escaped, noting a Ventura coming down in the water, apparently lost with all hands.
The eleven Venturas climbed at just before reaching the Dutch coast with the three close escort Spitfire VB squadrons but 504 Squadron lagged by . When the bombers reached the target was visible ahead in the clear sky. As a precaution against a possible British attack on Seyss-Inquart, the German fighters were ordered off the ground and climbed at about the same time as the Venturas. German fighters were scrambled at from Woensdrecht Airfield and were vectored to intercept the incoming formation off the coast. The German fighters included 24 Fw 190 fighters from II. (2nd Group) of "Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JG 1, 1st Fighter Wing) and eight Bf 109 fighters from 2. (2nd Squadron) of "Jagdgeschwader" 27 (JG 27, 27th Fighter Wing). The fighters were led by (Captain) Dietrich Wickop, the (group commander) of II./JG 1.
Over the coast more than twenty German fighters from the three of fell on 504 and 167 squadrons of the close escort as thirty more headed for the Venturas. The Spitfires of 504 Squadron were still climbing when Fw 190s swept overhead and cut them off from the Venturas. The commander of the Coltishall Wing, Wing Commander Howard "Cowboy" Blatchford, tried to warn the bombers but they had already been surrounded by German fighters. A dog-fight began with Fw 190s diving on 167 Squadron; 504 Squadron, still climbing in the rear, did a 360° turn to lure the Fw 190s to no avail; 118 Squadron got as far as the west end of Amsterdam and was credited with two Fw 190s, 167 Squadron another. Blatchford's Spitfire was badly damaged and he came down in the sea off Mundesley; his body was never found.
The Ventura flown by Duffill was one of the first to be hit; cannon-fire destroyed the hydraulics, set both engines alight and seriously wounded the two gunners, after one had claimed a fighter. Duffill turned for home, followed by two A Flight Venturas, which were quickly shot down. Attacked by German fighters until well out over the North Sea, Duffill managed to keep the Ventura airborne and the navigator jettisoned the bombs. The fires died down and Duffill reached Methwold to land safely (the gunners were rushed to Ely Hospital and the crew was awarded immediate decorations). Within minutes of crossing the coast the Venturas were reduced to five aircraft; Flying Officer O. E. Foster was the pilot of one of the five aircraft left to begin the bomb run.
Foster saw the two Venturas in front of his aircraft explode and moments later his Ventura was hit and the bomb doors fell off, followed by the bombs. Foster turned for home and his Ventura was hit by anti-aircraft fire, which knocked out the starboard engine. Foster dived to avoid the German fighters but the ammunition containers for his forward-firing guns began to explode and blew the nose off. The navigator, Flying Officer T. A. Penn, was badly wounded and the rear gunner, Flight-Sergeant T. W. J. Warner was mortally wounded but got forward to report that his turret was out of action before he died. Foster managed to pull the Ventura out of a dive towards a harbour, only to find that he was in the middle of a German convoy. Foster cleared the ships but his controls were damaged and he could barely keep the Ventura in the air as he re-crossed the Dutch coast. The Ventura was leaking fuel and Foster ordered ditching stations; the port engine failed and the Ventura crashed into the sea and quickly sank. Foster, Penn and the wireless operator Sergeant R. W. Mann struggled out of the submerged aircraft. One of the crew recounted,
The German patrol boat picked up the three survivors a couple of hours after the crash.
The last four Venturas were met by massed anti-aircraft fire while still under attack by the Bf 109s which followed them into the . One of the German fighters overshot the Venturas and crossed in front Trent, giving him a chance to fire at it with his fixed twin nose guns. The Messerschmitt was caught by the short burst and was seen to go down in flames. Trent later said he was surprised the German pilots would pursue them through such heavy . Approaching the target at , Trent saw his wingman shot down, followed directly by the other two aircraft. Pressing on to the target, Trent released his bombs and turned for home but as he did so his aircraft was hit again, went into a sharp spin and broke apart. Trent and his navigator, Flight Lieutenant Vivian Phillips, were thrown clear of the wreckage in mid-air and pulled their parachute ripcords but the other two crew members were unable to get free and died when the Ventura crashed into Kometon Polder; Trent and his navigator survived and were taken prisoner. Between and JG 1 claimed ten aircraft and Max Winkler from 2./JG 27 claimed a Ventura shot down north of Amsterdam, for three II./JG 1 Fw 190s shot down and two pilots killed.
Aftermath.
Analysis.
The 487 Squadron roll was called on 6 May and mustered only six crews and eight aircraft; it was the fourth time that a squadron had been almost annihilated in one operation. Morale in 464 Squadron, another Ventura squadron, was as severely affected as that of 487 Squadron by the losses, especially since the squadron to go on the operation had been decided by the flip of a coin.
Casualties.
Of the twelve 487 Squadron Venturas sent on the mission, the only survivors were the crew of the aircraft from the first box which had turned back with a damaged escape hatch (it broke free when the Ventura landed and jammed in the rudder) and Duffill's aircraft from the second box, which was damaged beyond repair and written off; few aircrew in the nine Venturas shot down on their approach to the target survived. Some hope was offered by fighter pilots on "Ramrod" 16 who had reported seeing seven parachutes. The 487 Squadron diarist recorded,
A wounded air gunner, Flight Sergeant Urlich, was pushed out of his burning aircraft by his pilot, Flying Officer McGowan and the navigator, Flying Officer Thornber, who were killed soon afterwards, when the bomber exploded.
Urlich wrote later,
 Ernst Heesen from 5./JG 1 and Willi Pfeiffer from 4./JG 1 were killed in action. Heesen had been credited with 32 aerial victories and was the leading fighter pilot in II./JG 1. Georg Hutter was also shot down, and made a forced landing at Haarlem, the aircraft being written off. Heesen may have been shot down by Sergeant R. J. Flight from 118 Squadron.
Subsequent operations.
The attack on the Ijmuiden steel works by 107 Squadron was followed up by "Circuses" to Abbeville, Cherbourg and Poix. On 15 May, two Boston formations hit the runway and dispersals at Drucat north-east of Abbeville. "En route" for home, between Poix and Le Touquet, the Bostons were attacked by Bf 109s and Fw 190s. The fighters escorting the Bostons claimed two Bf 109s and Flight Sergeant Kindle, rear gunner of the squadron CO, R. G. England, claimed two fighters damaged. One Boston landed at RAF Detling with a punctured fuel tank and another came down in a field near East Peckham in Kent.
Squadron Leader Alan Wilson took command 487 Squadron which was re-built to a complement of 21 crews; on 23 May the squadron attacked coking ovens at Zeebrugge against scant opposition. On 28 May the King, George VI, came to RAF Methwold to pay his respects and meet fourteen crews from each squadron on the base. A few days later Sir Archibald Sinclair, the Secretary of State for Air, paid a visit to inspect the re-building; 464 Squadron bombed Carpiquet airfield near Caen on the same day. At the end of May, 2 Group left Bomber Command to join the new Second Tactical Air Force and came under Fighter Command control, until the formation of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, five months later. In August 487 Squadron converted to the de Havilland Mosquito; the squadron joined the new 140 Wing and went on to participate in the Amiens prison raid (Operation Jericho).
Leonard Trent.
After his capture, Trent took part in the mass escape by tunnel from Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Lower Silesia in Germany, in March 1944. During the preparations for what became known as the Great Escape. Trent was one of the men responsible for disposal of sand taken from the tunnel; Trent also acted as a security officer to prevent the Germans learning of what was afoot. During the escape, Trent passed through the tunnel and emerged from the hole outside the camp wire when a patrolling sentry discovered the men waiting to crawl away into the woods and alerted the camp guards. After being repatriated and returning to 487 Squadron, Trent reported,
Awards.
For their actions on Ramrod 16, Trent was awarded a Victoria Cross at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 12 April 1946 and Phillips was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Following the war Trent spent a short amount of time in the New Zealand Air Force before returning to the RAF, where he completed his career, reaching the rank of Group Captain.

DUS III Ptapta

The D.U.S. III Ptapta was a two-seat sports and touring biplane and only the second Polish aircraft using aluminium alloy construction.
Design and development.
The Ptapta was designed by Jerzy Dabrowski and Antoni Uszacki (hence the design group name D.U.S. or DUS) and was strongly influenced by the Skraba S.T.3, flown in 1927. In that year Dabrowski and Uszacki led a group of employees from the Plage and Laskiewicz factory, who in 1928 formed the Lubelski Klub Lotniczy (Lublian Aviation Club), referring to the Ptapta as the LKL I. The factory allowed use of their workshop and the LOPP provided funding and loaned an engine. It flew for the first time either on 21 September 1928 by Antoni Mroczkowski or 10 October. With a light load it could be flown aerobatically.
The largely aluminium-alloy framed Ptapta was a biplane with a larger span and chord upper wing. Both upper and lower wings were built around two duralumin spars, with wooden ribs and fabric covering. They were rectangular in plan apart from slightly angled tips and mounted with marked stagger. Only the upper wings carried ailerons. The upper and lower wings were braced together with a single interplane strut with flared ends on each side and the upper wing was attached to the fuselage centrally by a pair of transverse cabane inverted V-struts to the spars.
Its Walter NZ 60 five-cylinder radial engine was installed, with its cylinders exposed for cooling, in a pointed nose where the oval section duralumin fuselage structure was covered in dural sheet. A long cut-out in the fuselage with dural decking ahead of it contained the two open tandem cockpits. The forward position was under the wing trailing edge, in which a cut-out provided a better field of view and eased access. Elsewhere the fuselage was fabric covered. The Ptpta's fin was triangular in profile and carried a deep, rectangular rudder. A triangular tailplane carried rectangular elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement; it was placed at the top of the fuselage and braced from below by a single strut on each side.
The Ptapta had conventional, tailskid landing gear of the divided type, with mainwheels on cranked axles from the central fuselage underside, with trailing struts acting as radius arms and vertical main legs equipped with rubber shock absorbers.
Operational history.
Some six weeks after its first flight the Ptapta took part in the Second National Lightplane Contest, again flown by Mroczkowski. It finished in eighth place.
In the summer of 1929 the Ptapta was modified by the removal and covering-over of the front cockpit and its replacement by a large fuel tank to allow an attempt on the lightplane distance record. The extra fuel gave a calculated range of though, as the record was soon broken by others, yet more fuel was required. A newer, , Walter NZ engine was also fitted. Before attempting the record flight the Ptapta took part in October 1929 in the First Tour of Southwestern Poland and then, flown by Władysław Szulczewski, made a trial endurance flight which was curtailed by bad weather. A record attempt was made on 30 April 1930 but ended immediately in the destruction of the very heavily loaded aircraft, which stalled on take-off from Poznań. Other accounts of this loss give different dates and places.

EORI number

An Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI number) is a European Union registration and identification number for businesses which undertake the import or export of goods into or out of the EU.
Any business or individual established in the EU (an economic operator) needs to obtain an EORI number from their national customs authority before commencing customs activities in the EU. EORI is an abbreviation for Economic Operators Registration and Identification. An economic operator established outside the EU needs to be assigned an EORI number if it intends to lodge a customs declaration, an Entry or an Exit Summary Declaration. Authorized economic operators in particular need to have an EORI number. EORI numbers can be validated online.
The EORI system was established in order to implement the security measures introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the council. The European Commission notes that traders themselves have been calling for a common numbering system which is unique to each individual and valid throughout the European Union since mandatory identification codes for traders were introduced by Regulation 2286/20032. The commission's EORI2 project aims to update the existing system with additional elements required by the Union Customs Code Delegated Act, relating to whether the trader is established in the European Union or in a third country.

He attended Columbus, Texas public schools and graduated from the University of Texas in 1910 with an LL.B. He married Kitty Mae Stamps of Seguin in 1913. 
In 1917 Wirtz and his family moved to Seguin, Texas where he practiced law until 1934. Wirtz served as the Guadalupe County State Senator from 1922 to 1930. He served as the President Pro Tempore of the Texas Senate from 1925 to 1927. During his time in Seguin, Wirtz became involved in a group of citizens interested in developing the Guadalupe River as a source of Hydroelectric power. Wirtz provided legal assistance to the Insull holding company Emery, Peck, and Rockwood as they built a chain of privately owned dams and hydroelectric projects on the Guadalupe River. In 1932 Wirtz was assisting the Emery, Peck, and Rockwood in a similar project on the Colorado River when the Insull empire collapsed. As a result, Wirtz was made receiver of the uncompleted Hamilton Dam. To complete the dam, Wirtz promoted the creation of the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). He wrote the state legislation that created the Authority, pushed for federal funding for the Authority's dams through the federal Public Works Administration along with James P. Buchanan and Lyndon B Johnson. As the "father of the LCRA," Wirtz helped create a program to fund an uncompleted dam on the Colorado River which would eventually become the Mansfield Dam.

Revolt (Wild Fire album)

Revolt is the debut album of the American rock band Wild Fire. It was released on May 23, 2017 and was produced, mixed, and mastered by Matt LaPlant, who also sang backing vocals for some of the tracks and worked with the band for their previous works. The album consists of 15 tracks, "Villain", which was the first single to be released from the album, being the most successful track on the album: The song's official lyric video has had over 426,880 views on YouTube, and been streamed more than 600,000 times on Spotify. In total, all the videos containing the song on YouTube have more than three million views. The single peaked at number 82 on the Media Base Rock Charts in the third quarter of 2017. The album's final track is a cover of "The Cover of Rolling Stone", which was written by Shel Silverstein.
Some of the songs on the album were written and recorded for previous albums but were included on the album anyway. During the Cathercist era of the band, they released an album called "As Hope Expires" on May 24, 2013. It consisted of eight tracks, four of which appear on "Revolt".
Songs.
Villain.
"Villain" is the first single and the most successful track on "Revolt" since its release on November 15, 2015 (later May 23, 2017 on the album), with over 600,000 streams on Spotify and three million views, in total, on every YouTube video that contains the song. The single also peaked at number 82 on the Media Base Rock Charts in the third quarter of 2017.
The song is written by lead vocalist and pianist Zack Sawyer, and former lead guitarist Taylor Roberts cites The Joker as an inspiration. Roberts said: 
While I'm not the author of the lyrics for "Villain", the song is about, well, being the villain. We all have that side of us, deep down somewhere. That side of you is there whether you want to believe that or not and sometimes its just itching to break out and take control. Another aspect for inspiration, at least on my side of things, would definitely be the Joker. If you watch the lyric video, the main focus of the video is the Joker, the lyrics to me describe the insanity and utter villainy that the Joker exudes [...]
"Villain" is the fifth track on the album and it has its own lyric music video on YouTube. Part of the lyrics in the original single, which was removed in the album version, is sang growling and it became the inspiration to name the band Wild Fire: "I illuminate the night / I bring chaos to the empire / wildfire burning bright." The band chose to leave out the growling part in the album version and simply replace it with an instrumental break.

Leandro Arrúe Agudo

Bishop Leandro Arrúe Agudo, O.A.R., was the second Bishop of Jaro. He was born in Calatayud, Zaragoza, Spain, on 13 January 1837. He took vows as a professed religious in 1856, in Monteagudo, Navarre , as Fray Leandro Arrué de San Nicolás de Tolentino, in 1865.
Priestly Ministry as a Friar in the Philippines.
Fray Leandro Arrué started his missionary work in the Philippines in 1860 upon his arrival in Manila in July of that year. On 22 September 1860, he was ordained a priest of the Augustinian Recollect Order. After his ordination, he was sent to Cagayan de Oro to study the Cebuano language in the year 1861, and was sent to be the Parish Priest of Bacong in Negros Island in 1864. 
While in Bacong, Fray Leandro built the parish rectory. He also started the construction of the stone church in 1866. From Bacong, he temporarily administered the former town of Sum-ag for some months in 1868, after which, he was appointed Parish Priest of Liloan, Cebu, in September of that year. He stayed in Liloan until May 1873. His subsequent responsibilities included being Procurator General of his Order in Manila, and Prior of the Immaculate Conception Convent in Cebu. 
Fray Arrué was also elected to the three-year term as Prior Provincial of the Augustinian Recollects in the Phiippines, in 1879. Having been much sought after by the people of Bacong, he returned to Negros after serving as the Head of the Philippine Province of his Order. He was able to finish the parish church of Bacong within his second term as curate of the town. The first Mass was celebrated in this place of worship on 28 August 1883, the Feast of St. Augustine, Bacong's Patron Saint. 
Ministry as Bishop of Jaro.
The Augustinian Friar distinguished himself in the work for pastoral care of souls in the Philippines. He was zealous in his ecclesiastical ministry. Pope Leo XIII recognized these qualities of Fray Leandro, when the Roman Pontiff appointed him Bishop of Jaro, on 27 March 1885. On 30 August of that year, he was consecrated by Pedro Payo y Piñeiro, O.P., Archbishop of Manila, as Principal Consecrator. The two Principal Co-Consecrators were Mariano Cuartero y Sierra, O.A.R., Bishop of Nueva Segovia; and Bernabé García Cezón, O.P., Titular Bishop of Byblus and Vicar Apostolic of Central Tonking and Vietnam. 
The exemplary zeal of this Recollect Bishop moved his to tirelessly visit the faithful and clergy of his jurisdiction which, in those days, covered extensives territories comprising the islands of Panay, (now composed of the provinces of Iloilo, Capiz, Antique and Aklan), Guimaras, Negros (now the twin provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental), Romblon and Palawan, as well as the provinces of Cotabato, Zamboanga, Davao and Sulu in Mindanao. Known for his generosity, unblemished character and great managerial skills, Bishop Arrué took special care of the spiritual and temporal needs of the people of his Diocese. He preached God’s Word in all the churches of his Diocese, and also constructed a hospital for the ailing and the destitute. 
Bishop Leandro Arrué passed away on 24 October 1897. His remains were buried in the Cathedral Church of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, which is now popularly known as the Jaro Cathedral.

Champs Boxing

Champs Boxing was a series of boxing matches that took place in Fort Worth, Texas during 2002 and 2003. The boxing events were created to supplement Telefutura’s programming when the network moved to a 24-hour schedule. The boxing matches took place on Saturday night, and aired later in the week to round out TeleFutura’s growing need for programming content. TeleFutura had large Friday Night boxing programming, but the demand was to add several smaller events throughout the week.
Tommy Habeeb, Leslie Norris, and Dustin Hodge were the producers and produced the events through Tommy Habeeb Enterprises, before later moving to producing MMA events for the Art of War Undisputed Arena Fighting Championship.
Kendrick Releford and America Santos were two of the more well known boxers on the events. The fights were sanctioned by the Texas Combative Sports Program.
History.
Champs Boxing held six events.
The first event, Gonzalez vs Guereca, was on October 11, 2002 at the Ramada Plaza in Fort Worth, Texas. The headliner was Jesse Gonzales vs Bernardo Guereca.
The second event, Gonzalez vs Herrera took place November 7, 2002 at the Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth, Texas. The headliner was Jesse Gonzales vs Rene Franciso Herrera. The event also featured Kendrick Releford vs Andrew Greeley.
The third event, Gonzalez vs Suarez took place March 8, 2003 at the Pequeno Mexico Event Building in Fort Worth, Texas. The headliner was Jesse Gonzales vs Eloy Suarez. This event was broadcast on TeleFutura. 
The fourth event, Gonzalez vs Sandoval took place May 31, 2003 at the Hooters in Fort Worth, Texas. The headliner was Jesse Gonzales vs Norberto Sandoval. This event was broadcast on TeleFutura. 
The fifth event, Vasquez vs Barron took place August 8, 2003 at the Worthington Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas. The headliner was Gabriel Vasquez vs Rogelio Barron. This event was broadcast on TeleFutura. 
The final event, Santos vs Trigg took place September 9, 2003 at the Penthouse Club in Dallas, Texas. The headliner was Americo Santos vs John Trigg. This event was broadcast on TeleFutura.

Hunters Point social uprising (1966)

The Hunters Point social uprising (also known as the Hunters Point Riot or Rebellion) broke out in the Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco on the night of September 27, 1966, after San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) officer Alvin Johnson shot and killed Matthew Johnson, a teenager who was fleeing the scene of a stolen car. The National Guard and California Highway Patrol (CHP) were deployed late that night by Governor Pat Brown, and martial law was imposed until October 1.
Events.
Although an account of the events that unfolded in Hunters Point in late September 1966 is contained in the report "128 Hours", Arthur Hippler has criticized the report as biased favorably towards police actions, noting it omitted several important details, such as the incident when the police shot into the Bayview Community Center on September 28.
Contributing factors.
Some of the primary contributing factors that have been cited are the poverty, unemployment, and isolation of Hunters Point.
Hunters Point was a food desert and housing in the Hunters Point area, especially the temporary housing erected during World War II to house shipyard workers, was dilapidated. Ruth Williams and Justin Herman called the area "worn-out" and "blighted". They described the "run-down housing with leaking roofs, sagging foundations, rotting plumbing, rodents and vermin" and concluded "no reasonable person believes that such housing should be continued in San Francisco any longer than is absolutely necessary". The surrounding area, also known as "the ridge", was also called "devoid of amenities" for the lack of grocery stores, poor schools, and limited recreation facilities. State law required these temporary buildings be razed by 1970, and to ensure replacement housing could be built, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency sent a letter to the City Controller recommending the area be declared a redevelopment area. On July 30, 1962, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors appropriated to apply for a federal grant. The two projects that had just gotten started in 1966 to alleviate the blight were known as the Butchertown and Hunters Point Redevelopment Projects.
In March 1966, residents from Bayview/Hunters Point picketed a meeting of the San Francisco Housing Authority to protest eviction policies. A Housing Authority official stated "the problem is one of jobs." Federal funds for job programs were cut in September 1966, triggering an impromptu meeting between the youth of Hunters Point, city officials, and community leaders. Mayor John Shelley sent a representative, who was threatened with physical harm if he returned with more empty promises; the Chamber of Commerce and major unions simply did not even show up to the meeting. Because funds for comparable programs in Los Angeles and Oakland had not been cut, the crowd quickly concluded the threat of rioting was effective in preserving those funds. At the time, it was estimated the national unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, but it was 5 percent in San Francisco, and African-American males in the San Francisco Bay Area were estimated to be unemployed at triple the rate of their Caucasian counterparts.
Shooting of Matthew Johnson.
On the afternoon of Tuesday, September 27, 1966, SFPD patrolman Alvin Johnson shot and killed Matthew 'Peanut' Johnson (no relation). That day was unusually warm in San Francisco, reaching a daytime high of ; the average of was 11° warmer than the 30-year historical average of .
At 2:30 P.M. local time, Officer Johnson drove near a suspicious 1958 Buick, stopped facing northward at the intersection of Griffith and Oakdale; as he pulled up to the car, two of the three occupants, Matthew 'Peanut' Johnson (16 years old) and Clifton Bacon (15) left the car and fled east into the field near the temporary World War II shipyard worker housing. The third occupant, Darnell Mobley (14) hid near parked cars and was not seen by Officer Johnson.  Officer Johnson immediately suspected the boys had stolen the car because they had fled upon his approach,  although the car was not reported stolen until hours after the encounter, at 8:25 P.M. that night. According to the owner of the automobile, she had parked the car near Portola Junior High, from where it had been stolen at 11:36 A.M.; Bacon recalled hearing the fourth period lunch bell. The owner did not report the car as stolen until later that night because she had believed her husband had come for the car.
Officer Johnson briefly pursued Bacon and Matthew Johnson on foot, but they outran him and he observed them headed north toward Navy Road and Griffith Street. Officer Johnson returned to his car to chase them, warning them to stop or he would shoot.  As he approached Building 15 at the corner of Navy and Griffith, Officer Johnson saw Matthew run out from behind the building and again Officer Johnson yelled at him to stop. Officer Johnson proceeded to drive his patrol car to the east end of Building 15, then exited the car to see Matthew running south, down the hill. According to a televised interview later that night, Officer Johnson again commanded Matthew to stop before he fired three warning shots into the air. Johnson then fired a fourth shot at Matthew. Matthew was approximately away from the officer at the time of the fourth shot, running up a slight rise in the terrain, and Officer Johnson watched him pitch forward after the shot. Officer Johnson then ran to the scene, expecting to find the teenager paralyzed by fear. Instead, he found Matthew face-down with blood coming from his mouth. As he recounted in his interview, an apparently shaken Johnson asked a passing nurse to help Matthew before leaving the scene; he then ended the interview and was subsequently suspended without pay.
A witness would later contradict Officer Johnson's statement, saying that all shots fired were aimed at Matthew and the interview was carefully scripted to engender maximum sympathy for the police. Recalling the scene fifty years later, Oscar James said "[Officer Johnson] was lying his ass off. And then he walks away like he's getting ready to cry. He wasn't shaken up. It was a normal thing back then." Matthew was shot in the back. A coroner's jury would rule less than a month later on October 20, 1966 that Officer Johnson had committed justifiable homicide. Johnson was immediately restored to the force and his back pay during his suspension was reinstated. Matthew Johnson's family was represented during the inquest by lawyer Johnnie Cochran.
The first bystanders arrived at the scene from their nearby workplace at 185/187 Navy Road; Gus Davis had heard Officer Johnson calling for help, and Louise Williams, who was the responding nurse, had observed Matthew pitch forward from her office and ran to the scene to assist. Mrs. Williams rendered first aid until she could no longer detect a pulse. The San Francisco Police Department was informed of the shooting at 3:10 P.M., and an ambulance from the Alemany Emergency Hospital responded by 3:14 P.M. A paramedic from the ambulance pronounced Matthew dead shortly after arrival, and the Coroner's office was called at 3:28 P.M. Matthew's body was removed at 3:50 P.M., and the automobile that sparked the shooting was towed to the impound yard at 3:55 P.M.
Growing unrest.
By 4:00 P.M., there were approximately 150 bystanders observing the proceedings, although they dispersed on their own at approximately 4:15. Later that afternoon, a group of approximately 40–60 young adults were observed at the Economic Opportunity Center (headquarters of the local Office of Economic Opportunity, at Third and Palou) loudly discussing plans to storm the Potrero Police Station (then located at Third and 20th), and Captain Harry Nelson, the commanding officer at Potrero, was called to meet with them and address their concerns. After listening to their questions, Nelson stated the shooting was under investigation and no results were yet available, leaving the group at approximately 6:45 P.M.
The youths who had met with Nelson spilled out into the streets, smashing displays at the nearby Rexall Drug store and moving north along Third. A riot was declared in progress at 7:35 P.M. Mayor John F. Shelley traveled to Potrero Station to meet with Police Chief Thomas J. Cahill and Supervisor Terry Francois, and they then drove to the Bayview Community Center (an annex built on the South San Francisco Opera House at Third and Newcomb) to address the crowd and plead for peace. A thrown rock narrowly missed Mayor Shelley, and a motorcycle officer was struck in the face with a brick as they arrived at the Community Center. After entering the Community Center, Mayor Shelley informed the crowd that Officer Johnson had been suspended from duty, and the trio returned to Potrero Station at 9:30 P.M.  Supervisor Francois, the lone African-American member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, had received an especially hostile reaction. Outside the Community Center, he was shouted down when he tried to speak, and also had rocks thrown at him by the angry crowd.
Meanwhile, riot units had been assembled at Potrero Station and were taken to staging areas along Quint to sweep east and disperse crowds towards Third, and other patrols were set up to move car traffic out of the area by blocking Third and redirecting automobiles from Williams to Evans. After the sweep was complete, the riot units reassembled at Third and Oakdale to push the crowds further east. As noted later by Arthur Hippler, the "sweep" followed the contemporary standard practice of the SFPD, which was to herd African-American youths away from the remainder of San Francisco and isolate them in Hunters Point. Wary of further unrest, Chief Cahill ordered additional police officers to report for duty, and the California Army National Guard and CHP were alerted that their assistance may be needed.
Curfew imposed.
By 11 P.M. the night of September 27, the first reports of smashed windows, looting, and rioting were starting to arrive from SFPD's Northern District, covering the Fillmore District. When the first Highway Patrol officers began to arrive, they were dispatched to assist SFPD in both the Fillmore and Hunters Point areas. Chief Cahill shortly thereafter asked Mayor Shelley to request the assistance of the National Guard, and Mayor Shelley called Governor Brown at 11:39 P.M., asking for 2,000 National Guardsmen. Governor Brown mobilized the requested number at 11:44 P.M. and officially declared a state of emergency. Under the emergency proclamation, a curfew was imposed starting at midnight, to last until 6 A.M. on September 28. It was the largest police mobilization in San Francisco since the end of World War II.
The curfew was drawn around neighborhoods in the Fillmore and Hunters Point districts. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) later called the boundaries "gerrymandered around all areas with a large Negro population", pointing out that one neighborhood surrounding St. Francis Square was excluded from the curfew area generally imposed on the Fillmore because it was "a mostly white middleclass housing project."
Adjutant General Roderic L. Hill of the California National Guard arrived at SFPD headquarters at 1:15 A.M., and Candlestick Park and Kezar Stadium were selected as the staging areas for the National Guard soldiers being mobilized. By 7 A.M. on Wednesday, September 28, control had returned to Potrero Station and the situation was calm until calls began at 9:30 A.M. reporting that crowds were gathering near the Bayview Community Center.
Shooting the Community Center.
SFPD leadership met with community leaders and agreed to let those leaders attempt to broker peace with the restless crowds. However, Hippler points out the leaders had nothing concrete to offer the angry youths: "... "There was nothing that they were empowered to offer the "rioters" to induce them to stop "rioting" that was even half as rewarding as the "rioting" itself." The feelings of manhood and power — especially the power to reverse the roles of underdog and top dog relative to the police, who stand for the white community — could not be compensated for by vague promises." By 11 A.M., the crowd outside the Bayview Community Center was up to nearly 200 people, and the unusually hot day (already and rising to a record high of )  was further inflamed by the crowd throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails. The crowd at the Community Center rapidly grew to nearly 700 strong as unrest broke out across the city. Riots were reported at Mission High School at noon; another riot was reported at Horace Mann Junior High at 1:18 P.M.; and youths were reported throwing rocks and blocking traffic in the Fillmore. The curfew was reimposed on the Fillmore at 12:07 P.M. On Wednesday, there were 1,200 National Guard troops on patrol with police officers, 1,300 more troops standing by, and 2,000 troops in suburban areas. Troops, many of whom had been mobilized to quell the Watts riots of 1965, were issued orders to use lethal force: their commander, Lt. Col. Harland Smith, instructed troops "If you are attacked or fired upon, shoot to kill. Don't fire over anybody's head."
Firefighters, staged to protect properties and businesses, came under attack and National Guard units were dispatched to protect them at 4 P.M. At least one contemporary news report filed by the Associated Press stated that sniping (at law enforcement) was "sporadic and 'almost continuous'". At around the same time, reports of looting, thrown rocks, and gunfire were being heard in the vicinity of Third, and before the police stormed the area, community leaders were again given a short time to convince the crowd to voluntarily disperse. The leaders' efforts were unsuccessful, and at 5:43 P.M., a SFPD officer, Jerry Green, was reported as having been injured (the Associated Press reported he was wounded by a sniper). He was subsequently rushed to the hospital.
Accounts diverge at this point. According to the official "128 Hours" report, the officer was "injured by thrown debris", and other personnel near the Bayview Community Center subsequently came under attack, with gunfire and firebombs directed towards them from the Community Center. The police responded by firing two volleys into the air as a warning, but after once again coming under attack, the police shot at the Community Center to suppress resistance. After the gunfire had quelled and officers entered the Community Center, the only evidence that gunfire was directed at the police was in a jacket found behind the right front wheel of a car parked near the Community Center; the jacket had 60 seconal capsules and a single expended .22 cartridge. The Associated Press reported the shooting was in response to a sniper who had taken shelter behind the car, and that sniper had been arrested following the incident.
According to the SNCC, the incident was touched off by a policeman who, after being struck by a rock, exclaimed "I'm hit, I'm hit." His partner radioed the injury into headquarters without explaining what "hit" meant, and assuming that a police officer had been shot, the police responded in force, pouring bullets into the Community Center for seven or eight minutes. At the time, there were 200 children inside the Community Center, and adults inside directed the children to lie down to avoid the bullets. Seven adults outside the Community Center were wounded by the bullets, including Adam Rogers, a member of the community group Youth for Service, which had formed a Peace Patrol group to try to clear the area of protesters at the time. "128 Hours" agrees that seven were injured by gunfire, but qualified their injuries by noting "none of which were above the waistline of those persons injured and none of which were of a critical nature." Another news report echoed the minimal injuries, stating three were injured in the legs by shotgun pellets, and almost one dozen had minor cuts.
After the shooting at the Bayview Community Center, National Guard troops staged at Candlestick were deployed to the area, marching north along Third, extending two blocks east and west. Troops were equipped with fixed bayonets and completed the clean-up at 7:15 P.M.; the area remained quiet for the remainder of Wednesday night into Thursday morning. A rumor that rioters may attack businesses along Market Street sent a combined force of SFPD/CHP officers to patrol that area, but no violence was recorded in the area. Meanwhile, in the Fillmore, minor violence had been mostly suppressed by 9 P.M., with sporadic reports of window smashing and looting continuing until 3 A.M. An unidentified Guardsman also stated that Wednesday night was "very uneventful" and the 8 P.M. curfew had been effective in keeping rioters off the streets.
Diminishing violence.
The curfew remained in effect until 6 A.M. on Thursday, September 29, but Highway Patrol and National Guard units were beginning to withdraw from San Francisco after Governor Brown held a press conference at 9:25 P.M. Violence throughout the daytime hours of Thursday was limited mainly to schools; inter-school athletic events were suspended and Washington High School was dismissed early. Trouble apparently followed the students returning home, as additional violence was reported in Haight-Ashbury, where a bus driver was assaulted.
A Youth Peace Patrol (YPP) was created "under the direction and guidance of the Police Department" to replace the prior Youth for Service patrol. "128 Hours" drily noted "the effectiveness of the Youth for Service street monitors was not as effective as had been anticipated." YPP wore SFPD-issued armbands to identify YPP members, and worked their first shift Thursday night after meeting with Chief Cahill to establish rules. Cahill expressed optimism after that meeting. That night, after the curfew went into effect at 8 P.M., no major incidents occurred apart from the arrest of 85 protesters in Haight-Ashbury. The SNCC noted the curfew in Haight-Ashbury was not well-publicized and that police appeared to be targeting exclusively "Negroes, students and hippies" for arrest. The curfew on Friday and Saturday nights (relaxed to start at 11 P.M., lasting until 6 A.M. each night, as announced during a press conference held by Mayor Shelley on September 30, 1966) passed without further major incidents, and the state of emergency was declared over at 11 P.M. on Sunday, October 2.
Mayor Shelley declared his suspicions during that same press conference on September 30 that "outside agitators" had been fomenting the riots, stating his contacts amongst the Hunters Point youth leaders had identified 17 young men who had entered the area from southern California and the East Bay.
Aftermath.
During the 128 hours that followed the killing of Matthew Johnson, 359 were arrested (many for curfew violations) and 51 were injured, including 6 police officers, 2 firefighters, and 1 municipal bus driver. No additional people were killed, and property damage was estimated at less than $100,000. According to the official report "128 Hours", 457 were arrested and 160 were injured (58 police officers, 27 firefighters, 5 other city employees, and 2 from CHP; 69 civilians, of whom 10 reported gunshot wounds). That report's detailed assessment of damages counted in property damage and in inventory losses.
A program to hire the unemployed drew immediate praise from Dick Gregory days after the state of emergency was over. Cyril Magnin, head of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, announced plans to hire "2,000 colored youths", modeling the plan on the recommendations made after the Watts riots. Rep. Phillip Burton announced plans to hire 1,000 temporary workers at the post office for the holiday season, and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare announced plans to start a request for 10,000 health aides. However, by June 1967, only 19 of the promised 2,000 jobs had been posted to the Youth Opportunity Center. In November 1968, a survey of households in Hunters Point indicated the unemployment rate persisted at approximately 15% of 16,000 eligible workers; 80% of those eligible workers were African-American.
Prior to the uprising, San Francisco had begun in 1965 to plan the redevelopment of in the Butchertown meatpacking district adjacent to the Hunters Point projects. After the riots, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Hunters Point community leaders, and the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency applied for funds to identify potential business and employment opportunities. The Butchertown Redevelopment Project (subsequently renamed the India Basin Redevelopment Project) was approved in 1969.
"Life" magazine noted the riot became an issue during the 1966 gubernatorial race between Pat Brown and Ronald Reagan. Reagan accused Brown has not learned "from the experience of Watts and has done nothing to forestall future disturbances in possible trouble spots." Brown retorted the issue "is far too serious to engage in a quarrel with that actor", disparaging Reagan's professional qualifications. "Life" defended Brown's actions and closed the article with a quip from Brown's mother, who he recounted had instructed him to declare "the shooting of that Negro boy was absolutely inexcusable", which he declined.
The Kerner Commission released its report on February 29, 1968 detailing the causes for the race riots of 1967, many of which echoed the underlying reasons for the Hunters Point social uprising:
In June 1968, Edward S. Montgomery, an investigative reporter for the "San Francisco Examiner", testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that "agitational activities were conducted prior to the riots" by several organizations, which he named as the Direct Action Group, the Ad Hoc Committee To End Discrimination, the Progressive Labor Party, the W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America, the Communist Party USA, and the Anarchist League.
Johnson, Johnson, and Johnson.
President Lyndon Johnson assigned Joseph A. Califano, W. Willard Wirtz, and Sargent Shriver to work on sending federal funds to address what Mayor Shelley called "the critical unemployment situation" among African-Americans in San Francisco.
1,000 mourners attended the funeral of Matthew 'Peanut' Johnson at Evergreen Baptist Church on Monday, October 3.
Patrolman Alvin Johnson retired on March 2, 1971, with 27 years of combined service with SFPD and the City Prison.
Legacy.
The Hunters Point Social Uprising was one of the subjects covered in "Our Part of Town", a 1994 production at the Bayview Opera House based on oral histories compiled by Heidi Hardin.

István Levente Garai

István Levente Garai (15 June 1955 – 25 December 2018) was a Hungarian physician and politician, member of the National Assembly (MP) for Kiskunfélegyháza (Bács-Kiskun County Constituency V) from 1994 to 1998 and from 2006 to 2010. He was also a Member of Parliament from the Bács-Kiskun County regional list of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) from 2004 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2014.
Biography.
Garai was born in Berettyóújfalu on 15 June 1955, as the son of teacher István Garai Sr. and health visitor Erzsébet Szabó. He finished his elementary studies in Szank and secondary studies in Kiskunfélegyháza, where graduated at the Móra Ferenc Secondary School in 1973. He earned his degree of general practitioner at the Medical University of Szeged (today a faculty of the University of Szeged, SZTE) in 1979. He started his professional career in the local hospital of Kiskunfélegyháza. He made a special examination of internal medicine in 1985.
He was elected to the local council of Kiskunfélegyháza in 1985, serving in this capacity until 1990. He chaired its health and social committee. He joined the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP) in 1988. After Mihály Korom resigned from his parliamentary seat (Bács-Kiskun County Constituency VIII) under social pressure on 30 May 1989, Garai was nominated the ruling communist party's candidate for the position. He won the two by-elections held throughout in 1989, but turnout was too low to make the ballots valid in both cases. Garai was a founder of the local organization Democratic Youth Federation of Kiskunfélegyháza (Fédisz), which initially was established as an autonomous regional branch of the Hungarian Democratic Youth League (DEMISZ) in Kiskunfélegyháza, the short-lived successor organization of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ). Its first congress elected Garai as leader of the organization. Meanwhile, he also joined the newly established Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in October 1989, the legal successor of the MSZMP. The Fédisz transformed itself as a party to the 1990 parliamentary election. They made an electoral coalition with the local Regional Democratic Youth Alliance (Tedisz) from Kiskunmajsa, the two parties had only one individual candidate, István Levente Garai, who ran in the Kiskunfélegyháza constituency and came to the fourth place. During the 1990 municipal election, he was elected to the local representative body of Kiskunfélegyháza as the list leader of Fédisz, where he chaired the health, social and family protection committee, and was also a member of the culture, education and youth committee.
Garai participated in the 1994 parliamentary election as a candidate of the Socialist Party and secured an individual mandate, representing his hometown Kiskunfélegyháza. He sat in the Social and Health Committee until the 1998 parliamentary election, when he lost his parliamentary seat against Fidesz candidate Sándor Endre. Garai was again defeated by Endre in the 2002 parliamentary election, while MSZP became the governing force. However, Garai secured a mandate two years later from his party's Bács-Kiskun County regional list on 27 August 2004, when replaced Csaba Tabajdi, who was elected to the European Parliament. He worked for the Social and Family Committee until 2006 and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for a brief time. He was a member of the Health Committee from 2004 to 2014. Meanwhile, Garai served as deputy mayor of Kiskunfélegyháza between 2002 and 2010, and was considered a strong local ally of mayor József Ficsór (SZDSZ). During the 2006 parliamentary election, Garai defeated Endre after two unsuccessful attempts and became MP for Kiskunfélegyháza again after eight years. In the 2010 parliamentary election, he lost to Krisztián Kapus (Fidesz). He became a Member of Parliament through the Socialists' Bács-Kiskun County regional list. Garai was nominated to the MSZP's candidate for the mayoral position of Kiskunfélegyháza in the 2010 local elections, after Ficsór retired from politics, but he was again defeated by Kapus. Garai functioned as MP until the 2014 parliamentary election, when he ran as a joint candidate of the Unity parties in Kiskunfélegyháza (Bács-Kiskun County Constituency IV), but came only to the third place after Sándor Lezsák (Fidesz) and László Kollár (Jobbik).

Ekkeland Götze

Ekkeland Götze (born August 14, 1948) is a German painter, printmaker and conceptual artist.
Life.
Götze was born in Dresden on August 14, 1948. After a training as a screen printer he educated himself as an industrial engineer through a correspondence course. He was not allowed to study painting since he was lacking the "Abitur" educational achievement, but Gerhard Kettner, president of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, provided him with a teaching assignment for screen printing anyway. Götze painted in his spare time, but he was not allowed to exhibit because of regulations in East Germany - formally he was a printmaker, not a painter. Because of these restrictions he filed an application for an exit permit 1985 which was granted in 1988. He immediately moved from Dresden to Munich, West Germany, where he opened up a printshop for artists. He is also co-owner of a garment company.
Works.
In 1989 Götze started to work on a project called "Erde" ("Earth"). He collects soil samples at extraordinary sites of human history around the world and applies them to paper, lime mortar or other backgrounds, making use of a standardized, self-developed technique he calls "terragraphy": He grinds the soil, mixes it with a binder and then applies it making use of a technique similar to screen printing. All backgrounds are square and of identical size. For each site the resulting works of art are given an individual name that reflects the importance of the site. According to Götze, the pictures capture th "spirit and energy" of the place where the soil was gathered. German theatre researcher Christopher Balme described Götzes role during the emergence of his works as that of a "medium in a shamanistic sense". During the course of the project, Götze visited various European and North American countries as well as e.g. Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Madagascar, New Zealand, South Africa, Tibet and Venezuela. In addition to the prints Götzes uses photos of the sites to contextualize the prints. Between 1990 and 2001, Götze compiled and published 13 artist's books depicting the "Erde" works, one site per book. For the book about New Zealand he cooperated with local artist Christina Wirihana. In 2014 he designed an album cover for German jazz trio Kolb Schindler Schubert.
Götze runs a studio in Sendling. He is a member of the Neue Gruppe, an association of Munich artists regularly exhibiting at the Haus der Kunst museum. In 2018 Götze has been awarded the "Seerosenpreis", a yearly award assigned to visual artists by the city of Munich.

Battle of Haglebu

The Battle of Haglebu on 26 April 1945 was a skirmish towards the end of the German occupation of Norway in the Second World War. A patrol of German and Norwegian police troops had been tipped off that weapons were hidden in Haglebu and came up from Eggedal on a search. On the southern shore of Haglebuvannet, the German force divided to search both sides of the lake. On the western side, the Germans received machine-gun fire from the Norwegian resistance movement (Milorg) and soon came under attack on the eastern side as well. After about four hours, during which the Norwegians repulsed the German assaults, Milorg carried out an orderly withdrawal before German reinforcements arrived.
Albeit a small battle and local in nature, it had a large effect on the course of the war in Norway. The battle marked a defeat for Norwegians who collaborated with the Germans. This may have contributed to the collaborators' acceptance of the German surrender, which prevented further fighting between Milorg and the collaborators. The resistance allegedly committed a war crime by executing a prisoner; the Norwegian Waffen SS soldier Tom Henry Zakariassen (21) was shot after surrendering, allegedly by Lieutenant Peter Fredrik Holst, who was never prosecuted for the alleged war crime.

Brandon Marsh (baseball)

Brandon Chase Marsh (born December 18, 1997) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Amateur career.
Marsh graduated from Buford High School in Buford, Georgia. As a senior, he batted .559 with four home runs, 25 RBIs, 19 stolen bases and a 1.545 OPS. He committed to Kennesaw State University to play baseball. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the second round of the 2016 MLB draft and he signed with them for $1 million.
Professional career.
Marsh did not play in 2016 due to an asymptomatic lower-back injury that landed him on the 60-day disabled list. He made his professional debut in 2017 with the Orem Owlz and spent the whole season there, batting .350 with four home runs, 44 RBIs, ten stolen bases and a .944 OPS in 39 games.

1920 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1920 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 2, 1920, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background and vote.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
Nonetheless, the largely white but secessionist “upcountry” regions of the state – lying immediately south of the few substantially unionist counties – had seen strong opposition to the policies of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson since World War I broke out. Wilson had attempted to purge anti-war Southern Democrats in the 1918 midterm elections, and with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment and his League of Nations proposal further hostility to him emerged in the Peach State.
All these factors meant Cox lost significantly in the upcountry areas of the state where Harding carried many areas that had supported Populist Thomas E. Watson or Progressives in recent elections. Elsewhere, however, partisan loyalties remained extremely strong, so that Harding’s gain was less than most other Southern states and Georgia surpassed Louisiana – where a major anti-Wilson revolt was occurring at the polls in Acadiana – as the third-most Democratic state behind Mississippi and South Carolina.

Trent Frazier

Trent Frazier (born September 8, 1998) is an American college basketball player for the Illinois Fighting Illini of the Big Ten Conference.
High school career.
As a sophomore, Frazier led Wellington High School to an 8A Florida High School Athletic Association basketball state championship, and hit the game-winning free throw with 0.4 seconds left for a 57–56 victory over Hagerty High School. Frazier played under legendary hoops coach and 8A coach of the year, Matt Colin.
During his senior season, Frazier averaged 27.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.4 assists, leading Wellington to a 27–4 record and Florida Class 9A State Semifinals appearance.
Recruiting.
After his official visit to Illinois, Frazier verbally committed to the program and former head coach John Groce on August 21, 2016. During his recruitment, Frazier considered offers from Baylor, Maryland, Kansas State, and Seton Hall.
In March 2017 Frazier reaffirmed his decision to play college basketball at Illinois after John Groce was fired and head coach Brad Underwood was hired away from Oklahoma State. Frazier had indicated that both his connections to his future teammates at Illinois and that Underwood had recruited Frazier while he was head coach at Stephen F. Austin were factors in the decision to remain committed to Illinois.
College career.
On February 8, 2018, Frazier scored a career high 32 points against Wisconsin at the State Farm Center. Frazier's 32 points were the third most points ever scored by a freshman in a single game in Illinois history, trailing only Deon Thomas and Kiwane Garris who are the first and second all-time leading scorers at Illinois. He also scored 27 points against Iowa, including a buzzer beating three to send the game into overtime. During his freshman season, Frazier led all Big Ten Conference freshman in scoring, assists, steals and three-pointers made per game, earning both conference All-Freshman team honors and Honorable Mention honors. Frazier averaged 12.5 points, 3.1 assists and 1.8 rebounds per game as a true freshman. As a sophomore, he averaged 13.7 points, 2.6 assists and 2.3 rebounds per game. Frazier served in a complementary role to Ayo Dosunmu as a junior, averaging 9.1 points and 1.9 assists per game.

Sheena Cruickshank

Sheena Margaret Cruickshank is a British immunologist and Professor in Biomedical Sciences and Public Engagement at the University of Manchester. She researches how immune responses of the gut are started as a result of infection and/or inflammation. Cruickshank is a science communicator.
Education.
Cruickshank completed a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry &amp; Immunology at Strathclyde University. She earned a PhD in immunology in 1998 from the University of Leeds for research investigating the effects of pleiotropic cytokines on liver cells.
Research and career.
Since 2007 Cruickshank has worked in the Department of Immunology at the University of Manchester. She uses "in vitro" and "in vivo" approaches to characterise crosstalk between immune cells, commensal bacteria, pathogens and epithelial cells. These experiments make use of infectious models, including "Toxoplasma gondii" and "Trichuris muris", to understand immunity regulation in the skin and gut. By identifying how the skin and gut recognise and respond to the microbiome, they are starting to understand how it affects cell function. Cruickshank won the Northwest BioNow award for her test for the management and assessment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
BBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2018 in the series "The Life Scientific" Sheena Cruickshank's reflections on her life and career. Her brother was passionate about science and particularly marine biology which inspired her to have an interest in science from an early age. His subsequent illness with cancer and death at a young age was a series of events that helped shape her curiosity about the immune system and why diseases happen.
Public engagement.
In 2009, Cruickshank co-created the "Worm Wagon", "an interactive program that merges art and science activities to promote awareness of parasitic worm infection". She later created the "Wiggling Rangoli", exploring parasites and how parasitic infections impacts people around the world. Cruickshank created the citizen science app "Britain Breathing", which teaches the impacts of air pollution. The app maps the incidence of allergies and asthma, and uses data to explore why allergies are increasing and the role of air pollution in allergy development. She is a trustee of and the Public Engagement Secretary for the British Society for Immunology. She has appeared on the BBC and CNN. Cruickshank is interested in ways to empower migrant communities with science using English classes.
She acts as academic lead for public engagement at the University of Manchester where she has developed their public engagement strategy and is working to enhance public engagement support and development at the University of Manchester. She blogs about the University of Manchester public engagement.
Awards and honours.
In 2013 she won Royal Society of Biology Communicator of the Year and the Manchester International Women’s Day Award in Women &amp; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. She was a finalist in the 2014 NCCPE Engage and 2016 Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Innovator competitions. In 2014 she spoke at QEDcon, a two day skepticism and pop-science conference. In 2016 she introduced Manchester's Science in the City festival. She was a keynote speaker at the 2017 Bluedot Festival. She spoke at "New Scientist" Live 2017. Cruickshank was a 2017 "Cosmic Superhero", a photographic exhibition at Conway Hall Ethical Society. She spoke about the microbiome at TEDx Manchester in Bridgewater Hall, her talk was called "Eat Yourself Healthy".
She won the 2017 "Better World" and "Making a Difference Award for Social Responsibility" Award. She is a 2017-18 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellow.

George Goelet Kip (January 15, 1845 – June 27, 1926) was a New York lawyer, heir and member of the Goelet family during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Kip was born on January 15, 1845, in New York City. He was the son of Elbert Samuel Kip (1799–1876) and Elizabeth (née Goelet) Kip (1808–1882). Growing up, Kip lived with his parents, his sister Margaret (who died young), and the family's servants in a house overlooking Washington Square in Manhattan. Both of his parents inherited a substantial amount of property and never worked during their lifetimes.
On his father's side Kip was a descendant of Jessé de Forest and Hendrick Hendricksen Kip, founder of the Kip family of Kips Bay, Manhattan. During the American Revolution, his great-grandparents Samuel Kip and Anna Herring owned the famous Kips Bay Mansion, the oldest house in Manhattan until it was taken down in 1851. On his mother's side, Kip was a great-grandson of Peter Goelet, a wealthy New York merchant and progenitor of the Goelet family real estate fortune.
Kip attended Columbia University as an undergraduate, graduating in 1865. While at Columbia, Kip served as the President of the Peithologian Society, a student debating society. He received his LLM from Columbia in 1867.
Career.
Kip was a partner in the law firm DeWitt, Lockman and Kip, based at 88 Nassau Street, for a number of years, along with George Gosman DeWitt and John Thomas Lockman. In 1882 he represented his cousins Robert Goelet and Ogden Goelet (builder of Ochre Court and father of Mary Goelet) before the New York Supreme Court in a legal battle that erupted over control of trusts set up by Peter P. Goelet and Jean B. Goelet for their nephews. Kip's firm was known for its work defending the estates of New York's old Dutch families.
In the 1880s, Kip moved his family and servants to Ruremont, an 11-acre country estate on Madison Avenue in Morristown, New Jersey, a street then known as "Millionaires Row." In 1902, the Town and Country Life magazine wrote that Ruremont, “with its smooth lawns and well-ordered gardens and greenhouses,” was “one of the most attractive places in Morristown.”
Kip was a member of the exclusive Holland Society of New York, the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, the University Club of New York and The Metropolitan Club. He also maintained an extensive correspondence with preservationist John Muir, of whom he was a friend and financial supporter.
Personal life.
On May 23, 1867, Kip was married to Anna Margaret Geissenhainer (1847–1893) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania by the Rev. George W. Schumucker. Anna was the daughter of the Rev. Augustus T. Geissenhainer and Amelia (née Havemeyer) Geissenhainer. She was also the niece of three-term New York City mayor William Frederick Havemeyer. Her mother and uncle were children of William Havemeyer, founder of the sugar refining company that would become the Sugar Trust (later Domino Sugar). Through her father, Anna was also a second cousin of the New Jersey congressman Jacob Augustus Geissenhainer. Together, George and Anna were the parents of three children:
His wife died suddenly of heart failure on April 5, 1893, and in 1898 Kip funded the construction of the Anna Margaret Home for Convalescents, the main building of the new Morristown Memorial Hospital, in her honor. Kip died at his home in Morristown on June 27, 1926.

1908 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1908 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 3, 1908, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
However, politics after the first demobilization by a cumulative poll tax was chaotic. Third-party movements, chiefly the Populist Party, gained support amongst poor whites and the remaining black voters in opposition to the planter elite. The fact that Georgia had already substantially reduced its poor white and black electorate two decades ago, alongside pressure from urban elites in Atlanta, meant the Populist movement substantially faded in the late 1890s. Nevertheless, this did not prevent demands for more complete disenfranchisement after the state’s politics again turned chaotic as former Vice-Presidential candidate Thomas E. Watson attempted to revive the Populist Party in 1904, whilst Hoke Smith ran for Governor as a radical reformist in 1906.
The aim of co-opting the Populists led Georgia to become the last former Confederate state to initiate a full-scale disenfranchisement plan to largely eliminate the seventy thousand or so blacks who remained on the rolls. The process, involving a literacy test and a grandfather clause in addition to the poll tax, alongside statewide white primaries, was achieved in the next presidential election year, when a transformed Watson ran for the Populist Party on a white supremacist campaign. At the same time the Republican Party aimed to make gains in the South because of opposition by developing manufacturers to William Jennings Bryan’s populism, and by nominee William Howard Taft’s willingness to accept black disfranchisement.
Vote.
At the beginning of September, Taft spoke of carrying Georgia and other southern states, though this idea was dismissed by Democratic committee members. Polls, when taken in October, always suggested Bryan would win the state, though by a smaller margin than usual. This was indeed the observed result, although anti-populist sentiment resulted in the GOP carrying twelve secessionist upcountry counties that had never gone Republican before. Watson fell substantially from his 1904 performance, and would disband the Populist Party after the election.

The fact that Georgia had already substantially reduced its poor white and black electorate two decades ago, alongside pressure from urban elites in Atlanta, and the decline of isolationism due to the success of the Spanish–American War, meant the Populist movement substantially faded in the late 1890s. However, Populism would revive in 1904 when it became clear a conservative would be nominated by the Democratic Party, whilst Watson did not find it difficult to get a somewhat demoralized party’s nomination over William V. Allen.
Vote.
Watson would campaign in the state in August, but as Georgia had not voted Republican even during Reconstruction neither major party candidate visited the state. Watson would collapse from his campaigning at the end of September, No polls were taken until October 29, by which time the state was naturally viewed as certain for Parker. Parker would eventually win Georgia with over five-eighths of the vote, although he declined by about three percent from William Jennings Bryan’s performance four years previously. Incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt and Watson ran a very close race for second, with the President edging the Populist for this position.

Terre del Barolo

Terre del Barolo is a cooperative winery based in Castiglione Falletto, in the Langhe area of northern Italy, renowned for the production of the main Piedmontese wines. Founded in 1958, Cantina Terre del Barolo is one of the most historic cooperative wineries still active in Piedmont.
History.
Genesis of the project.
The territory of Langhe has always been a land of renowned wines, however the first decades of the twentieth century were characterized by difficult periods: the two world wars, the phylloxera epidemic and periods of economic depression due also to a market of grapes characterized by more and more strong speculations to the detriment of winemakers.
The idea of founding a cooperative winery in Castiglione Falletto is due to the intuition of Arnaldo Rivera, son of winegrowers in the area. Already his father founded a cooperative winery in the twenties but didn’t have the hoped success, anyway Arnaldo Rivera had the mind to repeat the company. Before even developing the project to involve local winegrowers, as a primary school teacher of the country as it was, he proposed almost like a game to their students to set up a sort of cooperative of the hens with the purpose of financing the year-end school tour with the sale of the eggs. This didactic experiment, so-called “the hens' cooperative”, carried out as a capital for each student, was successful and at the end of the school year, its dissolution was unanimously approved with the consequent sale of all the hens. 
In the 1958 Rivera he succeeded in overcoming the widespread distrust of cooperative associations since in the first half of the twentieth-century various wine consortia had also failed due to a lack of dynamic market. While continuing his activities as an elementary teacher and mayor of Castiglione Falletto, the project of a new wine cooperative involved him in the development of local resources and helped to safeguard the interests of the wine sector in the area, avoiding further speculation. Rivera was able to convince many winegrowing friends in difficulty but also mayors of other municipalities and then public bodies and banks to obtain the necessary funding.
The foundation of Cantina Terre del Barolo.
On December 8, 1958, with a deed of incorporation drafted in the hall of the Town Hall of Grinzane Cavour in front of the notary Italo Ferrero, Cantina Terre del Barolo was founded with headquarters in Castiglione Falletto and the founding members at the time of foundation, represented by President Arnaldo Rivera, were twenty-two. 
The works for the construction of the plant, designed by the engineer Biagio Soave and the architect Elio Celato, left after in 1959 on land partly purchased by the diocese and partly by the peasants and, in the meantime, the members of the association rose to over three hundred.
In January 1961 the first ordinary assembly met to approve the first balance sheet which amounted to Lire 187,915,461 with revenues of Lire 2,666,913.
Growth during the difficult seventies.
In 1968 the budget of Cantina Terre del Barolo exceeded one billion lire and the plant was expanded to accommodate new oak barrels but also new spaces for the grapes provision, whose sale by the winegrowers partners no longer represented a problem as in the past. Despite the economic crisis of the early seventies, the cooperative winery began to be known by participating in various trade fairs in Alba but also in Turin, Milan, Genoa, Parma, Verona and was also organized a first distribution network.
In 1970 the Terre del Barolo cooperative winery also received two Diplomas with a Gold Medal, following participation in the 2nd National Competition of Italian Wines held in Milan. 
In 1974 the Cantina Terre del Barolo reached almost five hundred members and, despite the less abundant vintages, production and sales were destined to rise.
The eighties.
At the beginning of the eighties, the cooperative winery received in New York the prestigious American award “Italian Barrel Wine” for a 1979 Nebbiolo d'Alba decreed as one of the best Italian wines. The number of members settled at 550, with a budget that was close to seven billion lire.
In 1983 the twenty-five year activity was celebrated and Arnaldo Rivera, in a speech during the ceremony said that «a social entity that acts democratically sharing the income in relation to the participation of members can be a winning idea, breaking down the prejudice that men are destined to be armed against each other in the name of individual privilege and egoism».
In December 1986 Arnaldo Rivera resigned and after his death in 1987, took over Francesco Conterno who held the office of president until 1990, taking care to complete the process of renewal already started with Rivera, that included also the purchase of new equipments, the creation of an internal analysis laboratory and the modernization of the offices.
The cooperative from the nineties to today.
Since 1990 Matteo Bosco became the new president of the cooperative and the members were reduced to about four hundred, although nevertheless achieving satisfying results about production and quality; important renovations and expansion of the cellar and refining rooms were also carried out.
The flood of the Tanaro in 1994 damaged many municipalities and territories in the area, so the cooperative deliberated the granting of financial contributions in support of the most affected members. 
Since 2001, the cooperative has decided to set up an annual award to be awarded only to women distinguishing themselves for success in their professional field and the first woman to be awarded was Carla Fracci. In the following years, the Terre del Barolo Award was awarded to Luciana Littizzetto, Margherita Hack, Micol Fontana, Elena Sofia Ricci, Dacia Maraini and Enza Sampò. 
Under the leadership of the new president Paolo Boffa the Cantina Terre del Barolo in 2017, on the eve of its sixtieth anniversary, has commemorated its founder by creating a special selection of Barolo DOCG called ARNALDORIVERA.
The wines.
The cooperative winery mainly produces red wines produced exclusively from the Langhe grapes, respecting the DOC and DOCG regulations, including an organic line. The main wines are classified as Barolo, Nebbiolo, Barbera, and Dolcetto, to which is added a small production from the native Pelaverga and Nascetta wines. An Alta Langa DOCG "Metodo Classico" sparkling wine, a Barolo Chinato and a Barolo Grappa complete the range.

Dyck Advisory Group

Dyck Advisory Group (or DAG) is a private military company based in Velddrif, South Africa.
History.
The firm was founded in 2012 by Lionel Dyck, an ex-military colonel who had served in the Rhodesian Security Forces and then the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. He fought as part of the Zimbawean intervention force that assisted the Mozambican government against RENAMO during the Mozambican Civil War. At the time, he forged good relations in the Mozambican governing party FRELIMO and with later Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Following the Mozambican Civil War, Dyck continued to be involved in Mozambique, participating in demining and anti-poaching operations.
The Dyck Advisory Group specializes in demining and anti-poaching services, and has customers around the world. From 2019, the firm became active in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, where they helped to fight a local Islamist insurgency. The company was hired by police chief Bernardino Rafael, and helped to train local policemen besides fighting the rebels. The Dyck Advisory Group's troops operate and charter out several "Bat Hawk" light aircraft, and have deployed 3 Aérospatiale Gazelles, 2 Eurocopter AS350 Écureuils, and 1 Aérospatiale Alouette III in Cabo Delgado.
In 2021, Amnesty International reported that during operations in Mozambique, the firm's operatives fired machine guns from helicopters and dropped hand grenades indiscriminately into crowds of people, as well as repeatedly firing at civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and homes.
In the Battle of Palma of March and April 2021, the company assisted the Mozambican military and police forces in combating the attacking insurgents. According to Dyck, his operatives engaged several of the terrorists as well as rescued wounded policemen and trapped civilians. The rescue conducted in part by the Dyck Advisory Group was accused of rescuing white contractors before local black civilians by Amnesty International.

1900 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1900 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 6, 1900, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen and many poor whites, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which were restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club. This restriction was originally done by local laws and from 1898 by statewide party laws.
However, politics after the first demobilization by a cumulative poll tax was chaotic. Third-party movements, chiefly the Populist Party, gained support amongst the remaining poor white and black voters in opposition to the planter elite. The fact that Georgia had already substantially reduced its poor white and black electorate two decades ago, alongside pressure from urban elites in Atlanta, and the decline of isolationism due to the success of the Spanish–American War, meant the Populist movement substantially faded in the late 1890s, especially after the dominant Democratic Party instituted a statewide requirement to use primaries rather than conventions.
Vote.
Neither candidate campaigned in the state, despite McKinley’s efforts to establish the GOP amongst white southerners during the preceding election. Polls just before election day gave Bryan a majority of between forty thousand and sixty thousand, and this proved accurate, for Bryan won by nearly forty-seven thousand votes or by thirty-eight percent. Bryan even won fifty-nine percent of the ballots in what was typically the state’s most Republican county – Fannin – possibly due to his opposition to imperialist adventures in the Pacific. He is alongside Samuel J. Tilden and Jimmy Carter one of only three post-Civil War candidates to win a majority in Fannin County.

Hendrik Meijer

Hendrik Meijer (1883–1964) was a Dutch-American businessman who founded the supercenter chain Meijer.
Early life.
Meijer was born on December 28, 1883 in Hengelo, Netherlands. In Hengelo, which had recently become industrialized following the Industrial Revolution, Meijer's father worked under harsh conditions at a Stork B.V. mill. Meijer would eventually begin to work at the mill himself in 1896 at the age of 12, with anarchist and socialist views being imposed on Meijer during this time. He then began distributing pamphlets and posters in support of such ideologies while also criticizing Dutch colonialism. Later, Meijer joined the Dutch military in order to avoid further factory work. 
After leaving the military, he met Gezina Mantel, the daughter of anarchist and socialist organizers. Meijer then immigrated into the United States beside his parents and sister in 1907, with Mantel writing him often to ensure that Meijer remained active with anarchism and the teachings of social anarchist Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis. Meijer first resided in Holland, Michigan and was irritated by the conservative community and Christian Reformed Church, immediately joining a socialist group upon arrival. The group, possibly called "Modern Sons of Marx", met on Sunday; the city and Christian Reformed Church strictly believed Sundays were for the Sabbath and rest, though the group countered this by holding socialist meetings on Sunday. 
Meijer would eventually leave Holland and work various jobs, including as a cloth salesman, chicken and dairy farming and working in a mill. In 1912, Mantel arrived in the United States and the two settled in Greenville, Michigan, with the couple marrying on November 11, 1912 to commemorate the date anarchists were executed following the Haymarket affair. This same year, Meijer opened a barber shop in Greenville.
Career.
In 1934, Meijer entered the grocery business during the Great Depression after a building he constructed beside his barbershop was never rented. At the time, he borrowed $338.76 to purchase goods for the unused space, believing that if they did not sell, his family could use them. With the help of his son Frederik, the two began to operate the grocery store.
As the founder and leader of his grocery chain, Meijer's leadership was at the forefront of the industry, instituting self-service shopping, the use of shopping carts and the use of conveyors on the check-out counter. Workers of Meijer unionized in 1951 and he began to share feelings of frustration with their organization. In 1962, Meijer and his son Frederik pioneered the superstore concept with the opening of Thrifty Acres in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
On May 31, 1964 Meijer died at the age of 80 and Frederik took his position to lead the supermarket chain. By the twenty-first century, the Meijer supermarket chain grew into one of the largest private companies and retail stores in the Untied States.
Personal life.
Meijer and his wife espoused anarchist and socialist views at a young age. The Meijer family were patriotic while in the United States, criticizing American policy when they saw appropriate. Throughout his life, Meijer held controversial political views that contrasted the American public; he criticized World War I, condemned the arrest of Eugene V. Debs, described Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as being two parts of the same thing and denounced the red-baiting McCarthyism of Joseph McCarthy during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s. Meijer's household also did not smoke, drink alcohol and advocated for the respect of all people regardless of race or social class. Meijer also did not affiliate with organized religion, instead focusing on the overall morality of affairs occurring during his lifetime. 
Such political beliefs were passed on to Meijer's son Frederik, with one teacher stating that Frederik defended anarchists in class, describing them as "peace-loving people who don't like unjust governments and who try to bring them down". His daughter Johanna Meijer would later leave her position at Meijer and work for civil rights and arms control groups. It is unknown if Meijer ever separated from his anarchist views.

Linusorb

Linusorbs are small biologically active cyclic peptides synthesized in flaxseed ("Linum usitatissimum") from two ribosome-derived precursors. The name is derived from Linum" usitatissimum" orbitide.
The molecules are very stable, not easily digested and stiff.
Nomenclature for Linusorb: [1–#-NαC],[#-Xaa,#-Xaa]-linusorb #.
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Nomenclature for Natural Products supports the use of taxonomic names for the development of compound trivial names, while UniProt utilizes standard organism names as well as organism mnemonics in the naming of proteins. Linusorb product name according to Shim et al. (2015).
"Linkage" [1–#-NαC] Occurs between amino acid 1 and amino acid “#” through the α-amino group that a N-C cyclization of the core peptide. The en dash (–) is used and placed in square brackets.
"Modifications" [#-Xaa,#-Xaa] The notation utilizes a prefix code of 3, 4 characters. Specifies the position and type of modified amino acids in the peptide. Each modified amino acid is identified by its position in the core peptide sequence using abbreviations found in UniProt and IUPAC. A comma separates multiple post-translational modifications.
"Taxonomic name abbreviation" -linus The first three letters of the genus name and first two letters of the species name are used to identify the origin of the orbitide. Based on the list of species maintained by UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist).
"Common suffix" (-orb) Short for orbitide.
Amino acid residue numbering (#) Residue numbering begins at the N-terminal-most amino acid residue of the orbitide, based on DNA sequence. Notation for any post-translational modifications start with the lowest number and proceed to the highest number. Where multiple identical modifications are present, they are grouped together as illustrated for Met groups in [1–8-NαC],[1,3-("R"s,"Ss")-MetO]-linusorb A1 (Table 1 and Figure 1; formerly cyclolinopeptide G, CLG). This more descriptive name for CLG reflects the complexity of fully and appropriately naming this compound as it contains the chiral amino acid methionine "S"-oxide. Clearly, what was formerly recognized as CLG is actually four distinct compounds. New full names for all “cyclolinopeptide” variants are suggested in Table 1. 
Table 1. Elements of Linusorb Names.
Notes
"a"Proposed orbitide name: [1–#-NαC], linkage occurs between amino acid 1 and amino acid “#” through the α-amino group that a N-C cyclization of the core peptide. Use the en dash (–) as in ranges and place the square brackets; [#-Xaa,#-Xaa], methionine "S"-oxide has a chiral sulfur. Two diastereomers are designated as "S"s and "R"s. Identical amino acids substituents are numbered and grouped; lin-, Genus name is recognized by three letters or from UniProt list; -us-, species name is recognized by 2 letters or name from UniProt list; -orb, common suffix for orbitide. 
"b"Name used in first literature description. 
"c"The methionine residues of amino acid sequences are highlighted in Figure 1. Abbreviations of the methionine residues are MetO for methionine "S"-oxide and MetO2 for methionine "S","S"-dioxide.

Bob West (radio host)

Bob West (March 27, 1942 – July 31, 2016) was an American ethnomusicologist, radio host, musician, and record producer. He became involved in radio in 1966 at KRAB Radio in Seattle. Lorenzo Milam, who heard him as a guest on another KRAB show, asked him in 1967 to host a weekly jazz and blues show on KRAB. A year later, West made his first field trip to Memphis to record Furry Lewis and Bukka White. In 2001 he founded Arcola Records in Seattle to create and distribute CDs of his field recordings.
Early life and education.
West began his interest in jazz and blues at an early age, with his musical interests coming from his father and mother, who collected records. His father, Frank, appreciated blues players, and favored such bands as Billie Holiday, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Fletcher Henderson, and Earl Hines. However, it was his mother, Taimi, who really liked the blues, especially Peetie Wheatstraw. After graduating from high school in Seattle in 1960 West, learning to play the trumpet, and first heard The Great Excelsior Jazz Band, featuring Ray Skjelbred, Mike Duffy, Joe Loughmuller, and others. There he met Bob Graf who was a record collector his father knew. Bob Graf became a friend and mentor. West then learned to play piano and guitar and trombone. Later West played trombone with the Great Excelsior Jazz Band.
KRAB radio and field recordings.
West was first on the air at KRAB FM in 1966. The next year he had his own show on KRAB, debuting on February 14, 1967. The KRAB program guide announced in 1967 "Rhythm and Blues. Seattle collector Bob West takes over the R&amp;B program with his extensive collection of LPs and 78s." During the first couple of years the program didn't have a consistent name. The typical description in the guide was "Bob West and his giant collection of old scratchies." His first radio interview was Bukka White in the KRAB Studio in December 1967. Bukka had been brought to Seattle by John Ullman and Seattle Folklore Society. The interview was conducted by John Ullman, Mike Duffy, and Bob West. On his show March 16, 1968, West interviewed Son House. Others interviewed included Mississippi Fred McDowell (1969), Big Joe Williams (1970), Mance Lipscomb (1972), Pinetop Perkins (1982) and Barbara Dane (1983). In 1970 he gave the title "King Biscuit Time" to his radio show, naming it after a 1941 radio program heard over KFFA in Helena, Arkansas which had been sponsored by King Biscuit Flour. He hosted King Biscuit Time until 1984 when KRAB went off the air. West made his first field recordings in Memphis in July 1968. He used his own AMPEX 601 reel to reel deck with an RCA 77 microphone that had been provided by Lorenzo Milam. The recordings were made in the house of Furry Lewis. Bukka White also took part in the recordings. West, in 1972, with Bob Graf, issued a 12-inch LP on their own ASP label of Bukka and Furry in Memphis. Over the next sixteen years Bob recorded more field interviews with Robert Pete Williams, Johnny Shines, and others.
Arcola records.
The first Arcola Records release, "Furry Lewis, Bukka White &amp; Friends, Party at Home" (2001), was composed of the field recordings from July 1968. The next two releases were Henry Townsend's "The Real St. Louis Blues" and Big Al Calhoun's "Harmonica Blues", both 2002 from field recordings in St. Louis in 1979. Babe Stovall – The Old Ace: Mississippi Blues And Religious Songs made from field recordings in New Orleans in 1968 was released in 2003. Sunnyland Slim "Long Tall Daddy with Big Time Sarah", came out of recordings made in Seattle in 1976. 
In 2005 Arcola released a two disc CD of Son House. Disc one was a field recording of a March 19, 1968, Seattle concert by Son House, arranged by the Seattle Folklore Society. Disc two began and ended with Son's 1930 song My Black Mama pts one and two. West's interview of Son in 1968 was then interspersed with 1930s recordings by Louise Johnson, Charlie Patton, Willie Brown, Rube Lacey and Robert Johnson.
Wandesforde dock.
After meeting Ray Skjelbred the first time at the Great Excelsior Jazz Band gig; West was invited to jazz events at Ray's houseboat on the Wandesforde Dock on Fairview Ave. West bought the houseboat from Ray in 1972. West lived there for 47 years. His neighbors on the dock became accustomed to his late night record-listening and jam sessions. Jazz and blues musicians visiting Seattle came to West's houseboat to relax before and after shows. West also give the house to visiting musicians, while West lived with his family. Various people who stayed at the houseboat included Bukka White, Pete Seeger, Son House, Sunnyland Slim, and many others. Every 4th of July through 2015 he had a special party for people who wanted to hear live blues and jazz and see the fireworks go off over Lake Union. For that party, he would cook up a big pot of red beans and rice with other victuals, stock up beer, and then people started arriving in the afternoon, with many staying well after midnight. Entertainment was live music and also projected 16mm jazz films. West also had a wooden rowboat that guests could take out onto Lake Union for a better view of fireworks and other boats.

In re Weitzman

In re Weitzman (1968) is a United States (U.S.) immigration law case, in which Brenda Barbara Weitzman (née Aronowitz) of South Africa and married in Israel sought U.S. citizenship, and seeking to evade the Oath of allegiance (US) military requirements, Weitzman disagreed with conscientious objector restrictions limiting objector status to only religious people, specifically, believers in a Supreme Being. She argued that she was in a bind, unable to accept an oath to United States military service due to her philosophical objection to war, and unable to claim religious objector status due to her atheism.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the lower court decision on appeal and upheld the petition. Later U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that the United States had constitutional authority in reserving objector status to religious believers only.

Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço

Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço () is a 2005 Brazilian computer-animated adventure film written by Flávio de Souza and directed by Moacyr Góes and Clewerson Saremba, produced by Diler Trindade and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Brasil and Globo Filmes. Starring Xuxa Meneghel and Pedro Malta with the participation of the voice actors Flávia Saddy, Bernardo Coutinho, Guilherme Briggs, Gustavo Pereira, Milton Gonçalves.
The film follows Guto, a 7-year-old boy who gets help from his guardian angel - Xuxinha - to fight junk-eating alien monsters that come from the planet XYZ, and will live in Pumzão Stream, right in the neighborhood where Guto and his friend Jonas live. The Pumzão is the ideal place for the invaders, who eat garbage and want to transform the Earth into a dump. The two will go through innumerable adventures and rely on the help of the wise homeless philosopher Euclides Arquimedes, Detective Txutxucão, and Jonas. But the great help comes from Heaven: Guto and Jonas' guardian angels: Xuxinha and Biel. The big heroine is the blonde angel girl, who gives up her angelic powers to save Guto and the planet.
Still in 2004, Xuxa Meneghel considered the possibility of producing a cinematographic animation later that year. The project had the first title "Adventures of Xuxinha", but the project was canceled. Almost a year after the first announcement in 2005, Xuxa announced the launch of its first animated film. Betting on a new formula, TV hots left its traditional movie format and bet on an animation. "Xuxinha e Guto", was the film is the first Brazilian animation released in 3D format.
It performed poorly at the box office, grossing just R$ 2,948,878 million reais across Brazil, with 596,218 spectators, being the worst box office performance of a Xuxa movie since "Xuxa Requebra" (1999). The film has received negative reviews from specialist critics. A sequel, came to be considered, but was canceled due to the film's box office failure.
Plot.
Like every 7-year-old, Julian (Pedro Malta) seeks answers and explanations for the existence of some spiritual beings. This is the case with the guardian angels. Xuxa Meneghel, always convinced of their existence, the elves and God, tells the nephew how he met his guardian angel, called Xuxinha.
When Xuxa grew up, she had to go her way without the help of a faithful protector. Xuxinha was given the job of protecting another child, Guto. Perhaps the most damned of all, the angel always had to do the impossible to save him from the confusions and dangers in which he entered. Xuxinha also counts on the aid of Biel, angel of the guard of Jonas, the great companion of adventures of Guto.
One day, the city is invaded by Xyzígenas, garbage-eating aliens from the planet XYZ, which is located in a distant galaxy. they escape from prison knowing that Earth's inhabitants used to throw debris into the streams, polluting all the rivers of the planet, they decided that it was the best place for domination there.
The first resident to believe in the invasion was the wise Euclid Archimedes. All but the detective dog Txutxucão, Guto and Jonas discredited him. Together, they resolve to fight these stinking monsters, who have dominated the entire punch stream. Xuxinha and Biel also resolve to investigate the case, not knowing that this involvement would bring definitive consequences to the life of the angel.
Production.
Still in 2004, Xuxa Meneghel considered the possibility of producing a film animation later that year. The project had the first title "Aventuras da Xuxinha", and would have as heroine a blonde girl, true miniature of the hots. But the project was budgeted by Ancine (Agência Nacional do Cinema), with a forecast of an expense of R$7.5 million reais, which Xuxa and its production considered very high, so the project was postponed to the year 2005, and in its place the TV hots debuted "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" at the end of that year (2004). Almost a year after the first announcement, on June 24, 2005 Xuxa announced the release of his first animated film titled "Xuxinha e Guto Contra os Monstros do Espaço", which premiered in cinemas all over Brazil in December of that year. "Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço" the film is the first Brazilian animation in second and third dimension.
"Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espaço" had a team of 70 animators from Twister studio, it was generated in computer, totally digital technology. The film is equated with Disney animations, but it did not cost 1% of the budget for such productions. The final value reached R$6 million reais, which was hosted by TV Hots itself, which boasts of the animation hub created for this production. As in the four previous films of Xuxa, the direction is of Moacyr Góes, the animation director Clewerson Saremba and the production, of Diler &amp; Associates. It took a year to get ready. It is therefore a mixture of cartoon and live action scenes (with actors acting). Betting on a new formula, TV hots Xuxa Meneghel abandons its traditional film format and this year reaches theaters in an animation. Director Clewerson Saremba explains that the film was drawn and animated completely on the computer. "The process of animation was based on that of conventional studios.The difference was to change the role for the computer when drawing". It was not by accident that Xuxa and the producer of his films Diler Trindade decided to bet on the animation this year. Clearly, there is an attempt of renewal since, every year, its productions have been earning less at the box office. Xuxa explained that he agrees with the participation of animation characters to reduce production costs:
With a script signed by Flávio de Sousa, the film is faithful to what the presenter believes. "We do not care about being educational. That's up to the school, not the TV Shows and Films," he says. Still, the theme of the film is ecology and the importance of recycling. Despite the small participation in front of the cameras, Xuxa says that he throbbed a lot in the production of the drawing. "I'm a little annoying. Sometimes she thought that Xuxinha looked fat or sneaky, she had to change. Ten seconds of film took a week to be redone. A lot of things have been thrown in the trash, hours of work." The character Xuxinha has been present in the DVDs and TV Shows of Xuxa since 1997, In the same year, the character Guto was created to represent the male children's audience of the new line of baby cleaning products. Xuxa and Pedro Malta are the only real appearances in the film, the other characters are made in computer graphics and dubbed by voice actors.
Music.
The soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2005 by Som Livre. The album consists of songs performed by the protagonist, the TV hots Xuxa Meneghel and other artists. It consists mainly of the incidental instrumental themes that played in the film, brings only two singers, Abdullah and Xuxa. Plus the track 10 that is interpreted by the actress Naná Tribuzzi. The soundtrack was produced by Ary Sperling.
Release.
The first premiere of the film took place on November 27, 2005 in city Armação dos Búzios, in the Rio de Janeiro, at the "Búzios Cine Festival". Xuxa also participated in a News conference in São Paulo on December 13 to publicize the film, and she commented on the possibility of the film winning a continuation in 2006: "This first film was to tell the story of the character. If it works out, in the next one I will participate more in the scenes". on December 17, Xuxa checked the result of the film for the first time alone. For the premiere in Rio de Janeiro city, the Queen of the little ones summoned 100 children from the "Xuxa Meneghel" Foundation and another 50 from the Brazilian Foundation "Criança Esperança", who were delighted with the performance of the animated feature, at the time, was wearing the shirt of the film. The film was officially released on December 25 in more than 180 rooms in the country.

A critic of the "Cineclick", he considered production "more bearable" than the previous ones, writing that the film "should please children.

Monster (Disney song)

"Monster" is a song from the 2018 Broadway musical "Frozen", an adaptation of the 2013 Disney animated film of the same name. Sung by Elsa, the song takes place during the second act. The song was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
Composition.
"Monster" is written in D minor and vocals span from A3 to Eb5. The song contains an allusion to Dies Irae.
Release.
The song was released on YouTube Vevo with a music video the same day the show opened on Broadway. This track was performed at New York City's Gotham Hall, and is the first of four original songs from the musical to be released weekly through the Disney on Broadway channel (the Anna and Kristof duet "What Do You Know About Love?", the Elsa solo "Dangerous to Dream", and the Anna solo "True Love").
Context.
The soliloquy ballad sees Elsa ask herself if she is evil due to her magical abilities, and wonders if the world would be better without her. She first attempts this by running away to a far-off place and building an ice tower ("Let It Go"). When a winter is triggered regardless, she considers more extreme measures.
This song takes place after Elsa has just thrown Anna and Kristoff out of the ice palace, as Hans and his men from Arendelle arrive to capture her. She thinks about the damage she has caused, while she is buried under her self-doubt, fear, and uncertainty.
Critical reception.
"The Telegraph" felt that the song "allows the audience to better understand her motivations" at this point in the story. "Mashable" deemed the piece an "earworm", while "Digital Spy" described the song as "pure Elsa".

Family Movie Night

Family Movie Night was an umbrella series of made for TV films owned and sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble and Walmart. The companies were inserting product placements within the films. Flyover Studios, P&amp;G Productions and Telenext Media Inc. were also involved producing the films. The films were aired via time buys and developed as back door pilots but none had gone to series.
Background.
Procter &amp; Gamble has been in the original content business having been involved in creating and producing the soap opera genre as a part of the early TV model of sponsored shows and other program via P&amp;G Productions.
Previously in the late 1990s, P&amp;G and Walmart had been launch members of the Association of National Advertisers' Alliance for Family Entertainment. The alliance pushed to get family-friendly programs like the WB's "Gilmore Girls" on air as they found that families with children under the age of 18 as the biggest "underserved potential viewing audience" with only short of a quarter of this group were satisfied with existing family-entertainment.
History.
Walmart decided on its Family Moments campaign which pushes additional whole family entertainment choices in-store, online and via TV. By early 2010, P&amp;G and Walmart agreed to a joint marketing program in which they would have a series of commercial made-for-TV movies produced by P&amp;G Productions to market their products. NBC was brought on board as the series' network. There were originally to be three or four films. P&amp;G Productions supposedly budget $4.5 million to make the TV film.
With the first three doing respectable numbers, including "Secrets of the Mountain" winning its night, the Family Night Partners decided in December 2010 to continue the series by purchasing time on Fox instead. None of the three films spawned a series. At that time, "Dear Annie" was casting.
P&amp;G Chairman and Chief Executive Bob McDonald, a supporter of the Family Movie Night, indicated that he felt that Wal-mart was not executing its part as well as they should by advertising more P&amp;G products in circulars or store displays. After airing 5 pilot-films, P&amp;G and Wal-Mart announced that they would continue airing four more new films for the remainder of the year 2011.

Liberation Day (Ukraine)

The Liberation Day of Ukraine (), officially the Day of Liberation of Ukraine from Fascist Invaders () is a holiday celebrated annually on October 28 in Ukraine. It commemorates the Liberation of Ukraine from Nazi Germany on 28 October 1944.
Background.
The first settlements in Eastern Ukraine were liberated by the Red Army in December 1942. Major battles for the liberation of the Ukrainian SSR lasted from January 1943 to the autumn of 1944. At this time, half of Ukraine was in the hands of the Red Army. On August 23, 1943, the city of Kharkiv was liberated. On October 27, 1944, Uzhhorod was retaken from the Germans, and Soviet troops arrived at what would be the modern western border of Ukraine. On 28 October 1944 the last territory of current Ukraine (near Uzhhorod, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) was cleared of German troops; this is annually celebrated in Ukraine (on 28 October) as the "anniversary of the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazis".
The holiday.
2004 marked the first time the anniversary was celebrated since independence. A large military parade held on Maidan Nezalezhnosti with the participation of President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Victory Banner was brought to Kyiv from Moscow to take part in the parade on Khreshchatyk. The idea of making the date a national holiday was expressed by the then Minister of Economy of Ukraine Sergey Tigipko on October 15, 2009. Five days later, President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree establishing the holiday. A couple days later, planned celebrations took place in accordance with a parliamentary decree signed in January.
On Liberation Day, the country honors of veterans and war dead, often laying wreaths and flowers at memorials. There are often exhibitions and displays of military equipment and military parades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military tattoos and local parades of Military bands take place through the main streets of local cities. Folk festivals and holiday concerts also take place.

Face (rapper)

Ivan Timofeevich Dryomin (; born 8 April 1997 in Ufa, Russia), better known by stage name Face, is a Russian rap artist who made his debut in 2015 with his EP "Cursed Print" () and has been producing music since.
Early life.
Ivan Dryomin was born on April 8, 1997 in Ufa, Russia. His father, Timofei Dryomin (born 1968), was a struggling businessman. Dryomin has an older brother, Bogdan (born 1992). Their parents divorced when the younger son was less than a year old. Both children were baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. Their mother was devoutly religious, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia when Dryomin was in the eighth grade. As a youth, Dryomin participated in boxing at school and won medals in city competitions.
In 2013, Dryomin and his friends swore a blood brother oath to the allegiance of Adolf Hitler to lead racial holy war. However, Dryomin quickly realized the wrongfulness in such white nationalist views and has since disavowed such beliefs. He was a member of the gopnik subculture and joined "Aurora Gang", a youth street gang, and was nicknamed Batei Aurora, after the street he grew up on. This gang engaged in petty crime including underage drinking, vandalizing cars, shoplifting, and street fights. In 2014, Dryomin supported himself by growing and dealing marijuana and hashish from his rented apartment. He was caught by police and sent to live with his grandmother. It was then that he turned away from his life of hooliganism due to fear of being killed or incarcerated, and started to create music.
Career.
In 2015, Dryomin attended a concert by Russian rapper Pharaoh and was inspired to make his own rap songs. His stage name Face was invented with his brother and is meant to characterize his many-sidedness and constant metamorphosis in his work. He released his debut EP "Проклятая печать" (en. "Cursed Seal") on SoundCloud on October 30, 2015. A video was released for one of its tracks, "Гоша Рубчинский" (en. "Gosha Rubchinskiy"), a homage to the fashion designer of the same name, on January 3, 2016.
Face released three EPs in 2016: "Vlone", "Mayhem", and "Playboy". He released the EP "Revenge" in 2017. He released two full-length albums, "Hate Love" and "No Love", in 2017, as well as non-album singles "Бургер" (en. "Burger") and "Я роняю запад" (en. "I'm Dropping the West"), the latter a sarcastic take on Russian patriotism with a music video that features the rapper riding a bear and standing on a burning American flag.
Face's songs are often profane, sexually explicit, and contain references to drugs, which has led to socially conservative law enforcement in Russia to cancel his concerts. In response to this censorship, he released a politically-charged album, "Пути неисповедимы" (en. "Mysterious Ways"), on September 2, 2018, that criticizes the corruption and social problems in Russia, which he has described as a "third world country." Face had received offers from President Vladimir Putin's public relations officials to produce pro-government content for the Kremlin, but turned it down.
His latest album, "Slime", was released on February 1, 2019 and spawned the singles "Woof", "Мой калашников" (en. "My Kalashnikov"), and "Спасательный Круг" (en. "Lifebuoy"). He also released the titicular soundtrack song for the Mikhail Idov drama film "Юморист" (en. "The Humorist")
Artistry and image.
Dryomin's hip hop influences include American rappers such as A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, Playboi Carti, Lil Pump and Lil Uzi Vert. Outside of rap, he also enjoys soul artist Marvin Gaye, and rock bands Best Coast, and Nirvana.
Dryomin has several tattoos, including the words "Hate" and "Love" below each of his eyes, the word "Numb" on his forehead, the Playboy bunny and Vlone logos on each of his forearms, and the words "Rock" and "Star" on the back of each hand.
Personal life.
Dryomin has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and experiences panic attacks. He received treatment for mental illness for two weeks at a psychiatric hospital. He references this event in his song "Burger": "I'm so fucking crazy, I was in the loony bin." The video for the song was partially filmed outside a psychiatric hospital named after former Moscow mayor Nikolay Alekseyev.
Dryomin moved from Ufa to Moscow with his brother Bogdan in April 2017. He has been dating Russian YouTuber Maryana Ro since September 2017.

1896 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1896 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 3, 1896, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen and many poor whites, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – and in presidential elections to a small number of counties elsewhere where blacks were not yet fully disenfranchised. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which were restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club. This restriction was done by local county laws, but combined with the highly efficacious cumulative poll tax introduced in 1877 meant that turnout declined steadily throughout the 1880s, unlike any other former Confederate state except South Carolina.
However, politics after the first demobilization was always chaotic. Third-party movements, chiefly the Populist Party, gained support amongst the remaining poor white and black voters in opposition to the planter elite. Whereas the Republican Party had not contested a statewide election seriously since 1876, the Populists made significant runs for governor in 1892, 1894 and 1896, which would have been stronger but for large scale Black Belt electoral fraud. In the presidential race the state was hit by a dispute between state Populist leader Thomas E. Watson and Maine shipbuilder Arthur Sewall over the vice-presidential nomination, which led to Watson’s frustration and fury increasing and failed to gain either candidate local support.
Vote.
The Populist political manoeuvering, combined with past alliances of Republicans with the Populist movement, had the effect of increasing Georgia’s Republican vote to the highest level seen in any presidential election since 1872 at the height of Reconstruction. Nonetheless, McKinley never campaigned in Georgia, and Bryan still carried the state by over twenty-one points.

Hope Lodge (American Cancer Society)

Hope Lodge is a charitable project run by the American Cancer Society (ACS) offering cancer patients and their caregivers a free place to stay when they are being treated in another location away from home. Patients staying at a Hope Lodge must be in active cancer treatment, and permanently reside more than 40 miles or one hour away from their cancer treatment center. Each patient must be accompanied by a caregiver.
Established in 1970, the Charleston, South Carolina Hope Lodge was the first facility to open. The concept came from Margot Freudenberg, a leader in the Charleston medical and business communities, who saw a similar facility while traveling through Australia and New Zealand with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's People to People Ambassador Program. ACS's Hope Lodge Network has expanded into more than thirty locations throughout the United States. There is also a Hope Lodge unit in Puerto Rico. Lodging and most services are offered free of charge.

Elizabethan Baroque

Elizabethan Baroque ( or ) is a term for the Russian Baroque architectural style, developed during the reign of Elizabeth of Russia between 1741 and 1762. It is also called style Rocaille or Rococo style. The Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli is the key figure of this trend, which is still given the name 'Rastrellian Baroque'. The Russian architect Savva Chevakinsky is also a renowned figure representing this style.
Style.
Unlike the former Russian Baroque styles such as Petrine Baroque, the Elizabethan Baroque tended to appreciate the Muscovite Baroque, and maintained the very essence of Russian architectural elements like the five cupolas shaped like onions.
The Elizabethan Baroque tended to create the architecture of grandeur in order to glorify the might of the Russian Empire. Rastrelli designed majestic palace complexes in Saint Petersburg and its environs: the Winter Palace, the Catherine Palace, and the Peterhof Palace. These palaces are characterized by gigantic proportions, golden splendour decorations, the use of two or three shades of colour for their façades, the refinement added by their gilding, give these buildings a particular style. The festive character of Rastrelli's work left its mark on all the Russian architecture of the middle of the eighteenth century. His most spectacular work is the Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg, the model he had made demonstrates the ambition of the original project that was not completed: the immense pyramidal steeple was never built.
Rastrelli was influenced by the French architects Germain Boffrand and Robert de Cotte; the great architects of Central Europe, from Balthasar Neumann (Würzburg) to François de Cuvilliés (Munich), from Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann (Dresden) to Fischer von Erlach (Vienna, Salzburg); the monasteries in Moscow; not to mention the reminiscences of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Italian Baroque. He adapted the Italian Baroque taste to the immensity of the landscape of St. Petersburg, his art is made of an amalgam of all these styles, which he has managed to transcend into an original synthesis, more Russian than European.
Apart from some interiors, it is not quite correct to regard this style as Rococo; for example, the fronts of the Winter Palace by Rastrelli, with exuberant coloured stuccos marked by mighty colonnades and delicate window openings, possess the solidity of the mature Baroque rather than the curvilinear lightness of the Rococo.
The Elizabethan Baroque style is also found in the works of Muscovite architects of the mid-eighteenth century, particularly those of Dmitry Ukhtomsky and Ivan Fyodorovich Michurin. In St. Petersburg, with the empress Elizabeth Petrovna, a host of architects competed in the realisation of palaces: , Savva Chevakinsky, Andrey Kvasov, among others. The Swiss architect Pietro Antonio Trezzini was the specialist in the field of religious buildings. With the exception of some constructions by Andrey Kvasov, Antonio Rinaldi, Johann Gottfried Schädel and Rastrelli's Saint Andrew's Church in Kiev, the style is rarely seen in Ukraine.
After the death of the empress Elizabeth Petrovna, the construction orders were passed to Antonio Rinaldi, who had previously worked for the small courtyard of the Oranienbaum Palace. He refused to imitate the grandiose achievements of Rastrelli and introduced the Rococo style into the architecture of the court. In the years following 1760, Rinaldi, like other renowned architects, abandoned the Baroque style and turned to the aesthetics of Classicism.

Johann Ludvig Zinn

Johann Ludvig Zinn (14 September 1734 - 3 February 1802) was a German-Danish merchant who founded a trading house in Copenhagen in 1765 and died as one of the wealthiest men in the city. Zinn lived in the Zinn House at Kvæsthusgade 3 in Copenhagen. His daughter, Sophie Dorothea Zinn, has written about her father in her memoirs, "Grandma's Confessions" ("Grandmamas Bekjendelser"). 
Early life and education.
Zinn was born in Mainbernheim in Bavaria. His parents were Johann Friederich Zinn and Dorothea Barbara Zinn, née Kreis. It is unclear whether he was related to the renowned botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759), who came from the same region (Ansbach) and who gave his name to the Zinnia flower.
Career and public life.
Instigated by Johan Friederich Wewer, Zinn came to Denmark in 1757 where he initially worked for Fabritius &amp; Wewer. He established his own trading house in 1765, and was appointed Royal Agent in 1779.
Zinn served as a commercial specialist judge at Copenhagen's Maritime Court and was a member of the city's Council of 32 Men in 1772–1802. He also served as Statutory auditor In Danish Asia Company.

1892 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1892 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 8, 1892, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background and vote.
Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen and many poor whites, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – and in presidential elections to a small number of counties elsewhere where blacks were not fully disenfranchised. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which were restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club. This restriction was done by local county laws, but combined with the highly efficacious cumulative poll tax introduced in 1877 meant that turnout declined steadily throughout the 1880s, unlike any other former Confederate state except South Carolina.
However, politics after the first demobilization was always chaotic. Third-party movements, chiefly the Populist Party, gained support amongst the remaining poor white and black voters in opposition to the planter elite. Whereas the Republican Party had not contested a statewide election seriously since 1876, the Populists made a significant run for governor in 1892 as they launched the most significant third-party campaign since John Bell in the sectionally divided 1860 election. In Georgia, the Populists would be led by Thomas E. Watson, who had won a seat in Congress in 1890.
However, the strong emphasis by Cleveland and running mate Adlai Stevenson I on opposing the Lodge Force Bill and on reducing tariffs was able to reduce defections to the Populists or the GOP, despite strong opposition in the state to Cleveland’s rigid support for the gold standard against free silver. The Populist influence caused voter turnout to rise substantially – some believing that many new voters had their poll taxes paid for – but despite opposition forces gaining more than twice as many votes as in 1888 Cleveland’s margin fell by less than five percent as his opposition was divided. Rather than in the poor white upcountry counties, Weaver actually did best in the northeastern part of the Black Belt where Watson was based and where Populist strength would remain greatest in 1904 and 1908.

2014 Hwaebul Cup

The 2014 Hwaebul Cup was the second edition of the Hwaebul Cup (홰불, "Torch") celebrating North Korea's Youth Day. The competition was held between 10 and 28 August 2013, with all matches played at the Yanggakdo Stadium in P'yŏngyang. The competition was arranged in two phases, a group stage followed by a single-elimination play-off semi-finals, and a single-game final.
Group Stage.
Thirteen teams took part in the group stage, with seven in Group A and six in Group B.
Group A.
Group A was made up of Hwaebul, Kyŏnggong'ŏp, Kwanmobong, Wŏlmido, April 25, Amrokkang, and Ryong'aksan. The group stage opened with a match between Hwaebul and Kyŏnggong'ŏp on 10 August. Hwaebul, considered heavy favourites at the start of the tournament, won with a convincing 3-0 score, going on to win their next three matches against Kwanmobong (5-0), Wŏlmido and April 25 (1-0). April 25 had started out the competition by winning their first four matches, 4-1 against Amrokkang, 3-1 against Kyŏnggong'ŏp, 3-0 against Ryong'aksan, and 3-0 against Kwanmobong. Ryong'aksan had started off with a 3-2 win over Kwanmobong, whilst Wŏlmido and Amrokkang drew 1-1 in their opening match. Hwaebul and April 25 went on to advance to the semi-finals.
"Table based on known results."
Group B.
Group B included Sobaeksu, P'yŏngyang City, Myohyangsan, Ponghwasan, Rimyŏngsu, and one other club. Rimyŏngsu had been tipped as favourites, but the opening match of the group, that they played against Sobaeksu, surprised observers with a 3-2 result in favour of Sobaeksu on 15 August. The group was topped by Sobaeksu and P'yŏngyang City, both of which had had two wins and two draws in their first four matches. 
"Table based on known results."
Semi-finals.
Hwaebul and April 25 qualified for the semi-finals from Group A, and Sobaeksu and P'yŏngyang City from Group B; the first place finisher of each group played the second-place team from the other group. April 25 and Hwaebul won their matches to advance to the final.
Final.
Hwaebul and April 25 advanced to the final, which was played at Yanggakdo Stadium on 28 August, with April 25 emerging victorious with a 1-0 score.

Consequently, Cleveland would gain five percent on his 1884 percentage in Georgia as opposition turnout fell by one-seventh.

The Big Four Tournament was an annual college basketball tournament played from 1971 to 1981 in Greensboro, North Carolina. The field consisted of the "Big Four" North Carolina Atlantic Coast Conference schools: NC State Wolfpack, Duke Blue Devils, North Carolina Tar Heels, and Wake Forest Demon Deacons. The four previously participated in the Dixie Classic from 1949–1960.
The tournament was held in December, before the Holiday season started, and consisted of two rounds. Each team would play one other team. The two winners then played for the championship and the two losers would play for third place. The games did not count in the ACC standings, but did count on a team's overall seasonal record, as did their team and individual stats.
The tournament came to an end in 1981, when participating schools and their coaches decided that the extra competition, aggravation of playing top conference rivals a "third" time each season, and the toll of all but one team getting one or more losses on its record so early in the season, outweighed their share of the gate and media revenues, substantial fan interest, and the chance to test themselves against the best in the ACC without the outcome affecting their conference records.

Neilank Jha

Neilank Jha () is a Canadian neurosurgeon specializing in concussions. Based in the city of Toronto, Neilank Jha established KonKussion, a hotline to address concussion injuries, which is staffed by neurosurgeons and neurologists to provide medical prognoses and treatment plans to physicians and nurses. In addition, Jha has pioneered clinical management guidelines for concussions through working with others in his field, internationally. Neilank Jha also established the first academic journal dedicated to the research of concussions.
Early life and career.
Neilank was born in Edmonton, Alberta and grew up in Regina, Saskatchewan where he had a passion for playing hockey. At age twelve, he moved to India, where he lived in an ashram until he was seventeen. Through his monastic experience in South Asia, Neilank Jha practiced asceticism, sleeping on the floor and owning only two sets of clothes.
Upon his return to Canada, Neilank pursued his undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, medical school and neurosurgical residency at McMaster University, and spinal surgery fellowship at the University of Toronto.
At McMaster University, Neilank Jha was the chief resident in neurosurgery in 2010 when his mother, herself a nurse, suffered a concussion after falling down a flight of stairs. Her CAT scan was normal and she was diagnosed with a concussion and discharged from the hospital a few hours later and advised to return to work in a few days. She was unable to return to work as a nurse due to “persistent cognitive challenges and headaches”. Months later with no explanation for her persistent symptoms, no objective diagnostic tool or proven treatment she remained off work. This experience resulting in Neilank dedicating his life to concussion management and research, a departure from his extensive training in operating on the brain and spine.
Neilank has become an advocate for patients with concussions and has urged professional sports leagues to invest in R&amp;D and better protocols to protect current and future athletes while also committing resources for retired athletes." Neilank has encouraged the responsible management of concussions in both athletes and non-athletes.
Research.
Neilank Chaired an International Concussion Conference in Toronto in September 2015 and published a white paper entitled ‘Solving the concussion crisis’, co-authored by others in the field. The publication "finalize[s] an international consensus by which concussive traumatic brain injuries are understood".
Neilank has conducted research evaluating the potential therapeutic benefit of cannabinoids in the management of traumatic brain injury. Early human studies have demonstrated encouraging results and additional studies are pending. 
KonKussion.
Neilank Jha established KonKussion, a hotline to address concussion injuries, which is staffed by neurosurgeons and neurologists to provide medical prognoses and treatment plans to physicians and nurses. Neilank Jha personally attends to 200 concussion cases per week through KonKussion.

The Alec Baldwin Show

The Alec Baldwin Show is an American talk show hosted by actor Alec Baldwin that premiered on March 4, 2018, on ABC. The series is Baldwin's second talk show following 2013's "Up Late with Alec Baldwin" on MSNBC and the first prime-time personality talk show to air on a major broadcast network since NBC's "The Jay Leno Show" ended its run in 2010.
Premise.
"The Alec Baldwin Show" is set to "include two interviews per show, letting them collectively stretch the entire hour, save commercial breaks. Like his podcast, which has featured lengthy conversations with everyone from Barbra Streisand to Anthony Weiner." The show "will line up actors, comedians, politicians and other newsmakers in the American pop culture sphere as guests."
Production.
Development.
On February 27, 2018, it was announced that ABC had given a series order to "Sundays with Alec Baldwin", a new talk show television series created and presented by Alec Baldwin. The series order was reportedly for a first season of nine episodes. The pilot episode aired after the 90th Academy Awards as a "sneak peek" on March 4, 2018. Production companies involved in the series include Baldwin's company El Dorado Pictures.
In an interview with "The Hollywood Reporter"s Lacey Rose, Baldwin went on to elaborate on his reasons for committing to the program. He explained how the limited number of episodes allowed for greater freedom and discretion when it comes to selecting guests. He specified the type of guests they were looking for saying, "The idea of doing a TV show was never really that attractive to me—because when we do the show for radio, it's one kind of reality. The minute you put a camera on people, they change...Why don't we try it and see if we get people who are more camera-ready? I wouldn't mind interviewing Jennifer Lawrence or somebody if we could find an angle that was different or fresh." Notable personalities that Baldwin mentioned as possible guests included Stephen King, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, and Bruce Springsteen.
On May 15, 2018, it was announced that the series, now retitled "The Alec Baldwin Show", would officially premiere in the fall of 2018 and air on Sundays at 10 PM On October 9, 2018, it was announced that the first formal episode of the series was scheduled to premiere on October 14, 2018, and that Robert De Niro and Taraji P. Henson would serve as guests. Subsequent guests were expected to include Kim Kardashian West, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., RuPaul, Kerry Washington, Cecile Richards, Jeff Bridges, Sarah Jessica Parker, Chris Christie, Mike Myers, Regina King, Gloria Allred, Ricky Gervais, and Erna Solberg. On November 6, 2018, it was announced that ABC was moving the series from Sunday nights at 10 PM to a new time slot on Saturdays at 10 PM. The show was expected to return in its new time slot on December 8, 2018. On January 4, 2019, it was reported that ABC was pulling the show from its schedule and replacing it with reruns of other shows beginning the following night.
Marketing.
On March 2, 2018, ABC released the first clips and photographs from the series.
Reception.
The series has been met with a negative response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 0% approval rating, with an average rating of 3.72 out of 10 based on 7 reviews.
Upon airing, the pilot episode was met with a mixed response from critics. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned "Sundays with Alec Baldwin" a score of 47 out of 100 based on five critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". In a positive review, Verne Gay of "Newsday" offered the pilot praise giving it two and a half stars out of four commenting on its potential, saying, "Baldwin is the sort of star—either actor, talk show host, POTUS, whatever—who elicits passion. Some people love him, others not so much. There's no middle ground and never has been, and into this no man's land he steps, along with future guests. Nobody's neutral about him, and their neutrality will be tested as much as his. The show's potential will rise or fall in those edgy encounters when they come, and they certainly should. That passion could ultimately be "Sundays" chief asset." In a more negative critique, Kelly Lawler of "USA Today" said of the pilot, "Baldwin, who had a short-lived talk show on MSNBC in 2013, is a decent interviewer, but the talk never gets too deep or reveals new insights about his subjects" and that he "tries his level best, but the show is too slight to really click. It just might not be his Sunday."

1880 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1880 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 2, 1880, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 11 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background and vote.
Following Reconstruction, Georgia would be the first former Confederate state to substantially disenfranchise its newly enfranchised freedmen and many poor whites, doing so in the early 1870s. This largely limited the Republican Party to a few North Georgia counties with substantial Civil War Unionist sentiment – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – and in presidential elections to a small number of counties elsewhere where blacks were not fully disenfranchised. The Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction, and the main competition became Democratic primaries, which were restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club. This restriction was done by local county laws, but combined with the highly efficacious cumulative poll tax introduced in 1877 meant that turnout would begin a decline to be consistently lower than any other former Confederate state except South Carolina.
Despite the failure of outgoing President Rutherford B. Hayes to convert any of the formerly Whig landowners to the GOP, Democratic nominee Winfield Scott Hancock declined by seven percent upon Samuel J. Tilden’s performance in Georgia from 1876, as mountain country whites who could pay the poll tax were nonetheless dissatisfied with the spending cuts of the “Redeemers” and their economic problems from deflation and a regressive and malapportioned tax system.

Jøssund (municipality)

Jøssund is a former municipality in the old Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1896 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality encompassed northern coastal area of the present-day municipality of Ørland in Trøndelag county. The main church for Jøssund was Jøssund Church in the village of Jøssund which was the administrative centre of the municipality. Other villages in Jøssund included Lysøysundet and Vallersund.
History.
The municipality of Jøssund was established on 1 January 1896 when it was split off from the large municipality of Aafjord. Initially, Jøssund had a population of 1,529. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Jøssund (population: 1,917) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Bjugn (population: 1,240), Nes (population: 1,107), and the northern part of Stjørna (population: 676) to form a new, larger municipality of Bjugn.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Jøssund, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor.

Attukal Pongala

Attukal Pongala is a 10-day religious festival celebrated at the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram in the Indian state of Kerala. On the ninth day there is a huge gathering of millions of women on the temple surroundings. These women prepare a divine food made of rice in earthen pots and offer it to the Attukal Amma (Goddess of the Temple). The pongala preparation starts with the ritual called 'Aduppuvettu'. This is the lighting of the pongala hearth (called Pandarayaduppu) placed inside the temple by the chief priest. This is the earliest Pongala festival in Kerala.
The festival is marked as the largest annual gathering of women by the Guinness World Records. The ceremony was set up in Guinness Book of World Records on February 23, 1997, when 1.5 million women participated in Pongala. In 2009, a new Guinness World Records celebrated 2.5 million attendance. This temple is also known as the "Sabarimala for women".
Though it is a Hindu festival, many Christian women in Kerala also offers Pongala to the Goddess.
The Attukal Pongala was held on March 9, 2020. The Attukal Pongala event started at 10.20 am and ends at 2.10 pm with the traditional Nivedyam. Thousands of women participated despite the high alert from the state government against large gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next Attukal Pongala will be held on February 27, 2021.

<doc id="56707971" url="?curid=56707971" title="Microtis orbicularis">
Microtis orbicularis

Microtis orbicularis, commonly known as the dark mignonette orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to southern Australia. It has a single thin, more or less hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small yellowish-green and red flowers. The plants grow in winter-wet areas, often in shallow water and unlike the similar "M. cupularis" do not turn black as they dry.
Description.
"Microtis orbicularis" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, almost tubular leaf long and about wide. Between three and thirty yellowish-green and reddish flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem , reaching to a height of tall. The flowers are about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear, about long, wide, pressed against the ovary and hidden below the labellum. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and spread apart below the dorsal sepal. The labellum is more or less round, shallow cup-shaped, fleshy, long and wide. Flowering occurs from September to December.
Taxonomy and naming.
The dark mignonette orchid was first formally described in 1907 by Richard Sanders Rogers from a specimen collected from a swamp near Myponga. In 2002, David Jones and Garry Brockman changed the name to "Hydrorchis cupularis" but the change has not been accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. The specific epithet ("orbicularis") is a Latin word meaning "orbicular" or "having the form of a small circle", referring to the shape of the labellum.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis orbicularis" grows in swamps and seasonally wet depressions, sometimes with the base of the plant submerged. It is found between Dongara and Cape Le Grand in Western Australia, in coastal areas of eastern South Australia as far west as the Eyre Peninsula, in the south-west of Victoria and on the north coast of Tasmania.
Conservation.
"Microtis orbicularis" is classified as "not threatened" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Astan Bandar

Astan Bandar is an annual religious local Majlis (marsiya khani) organised by the local villagers at the shrine of Aga Mir Syed Mohammad Baqir Mosavi in Wahabpora every year in the month of August or September. People gather from all walks of life to hold Majlis from different parts of the district. Marsiya is started followed by recitation of the Quran. It starts in the morning to the evening. At the end rice with meat is distributed among the people.
History.
It is said that this Majlis started in 1500 A.D. It was started as the protection of crops in the village. The different crops of the villagers were destroyed because of many natural disasters and it was kept as devotion (nazr) to protect the all crops especially rice. Due to Unrest in Kashmir in 2008, 2010 and 2016 this Majlis was organised only for a short period of time. Some years ago the local farmers slaughtered Kashmiri cocks near their rice crop-fields. But this custom remains no longer.
Etymology.
The term Astan Bandar is composed of two-word Astan and Bandar. Astan means shrine and Bandar means devotion of food or any other thing. On this day the people devote food and meat at the shrine of Aga Mir Syed Mohammad Baqir Mosavi. So it is called "Astan Bandar" or "Devotion at the Shrine". Other name of Astan Bandar is "Baly-khani".
Due to lockdown and spread of COVID-19 pandemic Astan Bandar was postponed in the previous year. The management committee announced this announcement when the date of event was coming close. In 2021 Astan Bandar will be organised in the month of September after the month of Moharram-ul-Harram.

Nes, Fosen

Nes is a former municipality in the old Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1899 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality encompassed the coastal land north of the Bjugnfjorden as well as the Tarva islands in what is now the municipality of Ørland in Trøndelag county. The administrative centre of Nes was the village of Nes where the Nes Church is located.
History.
The municipality of "Nes" was established on 1 January 1899 when the old municipality of Bjugn was split into three separate municipalities: Bjugn (population: 1,256), Skjørn (population: 2,166), and Nes (population: 1,285). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Nes (population: 1,107) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Bjugn (population: 1,240), Jøssund (population: 1,917), and the northern part of Stjørna (population: 676) to form a new, larger municipality of Bjugn.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Nes, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor.
Municipal council.
The municipal council of Nes was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows:

HMS Cormorant (1781)

HMS "Cormorant" was probably launched in 1780 at Plymouth, Massachusetts. She was commissioned as the Massachusetts privateer "Rattlesnake" in 1781. The Royal Navy captured her shortly after she set out on a cruise and purchased her. In November 1781 she carried to England the first news of General Cornwallis's defeat. The Royal Navy registered her under the name "Cormorant". In 1783 the navy renamed her "Rattlesnake". It paid her off and sold her in 1786.
Privateer "Rattlesnake".
"Rattlesnake" was probably drawn by John Peck of Boston, Massachusetts, and probably built at Plymouth in 1780. She was very lightly built and was reputedly very fast. "Rattlesnake" had the appearance of a miniature frigate, with detached quarterdeck and forecastle.
"Rattlesnake" was commissioned on 12 June 1781 under Commander Mark Clark (or Clarke). She had barely begun her first cruise when she encountered the 44-gun frigate , Captain James Cumming.
"Assurance" captured "Rattlesnake" on 17 June. He sent her into New York, where she arrived on 8 July. The Royal Navy purchased her on 28 July at Boston.
HMS "Rattlesnake".
Captain John Melcombe assumed command in September, sailed to England on 29 October, and arrived in late November. Melcombe arrived at the Admiralty on the Sunday evening before 27 November, bearing the news that General Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown. (All the reports of Melcombe's arrival refer to him as Captain of His Majesty's sloop "Rattlesnake".)
The Navy registered "Rattlesnake" on 30 November, as HMS "Cormorant", there being a already in service, and just having been lost.
HMS "Cormorant".
"Cormorant" underwent fitting at Plymouth between November 1781 and February 1782. On 19 July 1782 "Cormorant" recaptured "Marine". On 2 July "Marine", Rendel, master, had put Torbay, having been chased near Plymouth by a French privateer while "Marine" was sailing from Darmouth to Ireland.
On 30 July "Cormorant" captured the 10-gun naval cutter west south west of Cape Clear. She was armed with ten 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 50 men under the command of "lieutenant de fregate" LeFer. She was nine days out of Brest and taking dispatches to the combined fleets. Before he struck Le Fer threw overboard the dispatches, her logbook and papers, and eight guns. She then arrived at Cork.
In August 1783 the Navy renamed "Cormorant" "Rattlesnake", and Commander John Melcombe recommissioned her.
HMS "Rattlesnake".
On 3 November 1783 "Rattlesnake" sailed for the Mediterranean.
On 10 November 1784, "Rattlesnake", Captain Melcombe, was escorting the merchantman "Countess of Tuscany" to Gibraltar when they encountered an Algerine naval squadron of nine ships under the command of an admiral. The Algerine admiral pretended to believe that "Rattlesnake" was not a British warship and compelled both vessels to put into Algiers. There the Dey of Algiers detained them for five days before releasing them, without apology.
On 29 November 1785 Commander Thomas Hamilton replaced Melcome.
Fate.
In July 1786, "Rattlesnake" was paid off. She was sold on 10 October.

Kiryas Joel murder conspiracy

The Kiryas Joel murder conspiracy was the planned kidnapping and murder of Joseph Masri, a Hasidic resident of the village of Kiryas Joel, New York in a troubled marriage who had refused to give his wife a get (divorce document). The plot was hatched during the summer of 2016 by Shimen Liebowitz, a divorce mediator from Kiryas Joel, Aharon Goldberg, an Israeli rabbi from Bnei Brak, and Binyamin Gottlieb. A fourth conspirator, operating under the pseudonym Joe Levin, turned out to be an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose agents arrested the suspects in a sting operation before the crime could be committed. The trio were convicted and sentenced in 2017 to prison.
Background.
Under Jewish marital law, a married woman who wishes to remarry cannot do so until her husband first provides her with a divorce document known as a "get", or otherwise upon his death. A woman who lacks the ability to remarry is known as an agunah.
Joseph Masri, a taxi driver from Kiryas Joel, New York had been living there with his wife and children when his marriage started to have problems. At one point he separated from his family, moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn to live with his father. His wife began to reach out to prominent rabbis of the community seeking permission to remarry.
Kidnapping and murder plot.
Shimen Liebowitz, a Satmar Hasid raised in Melbourne, Australia who came to Kiryas Joel at the age of 16 to attend the rabbinical college there, was an internet entrepreneur who dabbled in divorce mediation as a sideline. He was approached by the wife's family to see if anything could be done to convince Masri to grant her a divorce, who by this point had been waiting 10 years for the document. Liebowitz turned to Aharon Goldberg, a Satmar affiliated Israeli rabbi prominent in the Kiryas Joel community who stated that while he is "very strong" in obtaining "gets" in Israel, he hasn't any "soldiers" for this purpose in the United States.
In July 2016, an Airmont, New York man and father of 5 named Binyamin Gottlieb, alleged to having had a history of forcing "gets", introduced the pair to Joe Levin, an informant whose real name was Avraham Lehrer. Levin, who advertised himself as a private investigator and divorce consultant to the Orthodox community was later described by defense attorneys as a "small-time fraudster" who disliked members of the Satmar sect. The three held a meeting in Rockland County, New York where a payment of $25,000 was discussed, and the possibilities of kidnapping Masri in Pennsylvania or Ukraine, a country that Masri intended to travel to for Rosh Hashanah, in order to torture him there into giving the get. Gottlieb delivered the payment, and discussed the possibility of luring the victim to Puerto Rico. On August 9, 2016, a second meeting of the three near Zenta Road in Kiryas Joel that was recorded by Levin for the FBI, narrowed down the plot to Ukraine. During a meeting of the three held 3 days later, the venue was changed back to the United States, and the two men gave Levin an additional $20,000 for planning.
Goldberg subsequently met Levin in Israel, where the former expressed his desire to not only kidnap Masri but also to kill him.
On August 25, 2016, Liebowitz met up with Levin at Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, New York to pay him an additional $12,000 that he had demanded. Levin called Goldberg, who was in Israel at the time, and spoke to him in Modern Hebrew over speakerphone about the "wedding in America," understood by the FBI to be a reference to the kidnapping that was to take place in the U.S.:
using a Hebrew term that refers to caring for the dead. After a brief silence, Goldberg responded,
On September 2, 2016, Levin met Liebowitz at Woodbury Commons, and from the conversation they had he appeared to know exactly what Goldberg had planned, even though Liebowitz did not understand the Modern Hebrew language. Liebowitz opined that Masri, a taxi driver who occasionally traveled to Montreal could "miss a night, or even two or three" before his family grew concerned. Liebowitz added:
Liebowitz then laughed and said he would carry on as if he knew nothing, letting the blame fall to Goldberg and the wife's family.
Although Leibowitz later questioned the need to kill the victim instead of merely torturing him, Levin suggested they change the operation from a kidnapping to a murder.
Arrests and convictions.
On September 6, 2016 Goldberg and Liebowitz met with Levin at a hotel in Central Valley. Levin told the two that "Masri was half dead already," and they agreed to "do the bullet." Goldberg said he would need proof of death to present to the beth din in order to declare the marriage over. Liebowitz asked Goldberg:
As Levin promised to give Goldberg a video of the victim with a bullet in his head, the FBI burst in and arrested Goldberg and Liebowitz.
At a news conference the following day, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara referred to the plot as "chilling."
On September 11, 2016, Binyamin Gottlieb was arrested as he boarded a flight to Ukraine at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.
On July 27, 2017, Liebowitz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion.
On September 15, 2017, Gottlieb pleaded guilty to concealing a felony.
On September 28, 2017, Goldberg pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder-for-hire.
On November 30, 2017, U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein sentenced Goldberg to 3 years in prison, Liebowitz to 2 years, and Gottlieb to 1 year's probation.

Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis

The Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis was a contraction of the West African rainforest which happened around 600 BC. The forests is believed to have dried; large parts gave way to savanna. After around 600 years the forests had recovered in the equatorial zone. As causes for the crisis, the prevailing theory is precessive natural precipitation change but human suppression of jungle affected the forests to an unknown extent.

Hans Conrad Thoresen

Hans Conrad Thoresen (July 28, 1802 – June 11, 1858) was a Norwegian priest, a member of the Storting, and Henrik Ibsen's father-in-law. 
Thoresen was born the son of a cooper in Tønsberg. He passed his theological exam in 1825 and served as a priest in Sunnmøre from 1826 to 1843. From 1828 onward he was also a provost in Herøy, where he was Ivar Aasen's first teacher. Among other things, Thoresen taught Aasen rhetoric using Jacob Rosted's work "Forsøg til en Rethorik" (Introduction to Rhetoric).
His first wife was Marie Dorothea Sophie Münster (1803–1827). Thoresen's second marriage was to Sara Margrethe Daae (April 6, 1806 – May 10, 1841), the daughter of the priest Johan Christopher Haar Daae. The two of them had five children, and their daughter Suzannah later married Henrik Ibsen. Sara Daae was also the aunt of the politician Ludvig Daae. Thoresen's third wife was the author Anna Magdalene Kragh (1819–1903). Magdalene accepted a position as a governess with Thoresen in 1842; in June 1843, she gave birth to a son, who was placed in foster care in Copenhagen, and she then married Thoresen in October 1843. According to Aagaat Daae, Magdalene Kragh came to Herøy in 1842. Magdalene became a stepmother to Thoresen's daughter Suzannah.
In July 1843 he was named parish priest at Holy Cross Church in Bergen and the family relocated to Bergen in 1844. From 1844 to 1861, the Thoreson house in Bergen served as a cultural center. In Bergen, people such as Bishop Jacob Neumann, the educators Lyder Sagen and Hans Holmboe, and Henrik Ibsen belonged to the Thoresens' circle of acquaintances. Henrik Ibsen was first invited to the Thoresen home early in 1856, and he married their daughter Suzannah two years later, only three days after her father's funeral.
Thoresen represented Romsdal county in the Storting from 1842 to 1844. According to Aagaat Daae, he represented Romsdal county in the Storting in 1848. He served on many settlement committees for Herøy.
Aage Schavland took over as parish priest in Herøy when Thoresen relocated to Bergen. Schavland's daughter Anne Kristine was married to Ludvig Daae, Suzannah Thoresen's cousin.
Thoresen died in Bergen while serving as the provost at Holy Cross Church.

History of civil rights in the United States

Civil rights in the United States include noted legislation and organized efforts to abolish public and private acts of racial discrimination against Native Americans, African Americans, Asians, Latin Americans, women, homeless, minority religions, and other groups since the independence of the country.
Background.
Many events took place between 1776 and 1866, some of there are the following: 
Slavery in the United States (1776 - 1886).
United States of America allowed the enslavement of human beings, most of them Africans and African Americans that were moved from their continent and taken their freedom. The process of slavery started in the 16th century during the british colonization of the Americas.
Racial segregation in the United States.
Racial segregation follows two forms; 
Frederick Douglass and James N. Buffum.
In 1841 Frederick Douglass and his friend James N. Buffum entered a train car reserved for white passengers in Lynn, Massachusetts, when the conductor ordered them to leave the car, they refused. Followed the action widespread organizing led the congress to approve the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which grant equal rights to Black citizens in public accommodations. In 1883 the Supreme Court overturned this victory declaring it unconstitutional. 
Elizabeth Jennings Graham.
On July 16, 1854, Elizabeth Jennings Graham, a 24-year-old schoolteacher opted for aboard a bus without the “Colored Persons Allowed” sign, the conductor used force to expel her.
Charlotte L. Brown.
On 1863, San Francisco's horse-powered streetcar companies accepted only white passengers). On April 17, 1863, Charlotte L. Brown, an African American citizens began to directly challenge this discrimination and boarded a streetcar of the Omnibus Railroad Company, but she was forced off, she tried to do it two more time, but the same happen, each time legally sued the company.
Demand for women's suffrage in the United States.
The demand for women's suffrage began to gather strength in the 1840s, emerging from the broader movement for women's rights. In 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, passed a resolution in favor of women's suffrage despite opposition from some of its organizers, who believed the idea was too extreme. By the time of the first National Women's Rights Convention in 1850, however, suffrage was becoming an increasingly important aspect of the movement's activities.
Movement for civil rights from 1865–1896).
The civil rights movement (1865–1896) aimed to eliminate racial discrimination against African Americans, improve their educational and employment opportunities, and establish their electoral power, just after the abolition of slavery in the United States. The period from 1865 to 1895 saw a tremendous change in the fortunes of the black community following the elimination of slavery in the South.Copied content from Civil rights movement (1865–1896&lt;/ref&gt; 
End of slavery in the United States of America.
The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of three million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves.
Civil Rights Act of 1866.
The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was the first United States federal law to define citizenship and affirm that all citizens are equally protected by the law. It was mainly intended, in the wake of the American Civil War, to protect the civil rights of persons of African descent born in or brought to the United States. 
The Act was passed by Congress in 1865 and vetoed by United States President Andrew Johnson. In April 1866 Congress again passed the bill to support the Thirteenth Amendment, and Johnson again vetoed it, but a two-thirds majority in each chamber overrode the veto to allow it to become law without presidential signature. John Bingham and other congressmen argued that Congress did not yet have sufficient constitutional power to enact this law. Following passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, Congress ratified the 1866 Act in 1870. In 1871 was passed the US Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the Klan Act. In 1875 the Civil Rights Act of 1875 Becomes law. 
Katherine "Kate" Brown.
Katherine Brown boarded a train in Alexandria, Virginia when traveling towards Washington, D.C. on February 8, 1868, Brow, She entered "what they call the 'white people's car.'" As she was boarding, a railroad policeman told her to move to a different car. He told her the car she had entered "was for ladies," and "no damned niger was allowed to ride in that car; never was and never would be." She replied, "This car will do." The railroad police officer and another employee grabbed Brown and, after a violent struggle that lasted six minutes, in which she was beaten and kicked, threw her on the boarding platform, dragged her along the platform and threatened to arrest her. She asked, "What are you going to arrest me for? What have I done? Have I committed robbery? Have I murdered anybody?" Brown's injuries were so severe that she was bedridden for several weeks and spit up blood.
Senators Charles Sumner and Justin Morrill called for a formal investigation, and Senator Charles Drake agreed. A resolution was passed on February 10, and Senate committee heard testimony later that month. Brown sued the railway company for damages and was awarded $1,500 in damages in the district court. The railway company appealed, and the case eventually went before the US Supreme Court. On November 17, 1873, in an opinion delivered by Justice David Davis, the Court held that racial segregation on the railroad line was not allowed under its Congressional charter, which stated "no person shall be excluded from the cars on account of race."Davis dismissed the company's "separate but equal" argument as "an ingenious attempt to evade a compliance with the obvious meaning of the requirement" of the 1863 charter and decided in favor of Brown.
The Court held that white and black passengers must be treated with equality in the use of the railroad's cars:
Movement for civil rights from 1896 to 1954.
The civil rights movement (1896–1954) was a long, primarily nonviolent series of events to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans. The era has had a lasting impact on American society – in its tactics, the increased social and legal acceptance of civil rights, and in its exposure of the prevalence and cost of racism. 
Women's suffrage in the United States.
Women's legal right to vote was established in the United States over the course of more than half a century, first in various states and localities, sometimes on a limited basis, and then nationally in 1920. 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is an international document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly that enshrines the rights and freedoms of all human beings. It was accepted by the General Assembly as Resolution 217 during its third session on 10 December 1948 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France. 
A foundational text in the history of human and civil rights, the Declaration consists of 30 articles detailing an individual's "basic rights and fundamental freedoms" and affirming their universal character as inherent, inalienable, and applicable to all human beings. Adopted as a "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations", the UDHR commits nations to recognize all humans as being "born free and equal in dignity and rights" regardless of "nationality, place of residence, gender, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status". 
The Declaration is considered a "milestone document" for its "universalist language", which makes no reference to a particular culture, political system, or religion. It directly inspired the development of international human rights law, and was the first step in the formulation of the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966 and came into force in 1976. United States of America has ratified the nine binding treaties influenced by the Declaration. 
Civil rights movement 1954—1968.
The 1954–1968 civil rights movement in the United States was preceded by a decades-long campaign by African Americans and their like-minded allies to end legalized racial discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States. The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, although it made its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans. 
End of racial segregation in the United States.
De jure segregation was outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In specific areas, however, segregation was barred earlier by the Warren Court in decisions such as the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision that overturned school segregation in the United States. 
Civil rights in the 21st century.
"De facto" segregation continues today in areas such as residential segregation and school segregation because of both contemporary behavior and the historical legacy of "de jure" segregation. 
Erradication of Homelessness has also been a major problem in the United States, in 2010 1,593,150 individuals experienced homelessness The Coronavirus pandemic of 2019 to 2021 forced governments to mandate lockdowns and thousands of companies to close business temporarily or permanently, leaving them without resources to pay the rent and the salary of their employees, forcing them to close business permanently, being evicted and lost their equipments. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and were unable to pay the rent, 7 millions of them are facing eviction in October 2021.
Various laws have both directly and indirectly criminalized people that are homeless and people attempting to feed homeless people outdoors. At least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.

Siti Masitha Soeparno is an Indonesian businesswoman and politician. She served as the mayor of Tegal in Central Java from 2014 to 2017.
On the evening of Tuesday, 29 August 2017, Soeparno was arrested on graft charges by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), leading to her removal from office. Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo referred to her arrest as a heavy blow to the entire province and called for a meeting of all mayors as a warning. Soeparno was arrested during a city council meeting at her official residence at the city hall complex. The Commission sealed the Kardinah Regional General Hospital just before the arrest, and the charges were allegedly related to Soeparno's approval of a new ICU built at the hospital. Her arrest occurred during a nationwide sweep of ten local officials by the Commission between July and September 2017.
Soeparno's predecessor, Ikmal Jaya, was also removed from office by the KPK due to corruption, meaning two consecutive mayors of Tegal have been removed on graft charges.

Arranging to a two-year agreement with Lyn of the Norwegian Premier League in February 2004, Marques was second-string goalkeeper behind Ali Al-Habsi and was sent to FK Tønsberg for the rest of the 2005 season. Next, he trialed with Bryne, who were in the Norwegian 1. Divisjon, earning a contract lasting until 2008. Despite being the second-choice goalkeeper at Bryne, the Benfica youth graduate started the first round of the 2007 Norwegian First Division away to Løv-Ham, earning praise from his coach despite losing the game. However, the Portuguese goalkeeper picked up a knee injury in May that year, leaving him out for the rest of the season. By 2008, Marques was at Notodden FK, then of the Norwegian First Division, repudiating rumors of Greek clubs signing him.

Gustav Warneck

Gustav Adolf Warneck (1834–1910) was a German missiologist. In 1874, he established the first German missiological journal, "Allgemeine Missionszeitschift". He was also involved in the founding of the German Protestant Missions Committee in 1885, serving as secretary until 1901. He held the first university chair in missiology at Halle University from 1896 to 1908. He is considered to be one of the first missiologists. David Bosch describes him as "the father of missiology as a theological discipline."
Life.
The oldest son of a master needlemaker, Warneck went from the family needleshop to study at the Francke Foundation and then studied with the theological faculty at Halle University beginning in 1855. During his studies he became a member of Hallenser Wingolf, a Christian non-denominational student association. After graduation he served as a private tutor and became an assistant pastor in Dommitzsch, Germany. In 1871 he was appointed as theological teacher for the Rhenish Mission Society in Barmen. Due to illness, however, in 1874 he moved to the parish office in Rothenschirmbach near Eisleben.
In 1874 Warneck founded the Allgemeine Missions-Zeitschrift, which he published in conjunction with Reinhold Grundemann. In 1879 he founded the Saxon Provincial Mission Conference. In 1896 he was appointed Professor of the Science of Mission (missiology) in the University of Halle which was the first time missiology was an academic discipline at a German university.
He was buried in the north cemetery in Halle an der Saale and wished for the words on his tombstone, "Let my grace be enough for you, because my strength is mighty in the weak."

Tupanvirus

Tupanvirus is a genus of viruses first described in 2018. The genus is composed of two species of virus that are in the giant virus group. Researchers discovered the first isolate in 2012 from deep water sediment samples taken at 3000m depth off the coast of Brazil. The second isolate was collected from a soda lake in Southern Nhecolândia, Brazil in 2014. They are named after Tupã (Tupan), a Guaraní thunder god, and the places they were found. These are the first viruses reported to possess genes for amino-acyl tRNA synthetases for all 20 standard amino acids.
Classification.
The genus Tupanvirus was first described in 2018 with the discovery of the two isolates of tupanviruses found in soda lake and deep oceanic sediments samples collected in Brazil. The genus is currently unassigned but hypothesized to be a member of the family "Mimiviridae", along with the other amoeba-infecting viruses. Members of the family "Mimiviridae" includes "Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus" (APMV) that is known for its large size of ~500 nm in diameter. In contrast, the typical virus size range is approximately 20-200 nm. Mimiviruses also possess fibril structures on the capsid as well as genes encoding proteins for nucleotide synthesis and various metabolisms that are not found in other viruses.
Unlike the other mimiviruses in the "Mimiviridae", tupanvirus has a ~550 nm long cylindrical tail covered with fibrils that is attached to the base of the capsid. This morphological feature makes tupanvirus the largest described virus (approximately ~ 1.2 μm in length with the tail) with the longest tail ever observed a in virus. Tupanviruses are also capable of infecting a wider range of amoebae than other mimiviruses, and produce a cytotoxic effect in host and non-host organisms that is not observed in APMV. In addition, phylogenomic results revealed that the genus Tupanvirus is separate from the other viruses in the family "Mimiviridae".
Morphology.
The morphology of Tupanvirus can be similarly compared to that of other ‘amoeba-infecting mimiviruses’. This is because of similarities between the capsid of Tupanvirus and that of other amoebae-infecting mimiviruses. The capsid of Tupanvirus measures approximately 450 nm. One major difference is that the Tupanvirus virion presents a large cylindrical tail (~550 nm × 450 nm diameter) attached to the base of the capsid. Both the capsid and cylindrical tail are covered in fibrils. Tupanvirus can measure up to 1.2 um in length, and some particles can reach up to 2.3 μm because of the “high degree of plasticity in the size of the tail”. Also to note is a lipid membrane is seen within the capsid. Additionally, their capsid is described as having a ‘stargate structure’. This star-shaped vertex is present in other mimivurises, and acts as a seal for the apex of the capsid. It has also been stated that the tail of Tupanvirus is less electron dense than the capsid.
Genome.
The genome contains roughly 1.5 million base pairs of double-stranded DNA, coding for 1276–1425 predicted proteins, making it the fourth largest among viral genomes. While 30% of the genes are new and not found in other viruses, genomic analysis shows most of the known genes can be related to amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, with the rest corresponding to eukaryotes and bacteria. The shared genes of tupanvirus with different lineages of amoeba-infecting mimiviruses indicate it as a separate genus within family Mimiviridae. For example, its A/T rich genome resembles that of other amoebal mimiviruses and suggests a preference for codons formed by A/T-rich sequences. As well, the frequent occurrence of the “AAAATTGA” promoter motif is also similar to that of other mimiviruses.
As a giant virus, tupanvirus presents the largest translational apparatus within the known virosphere, carrying 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and 70 transfer RNAs (tRNA), while the rest are involved in RNA maturation and splicing, as well as ribosomal protein modification. Moreover, tupanviruses contain a number of DNA-independent RNA synthesizing polymerases and enzymes as well as transcription factors that are involved in viral transcription. Furthermore, many genes that encode for processes found in cellular organisms are also found in the Tupanvirus genome, which contains a richer gene set than some bacteria and archaea, and even some eukaryotes. As a result, the analysis of tupanviruses constitutes a new step towards understanding the evolution of giant viruses, because such diverse and complete gene sets not only surpass that of other viral genomes, but also rival that of bacteria and even eukaryotes. In fact, tupanvirus is the only known virus to host all 20 aaRS, exceeding other giant viruses like Klosneuvirus; yet, there is no agreement on whether these genes are host-derived or passed down from an ancestral mimivirus. One such extraordinary example are two copies of an 18 S rRNA intronic region that are highly expressed during viral replication. Although these intronic regions also exist in other mimiviruses, the tupanvirus 18S rRNA is phylogenetically different with their function still unknown.
Host.
Tupanviruses have the ability to infect a wider range of hosts than other giant viruses, including many amoebae of the genus Acanthameoba (as well as members of the species Vermamoeba vermiformis, Dictyostelium discoideum and Willartia magna), and may also infect other protists. There are no documented threats to humans. The tupanvirus’ generalist approach may be attributed to the low species richness and abundance of the virus’ habitat.
Tupanvirus-infected amoebas also present a new virus-host interaction not previously observed among other amoebae. Infected cells were found to aggregate with non-infected cells, a mechanism suggested to be mediated by mannose binding protein gene expression (MBP). The clusters of affected cells were shown to increase viral dissemination within the host, thus increasing virulence of the virus. The generalist approach, in conjunction with aggregation behaviour, decreases the dilution effect and increases host-encounter rates.
Life cycle and host interaction.
Attachment.
Viral particles attach directly to the host cell surface. The attachment process occurs very rapidly. Virions can be visibly attached at 0 hours past infection. The specific mechanism is still unknown.
Entry.
Virions enter via phagocytosis. Generally only one particle will be present in each phagosome, although several particles may enter the intracellular matrix in different phagosomes at the same time. This Tupanvirus uses membrane fusion in order to release its genome. The viral capsid contains a lipid membrane that facilitates fusion with the phagosome membrane to release the viral genome. The virus also releases the contents kept in the tail after an invagination of the phagosome between the two tail components results in fusion.
Replication.
The viral genome is released from the phagosome into the amoeba’s cytoplasm. This virus facilitates aggregation of amoeba hosts in order to replicate rapidly and have a supply of hosts for progeny particles. Bunch formation happens rapidly after infection and will continue as long as host cells are living. Bunches can re-form after mechanical separation as long as host cells are living. Replication factories are formed as early as 8 h.p.i. up to 12 h.p.i.
Assembly.
Initially, when replication factories are still immature, new virions are assembled as soon as possible. Therefore, many particles at various stages of assembly may be present inside a single factory. Once the factory has matured capsid assembly is finished and the genome is incorporated. The tails are attached to the capsid following genome incorporation. Assembly of particles happens on a loose timeline, resulting in particles at varying stages of assembly at the time of release.
Release.
Viral particles are released, facilitated by cell lysis. When infecting the amoeba in the species "Vermamoeba vermiformis" many assembled particles are not functional at the time of release. As many as half of released particles are not infectious; this phenomenon is also present when infecting host amoeba "Acanthamoeba castellanii". Although more research is required it is hypothesized that the production of non-infectious particles may be a normal part of the replication cycle.

Oman–Syria relations

Oman–Syria relations refer to the relationship between the Sultanate of Oman and the Syrian Arab Republic. Oman has an embassy in Damascus; while Syria has an embassy in Muscat. Both are members of the Arab League (Syria was temporarily suspended in 2012), and despite the ongoing civil war occurring in Syria, Oman has not closed its embassy in Syria and both countries maintain diplomatic relations, in sharp contrast to other Arab states of the Persian Gulf who have cut off diplomatic ties with Syria and closed their embassies.
Syrian civil war.
Following the outbreak of the currently ongoing Syrian civil war, gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain were quick to declare their support for the Syrian opposition against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, setting out to isolate the Syrian government by cutting off diplomatic ties, closing down their embassies, expelling Syria from the Arab League and imposing heavy economic sanctions. A notable exception in the policies of the gulf states was Oman, who not only refused to close down their embassies and cut off diplomatic ties, but also refused to support the Syrian opposition, with Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah stating that Oman's role in the conflict would strictly be constrained to humanitarian assistance in sharp contrast with Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
In August 2015, Oman invited Syrian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Walid Muallem to Muscat to meet with his Omani counterpart, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah. In October of that same year, Omani Foreign Minister traveled to Damascus, meeting with the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad himself to discuss Syria's ongoing civil war and defeating terrorism while assuring Oman's commitment to Syrian unity and sovereignty, with foreign minister Alawi saying that Oman "continues to exert every possible effort to help find a solution that would end the crisis in Syria,".
In July 2019, Oman's foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and foreign minister Walid Muallem on 7 July. Following the closed-door meeting, the Omani foreign ministry reported that Alawi had delivered a greeting from the Sultan of Oman to the Syrian President and talked about boosting efforts to "restore stability and security in the region”, as well as strengthening the Omani-Syrian relations.
On 5 October, Oman became the first Persian Gulf country to reinstate its ambassador in Syria.

Groove Approved

Groove Approved is the fourth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was originally released in 1989, on the Chrysalis label.
While his previous album featured members of Mike + The Mechanics, for this album Carrack worked mainly with producer T-Bone Wolk. The album's only hit was "I Live by the Groove", which was co-written by Carrack and Eddie Schwartz, and which peaked at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Schwartz co-produced the track with Wolk and Carrack; the rest of the album was produced by Wolk and Carrack working as a duo.
The song "Battlefield" was later covered by co-writer Nick Lowe under the title "I Live On A Battlefield". Carrack himself would use this longer title when he re-recorded the song in 2007 on his album "Old, New, Borrowed And Blue", and again on his 2010 album "A Different Hat" (backed by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra). The song, "I Live By the Groove" was featured in a montage scene in the 1989 cult film, The Wizard.
Reception.
AllMusic's William Ruhlmann calls "Groove Approved" "a solid, workman-like collection", and writes that its limited commercial success "had less to do with the album's real commercial potential than with upheavals in the record company".
Jim Green of "Trouser Press" praised the album for its "good old-fashioned R&amp;B grooves, often garnished with Carrack's tasty Hammond organ licks." However, Green also notes that "unfortunately, the synthetic drums sometimes slicken or stiffen the rhythm too much," and that "the songs aren't unforgettable, but they're mostly painless".

Taxonomic history.
"Ameletus" was circumscribed by Rev. A. E. Eaton in 1885. His initial circumscription included three species, all of which were described in the same paper: the type species "A. dissitus", "A. subnotatus", and "A. exquisitus".
R. P. Longinus Navás circumscribed the genus "Chimura" in 1915. It only consisted of its type species, the newly described "C. aetherea". In 1960, Edmunds synonymized "Chimura" with "Ameletus".
"Paleoameletus" was circumscribed by J. A. Lestage in 1940; he created it for the species "A. primitivus" which J. R. Traver had described the previous year. George F. Edmunds, Jr., and Jay R. Traver synonymized "Paleoameletus" with "Ameletus" in 1954.

William H. Wynn

William H. "Bill" Wynn (1932 – February 21, 2002) was the first president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), and the last president of the Retail Clerks International Union (RCIU), after the latter merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1979, to create the UFCW. He is best known for playing a leading role in completing the above merger, and, through that effort, making a pivotal contribution to the creation of the largest union affiliated to the AFL-CIO at the time. Wynn is also credited for instituting a fierce organizing culture at UFCW.
Early life.
Bill Wynn came from a union family, with both of his parents, plus his uncle and brother-in-law, active in the United Auto Workers.
Wynn became a union member himself in 1948 when, at the age of 15, he started working at The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, or A&amp;P, superstore in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana.
Retail Clerks activism and career.
Wynn was elected the full-time union representative for RCIU Local 37 in 1954, and in 1961 he was hired by the international to serve as an organizer for the RCIU Indiana District Council, and later became assistant director of the Northwestern Division.
Wynn was mentored by RCIU international representative James Housewright, who eventually became the international president, and who in 1969 called Wynn to the union's international headquarters in Washington to serve as assistant to the international director of organizing. Within the same year, Wynn was further promoted to administrative assistant to the international president, and two years later, he was made organizing director of the central division.
In 1971, Wynn was elected an international vice-president of the RCIU, and in 1976, he became the union's international secretary treasurer.
Following the untimely death of Housewright in 1977, Wynn was elected RCIU international president.
Wynn advanced the work started by Housewright regarding a merger effort with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters. Under Wynn's leadership, the merger was completed in 1979, and the UFCW was created, becoming the AFL-CIO's largest affiliated union.
UFCW presidency.
Wynn was the unanimous choice to lead the new union by delegates to the UFCW's founding convention in Montreal in 1979.
Through Wynn's leadership the UFCW grew significantly – via new member organizing and mergers with other unions – and pioneered the use of television advertising as a tactic and medium for comprehensive campaign approaches.
A vice-president of the AFL-CIO, Wynn chaired the labor federation's Organizing Committee, and served on the executive board of the A. Philip Randolph Institute.
Political involvement.
Wynn marshalled the UFCW behind Democratic candidates for president, and served on the committee to elect Jimmy Carter in 1979.
He also led the UFCW's effort on behalf of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro during the 1984 presidential campaign, becoming one of the first union leaders to encourage and support Ferraro's bid to be the first female vice-president of the United States.
Death.
Bill Wynn died in Naples, Florida in 2002 of a heart attack.

Tenri Seminary

Tenri Seminary (天理教校 "Tenrikyōkō") is the seminary of the Japanese new religion Tenrikyo, located in Tenri, Japan.
History.
In April 1900, Tenri Seminary was established to train and educate Tenrikyo followers in ministry. Initially, the seminary was a four-year course offering coursework at the middle school level along with coursework on Tenrikyo doctrine and rituals. Since its establishment, Tenri Seminary has gone through a number of reorganizations.
In 1908, the seminary was reorganized into the six-month Special Course (別科 "Bekka") while Tenri Middle School continued as a separate organization. In 1938, the two-year Graduate Seminary program was established and two new courses were added – the Preparatory program which would educate graduates of Tenri Middle School and Tenri Girls School, and the Asian program which would train ministers for mission work in Asia.
In April 1941, the seminary underwent another reorganization. The most notable change was that the Special Course, which had trained 128,000 ministers over 65 sessions, was discontinued and replaced by the shorter, three-month Spiritual Development Course (修養科 "Shūyōka"). From that year onward, five programs were offered – Graduate, Junior, Preparatory, Asian, and Spiritual Development. Eventually the Preparatory and Asian Courses were discontinued and the Spiritual Development Course became a separate organization supervised directly by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.
In April 1977, the five-year Daini Junior Seminary (第二専修科 "Daini Senshūka") program was established but was eventually discontinued.
Programs.
As of 2018, Tenri Seminary offers three two-year programs – Junior Seminary (専修科 "Senshūka"), Graduate Practical Training Program (本科実践課程 "Honka jissen katei"), and Graduate Research Program (本科研究課程 "Honka kenkyū katei").
The Junior Seminary is open to Tenrikyo adherents who have completed high school and enrolls approximately 150 students each year. Students take coursework on Tenrikyo scriptures, rituals, and history in the morning and perform various duties at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters in the afternoon.
The Graduate Practical Training Program combines academic study (of Tenrikyo theology, Tenrikyo history, other major religions) with pastoral work (door-to-door missionary work and church management). This program is open to Tenrikyo adherents who have graduated from the Junior Seminary or a four-year college and enrolls approximately 30 students each year.
The Graduate Research Program focuses on the academic study of religion and of Tenrikyo theology. During the program, each student works on and completes a thesis pertaining to Tenrikyo theology. On a regular basis, Tenri Seminary publishes the "Tenrikyōkō Ronsō" (天理教校論叢), a collection of papers written by lecturers and students of the Graduate Research Program. This program is open to Tenrikyo adherents who have graduated from a four-year college and enrolls several students a year.

Chief Management Officer of the Department of Defense

The chief management officer (CMO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) was the third-in-command of the department after the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense. The position's purpose was to reduce costs by improving the quality and productivity of DoD's business operations. Congress disestablished the CMO position with the passage of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 effective 1 January 2021.
Organization.
The CMO's office contained six "reform leaders" in the areas of logistics and supply chains, real property, community services, human resources, and health care, and a Program Executive Officer for IT Business Systems. The office also oversaw Washington Headquarters Services and Pentagon Force Protection Agency, and contained an Oversight and Compliance Directorate, and a Headquarters Support Directorate.
History.
In 2005, the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommended that DoD create a CMO position to avoid fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in its reform program. However, DoD declined to create an independent CMO position, and instead assigned CMO responsibilities to the Deputy Secretary of Defense in September 2007. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 codified this into law, and created a Deputy CMO subordinate to the Deputy Secretary. In 2011, the functions of the Business Transformation Agency were transferred to the Deputy CMO when that agency was disestablished.
Creation of the CMO position was mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, and became effective on 1 February 2018. The Deputy CMO position was replaced with the new CMO position. While the Deputy CMO was an internal advisor to the Deputy Secretary, the CMO is more powerful. The CMO was third-in-command of DoD, thus outranking the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and had authority to order the three officeholders to implement reforms.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was signed into law on 12 December 2017, assigned CMO responsibility for “providing the availability of common, usable, departmentwide data sets and transparency of enterprise data.”
Section 921 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which was signed into law on 13 August 2018, required CMO to provide to Congress: 1) a plan, schedule, and cost estimate for conducting reforms within the enterprise business operations of the DoD by February 2019; and 2) a certification that the DoD achieved a 25 percent savings in fiscal year 2020 against the total amount obligated and expended in fiscal year 2019 for four covered activities (civilian resources management, logistics management, services contracting, and real estate management) by January 2020. CMO provided the plan, schedule, and cost estimate in April 2019 but alerted Congress in October 2019 that it would not meet the 25 percent savings targets in all of the four covered activities in FY 2020 against the FY 2019 baseline, and instead forecasted an average 5 percent cost reduction for the four covered activities in the Fourth Estate.
In January 2020, CMO provided its final Section 921 report to Congress, citing a total of $37 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021 across three separate reform efforts: (1) department-wide business reform savings, (2) savings claimed from the FY 2021 Defense-Wide Review, and (3) savings reported in response to section 921 ($1.2 billion). In November 2020, the Government Accountability Office reported to Congress that CMO’s cost savings estimates were not consistently well documented and did not always reflect its definitions of reform.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Pub. L. 116-92) required the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) to conduct an independent assessment of the CMO. The SecDef selected the Defense Business Board (DBB) on 3 February 2020 to conduct the independent assessment. The DBB submitted its report titled "The Chief Management Officer of the Department of Defense: An Assessment" to the SecDef on 1 June 2020. The report stated that since its establishment, the Office of the CMO "has failed to deliver the level of department-wide business transformation envisioned in the legislation, nor met the expectations of multiple SecDef, Deputy Secretary of Defense (DepSecDef), other senior officials or the Congressional defense leadership." Citing several more reasons, the DBB report concluded that "the OCMO has not delivered the needed transformation to the Department" and that the position was "mostly ineffective."
In June/July 2020, both the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee put language in their versions of the FY 2021 NDAA to abolish the CMO. In December 2020, responding to language in the proposed FY 2021 NDAA conference report, Lisa Hershman stated “Congress has given no justification for eliminating the CMO… I’ve never been asked by either the House or the Senate, any subcommittee to make any kind of testimony on the facts. They need to answer to this.” Congress abolished the CMO position with the passage of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 effective 1 January 2021. On 11 January 2021, DepSecDef David Norquist realigned CMO functions and responsibilities to the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Chief Information Officer, and the Defense Business Council. He also directed the re-establishment of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD(IO)) and the Director of Administration and Management (DA&amp;M).

1P-ETH-LAD (1-propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethyamide) is an analog of LSD. 1P-ETH-LAD is a psychedelic drug similar to LSD. Research has shown formation of ETH-LAD from 1P-ETH-LAD incubated in human serum, suggesting that it functions as a prodrug. It is part of the lysergamide chemical class. Like ETH-LAD, this drug has been reported to be significantly more potent than LSD itself, and is reported to largely mimic ETH-LAD's psychedelic effects.
1P-ETH-LAD has little history of human usage before January 2016.

Monozukuri

Monozukuri, or alternatively spelled Monodzukuri, literally means 'production' or 'making of things' in Japanese and is the Japanese term for 'manufacturing'. The broader meaning encompasses a synthesis of technological prowess, know-how and spirit of Japan's manufacturing practices. The spirit includes a sincere attitude towards production with pride, skill and dedication and the pursuit of innovation and perfection. It is currently a buzzword in Japan and many Japanese people believe that monozukuri has led Japan to a dominant position in the world market.
Overview.
The Japanese word is a combination of 'mono' meaning thing and 'zukuri' meaning the act of making. It simply means craftsmanship or manufacturing and has come to be used as a buzzword in industry and mass media to embody the Japanese spirit and history of manufacturing. It is a word of Japanese origin and has only recently, since the latter half of the 1990s, come to mean manufacturing and production. Its usage was popularized after the promulgation of the Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology on March 19, 1999.
Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology.
The Basic Act on the Promotion of Core Manufacturing Technology Act No. 2 was established on March 19, 1999, to support the development of the manufacturing industry. Due to changes in employment structure, industrialization overseas, and changes in the economy, the share of the manufacturing industry in Japan's GDP fell in the 1990s.

<doc id="56708897" url="?curid=56708897" title="Cello Sonata No. 4 (Ries)">
Cello Sonata No. 4 (Ries)

Ferdinand Ries's Cello Sonata in G minor, Op. 125 was composed in London in 1823, but was not published until 1825 by T. Boosey &amp; Co. It is one of the last two instrumental sonatas published by the composer before his death in 1838.
Composition history.
Little is known of the precise circumstances under which the sonata was composed until Ries offered it to T. Boosey &amp; Co, along with several other works in August 1823. Only the sonata, the composers Piano Octet, Op. 128 along with a piano fantasia on a theme from von Weber's Der Freischütz were accepted with only the sonata and the fantasia making it to publication in 1825.
When published, the sonata included an alternate violin part to the cello part, this leads Bert Hagels to comment that the work was probably not composed with a concert performance in mind, but rather was intended for sale on the British amateur/private music market for private performance. As published the sonata was dedicated to Sir Herbert Taylor at that time serving as Military Secretary to the British Army, presumably as a means of increasing sales. Cole Tutino notes that the composers manuscript bears a different dedication to a "Madamme de Montagny", and speculates that she may have been the intended recipient of the manuscript which currently resides in the Bavarian State Library.
Structure.
The sonata is structured in three movements:
Bert Hagels in his comments that the opening movement of the sonata has some structural (but not musical) influences from Beethoven's, Op. 5, No. 2 Cello Sonata, Tutino agrees, speculating that may have been due to the fact that Ries had once arranged Beethoven's sonata for string quintet. Unlike the flute sonatas the composer wrote in England, this work is scored for two performers of approximately equal skill level and like the other cello sonatas he composed is a true duo, rather than a piano sonata with cello accompaniment. Tutino concurs with this assessment, pointing out that both players would require fairly advanced skills in their respective instruments to successfully perform the sonata. Martin Rummel in the notes to the Naxos recording of the sonata broadly agrees with the previous authors, singling out the concluding rondo as showcasing both players abilities, he also noted structural similarities to Beethoven's Op. 69 Cello Sonata and suggests that while the Opp. 20 &amp; 21 Cello Sonata's were intended for Bernhard Romberg, this sonata was aimed at a playing style similar to that attributed to Jean-Pierre Duport the cellist for whom Beethoven composed his first cello sonatas.

Antonia Albert

Antonia Albert (born ) is an Austrian business economist and entrepreneur. In 2015, she co-founded the startup Careship in Berlin, Germany as an online marketplace for in-home senior care. Albert helped raise $4 million in investor funding in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. Careship has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.
Careship.
When Albert's grandmother became sick in 2014, her family had great difficulty finding a suitable caregiver. In response, she co-founded the startup Careship with her brother Nikolaus Albert to create a virtual marketplace for in-home senior care. Careship uses an online “matchmaking algorithm” to connect families needing senior care with qualified self-employed caregivers. Caregivers can help with common tasks such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. On the platform, caregivers set their own price and Careship handles billing and coordinating insurance payments.
Albert and her brother raised $4 million in investor funding for Careship in 2017, and an additional $6 million in 2018. The marketplace was initially only offered in Berlin but has expanded to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the cities of Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. They would like to expand into Austria in 2018.
The business model used by Careship and similar services is controversial. Product testing organization Stiftung Warentest examined cleaning services in October 2014 and came to the conclusion that the service matched the online promise only in four out of ten cases.
Biography.
Albert is from Vienna, Austria. She studied business administration in the Netherlands and Switzerland, receiving a BSc in International Business Administration in 2012 and a MSc in Strategic Management in 2013. Before co-founding Careship with her brother, she worked as a business economist for internet holding company Rocket Internet. Antonia was voted one of the 100 most Inspiring Women 2015 by BBC and was included on the 2018 Forbes "30 Under 30" list.

The Letter (Wayne Newton song)

"The Letter" is a 1992 single by Wayne Newton from his album "Moods &amp; Moments". The song peaked at number one on "Cashbox"'s Top 100 Country Singles chart in July 1992 and took an additional five months to reach number one on Cashbox's Top 100 Pop Singles chart in December 1992. Although the song peaked at number one in "Cashbox", "The Letter" did not appear in any of "Billboard"'s charts and was not mentioned at all by "Billboard".
Background.
In a 1991 interview with Ralph Emery on Nashville Now, Newton revealed that "The Letter" was based on a discarded note written by Elvis Presley in 1976 during his final stay at the Las Vegas Hilton. Years after Presley's death, Newton bought Presley's note in June 1991 at a Sotheby's auction for $13,200. Newton wrote "The Letter" after receiving requests to provide copies of Presley's note to his fans. In the lyrics for "The Letter", Newton sings about Elvis's loneliness and includes a word for word reading of Elvis's note that he bought at Sotheby's.
Reception.
Cash Box said Newton transformed "The Letter" from a fan favorite to a religious awakening.
Chart performance.
On July 11, 1992, "The Letter" peaked at number one on the "Cashbox" Top 100 Country Singles chart. After remaining on the Cashbox Top 100 Pop Singles chart for almost six months, "The Letter" reached number one in December 12, 1992. Despite peaking at number one in Cashbox, "The Letter" did not chart on any Billboard chart, though it was reviewed by the magazine and did appear on Billboard's music-videos Clip List for a few months, as TNN (The Nashville Network) listed it among its rotation of videos.
Music video.
In 1992, Newton released a music video for "The Letter". In the music video, Newton performs at The Hilton and reads out Elvis's note.

There was never much humour with the MJQ but there is plenty of musical fun with Rollins. Yes, the CD is a mish-mash but if you don’t have the Rollins tracks they are well worth acquiring. I am sure the Teddy Edwards’ groupies will be pleased with the final two tracks."

Alberto Laiseca

Alberto Jesús Laiseca (February 11, 1941 - December 22, 2016) was an Argentine author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantastic literature. He also worked as a TV host and narrator for horror-related projects. Laiseca is considered as one of the most respected and noteworthy writers of his generation.
Biography.
Laiseca was born in Rosario, however, shortly after his birth his family relocated first to Unquillo and later to Camilo Aldao, in the south of Cordoba Province where he lived as a young man until he moved to Santa Fe to pursue a college education. In 1964 he dropped out and went to work as a migrant agricultural worker during the harvests in Mendoza, and in other argentine provinces. Laiseca had a difficult relationship with his father a prominent medical doctor in Camilo Aldao. Laiseca was a chain-smoker. 
He is one of the most respected writers of his generation. He published 13 novels and numerous short stories, as well as several essays and non-fiction books. He also published a book of brief poems based on Classical Chinese poetry, "Poemas chinos" ("Chinese Poetry", 1987). Most of his short stories have been collected in book collections. His monumental novel "Los sorias" (1998) -which had remained unpublished for twenty years after its completion- is currently considered, due to its extension, as the longest novel in Argentine literature.
He achieved further popularity after appearing as the TV host for the anthology series "Cuentos de terror" (Horror Stories), for the Argentine cable television channel I.Sat. The show consisted of Laiseca narrating -with his own style and words- classical or well-known horror short stories against an empty and dark backdrop, including some of Laiseca's own short stories, such as the famous "La cabeza de mi padre" ("The Head of My Father"). He later served in a similar capacity as host of the television program "Cine de terror" (Horror Cinema), for Latin American cable television network with classic programming Retro.

Shadow Cabinet of Simon Bridges

The Shadow Cabinet of Simon Bridges formed the official Opposition in the 52nd New Zealand Parliament. It comprised all members of the New Zealand National Party, which was the largest party not a member of the Government.
The Shadow Cabinet was established on 11 March 2018, two weeks after Simon Bridges' election as Leader of the Opposition. The portfolio allocations were amended six times as a number of National MPs either resigned during the term of Parliament or announced their intention not to contest the 2020 general election.
Following Bridges' defeat by Todd Muller in the May 2020 National Party leadership election and the formation of Muller's Shadow Cabinet, the Bridges Shadow Cabinet ceased to exist.
Formation.
Commentators noticed that the initial portfolio allocations and caucus rankings rewarded Bridges' rivals for the leadership. Former Justice Minister Amy Adams, who had placed second in the leadership election, was named Finance Spokesperson and was ranked third. Judith Collins, who finished third, was placed at fourth rank, and received the housing portfolio, which she had asked for. Previous aspirants to the leadership, Jonathan Coleman and Mark Mitchell were also ranked highly, in sixth and seventh position respectively. Bridges' allies Todd McClay and Jami-Lee Ross were placed fifth and eighth respectively. Ross was the highest-ranked National MP who did not serve as a minister in the Fifth National Government. Along with Bridges and deputy leader Paula Bennett, the front bench was completed by economic and regional development spokesperson Paul Goldsmith and education spokesperson Nikki Kaye. Melissa Lee and Sarah Dowie were the other two non-ministers to gain promotion to the top twenty.
Bridges had promised "generational change" on his ascension to the leadership. The front bench line up in particular was praised for including a high proportion of women MPs. Bridges and Bennett were, notably, the first National leadership team both to be of Māori descent. Bridges also placed several former ministers in lower positions than they had held under Bridges' predecessor, Bill English. Former senior minister Gerry Brownlee lost the foreign affairs portfolio to McClay, while former Finance Minister Steven Joyce resigned from Parliament when he was not offered the finance portfolio. Former Conservation Minister Maggie Barry (who had openly supported Amy Adams' leadership bid) and Customs Minister Nicky Wagner were also demoted. The twelve new MPs elected in the 2017 general election were listed last, alphabetically by surname. Whanau Ora spokesperson Jo Hayes was the lowest ranked returning MP.
Amendments.
Portfolio allocations were amended six times throughout Bridges' tenure as leader to accommodate the departures or planned retirements of members. The first change was made two weeks after the formation of the Shadow Cabinet, on 26 March, with the resignation of Jonathan Coleman. Coleman had been the spokesperson for health and sport and recreation, portfolios he had held ministerial warrants for in the previous government. Michael Woodhouse, a former hospital chief executive, gained health. Education spokesperson Nikki Kaye picked up sport and recreation. Woodhouse's portfolio of workplace relations and safety was added to the responsibilities of environment spokesperson Scott Simpson.
In October 2018, a series of events that involved the leaking of Bridges' travel expenses saw transport and infrastructure spokesperson Jami-Lee Ross stand down from his portfolios while undertaking personal leave (ostensibly for "deeply personal" health issues, although Ross would later claim that this was a false statement put out by Bridges and Bennett) before resigning from the National Party. Judith Collins and Paul Goldsmith picked up Ross's portfolios. The third resignation, in January 2019, was of former Attorney-General Chris Finlayson. His shadow Attorney General portfolio went to Amy Adams and a new drug reform portfolio, responding to the Government's decision to hold a referendum on legalising the sale, use, possession and production of cannabis in 2020, was assigned to Paula Bennett.
In June 2019, Adams and Wairarapa MP Alastair Scott announced they would not seek re-election to Parliament at the 2020 general election. Along with the retirement of list MP and Māori development spokesperson Nuk Korako in mid-May, this triggered a broad reshuffle. Paul Goldsmith received Adams' finance portfolio and became the third-ranked MP. Goldsmith's economic and regional development portfolios were split between Todd McClay and Chris Bishop, who was promoted to the second bench and also gained the transport portfolio. Jo Hayes was promoted to be spokesperson for Māori development and Treaty of Waitangi negotiations, but retained a low ranking. Tim Macindoe became Shadow Attorney-General and Gerry Brownlee returned as foreign affairs spokesperson.
Agriculture spokesperson Nathan Guy announced his intention to retire at the next election in July 2019. He was replaced by Bridges' eventual successor to the leadership, Todd Muller, whose climate change portfolio was passed to Simpson. The sixth and final reshuffle, in February 2020, featured minor redistributions of portfolios following announcements that Maggie Barry (on 5 November 2019), Nicky Wagner, Sarah Dowie and David Carter (all on 11 February 2020, although Carter had previously indicated his intentions on 17 October 2018) would retire at the next election.
List of spokespersons.
At the point of its disestablishment, the Bridges Shadow Cabinet consisted of the following spokespersons.

Taonius belone

Taonius belone is a glass squid belonging to the genus "Taonius" from the family Cranchiidae. It occurs in the northern subtropical and in the tropical or equatorial waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
Description.
"Taonius belone" is a large species of glass squid, which reaches a mantle length of up to 660 mm, the mantle being rather leathery in texture. It has short arms which have narrow protective membranes which widen near the arm bases where they join up to create an internal umbrella. Each arm has two rows of suckers which become denser towards the tips; there are at least 21 pairs of suckers on each arm, with the largest suckers around the 8th pair. The largest suckers each have 20–30, wide, tightly set teeth that cover entire margin of the ring; the smaller distal suckers have only 6-8 teeth while the suckers located near the arm bases have teeth which are merged and present a smooth surface except for few distal undulations. On the tentacular club the largest two suckers are in the middle two rows of the club manus and these have one or two enlarged, hook-like teeth with no other teeth present; the other enlarged suckers in the middle rows of the club have two large hook-like teeth which were nearly equal in size with 4-5 smaller secondary teeth. The suckers in the lateral rows of the manus are laterally compressed, each sucker bearing two long, curved teeth on distal and pointed teeth on the lateral margin of the sucker ring. The tentacular stalk has two rows of locking suckers on distal two-thirds to three-quarters on the stalk with an indistinct carpal cluster at base of manus. The mantle has a smooth skin and where it meets the funnel there are no tubercules. It has elongated, lanceolate fins which have a length equivalent 44% of the mantle length and at their anterior ends they are widely separated. The gladius protrudes out between the posterior ends of the fins to form a tail.
Distribution.
"Taonius belone" was originally collected in the Indian Ocean at 10°8'S, 97°14'E. SInce the type specimen was collected and described this species has been recorded off southern Japan, in the Philippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and throughout the central equatorial Pacific. Its known distribution suggests that it is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, but actual records are few and far between.
Habitat and biology.
"Taonius belone" is a large pelagic and oceanic squid, referred to as mesopelagic. It has planktonic paralarvae and the eye of this species changes during ontogenetic development. In waters off Hawaii, "T. belone" undertakes a downward vertical migration as it matures. The paralarvae have laterally compressed eyes at the ends of stalks and they can be found in the upper 400 m of the water column, while the larger juveniles occur at depths between , and the subadults which have hemispherical, stalkless eyes inhabit depths below 700 m.
Taxonomy.
"Taonius belone" was originally described as the nominate subspecies of a species then known as "T. borealis", i.e. "T. b. borealis". The other was "T. b. pacifica". Both these taxa were considered to be members of the genus "Belonella" but this is now considered to be synonymous with "Taonius". They are now thought of as sister species with "T.belone" in the tropical Indo-Pacific and "T. borealis" in the North Pacific.

Strathbrock Castle

Strathblock Castle, Uphall, West Lothian, Scotland, was a motte-and-bailey castle. The castle was the caput of the barony of Strathbrock. The lands were given to Freskyn, a Flemish nobleman, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. The castle passed by marriage to the le Chen family. By 1435, the castle was in the hands of the Douglas family, and in 1524 the rector of Strathbrock Church lived there. The castle may have been a motte, with later stone buildings, and its remains were visible in the early 18th century. The area, to the south of Uphall's Main Street, is now built up.

Sony Xperia XZ2

The Sony Xperia XZ2 is an Android-based smartphone unveiled, manufactured, released and marketed by Sony. Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ2 Compact at a press conference held at the annual 2018 Mobile World Congress event on February 26, 2018. It features Qi Wireless Charging, Dynamic Vibration System, 4K HDR Video Recording and has the standard 3.5 mm Headphone Jack removed.
Hardware.
Design and Build.
The Xperia XZ2 comes with the new "Ambient Flow" design. It consists of a new 7000-series aluminum alloy chassis that has a curved edge all around the device, and 2.5D scratch-resistant front and arched back glass panels made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, resulting in a symmetric and curvier design aesthetic. The most defining change in the Xperia XZ2, as well as the Xperia XZ2 Premium and XZ2 Compact, is the placement of the camera on the back. It is now symmetrically arranged on the top-center of the device, as opposed to being placed on the top left side like on previous Xperia smartphones. The NFC antenna is placed along the Triple Image Sensing System, the MotionEye camera module and the now US-enabled fingerprint sensor, symmetrically aligned near the top-center axis of the device. The front houses the improved dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on the top bezel along with a 5 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and notification LED, and the other on the bottom bezel in an elongated slit along the edge of the glass and frame.
The Xperia XZ2's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . The device comes in 4 colors: Liquid Black, Liquid Silver, Deep Green and Ash Pink.
Display and Performance.
The Xperia XZ2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, built on a 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo 385 processors (4x 2.7 GHz and 4x 1.7 GHz), 4/6 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 630 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with 3x carrier aggregation, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design with a total of 8 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 400 GB in a hybrid SIM 2 slot setup.
Camera.
MotionEye.
Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. Known as the Sony IMX400, the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps, at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations.
The Xperia XZ2 borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZ1. It comprises a 19 MP 1/2.3” Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 μm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25 mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K HDR video recording, a world's first for Sony, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30 fps, a high-speed 1080p/60 fps and a 120 fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 5-megapixel sensor (1/5") with 23 mm, f/2.2 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization).
Triple Image Sensing technology.
The Xperia XZ2 has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR ("RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed") color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ2 also has "Predictive Capture". When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos.
3D Creator.
The Xperia XZ2 is also capable of capturing 3D objects without the need of a dual-camera setup, a feature that was first implemented into the Xperia XZ1. It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself.
Battery.
The Xperia XZ2 is powered by a non-removable 3180 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1 and Qi Wireless Charging. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan.
Battery Care.
The Xperia XZ2 also comes with Battery Care, Sony's proprietary charging algorithm that controls the charging process of the phone through machine learning. It recognizes the user's charging habits for a certain period and automatically adjusts itself to the pattern, for example an overnight charge, by stopping the initial charging to about 80-90 percent, and then continuing it until full from where it left off the next day. This effectively prevents the unnecessary damage to the battery's cells from excessive heat and current due to overcharging, further increasing the battery's life span.
Audio and Connectivity.
The Xperia XZ2 is the first Xperia device that has no standard 3.5 mm audio jack, which has resulted in a somehow mixed reaction from users and critics alike. To make up for the removal, the XZ2 has improved wireless audio connectivity along with Sony's famed LDAC, an audio coding technology they've developed in-house, which is now a part of the Android Open Source Project, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices.
Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy, NFC, 4x4 MIMO antennas for fast WI-Fi and cellular upload/download speeds, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, MirrorLink, screen casting via Miracast and Google Cast, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. The Xperia XZ2, like most new smartphone nowadays, has no FM radio.
Software.
The Sony Xperia XZ2 was launched with the Android 8.0 Oreo operating system, along with Smart Stamina battery saving modes and Sony's proprietary multimedia apps. On October 12, 2018, the latest Android 9.0 Pie started rolling out in OTA updates along with monthly security updates to users worldwide.

Ryan Graves (ice hockey)

Ryan Graves (born May 21, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). Graves was selected by the New York Rangers, 110th overall, in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He has previously played for the Colorado Avalanche.
Playing career.
Junior.
Graves, a native of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, first played at the major midget level with the South Shore Mustangs of the Nova Scotia Major Midget Hockey League (NSMMHL) as well as his local side, the Yarmouth Mariners in the Maritime Junior A Hockey League (MJAHL) in the 2010–11 season. With his growing frame, Graves was initially selected in the first round, ninth overall, in the 2011 QMJHL Entry Draft by the Prince Edward Island Rocket.
Agreeing to terms with the Rocket, Graves made his debut in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in the following 2011–12 season, registering 2 goals and 9 points in 62 contests. After improving his offensive output in the following 2012–13 season, Graves gained the eye of NHL scouts, and was later selected in the fourth round, 110th overall, by the New York Rangers in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft.
The Rocket were rebranded as the Charlottetown Islanders for the 2013–14 season. In collecting 12 points in 39 games, Graves was dealt by the Islanders to the Val-d'Or Foreurs for their post-season push. He helped the Foreurs in the playoffs with 8 points in 24 games to help the club claim the President's Cup. On March 17, 2014, Graves' progression was rewarded as he was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Rangers.
Prior to the 2014–15 season, Graves was again on the move in the QMJHL, traded by the Foreurs to the Quebec Remparts in exchange for Vincent Lanoue and draft picks on August 18, 2014. An assistant captain, Graves broke out offensively in his final junior season, contributing with a career-high 15 goals and 24 assists for 39 points in just 50 games. He was selected to the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup All-Star Team after collecting 5 points in 5 games for host club Quebec.
Professional.
In the 2015–16 season, Graves was assigned to the Rangers AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. He made his professional debut on opening night against the St. John's IceCaps on October 10, 2015. He collected his first goal and assist in a 4–3 victory over the Syracuse Crunch on October 23, 2015. As a hulking defenceman with good mobility, Graves was a staple on the blueline for the Wolf Pack and represented the club at the 2016 AHL All-Star Game, winning the hardest shot contest with a 103.4 m/ph slapshot. With the Wolf Pack finishing out of playoff contention, Graves finished the season, leading the blueline with 9 goals in his 21 points in 74 games.
In the following 2016–17 season, Graves continued his upward development in leading the blueline in all scoring categories with 8 goals, 22 assists and 30 points. Assigned to the Wolf Pack for the final year of his rookie contract, Graves regressed with just 4 goals and 11 points in 57 games in the 2017–18 season. Graves was dealt by the New York Rangers at the trade deadline to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Chris Bigras on February 26, 2018. He was immediately assigned to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage.
On July 17, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Avalanche. In the season, Graves scored his first NHL goal on January 4, 2019, against the team that drafted him, the New York Rangers. On July 8, Graves was re-signed to a one-year contract. During the 2019–20 season, primarily playing alongside eventual Calder Cup winner Cale Makar, Graves in a top-pairing role scored career highs in both goals and points, and lead the NHL in the plus–minus statistic at +40. On October 12, 2020, Graves signed a three-year, $9.5 million contract with the Avalanche.
In the pandemic delayed season, Graves made his 100th NHL appearance in a 3–2 overtime victory over the Anaheim Ducks on January 22, 2021. Used in a top-four role, Graves was relied upon as the mainstay of the Avalanche penalty kill, finishing third in the league in short-handed time on ice. He registered 2 goals and 15 points in appearing in 54 of 56 regular season games.
On July 15, 2021, due to impending expansion draft considerations, Graves was traded by Avalanche to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Mikhail Maltsev and a second-round pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.

1947 Héðinsfjörður air crash

On 29 May 1947, a Douglas DC-3 aircraft of Flugfélag Íslands crashed on on the west side of , a fjord in northern Iceland. All 25 people on board were killed. It is the deadliest air accident in Iceland.
Accident and recovery.
The aircraft was manufactured in 1944 as a Douglas C-47 Skytrain and later converted to DC-3 standard for civilian use. It was registered as TF-ISI to Flugfélag Íslands, now Air Iceland Connect, the domestic Icelandic airline. It left at 11.25AM on a scheduled one and a half hour flight from Reykjavík Airport to the former site of Akureyri Airport. It was heard over Skagafjörður and seen flying low over the water towards , the northernmost point between the Siglufjörður and Héðinsfjörður fjords on the northern coast, but failed to arrive. The weather was very foggy and searchers were unable to locate the wreckage until next morning, when it was spotted from one of three search aeroplanes on the side of Hestfjall, the mountain to the west of Héðinsfjörður. The DC-3 had disintegrated, slid down the mountainside, and caught fire. There were no survivors of the four crew and 21 passengers. The pilot was presumed to have been flying visually over the water, as was normal at the time since there were few navigational aids on the route, and to have become aware of the mountain only at the last moment. The accident is estimated to have happened at 12.48PM.
The bodies were taken by boat to Ólafsfjörður and from there, draped in the Icelandic flag, to Akureyri, where a dockside ceremony on their arrival on the evening of 30 May was attended by a crowd of about 4,000 people, and they were then transported to Akureyrarkirkja.
Legacy.
The accident is the deadliest air accident in Iceland and the second deadliest involving an Icelandic aircraft, after the crash of Icelandic Airlines Flight 001 in Sri Lanka in 1978. In 1997, fifty years after the accident, the Súlur Kiwanis Club of Ólafsfjörður erected a memorial below the crash site in the form of a two-metre Celtic cross. A book about the accident, "Harmleikur í Héðinsfirði" by Margrét Þóra Þórsdóttir, was published in 2009.

Wang Huizu

"This is a Chinese name, the family name is Wang."
Wang Huizu or Wang Hui-tsu (1731–1807) was a Chinese scholar-official, jurist, historian and moralist in Qing dynasty China. He was a commentator on social and local governance issues, and he was also an administrator who preached benevolence in judicial affairs.
Early life.
Wang Huizu was born on 21 January 1731 in Hsiao-Shan, in Zhejiang province, which is situated in the lower-Yangzi valley. This region was marked by the presence of Jiangnan, a city which was the center of Chinese literacy and an intellectually flourishing area. Wang Huizu's father, Wang K'ai, was the warden of a prison in Honan. Wang's mother was K'ai's concubine. Therefore, it could be said that Wang Huizu belonged to the local literati elite. However, Wang K'ai died in Canton in 1741, putting Wang and his mother into a precarious.situation. As a result, the young Wang was forced to struggle in poverty.
Life and career as an official.
In 1747, at the age of sixteen, Wang Huizu passed the local-level examination and therefore gained the status of "shengyuan" ("born official"). He taught at school in the wake of this success and got married in 1749. Thank to his new status, he became in 1752 the private secretary of Wang Tsung-min, his father-in-law who was a district-magistrate. Wang Huizu specialized into judicial affairs, which was the most lucrative choice for a private secretary. He continued to work as a secretary in judicial matters for thirty-four years, but served sixteen different officials in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
In 1768, Wang Huizu completed the Provincial-level exam which gave him the status of "Juren" ("recommended man") after having failed height times. After three avorted attempts, he finally passed the highest level of the Civil Service Examination in 1775, reaching the status of "Jinshi" ("presented scholar").
This new status allowed him to be appointed magistrate of the district of Ning-yüan in Hunan province in 1786. He was re-appointed magistrate in 1788 in the neighboring district of Hsin-t'ien, and re-appointed again in Daozhou in 1790, always in Hunan province. He was dismissed from his post in 1791 because of what he presents in his autobiography as an intrigue against him. In fact, Wang was asked by his superiors to examine four human skeletons in the county of Guiyang, but he didn't find the requisite medical examiner in the imparted time, which offered a reason to the provincial magistrate to struck off Wang Huizu from the public administration. Afterward, he remained for a moment in Changsha but finally retired in his home district in 1793 where he focused on his work as a scholar.
Wang Huizu became paralyzed in 1795 and died on the first of May 1807.
Scholarship.
The jurist.
Wang Huizu wrote two guides of public administration which had become paramount for Chinese officials until the end of the Qing empire. The first one, "Tso-shih yao-yen," was printed by Wang's friend, Pso T'ing Po, in 1785. The second, "Hsueh-chih i-shuo" ("Views on Learning Governance"), was published in 1793. In this second piece, Wang focused on county government and compared county magistrates to medicine men, wooden puppets or fragile glass screens: all these evocative comparisons reflect the officials' inability to manage an economically and demographically expanding society. Wang Huizu even stated in the preface of his book that he would make a critical study on the routine of Chinese local administrators. He expressed the idea that the scholar is much closer to the people than the administrator and that the official should rely on scholars if he wants to act efficiently, notably regarding the diffusion of Confucian moral values. He also underlined the importance of the hearing of people's plaints as one of the key for a good governance, notably because this activity creates a direct link between the magistrate and the civilians under his jurisdiction. In that respect, Wang Huizu thinks that magistrates should comment on plaints in public session rather than in private session in order to be heard by the community and to prevent the same trouble from coming back.
Wang's work has been very influential for all the Chinese officials after him, there is no denying that his guides have a significant moral dimension. For instance, Wang advocates a compassionate vision of justice. He notably gives the counter-example of a particularly strict magistrate named Zhang, who sentenced a cheater at the civil service examinations to be cangued publicly. the latter asked for his sentence to be adjourned because of the examinations. As the magistrate refused, the cheater's bride committed suicide, and when the young man was released, he committed suicide as well. Therefore, Wang concludes that sentences should be softened by the principle of human compassion (qing).
The historian.
Wang Huizu developed, throughout his life, a strong interest in history. His originality as an historian is that he understood the importance of practical devices, like indexes, as historical tools. His taste for history might have been originated by the "Han-shu" (history of former Han dynasty) he bought in 1769 in Beijing. Indeed, he certainly hadn't had the opportunity to become familiar with history before this time given his quite modest social origins. In the wake of this first purchase, Wang bought copies of all the twenty-four dynastic histories and compiled all the biographies encountered in these texts into an index in sixty-four volumes. This index called "Shih-hsing yün-pien" and published in 1783 became vital for the study of Chinese history during the Qing era. He also completed his most prominent piece by two other indexes called "Chiu-shih t'ung hsing-ming lüeh" and "Liao Chin Yuan san-sih t'ung hsing-ming lu" both dealing with homonyms found in the histories of the Chinese dynasties. They were respectively printed in 1790 and 1801.Between 1796 and 1800, Wang Huizu worked on "Yuan shih pên-chêng", a historical criticism of the history of the early Yuan dynasty.
Autobiography.
In 1795, Wang Huizu began to write his autobiography titled "Ping-t'a meng-hen lu" ("Traces of Dreams from a Sick Bed"). He first published it in 1796 but continued to enrich it regularly until 1806 and his sons even continued to fill it in after their father's death. This autogiography provides information on the life of the literati class in China but also on public administration, notably Wang's role as a magistrate. He advocates for mediation in the resolution of conflicts rather than lawsuits. If we take the example of formal adjudication, Wang Huizu tells us that when he was in Ning-yüan county in 1787, out of the two-hundred plaints he received each day, only ten usually led to a formal lawsuit. This shows that, in a majority of cases, arbitrage was used to ensure civil justice, this was a convenient mean to maintain social peace.
Although, many literati got involved into literature, notably into poetry, this was not the case of Wang Huizu. However, he was in contact with other Chinese scholars such as the historian Zhang Xuecheng and Zhu Yun, who originated the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" under the Qianlong emperor, Shao Chin-Han, Liu Chu-kao or the bibliophyle Pao T'ing-po.
The moralist.
Wang Huizu was also a moralist, he notably originated a handbook for the management of family-life called "Shuang jietang yongxun" ("Simple Precepts from the Hall enshrining a Pair of Chaste Widows"). Wang wrote that the two women who inspired his model of the virtuous, chaste wife were his mother and his father's second wife. The book was dedicated to educating his sons as future patriarchs. He underlines that the equilibrium of a family, especially the virtue of its women, depends on the "zunzhang yueshu" ("family elder's discipline").

Timothy J. Cunningham

Timothy Jerrell Cunningham (December 21, 1982 – 2018) was a Harvard-educated doctor with the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. As an epidemiologist, he was a team leader in the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and was named in 2017 as part of the Atlanta Business Chronicle's 40 Under 40 list. He also was the co-author of 28 publications on topics about sleep deprivation, pulmonary disease and more. Cunningham graduated from Morehouse and earned his S.M. and Sc.D. from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
On February 12, Cunningham left work early, complaining of not feeling well. His parents drove from Maryland to his house in Atlanta and found his phone, keys, wallet, car and his beloved dog, Mr. Bojangles. There was a $10,000 reward being offered by his family in partnership with Crime Stoppers Greater Atlanta.
Cunningham's remains were discovered Tuesday, April 3, 2018 in the Chattahoochee River in northwest Atlanta, police spokesman Carlos Campos said. According to Fulton County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jan Gorniak, the preliminary cause of death was drowning. A positive ID of the remains was made using dental records.
Disappearance.
On February 7, Cunningham resigned from a special USPHS deployment team tasked with deploying to areas in need by sending an email to Commander Richard Dunville.
“I thought he sounded exasperated,” Dunville told police. “In fact I would have encouraged him to stay on through June, when he would have received a service award, but he sounded too ready to leave.”
His supervisor Janet Croft told police that Cunningham left work quickly saying he felt ill on the morning of February 12, shortly after he learned he had been passed over for a promotion.
On the morning of February 12, 2018, Cunningham's mother received a text message from him at around 5:21 a.m. "Are you awake?" he asked. She did not respond, as her phone was in silent mode. "I wish I had that opportunity to answer that text," she said later. He tried calling again, at 9:12 a.m. that day, but didn't leave a message when she didn't answer.
A day before Cunningham disappeared he told his neighbor's husband that his wife should erase his cellphone number from her phone.
The search.
While police interviewed those closest to Cunningham, local parks and cemeteries were searched on foot, and a helicopter scanned the area. There was no sign of Cunningham until the first week of April, over a month since he first went missing.
Sgt. Cortez Stafford, a spokesman for the Atlanta Fire Department, said the department had previously searched the area of the river where the body was found on February 23. At that time, Stafford said, there was no sign of a body. "It could have been there or it could have moved there later. There's just no way to tell due to the rise and fall of the river," he said.
"It was very difficult terrain, very difficult to access the location of where Mr. Cunningham was found," Stafford said. "It was in a remote area that's not easily accessible by walking trails, by vehicle or by people just being around there."
Cunningham's parents had been told that a body had been found four times since Cunningham initially went missing. They felt "heart-wrenching agony" each time, they said, only to learn it wasn't their son.
"It takes you to a place that the light is not shining in," Terrell Cunningham said. "I won't call it a dark place, but they are lows. This is extremely hard."
On April 3, 2018, two fishermen notified police after they spotted a body buried in mud and tangled in debris on the banks of the Chattahoochee River. There were no signs of trauma on the body, such as cuts or bruises, despite its state of advanced decomposition consistent with having been submerged, according to Fulton County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jan Gorniak.
According to Maj. Michael O'Connor of the Atlanta Police Department, Cunningham was wearing his "favorite jogging shoes" when he was found, and three crystals were in his pocket. He was known to be a crystal enthusiast and avid jogger.
"We may never be able to tell you how he got into the river," O'Connor said.
An autopsy confirmed that Cunningham drowned. The death was later ruled a suicide by drowning after toxicology reports were completed.
Personal struggles.
Medical issues.
According to investigators, Cunningham's parents informed them that he was taking medication for a chronic disease, but did not provide details about the disease or when he was diagnosed.
Sexuality.
Cunningham's best friend, Nell Reed, who lives in Texas, told police that Cunningham had struggled with his sexuality, and had had a “breakdown” back in 2010.
“She said that Tim talked to her about his feelings toward men and that he didn’t consider himself gay,” the case file states. However, Cunningham told Reed that he had recently gotten back in touch with an old classmate from Morehouse College. “She said the person had been coming to Tim’s house and that Tim began to question whether the person was playing with his feelings,” police said. The classmate told investigators that he had subsequently blocked Cunningham's number.
“He said he didn’t want to be confrontational because they moved in the same social circles but it was obvious to him that Mr. Cunningham was making light advances,” police wrote in the investigative file.
On Feb. 9, Cunningham saw his former classmate on a date with a woman, and the two shook hands. Cunningham invited the man to go out for breakfast the next morning, but he declined.
Cunningham's sister stated, however, that she believed Cunningham was interested in two female coworkers.
Impact on family.
“I feel like I’m in a horrible ‘Black Mirror’ episode,” his sister, Tiara Cunningham, told the New York Times, referencing the dystopian sci-fi television show. “I’m kind of lost without him, to be quite honest.”
She told the Washington Post that she speaks with her brother often, but their conversation Feb. 12 left her concerned. “He sounded not like himself,” she said. He did not reply to a text message she sent later, and their mother, Tia-Juana Cunningham, was not able reach him either.
Terrell Cunningham also had concerns about recent interactions with his son, whom he described as focused on a host of professional and personal issues.
“The tone and the numerous exchanges gave us reason to be concerned about Tim,” he said. “And I don’t know if it’s an instinct you have because it’s your child, but it was not a normal conversation, and I was not comfortable.”
Remembrances.
On April 21, Morehouse College hosted a memorial service for Cunningham, which was attended by approximately 600 people. Cunningham had earned his undergraduate degree at Morehouse in 2004.
The memorial was a celebration of Tim's life, his passion for public service, and his drive to succeed. “It wasn’t just a career or job for him,” Capt. Marcella Law with the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion told the crowd. “Tim felt that it was his calling to use his gift and change lives.”

Lyman D. Foster

The Lyman D. Foster was an ocean-going, cargo-carrying, wooden sailing vessel named after the son of a provisions merchant who invested in vessels. Built at the Hall Brother's shipyard at Port Blakely, Washington (state), U.S.A. in 1892, she was 184 feet long with a 39-feet beam and 15.4 feet depth, and 778 tons in weight.
She had three separate incarnations.
Initially a four-masted schooner for the West Coast lumber trade, she was dismasted in April 1913 in a hurricane, and abandoned.
Her recovered hull was sold to the Government of Fiji and fitted out with machinery becoming the suction dredge, "Lady Escott".
In 1917, she was made seaworthy and re-rigged as a four-masted barquentine—once again as the "Lyman D. Foster"—for owners based in Auckland, New Zealand.
The "Lyman D. Foster" was last seen leaving Nukuʻalofa, Tonga on 26 March 1919 bound for San Francisco, with cargo of copra. On 29 October 1919, the vessel was posted as 'missing' by Lloyds, and remains so, over a century after her disappearance.
As a schooner.
The "Lyman D. Foster" was built at the Hall Brother's shipyard at Port Blakely, Washington (state), U.S.A. in 1892 as a four-masted schooner. She was named after the son of Samuel Foster, a provision merchant from San Francisco who invested in vessels.
She was used primarily to carry lumber from the US West Coast to Australia, and coal and other cargoes on the return journey, but visited other ports in the Pacific, including Suva, Honolulu, and Shanghai, typically carrying lumber on the outbound leg.
She was owned by G. E. Billings of San Francisco, and flew the flag of the United States of America.
Voyages.
Murder of Captain Dreyer (1896).
The "Lyman D. Forster" left Puget Sound on December 22, 1895, laden with lumber, for Shanghai.
On 25 February 1896, Captain Dreyer was suddenly attacked by the cook, without warning. Except for that, there are differences between the two versions of what happened. In one version—widely reported in Australia newspapers and said to have been reported via the steamer Tsinan—when the captain entered the donkey-room at 9:30 a.m., the cook attacked the captain with the galley axe. The steward went to the captain's assistance, and in trying to wrest the axe out of the cook's hands, was also cut in several places about the head. The cook then suddenly drew a revolver, and shot the captain twice in the left breast. The captain ran on deck, and informed the mate, who armed himself with a pair of handcuffs and revolver. The cook dodged about the galley and attacked another sailor with his axe, cutting him in about eight different places. The mate fired two shots into the galley. In the meantime, the cook soaked the gallery in kerosene and set fire to it. The cook was then subdued, handcuffed, and tied to the main mast. Using the pumps, the fire was extinguished. When the crew returned on deck, they found the cook had untied the rope with which he had been secured and, before anyone could catch him, he said "Goodbye," and committed suicide by jumping overboard. Captain Dreyer was mortally wounded, and died on the following day.
This version of events was also reported by the Truth (Sydney) with an explicit anti-Chinese bias.
However, there was a subsequent case at the U.S. Consular Court in Shanghai ("United States v. Linn and Gertzen, 1896") and - from the report in the San Francisco Call of 21 March 1896 - it is apparent that there is another, less sensational, version of events surrounding Captain Dreyer's murder. Under that other version, the cook used a carving knife to stab Captain Dreyer in the back, Dreyer died quickly, and the cook (Linn) and his assistant (Gertzen) survived to face trial for murder.
The "Lyman D. Foster" returned to Puget Sound from Shanghai under the temporary command of the mate.
Captain Killman and his family.
The next master of the "Lyman D. Foster" was Captain Daniel O. Killman, who retained command until the ship was abandoned in 1913.
Much is known of Killman's life at sea because he wrote an autobiography "Forty Years Master: a life in sail &amp; steam". His nickname amongst seafarers was "Crazy Killman", not so much due to his mental state but his single-minded determination.
Unusually, Killman's wife, Minnie, and his daughter accompanied him on voyages. His eldest daughter, Catherine Sudden Killman (named for Killman's previous command, the barquentine "Catherine Sudden"), spent most of the first fourteen years of her life at sea aboard the "Lyman D. Foster". During that time she visited many countries and ports. As an adult, she recalled that she had made five trips to Australia and, at the age of eight, had seen a bullfight at Mazatlan, Mexico.
Captain Killman instructed his daughter while at sea and she had to study hard. She went on to become a school teacher in Tacoma.
Explosion (1904).
Although the "Lyman D. Foster" relied on her sails for propulsion, like many ocean-going sailing vessels of the time, she was fitted with a steam boiler and donkey-engine. This engine reduced the manual labour needed to operate the vessel, by powering winches and pumps.
Leaving Puget Sound on a voyage to Sydney in 1904, the schooner was towed out from Whatcom—her loading port—and was abreast of Cape Flattery, when there was a terrific explosion.
The boiler of the donkey engine had burst and completely wrecked the deck house in the vicinity. The donkey engine Itself was also smashed to pieces, one portion crashing into a lifeboat and damaging it beyond repair.
The cook of the vessel was the only man hurt by the explosion. He was picked up among the wreckage, and was found to be badly scalded. The schooner immediately put back to Seattle, where the injured man was landed, and the necessary repairs made before continuing the voyage,
Wreck and abandonment.
Bound from Puget Sound to Suva with a cargo of a million feet of lumber, the "Lyman D. Foster" was caught in a hurricane off Turtle Island, in the Lau Group, on 15 April 1913.
Three eyewitness accounts of the hurricane exist. The first is a nearly contemporaneous account given by a steward from the schooner, as reported in the Daily Telegraph (Sydney) of 16 May 1913: The second account is that of Captain Killman, as reported in the Tacoma Daily Ledger of 3 August 1913—and so written just over four months after the event—which is quoted in the notes accompanying his autobiography. The third is the one written many years after the event, also by Captain Killman, which is included in his autobiography. The three accounts differ only slightly and are aligned concerning the sequence of events.
The hurricane struck the Lyman D. Foster between noon on 15 April 1913, when the wind began steadily increasing in force, and the following early morning. According to Captain Killman, the first damage to the ship occurred at around 9:00 p.m. when the a foresail blew away, and around 10:30 p.m. waves began breaking over the deck of the ship.
The schooner was carrying a portion of its cargo of lumber on the deck. Waves breaking over the deck shifted this deck-cargo and soon carried it over the sides of the ship. Approximately a third of the cargo was lost. in this way. Next, the main-mast broke in two and the loose part went over the side, unfortunately tearing way the chainplates in the process. The damage put great strain on the fore-mast, which also broke. The mizzen-mast broke next and—relatively gently—came to rest on the deck, but in doing so damaged the steering gear. By the morning, the rudder was gone.
The crew had no sleep that night but did manage to cut away the broken mizzen-mast.
Daylight revealed the extent of the damage; all the masts, the rudder and all the boats had been lost, together with a third of the cargo. The schooner was still afloat, but only just. The ship had taken on a lot of water. She had drawn 17-feet when leaving port fully laden but was now drawing 22-feet and so sitting very low in the water. None of the crew of eleven was seriously injured.
With no land in sight and no life-boats, the crew had no immediate choice but to stay with the floating hulk of the "Lyman D. Foster", despite the risk that swelling of the wet lumber cargo would damage the hull. They did however still have some charts—they were able to establish that they were drifting toward Fiji—some canned-meat and canned-fruits, and the remainder of the cargo of lumber. They also had 800 gallons of fresh water on board.
Captain D. O. Killman and the other ten members of the crew built two makeshift scows, using wood from the cargo and nails and other materials that they retrieved from the ship. They caulked the scows using rope "a"nd molten beeswax and made some sails.
The crew sighted a steamer but that ship did not see them, possibly because, without masts and low in the water, the "Lyman D. Foster" would not be visible at a distance.
On 1 May 1913, an island was sighted about 20-miles distant and it was decided that this was their best opportunity. The ship was abandoned at 8a.m. and it took the rest of the day to reach the island of Kabara—pronounced ]. Both scows were in great peril crossing the coral reef to reach the calmer water of the island's lagoon The scow under Captain Killman reach land first. the second one under the mate arrived only after darkness fell and then only thanks to some Fijians from Kabara who assisted it across the reef in darkness.
All the crew of the "Lyman D. Foster" had survived their ordeal by safely reaching Kabara. From there they proceeded to Levuka by cutter, arriving on 5 May 1913. After reaching Australia aboard a steamer, Captain Killman accepted command of the schooner "H.K.Hall" in Sydney.
Salvage and sale.
Once the "Lyman D. Foster" had been abandoned by its captain and crew, it became possible for other ships to attempt to recover the ship.
The "Lyman D. Foster", towed by the Union Co. steamer "Waipori", arrived at Suva on 13 May 1913. She had been anchored at the island of Totoya after having been recovered on 4 May 1913 and towed to that island by the inter-insular steamer "Ripple". The tow had been difficult as the "Lyman D. Foster" handled badly with its damaged rudder and was carrying water as well as the remaining part of her cargo of lumber.
The owners of the "Ripple" claimed salvage. This was disputed by the master of the "Lyman D. Foster" on the grounds that the recovery had taken place inside territorial waters, and so the Ripple's owners were only entitled to a reasonable towage fee. In the meantime, the Receiver of Wrecks under a colonial ordinance, sold the salvaged cargo but retained the proceeds until the interested parties arrived at an understanding or obtained a decision from the Court.
The hull of the "Lyman D. Foster" was bought by the Government of Fiji, for a bargain price of £240 at auction, with the remaining cargo sold for £4,244. Government engineers had identified a means of docking her locally by a temporary modification to the slip. Her owners had thought that she was too big to place on the slip at Suva, and it would have been very costly to send her to Sydney to be docked.
As the dredge "Lady Escott".
A dredge was needed for harbour improvement works and land reclamation at Suva. When Mr. C. W. Harris, engineer in charge of the Suva harbour works, saw what remained of the "Lyman D. Foster" in Suva, he decided that she was suitable for the purpose, and bought the vessel for the Fiji Government.
The hull was docked on the slip in Suva, found to be in good condition, repaired, and fitted out with machinery, to become the suction dredge known as the "Lady Escott". The dredge was named for the wife of the then Governor of Fiji, Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott.
By 1916, the shipping losses during World War 1 had resulted in a huge increase in the value of ship's hulls and, when the government no longer needed the dredge, it was put up for sale by tender. By June 1917, the dredge had been sold to the Kaipara Steamship Company of Auckland, New Zealand.
In the 1920s, there was a Fiji Government yacht also named after Lady Escott. The second 'Lady Escott' foundered on 11 January 1930, after breaking its moorings in a storm.
As a barquentine.
The Union Company steamer "Karori" towed the hulk 1200 miles from Suva to Auckland, arriving in August 1917. While under tow, the hulk was in the charge of Captain John Francis Place, an early European settler of Fiji.
The hulk was in the Calliope Dock by late September 1917. The dredging machinery was removed and—once again named the "Lyman D. Foster"—the vessel was made seaworthy again. She was fitted with the four masts from the American schooner "E. B. Jackson", which went ashore at the entrance to Apia Harbour and became a total wreck. It was planned to replace the fore-mast with an iron mast—in good condition—taken from the old ship "America". The "Lyman D. Foster" was re-rigged as a four-masted barquentine.
The newly rigged barquentine left Auckland and returned from San Francisco with a cargo of 'case-oil', arriving in Auckland on 5 July 1918. On this first voyage as a barquentine, her master was Captain Andrew J. Lockie, a New Zealander, who later commanded the ill-fated SS "Canastota".
The "Lyman D. Foster" left Auckland again on 5 August 1918, to pick up a cargo of copra from Tonga, which she reached on 24 August 1918, bound for San Francisco. She left San Francisco on 12 December 1918 and completed her second voyage on 29 January 1919, when she returned to Auckland.
On the second voyage, the master was Captain Frederick Ferdinand Nilsson, a Swedish-born experienced master, who was some years earlier the master of the barque "Manurewa" (later lost with all hands in April 1922). Nilsson resided with his wife and family at Stanley Point in Auckland, New Zealand.
Disappearance and Aftermath.
The "Lyman D. Foster" left Auckland on 1 March 1919, on her third voyage as a barquentine, under the command of Captain Nilsson.
She called at Nukuʻalofa, Tonga, to pick up a cargo of copra, a material known for its propensity to spontaneously combust.
On 26 March 1919, the ship left Nukuʻalofa, bound for San Francisco, and was never heard from again. At the time of her disappearance, her crew was 12 men.
As sailing ships relied upon the prevailing weather and could not reliably maintain a set speed, initially, it was thought that the "Lyman D. Foster" had been becalmed. When ships began to arrive in San Francisco that had left Tonga well after the "Lyman D. Foster", it became apparent that the "Lyman D. Foster" had been lost with all hands.
The "Lyman D. Foster" was posted as 'missing' by Lloyds, on 29 October 1919, and remains so a century after her disappearance. No trace of her was ever found.
The wages of the crew—£175 3s.—were still owing and it was necessary to determine a date for the loss of the ship in order that those wages could be paid to the dependents of the crew members. The Auckland Magistrate's Court sat on 23 November 1920 to determine the matter. Evidence was given by Captain Charles Fleming, Superintendent of Marine, that there had been very bad weather subsequent to the ship leaving Nukuʻalofa. The date of the loss was fixed as 31 March 1919. Compensation of £500 each was given to two widows of lost crewmen.

Endless Express

Endless Express is a first-person simulation video game developed in 2014 by Florian Veltman, Alexandre Taillefert, Martin Gugger, Felix Meunier, and Baptiste Virot. The game was first created as part of a 7-day game jam, but was later "reimagined" and re-titled "The Endless Express" in 2016, however, the project was discontinued, with its work-in-progress build publicly released. "Endless Express" was released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems.
Development.
"Endless Express" was the product of a five person team collaborating at a "7DFPS" game jam in 2014 - an event which is meant for first-person shooter video games, as noted by "PC Gamer".
Gameplay.
"Endless Express"' starts off with the player waking up in a train station. Using only a watch and a train timetable, they must find their way home, being sure to catch the correct trains. The game is a combination between accelerated time and semi-real-time, with train stations being in real time and the travel being accelerated. The game also makes use of different animation styles, with low-polygonal textures for terrain, while using a cartoonish style elsewhere.
Reception.
In a November 2014 article, "PC Gamer" called the gameplay of "Endless Express" "compelling", with "Kotaku" stating that it was "full of charm." Killscreen described the game as having a "dreamlike quality...magical realism."

Phytosanitary irradiation

Phytosanitary irradiation is a treatment that uses ionizing radiation on commodities, such as fruits and vegetables to inactivate pests, such as insects. This method is used for international food trade as a means to prevent spread of non-native organisms. It is used as an alternative to conventional techniques, which includes heat treatment, cold treatment, pesticide sprays, high pressure treatment, cleaning, waxing or chemical fumigation. It is often used on spices, grains, and non-food items. It inhibits the species reproduction cycle by destroying nuclear material primarily, whereas other methods are measured by species mortality. Each country has different effective approved dosages, although most follow guidelines established by the IPPC which has issued guidelines referred to as the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM). The most commonly used dose is 400 Gy (as a broad spectrum, generic treatment) based on USDA-APHIS guidelines.
History.
The foundations of ionizing radiation was first discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen through discovery of x-rays. In the following year, Henri Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity, another form of ionizing radiation. Soon after the discovery of ionizing radiation, therapeutic use and bactericide treatments were proposed. Research in the early 1900s demonstrated that X-rays can destroy and hinder the development of the egg, larval and adult stages of cigar beetles. Application of irradiation as a disinfestation procedure for fruit flies was suggested in 1930, however, it was only in 1986 that irradiation up to 1kGy was approved by the FDA as a method to disinfest arthropods in food. Before approval in the United States, Hawaii petitioned for permission of irradiation on papayas in 1972. The FDA finally approved the use of 1 kGy for use on arthropods in fruits and vegetables in 1986. In that same year, the first case of commercial phytosanitary irradiation occurred with Puerto Rican mangoes imported to the Florida market. Three years later, Hawaii received approval for irradiation of papayas at 150 Gy for shipment to mainland U.S. In 2004, Australia and New Zealand opened their markets to phytosanitary irradiation. In 2007, India sent a shipment of mangoes to the U.S., followed by fruit from Thailand, Vietnam, and Mexico. Australia continues to broaden their irradiated exports with new markets in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.
Mode of action.
Ionizing radiation such as gamma rays, electron beam, X-rays can be used to provide phytosanitary treatment. The direct effect of these high energy photons and electrons, as well as the free radicals they produce result in sufficient damage to large organic molecules such as DNA and RNA resulting in sterilization, morbidity or mortality of the target pests. The sources of irradiation for gamma rays are Cobalt 60 and Cesium 137. X-rays are produced by accelerating electrons at a metal sources such as gold and electron beams are produced via an electron accelerator.
Commercial use.
Phytosanitary irradiation is used to control the spread of non-native species from one geographical area to another. Global trade allows for the procurement of seasonal produce all year round from all over the world, however, there are risks involved due to the spread of invasive species. Irradiation is highly effective as a phytosanitary measure and as a non-thermal treatment, also helps maintain quality of fresh produce. The most commonly used generic dose is 400 Gy to cover most pests of concern except pupae and adults of the order Lepidoptera, which includes moths and butterflies. Generic doses are the dose level used for a specific group of pests and/or products. Irradiation treatment levels depend upon the pests of concern.
Advantages.
A key advantage of phytosanitary irradiation is that treatment doses are tolerated by many commodities without adverse effects on their sensory and physicochemical profiles. Conventional methods of phytosanitation, such as hot water dips and fumigation with methyl bromide, can affect sensory quality and damage the fruit. Compared to the doses used for microorganisms, the doses for phytosanitation are considerable lower and adverse effects are minimal. In some climacteric fruit, irradiation delays ripening which extends shelf life and allows the fruit to maintain quality for the long distance shipment between harvest and consumption. Since 2000, phytosanitary irradiation has seen a 10% increase every year. This is in part due to increased restrictions on conventionally used chemicals and the effectiveness in a wide variety of produce. In certain fruits such as rambutan, irradiation is the only method capable of treatment without extensive deterioration as seen from commercial methods. In addition, temperature based phytosanitation methods and chemical fumigation are not entirely reliable. Import inspections still find live pests in commodities treated with these methods.
Disadvantages.
Some fruit, such as certain varieties of citrus and avocados have a low tolerance to irradiation and show symptoms of phytotoxicity at low irradiation levels. Sensitivity to irradiation depends on many factors, such as irradiation dose, commodity, and storage conditions. In addition, organic food industries prohibit the use of irradiation on organic products. Lack of communication and education regarding phytosanitary irradiation can hamper its use. Since this treatment causes reproductive sterilization, pests may be present during commodity inspection. The presence of live pests conflict with current inspection standards and there is no clear marker of treatment efficacy. Some other challenges in relation to the commercialization and acceptance of this technology can be attributed to lack of sufficient facilities, cost and inconvenience of treatment, lack of approved treatment for certain pests and concerns about its technology by the key decision makers (traders, shippers, packers). Lack of harmonization of regulations across countries is also a factor that limits its use. Although, phytosanitary irradiation has seen an increase in use globally, lack of consumer acceptance in the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan limits its use in countries for which these are major export markets.

<doc id="56709430" url="?curid=56709430" title="Christian persecution complex">
Christian persecution complex

Christian persecution complex is a belief, attitude or world view that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments. This belief is promoted by certain American Protestant churches, and some Christian- or Bible-based cults in Europe. It has been called the "Evangelical", "American Christian" or "Christian right" persecution complex.
Early Christianity.
According to New Testament scholar Candida Moss the Christian "persecution complex" appeared during the era of early Christianity due to internal Christian identity politics. Moss suggested that the idea of persecution is cardinal to the worldview of Christianity, noting that it creates the impression that Christians are a minority that are facing a war – even though they are numerically superior. This perception is grounded in the manichaeistic belief that the world is divided into two factions, one led by God and the other by Satan. In this view there can be no compromise between the two, and even attempting to dialogue or engage with "the other" is seen as a form of collaboration with it. Medieval historian Paul Cavill argues that the New Testament teaches that persecutions are inherent to Christianity.
20th and 21st centuries.
Many find it difficult to define the origin of the Christian persecution complex. According to Elizabeth Castelli, some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century, following a series of court rulings that declared public places to be out of bounds for religious activity (e.g. state-sanctioned morning prayer in schools). However, it became apparent in the United States in the 1990s with the adoption of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 as the official foreign policy. A few years later, the September 11 attacks boosted its development. This complex "mobilizes the language of religious persecution to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority".
The concept that Christianity is being oppressed is popular among conservative politicians in contemporary politics in the United States, and they utilize this idea to address issues concerning LGBT people or the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, which they perceive as an attack on Christianity. The application of the contraceptive mandate to closely held corporations with religious objections was struck down by the Supreme Court in "Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc."
Hornback notes that the Christian persecution complex is widespread among nationalists in Europe, who feel that they are defending the continent from a new Islamic invasion. Francesca Stavrakopoulou explains that the advances of secularism, such as dropping catechism from publicly funded schools, is perceived by some Christians as persecution.
Christian persecution complex has an impact on popular culture, with films which "imagine embattled Christians prevailing against entrenched secularist opposition". David Ehrlich, a film critic, describes how the persecution complex is fueled by films and media such as the "God's Not Dead" saga.
In a conversation at the British Humanist Congress in 2014, Stavrakopoulou suggested that some Christian fundamentalists perceive the advancement of secularism as a threat, and that this may support the idea of a persecution complex.
Some contemporary white nationalists promote a narrative of Western persecution of Christians, arguing that they, rather than minority or immigrant populations, are most often attacked and marginalized.
Some Christian journalists point out that "American Christians have a persecution complex" while noting that the persecution of Christians is real in the Middle East.

Xp11.2 duplication

Xp11.2 duplication is a genomic variation marked by the duplication of an X chromosome region on the short arm p at position 11.2, defined by standard karyotyping (G-banding). This gene-rich, rearrangement prone region can be further divided into three loci - Xp11.21, Xp11.22 and Xp11.23. The duplication could involve any combination of these three loci. While the length of the duplication can vary from 0.5Mb to 55 Mb, most duplications measure about 4.5Mb and typically occur in the region of 11.22-11.23. Most affected females show preferential activation of the duplicated X chromosome. Features of affected individuals vary significantly, even among members of the same family. The Xp11.2 duplication can be 'silent' - presenting no obvious symptoms in carriers - which is known from the asymptomatic parents of affected children carrying the duplication. The common symptoms include intellectual disabilities, speech delay and learning difficulties, while in rare cases, children have seizures and a recognizable brain wave pattern when assessed by EEG (electroencephalography).
Symptoms and signs.
Information on the clinical symptoms and features is taken from the Human Phenotype Ontology database and the "Unique" database. All affected individuals needn't show all the symptoms. Some of the most noted features are:
Intellectual and Learning Disabilities.
Among people who need support with their learning, at least 3% are believed to carry the duplication. It is noted that affected members of the same family with the same Xp11.2 microduplication generally have similar learning profiles. Children with small duplications of 0.5-1.3 Mb seem to have a mild learning difficulty, while others with the typical duplication of around 4.5 Mb generally have a borderline, mild or moderate learning disability. An extreme case with a very large duplication of 55 Mb has shown to have a severe intellectual disability.
Speech Delay.
Speech is very commonly affected and usually the first sign. Both speech and comprehension seem to be affected, to various degrees of extent. Low facial muscle tone underlies difficulty in making certain sounds of speech. Nasal or hoarse voice are also observed. Babies are known to be unable to suck from breast in their infancy due to weak facial muscles.
Early Puberty.
Early puberty occurs in 80% of the affected children or adults, with girls starting their menstrual cycles as early as age 9 and boys showing signs of puberty at age 8.5. One boy from "Unique" had completed puberty by age 13.
Weight problems.
Affected children show tendency to be overweight. This might indicate metabolism issues.
Lower-extremity Anomalies.
Anomalies of lower limbs or feet are common in people with an Xp11.2 duplication, affecting about 71% cases. Features include flat feet, arched feet (pes cavus), clubfoot (talipes), narrow feet, webbed or joined toes/fingers (syndactyly), 5th finger clinodactyly, 5th toe hypoplasia, and tapering fingers.
Unusual EEG Pattern.
A typical pattern of electrical activity in the brain of affected children, described as ‘subclinical seizures’ has been noted. A peculiar electroencephalographic pattern characterized by rolandic-like spikes and/or continuous spike wave during slow sleep (CSWS), also called centro-temporal focal spike, exists in childhood.
Minor Facial Features.
The common unusual features include a short or flat groove between the nose and upper lip (philtrum), a large, high or deep nasal bridge, bushy eyebrows and/or uni-brow (synophrys), and thin lips.
Cause.
Using array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) to screen 2,400 individuals with isolated or syndromic mental retardation for copy number variation, Giorda et al. (2009) identified 8 (0.33%) unrelated individuals, 2 males and 6 females, with a microduplication at chromosome Xp11.23-p11.22. The rearrangement was familial in 3 patients. A female patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with her affected mother and sister, and an unrelated male patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with his affected mother and sister. A third unrelated male inherited a smaller 0.8-Mb duplication from his unaffected mother. Three additional individuals had "de novo" 4.5-Mb duplications, and 2 more had partially overlapping "de novo" 6.0- and 9.2-Mb duplications. Paternal origin of the duplication was demonstrated in all "de novo" female cases. Six affected females had selective inactivation of the normal X chromosome, whereas 3 had random X inactivation. Breakpoints could be identified in 8 individuals. The recurrent duplication was flanked distally by a segmental duplication (D-REP at 47.8-48.2 Mb) containing a cluster of genes and pseudogenes of the synovial sarcoma X breakpoint (SSX) and proximally by a complex repeat (P-REP at 52.1-53.1 Mb) rich in SSX, melanoma antigen and X antigen (XAGE) genes. Sequence analysis of the junctions demonstrated that the recurrent 4.5-Mb duplications were mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) or Alu-mediated recombination. The majority of these recombinations occurred between flanking complex segmental duplications. Region of duplication and copy number variation can be further confirmed by Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and PCR.
Genetics.
The duplication at Xp11.2, especially the Xp11.22-11.23 region is syndromic and is implicated in X-linked mental retardation. The chromosomal duplication can be "de novo" or familial. Familial carriers of small duplication (&lt;1 Mb) show X-linked recessive inheritance. All other affected individuals with larger duplication present dominant expression and comparable clinical phenotypes irrespective of sex, duplication size, and X-inactivation pattern.
Xp11.22 comprises approximately 5 Mb of DNA (chrX:49,800,001–54,800,000, hg19). A number of pathogenic deletions and duplications involving Xp11.22 have been described in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or autism. These phenotypes have been attributed to changes in the copy number of several genes including "HUWE1", "KDM5C, IQSEC2, TSPYL2, SHROOM4," "PHF8" and "FAM120C."
"HUWE1".
The HECT, UBA and WWE domain-containing protein 1 ("HUWE1") is a HECT family ubiquitin ligase located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 with growing genetic links to cancer and intellectual disability. Expression of the "HUWE1" gene is found in several mouse tissues including cortex, hippocampus, tongue, eye, kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and fibroblasts. Increased copies of "HUWE1" are associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability. Missense mutations in "HUWE1" occur in multiple families with intellectual disability, including families with Juberg-Marsidi-Brooks syndrome. Patients with missense mutations in "HUWE1" share clinical features with patients with a duplication of "HUWE1". This suggests both increased and decreased "HUWE1" function could be associated with intellectual disability, but evidence from an "in vivo" model system supporting or refuting this possibility remains absent.
"KDM5C".
"KDM5C" (Lysine-Specific Demethylase 5C) also known as jumonji, A/T-rich interactive domain 1C ("JARID1C") is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22-p11.21. The gene encodes a 1560 amino-acid protein that belongs to the JARID1 subfamily of Arid DNA-binding proteins. The protein possesses H3K4me3-specific demethylase activity and is shown to function as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex.
The mutations in "KDM5C" cause Claes-Jensen type syndromic X-linked Intellectual Disability characterized by moderate-to-severe ID, speech abnormalities and other clinical findings such as seizures and aggressive behavior in some individuals. There is also a report of a mutation in a patient with autism spectrum disorder. A study showed that "Kdm5c"-knockout mice exhibit adaptive and cognitive abnormalities similar to those in human X-linked intellectual disability and concluded that histone methylation dynamics sculpt the neuronal network.
"IQSEC2".
IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 "(IQSEC2)," also known as "BRAG1" or "IQ-ARFGEF", is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 and encodes guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins (ARFGEF). It is expressed in the neurons and is involved in cytoskeletal organization, dendritic spine morphology, and excitatory synaptic organization.
Mutations in "IQSEC2" are widely associated in cases of X-linked non-syndromic mental retardation, with some carrier females reported with learning disabilities. This gene is known to play a significant role in the maintenance of homeostasis within the neural environment of the human brain. A change of guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity may influence the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain by reduced activation of the "ARF6" substrate or a defect in the GTP-binding activity.
Two intragenic duplications predicted to cause termination mutations on the X-chromosome involving "IQSEC2" were identified in two "de novo" cases, and one nonsense mutation was described in three additional male patients presenting severe intellectual disability and additional clinical features including neonatal hypotonia, delayed motor skills, seizures, strabismus, autistic-like behavior, stereotypic midline hand movements, microcephaly, little-to-no walking, little-to-no language skills, significant behavioral issues, and mildly abnormal facial features. A novel "de novo" mutation in the "IQSEC2" gene identified through diagnostic exome sequencing showed significant developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, vision impairments, plagiocephaly, autistic-like features, absent language skills, and abnormal MRI findings. "IQSEC2" gene plays a larger role in the cause of X-linked cognitive impairment than previously thought. Additional consideration is warranted with regards to the syndromic nature of its phenotypic association.
"TSPYL2".
Testis-Specific Protein Y-encoded (TSPY) Like 2 ("TSPYL2") codes for a member of the TSPY-like/SET/nucleosome assembly protein-1 superfamily and is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22. The encoded protein is localized to the nucleolus where it functions in chromatin remodeling and as an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression. Consistent with a possible role for "Tspyl2" pathways in neurodevelopment, Xp11.2 microduplication incorporating the "TSPYL2" locus has been reported in male patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
"SHROOM4".
Shroom Family Member 4 "(SHROOM4)", also known as "KIAA1202", encodes a member of the APX/Shroom family, which contains an N-terminal PDZ domain and a C-terminal ASD2 motif. It is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 and is mainly associated with the Stocco dos Santos X-linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by cognitive disabilities. The encoded protein may play a role in cytoskeletal architecture. Symptoms of "SHROOM4" gene mutations in the original family described by Stocco dos Santos include severe intellectual disability, bilateral congenital hip luxation and short stature. The "SHROOM4" gene was also found to be disrupted in two unrelated females with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Other features included delayed or no speech, seizures, kyphosis and hyperactivity. Carrier females displayed seizures and depression. No mutations in "SHROOM4" were identified in more than 1000 control X chromosomes.

Oxytocin/neurophysin i prepropeptide

Oxytocin/neurophysin I prepropeptide is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OXT gene.
Function.
This gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed to produce oxytocin and neurophysin I. Oxytocin is a posterior pituitary hormone which is synthesized as an inactive precursor in the hypothalamus along with its carrier protein neurophysin I. Together with neurophysin, it is packaged into neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in the neurohypophysis, where it is either stored or secreted into the bloodstream. The precursor seems to be activated while it is being transported along the axon to the posterior pituitary. This hormone contracts smooth muscle during parturition and lactation. It is also involved in cognition, tolerance, adaptation and complex sexual and maternal behaviour, as well as in the regulation of water excretion and cardiovascular functions.

Microtis pulchella

Microtis pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful mignonette orchid or beautiful onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to twenty five white, thinly textured flowers with a slight perfume. It only flowers after fire and only sometimes produces short, thread-like leaves in the absence of fire.
Description.
"Microtis pulchella" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between five and twenty five thinly textured, white flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The flowers are lightly perfumed, long and wide and droop as they age. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, about wide and flat or slightly concave. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and spread apart. The petals are lance-shaped, about long, wide and curved. The labellum is more or less oval, long, wide with slightly wavy or toothed edges. There are two raised, dark green calli in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January but only after fire the previous summer. Non-flowering plants sometimes produce a thread-like leaf long.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis pulchella" was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen". The specific epithet ("pulchella") is a Latin word meaning "beautiful", referring to the flowers of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The beautiful mignonette orchid grows in peaty swamps, often forming large colonies between Albany and Augusta.
Conservation.
"Microtis alba" is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

Keepin' Up with the Joneses is an album by The Jones Brothers: Thad Jones, Hank Jones, and Elvin Jones, recorded for the MetroJazz label in 1958.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states: "In spite of their very long careers in jazz, brothers Hank, Thad and Elvin Jones made relatively few recordings together; this Leonard Feather-produced date got the three of them into the studio and added to the gimmick by including Eddie Jones (no relation) on bass, and performing exclusively works by Thad or Isham Jones (also no relation). ... Thad's rich flugelhorn is as strong as on any date he ever recorded, while Hank's playing is a little more reserved than usual, and Elvin, known for his fierce attack, sticks mainly to brushes".

United Kingdom–United States relations in World War II

The UK-US relations in World War II comprised an extensive and highly complex relationships, in terms of diplomacy, military action, financing, and supplies. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt formed close personal ties, that operated apart from their respective diplomatic and military organizations.
Leadership issues.
While Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill have thoroughly dominated the popular and scholarly writings, each stood atop a complex decision-making system that guaranteed inputs from military, diplomatic, business and public opinion.
In terms of foreign-policy, Roosevelt for years had developed a system whereby he made all the major decisions. Secretary of State, Cordell Hull was relegated to ceremonial roles. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. had the loudest voice in financial matters, and was deeply engaged in foreign policy, especially regarding Lend Lease, China, Jews and Germany. Although Roosevelt himself was quite pragmatic about moral issues, the image he presented to outsiders, especially the British, grated on their sensibilities. British foreign minister Anthony Eden told his war cabinet, "Soviet policy is amoral; United States policy is exaggeratedly moral, at least where non-American interests are concerned."
In military affairs, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was headed by Admiral William D. Leahy, a close personal friend of the president for decades. It dealt directly with their British counterparts in a new organization, the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which was based in Washington. Military decisions were made through the joint Chiefs and the combined chiefs, and they issued the orders to the theatre chiefs. The chiefs were in command of all Allied forces in their geographical zone. This was a new concept in military history, one promoted by General Marshall and accepted reluctantly at first by the British. In terms of British-American military teamwork, the key theaters were the Mediterranean and the West European--SHAEF. US general Dwight D. Eisenhower Headed the Mediterranean Theater 1943–44, then moved to SHAEF.
Historians have always paid special attention to the Roosevelt-Churchill friendship. They also have explored how the two men dealt with Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator. Roosevelt and Churchill met in person 11 times. They exchanged 1700 cables and letters and they even made some international phone calls. Roosevelt also sent top aides, especially Harry Hopkins and to a lesser extent W. Averell Harriman. Harriman accompanied Churchill to the Moscow Conference in 1942 to explain to Stalin why the western allies were carrying out operations in North Africa instead of opening the promised second front in France. Harriman was appointed as Ambassador to the USSR in 1943.
Churchill ran a coalition government, with all parties represented. He dominated his War Cabinet. Clement Attlee, the leader of the Labour party, was Deputy Prime Minister and handled practically all domestic affairs. He did so very quietly, usually backstage. Churchill, like Roosevelt, relied on charisma and a very strong public image, to rally public opinion. Churchill handled all the top foreign policy decisions himself, with his Foreign Minister Anthony Eden taking charge only of lower visibility issues. Churchill made himself Ministry of Defence, And repeatedly interfered and reshaped and argued with his chiefs of staff. Historians generally agree with the quality of Churchill's wartime leadership, often emphasizing his remarkable success in obtaining American support. Richard Wilkinson, who is more critical than most historians, nevertheless argues:
The British sent two ambassadors to Washington; each achieved very positive reputations for handling American leaders and influencing American public opinion. Lord Lothian served in 1930–40. On his death Lord Halifax took charge, 1940–46. Halifax as Foreign Minister (1938–40) had been a leader of the appeasement movement before 1939, but then reversed himself and took an aggressive anti-Hitler position. The US Ambassador 1938-40 Joseph P. Kennedy was a defeatist who in 1940 warned Roosevelt that Britain was doomed. Roosevelt could not remove Kennedy because he needed Irish support in the major cities in the 1940 election, Kennedy endorsed Roosevelt then retired, to be replaced by low-key Republican John Winant, who did well in London, 1941–46.
After the declarations of war, foreign-policy issues were no longer high on the political agenda. Appeasement was dead in Britain; isolationism was dead in the United States. After the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, foreign-policy was rarely discussed by Congress, and there was very little demand to cut Lend Lease spending. In spring 1944, the House passed a bill to renew the Lend Lease program by a vote of 334 to 21. The Senate passed it by a vote of 63 to 1.
Top level conferences.
Atlantic Charter 1941.
Roosevelt and Churchill met secretly at Placentia Bay in Newfoundland in August 1941, and issued a policy statement that became the foundation document for the Allies who later joined the war against Germany.-- A country had to join to gain admission to the United Nations. The Atlantic Charter defined the Allied goals for the post world war. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war—no territorial aggrandizement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, self-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of trade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the "Declaration by United Nations" on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern United Nations. The Charter was a powerful propaganda weapon, but Churchill, profoundly committed to maintaining British Empire, claimed it did not apply to British possessions. Churchill's insistence on full control was signaled when he did not bring along his foreign minister Anthony Eden.
Arcadia, 1941-1942.
The Arcadia Conference was held in Washington, from December 22, 1941 to January 14, 1942, bringing together the top British and American military leaders. Churchill and Roosevelt and their aides had very candid conversations that led to a series of major decisions that shaped the war effort in 1942–1943. The decision was made to invade North Africa in 1942, to send American bombers to bases in England, and for the British to strengthen their forces in the Pacific. The Conference established the Combined Chiefs of Staff, headquartered in Washington, which approved and finalized all military decisions. It also created a unified American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) in the Far East; it fared poorly. Finally the conference drafted the "Declaration by United Nations", which committed the Allies to make no separate peace with the enemy, and to employ full resources until victory.
Quebec Conference, 1943.
At the Quebec Conference, 1943 held in Canada in August 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and the Combined Chiefs plotted strategy against Germany. They began planning the invasion of France, codenamed Overlord using a report by the Combined Chiefs. They also discussed an increase of the bombing offensive against facilities Germany was using in France and the Low Countries. They decided to continue the buildup of American forces in Britain prior to an invasion of France. Churchill kept drawing attention to the advantages of operations in the Mediterranean theatre. They agreed to use more force to force Italy out of the war, and to occupy it along with Corsica. Military cooperation was close and successful. The Prime Minister of Canada was the host, but no Canadians attended the secret meetings.
Casablanca Conference 1943.
From January 14–24, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in Casablanca, Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. They blended British and American offensive concepts. At Roosevelt's demand, they agreed on a policy of "unconditional surrender." This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end. A major problem was to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. Roosevelt strongly disliked de Gaulle, while Churchill championed him. The final decision was to split control of liberated French areas between the two Frenchmen. By 1944, de Gaulle prevailed, but he never forgave Roosevelt and always distrusted Anglo-Saxon collaboration as hostile to French interests.
Lend-Lease.
The Americans spent about $50 billion on Lend Lease aid to the British Empire, the Soviet Union, France, China, and some smaller countries. That amounted to about 11% of the cost of the war to the U.S.. It received back about $7.8 billion in goods and services provided by the recipients to the United States, especially the cost of rent for American installations abroad. Lend Lease aid was usually not dollars that the recipient could use for any purpose. Instead it was supplies and services counted by the dollar value of military and naval munitions as well as civilian supplies such as freighters, oil, food, chemicals, metals, machinery, rent and shipping services. The total given to the British Empire, 1940-45 was $30.0 billion. This includes supplies to India, Australia, and the other dominions and colonies. Russia received $10.7 billion, and all other countries $2.9 billion. The question of repayment came up, and Roosevelt repeatedly insisted the United States did not want a postwar debt problem of the sort that had troubled relations after the first world war. A small fraction of goods that were still useful – such as merchant ships – were returned to the United States. The recipients provided bases and supplies to American forces on their own soil. The cost, including rents, was called "Reverse Lend Lease", that is, aid given to the United States. It came to $7.8 billion overall, of which 86% came from the British Empire. Canada operated a similar program on behalf of Great Britain, and Britain itself operated a similar one for the Soviet Union. In terms of repaying Washington after the war ended, the policy became one of fair shares. In the end, no one paid for the goods it received, although they did pay for goods in transit that were received after the program ended . Roosevelt told Congress in June 1942:
Military cooperation.
The Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS) was the supreme military staff for the United States and Great Britain during World War II. It set all the major policy decisions for the two nations, subject to the approvals of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D Roosevelt. It controlled forces from all the Allied nations in all theaters, including the Pacific, India and North Africa. Representatives of allied nations were not members of the CCS. Instead the usual procedure included consultation with "Military Representatives of Associated Powers" on strategic issues.
Technical collaboration.
Technical collaboration was close, as the two nations shared secrets and weapons regarding the proximity fuze and radar, as well as airplane engines, Nazi codes, and the atomic bomb.
India.
Serious tension erupted over American support for independence for India, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism. The politically active Indian population was deeply divided. One element was so insistent on the expulsion of the British, that it sided with Germany and Japan, and formed the Indian National Army (INA) from Indian prisoners of war. It fought as part of the Japanese invasion of Burma and eastern India. There was a large pacifist element, which rallied to Gandhi's call for abstention from the war; he said that violence in every form was evil. There was a high level of religious tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslims minority. For the first time the Muslim community became politically active, giving strong support for the British war effort. Over 2 million Indians volunteered for military service, including a large Muslim contingent. The British were sensitive to demands of the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, since it needed Muslim soldiers in India and Muslim support all across the Middle East. London used the religious tensions in India as a justification to continue its rule, saying it was needed to prevent religious massacres of the sort that did happen in 1947. The imperialist element in Britain was strongly represented in the Conservative party; Churchill himself had long been its leading spokesman.
On the other hand, Attlee and the Labour Party favoured independence and had close ties to the Congress Party. The British cabinet sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India with a specific peace plan offering India the promise of dominion status after the war. Congress demanded independence immediately and the Cripps mission failed. Roosevelt gave support to Congress, sending his representative Louis Johnson to help negotiate some sort of independence. Churchill was outraged, refused to cooperate with Roosevelt on the issue, and threatened to resign as prime minister if Roosevelt pushed too hard. Roosevelt pulled back. In 1942 when the Congress Party launched a Quit India Movement of nonviolent civil disobedience, the Raj police immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists (including Gandhi), holding them for the duration. Meanwhile, wartime disruptions caused severe food shortages in eastern India; hundreds of thousands died of starvation. To this day a large Indian element blames Churchill for the Bengal famine of 1943. In terms of the war effort, India became a major base for American supplies sent to India, and Lend Lease operations boosted the local economy. The 2 million Indian soldiers were a major factor in British success in the Middle East. Muslim support for the British war effort proved decisive in the British decision to partition the Raj, forming of the new state of Pakistan.

The Day the Rains Came (song)

"The Day the Rains Came" is a song made famous by Jane Morgan, which she released in 1958 as a single and on the album "The Day the Rains Came". The song is an adaptation of the French-language song "Le jour où la pluie viendra", which itself was the B-side of Morgan's version. The French lyrics were written by Pierre Delanoë. The music was composed by Gilbert Bécaud and the English lyrics were written by Carl Sigman.
In 1957, versions of "Le jour où la pluie viendra" were released Gilbert Bécaud and by Dalida. Bécaud and Dalida's versions reached No. 3 in Wallonia, in a tandem ranking, while Bécaud's version reached No. 20 in Flanders independently.
Jane Morgan's version of the song reached No. 1 on the UK's "New Musical Express" chart, spending 16 weeks on the chart overall, while spending 15 weeks on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 21. The song also reached No. 4 on Canada's CHUM Hit Parade and No. 7 on Norway's VG-lista.
An instrumental version was released by Raymond Lefèvre and His Orchestra in 1958, which spent nine weeks on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 30.
In a tandem ranking of Jane Morgan, Raymond Lefèvre, and Dalida's recordings, with Morgan and Lefèvre's versions marked as bestsellers, the song reached No. 17 on the "Cash Box" Top 100 in November 1958. In December 1958, the song reached No. 2 on "Billboard"s chart of "Best Selling Sheet Music in U.S."
In 1959, a German-language version was released by Dalida, titled "Am Tag als der Regen kam", which reached No. 1 in Germany.

Fontana History of European War and Society

The Fontana History of European War and Society is a five-volume history of war and society in Europe from 1450 to 1970. It was published by Fontana in association with the University of Leicester. The series editor was Geoffrey Best, who also wrote the first volume in the series.
Critical opinion.
Ian Beckett described the series as a synthesis made possible by a flourishing of new, more specialised, studies, which had begun to appear after the Second World War, but took the view that Victor Kiernan's Marxist treatment of empire had not dated well. John Rigby Hale's volume, on the other hand, was described as a "model of historical writing" by Beckett, as part of a post-war movement to rescue the history of warfare from the memoirs of generals and from museum experts writing about armour and weapons.

Kurt Kresse

Kurt Kresse (15 May 1904 – 11 January 1945) was a German communist and resistance fighter against Nazism.
Biography.
Kresse was born into a working-class family in Leipzig. In his youth, he worked as a miner and from 1924 onwards as a book printer. He joined the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) in 1920 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1924. He served as member of the district leadership of the KPD in Western Saxony and as chairman of the workers' sports club "Fichte West" in Leipzig.
After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Kresse was arrested and spent time in prison and in Colditz concentration camp. After his release, he joined the resistance group around Georg Schumann. Kresse's tasks included rebuilding the underground KPD organization, making contacts with other anti-fascists and committing acts of sabotage against the war production.
On 19 June 1944, Kresse was arrested again. He was sentenced to death by the People's Court in Dresden on 21 November 1944, and executed by hanging on 11 January 1945 in Dresden together with fellow resistance fighters Georg Schumann and Otto Engert. After the fall of the Nazi regime, his remains were buried in the Südfriedhof.
A street in southwest Leipzig, Kurt-Kresse-Straße, was named after him in August 1945. A sporting field in Leipzig, Kurt-Kresse-Kampfbahn, also bears his name.

Penola Conservation Park

Penola Conservation Park (formerly the Penola National Park) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Monbulla about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about west of the town of Penola.
The conservation park occupies land in sections 255 and 256 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Monbulla. It is bounded by roads on three sides - Clay Wells Road (also known as the Robe - Penola road) to the south, Searle Road to the east and Rifle Range Road to the west. A wetland called Green Swamp located in its south-west was described in 1990 as “a semi-permanent wetland of approximately ” while in its south-east corner, there is a “small disused quarry.” 
It originally acquired protected area status as one of two parcels of land proclaimed as a fauna sanctuary on 19 February 1970 under the "Fauna Conservation Act 1964-1965" with the other parcel being located in the Hundred of Penola. On 10 September 1970, Sections 255 and 256 in the Hundred of Monbulla were proclaimed under the "National Parks Act 1966" as the "Penola National Park". On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the "Penola Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" which repealed both of the above-mentioned acts along with other statutes concerned with conservation. The land was reported in 1990 as being previously used for grazing on the basis of the condition of the vegetation and the presence of a well at the edge of the Green Swamp. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons:
A fine reserve preserving a range of habitat types representative of the stranded dune and swale terrain of the lower south-east of South Australia. The Park incorporates both dune and swale with associated seasonal swamp. "Macropus rufogriseus", "Trichosurus vulpecula", "Tachylglossus aculeatus" and "Rattus leutreolus". The diverse avifauna is augmented by a winter influx of waterbirds.
In 1990, the conservation park was described as follows:…underlain by consolidated calcarenite dunes, overlain with red, weakly structured sandy soils and unconsolidated stranded dunes of bleached sands with a yellow-grey B horizon. Two large wetland areas have a marl base and black organic soils. River red gum flats have sandy, mottled-yellow duplex soil.
In 1990, the following vegetation associations were present:
As of 1990, visitation consisted of use “mainly by local residents and schools groups” and “occasional” use for “bush camping.”
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Media diving

Media diving is underwater diving in support of the media industries, including the practice of underwater photography and underwater cinematography outside of normal recreational interests. Media diving is often carried out in support of television documentaries, such as the BBC series Planet Earth or movies, with feature films such as Titanic and The Perfect Storm featuring underwater photography or footage. Media divers are normally highly skilled camera operators who use diving as a method to reach their workplace, although some underwater photographers start as recreational divers and move on to make a living from their hobby.
Equipment in this field is varied with scuba and surface supplied equipment used, depending on requirements, but rebreathers are often used for wildlife related work as they are normally quiet, release few or no bubbles and allow the diver a lengthy bottom time with a reduced risk of frightening off the subject.
Applications and scope of work.
Media diving is professional underwater photography and filming, and related underwater work, often in support of television documentaries or films with underwater footage. Media divers are likely to be skilled camera operators who trained as divers to expand the scope of their operations, though some have started as recreational divers and later turned professional.
Media divers are the diving personnel who are employed or contracted in support of underwater media work, and include photographers, camera operators, sound and lighting technicians, journalists and presenters. They are not the divers who may be needed to prepare the underwater location using engineering and construction skills and equipment, or the use of explosives, which is classified as commercial diving work. In jurisdictions where media diving is considered commercial diving work this distinction falls away, but the code of practice to be followed may still differ according to the actual work of the dive. 
The media diver will prepare, clean, and maintain recording equipment such as high definition video cameras in underwater housings, with special underwater lighting, and remote cameras, plan and research dives and expeditions, dive, and shoot footage. Additional tasks commonly include maintaining generators, compressors, diving gear, boats and other diving support equipment. Rebreather skills may be necessary to reduce the impact of diver presence on wildlife, as open circuit scuba is noisy. Remotely operated underwater vehicles may be used for access to depths beyond those accessible to divers.
A safety diver is required whenever performers are in the water or the action requires performers to fall into the water.
Qualification and registration.
The qualifications legally required for media diving vary considerably across the world. In some jurisdictions the occupation is simply considered to be an aspect of professional diving, and as it is an activity of employment, the practice falls under occupational health and safety legislation. In other countries there is no legislation specifying requirements.
The UK HSE recognises the risks associated with media diving by issuing a code of practice for media diving, and requires media divers to have an approved qualification appropriate to the specific equipment to be used during an operation.
The requirements for actors and performers taking part in a recording session or live performance may differ from those for media divers, and may include recreational diving certification, for example to EN 14153-3/ISO 24801-3 Level 3 "Dive Leader" In such operations the performers may not be included as part of the diving team for safety purposes.
Procedural requirements.
As is the case for other professional diving, the diving contractor may be required to keep an operations logbook in which certain information on the diving operation is recorded. Such information would usually include details of the diving contractor, the members of the dive team, the site location, water and weather conditions, the dive profile, the purpose of the dive, equipment used, and any reportable incidents that may have occurred during the dive. A diving project plan will be drawn up by the diving contractor based on information provided by the client, and will include a risk assessment and a detailed plan for the diving operations.

Louis-Armand Chardin

Louis-Armand Chardin, called Chardiny (1755 – 1 October 1793) was an 18th-century French composer.
Biography.
Born in Fécamp, Chardin made his debut at the Paris opera in 1780 as baritone and was finally received the following year. He stood out for the beauty of his voice and the purity of his singing. Nevertheless, he acted coldly and never knew how to enliven the stage. The role which made him most honoured was that of Theseus in "Œdipe à Colone".
Chardin was a composer, and we know of him several small operas that he wrote for the , such as: "le Pouvoir de la nature", in one act, 1786; "la Ruse d’amour", in one act, 1786; "le Clavecin", 1787; "Clitandre et Céphise", 1788. In 1787 he had "l’Anneau perdu et retrouvé" performed at the Comédie-Italienne. He is also known for the music of a melodrama entitled: "Annette et Basile".
Chardin was one of the first to set music to Florian's romances "Estelle" and "Galatée". His oratorio "Retour de Tobie" was given at the Concert spirituel the same year. Chardin wrote the recitatives of Paisiello's "Le Roi Théodore à Venise", when this work, translated by Moline, was performed at the Opera on 11 September 1787.
It is also necessary to add to the list of his dramatic productions "l'Amant sculpteur", opéra comique in one act which was performed at the Théâtre-comique et lyrique in 1790. When in 1792, Piis and Barré established the Théâtre du Vaudeville, they hired Chardin as a "teacher" of their young artists, and as a composer and arranger of the music for their plays. This job did not prevent Chardin from continuing to be part of the Opera staff, but it did give him the ability to place a relative, perhaps his brother, J. Chardin, in the orchestra of Vaudeville, where he played the cello parts.
Having warmly embraced the party of the Revolution, Chardin was captain of an armed company of the when he died at age thirty-seven.
Five days after his death, the vaudevillist Piis sent these verses about Chardin to the "Journal des Spectacles" :

Christa Luft

Christa Luft (born Christa Hecht: 22 February 1938) is a German economist and politician of the SED/PDS. 
Luft joined the SED in 1958. From 18 November 1989 to 18 March 1990 she was economy minister in the Modrow government. From 1994 to 2002 she was member of the Bundestag for the PDS.
From 1963 to 1971 Luft was registered as a Stasi informant under the code name "IM Gisela".
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Christa Hecht was born into a working-class family at Krakow am See, a small market town in the flat countryside to the south of Rostock in northern central Germany. Her father worked as a master machinist. at the VEB Mathias-Thesen-Werft Wismar ship building business in Wismar. Her mother was in charge of a schools kitchen. Her father was away for years at a time during the war, but after 1944 he came safely home, and while she was still small the family moved to Wismar in connection with her father's work. She attended junior school in Bobitz between 1945 and 1952, and then at Grevesmühlen, still in the Rostock area. Like most of her contemporaries, she joined the Free German Youth ("Freie Deutsche Jugend)" / FDJ) in 1952, remaining a member till 1964.
Shortly before the end of her penultimate year at secondary school she was one of four students – two boys and two girls – picked out by the school director to complete her schooling at the prestigious attached to Halle University in the central part of what had become, in October 1949, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany -) formerly the Soviet Occupation Zone). Her selection held out the possibility of the chance to travel abroad in the future – which in the context of the time and place meant the Soviet Union or the other fraternal socialist member states of the recently launched Warsaw Pact. It was to facilitate the possibility of international exchange that at Halle much of the teaching took place not in German but in Russian. She was also required to attend an interview before arrangements could be finalised, which from a western perspective seems to have been intended to verify her "political reliability". She was able to confirm that she had no close relatives beyond the increasingly impenetrable "inner frontier" in "the other Germany", and knew to keep her indignation to herself when asked almost casually how she felt about the church. Inwardly she thought the matter was none of the business of her interviewers, but the reply she gave, as she would recall it many years later, was restricted to the observation that she enjoyed listening to organ concerts. Before agreeing to the move she had obtained her parents' advice on it, and during her time at Halle she used to return home on the train to the north of the country regularly. She would later tell an interviewer that early on she nurtured ambitions of working in Veterinary medicine, but during her time at Halle it became clear that this was not an option: her ambition and enthusiasm switched to Economics, albeit always with a special focus on foreign trade. Passing her Abitur (school final exams) as a student at the Workers' and Peasants' Faculty in 1956 opened the way to university level education, and she enrolled as a student at the College of Foreign Trade ("Hochschule für Außenhandel") in Berlin-Slaken, then moving on to the at Berlin-Karlshorst where her teachers included , and from where she emerged in 1960 with a degree in Economics.
Staying on at the Berlin Economics College ("Hochschule für Ökonomie Berlin" / HfÖ).
Following her graduation she stayed on at the HfÖ as a research assistant, working for her doctorate which she received in 1964. Her doctoral dissertation concerned "The key influences of socialist international division of labour and foreign trade on the beneficial impact for societal labour (investigated using an East German example)" (" Die wesentlichen Einflüsse der sozialistischen internationalen Arbeitsteilung und des Außenhandels auf den Nutzeffekt gesellschaftlicher Arbeit (untersucht am Beispiel der Empfängerröhrenindustrie der DDR)"). Her supervisors were Gertrud Gräbig and . Between 1964 and 1968 she stayed at the HfÖ as an academic employee, with co-responsibility for creating a new academic discipline, that of "socialist foreign trade" ("Leitung des sozialistischen Außenhandels"), under the direction of , the founding director back in 1954 of the "Foreign Trade Academy" ("Hochschule für Außenhandel") and co-chairman (from the East German side) of the Committee for . She travelled to the west with this working group in 1966 for a study visit to the heavy-industry conglomerate in Essen: they also visited Bremen for a meeting with Carl Katz, the co-chairman (from the West German side) of the Committee for . In 1968 Luft received her habilitation, a higher academic qualification which would have opened the way to a full-time academic career, though her own career trajectory would include a parallel political channel. Her lengthily entitled dissertation again addressed the interface between political socialism and foreign trade ("Zur bewussten Ausnutzung der dialektischen Einheit ökonomischer und psychologischer Marktfaktoren beim Export der DDR nach dem sozialistischen Wirtschaftsgebiet sowie nach kapitalistischen Industrie- und Entwicklungsländern – Das Wesen der Verkaufspsychologie im sozialistischen Außenhandel"). Her habilitation was supervised by Gertrud Gräbig and Horst Tiedtke. Remaining at the , in 1968 Luft received a in the newly developed academic discipline, "socialist foreign trade" ("Leitung des sozialistischen Außenhandels").
Between 1967 and 1970 she worked as assistant dean ("Prodekanin") for at the Foreign Trade faculty. In 1971 she accepted a full professorship in Socialist Foreign Economics ("für sozialistische Außenwirtschaft ") the HfÖ. Between 1973 and 1977 she served as director of the Socialist Foreign Economics section. She was also a regular visitor to "the Academy for Foreign Trade and Tourism "("Hochschule für Außenhandel und Touristik") at Maribor, a city in the northern part of what was at that time known as Yugoslavia. She held a guest professorship at the academy in Maribor which was a partner institution of the . Between 1978 and 1981 she was a deputy director of the "International Institute for the Economic Problems of the Socialist World System" ("Internationalen Instituts für ökonomische Probleme des sozialistischen Weltsystems") attached to the Moscow-controlled Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ("Совет экономической взаимопомощи" / Comecon). She was able to build on her contacts with comrade-academics from other socialist countries, representing The Institute at international gatherings and at conferences organised by the United Nations in Geneva and New York City. After returning the German Democratic Republic, between 1982 and 1987, she again served as dean in the Foreign Economics section at the HfÖ. With the Soviet Union investing heavily in modernising its own engineering and heavy industry sectors, the traditionally complementary economic relationship between the Soviet Union and East Germany was becoming more overtly competitive, and economic pressures were forcing the East German government to try and diversify its trading relationships. As a representative of the largest Economics teaching and research institution in the German Democratic Republic, Luft participated during this time in a succession of international congresses at which she made presentations: venues included Athens, Madrid and New Delhi. From 1985 Christa Luft was involved in setting up regular one and two term study visits for HfÖ students of Foreign Economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business ("Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien "). She also initiated a collaboration programme with East European specialists at the Sorbonne (university) in Paris. Out of this there emerged a series of bilateral in Paris, Lyon and Berlin. In 1987 Christa Luft was appointed a corresponding member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences.
By 1988 the HfÖ in Berlin-Karlshorst had been renamed as the . On 28 October of that year Christa Luft was appointed rector of the institution which had by this time been the focus of her professional and academic life for three decades. The accelerating pace of social and political changes over the next year would mean that she stayed in post for slightly more than one year.
National politics.
In 1989 Christa Luft entered politics at a time of national transition. Between 18 November 1989 and 18 March 1990 she served as first of the three vice-chair of the East German Ministerial Council and as Minister of Economics in the Modrow government. During this time she participated alongside Hans Modrow, in January 1990, in the final Comecon meeting. The meeting was held in Sofia and made the important decision to migrate member states towards a system of trade based on freely convertible currencies, and thereby implicitly put an end to the system of fixed exchange rates within the Eastern bloc. Less than a month later she was in Bonn taking part on the first and last joint cabinet meeting between the East and West German governments, again discussing currency exchange rates, this time between East and West Germany. (There was still little appreciation of the speed with which reunification could and would take place later that same year.) The first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair general election ever held in East Germany took place on 18 March 1990. One result of the new approach was that the Socialist Unity Party ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" / SED), struggling to reinvent itself for a democratic future as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), received only 66 of the 400 seats in the national parliament ("Volkskammer"). It was the first time since the foundation of the German Democratic Republic back in October 1949 that the SED) and its proxies had not commanded a comfortable majority in the chamber. Christa Luft was one of the 66 SED/PDS members, elected for the Karl-Marx-Stadt (previously and subsequently Chemnitz) electoral district. She served as chair of the parliamentary budget committee. Nevertheless, with her party excluded from the governing coalition under Prime Minister Lothar de Maizière, she no longer held ministerial office. The Economics Ministry now went to Gerhard Pohl of the centre-right CDU party.
During her time as a national politician Christa Luft retained her links with the , in charge of the "East European Economics" ("Osteuropawirtschaft") teaching chair till 1 October 1991, which was when the Berlin senate, a couple of days ahead of reunification, closed down the entire institution.
After reunification.
Between 1 October 1991 and 31 October 1994 Luft was a member of the governing executive and a lecturer at the "Berlin Institute for International Education" ("Institut für Internationale Bildung Berlin e.V.") of which she was a co-founder. The focus was to educate a generation Russian speaking economics experts from Russia and the surrounding post-Soviet successor states, especially from Bulgaria and also from China. During this time she accepted a number of invitations to appear as a guest lecturer on the East German experience of political and economic transformation. Within Europe she delivered such presentations at St. Gallen, Mülheim an der Ruhr and the Free University of Berlin. Farther afield she also shared her insights in China and in Vietnam.
As part of the unification process 144 members of the East German Volkskammer, including 24 of the PDS members, transferred to the enlarged Bundestag of a reunited Germany. Christa Luft was not one of them. However, she stood for election in the 1994, when the PDS experienced a modest recovery, increasing the number of its seats from 17 to 30. Luft's candidacy, which was as a "directly elected" member for the , was successful, with 44.4% of the first preference votes: between 1994 and 2002 she served as a PDS member of the Bundestag. Between 1998 and 2002 she served as chair of the PDS group in the chamber and as the party's parliamentary spokesperson on Economics and budgetary matters.
Later years.
Christa Luft regularly wrote a column on politics and economics in Neues Deutschland between 2002 and 2012, in a feature that also included regular contributions from Harry Nick, Robert Kurz and Rudolf Hickel. She remains engaged as a commentator and author.
Memberships.
Christa Luft has been a member of the Learned since 1993. She is a member of the and of the . She was the first chairperson of the OWUS.
Between 2002 and 2008 Christa Luft chaired the ("loosely, "board of trustees"") of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation. For the subsequent five years, till 2013, she was an elected member of the foundation's executive committee.
Stasi shadows.
During her time as a member of the East German parliament ("Volkskammer") at the end of 1989 Luft volunteered to undergo a check to see whether and how she might feature in the surviving Ministry for State Security (Stasi) files. Nothing incriminatory was identified. Luft herself had denied having had any contact with the security services. At this stage there was little appreciation of the size of the Stasi operation nor of the extent to which – despite desperate attempts during the final days of the communist régime to burn the evidence – detailed records of Stasi activities over the previous forty years had survived. Subsequently, after further delving in the Stasi archives revealed that back in 1963, when she was 25, she had signed an undertaking to provide unspecified items of information to the authorities, she stated that she had no recollection of the matter ("Daran erinnere ich mich nicht"). During the early 1990s Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski disclosed to (West) German intelligence that Christa Luft had had links with the HVA The HVA was the department of the Ministry for State Security that dealt with "foreign" intelligence. In reality it had concentrated on West Germany. Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski was a senior politician and trade official with Stasi connections in East Germany. He provided a large amount of information to western intelligence after the collapse of East German's power structure/ He said that Luft had been handled by a Stasi officer known as Manfred Süß, but this turned out to be incorrect.
Luft was a member of the Bundestag between 1994 and 2002: the nature and extent of any past associations she might have had with the Stasi were naturally of interest to the parliamentary authorities. An investigation by the resulted in a careful and detailed report which was published in June 1998. It was established that between 1963 and 1971 Christa Luft had been registered under the cover name "IM Gisela" in connection with an operation undertaken by the Stasi's Main Directorate for Reconnaissance ("Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung" / HVA) section. She had been recruited shortly before receiving her doctorate. On 31 October 1963 she had signed a handwritten "declaration of obligation" statement, of the kind frequently used for informants (" inoffizieller Mitarbeiter") recruited by the Stasi. Later in 1963 she had delivered several (three) "background reports in support of the unmasking of an alleged western spy. However, this was only a 'dummy case' case, used to test her reliability". Luft never denied the existence of the assignment, although her recollections of it, at a detailed level, were differently nuanced:
The reported in addition that Luft had declared herself, "from 1965, prepared to act as a 'cover address' for receiving postal items on behalf of the Mfs. From the available papers [the enquiry could find no sign that] she ever actually had forwarded anything to them", however. They thought she had probably contributed by identifying people who might be recruited for MfS "operational work". The enquiry reported that "from the middle of 1966 till 1971, the point of formal termination on Stasi operations in connection with "IM Gisela", no documents had been provided evidencing "IM activity" by Luft.
By 1995 the had been archived and citizens had a statutory right to access them, whether for purposes of academic research or simply to understand what personal information the East German security services had held on their movements and contacts. In June 1995 Christa Luft made a personal application to the Gauck Commission (as the relevant agency was then known) to try and find out what information the Stasis had held on her. In respect of her "IM Gisela" cover name there were no significant surprises. However, she was unnerved to find out that in 1977 the security services had launched a surveillance operation ("Operative Personenkontrolle" / OPK) against her. Luft's work had given her far more access to foreigners than most East German citizens, and there had been concerns that she might betray state secrets to the West German intelligence services. She was particularly troubled to learn that in 1977 the security services had arranged to obtain a duplicate key to her apartment. The key had remained in the hands of the Stasi till the organisation dissolved in 1990. After that it had been handed over to the Stasi Records Agency with all the other papers. Luft was indignant that no one from the records agency had bothered to tell her that they were holding a copy of her front door key.

The Transposed Heads

The Transposed Heads (original German title ) is a novella by Thomas Mann. It was written in 1940 and published later that year by Bermann-Fischer. The English translation by H. T. Lowe-Porter was published in 1941 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was one of Mann's last novellas, followed only by "The Tables of the Law" in 1944 and "The Black Swan" in 1954. Set in India, the story is a jocular retelling of an ancient folk legend.
Background and themes.
Mann subtitled the novella "An Indian Legend". He was inspired to write it after reading a book on the Indian goddess Kali by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer in which Zimmer recounted the old folk tale which became the basis of "The Transposed Heads". Mann began writing it in January 1940 and finished in August of that year. He dedicated the published work to Zimmer adding the words "Returned with thanks". Both its setting and its source marked a unique departure from Mann's oeuvre. He described it as his "first approach to the French surrealist sphere", an oblique reference to the work of Jean Cocteau whom Mann knew through Cocteau's friendship with his son Klaus. Although the tale is a tragic one, Mann recounts it in a tongue-in-cheek style.
According to Jens Rieckmann, despite its exotic setting, the themes of "The Transposed Heads"—"sensuality, metaphysics, entangled identities, and the problem of love and individuality"—were central to Mann's work. Another theme in the story is the "femme fatale" archetype that can also be seen in several of Mann's works, including "Little Herr Friedemann" and Castorp's nightmarish visions of female cannibals in "The Magic Mountain". Sita, the central female character of "The Transposed Heads", is a seemingly innocent girl who causes the death of both the men who love her. She becomes a human manifestation of Kali, the goddess of time and creation but also of destruction.
Plot.
Shridaman and Nanda are two young friends who are "little different in age and in caste, but very unlike in body." Shridaman is a learned merchant with strong spiritual qualities and a noble face but a thin, weedy body. Nanda is a blacksmith with a strong and beautiful body but a rather ordinary intellect. Both fall in love with Sita, the daughter of a cattle-breeder. She accepts Shridaman's proposal of marriage but shortly after their wedding, she begins to wonder if she had made the wrong choice. Matters are not helped by the fact that Nanda has remained Shridaman's friend and is a frequent visitor to their house. Soon, both Nanda and Shridaman become aware of what is happening.
Six months after the wedding and with Sita pregnant with Shridaman's child, they set off to visit her parents accompanied by Nanda. On the way they stop at a temple to the goddess Kali where Shridaman goes in to pray. In a fit of religious fervor he beheads himself to free Sita to marry Nanda. Nanda then enters the temple and when he finds Shridaman's corpse, he likewise beheads himself. On discovering what has happened, Sita is about to hang herself when Kali appears. She tells Sita to place the heads back on the bodies and she will bring them back to life. However, in her grief and confusion Sita had placed Nanda's head on Shridaman's body and vice versa. Each man now retains his original identity but has a new body.
At first the situation seems to be going well. Sita gives birth to Samadhi, a lovable child with very poor eyesight who is nicknamed "Andhaka" ("Little blind boy"). Shridaman is pleased to have a perfect body and Nanda is pleased to have the body that has fathered Sita's child. He is also pleased that Sita is having sex with his former body. Nevertheless, they decide to consult the wise man Kamadamana as to which of the two men is actually her husband. He determines that it is the one with the head of Shridaman. In his disappointment, Nanda becomes a religious recluse.
Four years have passed. While Shridaman is away on business, Sita takes her son to visit Nanda and show him the child his new body had generated. Sita and Nanda are overwhelmed by passion. On returning to an empty house, Shridaman sets off to find Nanda and Sita. He proposes to them the only solution for a situation where a woman is simultaneously in love with one man's body and another man's head. The two men are to commit suicide, and Sita is to die a ritual death on her husband's funeral pyre. This duly happens with little Samadhi-Andhaka lighting the flames.

Book of Demons

Book of Demons is an isometric hack and slash game with elements of action role-playing created by Polish studio Thing Trunk. The game was officially released through Steam on 13 December 2018. The game was originally developed for Microsoft Windows, but the developers informed about plans to release it also on Xbox One. "Book of Demons" is the first installment of the "Return 2 Games" series that aims to bring classic hardcore genres to broader audiences. The game features an unusual art style - all elements of the game (starting from the GUI and ending with monsters) are visualised as papercuttings and pop-up book elements, and such style defines visual framework for the whole series. The game also brings some novelties to the genre - the card system which replaces equipment and skills systems typical for the genre, the "Flexiscope" feature which allows players to control duration of a game session and movement restricted to a path which add a tactical element to the gameplay.
World and plot.
The world created in the game relates to the classics of hack and slash genre. The action takes place in the Paperverse, more specifically in the dungeons beneath the cathedral standing in Town. In the depths of the maze under the cathedral, a new evil has awakened and threatens the lives of the locals. Their only hope is the help of a wandering hero, the player's character, who starts the crusade against the Ultimate Evil.
In the dungeons player meets most of the monsters typical for games set in dark fantasy settings - ghosts, spiders, goatmen, demons, skeletons, zombies and gargoyles. Above the ground, in the Town, the player can interact with four citizens - the Sage, the Fortune-Teller, the Barmaid and the Healer, who build the story of the game through rumours. Citizens of the Town also provide various services:
Classes.
In "Book of Demons" players can choose from three classes, each characterized by a different playstyle and set of class cards.
Card system.
The card system is a uniquely implemented mechanic in the hack and slash genre. It replaces skills, statistics and equipment. In "Book of Demons" the player can choose from three types of cards and then build their own hand:
Every card has three variants (common, magic offering one additional effect, and legendary with two additional effects with one unique to that card) and can be upgraded up to two times.
Development.
The development of the game started with the establishment of the Thing Trunk studio and initially only the founders of the company (earlier co-funders of Codeminion and Twin Bottles) participated in the project. "Book of Demons" was meant to be a light and humoristic tribute to classic games from the hack and slash genre made in the '90s. The game is created in CUG - an in-house engine of Thing Trunk's focused mainly on 2D graphics. In the second half of 2016, the project entered Early Access stage and at the end of this year, the developers released a free demo of the game. At the beginning of 2018, the team of developers consisted of 7 employees. The game was officially released on Steam on 13 December 2018. The game was released on Nintendo Switch on 30 April 2020. and on May 21, 2020 in Japan.
Reception.
Critics refer to the game cautiously, refraining from reviews until the release date, however there are some opinions already - Khee Hoon Chan ("Unwinnable") commend the game for flexibility in terms of progression and possible play styles, mentioning also that removing the statistics mechanics denies players the opportunity to immerse with their heroes more deeply. "GameSpot" reviewer, Rafał Kurpiewski ("Polygamia.pl)" and Szymon Liebert ("TVGry)" admit that even though the game is heavily inspired on old hack and slash games there is still a lot of originality in it to refresh the genre (citing cards system, restriction of movement and boss mechanics), while noting similarities in stories told in "Book of Demons" and "Diablo" games.
