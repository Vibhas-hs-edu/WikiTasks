Marriage in Myanmar

In the nation of Myanmar (Burma), certain customs are associated with the institution of marriage.
Selecting a partner.
Most Burmese people find their own life partner, but sometimes they may have an arranged marriage conducted by their parents or a middleman. If the parents do not support the couple, they may get married in secret then after some time the parents might accept their marriage. Traditionally, when a man goes to ask a woman's parents to bless their marriage, he brings a gift to his future wife.
There are many superstitions regarding marriage in Myanmar. Tradition holds that those born on particular combinations of days of the week are not right for each other. For example: those born on Saturday would not be suitable for those born on Thursday. Likewise, Friday and Monday, Sunday and Wednesday, and Wednesday evening and Tuesday are all poor matches. If the couple is poorly matched, they will go to an astrologer and ask for help to avoid future difficulties. Astrologers also advise on the date and time of the ceremony, and the color of the wedding dress.
Polygyny is illegal in Myanmar.
Preparation.
The first step to a proper engagement is for the bride and groom's parents and chosen elders to be formally and publicly introduced at the bride's home or a public venue. During that time, both sides will discuss the details of the wedding. However close they are, the families will formally negotiate about the wedding.
During the engagement celebration, the groom's family offers coconut, banana, and pickled tea leaves on a tray to the bride's family home for the household nat (spirit).
Wedding.
Historically, marriages could be announced to the public by letting people from seven houses on either side of the wedded couple's house know about it. Nowadays, people prefer to celebrate their wedding ceremony impressively among their community. Some couples sign the marriage certificate at a courthouse and some invite a judge to their home. Generally, monks are invited to home in rural areas. In metropolitan areas, families go monasteries. The couple offers food to the monks and listen to a sermon.
The best months to celebrate the wedding ceremony are April, May, June, October, November, and February. If a couple marries during these months, tradition holds that they will have a prosperous and long-lasting relationship. Couples try to avoid marrying during Buddhist Lent, from July to September.
The married state.
After marriage, a couple may live with their in-laws for a short time or for a lifetime. Household chores are carried out by women.
Husbands are traditionally “rice winners”; however, wives manage the family income. Sometimes wives supplement their husband's income by running a house-store, dress-making or selling something. When a Burmese woman marries, she does not need to transfer her property to her husband.
Divorce and death.
According to the United Nations Population Fund, divorce rates in Myanmar are low: 3 per cent of women and 2 per cent of men are divorced or separated. If a married woman divorces, she can keep what she has brought to the marriage. When a husband dies, everything he owns goes to his wife. Only after she dies does the property go to the children.

San Potito, Naples

San Potito is a church in Naples dedicated to Potitus, who was tortured to death in Epirus or Ascoli in 166. It is located on the San Potito hill on via Tommaso Salvatori.
It was built in the first half of the 17th century in the Mannerist style to plans by Pietro de Marino. It was intended as the monastery church for a community of Benedictines which had initially been founded as Basilians. The monastery buildings were restored in 1780. During the French invasion of Italy the monastery's lands and goods were confiscated and the monks expelled in 1809 under Joachim Murat, with some of them moving into the church of San Gregorio Armeno. The monastery buildings were turned into infantry barracks and later carabinieri barracks. The church is still deconsecrated and closed to the public.
It has a single nave with three chapels on each side. The interior is richly decorated with stucco, though its main features are its 18th-century high altar. The high altarpiece is surmounted by three paintings - Niccolò de Simone's 1654 "Saint Potitus pierced by a burning nail making the emperor Antoninus share his pain", flanked by Giacinto Diano's 1784 "Saint Potitus felling an idol" and "Saint Potitus curing the madness of Antoninus' daughter Agnes". Diano also painted a 1791 depiction of the "Immaculate Conception" in the third chapel on the right, whilst in the first chapel on the right is Luca Giordano's 1663-65 "Our Lady of the Rosary". A 17th-century Calvary is in the first chapel on the left, the second chapel on the left has stucco depicting Saint Cajetan and the third chapel on the left has a painting of "Our Lady with Saints Antony the Great and Roch" by Andrea Vaccaro. The sacristy contains two paintings by Pacecco de Rosa and Domenico Mondo.

Deiveson Figueiredo

Deiveson Alcântara Figueiredo (born December 18, 1987) is a Brazilian professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Flyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former UFC Flyweight Champion. As of June 14, 2021, he is #1 in the UFC flyweight rankings.
Background.
Figueiredo was born in Soure, Pará, Brazil, a small city on the isle of Marajó where buffaloes roam freely. His father was a buffalo herder who practiced "luta marajoara", a local folk wrestling style. Deiveson has a younger sister and a brother – Francisco – who also is a professional mixed martial artist signed with the UFC. He was a cowboy, working with his father at an animal farm until he was thirteen years old. Around the age of nine, he followed his father's footsteps and began wrestling. He moved to Belem to attend high school and started training in capoeira. He started training MMA after he met Iuri Marajo at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name="sportv.globo.com 2017/05"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixed martial arts career.
Early career.
Figueiredo made his professional debut in February 2012 against a fellow debutante Aluisio Ferreira. He won the fight by first-round submission. In his next six fights, Figueiredo fought in the Pará and Maranhão MMA circuits, mostly against debuting fighters, with David Silva and Joel Silva being the notable exceptions.
In late 2014, Deiveson signed with Jungle Fight, and was scheduled to make his first appearance with the organization at Jungle Fight 75 against Rayner Silva. Figueiredo won the fight by a second round TKO.
He was then scheduled to fight Jefte Brilhante during Revelation FC 3, but the bout was later cancelled. He was scheduled to fight Henrique Souza during Revelation FC 4, but the fight was likewise later cancelled.
Figueiredo was scheduled to fight Antônio de Miranda during Jungle Fight 87, following a seventeen-month break from the sport. He defeated de Miranda by submission mid-way through the first round. He fought again four months later, during Jungle Fight 90, against the undefeated Denis Oliveira. He defeated Oliveira by a first-round knockout.
Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Figueiredo made his promotional debut on June 3, 2017 at UFC 212, facing Marco Beltran. He won the fight via technical knockout by corner stoppage after round two.
His next fight came on October 28, 2017 at against Jarred Brooks. He won the fight via split decision.
On February 3, 2018 Figueiredo faced Joseph Morales at . He won the fight via technical knockout in round two.
Figueiredo faced John Moraga on August 25, 2018 at UFC Fight Night 135. He won the fight via technical knockout 3:08 into the second round.
Figueiredo was expected to face Joseph Benavidez on January 19, 2019 at UFC Fight Night 143. However the promotion clarified plans indicating that the pairing was off and that Figueiredo would be rescheduled for a separate event.
Figueiredo faced Jussier Formiga on March 23, 2019 at UFC Fight Night 148. He lost the fight via unanimous decision, thus resulting in Figueiredo's first professional loss.
Figueiredo faced Alexandre Pantoja on July 27, 2019 at UFC 240. He won the fight via unanimous decision. This fight earned him the "Fight of the Night" award.
Figueiredo faced Tim Elliott on October 12, 2019 at UFC on ESPN+ 19. He won the fight via submission in the first round.
UFC Flyweight Champion.
Figueiredo faced Joseph Benavidez for the vacant UFC Flyweight Championship at UFC on ESPN+ 27 on February 29, 2020. At the weigh-in, Figueiredo weighed in at 127.5 pounds, 2.5 pounds over the title fight limit. As a result, Figueiredo forfeited 30 percent of his purse to Benavidez and wasn't eligible to win the UFC Flyweight championship. He won the fight via TKO in round two. Coming into the fight with Benavidez, Figueiredo had to cut . He reportedly suffered from kidney and stomach pains when his team decided to stop cutting weight. Figueiredo stated he would like to give Joseph Benavidez his rematch because Benavidez gave him the opportunity to fight when he missed weight ahead of their fight.
Figueiredo rematched with Joseph Benavidez for the vacant UFC Flyweight Championship at UFC Fight Night 172 on July 19, 2020. On July 11, 2020, Figueiredo tested positive for COVID-19. According to his manager, the bout was not yet officially removed and Figueiredo was administered a second COVID-19 test on July 12, 2020 where the result would be back on July 13, 2020 to determined if Figueiredo was free to fight. Figueiredo passed multiple COVID-19 tests, clearing him to fight in the main event. Figueiredo won the fight via a technical submission in the first round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award.
As the first fight of his new six-fight contract with the UFC, Figueiredo was scheduled to make his first title defense against former UFC Bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt on November 21, 2020 at UFC 255. However, it was reported on October 2, 2020 that Garbrandt had torn his bicep and was forced to pull out of the contest. Figueiredo instead made his first title defense against Alex Perez. He won the fight via guillotine choke submission in round one.
After a successful defence of his title at UFC 255, Figueiredo faced Brandon Moreno at UFC 256. This was the UFC's fastest championship turnaround, at 21 days. After five rounds of back-and-forth fighting, the fight was declared a majority draw. Figueiredo had a point taken from him by referee Jason Herzog in the 3rd round for a low blow: the foul proved crucial as it turned two 48-47 scorecards in his favor into even 47-47 decisions, with the third judge seeing the fight 48-46 for the champion. Both men won the" Fight of the Night" award.
Figueiredo then faced Moreno in a rematch on June 12, 2021 at UFC 263. He lost the bout and the title via a rear naked choke submission in round three.
A trilogy bout with Moreno for the UFC Flyweight Championship is scheduled on December 11, 2021 at UFC 269.
Personal life.
Figueiredo worked as a bricklayer, hairdresser, and sushi chef before competing in MMA professionally. He purchased a pet water buffalo bull using some of his early MMA purses, which he has named Ferdinand.
Following a stint at Team Alpha Male, Deiveson returned to his native Brazil and founded Team Figueiredo gym in Belém.

Pietro de Marino (died 1673, Naples) was an Italian architect born in Naples and active there between 1629 and 1666. His works include the former church of San Potito.
Life.
He began his career as a collaborator of Bartolomeo Picchiatti. Between 1643 and 1654, he worked for the group of oblates founded by sister Orsola Benincasa (1547-1618). The viceroy became his patron and in 1654 de Marino and the engineer Natale Longo jointly edited a book on cloister wall of the hermitage of the Certosa di San Martino.
He designed several churches in Naples, most notably that of Santa Maria di Montesanto - he designed its whole monastery complex, though the church's dome was built after his death by Dionisio Lazzari. He also designed the church of San Potito and its associated monastery, along with Santa Maria della Pace and the coffered ceiling of Santa Maria Regina Coeli. He and Giovanni Mozzetta restored San Pietro ad Aram. At the end of his life de Marino also designed Santi Bernardo e Margherita, though like Santa Maria della Pace this was largely rebuilt and reordered in the 18th century.

Canada and the United States have faced each other in the gold medal game of 5 of 6 Olympics, 18 of 19 IIHF Women's World Championships and 21 of 23 4 Nations Cups since the beginning of international play. Only a few of Canada's and the U.S.'s losses have been to teams outside their rivalry. 
After an American victory over Canada at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, the Canadian Olympic team won the next four gold medals over the USA (the exception being 2006 where Canada defeated Sweden for gold and USA defeated Finland for bronze) until 2018, when the USA ended a 20-year gold medal drought defeating Canada in a shootout.
However, at the World Championships, Canada won the first 8 straight gold medals from 1990 to 2004 but recently, the USA has dominated winning 9 of the last 11 World Championships, defeating Canada eight times (the exception being 2019 where the USA won gold defeating Finland, who upset Canada in their semi-final match). 
At the 4 Nations Cup, Canada and the USA have faced each other in every gold medal game (except 2001 when the USA withdrew due to the September 11 attacks and 2013 where Canada won gold defeating Finland and the USA won bronze defeating Sweden), with Canada winning 10 of the first 13 and the USA winning 6 of the last 10.
The longest win streak, 8 games, by the Americans was broken by Canada's win in the gold medal game of the 2002 Olympics.

<doc id="56637980" url="?curid=56637980" title="Asbestos bankruptcy trusts (United States)">
Asbestos bankruptcy trusts (United States)

Asbestos bankruptcy trusts are trusts established by firms that have filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to pay personal injury claims caused by exposure to asbestos. At least 56 such trusts were established from the mid-1970s to 2011.
Background.
As of 2017, at least 100 large companies had filed bankruptcy, at least in part, due to asbestos-related liability. Because of this, seeking compensation for asbestos victims often involves both litigation against solvent defendants and filing claims against asbestos bankruptcy trusts. The largest 26 of these trusts paid about 2.4 million claims totaling about $10.9 billion up to 2008.
Claims.
Product identification.
Typically an asbestos plaintiff is exposed to a mixture of products during a thirty year career in the building trades. It takes between twenty and fifty years from first exposure to the development of asbestos-caused cancer, so work histories, employment, military and social security records are used to help prove the plaintiff's exposure to various asbestos products throughout his or her career. Plaintiffs file suit or bring trust claims against all defendants whose products contributed to their disease or death. In a trial, the jury decides whether any or all defendants are liable and the value of the case. In the trust system, the bankruptcy courts use actuarial models to determine the trust's share of responsibility based on disease and occupation. Trusts pay only ten to thirty cents on the dollar of these predetermined shares. Thus, if a trust values a wrongful death claim at $100,000, the claimant receives between $10,000 and $30,000 because the manufacturer has declared bankruptcy. In no instance can a plaintiff recover more than the total value of his or her case since both tort and trust defendants have the right to recover any overpayment from those that have underpaid, which is by definition every trust.
Plaintiffs' lawyers generally are not concerned by such findings. Many plaintiffs' lawyers believe that focusing on solvent defendants is entirely appropriate given that they have a responsibility to maximize the compensation their clients receive. Many plaintiffs' attorneys also argued that defense lawyers had many ways to establish different theories of exposure. Theoretically, this could be done by examining ship logs, work histories, etc. They also note that all exposures are often identified if a case proceeds to verdict. There is usually no such full disclosure in settlements.
Delayed filings and failure to disclose.
Plaintiffs attorneys routinely delay filing claims against asbestos bankruptcy trusts in order to facilitate lawsuits against solvent defendants. This is done because such claims would necessarily dilute the liability of solvent defendants. Plaintiffs attorneys also routinely delay production of claim forms until the very last moment possible in order to prevent defendants from gather counter evidence and develop affirmative defenses. In recognition of the prejudice this causes defendants, courts often extend or reopen discovery when the failure to produce trust claims is exposed. In "Edwards" production of claim forms was delayed until two weeks before trial. In "Warfield" production was delayed until the night before the trial. In "Stoeckler" the defendants discovered that the plaintiff did not disclose trust claims only three days after the start of the trial. 
It is often argued that the undisclosed claims are not material because they were only "deferral claims" filed to toll the statute of limitations against trusts for which no liability has yet been discovered. In "Barnes &amp; Crisafi" the court determined that no such distinction could be made. Plaintiffs will also often say they don't know about claims filed by other law firms. In "Stoeckler", the plaintiff's lawyer denied any knowledge of multiple past trust claims. In response to such arguments judges will often adopt mandatory disclosure obligations for bankruptcy trust claims.
In the Garlock bankruptcy Judge Hodges found numerous instances of plaintiff counsel improperly withholding production of trust claims. Garlock was allowed to conduct discovery regarding fifteen plaintiffs represented by five different law firms; Garlock found failure to produce in each and every case. Plaintiffs produced 32 claims but failed to produce another 284 claims.
Payments by injury type.
The relatively high compensation received by claimants with non-malignant injuries has been an ongoing problem. Ten of the 26 known active trusts in 2008 report their payouts broken down by malignant and non-malignant injuries. During 2007 and 2008 combined, 86 percent of the claims these trusts reported were for non-malignant injuries. Non-malignant claims represented 37 percent of reported trust expenditures in these years.
Trustees, trust advisory committees, and future claimants' representatives.
Asbestos bankruptcy trust are governed by trustees who in turn are advised by trust advisory committees (TACs) and future claimants' representatives (FCRs). TACs are generally controlled by lawyers from a few prominent firms such as Baron &amp; Budd, P.C. and Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. Trusts must obtain the consent of TACs and FCRs before taking any major action.
Medicaid and Medicare fraud investigation.
In late 2016, attorneys general from 13 states sent demand letters to bankruptcy trusts for Armstrong World Industries, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, DII, and Owens Corning. The purpose of the demand letters was to determine if the funds are reimbursing states for medical treatment received under Medicaid and Medicare. The federal Medicare Secondary Payer law imposes penalties for paying settlements directly to claimants without repaying the government for medical costs covered under the same programs under the legal doctrine of subrogation. Possible penalties can include double damages. Plaintiff attorneys can be held liable under this law. Many private insurance companies that provide supplemental Medicare coverage have filed similar lawsuits. 
The same attorneys general filed suit in federal court in Utah to force discovery in early 2017. Defense counsel responded to the suit by arguing that the plaintiffs lack jurisdiction and that their requests are overbroad.
A judge dropped complaints from several states involved in the suit.

Repeated median regression

In robust statistics, repeated median regression, also known as the repeated median estimator, is a robust linear regression algorithm.
The estimator has a breakdown point of 50%. Although it is equivariant under scaling, or under linear transformations of either its explanatory variable or its response variable, it is not under affine transformations that combine both variables. It can be calculated in formula_1 time by brute force, in formula_2 time using more sophisticated techniques, or in formula_3 randomized expected time. It may also be calculated using an on-line algorithm with formula_4 update time.
Method.
The repeated median method estimates the slope of the regression line formula_5 for a set of points formula_6 as
where formula_8 is defined as formula_9.
The estimated Y-axis intercept is defined as
where formula_11 is defined as formula_12.

OBAC Odessa

Odessa British Athletic Club (In Russian: «Одесский британский атлетический клуб» ОБАК in short, meaning: Odessian British Athletic Club) was an earlier Imperial Russian athletic club from Odessa, which was established on 1878 by British workers of the Indo-European Telegraph Company who in 1877 moved from Kerch to Odessa.
History.
The city of Odessa was the biggest city of the Imperial Russian South-West (see, Southwestern Krai) and was a municipality (Gradonachalstvo, an Imperial Russian administrative unit of the same level as governorate (gubernia) and oblast). In 1877 to the city from Kerch moved the Indo-European Telegraph Company that employed many Brits (subjects of British Crown). In 1878 they organized the Odessa British Athletic Club (OBAC) which among other sports competitions cultivated the game of association football.
They played at the field located in a neighborhood of Malofontanskaya doroga (Little-fountain Road), not far from a sea shore. For a long time OBAC was composed exclusively out of English only and beside playing between themselves, they conducted annual meetings with footballers of the Romanian city of Galați.

Azerbaijan Customs History Museum

Azerbaijan Customs History Museum is a museum of State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan, located in Baku, Azerbaijan.
History.
The museum was established by the State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan on March 23, 2006, with order No. 034. The work on the establishment of the Azerbaijan Customs History Museum was completed on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the State Customs Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. On January 27, 2007, a section of the Museum of the History of Customs, the union of "Azerterminalcomplex" was opened.
In 2008 the Museum was accepted into the Azerbaijan National Committee of the International Council of Museums. Since September 2008 the museum is a member of the International Association of Customs Museums. In 2010, the "Azerterminalcomplex" section transformed into a branch of the Museum of Customs History. After confirmation from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan, the branch of the museum obtained its own fund and permanent exposition.
Exhibition.
Most of the museum's collection is arranged of cultural, scientific, historical and artistic cultural assets seized by customs officers and seized by the judicial authorities. From time to time most of these examples of art have been donated to museums, scientific institutions, and religious organizations, churches and mosques in Baku.
Exhibits of the Customs Museum are exhibited mainly in EU countries.
The collection of the museum is broadly focused on both thematic and regional aspects. The museum collection mainly consists of documents and photographs reflecting the customs history, as well as works of art created by various masters. The museum exhibition covers different periods, as well as exhibits exported for smuggling from Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan Customs History Museum, which exhibits various antique goods and other works of historical and artistic value, is evidence of the fight against smuggling of customs officials and serves as a sign of observance of national interests and moral values. Until 2006, customs officers were transferring all confiscated art objects to museums. Later they began to systematize the found antiques, which were tried to be exported abroad.
The collection of the branch of the Customs History Museum has a modern fine art department represented by painting, sculpture, art and crafts. The first millennium excavations, carpets, oriental sculptures, copper items, ancient coins, antique and ancient icons, jewelry, firearms, weapons of the 17th-19th centuries, Quran and Bible copies, that were confiscated while trying to be exported from Azerbaijan are kept in the department. This department was created by the joint efforts of the museum and the Union of Artists of Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan Customs History Museum exhibits confiscated historical and religious books, icons, other religious and religious rites and historical and cultural objects that have been confiscated as of today. For the first time, a museum was established by the State Customs Committee in 1999 for the transfer of religious books and icons confiscated by the Azerbaijani customs authorities in relevant religious assemblies.

Bartolomeo Picchiatti

Bartolomeo Picchiatti (Ferrara, 1571 – Naples, 3 April 1643) was an Italian engineer and architect. A short street in the Soccavo area of the city is named after him.
Life.
He moved to Naples in 1593, having been summoned by the architect Domenico Fontana to be his assistant. He assisted Domenico and Giulio Cesare Fontana in the completion of works left incomplete by Giulio on his departure for Spain. He took charge of the excavating the Regi Lagni, planned by Fontana but only begun in the 17th century, before in 1634 the engineer Tommaso Alappio (? – ?, 23 August 1646) took over overall control whilst Picchiatti continued to direct the building site. In 1654 the Congregazione dei Nobili put Picchiatti in charge of designing and building the Palazzo Monte dei Poveri Vergognosi. Three years later he had a son, Francesco Antonio Picchiatti, who also became an architect and assisted his father in the last years of his life.
In 1620 Bartolomeo completed San Giorgio dei Genovesi and in 1621 designed the gateway to Palazzo di Sangro (constructed by Giuliano Finelli) and the small Santuario della Madonna dell'Arco. 1621 also saw him inherit the building site for San Carlo alle Mortelle - he also went on to design its college and thus became a trusted architect for the Barnabites. Following Giulio Cesare Fontana's death in 1627 he also took over as official engineer to the royal court, a post his son also later assumed. In 1632 he and Cosimo Fanzago rebuilt Pozzuoli Cathedral in Rione Terra. In 1638 he worked on the church of Santi Apostoli, designing its elegant two-colour bell-tower. That year he also worked on the building of Santa Maria della Stella.
In 1641 he and his son jointly designed the Basilica of Sant'Agostino alla Zecca. He also restored Santa Maria Donnalbina at an unknown date. He died in 1643 and all his outstanding projects were assigned to Onofrio Antonio Gisolfi, who until 1656 took over the role of royal engineer.

Clanio

The Clanio (also: "Lagno"; ; ) is a river on the Campanian plain, southern Italy, noted in antiquity. It rises in the Apennines near Avella, flows past Acerra and discharges into the Tyrrhenian Sea about south of the Volturno. The Greek origins of its name are linked to the abundance of violets on its banks, as cited in Giulianus Maius's treatise "De priscorum proprietate verborum V. Clanius": "Clanius fluvius Campaniae prope Acerras a χλανις idest viola, qua ejus ripae abundant". 
The town of Acerrae frequently suffered severely from the ravages of its waters during floods. At other times their stagnation rendered the country unhealthy; hence in the seventeenth century the stream was diverted into a canal or artificial course, called "il regio Lagno". This is divided into two streams near its mouth, the one of which flows direct into the sea, and is known as "Foce dei Lagni", the other takes a more southerly direction, and joins, or rather forms, a marshy lake called the "Lago di Patria" (the ancient Literna Palus), the outlet of which into the sea, about miles south of the former branch, called the "Foce di Patria". This is evidently the same which was known in ancient times as the river "Liternus ternus", and appears to have been then the principal, if not the only outlet of the Clanius, as Strabo, who describes the coast of Campania minutely, does not notice the latter river.

The Palazzo Buono is a palace in Naples, located on via Toledo in the Montecalvario district. It was first commissioned in the 17th century by the De Curtis family and designed by Bartolomeo Picchiatti. It later housed the "Monte dei Poveri Vergognosi" bank and during the ten years of French occupation it became the tribunal of commerce.
After the French departed, it was bought by the Buono family, who in 1826 took on Gaetano Genovese to rebuild it in the neoclassical style. It was later acquired by the Bocconi brothers, who turned it into a department store before selling it in 1921 to the Società Magazzini Milanesi, which became La Rinascente. In 2008 La Rinascente shut down and the palace remained closed until 2011, when it became an H&amp;M store.

I Was Jack (You Were Diane)

"I Was Jack (You Were Diane)" is a song recorded by American country music singer Jake Owen. It was written by David Ray, Tommy Cecil, Jody Stevens, Craig Wiseman, and John Mellencamp, with production handled by Joey Moi. It is Owen's first single from his sixth studio album "Greetings from... Jake".
Content.
The song is a tribute to John Mellencamp's 1982 single "Jack &amp; Diane", and credits Mellencamp as a co-writer for incorporating that song's guitar riff. "Rolling Stone" writer Chris Parton described the song: "Owen's updated version highlights the original's impact on present-day America, while a regular Joe reminisces about falling in love to the tune years before." Owen said that he asked Mellencamp personally for permission to incorporate portions of "Jack &amp; Diane" into the song, and recorded it after receiving Mellencamp's permission. Owen said that he wanted to record it because of the feelings of nostalgia that the lyrics evoked in him.
The song is Owen's first release on Big Loud Records, following a decade on RCA Records Nashville.
Commercial performance.
The song has sold 110,000 copies in the United States as of August 2018.

Want You Back (5 Seconds of Summer song)

"Want You Back" is a song recorded by Australian pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer. It was written by Calum Hood, Asia Whiteacre, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Ashton Irwin, Luke Hemmings, Steve Mac and Andrew Goldstein, with production handled by Goldstein and Andrew Wells. The song was released via Capitol Records on 22 February 2018, as the lead single from their third studio album, "Youngblood" (2018).
Background and release.
Guitarist Michael Clifford first opened up about the third album and the upcoming single in an interview with "Billboard" in December 2017. He admitted: "We're at a point now where we're almost ready to put out our first single," as he promised that fans could expect it "really, really early in the new year".
On 16 February 2018, the band posted a black and white picture featuring all members on Twitter, captioning it "Behind The Scenes 2018." They shared another tweet with the hashtag "#5SOS3ISCOMING" shortly afterwards, hinting at new releases. They also teased a few lyrics from the song and posted a GIF which says "We Want You Back". The song was officially announced on 19 February 2018, along with its release date, cover art, and a brief audio snippet. The song was released alongside the announcement of their worldwide promotional 5SOS III Tour dates.
Drummer Ashton Irwin said of the song in an interview with Beats 1: "'Want You Back' articulates the band we were, we are now, and what we're gonna be, that's why I like it and that's why we picked it. We also made it with close friends like we've got Andrew Goldstein who we literally see every week. We party together, we confess our sorrows and happiness. We speak to this man everyday." The band told news.com.au that they are "super nervous" about the comeback song which will introduce their third album.
Critical reception.
Madeline Roth of MTV News stated that the song "marks a huge departure from the band's raucous pop-punk roots". She found the band "opting for a slick, more polished pop sound on the new tune, which finds them reminiscing about an ex and wondering what went wrong". Althea Legaspi of "Rolling Stone" regarded it as a "pop-flavored track reflects on a lost love and captures the yearning that often follows a breakup". Hugh McIntyre of "Forbes" found the song "surprisingly slick, especially for a band that has pushed a narrative of being rowdy rock boys", and he noticed that the song was "more mature".
Mike Wass of Idolator wrote that the band have abandoned "the pop/punk of their first two albums and dive head-first into slick, radio-friendly pop with a rhythmic edge". Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" deemed it an "apologetic pop track" and a "synth-y upbeat tune". Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio opined that it "takes a step back from 5SOS's signature pop/punk vibes" and "playing up the guys' pop side a bit more".
Live performances.
On 11 April 2018, the band performed the song live on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon". They also performed the single during the fourteenth season of "The Voice" on 8 May 2018.
Music video.
The official music video was released on 27 March 2018. It features the members of the band performing in a colorful one-room set, depicting a scenario where the rules of gravity does not apply. The furniture can be seen fixed to the walls and ceiling as the band members remain on the ground while singing and playing their instruments. In some shots, they appear to be walking and sitting on the walls and ceiling. The video shows mostly full-room shots of the set and some closeup shots of the band members. The closeup shots of the band members' faces are often opaquely overlaid on the full-room shots.

North Metropolitan TAFE

North Metropolitan TAFE is a state government funded educational facility delivering Technical and Further Education (TAFE). It services the northern suburbs of Perth across ten campuses.
It was formed on 11 April 2016, when the State Government announced after the "Independent Review of the Vocational Education and Training Sector in Western Australia", that the 11 State Training Providers would be streamlined and form five new TAFE colleges in Western Australia. This resulted in the merging of Central Institute and West Coast Institute to form North Metropolitan TAFE.
At the beginning of 2017, two campuses (Balga and Midland) that were formerly part of Polytechnic West also joined North Metropolitan TAFE.
North Metropolitan TAFE has about 1500 (casual, part-time, full-time) staff that collaborate with local industry to ensure that courses are meeting the demands of students wanting to enter the workforce with up-to-date, industry-specific, practical skills. As of 2019, more than 30,000 students were enrolled in approximately 350 Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses covering a number of industry areas.
Courses.
North Metropolitan TAFE offers courses that are nationally recognised VET courses under the Australian Quality Training Framework (AQTF). Students can study qualifications at a variety of levels, including:
Qualifications can be studied full-time, part-time, or online (self-paced study). Components of qualifications can also be studied as Short Courses over a few weeks. Some courses allow students to enrol as an apprentice or trainee, resulting in part of the training for the course being completed “on the job”.
North Metropolitan TAFE courses can, in some instances, prepare students for university studies. North Metropolitan TAFE have arrangements in place with local Western Australian universities and national higher education providers so that credits/advanced standing can be applied to units completed at TAFE.
The industry areas that North Metropolitan TAFE has courses covering include:
Campuses.
In the suburb of Perth, North Metropolitan TAFE has its main campus within the area bound by Newcastle Street, William Street, Francis Street and Beaufort Street, just to the north of the State Library of Western Australia and Perth Cultural Centre.
In East Perth, North Metropolitan TAFE’s campus comprises the Mining Training Centre and the newly renovated Green Skills Training Centre, which is completely self-sufficient in energy and water, earning it a 6 star Green Rating for design by the Green Building Council of Australia.
At the Leederville campus of North Metropolitan TAFE Human Services type courses are catered for. This campus also has a professional recording studio and live performance venue with full staging, lighting and sound production.
Similarly, the Mount Lawley campus of North Metropolitan TAFE has courses with a focus on health services.
In conjunction with the University of Western Australia, North Metropolitan TAFE has a campus for its Dental courses in Nedlands, at the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia.
The North Metropolitan TAFE campuses in Balga and Midland were formerly part of South Metropolitan TAFE (in 2016) and prior to that they were part of Polytechnic West, which was formerly known as Swan TAFE. The Balga campus was originally known as the Balga Technical School and was established in the early 1970s.
In the northern Perth suburb of Joondalup, North Metropolitan TAFE has two campuses on Kendrew Crescent and on McLarty Avenue. The Kendrew Crescent campus was the main campus of the former West Coast Institute, built in 1992. The McLarty Avenue campus, also referred to as the Health and Wellness Training Campus, has a simulation hospital to assist with nursing and other health courses, and is situated close to the Joondalup Health Campus.
Further north in Clarkson, North Metropolitan TAFE has its Trades Training Centre to cater for various building and construction courses. This campus was formerly known as Trades North, which was part of West Coast Institute.

Air Italy (2018–2020)

Air Italy (registered as AIR ITALY S.p.A.) was a privately owned Italian airline, headquartered in Olbia, Sardinia. In 2019, the company was the second largest airline in Italy, behind Italian flag carrier Alitalia, and the 40th largest in Europe by number of passengers in 2019. The airline was a subsidiary of AQA Holding, owned by Alisarda (51%) and Qatar Airways (49%). The airline operated a fleet of Boeing 737NG, Boeing 737 MAX 8 and Airbus A330 aircraft to over 34 scheduled domestic, European and intercontinental destinations. The airline operated from its main hub at Milan Malpensa Airport.
On 11 February 2020, Air Italy ceased all its own operations and went into liquidation, announcing that all routes would be served until 25 February 2020 by third-party carriers. However, on 19 February 2020, the airline re-opened ticket sales for their Milan Linate-Olbia and Rome-Fiumicino-Olbia PSO routes and operated them until 16 April 2020.
History.
Background.
In 1963, Alisarda was established to provide a fast and reliable air service connecting Olbia, gateway to the newly created resort of the Costa Smeralda, and major Italian and European destinations. On 2 May 1991, the airline changed its name to Meridiana.
Subsequently rebranded Meridiana Fly after the acquisition and merger of defunct Italian airline Eurofly, the airline later returned to its original Meridiana name after acquiring former charter airline Air Italy (which operated from 2005 to 2018, operating under the Meridiana brand as of 2013).
Launch of the new Air Italy.
Air Italy was established on 19 February 2018. A press conference in Milan announced that Meridiana and its subsidiary, the original Air Italy, which had been part of Meridiana since 2013, would be merged to create the new Air Italy. The focus of the company was to introduce a stable new Italian airline which could become the flagship carrier of Italy. Air Italy's competitor Alitalia, the Italian flag carrier, had filed for administration on 2 May 2017. The plan also introduced new branding, a new cabin experience, new airport lounge and new destinations. During the press conference, the airline expressed interest in joining the Oneworld airline alliance. The airline also announced that Qatar Airways would have a Codeshare agreement with the airline.
All branding and business of the new Air Italy took effect on 1 March 2018. The Meridiana IATA, ICAO, and AOC codes were merged into the new Air Italy. The airline website was relaunched with the re-branding. Aircraft transferred from Meridiana still used the Meridiana livery with the Air Italy name. Meridiana codeshare agreements and slots were transferred to the new Air Italy brand.
2018-2019.
In April 2018, Air Italy and Qatar Airways launched their planned codeshare on selected flights. On 18 April 2018, the airline appointed Neil Mills as chief operating officer (COO); he had worked with the recently bankrupt airline Air Berlin. The airline introduced Rossen Dimitrov as Chief Customer Experience Officer (CCEO) on 22 April.
On 22 April 2018, Air Italy became the Italian launch customer of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The first aircraft, fully painted, was introduced to the public on Air Italy's social media pages and delivered at a handover ceremony with Boeing executives at Boeing's Everett Delivery Centre in Seattle on 11 May 2018. The airline celebrated the delivery of the aircraft on 14 May after the aircraft was handed over to Air Italy in Seattle.

Corporate affairs.
Ownership and structure.
Air Italy S.p.A. was 100% owned by its parent company AQA Holding S.p.A., founded on 2 September 2017 after Qatar Airways purchased a 49% stake in Meridiana (later rebranded the new Air Italy). Alisarda retained a 51% stake.
Air Italy had three subsidiaries inherited from Meridiana after a merger with the former Air Italy to form a new airline.
Head office and Leadership.
Air Italy's headquarters were located in Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport in Olbia, Italy, formerly owned by Meridiana.
The Leadership team at Air Italy was as follows:
Corporate identity.
The Air Italy logo was designed with maroon and mint green colors that were loosely based on the maroon from the Qatar Airways logo. The airline had a special design to make the letter "Y" reminiscent of a bird. The aircraft livery was white with the billboard style logo painted across the fuselage. It also included a collage of the stylistic "Y" taken from the logo on the aircraft fin. The Y was also present on the aircraft engines.
Sponsorships.
Air Italy sponsored a professional sports team, the Italian Dinamo Sassari basketball team.
Controversies.
The United States' three largest airlines, Delta, American Airlines, and United, made allegations regarding Air Italy's ownership and operation because of its support from Qatar Airways. Air Italy made a public statement on the issue with a press release on 18 April 2019. Ed Bastian, Chief executive officer of Delta, posted an op-ed article on the airline in December 2018 claiming that since Qatar Airways is a state-funded airline of Qatar supporting a nearly bankrupt Italian airline, it was "putting thousands of American jobs at risk". A few US politicians wrote letters to United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, alleging that Qatar was in violation of the United States-Qatar Open Skies Policy. Air Italy and Qatar Airways denied the allegations, stating that they were borne of Qatar Airways' 49% stake in Air Italy's parent company.
Destinations.
As of February 2019, Air Italy operated to 21 year-round and five seasonal destinations in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Air Italy aimed to fly more than 50 year-round routes by 2022, as stated in the airline's five-year plan. The airline operated most flights out of its main Milan Malpensa hub, and a second network out of its Olbia, Sardinia focus city.
Codeshare agreements.
Air Italy had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
Special Prorate Agreement.

Fleet.
Current fleet.
, the Air Italy fleet consisted of the following aircraft:
Fleet development.
After rebranding of the airline as Air Italy, Boeing 737 aircraft that had been operated by Meridiana were used to operate the airline's route network. Air Italy planned to develop its fleet by operating 50 new aircraft by 2022, by sub-leasing 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 30 Boeing 787-8s from Qatar Airways, with entry into service between 2018 and 2022. From 2018 to 2019, Qatar Airways planned to lease five of its own Airbus A330-200s to Air Italy at market rate, with Boeing 787-8s transferred to Air Italy from mid-2019 after the delivery of Boeing 787-9s to Qatar Airways during the same period.
In May 2019, the airline said that due to delays in the delivery of Qatar Airways' Boeing 787-9s, the planned transfer of Qatar's Boeing 787-8s to Air Italy had been delayed, resulting in its decision to expand long-haul operations with additional Airbus A330s from Qatar Airways. Additionally, after the airline's first three Boeing 737 MAX 8s were grounded, the possibility of transitioning to an Airbus narrow-body fleet was considered.

Palazzo di Sangro

Palazzo di Sangro, also known as either Palazzo de Sangro di Sansevero or Palazzo Sansevero, is a late-Renaissance-style aristocratic palace facing the church of San Domenico Maggiore, separated by the via named after the church, in the city center of Naples, Italy. Part of the palace facade faces the piazza in front of the church, which is also bordered to the south by the Palazzo di Sangro di Casacalenda.
History.
A palace at the site was begun by Paolo di Sangro, duke of Torremaggiore in the 16th century as his family residence. It was designed by the sculptor and architect Giovanni da Nola. Around that time it was also resident to the nobleman and composer Carlo Gesualdo - it was here that he murdered his wife. Giovan Francesco Paolo di Sangro, 1st Prince of San Severo, began building a family burial chapel in the palace grounds - it was completed in 1613 by his son Alessandro, patriarch of Alexandria and archbishop of Benevento. Paolo de Sangro, 2nd Prince of San Severo, rebuilt the palace, especially the facade, with designs by Bartolomeo Picchiatti and with a portal entryway sculpted by Vitale Finelli.
The palace's peak came in the 18th century when Raimondo di Sangro, 7th Prince of San Severo, redesigned the interior of the chapel and palace and linked the two buildings with a passageway. A marble plaque on the facade commemorates his association with the palace. He began the works in 1735 and they were completed by his son Vincenzo in the 1790s. On the night of 28 September 1889 the passageway was flooded and collapsed.
The atrium has anthropomorphic sculptural decorations attributed to Giuseppe Sammartino and Francesco Celebrano. The mezzanine decorations of the Seasons are also attributed to Celebrano. The palace was once decorated with frescos by Belisario Corenzio, destroyed during the collapse of the hall.

Thomas Evans Blackwell

Thomas Evans Blackwell (28 July 1819 – 25 June 1863) was an English civil engineer.
Life and career.
Born in Devizes, Wiltshire, Blackwell was the only son of John Blackwell and Frances Cooper. He was baptised at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Devizes on 1 October 1819.
Blackwell was educated in mathematics by his godfather, Thomas Evans, who was vicar in Froxfield, Wiltshire. In , at the age of 17, Blackwell was employed as an apprentice to the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, a position arranged by his father who had been the company's superintending engineer since 1806. 
Upon his father's death in 1840, the 21-year-old Blackwell became the company's engineer. One of his first tasks was working with Isambard Kingdom Brunel when the canal was diverted to accommodate a cut for the new Great Western Railway (GWR). Described as sagacious, Blackwell foresaw the impact the railway system would have on the transportation industry and the decline of the canal network, and recommended to the Kennet and Avon Canal Company that the line of the waterway should be converted into a railway. In 1845 he prepared the relevant plans to put before Parliament, although the Great Western Railway company strongly opposed competition to their existing Great Western Main Line. GWR successfully avoided the scheme by purchasing the waterway. Blackwell was employed as resident engineer on the Bradford and Bathampton branch of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, but left the role upon the railway's amalgamation with GWR.
Between 1843 and 1844, he was responsible for the canal between Bath and Devizes and oversaw the renovation of Claverton Pumping Station's pumps and waterwheel. Blackwell oversaw similar works to the Boulton and Watt pump at Crofton Pumping Station at the same time. In 1846, Blackwell petitioned Parliament to extend the Great Western Main Line (from its then-terminus at ) to ; the extension was built and opened the following year. He was later involved with the Severn and Wye Railway and the Lydney Canal, the Glamorganshire Canal, the Stourbridge Canal, and the Market Weighton Canal. He worked on the docks at Birkenhead and the Port of Tyne, as well as waterworks systems in Bristol, Bath, Wolverhampton and Gloucester and similar projects in Reading, Sandgate, Devizes and Harwich. In 1853, he was employed with the Kensington and Brentford Canal Company.
On 12 January 1852, Blackwell took up the role of engineer of the Bristol Docks at a salary of £300 plus allowances. He put forward a proposal for docks at Avonmouth, and worked with James Meadows Rendel to design a railway connecting the docks to the port of Bristol. He also rebuilt Hills Bridge, an 1805 Jessop crossing of the Avon which collapsed after a coke barge collided with a bridge pier—Blackwell's ornamental wrought iron bridge had a span and was completed in a very short time. Blackwell resigned as the docks' engineer in late 1855, ostensibly due to the role's shift away from traditional engineering towards business matters and the prohibition of supplementary employment. He suggested he take the role of consulting engineer, and proposed a pay cut from £500 to £200 to allow his then-assistant Thomas Howard to be employed as a local engineer. The committee subsequently employed Blackwell as a consultant, albeit without salary, and Howard as resident and superintending engineer—with a £300 salary.
Blackwell developed an improved version of the aneroid barometer; his device was used by James Glaisher (who found it the most accurate aneroid barometer he ever used) and William Froude (who felt it more convenient, portable, and reliable than the normal aneroid barometer).
On 31 December 1856, the Government appointed him one of three commissioners to consider a London sewerage system for the Metropolitan Board of Works. The following year, however, Blackwell moved to Canada to take up office as vice president and general manager of the Grand Trunk Railway and the presidency of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad. He retired in 1862 before returning to England.
In 1863, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.
Legacy.
The Blackwell neighbourhood of Sarnia, Ontario is named after Blackwell. Writing in the 1907 obituary of Blackwell's son Charles, the American Society of Civil Engineers described Thomas as "the first hydraulic engineer in England".
Personal life.
Blackwell married Ann Buckland in September 1840. They had ten children, at least one of whom died in infancy:
In the 1851 census, the family were living at 65 Great Pulteney Street in Bath, although Thomas was not listed as being present. In 1857 the family emigrated to Canada; their final child (Helen) was born there. The 1861 Canada East census lists the family as residing in a three-storey stone house in Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada. Between 1858 and 1862, the family resided at 51 Sherbrooke Street West in the city. Blackwell sent two of his sons—John and Edward—to Rugby School. They enrolled in 1860 and 1861 respectively.
After Blackwell retired due to ill health in 1862, he toured the United States before returning to England. He subsequently visited Egypt and the Nile, returning home via Rome and Naples. He was bed ridden the day after returning.
Blackwell died of "chronic inflammation of the membranes of the spinal cord" on 25 June 1863 while living in Warwick Square, Pimlico. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. A memorial plaque to Blackwell and his father is in the church at Hungerford, Berkshire, where his parents are buried. It reads:
A number of Blackwell's children—including Fanny, William, Kennet, and George—remained in Canada after their father's return to Britain. Fanny married Gilbert Girdwood at Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal on 9 April 1862.

Six Minutes to Midnight

Six Minutes to Midnight is a 2020 British war drama film directed by Andy Goddard from a screenplay (loosely based on a true story) by Goddard, Celyn Jones and Eddie Izzard, starring Izzard, Judi Dench, Carla Juri, James D'Arcy and Jim Broadbent.
"Six Minutes to Midnight" was released in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021, by Sky Cinema. The film received mixed and average reviews from critics.
Plot.
The story begins at the Augusta-Victoria College, a finishing school for daughters of the Nazi elite, located in the English coastal town of Bexhill-on-Sea. Shortly before World War II, the establishment is under surveillance by the British secret service. British agent Miller, masquerading as a school teacher, is seeking to discover what happened to his predecessor, who has disappeared. Some time passes and the school heads to the beach to swim. There the body of the old teacher is found in the shallows.
Agent Miller looks for clues and during a party he overhears a German agent tell PT instructor Ilse Keller of plans to secretly repatriate the students to Germany. Miller rushes to his commander to tell him the news but Keller comes and shoots the commander and frames Miller for it. Miller flees to the seaside town where next morning all around the town there are posters advertising his being wanted for murder. His likeness is also on the front page of the local newspaper.
Despite disguising himself as a bandsman in a stolen uniform and joining a parade, he is caught and incarcerated in the local police cell, then extracted by detective Captain Drey and his corporal Willis. Miller reveals his identity as a British agent to Drey, offering a microfilm stashed at the school as evidence of his role. They take the handcuffed Miller back to the school to recover the film cassette containing a copy of Keller's list of British undercover operatives in Germany. Drey, however, is a German agent. At the school, Miller overpowers Drey and goes on the run again. Local busdriver Charlie sees him along the road, and drives him to his farm, where, believing Miller’s story, he uses a hacksaw to remove the cuffs. Drey and Willis arrive and Miller is on the run again. He finds a phone box miles from anywhere and has just enough time to pass on the code phrase "Six Minutes to Midnight" to his superiors before Drey and Willis arrive. Miller, realizing that Corporal Willis is not a German agent, starts talking. Drey turns and shoots Willis as his cover has been blown; Miller runs for it, and Drey takes his time casually shooting at Miller before sighting for the kill. Before Drey can fire at Miller again, the dying Willis shoots his superior.
Miller returns to the school, where principal Rocholl finds her charges all gone. They have been led, some reluctantly, by Keller to a clifftop paddock where they form two lines to mark out a landing strip. It is getting dark when the Luftwaffe plane arrives and the "Mädchen" light their flares and hold them aloft, but an RAF Spitfire arrives and the triple-engine intruder turns away just as Miller and Rocholl pull up in Willis’ car. Keller pulls a gun, intending to shoot one of the dissident girls, but Miller talks her out of it; the girls run to Rocholl, and Keller surrenders to Miller. 
A few days later, Miller says goodbye to Rocholl in her office at the school, and the girls sing a parting chorus of "It's a Long Way to Tipperary". From a Bakelite radio comes Chamberlain's voice announcing that Britain is now at war with Germany.
Production.
In an interview with Chortle, actor Eddie Izzard said that she had finished co-writing her first script with Celyn Jones with a setting of the Second World War, taking place in Bexhill-on-Sea where Izzard grew up. Izzard's former girlfriend, Sarah Townsend, was originally set to direct the film following previous collaborations on documentaries with Izzard. However, it was announced that the director would be Andy Goddard, who is known for his work on "Downton Abbey". The same day, Judi Dench was cast as the headmistress. Lionsgate will distribute the film domestically, with the international distribution rights currently up for sale. 
Principal photography began on July 3, 2018 and ran for six weeks, shooting in Wales and various locations around the UK.
Release.
The film was released in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021 by Sky Cinema. It was previously scheduled to be released on 29 May 2020, by Lionsgate, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. IFC Films distributed the film in the United States, where it was also released on 26 March 2021.
Reception.
In a review for RogerEbert.com, critic Nell Minow writes: "The issues of individual, cultural, and national loyalty—and when and how to respond to aggressive actions by other nations—are relegated to the background of some weak chase scenes and plot twists." 
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 34% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Six Minutes to Midnight" has a fascinating fact-based WWII-era story to tell, but largely loses it in muddled spy shenanigans." According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 14 critics, the film received "mixed or average reviews".

Promised Land (Harold Land album)

Promised Land is the final studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land. The album was recorded in La Jolla, CA and released on 27 March 2001 via Audiophoric label.
Reception.
David R. Adler of Allmusic wrote "Veteran tenor saxophonist Harold Land returns from a seven-year recording hiatus with Promised Land, featuring Mulgrew Miller on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums. (Sadly, this would be one of Higgins's last sessions.) One would expect nothing other than beauty and grace from these four revered players, and that's what they deliver, aided by the Audiophoric label's "m-phoric" recording technology, designed to capture live acoustic performance with exceptional fidelity. (You'll need to increase your volume and give your ears a chance to adjust.) There's a bit of Coltrane and Joe Henderson in Land's playing—and perhaps a bit of Charlie Rouse, too, as Monk's "Ugly Beauty" reveals. Miller is in excellent form, dueting with Land on a nine-minute-plus "What's New" and taking crisp, inventive solos throughout. The program is evenly split: three standards and three of Land's fairly straightforward, modal pieces."
A reviewer of All About Jazz stated "Time allows, eventually, the opportunity for self-actualization—one hopes. After a long, under-appreciated career and sparse discography, tenor saxophonist, Harold Land, affirms his stature on this album as an individual stylist. Land’s sound has matured into something distinctly his own—a combination of the swing style of his early career and a full command of Coltrane-inspired “sheets of sound”...Notwithstanding the solid group dynamic between tenor and rhythm section, it is the leader’s voice that prevails throughout this set. Straight-ahead fans will find fulfillment in this album from an often-overlooked jazz veteran."

Stone Pier

Stone Pier, also known as South Pier, is a pier located on the southern side of the entrance of Weymouth Harbour, in Dorset, England. It extends out from the Nothe Peninsula, which is the location of the Nothe Fort and Nothe Gardens.
History.
Stone Pier was constructed in the 18th century at the entrance of Weymouth Harbour and was far shorter than the existing structure. Originally loose stones forming a breakwater continued out from the pier for a further 370 feet. A buoy was placed at the seaward end as the breakwater was covered at times of high tide. The Great Storms of 1824 caused much damage to the pier, resulting in a rebuild. Later in 1876, work was completed on a 250 feet extension to the pier along the breakwater below, which provided greater protection to Weymouth Pier opposite and vessels using the harbour. The pier was extended again in the 1910s, with a tower erected on the end to accommodate a navigational light. Reinforcement works were undertaken in the 1980s following storm damage. Today the pier is a popular place for sea anglers and walkers.

<doc id="56639076" url="?curid=56639076" title="Joseph S. Cole">
Joseph S. Cole

Joseph Stear Carlyon Cole (c. 1831 – 15 October 1916), was an educator in South Australia, the founder of Stanley Grammar School in Watervale, South Australia. For most of his life he was referred to as Joseph S. Cole, or Joseph St. Cole (!), then around 1885 began calling himself Carlyon or J. S. Carlyon Cole.
History.
Cole was born in the City of Exeter in Devon, where he was educated by Matthew Bennett of the Oakhampton Street Grammar School, by his father George Talbert Cole, and by his father's friend Dr. Radford, perhaps the paediatrician and gynaecologist Thomas Radford MD (1793–1881).
He was brought up in the Church of England, confirmed by Dr. Philpotts and sang in the choir at Exeter Cathedral. He was enrolled to spend a few years at Exeter College, Oxford, but was pulled out by his uncle John Clifton, manager for the noted builder Thomas Cubitt, who had secured a position for the lad in London, which he was pleased to accept.
The next nine years was a great experience for him, as he was able to learn a great deal at the nearby Birkbeck School, University College, Royal Institute, and the Royal College of Chemistry. He left his uncle and found lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he socialised with members of the legal profession and began reading for Law. He was responsible for introducing a friend's poetry to Mr. Justice Talfourd (died 1854).
In 1856 Sapper Cpl John Coles ( 24 April 1886), an uncle on his mother's side, invited Cole to join him in Penwortham, South Australia. Cpl Coles was on Grey's 1837–38 expedition to the North West of Australia and 1839 expedition to the West, and with Eyre in 1840,
In 1842 Coles lost all four fingers of his right hand in a "feu de joie" accident and had to be pensioned off, and secured a position as Crown Lands ranger.
What Coles' plans for his nephew were are unclear, but an opportunity arose at nearby Auburn, where plans for a day school initiated by William Hocking, previously of the Burra, had fallen through, and the town's unofficial "mayor", Joseph Edwin "Joe" Bleechmore, publican of the "Rising Sun" and friend of Coles, suggested Cole take it over.
The school opened 28 May 1855 in the New Chapel, and under Cole's tutorship the children's education developed remarkably.
Cole resigned in mid 1858, to be replaced by the Rev. Edward Newlyn. The Auburn school closed briefly to enable refurbishment of the building.
Cole was appointed to the new school in Watervale, whose 59 students initially met in the Bible Christian chapel, awaiting the completion of the new publicly funded schoolhouse, which opened on 17 February 1859.
In mid 1861 Cole accepted a position as the first headmaster of the re-opened Pulteney Street School, which he relinquished three months later to resume mastership of Watervale school, which had been closed from June to September for lack of a teacher.
He purchased the block of land between the schoolhouse and Commercial Street, and in 1863 began construction of his private school, with four rooms at the rear section of what would become the present two-storey structure. 
In 1871 the building was extended upward, with four dormitories on the upper floor. A new section was added at ground floor level with another two dormitories above.
In 1876 the process of transferring ownership of the schoolhouse from the Council of Education to the District Council was underway.
In 1878 Cole relinquished his teacher's licence so he could run his school independently of the Council of Education. He made an offer (which was rejected) to purchase that building to become part of his private school.
Joseph died in 1916, Hannah died in 1928. Their remains were buried in St Marks's churchyard, Penwortham.
Family.
Joseph Stear Carlyon Cole (c. 1831 – 15 October 1916) married Hannah Peacock (c. March 1842 – 24 August 1928) on 29 November 1862. Hannah was a sister of Henry Furneaux Peacock
The explorer John Coles (5 December 1814 – April 1886) was a maternal uncle; presumably a brother of his mother.

<doc id="56639101" url="?curid=56639101" title="Dead heat">
Dead heat

A dead heat is a rare situation in various racing sports in which the performances of competitors are judged to be so close that no difference between them can be resolved. The result is declared a tie and the competitors are awarded a joint ranking. Dead heats can occur in both head-to-head races and competitions where competitors race sequentially and are ranked by finishing time.
Photo finishes have been a long-standing method of resolving outcomes too ambiguous to be distinguished by the naked eye. Improvements in technology, including digital super-slow motion replay and pressure-sensitive digital timers, have increased precision in resolving dead heats. Consequently, dead heats are declared less often than they once were.
Etymology.
The Oxford English Dictionary attributes the term to horse racing. Meets formerly had the same horses run several "heats" in a day, with victors being decided by the total number of wins. A heat which had no clear single winner was discounted from these tallies and was therefore "dead".
Occurrence.
Dead heats are very rare, and situations with three (or more) competitors in a dead heat are exceptionally so. The frequency of dead heats varies between sports, depending on the typical variance in performances and the precision of the technology available. The use of the photo finish, first introduced in horse racing in second quarter of the 20th century, notably decreased the number of dead heats. Both of the two recorded quadruple dead heats in horse racing occurred in England in the 1850s.
Swimming has a relatively high number of dead heats because, under FINA rules (which includes Olympic events), positions are based on race timings which are limited in precision to hundredths of a second; this is despite the availability of technology that could provide further precision.
The reason for this is that the length of lanes can vary by up to , with lower-precision timing compensating for the possible differences between the distances competitors have travelled.
Occasionally racers will try to deliberately engineer a dead heat. During the mid-1940s, twin distance runners H. Ross Hume and Robert H. Hume became known as the "dead heat twins" for their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in intentional efforts to share victory. At the 2002 United States Grand Prix auto racing teammates Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher attempted to tie for first place, however Barrichello was adjudicated to have won by 0.011 seconds.
Outcome.
If a dead heat is declared, all tied competitors are considered to have jointly achieved the superior position (unless a tie-breaking method is used to separate them). This does not affect awards for subsequent finishers. For example, in the final of the Women's 100 metre freestyle at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Penny Oleksiak and Simone Manuel finished in a dead heat for first place. Both were awarded gold medals, no silver medal was awarded, and the next finisher, Sarah Sjöström, received bronze.
Prizes for the tied competitors may be divided. The rules of Formula 1, for example, specify that a dead heat in a race would result in the World Championship points for both the superior and inferior position being added together and divided equally between the tied competitors. Complications can occur if the reward cannot be divided or duplicated: at the Women's 100 meters at the 2012 United States Olympic Track Trials, Jeneba Tarmoh and Allyson Felix finished in a dead heat for the third and final place in the US Olympic team, with there being no provision in the rules to resolve the situation (a head-to-head run-off was proposed, but Tarmoh eventually conceded the place).
In Grand Prix motorcycle racing, joint rankings are resolved by using fastest lap times as a tiebreaker. This rule resulted in Héctor Faubel winning the 125cc classification of the 2011 German motorcycle Grand Prix after a photo finish could not separate him and Johann Zarco.
Special provision is made for dead heats in the rules of sports betting: punters' stakes are divided proportionally by the number of tied competitors.

It is encircled by precipice from eastern, western and southwestern sides, forest from the north side, and slope from the south-eastside. The fortress is situated on the coast of Incechay, at a height of 1700 m above sea level and 200–250 m above the nearby territory. The way to the fortress is from south-east. The length of the fortress is 200–250 m in the east–west direction and 20–25 m in the north–south direction. The width of the wall is 0.8–0.9 m in the north and west, and in the south wall it is 1.5 m. It is reported that there is also a secret road leading to the river.
The name of the fortress, "Gulustan" is a Persian word, meaning "flower garden". Certain towers of it have been preserved. According to researchers the date of construction of the tower dates back to the period of Caucasian Albania. It is built of local stones. The fortress was a strong defensive tower. It was the center of the Gulustan Kingdom which existed in the 18th–19th centuries. Also, the significant historic Treaty of Gulistan was signed in this fortress.

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina

Squamous-cell carcinoma of the vagina is a potentially invasive type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the vagina. Though uncommon, squamous-cell cancer of the vagina (SCCV) is the most common type of vaginal cancer. It is further subdivided into the following subtypes: keratinizing, nonkeratinizing, basaloid, and warty. It forms in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Squamous cell vaginal cancer spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer. SCCV accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases and initially spreads superficially within the vaginal wall. It can later invade other vaginal tissues. The carcinoma can metastasize to the lungs, and less frequently in liver, bone, or other sites. SCC of the vagina is associated with a high rate of infection with oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) and has many risk factors in common with cervical cancer.
Signs and symptoms.
SCCV may not cause early signs or symptoms and may be found during a routine pelvic exam and Pap test. Signs and symptoms may be caused by other types of vaginal cancer or by other conditions:
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis includes a complete assessment of medical history and physical examination. A pelvic exam is typically performed. Other diagnostic procedures used are the pap test, colposcopy and biopsy. Other procedures are used to aid in diagnosis: chest x-ray, CT scan (CAT scan), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), PET scan (positron emission tomography scan), and cystoscopy.
Treatment.
Treatment depends upon the following:

Pozzuoli Cathedral

Pozzuoli Cathedral or the Basilica of San Procolo martire is the main Roman Catholic church in Pozzuoli and the seat of the Diocese of Pozzuoli. It sits at the top of the Rione Terra and is built around an ancient Roman temple.
History.
Origins.
The site probably originated as part of the town's capitolium of the Greek or Samnite era, radically rebuilt in the Republican and Augustan eras. The church was first housed in a former Roman temple, the Temple of Augustus built by the rich merchant Lucius Calpurnius. Its dedicatory inscription survives, reading "L. Calpurnius L.f. templum Aug. cum ornamentis d.s.f." (Lucius Calpurnius, son of Lucius, dedicated this temple and its ornamentation to Augustus at his own expense). It was designed by the architect Cocceius Auctus on the remains of an earlier Republican temple built in 194 BC, which had been restored by Sulla in 78 BC. The Temple of Augustus was a pseudoperipteral exastyle temple, with nine fluted Corinthian columns along each long side and a rectangular cella formed of white marble blocks. The whole temple was built without the use of mortar. Between the end of the 5th and the start of the 6th century the inhabitants of the town decided to rededicate the temple as a church to Proculus of Pozzuoli. In 1538 it suffered major damage as Tripergole subsided and Monte Nuovo was formed. Bishop Gian Matteo Castaldo restored it, funding it by selling off all the episcopal stable-ware of the value of 200 gold ducats or less, for which he was given permission by Pope Paul III on 16 June 1544.
1800-present.
Next to the church was a chapel, initially dedicated to James the Great and first built in 1354 by prince Louis of Taranto, husband of Joanna I of Naples. It had been handed over to the canons of Pozzuoli in 1363 and rededicated as 'San Giacomo Reale' in 1500, possibly to distinguish it from the nearby Cioffis chapel or from what is now Santa Maria della Consolazione. It was rebuilt following the eruption of Monte Nuovo in 1538 and entrusted to the confraternity dedicated to the Most Holy Body of Christ (Santissimo Corpo di Cristo), to which the chapel was rededicated at the same time. In 1817 it was annexed to the Cathedral by bishop Carlo Maria Rosini and bishop Michele Zezza linked it to the former 12th century church of Santissima Trinità (reduced to a small chapel by various rebuilds and collapses) by knocking a hole to the right of the altar. He turned the Santissimo Corpo di Cristo chapel into a parish office. The cathedral itself was declared a national monument by a royal decree of 21 November 1940 and became a minor pontifical basilica by a bull of pope Pius XII on 25 November 1959.
The central nave was completely destroyed by a fire on the night of 16–17 May 1964. It broke out in the upper regions of the wooden ceiling which covered the vaulted ceiling and became so hot that it affected the stone walls and Roman marble. The paintings were saved and re-housed in the sacristy, the Santissimo Corpo chapel, the Capodimonte, the San Martino and other museums and galleries in Naples. Restoration work began under the museologist Ezio De Felice in 1968 and for the next forty years Santa Maria della Consolazione served as the city's cathedral, with San Paolo added as a co-cathedral in 1995. The 1633 bell-tower was demolished in 1968 after removing three of its four historic bells and has not yet been replaced.
Work was delayed by the total evacuation of the Rione Terra in 1970 due to bradyseism and poor housing conditions, by bureaucratic delays, by difficulties in raising funds and by an earthquake on 23 November 1980. Accelerated bradyseism in 1983-1984 led to the monument being totally abandoned in 1992, leading to vandalism and looting. A consortium named "Rione Terra" was formed and work resumed in 1994. Finally the Regione Campania launched an architectural competition for the restoration in July 2003. This was won by a group of architects under Marco Dezzi Bardeschi.
The entrance is through the remains of the facade and the first two chapels of the Baroque cathedral, now presented as an uncovered narthex in front of the new glass facade, engraved with the destroyed front columns of the pronaos. Inside, it has a single nave formed of the ancient cella and pronaos, with the gaps between the columns along its long sides filled with glass. The temple floor has been raised back to its original level, creating an inclined stylobate floor with benches connecting to the chancel, which is on a lower level. This also creates space to display the archaeological remains of the Republican temple's podium in the basement. A new west-facing altar has been installed in the chancel, with an episcopal chair on the site of the old altar and a new marble ambo. The early 20th century frescoes in the choir have been restored and the paintings reinstated. The former sacristy and Santissimo Sacramento chapel have resumed their previous functions, now with a new tabernacle for the reserved sacrament.

Santa Maria della Consolazione, Pozzuoli

Santa Maria della Consolazione is a church dedicated to Our Lady of Consolation in Pozzuoli, Italy. 
The building originated as "San Giacomo apostolo", a church dedicated to James the Great and first built between the end of the 15th century and the start of the 16th century by Carmelite brothers from Santa Maria del Carmine, Naples. It was rebuilt early in the 1600s and totally restored in the second half of the 18th century. The Carmelites left Pozzuoli in 1807 and between 1810 and 1817 the church was rededicated by Alfonso Castaldo, bishop of Pozzuoli, to the Carmelite devotion of Our Lady of Consolation.
The church also contains an image of the Virgin Mary now known as the 'Madonna del parto' or 'Madonna of childbirth' because Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his wife Maria Theresia came to pray before it during her pregnancy. It was turned into a parish church on 11 April 1943 and from 1964 to 2014 served as the pro-cathedral for the Diocese of Pozzuoli while Pozzuoli Cathedral was being restored.

Death Warmed Up

Death Warmed Up (released in the Philippines as Dr. Evil: Part II) is a 1984 New Zealand science fiction horror splatter zombie film directed by David Blyth. It stars Michael Hurst, Margaret Umbers and Gary Day.
The film's plot centres around a young man named Michael Tucker (Hurst) seeking revenge against a mad scientist (Day), who years earlier caused him to kill his parents because he is creating zombies.
Plot.
As a child, Michael Tucker (Michael Hurst) is used as a test subject for mind control drugs developed by evil scientist Dr. Howell (Gary Day), which cause him to unwittingly kill his parents. After spending seven years in a mental institution for the murders, Michael, his girlfriend Sandy (Margaret Umbers) and his two friends Jeannie (Norelle Scott) and Lucas (William Upjohn) use Michael's car, a black 1963 Ford Fairlane 500, to set out on a trip to a remote island on which Dr. Howell's clinic is located. Desperate for revenge, Michael is determined to infiltrate the scientist's base and kill him with no mercy. After tracking him down, he kills Howell's mob of mind controlled slaves who are both zombies, but in the resulting mayhem both Jeannie and Lucas are both killed. At last Michael proceeds to brutally kill Howell after repeatedly stabbing him in the stomach with a knife. After escaping from the clinic, Michael and Sandy return to their holiday home, only to discover that it caught fire. When Michael steps out to investigate the damage, he is struck by a falling electrical line and is electrocuted to death, leaving Sandy alone weeping over the loss of him as she's overcome with grief and starting to run.
Release and response.
The film won the Grand Prix award at the 1984 Paris International Festival of Fantastic and Science-Fiction Film. Despite this, general reception to "Death Warmed Up" was mixed. Some of the covers of "Death Warmed Up" show a brain surgeon who is a skeleton who is about to use a hypodermic needle and a surgical knife to operate on the brain of a girl which doesn't represent any scene of the film.
In the Philippines, the film was released as "Dr. Evil: Part II" on May 1, 1987.
Banning in Australia.
In 1985, the film was banned by the Australian Classification Board due to excessive violence. A censored version was later released.

People's Alliance (Turkey)

The People's Alliance () is an electoral alliance in Turkey, established in February 2018 between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the opposition Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). The alliance was formed to contest the 2018 general election, and brings together the political parties supporting the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Its main rival is the Nation Alliance, which was originally created by four opposition parties in 2018 and was re-established in 2019.
History.
Background.
With the support of MHP votes in the Grand National Assembly, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan succeeded on passing the constitutional referendum in April 2017, which turned Turkey into a presidential system and would expand the executive power of the President of Turkey. Members of the MHP dissidents formed a new party, the new formed of the moderate conservative nationalist Good Party.
Since the new party formed, both AKP and MHP fear to lose votes to a new nationalist party formed by former MHP members, which oppose the MHP decided to vote for support President Erdoğan's constitutional amendment. As a result, the two parties agree to form a coalition.
Formation.
The alliance has a joint presidential candidate, incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Each party is expected to nominate candidates for parliament separately.
On 23 October 2018, after a series of public disagreements between the AKP and MHP, the MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli formally announced that his party would no longer seek to field joint candidates in prominent areas in the forthcoming March 2019 local elections. In response, Erdoğan stressed that the two parties were fundamentally different, and must go their separate ways on issues they disagreed on.
Public disagreements focussed on a general pardon for pro-MHP prisoners, as well as a court decision to annul the abolition of the Student Oath. The oath had been abolished during the Solution process by the AKP government in an attempt to appease Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) rebels, who regard its recital as racist. The court's decision to re-establish it was strongly supported by the MHP, while opposed by the AKP.
However, both parties have stressed that they do not regard this as a dissolution of the alliance in the Turkish parliament and that the suspension of the electoral alliance for the local elections is only temporary.
Composition.
Additional members.
After the formation of the alliance, there was speculation in the Turkish media, as well as among prominent analysts and politicians, that other minor parties could join it before the 24 June 2018 elections. The parties most commonly mentioned as potential future members were the Great Unity Party (BBP) and the Felicity Party (SP). While the SP ruled out joining the alliance, the BBP entered talks to join. In early May 2018, the BBP ultimately joined the alliance on the lists of the AKP, while the Felicity Party instead aligned with the opposition Nation alliance led by the Republican People' Party.
Supporting parties.
On 14 May, the Motherland Party (ANAP) announced that it would support the People's Alliance, on the basis of the political ideology of their founder, Turgut Özal. ANAP had supported 'No' in the 2017 constitutional referendum, as opposed to all other parties within the Alliance that had said 'Yes'.
On 18 May 2018, the AS Party (ASP) announced its support for the People's Alliance.
On 20 December 2019, it was reported the Patriotic Party (VP) favoured the People's Alliance.
Presidential support.
The Free Cause Party (HÜDA PAR) only supports the Alliance in the presidential election while contesting the parliamentary election as a stand-alone party,

Rione Terra

Rione Terra is a historic quarter in Pozzuoli, Italy, in the Phlegraean Fields region west of Naples. The ancient fortress originally served as the acropolis for the Greek settlement of Dicearkia before being integrated as the Roman port city of Puteoli. The densely built-up district is located on a small tufa promontory overlooking the Gulf of Pozzuoli and today serves as a tourist attraction.
History.
Rione Terra was originally a fortress for the settlement of Dicearkia founded by Greek colonists from Samos in the 6th century BCE. The fortress became the Roman colony of Puteoli in 194 BCE and was subsequently reinforced by Roman walls. An ancient Roman temple dating from this time was reconstructed as a temple for Augustus in the 1st century CE in the centre of the fortress. The temple was later converted into the Pozzuoli Cathedral ("Duomo") which stands to this day.
With its narrow and ancient streets, Rione Terra was populated until 1970 when it was evacuated due to a sudden bradyseism event that raised the hill on which the district is located by relative to sea level. The district was further damaged by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and was the subject of a restoration and excavation effort beginning in the 1980s. In 2014, Rione Terra reopened to the public as an open-air museum.

Onofrio Antonio Gisolfi

Onofrio Antonio Gisolfi (died 1656, Naples) was an Italian engineer and architect, active from 1637 until his death.
Life.
He was born in Naples and succeeded Bartolomeo Picchiatti as chief royal engineer to the Kingdom of Naples. He worked on the Regi Lagni. He was joined by Picchiatti's son Francesco Antonio Picchiatti (then still very young) to complete work on the Palazzo Reale. Whilst Gisolfi was away from the city for a time in 1645, Cosimo Fanzago made a failed attempt to take the post of chief royal engineer from him. In 1647 Gisolfi was commissioned by the Pii Operai to design and build the church of San Nicola alla Carità, completed in 1656. In 1649 Iñigo Vélez de Guevara also commissioned him to design the public Fontana della Sellaria in honour of the suppression of the Capipopolo by the Neapolitan Republic. He died in 1656, probably of plague, and the role of chief royal engineer passed to Francesco Antonio.

Feng Yidai

Feng Yidai (; 1913 – 23 February 2005) was a Chinese author, editor, and translator. Born in Hangzhou, he studied in Shanghai and thereafter began an illustrious career in publishing and editing. He was denounced as a "rightist" during Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign. He was politically rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and resumed his literary career. He married the actress and writer Huang Zongying in 1993. A few years before his death, he published his diaries and confessed his secret role as a government spy during the Anti-Rightist Campaign.
Early life and education.
He was born as Feng Yide () in 1913 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Republic of China. After graduating from the University of Shanghai with a degree in business management, Feng went on to join the publishing industry.
Career.
Feng relocated to Hong Kong in 1938, during which he helped found "Chinese Writers", an English publication, while also serving as the general editor of "Films and Writers". Together with director Mao Dun, Feng set up the China Amateur Drama Society in 1943. In the aftermath of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Feng began translating English-language novels and articles for "American Literature Series", an anthology which he also helped publish that included works like "The Fifth Column" by Ernest Hemingway.
Feng Yidai was appointed the Secretary-General of the International Press in 1949, following the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Three years later, he became the editorial director of "Chinese Literature", while also leading the Department of Foreign-Languages Publishing House. Feng's career came to a halt in 1957, when he was denounced as a rightist during the Anti-Rightist Movement. He was unable to write for the next two decades, and spent time under brutal conditions in a labour camp. His literary interests were not affected, however, as after being politically rehabilitated in the late 1970s, he founded the journal "Reading". For another twenty years, Feng continued contributing stories and articles to "Reading". In 1980, Feng toured the United States with fellow writer and translator Bian Zhilin. At the State University of New York, the duo met with American poets Alfred Poulin, Anthony Piccione, and William Heyen.
Personal life and death.
Feng married Zheng Anna (), his classmate at University of Shanghai, in 1939. During the Cultural Revolution, because of Feng's status as a "rightist", Zheng was tortured by the Red Guards and became blind in one eye. They had a daughter named Feng Tao (). After Zheng died on 7 January 1991, Feng wrote the article "An Undeliverable Letter" in her memory.
Having spent his later life in Shanghai, Feng was a close friend of Shanghainese artist Ding Cong. Feng married fellow writer and actress Huang Zongying in 1993; she was 68, and it was her fourth marriage. According to Song Yuwu in the "Biographical Dictionary of the People's Republic of China", "their love story has become legendary in the Chinese literary circle".
Having recovered from a stroke in 1996, Feng Yidai died on 23 February 2005 in Beijing, aged 92.
Confession.
In 2000, five years before his death, Feng published the diaries he had kept from July 1958 to April 1962, under the title "Hui Yu Rilu" (悔余日录; "Journal in Remorse"). The journal records his thoughts and experience after being denounced as a "rightist" during the Anti-Rightist Campaign. He was recruited by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on more prominent rightists, especially Zhang Bojun, the "No. 1 Rightist". In order to regain the grace of the Party, Feng worked diligently to ingratiate himself with Zhang and other rightists including Fei Xiaotong. He kept records of their conversations and reported the contents to his handlers. As his reward, the Party removed his "rightist" designation in 1960, but kept it secret in order not to raise suspicion.
After reading his confession, Zhang's daughter Zhang Yihe was appalled to find out that the kind family friend "Uncle Feng" was a government spy, but praised his courage for publicly confessing his sins. She recalled a conversation in which Feng said that he wanted her to be the publisher of his "final book", and felt that he had wanted to confess to her in person but could not find the courage to do so. Historian Zhu Zheng calls Feng's book "without equal" in the study of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. Although Feng received allowances from the government for his work, Zhu believes that he did not become a spy for financial reward, but had been brainwashed into believing it was the right thing to do.

Frances Margery Hext

Frances Margery Hext (1819–1896) was a local historian and author from Lostwithiel, Cornwall, best known for her work "Memorials of Lostwithiel [and of Restormell]", which continues to be referenced in studies of the history of Cornwall.
Biography.
Frances Margery Hext was born in 1819 to John Hext and his wife Elizabeth (née Staniforth). Her mother was the daughter of Thomas Staniforth, Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 1797–98 and her brother Samuel Staniforth held the same position in 1812–13. Her father is described as having inherited the family estates from his brother, and was also deputy lieutenant and deputy warden of the Stannaries. He was also a magistrate for Cornwall. Hext was also the great grand niece of Reverend Cox Macro, notable for the Macro Manuscript.
In 1882 the head of a 14th century cross was discovered in a garden in Lostwithiel. Hext paid to have the cross restored and fixed to its former shaft in the churchyard of St Bartholomew's Church.
Hext never married. She died at her home on Queen Street, Lostwithiel on 10 January 1896.
Writings.
Hext wrote and published a number of books of local significance, not only regarding the Staniforth and Hext families, but also regarding Cornish life more generally. In 1891 she published "Memorials of Lostwithiel [and of Restormell]: collected and contributed. Taken from the writings of Leland, Carew ... and others". This book continues to be referenced in historical studies of Cornwall, particularly its church monuments, and royal buildings. Other notable writings include her 1863 book "Staniforthiana: or, Recollections of the family of Staniforth of Darnall, in Yorkshire" which combined research provided by Joseph Hunter with personal family stories.

Cynthia W. Shelmerdine

Cynthia Wright Shelmerdine is an American classicist and archaeologist, known for her researches into Mycenaean culture and history. She is Robert M. Armstrong Centennial professor emerita at the University of Texas, Austin.
Education and career.
Cynthia Shelmerdine grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she attended Shady Hill School. She obtained a bachelor's degree in Greek from Bryn Mawr College in 1970 followed by a B.A. (1972) and an M.A. (1980) in Classics from the University of Cambridge. She received a doctorate in classical philology from Harvard University in 1977. Her dissertation, guided by Emily Vermeule, was titled "Late Helladic IIIA2-IIIB Pottery from Nichoria and the Bronze Age History of Messenia".
From 1977 through to her retirement in 2008, she was a member of the Classics faculty at the University of Texas at Austin. Since 2008, she has been Robert M. Armstrong Centennial professor emerita at the same institution. In 1988 she was the Gertrude Smith Professor at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens directing the Summer Session. In 2011, she was a Peter Warren Visiting Professor at Bristol University.
Research.
Shelmerdine has been praised for her integration of archaeological, philological, epigraphic and anthropological data in Mycenaean studies. Her foremost contributions have been to Late Helladic pottery, and the textual and epigraphical study of Linear B.
Between 1972 and 1975, she participated in the excavations at Nichoria and was responsible for its Late Helladic pottery. She was also a co-director at the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project from 1991 to 1996.
Pylos.
Shelmerdine's "The Perfume Industry of Mycenaean Pylos" (1985) investigated industrial production in Mycenae, establishing Linear B tablets relating to the manufacture of fragrances as an essential source of information on the Mycenaean Bronze Age. She was able to ascertain the sites of production as well as the instruments and containers used. Her analysis included the Zakro palace's room XLVII and the rooms 32 and 38 of the Pylos palace. The fragrances there were made mainly from olive oil, were considered luxury items, and produced under palatial control in a centralised fashion (unlike bronze work, which was decentralised). Every stage of the production process was documented by scribes; indeed, different products appeared to have their own specialist scribes writing the relevant tablets. Shelmerdine documented the ingredients used in several perfumes; these included henna, coriander, myrrh, honey, and "po-ni-ki-jo".
Shelmerdine considered the influence of Mycenaean perfumery on later Greek myth, especially Homeric myths. Mycenaean perfumed oils were exported to Saqqara for use among the Egyptian nobility, but later on took on the role of "ambrosial" clothing for the gods in Homeric hymns.
In the same book, Shelmerdine also documented the earliest known "drugs" in Greek history.
Iklaina.
Shelmerdine worked on the excavations at Iklaina, a secondary site within the Pylos region, as a pottery specialist. Iklaina is surmised to be an independent entity that was subsumed by the Pylian state. Shelmerdine investigated changes in cooking vessels in the period before and after this incorporation. Looking at tripods, griddles and spit supports, she showed that Iklaina's inhabitants underwent some changes in their cooking habits: they decreased their use of tripods, the diversity of cooking pots decreased, becoming more standardised after Iklaina lost its autonomy. She suggested that cooking of meats by private individuals was replaced by banquets organised by palatial elites who arranged the provision of meat.
It had previously been thought that only palatial centres of the Mycenaean culture held records. In 2010, her reading of fired tablets containing writing in Linear B at this location was a surprise. The mechanisms of Mycenaean administration had to be reinterpreted in light of this finding. The clay tablet dated to between 1490 and 1390 BCE, and had not originally been meant to be preserved. Thrown in a rubbish pile, a fire hardened it, thereby preserving it. There was writing on one side, including a number and some indecipherable characters, as well as the names of various men with numbers on the other side. Shelmerdine proposed that this was a personnel list.
It is surmised that Iklaina had a well-developed bureaucracy with scribes, and was probably an administrative centre secondary to the capital towns. Moreover, it raised the question of the extent of literacy in Mycenaean society, as well as how widespread was record-keeping at the lower echelons of Mycenaean bureaucracy.
The finding of other Linear B tablets at Iklaina, detailing the administration of textile production, also tends to weaken the thesis that Mycenaean administration was centralised. As palatial centres show little evidence of textile production, Shelmerdine suggested that the chain of textile manufacture was under a more or less distributed control. Some producers may have had no interaction at all with the palatial centres, while others might have been fully dependent.

Martin Roth (artist)

Martin Roth (October 2, 1977 in Graz – June 14, 2019 in New York City) was an Austrian artist living and working in New York City, USA after earning a master's degree from Hunter College in 2011.
Work.
Much of Roth's work revolved around the introduction of living organisms into a setting or situation circumscribed by the artist. He used living organisms as a stand in for humans, to show that they're also characters caught in conditions where they don't have control." His work, while frequently ephemeral or temporary, is saturated in space. On one level, there is the physical dimension of spaces large, and small: from the quaint miniature landscapes or rocks and plants inside glass cages, housing lizards or mice to the compact grid of a lavender field shaped by the artist's arrangement in a white cube; from the beautiful patterned garden of Persian rugs sprouting verdant grass, or the tepid lagoon created by flooding a gallery space, to the thrust of a cherry sapling through a laminate surface, demonstrating the interplay between an exposed space above and subterranean space below that characterizes several of Roth's installations. These physical settings often interweave with or generate acoustic spaces to create the conditions for – and are, in turn, shaped by – the natural organism that inhabit them. His work can be large-scale and particular to a site, the fact that it requires the nurture of living organisms renders it strangely intimate and invites the viewer if not to engage directly, at least to consider his or her relationship to the work on a human scale. Roth interrogated the increasingly blurry line between human and nonhuman systems.

Minnie Braithwaite Jenkins

Minnie Galt Braithwaite Jenkins (1874–1954) was a United States Indian Service (now known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs) school teacher and the first woman to attempt to take classes at The College of William &amp; Mary.
Biography.
Education.
Braithwaite was born in Williamsburg, Virginia. On October 2, 1896, she petitioned the faculty at the College of William &amp; Mary to allow her to attend chemistry lectures. Her petition was denied 4 to 3. Among the seven men who voted, President of the College Lyon Gardiner Tyler voted in favor of the petition and English professor John Lesslie Hall voted against it.
Career.
Braithwaite intended to travel to China as a medical missionary after being trained at William &amp; Mary to be a doctor, but this plan was derailed when her petition to attend was denied. Instead, Braithwaite began her teaching career in 1899 at the Blue Canyon Day School near the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. She later taught at the Fort Mojave School from 1902 to 1906. It was at Fort Mojave that she met and married Clarence W. Jenkins in 1906. Her memoir, Girl from Williamsburg, was published in 1951.
Legacy.
The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies department at the College of William &amp; Mary hosts an annual lecture in commemoration of her efforts to attend classes at the College.
Some of her and her family’s papers can be found in the Special Collections Research Center at Earl Gregg Swem Library. One such paper is a letter from William &amp; Mary Board of Visitors member Thomas Barnes to Braithwaite regarding her petition to attend classes at the College.

Melancholy (song)

"Melancholy" (Nepali: मिलानकोली) is an environmentally-themed song sung by 365 Nepali artists. This song was intended to promote an environmental message by breaking the Guinness World Records for "Most Vocal Solos in a Song Recording", which it successfully did. It was written, music composed and directed by environmentalist Nipesh Dhaka. The song was recorded as a single on 19 May 2016. The recording sessions were inaugurated by Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli at 8 am and continued until 6 pm. The song was released on 2 September 2017 by President Bidya Devi Bhandari at Army Officer's Club, Kathmandu.
Background and concept.
Nipesh Dhaka was involved in a variety of environmental research, as well as producing documentaries, including "Himalaya Calls" (2015), "Melancholy" (2017), and "Rodhan"(2017). He visited almost  districts of Nepal, and studied the environmental changes in different geological and ecological regions, and how they affected various communities. He also recorded a song by 206 Nepali artists in different studios of Nepal and Mumbai, including Udit Narayan Jha, Madan Krishna Shrestha, Hari Bansha Acharya, Prem Dhoj Pradhan, Vijaya Lama, Dr. Bhola Rijal, Sambhujeet Baskota and Rajesh Payal Rai. At that time he devised the concept for "Melancholy", with 365 artists collaborating on a single day.
The slogan of the song was "Raise Voice, Save Earth". The event was conducted to break the Guinness World Records of "Most Vocal Solos in a Song Recording" and use this to promote awareness of environmental conservation issues. The song was recorded at Radio Nepal by Prakash Kharel. On 1 February 2018, the song was certified by Guinness World Records.
Documentary.
The documentary Melancholy is based on environmental research studies of all geographical regions of Nepal from 2013 to 2018. The documentary explores how human beings are affecting natural resources. It also addresses global environmental problems, such as declining biodiversity, global warming, and climate change, by examining sustainable development from Nepal's point of view. The 80 minute documentary discusses the nature of the ecosystem, and considers equality, equity, dignity, culture, and social impacts of environmental change. It has been shown in many schools, colleges, clubs, mother groups, communities, and societies in Nepal, and has raised funds for 83 Chepang children of Jaldevi Primary School, Rorang Village, Dhading District. It has also been screened at international conferences and film festivals.
Guinness World Record achievement.
All 365 singers along with campaign coordinators, organizers, technicians, and volunteers were awarded Guinness World Records certificates for "Most Vocal Solos in a Song Recording", in collaboration with Nepal's Sustainable Environmental and Ecosystem Management (SEEM). This was done at a ceremony on 11 October 2018 at Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground, in the presence Minister of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Rabindra Adhikari, veteran scholar Satya Mohan Joshi, and senior singer Prem Dhoj Pradhan.

Santuario della Madonna dell'Arco

The Santuario della Madonna dell'Arco is a Roman Catholic shrine in Sant'Anastasia, a town at the feet of Mount Somma ( Mount Vesuvius' most ancient crater). It is a pilgrimage destination for the so-called 'fujenti' or 'battenti' pilgrims from all over the Campania region every Easter Monday. As they walk, they usually sing a traditional folk song first written in the 15th century and later put to music. A fire is also lit on the bell tower every second Sunday in September for the feast of the Coronation of the Virgin.
History.
The site was originally occupied by a votive aedicula, built in the 15th century and housing a Madonna and Child picture named "Madonna dell'Arco" after a nearby arch from an ancient Roman aqueduct. Tradition holds that on Easter Monday 1450 a young man was angry at losing a game of jeu de mail and threw a ball at the image, whose cheek began to bleed. This was taken as a miracle by the local people and news of it reached Raimondo Orsini, count of Sarno and grand justiciar of the Kingdom of Naples, who put the young man on trial. He was condemned to death and hanged next to the votive aedicula.
On Easter Monday 1589, during the feast of the Madonna dell'Arco, a woman from the town named Aurelia Del Prete went to the shrine with her husband Marco Cennamo to offer an ex voto depicting the Madonna after recovering the man from a serious eye disease. The woman had a piglet with her, but it got loose and she could not get it back from among the crowd, so Aurelia angrily cursed her husband's ex voto depicting the Madonna. The following year she fell gravely ill and soon died on 28 July 1590. The illness made her feet fall off, and they are still kept locked in a small iron cage in the shrine.
The cult began to spread beyond Naples and in 1592 pope Clement VIII sent father Giovanni Leonardi from Rome to Naples to cooperate with the bishop of Nola in administering the shrine's almsgiving and lands. The first stone of the current sanctuary was laid in 1593 and two years later it was handed over to the Dominicans, who began enlarging it. However, due to tensions with the Reale Albergo dei Poveri (who still held onto part of the monastery) and various collapses, it only reached its final form in 1973. On 25 March 1676 viceroy Antonio Alvarez and cardinal Pier Francesco Orsini (future Pope Benedict XIII) saw the sanctuary's image of Mary surrounded by stars.
Architecture.
The complex includes a convent, the bell tower, and the main church. The inside of the shrine has a Latin cross plan with a single barrel-vaulted nave having four chapels on each side. In the middle of the transept there is the votive aedicula housing the Madonna and Child picture.
The columns are covered by votive tablets called 'ex voto' dedicated to the Madonna. They are an authentic expression of four centuries of popular art. From the 15th century on, they depict both episodes of the everyday life and the state of poverty of the people from the Campania region.

Team Sonic Racing

Team Sonic Racing is a 2019 kart racing game and a spin-off from Sega's "Sonic the Hedgehog" series. Controlling one of 15 characters from the series' cast, players compete in races using sports cars. They view gameplay from a third-person perspective while performing tricks, drifting, and collecting power-ups. "Team Sonic Racing" differs from traditional kart racers because of its focus on cooperative gameplay, similar to the kind featured in "Splatoon" (2015) and "Overwatch" (2016)—players are part of a team of racers and win races through efficiency rather than speed. Game modes include competing to earn points, time trials, customizing the racing rules, and a story-driven tutorial campaign.
Sumo Digital, which had previously worked on "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing" (2010) and "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed" (2012), developed "Team Sonic Racing". Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka conceived the cooperative gameplay, and Sumo Digital used the team-based "Sonic Heroes" (2003) as a point of reference. Unlike Sumo Digital's previous racing games, "Team Sonic Racing" only features "Sonic" characters, as the team wanted to expand the series' world and character roster. They aimed to make the game stand out compared to other racing games and developed it using a modified version of the "All-Stars" game engine. Musician Jun Senoue, who had not contributed to a major "Sonic" game since "Generations" (2011), composed the soundtrack.
"Team Sonic Racing" existence came to light when a Sumo Digital memo leaked in January 2018, with Sega confirming it the following May. Its marketing campaign included appearances at trade shows, a one-shot comic from IDW Publishing, and a two-part animated series. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2019. A simplified version for iOS developed by Hardlight, Sonic Racing, was released via Apple Arcade in September 2019. The game was later re-released on Amazon Luna in March 2021. "Team Sonic Racing" received mixed reviews; its team-based gameplay, track designs, and music were praised, but the story mode and voice acting were criticized. Critics also considered it inferior to the "Sega-All Stars" games.
Gameplay.
"Team Sonic Racing" is a "Sonic the Hedgehog"-themed kart racing game featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. After selecting one of 15 characters from the series' cast, players participate in races using sports cars on courses thematically based on locations from the franchise. There are three types of racing classes: speed, technique, and power. Each type has its own unique abilities; for example, technique racers like Tails can drive over rough surfaces like grass without slowing down. The player views gameplay from a third-person perspective and runs over panels to get speed boosts, performs tricks in midair, and drifts to make sharp turns. Power-ups called Wisps can be collected from canisters with "?" marks and grant players temporary offensive and defensive advantages.
The gameplay differs from traditional racing games because of its focus on cooperative gameplay: the player is part of a team of racers and they must work together. While each player in a team still takes control of a single racer, they must also pay attention to how teammates are performing and share power-ups. Instead of winning races by simply finishing first, teams get points based on how they worked together. Thus, the most efficient team wins. Four teams of three compete, for a total of twelve racers at a time. Any character can be in a team; the player also has the option for each teammate to be the same character. Working together causes an "Ultimate" meter to be filled. When full, it can be activated to gain a temporary burst of speed. The meter's duration can be extended by hitting competing racers.
There are 21 tracks in total, including some returning from "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing" (2010) and "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed" (2012), each split across seven zones and based on locations from main "Sonic" games. "Team Sonic Racing" features a variety of game modes, including Grand Prix, in which players compete to earn points; Time Trial, in which players race for the fastest time possible; and Exhibition, in which players can customize the racing rules. One mode, "Team Adventure", is a story-driven campaign that also includes a tutorial, as well as an original story explaining why the characters are racing. It is divided into chapters and players must complete missions like collecting as many rings as possible. Unlike the main game, the teams in Team Adventure are predetermined. Progressing through Team Adventure will unlock extras that can be used in the other modes.
Players can customize their vehicles, with new parts unlocked as they progress through the game. Customization options can be purchased using in-game currency called Mod Pods, which are earned by competing in races. Parts modify cars' handling, boost, acceleration, defense, and top speed, and players can also make aesthetic changes such as paint jobs and horn sounds. The game supports four-player local multiplayer, up to twelve online, and up to three in Team Adventure.
Plot.
An alien tanuki named Dodon Pa sends invitations to Sonic the Hedgehog and several of his friends, inviting them to compete in a series of team-based races. He builds cars outfitted with advanced technology for each of the racers, offering them as a prize for the winning team. Though they are skeptical of Dodon Pa's motivations, Sonic and the others agree. The competition takes them across the world, with Dodon Pa pitting them against increasingly difficult challenges.
The racers remain suspicious of Dodon Pa, believing he may be working with Sonic's longtime nemesis Doctor Eggman. Investigating further, they discover he is king of the planet Donpa Kingdom and the president of the Donpa Motors automotive corporation. The company is constructing an Ultimate Energy Engine, which gains power from teamwork. Intending it for philanthropic use, Dodon Pa has been using the races to gather research data for the engine and generate energy to power it.
After unsuccessfully attempting to steal the engine, Eggman and his henchmen kidnap Dodon Pa and hold him hostage on their battleship. Eggman deceives Dodon Pa into finishing the engine for him, forcing Sonic and the others to continue racing to power it. Eggman installs the engine into a doomsday robot, but it goes haywire and destroys the battleship. Sonic and his friends manage to rescue Dodon Pa as the ship explodes, though the cars are destroyed in the process. A grateful Dodon Pa builds everyone new cars, and they prepare to race again.
Development.
The British video game developer Sumo Digital developed "Team Sonic Racing" for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was Sumo Digital's third racing game featuring the "Sonic" intellectual property (IP), following "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing" and "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed". Sega chose Sumo Digital to develop the game because of its experience with the "Sonic" IP. Development began before the completion of "Sonic Mania" and "Sonic Forces" in 2017. Unlike those games, which featured action-oriented gameplay, "Team Sonic Racing" was aimed at casual gamers. The majority of the staff did not work on the previous games, although some who did were contacted for advice. The lead designer of the game was Richard Acherki, while Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka served as producer. "Team Sonic Racing" was Acherki's first game at Sumo Digital. According to Acherki, the proprietary game engine "Team Sonic Racing" runs on is a modified version of the one used to develop the "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing" games, and allowed them to easily port the game across platforms.
Unlike the "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars" games, which featured various Sega franchises, "Team Sonic Racing" solely focuses on "Sonic". Sega's community manager Aaron Webber said that "Team Sonic Racing" is not a sequel to "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed" and is "very, very different" from previous "Sonic" racers. Iizuka explained that the team wanted to make a game that took place solely in the "Sonic" universe, which is why it does not bear the "All-Stars" name. He noted Sega used to release a variety of racing games such as "Out Run" (1986) and "Daytona USA" (1992), and said "Team Sonic Racing" continues this tradition. Webber added that the team wanted to expand the world and character roster of "Sonic", and designer Derek Littlewood said setting the game in the "Sonic" universe allowed them use to the series' "full suite" of characters and elements. One of Sumo Digital's goals was to "provide plenty of fan service and also [give] people something new to look at and experience." Designer Ben Wilson called working on a "Sonic" game "surreal" and said the team enjoyed working with Sega. The game does not support cross-platform multiplayer, which Iizuka stated is because of technical constraints.
Sumo Digital wanted to make "Team Sonic Racing" stand out compared to other racing games, and with the engine of previous games they had a solid foundation to build a new experience. Iizuka suggested that they design it so it was easy for beginners. Sumo Digital also wanted to build on the gameplay of "Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed", which many players enjoyed. Iizuka conceived the team-based gameplay after watching his son play a kart racing game with his friends. He observed that they were not all happy and pondered how they could all enjoy the game. Observing other games, Sumo Digital found that team gameplay was popular; noting that racing games were largely single-player experiences, they decided combining the concepts would create a unique and exciting experience. Iizuka said Sumo Digital was not inspired by other kart racing games like "Mario Kart 8" (2014) because the team wanted to make a game that emphasized teamwork instead of "a network game", citing "Splatoon" (2015) and "Overwatch" (2016) as examples of the cooperative gameplay "Team Sonic Racing" was designed to resemble. He also found it surprising there were few team-based racing games available.
Designing the game was challenging because the teamwork aspect was an unusual concept for a racing game. Iizuka and the team found that, if the cooperative gameplay was too prominent, it would hamper with the fluidity of the gameplay. Sumo Digital used "Sonic Heroes" (2003), which features team-based gameplay, as a point of reference. Other difficulties arose from choosing characters for the roster. For instance, Vector the Crocodile, traditionally seen as a member of the Chaotix in "Sonic" games, is paired with Blaze the Cat and Silver the Hedgehog in "Team Sonic Racing", which led to considerable debate among the team. They also had a hard time choosing courses with a variety of atmospheres. Each character received a unique car designed to reflect their individuality, while custom parts were made separately. "Team Sonic Racing" features several new versions of the Wisp power-ups from previous "Sonic" games. The "Sega All-Stars" games included general power-ups since they featured multiple franchises, but since "Team Sonic Racing" features simply "Sonic", Sumo Digital unified the power-ups with Wisps. The team worked with the Japanese Sonic Team staff to get approval for their concepts.
Jun Senoue composed the soundtrack in his first major work in the "Sonic" series since "Sonic Generations" (2011), while Richard Jacques, Tee Lopes, Tyler Smyth of DangerKids, Tomoya Ohtani, chip-tune artist TORIENA and the EDM group Hyper Potions also contributed. The game's theme song, "Green Light Ride", was performed by Senoue's band Crush 40. Iizuka said the team needed "cool" music that would "influence the player's excitement", which led him to ask Senoue to compose the score. He composed each track individually, collaborating with a different musician for each one.
Promotion and release.
Rumors of a new "Sonic" racing game arose in January 2018, when an internal Sumo Digital memo mentioning an "unannounced karting game" based on an "established global IP" leaked. Sumo Digital's history with "Sonic" caused speculation that it was developing a new "Sega All-Stars" title, which Webber denied. Despite his response, several toy companies alluded to a future "Sonic" kart racing game in February 2018. For example, a representative for the company Zappies reported at the Spielwarenmesse toy fair in Nuremberg that a third "Sonic" kart racing game was in development and that it planned to produce promotional toy figures. "Sonic" fans noted Webber's comments just alluded to the "Sega All-Stars" name and did not discount the premise of a new "Sonic" racing game, and further rumors of a game without any other Sega IPs involved arose later in February. Sega scheduled a "Sonic"-related announcement for its March 16, 2018 show at the SXSW convention. While Sega did not reveal the racing game there, the official series Twitter account teased it.
In May 2018, after the game leaked in a Walmart retail listing, Sega confirmed "Team Sonic Racing" was in development. "Eurogamer" expressed disappointment that it did not include any non-"Sonic" characters as playable racers, which its writer believed was one of the best things about "Sonic &amp; Sega All Stars Racing" and its sequel. However, he remained optimistic, believing Sumo Digital's experience with "Sonic" would ensure the game would be a similar, "fundamentally brilliant arcade racer". Sega initially slated "Team Sonic Racing" for release in late 2018, but delayed it to May 21, 2019, that October to give Sumo Digital more development time. Iizuka later clarified that there were problems with the online mode that took more time than anticipated to fix.
A demo version was playable at E3 2018 in June. The demo, which featured one track and six playable characters, was described by "Kotaku" as underwhelming, unfavorably comparing it to "Mario Kart". "Kotaku" argued the demo lacked ambition and called its character lineup shallow, especially when compared to that of "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed". A more optimistic opinion came from "IGN": although he considered the power-ups generic, the writer felt the game still had a good foundation and that the team gameplay was satisfying. "Hardcore Gamer" nominated it as E3's best racing game, but it lost to "Forza Horizon 4". Sega released a trailer to promote the game at E3, featuring the theme song and an in-depth look at the gameplay. Another demo was playable at Gamescom in August 2018. More details were revealed, including the new character Dodon Pa, aspects of the story, and racetracks based on levels in "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" (1994) and "Sonic Unleashed" (2008). The game won the "Best Casual Game" award at the 2018 Gamescom Awards. "Team Sonic Racing" was also present at PAX West in August, where attendees were given an exclusive poster, and the Tokyo Game Show in November.
IDW Publishing released a promotional one-shot comic book, written by "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" scribe Caleb Goellner and illustrated by "Sonic" comic artist Adam Bryce Thomas, in December 2018. The story is set before the game's events and features Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and their friends traveling to a mysterious planet and preventing "an old foe" from obtaining new technology. At SXSW in March 2019, the first episode of a two-part tie-in animated series, "Team Sonic Racing Overdrive", was released, followed by the second episode in April. The series' animation was handled by Tyson Hesse and Neko Production, who previously produced the "Sonic Mania" (2017) tie-in "Sonic Mania Adventures". On launch day, Sega released a live-action trailer set in a supermarket, featuring a cameo from Iizuka. Sumo Digital chose to offer all content at launch instead of selling some as downloadable content, and not to include microtransactions.
"Sonic Racing", a simplified version developed by Hardlight, was released for iOS on September 19, 2019, as a launch title for Apple's Apple Arcade subscription service. The game was released as part of a deal between Apple and Sega, and Sega does not plan to release it on other platforms.
Reception.
According to review aggregator Metacritic, "Team Sonic Racing" received "mixed or average reviews". "Screen Rant" observed that critics generally deemed it fun but inferior to the "Sega All-Stars" titles and "Mario Kart 8", which they felt were presented better.
Many critics of the game praised the team-based game play and the track designs as well. "IGN" stated, "Team Sonic Racing nails what matters most: speed and finesse on the racetrack. The new team system is a fantastic evolution of the arcade racing formula that gives you a real reason to work together, and there’s a litany of customization options to keep you coming back to these excellent tracks to earn more." Brian Shia of "Game Informer" stated, "Team Sonic Racing delivers a fun, easy-to-play experience that bolsters its adequate gameplay with distinct flavors to help it stand out from the rest of the genre." "Nintendo Life" gave the game a positive review, stating, "It’s strangely satisfying when you send some rockets to your 7th place chum and see their ranking climb a few moments later. Even though you’re just watching a number change, there’s an odd feeling of teamwork done well."
Many were critical of the game's story mode. Game Informer also stated, "The Team Adventure story mode is an inconsequential narrative told through still character images over background environments, making the uninteresting plot even less engaging." "GamesRadar+" was also critical of the game's story mode stating, "Team Sonic Racing's campaign includes seven chapters of races, as well as other types of modes like ring collection, target smashes, and elimination rounds, tied together by horribly boring cutscenes made up of static character art. If you're looking to handle the majority of this one alone then the campaign will be your only option. Outside time trials, local play, and online multiplayer, there isn't much else you can play through when you first start out."
Sales.
The Nintendo Switch version of "Team Sonic Racing" sold 3,339 copies during its first week on sale in Japan, making it the thirteenth bestselling retail game of the week. The PlayStation 4 version sold 2,432 copies during the same week, placing it at number sixteen on the retail chart. It debuted at the top of the UK all-format sales charts—the first "Sonic" game to do so since "Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games" in 2008—with the PlayStation 4 version selling the most copies. Its launch sales doubled that of "Sonic &amp; AllStars Racing: Transformed".
Awards.
The game was nominated for best racing game at the 2018 Game Critics Awards and 2019 Independent Game Developers' Association Awards.

Alex van der Zwaan

Alex Rolf van der Zwaan (; born September 1984) is a Belgian-born Dutch attorney formerly with the London branch of New York-based international law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
On 20 February 2018, he pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to investigators while answering questions about Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. He served 30 days in prison and was fined $20,000. After serving his sentence, Van der Zwaan was deported to the Netherlands. He was later pardoned in December 2020 by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Justice was his firm's client and central to the indictment. In 2017, Skadden Arps refunded $567,000 billed by the firm to the Government of Ukraine.
Education and career.
Van der Zwaan, a Dutch citizen, was born in Brussels, Belgium, in 1984. He received his LL.B. at King's College London in 2006, and completing his Legal Practice Course at BPP Law School in 2007. He was admitted to practice law as a solicitor in England and Wales in September 2009.
He began working at the London office of the international law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in 2007. At the firm, he worked on complex matters, including the freezing of assets of the rich, a legal tactic attempted by companies and billionaires in disputes with business partners. He repeatedly assisted Ukrainian oligarch Gennadiy Bogolyubov, whose assets were at risk of being frozen by the London High Court on several occasions.
His work at the firm also included representing corporations, individuals and sovereign entities in various matters, including high-value and complex commercial litigation and arbitration, and government agency investigations. He assisted Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's businesses in relation to mining assets in Ukraine.
In November 2017, Van der Zwaan was fired from Skadden Arps for gross misconduct due to the false statements he made to the United States Special Counsel's Office. On 3 July 2019, Van der Zwaan was struck off the Roll of Solicitors in England and Wales following a judgment of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal that he had acted dishonestly by knowingly and intentionally giving the Special Counsel's Office false information.
Work on Skadden Arps' Ukrainian report, and criminal conviction.
Van der Zwaan, who speaks Russian, was one of the eight attorneys who worked on Skadden Arps's 2012 report, commissioned by the government of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych via Paul Manafort, that defended the prosecution, conviction and imprisonment of Yanukovych's rival, the country's former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Van der Zwaan worked closely with Gregory B. Craig in preparing the report, assisting with fact-finding and attending meetings in Ukraine. He also served as rule-of-law consultant to the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. In a 2017 interview former United States ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst said that Skadden Arps "should have been ashamed" of the report, calling it "a nasty piece of work".
In February 2018, Special Counsel investigation prosecutor Andrew Weissmann stated that, as part of Manafort's and Rick Gates's lobbying effort to improve Yanukovych's reputation in the United States, Van der Zwaan took an advance copy of the report in late July or early August 2012 without authorization, and gave it to a public-relations firm working for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice—with one aim being to get the report published in "The New York Times"—and in September 2012 gave Gates talking points about the report. Prosecutors also said Van der Zwaan deleted emails sought by the special counsel's office—such as emails between him and Manafort associate Konstantin Kilimnik (known as "Person A"), including one requesting that Van der Zwaan use encrypted communications and one from September 2016—rather than turning them over to Skadden Arps, which was gathering documents for the special counsel.
In a 3 November 2017 interview with Special Counsel prosecutors and FBI agents, Van der Zwaan maintained that his last communication with Gates was an innocuous text in mid-August 2016 and that his last contact with Kilimnik was a 2014 discussion of the latter's family; prosecutors determined instead that he had discussed the 2012 Skadden Arps report with Gates and Kilimnik in September 2016 during phone calls that he surreptitiously recorded. Van der Zwaan acknowledged to Special Counsel investigators in an interview that Gates had told him of Kilimnik's ties to the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a Russian military intelligence agency.
On 20 February 2018, Van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to investigators. In his plea, he admitted to email deletions, and to lying when he told investigators that he had only a "passive role in the rollout of the report". The guilty plea did not include an agreement to cooperate with the Mueller investigation.
At his sentencing hearing on 3 April 2018, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison followed by two months of supervised release, and fined $20,000.
He was Disbarred by the United Kingdom's Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal on 11 July 2019. 
In December 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned Van der Zwaan in an eleventh-hour pardon prior to the end of Trump's four-year presidential term. The pardon rescinds his U.S. criminal record, allowing him to legally return to the United States.
Personal life.
, Van der Zwaan lives in London. In June 2017, he married Eva Khan, daughter of the Russian billionaire German Khan, co-founder and co-owner of Alfa Group. German Khan is suing "BuzzFeed" and the private investigation firm Fusion GPS over "BuzzFeed's" publication of the Trump–Russia dossier containing information about Trump's ties to Russia. Van der Zwaan has Russian roots and has worked with a number of Russian oligarchs. In addition to Dutch, he speaks fluent English, Russian, and French.

Michael W. Twitty

Michael W. Twitty (born 1977) is an African-American Jewish writer, culinary historian, and educator. He is the author of "", published by HarperCollins/Amistad, which won the 2018 James Beard Foundation Book Award for Book of the Year as well as the category for writing. The book was also a finalist for The Kirkus Prize in nonfiction, the Art of Eating Prize and a Barnes and Noble New Discoveries finalist in nonfiction.
Early life and education.
Twitty was born in Washington, D.C. in 1977. According to historic records and data from DNA testing, his ancestors were originally Mende people from Sierra Leone, Akan people from Ghana and British and Irish immigrants whose descendants owned slaves. Twitty's great-great grandfather, Elijah Mitchell, was on a nearby street when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at the Appomattox Court House, ending the American Civil War.
Twitty first became interested in traditional cooking as a child when he went on a trip to Colonial Williamsburg. He majored in African-American studies and anthropology at Howard University, but did not finish due to financial constraints.
Career.
In 2010, he launched Afroculinaria, a culinary history blog that covers African and African-American foodways. In 2010, Twitty worked with the D. Landreth Seed Company to compile the African American Heritage Collection of heirloom seeds for the company's 225th anniversary. The collection features roughly 30 plants, including the long-handled dipper gourd and the fish pepper, showcasing how instrumental they were to African-American survival and independence. In 2011, he began his "Cooking Gene" project, which would form the basis for his 2017 James Beard Award-winning book "The Cooking Gene". He is writing another book slated to come out in 2020, titled "Kosher Soul".
Twitty founded and oversees the Southern Discomfort Tour, a journey through the American South designed to raise awareness about the impact racism had on Southern cuisine. As part of this project, Twitty recreates the experiences of his slave ancestors, picking cotton, chopping wood, working in fields, and cooking in plantation kitchens.
In 2013, Twitty gained greater media attention when he published an open letter to Paula Deen after she was fired from the Food Network. That same year he spoke at the MAD symposium in Copenhagen after being invited by Rene Redzepi, owner of NOMA. In 2016, he traveled to Vancouver to give a TED talk entitled "Gastronomy and the social justice reality of food". In 2016, Twitty received the inaugural Culinary Pioneer Award from Tastetalks and won both readers choice and editors choice for his letter to chef Sean Brock on Afroculinaria from Saveur. In January 2017, Colonial Williamsburg named Twitty its first Revolutionary in Residence.
Twitty has become an icon in his efforts to change food and culinary injustices that have been a prevalent problem in African American communities and traces to African roots to help the public understand how African-American food shaped American cuisine.
Personal life.
Twitty is openly gay. He was raised nominally Christian and converted to Judaism at age 25. He married Taylor Keith on October 1, 2020.

Weymouth Guildhall

Weymouth Guildhall is a former guildhall at Weymouth, Dorset, England. The building, which was constructed in the 1830s, is a Grade II* listed building.
History.
Weymouth Guildhall was designed by Talbot Bury and constructed between 1836 and 1837. It was built of Portland stone and includes a "tall projecting portico" and "grand entrance hall". Opened on 25 June 1838, the local council used the upper floor council chamber and court room, while a police station, including cells, was established on the ground floor. The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England described the building as a "suitably dignified building" with a "formal classical statement", but added that it "cannot be fully appreciated as it faces a narrow street". The design included a portico, arcaded on the ground floor, with four large Ionic order columns at the first floor level and a pediment above.
Upon its completion, the guildhall replaced the existing facilities of the Melcombe Regis Town Hall, which had been on the same site, and Weymouth Town Hall. Petty sessions for Portland and district were held in the courtroom while the chief of the borough police was based in the police station.
The police relocated to new premises on the Dorchester Road in 1955; however the Weymouth &amp; Portland Borough Council continued to use the building for meetings into the 21st century. In 2010, some members of the council called for the building to be sold. Most of the building was vacant and it faced essential repair costs. By then the building was still home to the registry office, and an area was in use by the Weymouth Community Volunteers; however the council were holding only a few meetings there each year. The council carried out some essential repair work in 2013 and then sold the building to James Braxton of Antiques Road Trip fame in 2014. At the time, Braxton announced his intention to preserve the building's history and "bring access back" by using the building as both a wedding venue and family holiday lets.
Interesting items inside the guildhall include a 16th century chest in the courtroom, the Royal Arms of King James VI and I, of King George I and of Queen Victoria in the council chamber and a white marble statue of the former mayor, Samuel Weston, on the staircase.

Giulio Cesare Fontana

Giulio Cesare Fontana (12 February 1580, Rome - 9 June 1627, Naples) was an Italian architect and engineer, mainly active in Naples and its surroundings.
Life.
He was the son of Elisabetta Paduschi and her husband, the architect Domenico Fontana. He trained in the studios headed by his father, his uncle Giovanni Fontana, his cousin Carlo Maderno, Matteo Castelli and Girolamo Rainaldi. He and his father travelled to the Kingdom of Naples to design the "Dogana nuova" (1594) and the crypt of the Duomo di Salerno and the Duomo di Amalfi - Giulio Cesare was director of works on both these crypts until 1612. He also summoned Bartolomeo Picchiatti from Ferrara as a collaborator.
In 1607, following his father's death, he became chief royal architect of the Kingdom, restoring Castel Nuovo and leading work on the Palazzo Reale. That same year he took part in the competition to design the Royal Chapel of the Treasure of St. Januarius organised by the Deputazione della Real Cappella del Tesoro. Other competitors included Ceccardo Bernucci, Giovan Battista Cavagna, Francesco Grimaldi, Giovanni Cola di Franco, Michelangelo Naccherino, Dionisio Nencioni di Bartolomeo and Giovan Giacomo Di Conforto. A commission in Rome judged the competition and the designs by father Grimaldi and Giovanni Cola di Franco were declared the winning entries.
In 1612 viceroy Pedro Fernández de Castro, count of Lemos, commissioned him to convert the former cavallerizza into the Palazzo dei Regi Studi, which now houses the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli - nel frattempo operò nella sistemazione dei Regi Lagni. Around the same time he designed the grain pits in Largo Mercatello (now Piazza Dante) in Naples and worked on the Regi Lagni. In 1626 he designed the portale dell'Annunziata gateway in Aversa, took part in completing the oratory of San Carlo Borromeo near the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi - that church also contains the funerary monument to Domenico Fontana, designed by Giulio Cesare in 1627 but badly damaged during World War Two.

<doc id="56640023" url="?curid=56640023" title="Kanō Sadanobu">
Kanō Sadanobu

Kanō Sadanobu (, 22 May 1597 – 12 November 1623) was a Japanese painter of the Kanō school. He was the son of the Kanō Mitsunobu, who lost a great deal of the main Kanō school's patronage and prestige. Sadanobu was Mitsunobu's only son and seventh head of the Kanō house descending directly from founded Kanō Masanobu.
It was the intention of Mitsunobu's brother, Kanō Takanobu, to have his son, Kanō Tan'yū, remain in Kyoto as designated heir to his father's sub-branch of the Kano school workshop. However, Tan'yū accepted the title of "goyō eshi" in 1617 and began to plan his atelier in Edo, most likely with the Tokugawa shōgun's approval. This moved Tan'yū's younger brother, Kanō Naonobu, up as to succeed the family workshop in Kyoto upon Takanobu's death. However, in 1630 the city of Edo was flourishing and Naonobu was also made "goyō eshi" and given his own parcel of land at Takegawachō in Edo, where he then built his residence and studio. The main Kanō-school workshop, led by Sandanobu by this time, remained in Kyoto, either by instruction of the "shōgun" or Sandanbou's own will. However, he had no brothers or children he could designate as heir by the time of his passing in 1623.
As a result of Sadanobu leaving no heir, the Kyoto workshop fell into the hands of another Kanō Takanobu child, Kanō Yasunobu. Although Yasunobu was adopted into the main Kyoto house upon Sadanobu's death, sometime during 1624–1643 he too was appointed "goyō eshi" by Tokugawa and moved to Edo to build his workshop known as Nakabashi. However, Yasunobu did not give up his claim to headship of the main house in order to make his move and still considered his branch the main Kanō house.

José Miguel Arenas Beltrán (born 18 December 1993), popularly known as Valtònyc, is a Spanish rapper, originally from Mallorca, Spain. He defines himself as an independentist. His lyrics are based on an anti-capitalist, republican and anti-fascist ideology.
Biography.
José Miguel Arenas Beltran is from the island of Mallorca. He was a seller of fruit and vegetables. He is also a rapper, but was not well known before his legal proceedings.
Legal problems.
He was arrested on 23 August 2012 when he was 18.
In February 2018, the Supreme Court of Spain confirmed his sentence by the Audiencia Nacional of three and a half years in jail after being convicted of slander, Lèse-majesté, and glorifying terrorism in his lyrics. Court papers referenced lyrics "supporting and praising" ETA, GRAPO, wishing death on politicians and members of the Spanish Royal Family. Afterwards he stated on several occasions that it was the Second Deputy Prime Minister, Pablo Iglesias Turrión, who instructed him to compose the song against the Royal Family.
Valtònyc is believed to be the first Spanish musician to be imprisoned for his lyrics since the 1977 restoration of democracy in Spain.
On 23 May 2018, the day before he was to enter prison, it was reported that he had fled to Belgium to avoid arrest.
On 5 July, he reported to the police in the Belgian city of Ghent, following a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Spanish authorities to have him extradited to Spain. He was heard by an examining judge of the tribunal of first instance of Ghent, who decided there was no reason to assume he would try to flee from Belgium.
Valtònyc was released under conditions later that day. The spokesperson of the prosecutor's office of Ghent stated additional documents have been requested from the Spanish authorities. When those would be made available, the court's ("counsel chamber") was to decide whether Valtònyc would be extradited. The court of Ghent had previously refused to extradite some Spanish fugitives in its history, such as María Natividad Jauregui Espina, who was accused by the Spanish authorities of having been involved in ETA terrorist attacks in 1981.
The Ghent court of appeal sought a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice in the matter. The standard of double criminality under the European Arrest Warrant system requires that the offence for which extradition is sought be punishable in both countries by a term of imprisonment of at least three years. The Spanish penal code was amended in 2015 to lengthen the prison term for the offence of glorifying terrorism. The ECJ ruled that the Ghent Court of Appeal should refer to the Spanish penal code as it stood in 2012 (when Valtònyc wrote the lyrics in question), rather than 2018 when Spain requested extradition.

Giuliano Periccioli

Giuliano Periccioli (active 1639-1649) was an Italian engraver and cartographer.
He is said to have been born in Siena, but notes indicate he was hired by Charles I, King of England, to draw scenes from the Levant, and he traveled to England, after having been to Constantinople, Candia, Rhodes, Alexandria, Sicily and Spain. Prince Rupert of the Rhine brought him to the Siege of Breda. He then went to France, and the King of England, having recalled him, tried to send him to Italy in 1639. He then entered the service of Mattias de' Medici, Prince of Tuscany, who procured for him the Grand Duke, where he engraved various events. Some of the drawings in plates of the book "Arcano del mare del duca di Nortumbria", whose nautical charts were drawn up by Lucas Holstenius are attributed to Periccioli. Jacques Callot is said to engraved after one of his designs.

Marlies Krämer

Marlies Krämer is a feminist and politician (born 1937 in Illingen). In 1996 she was a force in initiating the renaming of low-pressure areas in Germany, from formerly female names to a new naming system. Since 1998 these have been given female names one year and the following year male names are used instead.
After WW2 she started an apprenticeship in retailing. In 1958 she married. She gave birth to 4 children. Her husband died in 1972. From 1987 until 1994 she became a member of the city council of Sulzbach. In the 1990s when her ID Card needed to be extended she was not willing to accept this identity document, which addressed her as Inhaber (in German a male title indicating the holder of the card) instead of Inhaberin (the female form of the title).
In 2018 she went to court (Federal Court of Justice or BGH) with the savings bank Sparkasse over how to address a bank account holder properly. Krämer shared the opinion that she does not want to be addressed as a Kunde, because it is a form of address that is not suitable for a female customer. The German language differentiates between a male variant of customer with Kunde and a female one, Kundin.
The court rejected her claim and she lost the case. The ruling (Accession number: VI ZR 143/17) stated, the current practice is not gender discrimination.
On 8 March 2020 Marlies Krämer received the Women's Award of the state Rhineland Palatinate in Mainz.

African Lodge No. 459

African Lodge, No. 459 was the founding lodge of Prince Hall Freemasonry. It is the lodge from which all modern Prince Hall Lodges trace their descent.
History.
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Prince Hall and fourteen other free black men petitioned for admittance to the (at that time all white) Boston St. John’s Lodge. They were turned down. Having been rejected by colonial Freemasonry, they petitioned to join a Masonic lodge attached to the 38th British Foot Infantry (then meeting at Castle William Island in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts) which operated under a charter from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. 
They were accepted, becoming the first black men to be initiated into a Masonic Lodge in America. The regiment left Boston shortly after the start of the American Revolution, taking its lodge with it. Prince Hall and his associates received a "permit" from the Grand Lodge of Ireland to meet for the purpose of Masonic funeral services and processions. Under this permit, African Lodge was organized on July 3, 1776. Prince Hall was elected Worshipful Master. This permit, however, was limited. It did not allow them to do any "masonic work" or to take in any new members. 
Hall then applied to the Grand Lodge of England for a more complete warrant (or charter). This request was granted on September 29, 1784, when H. R. H. The Duke of Cumberland (Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England) issued a charter for "The African Lodge No. 1" (later renamed African Lodge No. 459.
From Lodge to Grand Lodge.
With a charter, African Lodge #459 could initiate more men from the free black community in Boston. In 1797 Prince Hall organized subsidiary lodges in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Providence, Rhode Island. These operated under the charter of African Lodge (and initially were also given the name "African Lodge" and the number "459". The Lodge in Providence soon changed its name to Hiram Lodge #3). In December 1808, these three lodges met and formed the African Grand Lodge (sometime referred to as African Grand Lodge #1) and elected Prince Hall as Grand Master. In 1847, the African Grand Lodge changed its name to the Prince Hall Grand Lodge, in honor of their founding Grand Master. Other Prince Hall Grand Lodges were formed in other states, and today there are 47 Prince Hall Grand Lodges who trace their lineage to the original African Lodge.

The "Register of Shipping" for 1816 gave the name of her master as Armnan, her owner as Hogg &amp; Co., and her trade as London transport.
"Lord Melville", Thomas Arman, master, was in company with and "Boadicea" on 30 January 1816. These ships were travelling together carrying soldiers and their families to Cork at the end of the Napoleonic War when all three wrecked, two with heavy loss of life.
"Lord Melville" failed to clear Kinsale Head and was driven onto a shoal 300 metres (330 yards) from the shore. However she did not break up. Her only losses occurred when a boat was launched containing four women, one child, and eight men; this boat foundered and only one person survived. The remainder of her crew and of the 479 passengers survived; they left the ship after the gale subsided overnight.

Jatayu (book)

Jatayu is a Gujarati poetry collection by Sitanshu Yashaschandra published in 1986. It is a collection of surrealistic poems based on Indian mythology, romantic temper, modern consciousness, and nature. It won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1987.
Contents.
Jatayu includes 34 poems divided into eight mutually unconnected sections. Each section has a line or a stanza taken from a poem to serve as a caption. The critic Dhirubhai Thaker has classified these poems in five categories; surrealistic poems, poems based on Indian mythology, poems of romantic temper, nature poems, and poems reflecting modern consciousness.
Of the six surrealistic poems, "Pralay" (The flood) and "Moen-jo-dado: Ek Surreal Akasmaat" are considered the best by several critics. "Pralay" presents a feeling of death or destruction, with the help of situations described in several modes of narration. Sitanshu has used images like the cobra, the moon, pallbearers, pests, a pregnant maiden, flood, famine, fire, a woman and nothingness to arouse the feeling of death or destruction. 
The title poem, "Jatayu", is an experiment in Akhyana, a poetic form of medieval Gujarati literature inspired by the character of Jatayu in the epic "Ramayana". It presents a feeling of the distressful condition of modern man.
Reception.
"Jatayu" was well received by readers and critics. Dhirubhai Thaker acclaimed the poems for their technique of sound of words, symbols and surreal diction. He further added that in some poems like "Haa" and "Ghero", which however are fine pieces of imagery, the language loses its sharpness due to the long and unclear expressions.
The book was selected for the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1987. It had its first edition in 1986, second in 1991, third in 2000, and fourth in 2009. The fourth edition includes an audio CD of poems recited by the poet himself.
Translation.
The books were translated by Chandra Prakash Deval into Rajasthani in 1996. The title poem, "Jatayu", has been translated by Rachel Dwyer into English.

Casa de Sá

Casa de Sá (historically Casa Grande de Sá or alternatively Casa da Lage) is a historic manor house and agricultural estate in the Municipality of Ponte de Lima, Portugal. It is registered as a historic property of public interest by the Portuguese Government’s IGESPAR institute.
In its current form, the principal building dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, and is typical of the Northern Portuguese seigneurial architecture of the period. The estate contains a chapel, consecrated in 1739 and dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, with a large baroque wood-carved retable; an integrally preserved 18th-century winery and granary, and terraced landscape gardens of 19th-century Romantic design.
It was the birthplace of António de Araújo e Azevedo, 1st Count of Barca, one of the foremost Portuguese political figures of his time.
History.
The property and original manor house, of which nothing remains, were in the possession of the Pereira Pinto family since at least 1500. Their ancestors had initially contracted a lease on the land from the abbots of the benedictine monastery of Saint Cosmas in Ázere, Arcos de Valdevez, but eventually came to own it. In 1708, the marriage of heiress Violante Pereira Pinto to jurisconsult Tristão de Araújo de Azevedo brought it into the possession of the Araújo family, formerly Lords of Lobios, who had fled to Minho from Galicia after killing a certain Lopo Soares, majordomo of the Bishop of Ourense. 1711 marked the beginning of the works that were to lend the house its present shape.
 Between then and the Liberal reforms of the early 19th century, the estate was transmitted according to the rules of primogeniture as a majorat.
António de Araújo e Azevedo, prime-minister of Portugal under King John VI and a key figure in the last decades of the colonial history of Brazil, was born in the house in 1754, the eldest of ten siblings. Although he inherited the estate at a young age, his political and diplomatic career would take him to The Hague, St. Petersburg, Paris (where he was briefly incarcerated in the Bastille) and finally Rio de Janeiro, where he accompanied the royal household in the wake of the Napoleonic invasion of Portugal.
His brother Brigadier Francisco António de Araújo e Azevedo, also born in the house in 1772, was a colonial administrator, becoming 7th Captain-General of the Azores in 1816. He is famed for having led the Constitutional Revolt in Angra in the context of the Portuguese Civil War, and was killed in a counter-revolutionary coup on 3-4 April 1821. The 1st Count of Barca having died a bachelor in 1817, the house was inherited by Francisco's descendants.
Through marriage, it passed to the family of the Viscounts of Barrosa, of nearby Viana, in the early 20th century. It is presently in the possession of the Ayres de Campos family, by descent.
The house was renovated between 1909 and 1911. Plans for a new wing designed by architect José Rego Vianna in 1921 were begun but never completed.

Polemarch (1918 – after 1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 1920 when he won the Gimcrack Stakes and the Rous Plate as well as finishing third in the Middle Park Stakes. In the following year he won the Knowsley Dinner Stakes and the Great Northern Leger but appeared to have been exposed as some way short of top class before he recorded a 50/1 upset victory in the St Leger. In 1922 he became increasingly temperamental and difficult to manage and failed to win or place in five starts. He was then sold and exported to Argentina where he had considerable success of a breeding stallion.
Background.
Polemarch was a "leggy" chestnut horse with a white blaze bred and owned by Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry. He was initially sent into training with Captain R H Dewhurst at his Bedford Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Polemarch was an unusually late foal, being born on 3 June 1918.
He was sired by The Tetrarch an unbeaten horse who was regarded as one of the fastest two-year-old ever seen in Britain and Ireland, but whose career was ended by injury before he could race at three. The Tetrarch showed very little interest in his stud duties: his attitude towards sex was described as being "monastic in the extreme". Although he sired few foals his progeny included several major winners. Polemarch's dam Pomace, was a full-sister to the Middle Park Stakes winner Corcyra.
The colt's name, which was an ancient Greek military title, caused some confusion: although the correct pronunciation was "polly-mark", bookmakers and the racing public called him "pole-march".
Racing career.
1920: two-year-old season.
Polemarch ran five times as a two-year-old in 1920. He finished unplaced on his debut at Newmarket in July and first came to attention when finishing second in the Wynyard Plate at Stockton Racecourse in August, beaten ahead by the highly rated filly Barrulet. Later that month Polemarch contested the Gimcrack Stakes over six furlongs in which he was ridden by Fred Lane. Starting at odds of 5/1 he won by a neck from Lemonora with the filly Hasty Match in third. Although Lemonora looked an unlucky loser it was noted that Polemarch was likely to improve as he needed more time to "furnish and thicken" into his "ample frame". He then added a win in the Rous Plate at Doncaster Racecourse in September.
On his final appearance of the season on 15 October at Newmarket Racecourse Polemarch finished third behind Monarch and Humorist in the Middle Park Plate. As the owner of the Gimcrack winner, Lord Londonderry was invited to give the speech at the annual Gimcrack dinner in December in which he said that winning the St Leger was his "life's ambition".
1921: three-year-old season.
For the 1921 season, Polemarch was transferred to the training stable of Tom Green but his early form was disappointing. He finished down the field behind Lord Astor's Craig an Eran in the 2000 Guineas and did not contest the Derby which saw the ill-fated Humorist win from Craig an Eran and Lemonora. Polemarch was instead dropped in class but finished unplaced behind Long Suit in the Royal Standard Stakes at Manchester Racecourse. On 21 July he showed some signs of a return to form when he won the Knowsley Dinner Stakes over ten furlongs at Liverpool. In the following month Polemarch was stepped up in distance for the Great Northern Leger over thirteen furlongs at Stockton and won by a neck from the Irish colt Tremola. On his final start before the St Leger however, the colt was diappointig when beaten by Napolyon in a three-runner race at York.
On 7 September Polemarch, ridden by Joe Childs started a 50/1 outsider in a nine-runner field for the 146th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster. Lord Londonderry was sceptical about his horse's chances, reportedly commenting that Polemarch could "only gallop for six furlongs". The overwhelming favourite for the race at odds of 1/4 was Craig an Eran, while the other runners included Tremola, Lord Glanely's Westward Ho (Great Yorkshire Stakes), Thunderer and Lord Carnarvon's Franklin (Hardwicke Stakes). Polemarch was restrained at the rear of the field as Franklin and Tremola et the pace and was not in the first three entering the straight. Franklin went to the front a furlong out but Polemarch produced a "brilliant finishing run" along the inside rail, took the lead in the closing stages and stayed on well to win "quite comfortably" by one and a half lengths from Franklin, with a gap of three lengths back to Westward Ho in third. Craig An Eran, who failed to stay, finished fourth with Tremola in fifth. Lord Londonderry was reportedly "dumbfounded" by the result.
1922: four-year-old season.
Polemarch remained in training as a four-year-old but made little impact having apparently "acquired an acute distaste for racing". He began his third season at Kempton Park Racecourse and ran unplaced in the Great Jubilee Handicap a race he contested despite his trainer's misgivings. In June he lined up for the Coronation Cup but refused to race and was left at the start. In the Ascot Gold Cup he seemed reluctant to make any real effort and finished unplaced behind Golden Myth. Another poor performance followed in the Manchester Cup when he finished last of the eight runners despite having led the field two furlongs out before dropping back very quickly. He took on Golden Myth again in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park on 21 July but never looked likely to win and came home a distant fourth.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Polemarch a "poor" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
On 1 August 1922 it was announced that Polemarch had been sold to stand as a breeding stallion and he was shipped to Buenos Aires in the following month. During the voyage he became "exceedingly savage", biting several crew members and passengers and causing "general havoc" aboard the ship.
Polemarch had considerable success in Argentina and sired the winners of six Argentinian classics:

Gustav-Adolf Mossa

Gustav-Adolf Mossa (28 January 1883 – 25 May 1971) was a French illustrator, playwright, essayist, curator and late Symbolist painter.
Early life.
Mossa was born 28 January 1883 in Nice, to an Italian mother, Marguerite Alfieri, and , an artist, founding curator of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice (Nice Museum of Fine Arts) and organiser of the Nice Carnival from 1873.
Art and theatre work.
Mossa received his initial artistic training from his father before studying at the School of Decorative Arts in Nice until 1900, where he became acquainted with Art Nouveau and was later introduced to the Symbolist movement after visiting the Exposition Universelle in the same year. Mossa was heavily inspired by the art of Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau and Symbolist writers, such as Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly and Joris-Karl Huysmans.
The main body of Mossa's public and private art work was created with water colours and strong ink lines, the subjects including caricatures, Carnival or medieval scenes, portraits and landscapes, with a fascination for the French Riveria in particular. He also created wooden reliefs, designed theatre scenery, wrote literary essays and created book illustrations, including a large series of drawings for the work of Robert Schumann.
In 1902 he began collaborating with his father on the Nice Carnival project, designing floats and posters. Both father and son are still celebrated for raising the Carnival's prestige, and the event continues to be a major, large scale tourism attraction in Nice.
Symbolist paintings.
Mossa's decade long Symbolist period (1900-1911) was his most prolific and began as a reaction to the recent boom of socialite leisure activity on the French Rivera, his works comically satirising or condemning what was viewed as an increasingly materialistic society and the perceived danger of the emerging New Woman at the turn of the century, whom Mossa appears to consider perverse by nature.
His most common subjects were femme fatale figures, some from Biblical sources, such as modernised versions of Judith, Delilah and Salome, mythological creatures such as Harpies or more contemporary and urban figures, such as his towering and dominant bourgeoise woman in "Woman of Fashion and Jockey". (1906) His 1905 work "Elle", the logo for the 2017 Geschlechterkampf exhibition on representations of gender in art, is an explicit example of Mossa's interpretation of malevolent female sexuality, with a nude giantess sitting atop a pile of bloodied corpses, a fanged cat sitting over her crotch, and wearing an elaborate headress inscribed with the Latin "hoc volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas" (What I want, I order, my will is reason enough).
Many aspects of Mossa's paintings of this period were also indictive of the decadent movement, with his references to Diabolism, depictions of lesbianism (such as his two paintings of Sappho), or an emphasis on violent, sadistic or morbid scenes.
Though these paintings are the subject of most present day exhibitions, scholarly articles and books on the artist, they were not released to the public until after Mossa's death in 1971.
In 1911, Mossa discovered Flemish Primitive and Gothic art while in Brugge and abandoned Symbolism.
Theatre.
Mossa wrote several operas and plays, and contributed to a revival of dialectal theater with his first theatrical piece "Lou Nouvé o sia lou pantai de Barb' Anto" (1922), written in the Niçard dialect. Following the play's success, Mossa established the Lou Teatre de Barba Martin group, who performed his comedies 'Phygaço' (1924), 'La Tina' (1926) and 'Lou Rei Carneval' (1935), until 1940. His plays are still performed in Nice.
Gallery work and later life.
After the death of his father, Alexis, Mossa took over the curation of the Nice Museum of Fine Arts in 1927 and would keep the position until his death in 1971. Mossa would later bequeath most of his own artistic pieces to the gallery.
From the end of the Second World War, Mossa devoted himself to creating works about the City of Nice, illustrating official documents, drawing armorial bearings and traditional suits of the County, and producing several watercolours of the region's landscapes.
Personal life.
In 1908 he married Charlotte-Andrée Naudin, whom he divorced in 1918. He married again in 1925 to Lucrèce Roux, until her death in 1955. He was married a final time in 1956 to Marie-Marcelle Butteli, until his death on 25 May 1971.

All Saints Church, Porthcawl

All Saints Church, Porthcawl is a Listed Anglican church in the seaside resort of Porthcawl, South Wales. It is a daughter church of St John's in Newton, despite being considerably larger in size.
St John's, founded in the 1180s, proved sufficient for many years to handle the numbers of worshippers. Only after Porthcawl acquired a new harbour in the mid 19th Century did the population (and thus number of worshippers) begin to prove beyond the capacity of St John's.
The first All Saints was set up beside the harbour in 1866. This had a dual purpose as a school (the street is still called 'Old School Road'). It was replaced by a large tin tabernacle in 1892 (or 1899), which stood on the site of the present church, which replaced it in 1914. The church's original designs of 1909 envisaged a south-east tower, though this was not built and the gap is now bricked off. The church was later extended to the north-east in the 1960s, when a vestry and lady chapel were added. Listed status was granted in 1992.
The church's east window, installed in 1927, is the work of Karl Parsons.

All Nerve

All Nerve is the fifth full-length studio album by American alternative rock band the Breeders, released on March 2, 2018, 10 years after their previous album "Mountain Battles" (2008). A "Stereogum" article in June 2016 reported that the band was recording new material at their Ohio studio and in October 2017 they released the first single from the album titled "Wait in the Car". 4AD announced on January 9, 2018, that the new album would be made available on March 2, 2018, and released the album's second single, "All Nerve" on the same day. The album also marks the band's first in 25 years with their "Last Splash" lineup. Courtney Barnett guests on one song on the album; "Howl at the Summit".
Background.
In 2012 Kim and Kelly Deal decided to commemorate the upcoming 20-year anniversary of the Breeders' 1993 album "Last Splash" by touring in 2013 with the albums original recording personnel and made contact with Josephine Wiggs and Jim MacPherson. At this time Kim and MacPherson had not spoken since their acrimonious split during their time together in the Amps, however both he and Wiggs were interested and their record label, 4AD decided to release a deluxe 20th anniversary version of the album titled "LSXX". The tour began in the US, continued in Europe, Australia, and South America, and included the Deerhunter-curated All Tomorrow's Parties festival. A teaser video was made by the band showing the reunited lineup in rehearsal. Reflecting on these rehearsals Kim said of the experience "It feels really natural, but at the same time there is adjustment. Like when Jim set up his drums and I started playing with him, I had to turn around and crank my amplifier up like two numbers. He's pretty loud." At the conclusion of the "LSXX" tour the band realized how well they were all getting along and decided to record new music together. During the recording at their Ohio studio Courtney Barnett, who was in town for the Nelsonville Music Festival, recorded some backup vocals for "Howl at the Summit". For the duration of the recording process, Wiggs stayed in Kim Deal's attic at her Dayton, Ohio home to avoid having to drive the 10 hour journey to New York.
Reception.
"All Nerve" was released to universal acclaim, scoring 84 on aggregate website Metacritic, based on 31 reviews. AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares praised the album as "one of the band's finest blends of sugar and swagger, space and noise." "Record Collector"s Alun Hamnett praised Kim Deal's decision to leave the Pixies in 2013 to focus exclusively on the Breeders, stating, "They took their sweet time, but that Breeders line-up is back, and has just nonchalantly knocked it out of the park." "The Guardian"s Alexis Petridis said the album "blends ancient monuments and crushed beetles into a spectral brew". In a slightly more negative review, Julian Marszalek of "The Quietus" criticized the latter half of the album, writing that "the album goes through a variety of fits and starts before descending into anticlimax. 'Skinhead #2' and 'Blues at the Acropolis' are inconclusive filler, which on an album that lasts a little over 30 minutes, just isn’t good enough."
"Mojo" ranked the album number 10 on their list of "Top 75 Albums of 2018" in their end-of-the-year November 2018 issue.

Raoued Operation

The Raoued operation ("") was an anti-terrorist operation that was conducted in February 2014 in Raoued, Tunisia against Salafist extremists.
Operation.
On 3 February 2014, the Tunisian police were informed of the presence of armed jihadists in the city of Raoued, located in the suburbs of Tunis.
More than 150 men from the National Guard were sent in the afternoon to surround a house where Salafist fighters were located, while all the roads leading to the city were blocked. In the following hours and until the following day, several firefights broke out between the jihadists and the National Guards. After being dislodged from one house, the Salafists took refuge in a second. Finally, on 4 February at midday, the National Guards launched an assault that defeated the besieged.
Casualties.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, seven terrorists were killed in the fight and another was taken prisoner. A National Guard member was also killed - 29-year-old Atef Jabri and sergeant of the special brigade - and another wounded.
Among the jihadists killed was Kamel Gadhgadhi, a leader of Ansar al-Sharia, suspected of the February 2013 assassination of Chokri Belaid, and a participant in the Battle of Chaambi.
Three other dead were quickly identified: Mohamed Naceur Dridi, Haykel Badr, and Alaeddine Najahi. In addition to Kamel Gadhgadhi, among the dead would be two other people - Alaeddine Ben Abdelwaheb Njahi said "Abu Haydar" and Ali Ben Mustapha Ben Saad Kala - who allegedly took part in the mutilation of Tunisian soldiers killed during the Battle of Chaambi.

Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar

Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar (Persian: ساسان بھنام بختیار) is an Iranian-French multidisciplinary artist who lives in the south of France. Behnam-Bakhtiar is primarily known for his oil paintings created in his signature style of peinture raclée, collage works and films.
Early life and education.
Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar was born in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1984, during the middle of the Iran–Iraq War. Through his mother, Firouzeh Bakhtiar-Bakhtiariha, he traces his descent from Iran's ancient Bakhtiari tribe. His great-grandfather General Gholam-Hossein Khan Bakhtiar (Sardar Mohtashem), was Iran's Minister of War, while his grandfather Abdolhamid Bakhtiar was a Majles deputy. Many of his other relatives, such as the late Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar and General Teymour Bakhtiar (two of his great-uncles), as well as the second wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Queen Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari, to name a few, were also notable figures in the Pahlavi and Qajar eras. Through his father, he is a descendant of the Qajar monarch Ahmad Shah.
Although born in Paris, Behnam-Bakhtiar spent his formative years in Tehran, and, at the age of nineteen, moved to nearby Dubai to study at the American University in Dubai (AUD). Later on, with his wife, Maria Zakharchenko, he relocated to Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat in France continuing his studies at the nearby Principality of Monaco to obtain his MBA at the International University of Monaco.
Career.
Behnam-Bakhtiar's early works—mostly paintings—were largely informed by Iranian icons and imagery, and were first shown at Magic of Persia's auction in Dubai in 2009. Shortly afterwards, he produced two series regarding the Iran-Iraq War (A Reason to Fight and Aftermath), as well as the autobiographical "The Real Me", which brought to the fore various aspects of his identity and scenes of historical Iran. In "The Real Me" Behnam-Bakhtiar developed his signature style of pairing black-and-white photography with vibrant collage cut-outs adorned with traditional Iranian patterns and motifs.
His works have been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in London, New York, Los Angeles, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Tehran. They have also been widely sold by the auction houses Bonhams, Christie's, and artnet.
Behnam-Bakhtiar's oil more recent and most recognised works are paintings created in his signature style of peinture raclée involving and intricate style of scraping, relaying and spreading of numerous blends over particular points. For the artist, these, represent layers of energy, feelings and time. He paints from one layer to another for several months to years to create his complex works referencing to a prosperous way of life, human evolution, the universal language, eternal feelings and Self, history, present and future, awakening a strong sense of experiencing positive emotions and transcendence, while accessing its audience's psyche to bring about locked knowledge, intuition and human sensitivity.
Behnam-Bakhtiar's paintings have been exhibited since 2017 alongside works by Gerhard Richter, Georg Baselitz and Sigmar Polke amongst others, including a solo exhibition at London's Saatchi Gallery and a solo exhibition at the historic Villa Santo Sospir in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat entitled Oneness Wholeness with Jean Cocteau.
In 2016, the Behnam-Bakhtiar family founded the Fondation Behnam-Bakhtiar in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, a collection of contemporary works by artists of Iranian descent. It houses pieces by artists including Parviz Tanavoli, Shirin Neshat, Farideh Lashai, Sohrab Sepehri, and Ardeshir Mohassess, as well as lesser-known ones. The non-political and non-religious Fondation is intended as a cultural gateway between Iran and the West.
Philanthropy.
Through the Behnam-Bakhtiar Award, the Fondation works to support emerging artists of Iranian descent through financial support, as well as in the hosting of exhibitions and in printing of artists' books. The award was first held in 2017 in the theme ‘Future. Iran.’ with works on the development of a better future for Iran. Iran-based artist Babak Kazemi won first prize. Behnam-Bakhtiar is also a patron of the Serpentine Galleries and has been patron of the Magic of Persia charity in London, assisting at its fundraising galas.
Reception.
Behnam-Bakhtiar's art has gained recognition from several publications, notably "The Guardian", "Tatler", "Vanity Fair""Harper's Bazaar Art" "GQ". and "Huffington Post".

Weymouth Old Town Hall

Weymouth Old Town Hall is a former town hall at Weymouth, Dorset, England. The building, which was built with Portland stone in the 1770s, has been Grade II listed since 1953. The bell turret is believed to date from the 17th century. Since 2009, the hall has been operated for community use by the Guardians of the Old Town Hall.
History.
The Old Town Hall has Tudor origins, with the same site being the location of an earlier town hall since the 16th century. Traditionally Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, until the two towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571. However, both continued to use their separate town halls, with Weymouth's being rebuilt around 1774. By the 1890s, the town hall was in need of repair, and a major restoration and alteration project was carried out in 1896 for a cost of £877. The clock above the main door of the building was presented by Sir Henry Edwards upon completion of the work. By this time, the Weymouth Guildhall, which had opened in 1838 on the site of the former Melcombe Regis Town Hall, was now the council's main place for meetings.
The hall, still under the council's ownership, was later used as the headquarters of the local Girl Guides from the mid-20th century onwards. The hall became vacant in 2005 and fell into a state of disrepair. Although the council had initially planned to lease the building, the extensive repair work discouraged potential tenants, including the Citizens Advice Bureau who had considered moving into the building. The council attempted to sell the hall in 2007, but after a deal fell through, the council gave the Chapelhay Community Partnership a 30 year rent-free lease in 2009 to transform the building into an arts and heritage centre. The Guardians of the Old Town Hall formed that year as a community interest company to manage and operate the building.
The hall quickly became a regular host of various events and exhibitions, while planned restoration work received planning approval in 2011. The old town hall bell, which had been removed for repairs in the 1970s, was returned in February 2011. Further restoration was undertaken in 2015, funded by McCarthy &amp; Stone, who then temporarily used the building as a sales office for their nearby Harbour Lights Court development. The work received the Weymouth Civic Society Award for 2015.

<doc id="56640482" url="?curid=56640482" title="Roller Milled White Enriched Flour">
Roller Milled White Enriched Flour

The Roller Mill was created by Hungarian bakers in the late 1860's and it's popularity spread world wide throughout the 1900s. Roller mills now produce almost all non-whole grain flour. Enriched flour is flour that meets an FDA standard in the United States. Roller milled white enriched flour makes up over 90% of the flour that comes out of the United States. 
The significance of the roller mill that produces white flour.
In 2017, well over 90% of the United States commercial flour production was not whole grain. Virtually all of this non-whole grain flour was produced on flour roller mills. These unique mills were first developed in Europe in the 1860s, soon after were patented and introduced into the United States and quickly came to dominate the world's flour milling industry as they continue to do today.
Flour roller mills were specifically designed to efficiently separate the bran and germ elements of the wheat kernel. What remains is the endosperm, generally referred to as white flour. White flour is often artificially enriched to restore some of the nutrition lost by separating out the bran and the germ elements. In the U.S., white flour is nearly always artificially enriched to restore some of the nutrition lost by removing the bran and germ elements. Enrichment rules vary among countries.
Overview of the wheat kernel.
Wheat and other grains grow on a stalk and have an outer covering known as the husk, or the hull, which is not nutritional to humans. When the hull is removed, it is often referred to as chaff. The edible part of the wheat kernel is a wheat berry composed of the bran (about 14% of the kernel volume), the germ (about 3% of the kernel volume), and the endosperm (about 83% of the kernel volume).
The wheat berries' outer protective shell is the bran. The bran is rich in dietary fiber and fatty acids, and contains significant quantities of starch, protein, vitamins, and minerals. The germ is a source of several nutrients, including vitamin E, folate, phosphorus, thiamin, zinc, and magnesium, as well as fatty acids and fatty alcohols. The germ is also a source of fiber. The endosperm's natural purpose (like all fruits) is to give nutrition to the germ in the form of starch when the seed is planted in the soil and sprouts into a plant. It also contains some oils and protein.
Background of the Invention.
In early America, flour mills used mill stones that were set close together and turned at high speed, crushing all the components of the wheat kernel into an indiscriminate flour. This was generally referred to as low milling. At the time, without refrigeration or sealed storage, the heightened water absorption properties of the crushed bran fiber and the oil-rich germ shortened the shelf life of this flour. It was also more attractive to insects and vermin. Sifting or bolting, could separate some of the elements, because the thicker bran seed coat of the soft winter wheat varieties would crack into relatively large fragments. In this era, the limited amount of endosperm that could be sifted into a whiter flour was understandably preferred by consumers.
Stone milled soft white wheat, which is lower in protein, dominated United States production before the introduction of Red Fife hard red spring wheat in the 1860s and Turkey hard red winter wheat in the 1870s. The higher gluten and protein properties of these hard wheats offered better bread-making qualities than the soft wheat varieties. U.S.commercial millers initially significantly discounted the hard wheats because the white endosperm that customers preferred could be more easily sifted from the soft wheats.
However, millers worldwide began to experiment with high grinding, or placing the mill stones further apart and turning them at slower speeds. The process was to first crack the wheat kernel and then to extract the flour by a succession of grindings and siftings. The white endosperm flour yield was enhanced by the addition of device known as the middlings purifier, which sent a blast of air into the mixture of partially-ground kernels as they were being sifted, lifting the bran particles upward into a separate holding area. A patent was granted to George Christian for this device, and the consistent output of high quality flour thus became known as patent flour. However, the use of mill stones in this high grinding process soon proved not to be optimum.
The invention of the roller mill.
The improved functionality of baked products made with a finer flour mixture first got international attention at the 1867 Paris International Exposition. The Hungarian baking exhibitors clearly out performed their French counterparts. They credited the finer flour that Hungarian millers were able to produce by using more uniform steel rollers instead of mill stones for their higher quality baked goods. The notoriety of their flour was the motivation for staging the 1873 Vienna International Exhibition held to promote the merits of this new technology. A patent employing the use of grooved steel rollers geared to mill at different speeds was later granted in the U.S.in 1880. The obvious efficiency of the roller mill prompted adoption over the next decade and came to dominate the commercial flour industry. No all-millstone mills of any significance were built in the U.S. after that with the commercial flour grindstone virtually disappearing from the flour milling scene in all developed countries by the early 1900s.
To enhance output, millers experimented with flour tempering, or hydrating the outer shell of the wheat berry, which facilitates the elimination of the bran and the germ. This is now a key step in the roller milling production of white endosperm flour. In contrast, whole grain milling systems that process the entire wheat kernel in one pass keep the grain as dry as possible. In 2017, these "single stream" systems actually produced a modest amount of the whole grain flour that was commercially milled. Most of the commercial whole grain flour produced is reconstituted or recombined after first being separated by roller mills .
Flour enrichment.
In the 1930s and 1940s, specific deficiency disease syndromes were first identified and documented in the United States. In order to improve the nutritional status of the population, in 1941 the FDA established a standard of identity for any flour labeled as enriched. These standards have been amended over the years, but they continue as the basis for the addition of thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, folic acid, and iron, with the addition of calcium as optional. Under this regulation, fortification of flour and bread products is not mandatory, but if a product is labeled as enriched, it must meet the standards of identity described in the FDA regulations. The National Labeling Education Act of 1990 provided for federal preemption of standards of identity, nullifying any state laws that made enrichment of flour and bread products mandatory.

Public housing in Brunei

Public housing in Brunei comprises government development programmes which aim to provide ownership of land or homes to the citizens of Brunei. They are managed by the Housing Development Department (), a government department under the Ministry of Development. There has been three main public housing programmes in the country, namely the National Housing Scheme (), the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme () and the National Resettlement Scheme ().
History.
Public housing was first initiated in the 1950s by the government in the form of mass resettlement programmes for the residents of Kampong Ayer, the stilt settlement on the Brunei River. In that decade there were cholera and smallpox epidemics which greatly affected the residents; at that time more residents settled along the banks than the middle of the river and hence more prone to the diseases. Therefore, the initial aim of the housing programme was to relocate the residents to places on land which are less susceptible to the spread of the diseases.
However, the programme eventually shifted its aim to allow the Kampong Ayer residents in owning a home on land. The first resettlement programme was carried out in 1952 in which a housing estate was developed in Bunut. There were then succession of resettlement programmes in the following few decades, and subsequently various resettlement estates appeared which are all located in Brunei-Muara District.
In the 1970s, the government conducted analysis on the housing demands in the country and eventually came up with the present housing programmes. Lambak Kanan became the first area to be developed as the estate of beginning in 1984.
Programmes.
Although there has been three main housing development programmes conducted by the government, only two are currently pursued, namely the National Housing Scheme and the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme.
National Housing Scheme.
The National Housing Scheme (, commonly abbreviated as "RPN") aims to provide homes to the citizens of Brunei regardless of ethnic or racial background. Houses are granted in turns according to the year of the application by the applicants.
Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme.
In contrast with the National Housing Scheme, the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (, commonly abbreviated as "STKRJ") aims to provide private lands, which often comes with completely-built homes, specifically to or the indigenous citizens of the country. The are essentially the indigenous Malays, which consist of the seven ethnic groups officially recognised by the government, namely the Brunei Malay, Kedayan, Bisaya, Tutong, Dusun, Belait and Murut.
National Resettlement Scheme.
The National Resettlement Scheme () has been a housing programme carried out by the government to aid the residents of Kampong Ayer in resettling on land. It is currently not active or that the relocation programme is handled as part of the other two housing programmes.
Estates.
The housing estates are developed in all four districts of Brunei, generally as part of existing villages or other survey areas, or in their vicinity. Each estate constitutes only one of either housing programmes. However, a village or area may have more than one type of estates. Some estates may also have enough population comparable that of village settlements and hence they are designated as village subdivisions, the third- and lowest-level administrative divisions of the country. A few estates even have larger population and end up having more than one village subdivisions. 
Nevertheless, each village subdivision of a housing estate functions similar to the local village, including having a or village head as its community leader as well as a Village Consultative Council () as the community association. There may also be presence of community infrastructure such as a primary school and a community centre. As Brunei is predominantly Muslim, a mosque may also be built for the Muslim residents to perform Jumu'ah or Friday prayers, as well as a religious school which provides the Islamic religious primary education compulsory for Muslim pupils in the country.

"Sepia orbignyana" is a fairly small cuttlefish, growing up to 12 cm in total length. with the females generally being larger than males, male mantle length up to 84mm and females' up to 120mm. It has a slim, oval body and relatively long arms, each having four rows of suckers. There is an obvious lobe of the dorsal mantle which projects between the eyes and there is a prominent tip at the posterior end of the mantle, which lies in the gap between the posterior ends of the fins. The tentacular club is short and has its suckers arranged in five–six rows, with the middle series having three to four greatly enlarged suckers. The hectocotylus is found on the left ventral arm and has one or two rows of suckers of normal size at the base, highly reduced suckers in the mid part and then normal size suckers towards the tip. The suckers on the hectocotylus are arranged in two dorsal and two ventral series each of which are laterally displaced to create a gap between them. Females have a single spermathecae situated medially on the ventral part of the buccal membrane. It is often coloured rose or orange on the dorsal surface which has a faint ridge.
The cuttlebone is long and thinly oblong in shape with a long posterior spine. having a width equal to one third of its length. and distinct lateral wings.
This species is largely sympatric with "Sepia elegans", another relatively small species of cuttlefish but "S. orbignyana" can be identified from "S. elegans" by the fins almost reaching the very rear of the, and on having a higher number of suckers, over 100, on each tentacular club. The juveniles resemble tiny adults.
Distribution.
"Sepia orbignyana" occurs over a wide geographic distribution which extends from the Irish Sea, as far north as southwestern Scotland and English Channel south along the Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Portugal and into the Mediterranean Sea, where it is found throughout the sea, and south along the west coast of Africa as far as Angola. Off northwest Africa it is also found around the Sahara Seamounts. It is most abundant in the Sicilian Channel.
Habitat and ecology.
"Sepia orbignyana" is a demersal species that occurs at depths of 50m to 450m over detritus-rich or muddy substrates on the continental shelf or continental slope. It is often found in sympatry with "S. elegans" and "S. officinalis" but it seems to prefer to inhabit deeper parts of the sea than "S. officinalis", and unlike that species it does not bury itself in the substrate. In the Sea of Marmara it can be found in brackish water. In the Mediterranean spawning probably occurs continuously and adults of both sexes are present in similar numbers throughout the year, although breeding activity is thought to peak in the warmer months. In the Atlantic adults predominate in the spring off Portugal. There are no records of movements towards the coasts to spawn. Females grow faster than males and reach larger sizes In the Mediterranean males attain maturity at around 35mm in mantle length and at age 6–7 months while for females maturity is reached at a mantle length of 65mm and at the age of nine to ten months. The males have about 100 spermatophores and the females bear around 400 eggs. As the female increases in size so doe the diameter of the eggs she carries, reaching a maximum diameter of 7 to 8.5 mm. The eggs are laid in clusters of 30 to 40 which adhere to sponges growing on muddy bottoms. The diet of "S. orbignyana" is predominantly made up of crustaceans, with fish and cephalopods making up a minor part of the diet.
Fisheries.
"Sepia orbignyana" sometimes caught in high numbers as bycatch in trawls in parts of the Mediterranean Sea and in west African fisheries. It is also a quarry species in targeted fisheries such as in the Sicilian Channel. The catch is sold in local markets in either frozen or fresh form. In the south-western Adriatic multi-species trawl fishery it, together with "S. elegans", is taken as bycatch and in the 2000s the catch greatly reduced, the reduction being blamed on overfishing.
Naming.
The specific name of "Sepia orbignyana" honours the French malacologist Alcide d'Orbigny. being the editor of the "Annales des Sciences Naturelles" at the time André Étienne d'Audebert de Férussac published his described the species, in 1826, from a type specimen collected at La Rochelle. The type is held at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris.

Peter Okpaleke

Peter Ebere Okpaleke (born 1 March 1963) is a Nigerian prelate of the Catholic Church who has been Bishop of Ekwulobia since 29 April 2020. He was appointed Bishop of Ahiara in 2012 and consecrated a bishop in 2013, but he was never installed there because local clergy objected that his appointment did not follow due process for the appointment of bishop of the diocese.
Life.
Priesthood.
Peter Ebere Okpaleke born on 1 March 1963 in Amesi in Anambra State, Nigeria. He attended local schools and in 1983 entered the Bigard Memorial Major Seminary in Ikot-Ekpene and Enugu, where he studied philosophy and theology from 1983 to 1992. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Awka on 22 August 1990.
In the twenty years following his ordination he filled a wide variety of pastoral and administrative positions, including university chaplain, parish priest, diocesan finance administrator, diocesan chancellor, and secretary and member of diocesan boards. He also studied canon law in Rome at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross.
Episcopacy.
On 7 December 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Okpaleke Bishop of Ahiara, Nigeria. Okpaleke was consecrated a bishop on 21 May 2013. Because of objections to his appointment, his consecration was held outside the Diocese, in the Major Seminary of Ulakwo in the Archdiocese of Owerri.
Local clergy and parishioners objected to his appointment and prevented him from entering the cathedral in order to take possession of the diocese. A petition objecting to the fact that Okpaleke was not of the area's Mbaise ethnic origin was sent to Pope Benedict after he appointed Okpaleke Bishop On 9 June 2017, Pope Francis gave clergy in the Diocese 30 days to either write a letter promising obedience and accepting Okpaleke as their bishop or be suspended. Clergy sent letters of apology but continued to protest Okpaleke's as racial discrimination.
On 19 February 2018, Pope Francis accepted Okpaleke's resignation as Bishop of Ahiara.
On 5 March 2020, just over two years after accepting his resignation as Bishop of Ahiara, Pope Francis appointed Okpaleke the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ekwulobia, a newly created diocese in Anambra State which formerly had its territory under the jurisdiction of Awka Diocese.
Okpaleke was installed as Bishop of Ekwulobia on 29 April 2020.

FAM71E1

FAM71E1, also known as Family With Sequence Similarity 71 Member E1, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FAM71E1 gene. It is thought to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels throughout the body, and it is conserved in vertebrates, particularly mammals and some reptiles. The protein is localized to the nucleus and can be exported to the cytoplasm.
Gene.
Location.
The gene is located on the minus strand at 19q13.33 and spans from 50,466,643 to 50,476,753. It is 10,070 bp long.
Gene Neighbohood.
In humans, the gene is flanked by the following genes:
Promoter.
The promoter of FAM71E1 is located on the minus strand from 50,476,094 to 50,477,946 . It is 1,853 bp long.
Expression.
The gene seems to be ubiquitously expressed at low levels throughout the body but has prominent expression in the adult human testis, followed by lower expression levels in the sperm, oocyte, and brain. Age does not have an effect on its expression in the skeletal muscle of males or females. Its expression is elevated prior to the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into pancreatic islet-like cells.
Transcript.
Isoforms.
The FAM71E1 gene produces two isoforms from alternative splicing. Isoform 1 is 1281 bp long, and isoform 2 is slightly shorter at 1233 bp long. Both transcript variants have 5 exons, 4 of which are coding exons. The third intron for the isoform 2 transcript is longer than the one found in isoform 1.
Regulation.
The FAM71E1 transcript is regulated by micro-RNAs, such as miR-149, miR-7, miR-125b, miR-125a-5p, miR192-5p, and miR-215.
Protein.
Properties.
The protein from isoform 1 is 247 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 27.6 kDa. It has a charge of 5.0 and an isoelectric point of 8.9. It has a domain of unknown function (DUF3699), which is conserved in eukaryotes and has no known pairwise interactions with other domains. The structure of the protein has 3 alpha helices and 5 beta strands.
Localization.
The protein is predicted to localize to the nucleus and thought to be mainly associated with the nucleoli fibrillar center. It can also be exported to the cytoplasm.
Homologs.
Paralogs.
The FAM71E1 gene is fast evolving. It has the following 8 paralogs: FAM71A, FAM71B, FAM71C, FAM71D, FAM71E2, FAM71F1, FAM71F2, and AC020922.1. FAM71D, FAM71E2 and AC0209221.1 are found in Amniotes and their last common ancestor with FAM71E1 was likely in the ancestor of the Sauria taxon, which includes reptiles and birds. The remaining paralogs are found in mammals and are expressed in organisms from the evolutionary descendants of the lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii). Their last common ancestor with FAM71E1 was Coelacanth ("Latimeria chalumnae"). 
Orthologs.
Orthologs of FAM71E1 can be found only in vertebrates, primarily in placental mammals in the Boreoeutheria group and occasionally in a few reptilian species. Reptiles and marsupials are included in the distant homologs, while orthologs in placental animals such as rodents and primates are more closely related to FAM71E1. The gene history contains 27 duplication events and 1 splitting event. 
Clinical Significance.
Mutations.
There are no disease-causing mutations associated with this gene, and it is tolerant towards loss-of-function variants.
Disease Associations.
FAM71E1 has reduced expression in Type 2 diabetes patients and is likely not involved in the disease's pathophysiology. Its expression is also altered in Parkinson's disease and several cancers, such as non-triple negative ductal carcinoma in situ, breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. It is a gene of interest in predicting susceptibility to pneumonia.

Dionisio Nencioni di Bartolomeo

Dionisio Nencioni di Bartolomeo (1559, Florence - 1638, Naples) was an Italian architect, mainly active in Naples, to which he moved in 1584. He worked on the Hieronymite church from 1587 until his death, in collaboration with Giovanni Antonio Dosio.
In 1607 he took part in the competition to design the Royal Chapel of the Treasure of St. Januarius, alongside other architects working in Naples such as Francesco Grimaldi, Giovan Battista Cavagna, Giulio Cesare Fontana, Michelangelo Naccherino, Giovan Giacomo Di Conforto, Giovanni Cola di Franco and Ceccardo Bernucci, but his design did not win. In 1612 he worked on the Gesù e Maria Complex and from 1604 to 1632 as one of the architects of San Giuseppe dei Ruffi. In 1631 he made some assessments of the work already done at certosa di San Martino. He spent his final years finishing working on the Gerolamini church (even joining the Hieronymites himself in 1637), which was only completed in 1639.

Kisan Faguji Bansod

Kisan Faguji Bansod (, 1879–1946) was a leader of Dalit movement in pre-independence India.
Bansod was born on 18 February 1879 in a Mahar family at Mohapa village near Nagpur. Influenced by the Bhakti cult, he was a proponent of upliftment of dalits within the fold of Hinduism. He was an advocate of education for dalit boys and girls. Therefore, he established one Chokhamela girls' school at Nagpur. He was also aware of importance of the press to create awareness among the dalit community. He started his own press in 1910 and published the journals "Nirashrit Hind Nagarik", "Vital Vidhwansak", "Majur Patrika", and "Chokhamela". He was one of the secretaries of All India Depressed Classes Conference held at Nagpur in 1920.
Bansod was influenced by the works of Brahmo Samaj and Prarthana Samaj. He attended the annual function of Prarthana Samaj in 1905 at Mumbai. He was also associated with Vitthal Ramji Shinde, founder of Depressed Classes Mission. Though he was a supporter of theory of Aryan conquest and enslavement of dalits, contrary to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, he was in favour of reforms in Hinduism rather than conversion out of it.
He died on 10 October 1946 at Nagpur.

Philippe Ciais

Philippe Ciais is a researcher of the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE), the climate change research unit of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL). He is a physicist working on the global carbon cycle of planet Earth, climate change, ecology and geosciences.
Professional career.
Philippe Ciais studied Physics at École normale supérieure and received a PhD in 1991 entitled “Holocene climate record of Antarctic ice cores”. 
In 1992 he was a post-doctoral fellow at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, Colorado, U.S. and investigated how carbon and oxygen isotopes in atmospheric CO2 can be used to constrain terrestrial carbon fluxes. He also designed the first three-dimensional simulation model of the heavy oxygen isotope in CO2, an isotopic tracer of the water cycle coupled with carbon dioxide uptake by plant photosynthesis.
After 1994, Philippe Ciais returned to France at LSCE and carried out research into the inverse modeling of CO2 and CH4 fluxes at the surface of the Earth, based on transport models and a global network of surface in-situ stations. Under his leadership, this activity has been developed at LSCE into a research team. In parallel, Philippe Ciais led the establishment of the French greenhouse gas atmospheric monitoring network, going from two stations in 1992 to 25 stations today, and became a key component of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) large-scale European research infrastructure.
Philippe Ciais continued research during the last twenty years, mainly on the relationships between ecosystem CO2 fluxes and climate, combining terrestrial biosphere models with satellite and eddy-covariance observations. He took part in the set up and interpretation of one of the first coupled carbon-climate simulation with the IPSL climate model, and pioneered the incorporation of cultivated ecosystems into a terrestrial biosphere model.
Philippe Ciais has been scientific coordinator or principal investigator of French, European Union and International projects and became co-chair of the Global Carbon Project in 2009. He had the opportunity to contribute to several synthesis of recent trends in the carbon cycle, characterized by the recent fast growth of emissions and by a slowing trend of natural sinks, a finding that had a large impact in the media. 
He acted as co-chair of the Global Carbon Observation Strategy of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) task force on integrated carbon observations. 
He has worked for the IPCC in the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report, which was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prizee, and coordinated the Chapter 6 "Carbon and other biogeochemical cycles" in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.
He is one of the principal investigators of the ERC-Synergy 2014-2019 grant IMBALANCE-P project, dealing with phosphorus and nitrogen imbalance of organisms, ecosystems and the earth system.
A collaboration with Beijing University has been maintained with the SINO-FRENCH SOFIE Research Institute for Earth System Science led by Shilong Piao and Philippe Ciais.
Publications.
Philippe Ciais is a highly cited researcher in two fields: Geosciences and Environment/Ecology and in all the fields of the ISI science indicators (Thomson Reuters). He has ranked as the most productive scientific author in the field of climate change, and among the authors who contributed to 5 of the 100 most influential papers in this field in a recent CarbonBrief analysis (2015) and was ranked among the list of Highly Cited Researchers in Clarivate Analytics. 
He has published more than 650 scientific papers and contributed to the dissemination of science activities at national and international level including:

Ambraser Heldenbuch

The Ambraser Heldenbuch ("The Ambras Castle Book of Heroes") is a 16th-century manuscript written in Early New High German, now held in the Austrian National Library (signature Cod. ser. nova 2663). It contains a collection of 25 Middle High German courtly and heroic narratives along with some shorter works, all dating from the 12th and 13th centuries. For many of the texts it is the sole surviving source, which makes the manuscript highly significant for the history of German literature. The manuscript also attests to an enduring taste for the poetry of the MHG classical period among the upper classes.
History.
The manuscript was commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian I and written by Hans Ried in Bolzano over a period of years from 1504 to 1516. It was originally kept in the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle, near Innsbruck, but in 1806, because of the uncertainty of the Napoleonic Wars, the Austrian Emperor Francis I had it moved to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. After the First World War it was transferred to the Vienna Hof-Bibliothek ("Court Library"), which in 1920 became the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek ("Austrian National Library").
Description.
The texts are written on 238 folios of parchment — 476 pages, each 460 x 360 mm in size, each folio numbered with Roman numerals in the top right-hand corner of the recto page.
Before the texts are four folios containing a list of contents and a separate sheet with a full-page illustration on the verso page showing two armed men beneath the arms of Tirol. These five additional sheets were added after the texts were completed and have been numbered I*–V*. The table of contents provides cross-references to the folio numbers in the main body of the manuscript.
The works (all are verse) are set out as prose in a three-column layout, with a punctus (•) to mark the end of a line of verse, or, in many cases, a colon marking the end of a rhyming couplet. Decorated initial letters mark the start of a work or chapter of a work. Lombardic capitals, alternating red and blue, indicate the start of a new strophe or section.
Many pages have illustrations on the outer and bottom margins. The right-hand margin of folio 215r shows a naked woman playing a fiddle beside a shield with the date 1517 and the initials "VF", which are assumed to be those of the artist, variously identified as Ulrich Funk or Valentin/Veit Fiedler.
Contents.
The works in the manuscript are grouped by genre: courtly narratives (including all of Hartmann von Aue's secular narratives), heroic epics (including the Dietrich and Nibelungen legends), and shorter narratives of a mainly didactic nature. The two final works, fragments of Wolfram von Eschenbach's "Titurel" and a German translation of the Latin "Epistola presbiteri Johannis" fall outside this scheme.
The list of works below follows the order in the manuscript, giving the modern titles. (The headings in the manuscript are descriptions of the work and do not match modern titles or indicate authorship.)
Language.
The language of the manuscript is Early New High German with some Bavarian features. Thornton characterises Ried's language as "Tirolean written dialect of the age of Luther". It is consistent with the language of the Habsburg Imperial Chancery, though there are some idiosyncratic spellings.
In spite of the fact that Reid's texts must have come from a variety of sources, his orthography is relatively consistent between the individual works: variations between texts are minor, more likely reflecting gradual changes in his own orthography as the project progressed. This indicates that he must have made a conscious attempt to harmonise the spellings he found in his sources.
Editions.
There is no complete edition of the Ambraser Heldenbuch, though the University of Innsbruck has an ongoing transcription project. In many editions of the individual texts the language of the 16th century manuscript has been adapted into the idealised classical Middle High German of the 13th century, as established by 19th century editors.
Among the diplomatic editions of the texts are:

The Planetary Missions Program Office was established in late 2014 as part of a series of changes implemented by NASA after the passage of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015, which allocated US$1.438 billion to planetary missions, and the Obama administration's request for the 2016 United States federal budget. The program office is a replacement for the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office, established in 2004, and occupies their former headquarters at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Planetary Missions Program Office took control of the Discovery and New Frontiers program, along with the Europa Mission and NASA contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA)'s "JUICE" mission, in a then-unnamed program outside of Discovery and New Frontiers. In 2017, the program was named the "Solar System Exploration Program", and grew to include NASA's surviving "DART" component of the cancelled "AIDA" mission, after ESA terminated their contribution to the mission in late 2016.
Programs.
Discovery.
The Discovery program was established in late 1990 as a program of low-cost, limited-scope solar system exploration missions, succeeding the objectives of the Planetary Observer program. In the late 1980s, leaders at NASA opted towards expensive, more ambitious missions to advance their objectives. This included the Space Exploration Initiative by the George H. W. Bush administration, which laid out a plan to construct Space Station Freedom and establish a human exploration program to the Moon and Mars. Consistent cost overruns and lack of support from the United States Congress, however, created a trend towards smaller, less ambitious missions. NASA's Solar System Exploration Division (SSED) initially proposed to model a new program of small-class unmanned missions after the Planetary Observer program, though members were skeptical, due to the budget problems plaguing the Planetary Observer program at the time. It was decided instead to base it on the Explorer program, following advice from Explorer administrative staffer Tom Krimigis. Under this model, the program gained support from then-NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, and the program was formally approved by Congress in 1992.
Originally a Planetary Observer program mission, "NEAR Shoemaker" was reassigned to the Discovery program, after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory found that the mission was possible to execute on a budget smaller than originally planned. Its final mission cost would reach US$224 million. "Mars Pathfinder" was also reassigned to the program as part of cuts to the Space Exploration Initiative Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) program, following the loss of its flagship "Mars Observer". Both "NEAR Shoemaker" and "Mars Pathfinder" were successfully launched in February and December 1996 respectively; the former achieved orbit around the asteroid 433 Eros in February 2000, and the latter landed on Mars and delivered the first operational Mars rover, "Sojourner", to the surface of the planet in July 1997. After "NEAR Shoemaker" and "Mars Pathfinder", the Discovery program began selecting its future missions from proposals from third-party institutions, in competitions named "Announcements of Opportunity" (AOs). Twelve missions have been selected through AOs, with the latest, reconnaissance missions "Lucy" and "Psyche", selected in January 2017 after a three-year long competition. The Discovery program also presides over "Missions of Opportunity" (MOs) to develop instruments for non-NASA missions, such as the ASPERA-3 instrument onboard ESA's "Mars Express" and the M3 instrument aboard ISRO's "Chandrayaan-1". MOs were originally selected in competitions alongside AOs, though have been selected in "Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity Notices" (SALMONs) since 2009. SALMON-3 is currently underway to select NASA's contribution to JAXA's "Martian Moons Exploration" mission.
Missions
New Frontiers.
The New Frontiers program is the successor to the cancelled Outer Planet/Solar Probe (OPSP) program, a project which aimed to launch the "Europa Orbiter" astrobiology mission, the "Pluto Kuiper Express" reconnaissance mission, and the "Solar Orbiter" heliophysics mission. To reduce the growing costs of the OPSP, the "Pluto Kuiper Express" was cancelled in 2000 by then-Science Mission Directorate Edward J. Weiler, who subsequently accepted proposals for a replacement mission and modelled the competition after the Discovery program's AOs. The "New Horizons" mission was chosen to replace "Pluto Kuiper Express" in the OPSP program in November 2001, though the entire program, including the "Europa Orbiter", "New Horizons", and "Solar Probe", was cancelled by Administrator of NASA Sean O'Keefe in February 2002, shortly after his appointment by President George W. Bush. O'Keefe cited a need for a restructuring of NASA and its projects, falling in line with the Bush Administration's wish for NASA to refocus on "research and development, and addressing management shortcomings."
The "New Horizons" team successfully lobbied for the funding and development of their mission, appearing at the top of the National Research Council's Planetary Science Decadal Survey for 2003–2013. Weiler and then-Solar System Exploration Division Director Colleen Hartman established the New Frontiers program in 2003 to help fund and launch "New Horizons" and future proposals from the Decadal Survey. "New Horizons" was launched as the program's first mission on January 20, 2006, and successfully performed the first reconnaissance of Pluto and its moons in July 2015. An extended mission is underway to observe Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), including a flyby of 486958 Arrokoth in January 2019. In the first New Frontiers AO, "Juno", a mission to investigate the interior of Jupiter, was selected over the "MoonRise" lunar sample return mission. "Juno" launched on August 5, 2011, and arrived at Jupiter in July 2016. In May 2011, the "OSIRIS-REx" asteroid sample return mission was selected over "MoonRise" and "SAGE" for the program's third mission. "OSIRIS-REx" launched on September 8, 2016, and will arrive at the Near-Earth object (NEO) 101955 Bennu in August 2018. The program's fourth mission is "Dragonfly", which will launch in 2026 and arrive on Titan in 2034.
Missions
Solar System Exploration.
In late 2014, the Solar System Exploration program was established alongside the Planetary Missions Program Office to "execute prioritized planetary science." The first planned mission of the program is "DART", an asteroid deflection test targeting 65803 Didymos scheduled to launch in 2020 or 2021. Originally a component of "AIDA", "DART"s impact was intended to be observed by ESA's "AIM" orbiter, which would continue to study Didymos from orbit. However, the ESA Council at ministerial level cancelled the "AIM" mission in favour of funding for the "ExoMars 2020" rover, citing budget concerns. Despite the cancellation of "AIM", NASA committed to their original plan, opting to continue solely with "DART". Two Europa astrobiology missions are scheduled in the Solar System Exploration program. The "Europa Clipper" is scheduled to launch in the early 2020s on the inaugural cargo flight of the Space Launch System. The ESA "JUICE" mission to study Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto will utilize the NASA-built, Solar System Exploration Program-funded Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) and parts of the Particle Environment Package (PEP) and Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME) instruments.

Gesù e Maria Complex

Gesù e Maria Complex was a small monastic complex in Naples which also included the monastic church. The monastery buildings now house a hospital. It is sited on the summit of the zona di Pontecorvo. It was first built for the Dominican friar Silvio d'Atripalda in 1580 - he had obtained its site from Ascanio Coppola. In 1585 the complex was remodelled and extended in the Baroque style by Domenico Fontana - it is one of his earliest works. The Dominicans were expelled in 1812 and their lands and buildings confiscated by the French occupiers. It had passed to another order by 1863, when the monastic buildings were again secularised and turned into a hospital but the church retained as a parish church. It was already in a state of decay by the end of the 19th century and so in 1979 the church was closed, after which it was hit by thefts, the 1980 earthquake and looting. The hospital had been demolished in the meantime. The church was briefly opened for a month in 2012 but it has not yet been fully restored and its future is uncertain.

Callum &quot;Halfway&quot; Highway

Callum "Halfway" Highway is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Tony Clay. He was introduced in the episode first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2018. Halfway is introduced as a friend of the Carter family, which was not publicised beforehand. Halfway is a comedic character who is jovial, dopey and "happy-go-lucky" who wears shabby clothing and beanie hats. Halfway's initial stint on the show focuses on his relationship with the Carter family and establishing a relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty).
The actor was only contracted for two months and Halfway departs in the episode first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2018. Afterwards, Clay was invited back to reprise his role and Halfway returns two months later after serving in the army. His experience in the army and his relationship with Whitney are explored upon his return. Producers introduced Halfway's brother, Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ); their relationship is initially portrayed as dark, but later becomes supportive. Clay's portrayal of Halfway has received a positive response from critics, with a "Soaplife" columnist describing him as "a welcome ray of sunshine in the bleak world of Albert Square", and Laura-Jayne Tyler of "Inside Soap" opining, "Square chiefs had clearly found a diamond in the rough with actor Tony Clay".
Storylines.
Callum sends Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) a text message saying he is coming to his area. Callum later shoots Mick when he is robbing a van that Callum is in, not realising it was Mick under a mask. However, Callum recognises Mick and tries to help him by accompanying him to his home, The Queen Victoria public house, with his wife, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), and mother, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). It emerges Callum knows Mick and Linda because he was friends with their son, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), as a teenager. The following day, he offers his assistance in The Queen Vic as an apology, although annoys the Carters when he accidentally orders too much alcohol and breaks glasses. Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) sets Callum up to spend time with her adoptive sister, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). Callum offers to buy Whitney food and makes her laugh, so she considers meeting him again. They arrange to meet for a drink in The Queen Vic, and Whitney turns up in casual clothes and wearing no makeup but Callum has prepared for a date, giving her a rose and having candles. He asks if she fancies him and then pulls a ring from his pocket, to which Whitney says she will not marry him but he says he only wants her to be his girlfriend. She turns him down and leaves, and he follows, leaving the ring behind. Mick finds the ring and has it valued at £20,000, telling Callum that he could use the money to buy back The Queen Vic, and Callum agrees, revealing that he found the ring during the robbery. When the ring turns out to be worth £200,000, Callum tells Mick to save his pub as long as there will always be a room for Callum if he needs it.
Whitney is touched when Callum recalls how his grandfather brought him up to treat women with respect. When Callum leaves for army duty, Whitney apologises to him and they share a sweet goodbye. After leaving his bag behind, he returns and passionately kisses Whitney, before leaving again. Callum and Whitney stay in contact via video calls. When Callum returns, he is hiding a wound from his abdomen but later tells Whitney that he was injured by shrapnel in an explosion. He and Whitney have sex for the first time. Callum reveals that he saved a child's life in the explosion and he is hailed a hero by the Carters, who throw him a party, but Callum dislikes the attention. Callum’s brother, Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) arrives and realises Callum is lying about his injury. Callum tells Mick that when he saved the child, his friend lost his legs and the child's mother was killed, but Mick says Callum was not to blame. Mick and Callum later assist Stuart in his work exposing paedophiles. Hoping to prove himself to Stuart, Callum confronts Fred Lewis (Malcolm Freeman), but lets him go when Mick threatens him with violence. When Linda finds out, she warns Mick and Callum that they could get hurt. Regardless, Callum tells Stuart that he wants to confront Fred again; Stuart confronts him instead and posts a video online about it.
After discovering that Stuart attacked Mick's aunt, Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), when they were younger, the Carters reject Stuart and warn Callum to do the same. Stuart manipulates Callum into leaving the Carters and moving into his apartment; Callum tells the Carters that Stuart needs someone to believe him. Whitney visits Callum, who tells her that Tina attacked Stuart. After Whitney visits Stuart, he tells Callum that Whitney tried to kiss him; Callum ends their relationship. When Stuart confesses that he lied, Callum disowns him and leaves. After receiving a silent voicemail from Stuart, Callum panics that he is suicidal; he and Shirley visit Stuart's apartment where she finds a defaced photo of Callum. With Shirley's help, Whitney and Callum reunite. Callum meets Stuart and they argue. Stuart later asks for Callum’s help and he protects Stuart from the Carters, claiming that he is in Dublin, as Stuart burns photos of Callum with the Carters. Stuart is later shot in The Queen Vic by an unknown assailant with Callum and the Carters being interviewed by the police. Shirley argues with Callum when she accuses him of shooting Stuart, which he denies. Stuart admits to Callum that he shot himself, before claiming that Mick shot him; Mick is arrested and Callum and the Carters vow to prove his innocence. Mick is later released, and Stuart is rejected by Callum.
Whitney and Callum panic when she tells him that she may be pregnant. Whitney turns out to not be pregnant, but they decide they would like a baby and they agree to try for one. Callum later tells Whitney they should put the baby on hold and save up to buy an apartment instead. Callum is called up to the army again and his doctor, Dr. Cosslett (Hywel Simons), deems him fit to return. Upset by the result of the assessment, Callum tries to harm himself, which is witnessed by Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden). Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) is impressed with Callum when he gets one of his clients, Mrs. Coombes (Jonna Wake), to upgrade her husband's funeral plan and offers him a job as an undertaker at the funeral parlour. Whitney and Callum also move into the apartment above the parlour.
Callum angrily confronts Ben over selling him a stolen van and it leads to a charged moment between the pair. Ben accuses Callum of being attracted to men as well as women, but he denies it. Ben tells Callum he should not hide who he is and they end up kissing. Still confused about his sexuality, Callum proposes to Whitney, who happily accepts. Callum later contacts his estranged father, Jonno Highway (Richard Graham), and he comes to Walford. Jonno berates Callum for his lifestyle and they fall out. Afterwards, Ben comforts Callum and kisses him, which Stuart witnesses. Stuart confronts Callum about the kiss, so Callum confesses; Stuart then attacks Ben.
The guilt over cheating on Whitney eats away at Callum. Not wanting to begin their life together with a secret hanging over them, Callum confesses to Whitney he cheated on her with Ben. Whitney is devastated, but she still decides to go through with the wedding. However, Whitney changes her mind and jilts Callum at the altar, telling him she loves him too much to let him live a lie. Later, Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) holds the pub hostage, shooting Ben in the process. Callum decides to be open with everyone in his life; he tells Stuart he is gay and is accepted by him. Later at the hospital, Ben awakens and asks Callum on a date, to which he accepts.
Creation and development.
Casting and introduction.
Actor Tony Clay was cast in the role of Callum "Halfway" Highway on a two-month contract. The character's introduction was not publicised in the media and he made his first appearance in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2018. Following his first episode, in which established character Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) is shot by Halfway, it was suggested by Joe Anderton from "Digital Spy" that Mick would know his shooter. When viewers suggested that the shooter could be Mick's son Lee Carter, with the role recast from actor Danny-Boy Hatchard to Clay, David Brown of the "Radio Times" doubted that this would be true. In his second episode, Halfway was confirmed to be the shooter and Lee's friend. Clay agreed with Daniel Kilkelly of "Digital Spy" that it was risky for Halfway to shoot Mick in his first episode.
It was not confirmed whether Halfway would be a regular character. However, executive consultant John Yorke had announced in December 2017 that a new friend for Mick and a new interest for Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) would be introduced in 2018. Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") wondered whether Halfway could be the aforementioned friend of Mick and love interest for Whitney. When asked whether he found joining "EastEnders" "daunting", Clay replied, "Yes and no" and stated that although he found it surreal to work with Steve McFadden, who portrays Phil Mitchell, his nerves settled quickly. Halfway departs in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2018, signalling the conclusion of Clay's contract. Claire Crick of "Digital Spy" pointed out that Halfway was a plot device introduced only to support the Carter family's storylines, especially when Halfway is revealed to be in ownership of an expensive ring, which he lets the Carters sell when they need money to save their home, a plot that Crick thought was "convenient".
Reintroduction.
After the end of his original contract, Clay received a phone call from producers asking him to reprise the role. He thought that because he was invited back, he was "really doing something right", and hoped that he was reintroduced based on a positive first stint. On 28 March 2018, it was announced that Clay would reprise his role as Halfway in spring 2018. Clay said that he looked forward to reprising the role, that Halfway is "such a lovely role to play" and that he wanted to explore the character further. He had already begun filming when his return was publicised.
On 20 April, Sophie Dainty of "Digital Spy" reported that Halfway would return in the episode broadcast on 30 April and teased that he may return with a secret. Further details about his return were released two days later, confirming that he would have a secret. It was reported that Whitney would be overjoyed when Halfway returns but that she would notice that "Halfway's mind seems to be elsewhere". Clay explained that it is evident from his return that something has happened to Halfway, despite his efforts to hide this. He said that Halfway wants to share his secret with Whitney as he is a good person and it "conflicts him a bit". The actor expressed how a main aspect to his character is that he does not like keeping secrets and wants to share everything with Whitney. Also, there is a clear change in Halfway's personality when he returns, which is due to the secret. Clay thought it would be "exciting" for the audience to witness his journey.
In his return episode, it is shown that Halfway has been wounded while in the Army. Johnathon Hughes of the "Radio Times" described Halfway injury as "a large, very painful-looking wound". The following episode sees Halfway reveal to Whitney that he was hit by shrapnel while saving two children, leaving Whitney "taken aback by Halfway's heroism". Dainty ("Digital Spy") wondered whether Halfway was "actually more shaken by his army ordeal than he's letting on". It was reported on 8 May 2018 that Halfway would confess to Mick that he was lying about the incident in the Army. In the episodes that followed, Halfway tells Mick that he caused another soldier to lose his leg when saving the children, but is "surprised and heartened" when Mick is not upset by the news.
Clay told Duncan Lindsay of the "Metro" that Halfway returns to Albert Square, the show's setting, because he views it as a home and opined that "he's ever really had a place to call home, this is where he feels loved by Whitney and I think he feels like this is his family, this is his world now and I think this is what brings him back." On Mick and his wife, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), offering Halfway a room at their home, The Queen Victoria pub, as a thank you for helping them with their financial troubles, Clay explained that Halfway wants to return to The Vic and that after helping the Carters, he feels better about himself. He also noted that the Carters gave Halfway "their word that they would always try to look after him whenever he needed it".
Halfway's return to "EastEnders" and secret was placed at number four in "Digital Spy" "big soap moments you have to see this week". A "Soaplife" journalist thought it was "typical" that he was hiding a secret when he returned. The "Daily Express" ran a poll for readers to vote on what they believed Halfway's secret was: 39% of readers thought that Halfway was "ashamed" of something that happened in the Army; 26% of readers were in the opinion that Halfway had given his kidney to Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) to repay him; 15% of readers believed that Halfway left the Army; 13% were convinced that he had been stabbed; and the remaining 7% of readers thought it was something else. There was a positive reaction to his return on Twitter with fans excited that Halfway and Whitney had been reunited.
Characterisation and appearance.
Halfway's costume consists of "scruffy clothes and woolly headwear", mainly beanie hats, and he has a full fringe, which differs from Clay's appearance. Claire Crick of "Digital Spy" thought that Clay could not "look less like his character if he tried." Clay had his hair cut for the role of Halfway as he thought it would suit his character. Clay described the hairstyle as "mad" and thought people sympathised with the character because of it. He hoped that Whitney would decide to take Halfway for a better haircut.
When Halfway returns to the series, he is 27 years old. Halfway is a comedic character, which Laura Morgan of "Digital Spy" liked as she felt scenes including Halfway were "always funnier [than those without him]". Crick believed that Clay's background in stand up comedy would be resourceful when portraying Halfway. Clay also observed that Halfway is comedic, which he thought was a nice characteristic. He explained that Halfway tries to do good and wants to feel "included", and stated that Halfway is a jovial character. He described Halfway as "happy-go-lucky". Clay felt that although he and Halfway shared similar mannerisms, he was not as "dopey" as his character. Halfway often misinterprets moments with other people and says "things at the wrong time". Clay thought that this was Halfway's biggest flaw, commenting, "He loves to put his foot in it!"
Morgan billed Halfway as "hapless", "adorable" and "caring". She observed that Halfway acts as "a bit of a dope" and in a silly manner, but is actually quite clever. In article about the character, Morgan expressed her hope that writers would not portray Halfway as "a one-dimensional dumbass". Daniel Kilkelly of "Digital Spy" called Halfway a "cheery soul". Brown ("Radio Times") described Halfway as "loveable" and a "cheeky chappie", while Hughes ("Radio Times") called Halfway a "chirpy chap" who is "troubled" when he returns. A "Soaplife" reporter described Halfway as a "sweet and simple soldier", who is also slow-witted.
Relationships.
Whitney Dean.
Producers established a relationship for Halfway when they paired him with Whitney Dean, who is Lee's former wife. Brown ("Radio Times") said that Halfway "anxiously prepares" for his date with Whitney. Rory O'Connor from the Daily Express said that Halfway "gives Whitney a shock" when she thinks Halfway is proposing marriage. Lindsay ("Metro") reported that following the date, Halfway continues to show his feelings for Whitney and starts "to win her round with his likeable personality." Clay said that although Halfway is not Whitney's typical boyfriend, his effort and charm would impress her. He felt that his characteristics were more appealing to Whitney than his appearance. He added that the shared love between Halfway and Whitney makes them a nice couple. Clay liked Halfway and Whitney's relationship and looked forward to seeing it develop. When Halfway arranges a second date, a romantic meal on the roof of The Queen Vic, Clay said, "It's that kind of thing that you fall in love with." He told Laura-Jayne Tyler of "Inside Soap" that his relationship with Whitney and the romantic meal helped alter the audience's opinion of Halfway as it showed he is a "hopeless romantic". Tyler found Halfway's location for the date amusing because in a recent storyline, Whitney's friend, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), died after a fall from there. She described his actions as "thoughtful", but commented, "And they say romance is dead!" A journalist from "Soaplife" pointed out that Halfway makes Whitney smile, which they said is not easy considering Whitney's relationship history. Callum Crumlish of the "Daily Express" described Halfway and Whitney's relationship as "unlikely".
Following his departure in February, Morgan hoped that producers planned to reintroduce the character by quitting his army job and returning to be in a relationship with Whitney. When he reappeared in the following episode and kissed Whitney, fans expressed their delight at the potential relationship.
In Halfway's absence, Whitney's former boyfriend, Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan), returns to Walford. When Halfway returns, he is not bothered by Woody's presence as he is not afraid of Whitney's former partners. Clay explained that Halfway is "oblivious" to Woody because he is in love with Whitney and has the backing of the Carter family. Ben Lee of "Digital Spy" thought that Halfway's return would be good for Whitney as it suggested that their relationship would continue, while "Digital Spy" Laura Morgan thought that Halfway would be the ideal partner for Whitney despite not matching the profile of her usual partner. Clay explained that Halfway returns to Walford because he wants to develop his relationship with Whitney, which he treasures. He told Rachel Lucas of "What's on TV" that Halfway sees his relationship with Whitney as "a new life". Halfway's intimacy issues are explored through his relationship with Whitney when she tries to get intimate with him. Clay stated that this shows another dimension to his character. He explained that Halfway struggles to connect with people and often misses prompts from other people, such as Whitney. On-screen, Halfway reveals that he is struggling to be intimate with Whitney because he is a virgin. In April 2018, Clay stated that he was open to Halfway and Whitney marrying, adding that he would love to film a soap wedding.
Other characters.
As a friend of the Carter family, Halfway shares many scenes with them. Morgan pointed out that he had become "an honorary Carter" and a "surrogate older son" for Mick and Linda in the absence of their sons, Lee and Johnny Carter (Ted Reilly), adding that Halfway could be considered "a lucky charm for the continually-cursed Carters". Clay explained that the Carters help Halfway feel like a member of their family. He described the Carter family as his "surrogate "EastEnders" family". He stated that everyone, in particular Bright, had looked after him after joining the show. Clay wanted to explore other parts of his character's personality and thought there was the opportunity to explore dramatic storylines for Halfway.
Mick's mother, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), calls Halfway "Halfwit" in the show due to his dim-witted personality. Clay enjoyed the nickname, which he called "fun", and thought it was accurate at times. He explained that Halfway accepts the nickname that Shirley has given him because although he understands that it is not the nickname associated with him, he does want to argue with Shirley. Clay said that he and Henry share a good relationship. When Halfway returns and is offered Shirley's bedroom, he feels awkward about the situation because of Halfway and Shirley's relationship, but Clay found the situation amusing.
When asked where he wanted his character to be in a year, Clay replied that he wanted his close relationships developed further. He added, "I'd like to just see him quite happy, but with a lot of stuff going on, a lot of fingers in different pies." Clay hoped that Lee would be reintroduced to the series and thought it would be "amazing" to see what would happen between Halfway and Lee. Clay is familiar with Hatchard as they studied alongside each other. Clay told Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") that there are several characters that he wants to star alongside, including Dot Branning (June Brown), the Slater family, Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick).
Family.
Plans to introduce Halfway's brother, Stuart Highway, were announced on 28 March 2018. Actor Ricky Champ was cast in the role of Stuart, who arrives in spring following Halfway's return from the Army. Clay thought that Stuart's introduction supported Halfway's presence on the show and found that it added a new "dynamic" to the character. He explained that Stuart's arrival would spark a change in Halfway's attitude. Stuart is knowledgeable and cunning, which contrasts with Halfway's dim-witted personality. He is also more confident than Halfway. Clay believed that the differences in their personalities is evident. Sometimes, Halfway admires his brother, but other times, he can feel untrusting of Stuart. Clay opined that their relationship is "quite Marmite at times". Clay told Duncan Lindsay of the "Metro" that Halfway has "a need to feel included by his brother". Stuart and Mick are childhood friends, which Halfway dislikes as he does not want Stuart to ruin his friendship with the Carter family. Stuart has a dark personality, which Clay thought would allow the audience to see "what makes Halfway who he is". He expected the audience to pick up on moments of animosity between the brothers and warned them to be frightened of Stuart. Clay commented, "The relationship with his brother will be quite telling, and that'll be an interesting thing to watch." Producers used Stuart's introduction to explore Halfway's backstory, specifically his childhood. Clay explained that Halfway's childhood shaped his personality and confirmed that there would be an insight into a past event that has affected Halfway.
Reception.
After his first few episodes, Gary Gillatt, writing for "Inside Soap", hoped that Halfway would stay in the series because of his "tons of charisma". Reporters from "Digital Spy" liked the character, with Laura Morgan calling him "the kind of light comic relief we've all needed at the start of 2018." Morgan's colleague, Ben Lee, described Halfway's initial stint on the show as "a very eventful few weeks", while Daniel Kilkelly and Sophie Dainty pointed out that Halfway had "proved popular with fans" during his initial stint on "EastEnders". Morgan found the character funny and liked his "infectious energy and warmth". She compared him to former character Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) and thought that he could become Dot Branning's lodger, as Fatboy was. On Clay's performance as Halfway, Morgan opined, "It's never easy being the new fish in such a famous big pond, but he's settled in more quickly than most, and made the part of Halfway 100% his own." Tyler of "Inside Soap" opined that Halfway is "the real treasure to emerge from the bonkers plot [the heist storyline]". She added, "Square chiefs had clearly found a diamond in the rough with actor Tony Clay". Rachel Lucas of "What's on TV" described Halfway as the "unlikely villain [who] shot Mick Carter during Aidan Maguire's botched robbery! But he redeemed himself by helping Mick Carter save The Vic and then he won Whitney Carter's heart." A "Soaplife" columnist called Halfway "a welcome ray of sunshine in the bleak world of Albert Square".
Clay said that after his first appearance, he received "a few looks" from members of the public and several messages from fans on Twitter asking "Dude, what have you done?", as people believed that he had shot Mick. He recalled the first time that he was recognised in public, calling it "quite surreal" and "an odd moment". He added that he received positive feedback from the audience after becoming embedded into the cast. Clay told Tyler of "Inside Soap" that when a fan recognised him on the train, he did not know how to react, but explained that he was friendly and took a photo with her.
For his portrayal of Halfway, Clay was nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the 2018 "Digital Spy" Reader Awards; he came in seventh place with 5.4% of the total votes. His introduction was also nominated for "Most Bizarre Soap Storyline"; he came in sixth place with 8% of the total votes.

History of Wuhan

The prefecture-level city of Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China, has a long and rich history that dates back over 3,500 years. Starting out from the Shang Dynasty-era archaeological site at Panlongcheng associated with Erligang culture, the region would become part of the E state and Chu state during the Zhou dynasty. The region evolved into an important port on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the cities of Hanyang, Hankou and Wuchang were united into the city of Wuhan in 1926. Wuhan briefly serving as the capital city of China in 1927 and in 1937. Modern-day Wuhan is known as 'China's Thoroughfare' () due to its status as a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.
Antiquity.
With a 3,500-year-long history, Wuhan is one of the most ancient and civilized metropolitan cities in China. Panlongcheng, an archaeological site associated with the Erligang culture, is located in modern-day Huangpi District. During the Western Zhou, the E state controlled the present-day Wuchang area south of the Yangtze River. After the conquest of the E state, the present-day Wuhan area was controlled by the Chu state for the rest of the Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou periods.
Early Imperial China.
During the Han dynasty, Hanyang became a fairly busy port. The Battle of Xiakou in AD 203 and Battle of Jiangxia five years later were fought over control of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day eastern Hubei). In the winter of 208/9, one of the most famous battles in Chinese history and a central event in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"—the Battle of Red Cliffs—took place in the vicinity of the cliffs near Wuhan. Around that time, walls were built to protect Hanyang (AD 206) and Wuchang (AD 223). The latter event marks the foundation of Wuhan. In AD 223, the Yellow Crane Tower (), one of the Four Great Towers of China, was constructed on the Wuchang side of the Yangtze River by order of Sun Quan, leader of the Eastern Wu.
Due to tensions between the Eastern Wu and Cao Wei states, in the autumn of 228, Cao Rui, grandson of Cao Cao and the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei, ordered the general Man Chong to lead troops to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan).
In 279, Wang Jun wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu, requesting that he order a military campaign against Eastern Wu. The emperor agreed, appointed Wang Jun as Prancing Dragon General () and ordered him to lead troops from Yi Province's capital, Chengdu, to invade Eastern Wu. Wang Jun and his army conquered strategic locations in Wu territory such as Xiling (西陵; in present-day Yichang, Hubei), Xiakou (夏口; present-day Hankou) and Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei). When the Jin invasion forces reached the Wu capital Jianye, the last Wu emperor Sun Hao surrendered, thus bringing an end to the conquest of Wu.
During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, the Wuhan area was part of the successive Southern dynasty states Liu Song (420–479), Southern Qi (479–502), Liang, and Western Liang.
In fall 550, Hou Jing sent Ren Yue to attack both Xiao Daxin and Xiao Fan's son Xiao Si (). Ren killed Xiao Si in battle, and Xiao Daxin, unable to resist, surrendered, allowing Hou to take his domain under control. Meanwhile, Xiao Guan, who had by now settled at Jiangxia (江夏, in modern Wuhan), was planning to attack Hou, but this drew Xiao Yi's ire—believing that Xiao Guan was intending to contend for the throne—and he sent Wang to attack Xiao Guan. Xiao Guan, not willing to engage Wang, abandoned Jiangxia and fled to Ru'nan (汝南, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), where he entered into an alliance with Eastern Wei's successor state Northern Qi (with Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang having seized the throne in summer 550) and was created the Prince of Liang as well. Meanwhile, Hou made Emperor Jianwen create him the Prince of Han.
In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu Mingche as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (). The opposing sides met at Dunkou (沌口, in modern Wuhan). Wu and Chunyu were able to ram Hua's, Northern Zhou's, and Western Liang's fleets, causing them to collapse. Hua and the Northern Zhou general Yuwen Zhi () were forced to flee to Western Liang's capital Jiangling. In light of the victory, Wu first captured Western Liang's Hedong Commandery (河東, part of modern Jingzhou), and then further put Jiangling under siege. Western Liang's Emperor Ming was forced to flee to the subsidiary fort of Ji'nan (紀南, near Jiangling).
The city has long been renowned as a center for the arts (especially poetry) and for intellectual studies. Cui Hao, a celebrated poet of the Tang dynasty, visited the building in the early 8th century; his poem made it the most celebrated building in southern China.
In spring 877, Wang Xianzhi captured E Prefecture (鄂州, in modern Wuhan). He then returned north, joining forces with Huang again, and they surrounded Song Wei at Song Prefecture (宋州, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Only after the imperial general Zhang Zimian () came to Song Wei's aid did the agrarian rebels release their hold on Song Wei. Wang Xianzhi then headed south, successively capturing An Prefecture (安州, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei) and Sui Prefecture (隨州, in modern Suizhou, Hubei), before further raiding Fu (復州, in modern Tianmen, Hubei) and Ying (郢州, in modern Jingmen, Hubei).
In winter 877, Huang Chao pillaged Qi and Huang (黃州, in modern Wuhan) Prefectures. The Tang general Zeng Yuanyu () defeated him, however, and he fled. In 894, Wu Tao () the prefect of Huang Prefecture (黃州, modern Wuhan), who was under Du Hong the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Wuhan), offered to submit to Yang Xingmi. In response, Du put Huang Circuit under siege. Yang sent Zhu to aid Wu. When another subordinate of Du's, Feng Jingzhang () the prefect of Qi Prefecture (蘄州, in modern Huanggang, Hubei) tried to intercept Zhu, Zhu put Qi Prefecture under siege but was initially unable to capture it. However, it appeared that subsequently, after Wu evacuated Huang Prefecture, Yang's forces were nevertheless able to hold it.
Before Kublai Khan arrived in 1259, word reached him that Möngke had died. Kublai decided to keep the death of his brother secret and continued the attack on Wuhan, near the Yangtze. While Kublai's force besieged Wuchang, Uryankhadai joined him. The present-day Wuying Pagoda was constructed at the end of the Song Dynasty between attacks by the Mongolian forces. Under the Mongol rulers (Yuan dynasty), Wuchang was promoted to the status of provincial capital.
Qing dynasty.
Opening Hankou as a trading port.
By the dawn of the 18th century, Hankou had become one of China's top four most important towns of trade. In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north–south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important transshipment point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities. The French had a concession in Hankou.
The forces of the Taiping Rebellion captured the Wuhan area in following the Battle of Wuchang in late 1852 and continued to hold the area and much of the lower Yangtze River region until the Heavenly Kingdom's defeat in 1864. Both urban and rural areas suffered severe damage as a result of constant fighting.
During the Second Opium War (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856–1860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the Treaties of Tianjin and the Convention of Peking, which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan. And in the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of along the Yangtze River (from Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road today) to become a British Concession and permitted Britain to set up its consulate in the concession. Thus, Hankou became an open trading port.
Hubei under Zhang Zhidong.
In 1889, Zhang Zhidong was transferred from Viceroy of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) to Viceroy of Huguang (Hunan and Hubei provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of "Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application," known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a zhen and a xie (both zhen and xie are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei. All of these laid a solid foundation for the modernization of Wuhan.
Originally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the Hanyang Arsenal was founded in 1891 by Qing official Zhang Zhidong, who diverted funds from the Nanyang Fleet in Guangdong to build the arsenal. It cost about 250,000 pounds sterling and was built in 4 years. On 23 April 1894, construction was completed and the arsenal, occupying some , could start production of small-calibre cannons. It built magazine-fed rifles, Gruson quick fire guns, and cartridges.
Wuchang Uprising.
On October 10, 1911, Sun Yat-sen's followers launched the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty, as well as the establishment of the Republic of China. Wuhan was the capital of a leftist Kuomintang government led by Wang Jingwei, in opposition to Chiang Kai-shek and the nationalist government during the 1920s.
The Wuchang Uprising of October 1911, which overthrew the Qing dynasty, originated in Wuhan. Before the uprising, anti-Qing secret societies were active in Wuhan. In September 1911, the outbreak of the protests in Sichuan forced the Qing authorities to send part of the New Army garrisoned in Wuhan to suppress the rebellion. On September 14 the Literary Society () and the Progressive Association (), two local revolutionary organizations in Hubei, set up joint headquarters in Wuchang and planned for an uprising. On the morning of October 9, a bomb at the office of the political arrangement exploded prematurely and alerted local authorities. The proclamation for the uprising, beadroll and the revolutionaries’ official seal fell into the hands of Rui Cheng, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei, who demolished the uprising headquarters the same day and set out to arrest the revolutionaries listed in the beadroll. This forced the revolutionaries to launch the uprising earlier than planned.
On the night of October 10, the revolutionaries fired shots to signal the uprising at the engineering barracks of Hubei New Army. They then led the New Army of all barracks to join the revolution. Under the guidance of Wu Zhaolin, Cai Jimin and others, this revolutionary army seized the official residence of the governor and government offices. Rui Cheng fled in panic into the Chu-Yu Ship. Zhang Biao, the commander of Qing army, also fled the city. On the morning of the 11th, the revolutionary army took the whole city of Wuchang, but leaders such as Jiang Yiwu and Sun Wu disappeared. Thus the leaderless revolutionary army recommended Li Yuanhong, the assistant governor of Qing army, as the commander-in-chief. Li founded the Hubei Military Government, proclaimed the abolition of the Qing rule in Hubei, the founding of the Republic of China and published an open telegram calling for other provinces to join the revolution. In the next two months, fourteen other provinces would declare their independence from the Qing government.
As the revolution spread to other parts of the country, the Qing government concentrated loyalist military forces to suppress the uprising in Wuhan. From October 17 to December 1, the revolutionary army and local volunteers defended the city in the Battle of Yangxia against better armed and more numerous Qing forces commanded by Yuan Shikai. Huang Xing () would arrive in Wuhan in early November to take command of the revolutionary army. After fierce fighting and heavy casualties, Qing forces seized Hankou and Hanyang. But Yuan agreed to halt the advance on Wuchang and participated in peace talks, which would eventually lead to the return of Sun Yat-sen from exile, founding of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912, the abdication of the Last Emperor on February 12, and the formation of a united provisional government in the spring of 1912. Through the Wuchang Uprising, Wuhan is known as the birthplace of the Xinhai Revolution, named after the Xinhai year on the Chinese calendar. The city has several museums and memorials to the revolution and the thousands of martyrs who died defending the revolution.
Republic of China.
Missionaries.
Reverend (later Bishop) Edward Galvin led the first band of the Missionary Society of St. Columban to open their mission in the Hanyang District. Galvin was named Apostolic Prefect of the Apostolic Prefecture of Hanyang by the Holy See in 1923 and later made the Apostolic Vicar of the promoted Apostolic Vicariate of Hanyang in 1927, with Galvin being consecrated as its titular bishop (it became a diocese under him in 1946, suffragan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hankou).
National government moves its capital to Wuhan.
Li Zongren's first victories as a Nationalist general were in Hunan, where he defeated rival warlord Wu Peifu in two successive battles and captured the provincial capital, Wuhan, in 1926. With the northern extension of the Northern Expedition, the center of the Great Revolution shifted from the Pearl River basin to the Yangtze River basin. On November 26, the KMT Central Political Committee decided to move the capital from Guangzhou to Wuhan. In middle December, most of the KMT central executive commissioners and national government commissioners arrived in Wuhan, set up the temporary joint conference of central executive commissioners and National Government commissioners, performed the top functions of central party headquarters and National Government, declared they would work in Wuhan on January 1, 1927, and decided to combine the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang into Wuhan City, called "Capital District". The national government was in the Nanyang Building in Hankou, while the central party headquarters and other organizations chose their locations in Hankou or Wuchang. In March 1927, Mao Zedong appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. The first phase of the Northern Expedition was interrupted by the political split in the Kuomintang following the formation of the Nanjing faction in April 1927 against the existing faction in Wuhan. Members of the Chinese Communist Party, who had survived the April 12 massacre, met at Wuhan and re-elected Chen Duxiu (Ch'en Tu-hsiu) as the Party's Secretary General. The split was partially motivated by the purge of the Communists within the party, which marked the end of the First United Front, and Chiang Kai-shek briefly stepped down as the commander of the National Revolutionary Army.
In June 1927, Stalin sent a telegram to the Communists in Wuhan, calling for mobilisation of an army of workers and peasants. This alarmed Wang Jingwei, who decided to break with the Communists and come to terms with Chiang Kai-shek. The Wuhan coup was a political shift made on July 15, 1927 by Wang Jingwei towards Chiang Kai-shek, and his Shanghai-based rival in the Kuomintang (KMT). Borodin returned to the Soviet Union by train in July 1927, accompanied by Sun Yat-sen's widow Soong Ching-ling. "The revolution extends to the Yangzi River," Borodin told a reporter as they began their journey, and "if a diver were sent down to the bottom of this yellow stream he would rise again with an armful of shattered hopes." On July 27, 1927, Soviet emissary Mikhail Borodin and 30 people left Wuhan in five cars and five trucks to return to the USSR in a two-month overland trip, after General Feng Yuxiang was bribed to guarantee him safe passage—twelve days after Chinese Communists were expelled. Borodin had had a bounty of US$29,000 for his capture, and had hidden in the home of Nationalist official and future Chinese Premier T. V. Soong. Borodin finally returned to Moscow on October 6.
The Wuhan Nationalist Government was established in Wuhan on February 21, 1927 and ended by August 19, 1927.
Flooding in the 1930s.
In the 1931 China floods, the high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou, with the water level exceeding above normal. Comparatively, this is an average of above the Shanghai Bund. In 1936, when natural disaster struck Central China with widespread flooding affecting Hebei (), Hunan (), Jiangxi (), Wuhan and Chongqing () caused by the Yangtze and Huai Rivers () bursting their banks, Ong Seok Kim, as Chairman of the Sitiawan Fundraising and Disaster Relief Committee, raised money and materials in support of the victims.
Battle of Wuhan.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War and following the fall of Nanking in December 1937, Wuhan had become the provisional capital of China's Kuomintang government, and became another focal point of pitched air battles beginning in early 1938 between modern monoplane bomber and fighter aircraft of the Imperial Japanese forces and the Chinese Air Force, which included support from the Soviet Volunteer Group in both planes and personnel, as U.S. support in war materials waned. As the battle raged on through 1938, Wuhan and the surrounding region had become the site of the Battle of Wuhan. After being taken by the Japanese in late 1938, Wuhan became a major Japanese logistics center for operations in southern China.
In early October 1938, Japanese troops moved east and north in the outskirts of Wuhan. As a result, numerous companies and enterprises and large numbers of people had to withdraw from Wuhan to the west of Hubei and Sichuan. The KMT navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River on patrol and covering the withdrawal. On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT gunboat "Zhongshan" came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the "Zhongshan" sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the "Zhongshan" has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban Jiangxia District, which opened on September 26, 2011.
Bombing of Wuhan.
As a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China and the Chinese leadership in Chongqing, namely Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng and He Yingqin, approved the tactic of strategic firebombing of Japanese occupied city of Wuhan. In December 1944, the city was largely destroyed by U.S. firebombing raids conducted by the Fourteenth Air Force. On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city. For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as Japanese air bases in the city. The air raids killed thousands of Chinese civilians which American bombers did not know. "According to casualty statistics compiled by Hankou city in 1946, more than 20,000 were killed or injured in the December bombings of 1944."
Chinese Civil War.
People's Liberation Army troops entered Wuhan on May 16, 1949.
People's Republic of China.
1954 Yangtze River floods.
The Changjiang Water Resources Commission was re-established in February 1950 with its headquarters seated in Wuhan.
From June to September 1954, the Yangtze River Floods were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.
In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.
Completion of the First Yangtze River Bridge.
Before construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Hunslet Engine Company built two extra heavy 0-8-0 locomotives for loading the train ferries for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan.
The project of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. The Engineering Bureau of the First Yangtze River Bridge, set up by the Ministry of Railway in April 1953, was responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The document "Resolutions on Building the First Yangtze River Bridge" was passed in the 203rd conference of State Council on January 15, 1954. The technical conference on the routes of the bridge, held in Hankou on January 15, 1955, determined that the route from Tortoise Hill to Snake Hill was the best choice.
On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The bridge is long, of which the upper level is a highway with a width of and the lower level is a double-line railway with a width of . The bridge proper is long with two pairs of eight piers and nine arches with a space of between each arch. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the Beijing–Hankou Railway with the Guangdong–Hankou Railway into the Beijing–Guangzhou Railway, making Wuhan a thoroughfare to nine provinces in name and in fact.
Beidaihe Conference.
After Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.
Wuhan Incident.
In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the Wuhan Incident ("July 20th Incident"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.
Crash of Wuhan Airlines Flight 343.
On June 22, 2000, a Wuhan Airlines flight from Enshi to Wuhan was forced to circle for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms. The aircraft eventually crashed on the banks of Han River in Hanyang District, all on-board perished (there were varying accounts of number of crews and passengers). In addition, the crash also killed 7 people on the ground.
2008 Summer Olympics Boycotts.
Chinese protesters organized boycotts of the French-owned retail chain Carrefour in major Chinese cities including Kunming, Hefei and Wuhan, accusing the French nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-Chinese racism. The BBC reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in Beijing, Wuhan, Hefei, Kunming and Qingdao.
Internet Firewall.
On May 19, 2011, Fang Binxing, the Principal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (also known as "Father of China's Great Fire Wall") was hit on the chest by a shoe thrown at him by a Huazhong University of Science and Technology student who calls herself "hanunyi" (Chinese:寒君依, or 小湖北) while Fang was giving a lecture at Wuhan University. According to RFI, the student discussed the planned shoe attack on Twitter and, with the help of other bloggers, was able to locate the exact whereabouts and the time of Fang's lecture. After the shoeing, "Hanunyi" walked out while other students tried to obstruct school teachers who were going to detain her. "Hanunyi" became an instant internet hero of the Chinese blogosphere. During an interview with CNN, "Hanunyi" said, "I'm not happy about what (Fang) does. His work made me spend unnecessary money to get access to the website that is supposed to be free... He makes my online surfing very inconvenient."
Flooding in the 2010s.
The city has been subject to devastating floods, which are now supposed to be controlled by the ambitious Three Gorges Dam, a project which was completed in 2008. The 2008 Chinese winter storms damaged water supply equipment in Wuhan: up to 100,000 people were out of running water when several water pipes burst, cutting the supply to local households. The 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave hit Wuhan on July 3.
In the 2010 China floods, the Han River at Wuhan experienced its worst flooding in twenty years, as officials continued sandbagging efforts along the Han and Yangtze Rivers in the city and checked reservoirs. In the 2011 China floods, Wuhan was flooded, with parts of the city losing power.
In the 2016 China floods, Wuhan saw of rainfall during the first week of July, surpassing the record that fell on the city in 1991. A red alert for heavy rainfall was issued on 2 July, the same day that eight people died after a section of a tall wall collapsed on top of them. The city's subway system, the Wuhan Metro was partially submerged as was the main railway station. At least 14 city residents were killed, one was missing, and more than 80,000 were relocated.
On January 31, 2018, Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, visited Wuhan, spoke at Wuhan University and visited the Yellow Crane Tower and the First Yangtze River Bridge. She took pictures at the Yellow Crane Tower and on the Wuchang District side of the Yangtze River at the First Yangtze River Bridge.
COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic had its first major outbreak in Wuhan in November or December 2019. The city was placed under lockdown in January 2020 to control the spread of the disease.

Piero Martinetti

Piero Martinetti (Pont Canavese, 21 August 1872 – Cuorgnè, 23 March 1943) was an Italian philosopher. Martinetti was professor of theoretical and moral philosophy. He was one of the few university professors, as well as the only Italian academic philosopher, to refuse to swear an oath of allegiance to the Fascist Party.
Early life and education.
Pier Federico Giuseppe Celestino Mario Martinetti was the first of four children. His parents were Rosalia Bertogliatti (1846–1927) and Francesco Martinetti (1846–1921). After completing his secondary school education at the Liceo classico Carlo Botta in Ivrea, Pietro went on to study Philosophy at the University of Turin, graduating at the age of 21 in 1893 with a dissertation on the Samkhya system in Indian philosophy. Despite some initial resistance from the Philosophy department, the dissertation was published by Lattes in 1896 and won the Gautieri Prize. Martinetti's interest in Indian philosophy was long lasting, including a cycle of lectures held in Milan in 1920, collected and published in 1981. After graduation Martinetti spend two semesters (1894–95) at Leipzig University, where he encountered the thought of Afrikan Spir.
Career.
After returning to Italy, Martinetti worked as a secondary school teacher in Avellino (1899-1900), Correggio (1900-1901), Vigevano (1901-1902), Ivrea (1903-1904) and at the Liceo classico statale Vittorio Alfieri in Turin (1904-1905). In 1904 he published his introduction to metaphysics ('Introduzione alla metafisica. I Teoria della conoscenza') thanks to which he was appointed professor of theoretical and moral philosophy at the Accademia scientifico-letteraria in Milan - which was to become, in 1923, the University of Milan - where he taught from 1906 to 1931. In 1915 he became an honorary fellow of the Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere, founded in 1797 by Napoleon an modelled on the Institut de France.
Political views.
Martinetti was a maverick intellectual figure, independent of traditional political affiliations as well as of the Catholic tradition. He refused to adhere both to Giovanni Gentile's Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals and to Croce's Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. He was one of the few intellectuals to critique the First World War: he thought that war subverted social order and moral values, creating idleness and dissolution, and giving the military decision making powers which it should not have, based either on moral or intellectual value. In 1923, following some very difficult occurrences (the March on Rome and Mussolini's rise to power) he refused an honorary fellowship at the prestigious Accademia dei Lincei.
The Society for Philosophical and Religious Studies.
While in his lectures Martinetti was developing his own philosophy of religion, on 5 January 1920, in Milan, he co-founded the 'Società di studi filosofici e religiosi' ("Society for Philosophical and Religious Studies"), together with some friends, fully independent of any dogmatism. The aim was to gather a number of Italian intellectuals and hold a series of conferences.
In 1926 Martinetti was sued for 'contempt for the Eucharist'; as a consequence, he was forced to sign a defence of his courses on philosophy of religion.
The Philosophy Congress.
In March 1926, Martinetti organised the VI National Philosophy Congress on behalf of the Italian Philosophical Society, aiming for a free expression of ideas despite a difficult political context. The event was suspended after only two days because of protests from fascist and Catholic activists. After that, the Congress was cancelled, partly due to the opposition of Agostino Gemelli, Vice-Chancellor of the Catholic University of Milan.
"The Philosophical Journal".
From 1927, Martinetti edited the philosophical journal "Rivista di filosofia"; however, his name never appeared on the publication, due to the controversies surrounding him. He wanted to continue to participate and foster philosophical thought in Italy in the ways that were still accessible to him, despite his refusal to swear an oath of allegiance to the Fascist party. The refusal prevented him from teaching, but not from collaborating in publications such as the "La Rivista di Filosofia", which he considered partly as his brainchild.
Refusal to support the Fascist Party.
Martinetti unhesitatingly refused to swear allegiance to the Fascist party in December 1931; he was one of the very few university professors to do so. He explained his reasons in a letter to the Ministry of Education Balbino Giuliano. In the letter, he explains that he cannot betray his own conscience, the only true light and comfort a person can have, and declares readiness to bear the consequences of that action. Following his rejection of fascism, Martinetti was forced to retire. From 1932 until his death, he devoted himself to his philosophical studies, in the company of a number of cats, in his house in Spineto, close to his birthplace. On his door, an inscription read: "Piero Martinetti - agricoltore" ("Piero Martinetti - farmer"). During this time, he studied the works of Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant and wrote "Gesù Cristo e il Cristianesimo" ("Jesus Christ and Christianity") (1934); "Il Vangelo" ("The Gospel") (1936); "Ragione e fede" ("Reason and Faith") (1942).
Arrest.
These quiet studies were interrupted by a sudden arrest and imprisonment in Turin in May 1935 accused by Pitigrilli, (an agent of the Organisation for the Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism) of conniving with the antifascist group G. The accusation was unfounded. Pitigrilli also caused the arrest, with the same allegations, of several Italian intellectuals, including Giulio Einaudi, Vittorio Foa, Cesare Pavese and Carlo Levi. At the moment of his arrest, Martinetti was reported to have said, as many times before: "I am a European citizen, born in Italy by chance"
Final years.
Martinetti started to decline in 1941, after an episode of thrombosis following an accidental fall off a pear tree, which also eroded his mental faculties. In 1942 and 1943 he had two prostate operations. He died in hospital in Turin (at the time evacuated in Cuorgnè), on 23 March 1943, after requesting that no priest would intervene on his body. Despite the Vicar of Spineto urged not to honour the body of a man who had always been a 'heretic' and 'atheist' in his lifetime, about ten people followed the funeral van to the train station, from where Martinetti's corpse was taken to Turin to be cremated.
Legacy.
Shortly before his death, Martinetty bequeathed his private book collection to Nina Ruffini, Gioele Solari and Cesare Giretti.
The collection was then donated to the "Fondazione Piero Martinetti per gli studi di storia filosofica e religiosa" ("Piero Martinetti Foundation for the study of the history of philosophy and religion") in 1955. It is now part of the Library of the Facoltà di Lettere e Filosofia at the University of Turin
His house in Spineto currently hosts the headquarters of the "Fondazione Casa e Archivio Piero Martinetti", which aims to promote Martinetti's thought both in Italy and internationally.
Philosophy.
Martinetti's philosophy includes an original interpretation of neo-Kantian idealism, interpreted as transcendent pantheistic dualism. This interpretation is close to that of Afrikan Spir, who was Martinetti's favourite philosopher. Martinetti wrote a long monograph on Spir, which was published after his death in 1990. Martinetti thought that Spir's metaphysics was a pure form of religious vision, fundamentally expressed in the dualism between real being (the absolute transcendent Unity through which divinity is expressed) and the multiple apparent being revealed by experience. This dualism, at the same time, is apparent: it is not a distinction between two actual realities, but between the only reality and the unreality in which the world sinks.
Martinetti also inherited Spir's moral philosophy with very few modifications, which in turn was derived from Kant. For Martinetti, after Kant, "no serious philosopher can avoid being Kantian in ethics".
Animals.
In "La psiche degli animali" ("The Psyche of Animals"), Martinetti argues that, like humans, animals possess intellect and consciousness. Therefore, ethics cannot be limited to regulating relationships among humans, but it needs to aim to ensure the wellbeing and happiness of all sentient forms of life, which like human beings are capable of experiencing pleasure, happiness and pain.
In this essay, Martinetti also observes how the great Western religions have ignored the problem of the unspeakable suffering inflicted by human beings on other animals. Instead, Martinetti argues, in the eyes of other animals we can see the deep unity that ties us to them. He himself felt deep sympathy and compassion for animals, which was reflected in his vegetarianism.
In his will, Martinetti left a significant sum of money to the "Società Protettrice degli Animali" ("Society for the Protection of Animals").

Louisa Grace Beauclerk, Duchess of St Albans

Louisa Grace Beauclerk, Duchess of St Albans (1777 – 19 February 1816), formerly Lady Louisa Grace Manners, was the second wife of Aubrey Beauclerk, 6th Duke of St Albans.
She was one of the youngest of the seven children of John Manners, MP, and his wife Louisa Tollemache, 7th Countess of Dysart. Her nephew, Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, succeeded her mother in the earldom when the latter died in 1840, aged 95. 
She married the duke on 15 August 1802 in London, a few months after he succeeded his father in the dukedom. He had previously been married to Jane Moses, who died in 1800, leaving one daughter. The new duchess was said to have been "one of the brightest stars in the fashionable hemisphere" in the early years of her marriage.
They had one child, Aubrey Beauclerk, 7th Duke of St Albans (7 April 1815 – 19 February 1816); the duke, described as "a weak and sickly man", died, aged 50, four months after the child's birth.
The duchess died on the same day as her son; both died at the home of her sister, the former Lady Laura Manners, wife of John Dalrymple, in Portman Square, London. Louisa had been "in a delicate state of health" since the death of her husband, and contemporary reports say that she died three hours after the child. Both were buried at Hanwell. The dukedom passed to a younger brother of the 6th Duke.

Jóngerð Purkhús

Jóngerð Jensina Purkhús (born 1937) is a Faroese politician and feminist who has been an active member of the Republic Party. She became the first female minister in the Faroe Islands when she was appointed Minister of Finance, Economy and the Environment in 1985. In 1989, she was appointed Minister of the Economy, Social Affairs and the Judiciary, serving until 1991.
Biography.
Born in Klaksvik on 22 January 1937, Jóngerð Jensina Purkhús is the daughter of Jacob Pauli Purkhús (1908–90), a fisherman, and his wife Else Johanne Hansen (born 1912). Her family were not academically inclined but they were politically attached to the social and political ambitions of the Republic Party which sought independence from Denmark. Klasvik was also the centre of strikes leading to clashes with the Danish authorities. This no doubt led to Purkhús' interest in nationalism and her decision to study political science.
She completed her school education in 1953, without matriculating. After working for a few years in Klasvik, she moved to Copenhagen in 1960 where she worked at a grocer's during the day and attended the "Akademisk Studenterkursus" (Academic Student Course) in the evenings. She then succeeded in passing the matriculation examination which allowed her to start reading political science at the University of Copenhagen while working at the Social Research Institute and as a medical assistant for the elderly. In 1972, she became the first Faroese to graduate as a Cand.polit.. After working for an accounting firm, she returned to the Faroes in 1975 taking up a governmental post where she oversaw the transfer of the Danish postal service to a Faroese entity. Thereafter she worked in the postal service's administration managing accounting and transfer arrangements. From 1978, she returned to a government posting where she dealt with financial legislation.
On the electoral front, she first stood as a candidate for Klaksvik in 1978. In the 1984 elections, she was one of three women who were elected to the Løgting, all of whom were elected as top candidates for their parties. For the Republic party, Purkhús received 620 votes and Karin Kjølbro 504, while for the Social Democrats, Marita Petersen received 385. In 1985, in the coalition with the Social Democrats, the New Self-Government and the People's Party, Purkhús was appointed Minister of Finance and the Environment, becoming the first Faroese female minister. From 1988 to 1989, she was elected to the Løgting, representing the Republic party. In the new coalition in 1989 of the Republicans, the People's Party and the Union Party, she was Minister of the Economy, Social Affairs and the Judiciary until 1991. She remained in the Løgting for a number of years as a member of the Republic party before she withdrew from politics.
Since 1976, Purkhús has lived in Velbastaður where her interests are livestock, folk dancing and patchwork.

Susmita Basu Majumdar is an Indian historian, epigraphist and numismatist. She is a professor in the Department of Ancient Indian History at the University of Calcutta. With her nom-de-plume "Adaa", she is a poet in the Hindi and Urdu languages, and a musician.
Life.
Susmita Basu Majumdar obtained a bachelor's degree from Lady Brabourne College, followed by master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Calcutta.
Research.
Ashokan Circuit.
In 1986, the roof of the Chandrala Parameshwari Temple at Sannati, Karnataka collapsed, revealing Brahmi inscriptions on the stone base of the deity. These comprised edicts 1 and 2 and rock edicts 12 and 14 of Ashoka, revealing Sannati as an important Buddhist shrine from the Mauryan period. Calcutta University began a project to document the Ashokan circuit in Karnataka. Majumdar was heading the project in 2016 when the broken original idol of Mahakali was found outside the temple walls, resulting in the restoration of the idol.
Majumdar published booklets on the Ashokan circuit ("The Mauryans in Karnataka") and a trilingual English-Pali-Kannada dictionary.
Numismatics and epigraphy.
Majumdar investigated the shaping of trade by foreign and domestic currencies on the Malabar coast. Contrasting the prevalence of Roman copper coins in Chola and Pandya territories with the preponderance of Roman silver coins (and lack of copper coins) in Chera territories, she showed that this was likely due to the Cheras being the regional power in Kerala, issuing copper coins. She introduced a methodology to examine the commerce between Rome and India based on the coinage unearthed at Pattanam.
Kushan coinage in Bengal.
A cache of 83 coins was found in East Midnapore by Aurobindo Maity, a retired high school teacher attempting to locate and archive informal relics in the region. These were identified as Kushan coins from the periods of Kanishka and Huvishka, as part of Majumdar's research.
Music and poetry.
Majumdar has collaborated with santoor maestro Pandit Sandip Chatterjee in an album titled "Lyrical Fusion", providing lyrics in Urdu as well as vocals.
Her book "Triangulum: Trilingual poetry" comprising her poetry in Urdu was published in 2015.

Baqir Brigade

The Baqir Brigade ("Liwa al-Baqir", sometimes also "Liwa al-Imam al-Baqir" or "Fawj al-Imam Baqir"), named after Shia Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, is a Syrian loyalist militia originating in the Aleppo Governorate that fights in the Syrian Civil War. One of the most prominent and largest pro-government militias from the Aleppo area and part of the "Local Defence Forces" network, the Baqir Brigade mostly consists of tribesmen from the al-Baggara tribe that traditionally supported the rule of the al-Assad family despite being mostly Sunni Muslim. Though the militia's fighters thus come from a largely Sunni background, many of them have converted to or are at least strongly influenced by Shia Islam. Indeed, the Baqir Brigade has been noted for its strong connections to the Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran, and various Iraqi Shia militias, and is thus generally considered to be a Shia or "Shi'ified" fighting force.
History.
Foundation and early operations.
There are conflicting accounts on when and how the Baqir Brigade was founded. The unit itself and its supporters claim that it was set up in 2012, just after the start of the Battle of Aleppo. Its founders were the brothers Khalid al-Hassan ("nom de guerre": "al-Hajj Khalid" or "al-Hajj Baqir") and Abu al-Abbas ("nom de guerre": "al-Hajj Hamza") who had fought as volunteers with Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and started the Baqir Brigade after their father and older brother had been killed by rebels. Their unit initially had only 13 members, but allegedly soon managed to garner hundreds of recruits due to the charisma and military talent of the two brothers. According to this version, the brothers' militia also helped to break the siege of Aleppo's central prison during Operation Canopus Star in 2013/14.
On the other side, the pro-opposition site "alSouria.net" argued that the Baqir Brigade was founded as part of the Local Defence Forces in 2015. With its fighters trained by Iraqi Shia militants and put under the protection of the Berri family (which is well known for its support of the al-Assad family), "alSouria.net" claimed that the militia was an attempt to create more native Shia pro-government units. Around this time, the Baqir Brigade reportedly operated under the leadership of the Iraqi Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, which also equipped its members. Regional expert Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi found evidence for the Baqir Brigade's existence as far back as 2014. He argues that some kind of militia led by Khalid and Abu al-Abbas indeed originated in 2012, but that this earlier formation was reorganized or consolidated into the present-day Baqir Brigade only as part of the Local Defence Forces with strong Iranian and Hezbollah support around 2014.
Operations since 2015.
While its foundation and early operations are not well documented, the Baqir Brigade's involvement in the fighting in and around Aleppo since 2015 is better known. The militia took part in a government offensive south of the city in late 2015, and helped lifting the Siege of Nubl and al-Zahraa during the Northern Aleppo offensive of February 2016. Alongside its Hezbollah and Iraqi allies, the Baqir Brigade also fought at Tel Al-Eis in course of the 2016 Southern Aleppo campaign. The militia also took part in the final military operations in the city. In course of the important Aleppo offensive (October–November 2016), the Baqir Brigade secured the New Aleppo Neighborhood against heavy attacks by rebels forces, among them troops of the Army of Conquest, and then fought in the offensive of November and December 2016 that resulted in the complete reconquest of the city by government forces.
The Baqir Brigade, alongside other Iranian-backed militias, spearheaded the Syrian Desert campaign (May–July 2017), and fought against U.S.-supported rebel troops in the region around al-Tanf. In February 2018, the Baqir Brigade and other pro-government forces directly clashed with the United States Armed Forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) during the Battle of Khasham in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Despite this, the Baqir Brigade sent volunteers to aid the SDF in Afrin Region when the latter was invaded by Turkey and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army during Operation Olive Branch. Declaring their support for Afrin's SDF defenders, the Baqir Brigade announced that it would lead local pro-government forces "against FSA terrorists and Turks". One analyst argued that the militia's intervention in Afrin intended to improve relations between pro-government factions (including Iran) and the Syrian Kurds who form the SDF's core.
On 6 April 2018, the Baqir Brigade declared jihad on U.S. and Turkish forces in Syria, vowing to "liberate every single inch of the precious homeland" from American and Turkish forces and to "defend the unity of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic nation." Accordingly, it would start "resistance operations" against the U.S.-led coalition forces in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. The pro-opposition news site El-Dorar Al-Shamia claimed that the Baqir Brigade along with Hezbollah launched raid against the SDF in the western suburbs of Deir ez-Zor on 29 April 2018, though this was not independently verified. Around the same time, a Twitter account linked to the group posted the photo of a hill near Manbij, where U.S. troops are stationed, along with the threat "You are in our line of fire." In June 2018, the Baqir Brigade and other Syrian militias attended a conference in Eastern Aleppo Governorate, titled "Syrian tribes against foreign intervention and the American presence on Syrian soil". An expert of the Turkey-based think tank Omran Dirasat also argued that the Baqir Brigade had begun to train the Popular Resistance of the Eastern Region, a pro-government militant group that was taking part in the anti-SDF insurgency of eastern Syria.
According to pro-opposition media, the Baqir Brigade was among the military units that were mobilized to guard Aleppo's airports after Israeli airstrikes in March 2019. Two months later, Syrian news site Jorf News claimed that members of the Baqir Brigade were training naval combat in Latakia Governorate.
On 15 September 2019, the group threatened to attack the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in Deir ez-Zor, following the threats Syrian army and Liwa al-Quds reinforcements were sent to reportedly ease tensions between the Baqir Brigade and SDF. By early 2020, the Baqir Brigade was contributing troops to a government offensive in northwestern Syria. One of the militia's commanders, Juma al Ahmad, was killed during this operation. In late 2020, Iran organized a recruitment drive for the Baqir Brigade in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Around this time, the group dispatched troops to help combat the ISIL insurgency in the Syrian Desert.
Politics.
Ideology and Shia proselytization.
The Baqir Brigade portrays itself as Syrian nationalist force, "the first auxiliary [/reserve]" of the Syrian Army, and as part of the wider "Islamic Resistance" against Salafism and Zionism. It consequently often uses the portraits of the Axis of Resistance's leaders Bashar al-Assad, Hassan Nasrallah, and Ali Khamenei, as well as imagery and language resembling that of Hezbollah (including its flag). As part of the "Islamic Resistance", the unit also refers to its fighters as mujahideen and prominently propagates those who have been killed in combat as martyrs.
Strongly connected to Iran, the Baqir Brigade is believed to be part of an Iranian attempt to not just spread its political influence in Syria but to also spread Shia Islam in the region. In consequence, the militia mostly recruits converts to Shia Islam drawn from Syrian tribes. Most of the group's fighters are tribesmen belonging to the al-Baggara who were the target of successful Iranian-backed proselytization efforts before the civil war, with up to 25% of the tribe converting. One reason for this success is the purported descent of the al-Baggara from Muhammad al-Baqir, the Shia Imam after whom the Baqir Brigade is named. The unit also has Sunni Muslim members.
Fighters of the Baqir Brigade are trained and thus influenced by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah, and Iraqi Shia militants. Khalid al-Hassan was also once photographed with Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force. The Baqir Brigade has also voiced support for the Yemeni Houthi movement, another group suspected being linked to Iran. These international connections have led some analysts to claim that the Baqir Brigade is controlled by Iran.
Involvement in governance and civil affairs.
The militia also takes part in civil politics. It is connected to Omar Hussein al-Hassan, who has been described as "political leader" of the Baqir Brigade. The militia consequently supported him as independent candidate during the Syrian parliamentary elections of 2016 and of 2020. The militia also works with the Syrian State Ministry for the Affairs of National Reconciliation, and consequently tried to mediate between rival factions in Aleppo. In one notable case, it helped to conciliate the influential Abu Ra's and Berri clans. In 2017, the militia also coordinated the reconciliation of Nawaf al-Bashir, a prominent al-Baggara tribal leader and former supporter of the Syrian opposition, with the government.
The group is known for distributing humanitarian aid in areas where it operates.

National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy Library

The National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy Library (, translit.: "Naukova biblioteka Natsional'noho universytetu "Kyyevo-Mohylians'ka akademiya"") is the library system of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, one of the oldest universities in Ukraine, founded in 1615, closed in 1817 and revived in 1991. It is a key academic resource that supports the teaching, learning, and research goals of the university; its various materials can be accessed by students, scholars, and the general public. Almost 70% are books and periodicals, donated by individuals, institutions and organizations from around the world. Library is composed of several locations across the university campus.
Amongst the collection are many rare items such as one of the four extant copies of "The Travels of Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch" by Paul of Aleppo.
History.
Estimated date of creation of the Kyiv Mohyla book collection is unknown. Approximately, it began to function in times of Kyiv Brotherhood School, since 1615. Significant contribution to the formation of the Library later did Petro Mohyla, who showed special concern in enriching library collections. He bequeathed his own book collection a few days before he died. But the terrible fire in 1658 almost completely destroyed the Library. By the 18yh century the Library has totaled 3,500 books in different languages, especially in Latin. By late 18 century there were 12 000 items. In the 19th century library was transferred to Kyiv Theological Academy with total collection approximately 150 000 items. Since 1920s part of Library is transferred to Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine. In 1992 library was opened in renewed University. It was firstly located in Blagovischennia Church and then in rooms of the revived university.
Closure of the Theological Academy in the early 20th century and events that followed the October Revolution, led to almost complete destruction of the Library. During the years of the totalitarian regime, most of the books were either lost or transferred to other institutions. Books that survived are now located in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.
Library locations and facilities.
Research Library.
Old Academic Building is one of the architectural landmarks of the Kontraktova Ploscha which is located on Podil, the oldest district of Kyiv. It has a complicated history of reconstructions, both functional and decorative. The original one-storied building was finished in 1703. The second floor and the Church of the Annunciation in the far eastern part of the building were built in 1735-1740 by Rafail Zaborovsky and according to architect Johann Schädel project. After the big fire in Kyiv in 1811 the building was reconstructed with the involvement of the architect A. Melensky. In 1860s open galleries were bricked up. Since the second half of the 19th-century library of Kyiv Theological Academy (the oldest college of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church) was placed here. After Academy being closed in 1919, Vernadsky Library's rare books collections were arranged in Old Academy Building and these collections were not conveyed to Kyiv-Mohyla academy after its revival in 1992. During World War II the site was slightly damaged (roof, decorations). In 1947, 1968, 1980 Old Academy building underwent renewal. In February 1992 the site came under the jurisdiction of National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy Library started gathering its holdings here. In 2017 the first stage of building long-planned restoration. Library and archives were relocated to other buildings.
Tetyana and Omelyan Antonovych Bachelor Library.
The current main University Library building was being built on the site of a historic 19th-century building which served as a hospital until the beginning of the 1990s. The interior of the building was being totally rebuilt and equipped with communication and energy systems. It is named in honor of its principal benefactors Tetiana and Omelian Antonovych, Ukrainian-born couple who immigrated to the United States, and who donated one million dollars to restoration. Another million dollars have come from donors in Ukraine, the United States and Canada. The library was opened on May 24, 2007. The library is home to the university's General Collection.
Viktor Kytasty American Library.
The American Library is named in memory of Victor Kytasty, who dedicated himself to the development and growth of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. It is a public library maintained as a department of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy Library. It was opened after the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine transferred the library from the America House to the campus of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in 1998. The library offers readers up-to-date English-language resources, books for kids and adults, free Internet access, and fun events like Friday night film showings. Address: 8/5 Voloska str., building 4 room #116.
Omeljan Pritsak Memorial Library.
In 2007, one of the leading Ukrainian universities, the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, received personal archive of Omeljan Pritsak, the first Professor of Ukrainian History at Harvard University and the founder and first director (1973-1989) of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute. The heritage, collected by Omeljan Pritsak for 70 years, contains manuscripts, printed editions, publications, historical sources, archival documents and artistic and cultural monuments on philosophy, linguistics, world history, Oriental Studies, Slavic Studies, Scandinavian Studies, archeology, numismatics etc. There are more than 20 thousand items, which are available through the electronic catalog.
In 2009, Omeljan Pritsak Research Center for Oriental Studies was established on the basis of this Memorial Library.
Other Libraries.
The other libraries located on the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy campus include Philological Library, located in the third Building, which houses volumes in the areas of philology, literature; Pre-university Studies Library, located in the Bursa Building; and Library in Center of Polish and European Studies, located in the 6th Building, which houses volumes in Polish.
Special collections.
There are 67 private collections donated by Ukrainian scholars mostly. Significant historical, cultural and scientific value brings the special Rare Books collection with more than 13, 000 items.
At the end of 2005, James Mace's library and archive were donated to the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy. Archive and library collection represents materials that describe Mace's life, academic activities and history of ukrainian studies in the USSR and abroad. Library collection counts over 1200 volumes of scientific works, periodicals, and other documents.

Sinyo Harry Sarundajang

Sinyo Harry Sarundajang (16 January 1945 – 13 February 2021) was an Indonesian politician. He served as governor of North Sulawesi for all but one month from 2005 to 2015. He was also a former Governor of North Maluku in 2002 and Maluku in 2002–2003. In February 2018, he was appointed by the President Joko Widodo as the ambassador to the Philippines, with concurrent accreditation to the Marshall Islands and Palau.
Personal life.
Early life.
Sarundajang was born in Kawangkoan, Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi on 16 January 1945. He is the firstling of three brothers of Youtje Sarundajang and Yulian Liow. He married Deetje Adeline Laoh Tambuwun on 17 June 1969, and they have 2 sons and three daughters named Ivan, Fabian, Vanda, Eva, and Shinta. Ivan Sarundajang served as the vice regent of Minahasa Regency from 2013 to 2018, Vanda Sarundajang is a member of the People's Representative Council from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, Fabian Sarundajang is a member of the Regional Representative Council, and Eva Sarundajang is member of People's Representative Council of North Sulawesi.
Education.
Sarundajang was educated in Sam Ratulangi University and earned the Baccalaureate of state administration in 1968, and he received the bachelor's degree at the 17 Agustus 1945 University, Jakarta in 1970. In 1972, he continued his studies at the Institut international d'administration publique, France, and earned the postgraduate degree in territorial administration. In 2011, he earned a doctorate from the Gadjah Mada University.
Career.
Mayor of Bitung.
Sarundajang became the mayor of the administrative city of Bitung in 1986. Unlike cities in Indonesia, administrative city do not have any city council and is not an autonomous territory. Sarundajang attempted to propose Bitung into an autonomous city, and his proposal was accepted in 1990. Bitung officially became a city on 10 October 1990, and Sarundajang was inaugurated as mayor on the same day. Sarundajang became the definitive mayor after he was elected in 1991 (assumed office on 7 December 1991) and again in 1996 (assumed office on 7 December 1996). Sarundajang ended his term after he handed over his office to city secretary Lexie Gobel on 10 April 2000. Sarundajang, who served as mayor for over fourteen years, became the third longest-serving mayor in Indonesia after Suryatati Abdul Manan (17 years) and Soedarisman Poerwokoesoemo (19 years).
Acting Governor of North Moluccas.
After ending his tenure in Bitung, Sarundajang was posted in Jakarta where he became the staff to the Minister of Internal Affairs. A year later, Sarundajang became the Inspector General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, replacing Andi Jalal Bachtiar. Sarundajang's tenure as inspector general was short lived as Sarundajang was sent to North Moluccas to became acting governor. His main task as acting governor was to pacify the region, which had been ridden with widespread religious violence between Muslims and Christians. Initially, most North Moluccans were cynical of his appointment and some were demanding his resignation from office.
The night after he arrived in North Maluku, a bomb exploded in the entrance of his hotel, just 25 meters away from his bed. In a 2004 interview, Sarundajang remarked that he did not fear the bomb, but the bomb made him realize the difficulties of his task of reconciliation. The next day, Sarundajang began his trip around North Moluccas, where he visited the houses of local community and religious leaders. Sarundajang shocked the leaders by entering their houses through the back door instead of the usual front door. In what he called as a show of good deed, Sarundajang drank a glass of water before conversing with the leaders each time he visited a house. 
Sarundajang's approach was lauded by the local Muslims and Christians. As a sign of respect, Muslims in the region gave him the title of "khalifa". After successfully negotiating with both sides, Sarundajang brought together both parties into a discussion. Both parties agreed to a reconciliation and a gubernatorial election was held shortly after. Thaib Armaiyn, a Muslim, was elected as the definitive governor and Sarundajang handed over his office to him on 29 September 2002.
Acting Governor of Moluccas.
Sarundajang's success in the reconciliation of North Moluccas had him appointed the acting Governor of Moluccas. Sarundajang assumed office on 11 December 2002 and was sent to the province several days after his inauguration in Jakarta. Similar to its northern counterpart, the Moluccas had experienced religious conflict between Christians and Muslims since 1999. The Moluccan populace was divided on Sarundajang's acting governorship, with Muslims in the region opposing him and Christians supporting him. Once again, Sarundajang was able to reconcile the province and successfully held gubernatorial election. Sarundajang was revered by Christians in the province as a "little angel". He handed over his office to Karel Albert Rahalalu, the elected Christian governor, under dramatically improved social and political conditions.
Governor of North Sulawesi.
First term.
Sarundajang ran as a candidate for the 2005 North Sulawesi gubernatorial election. His campaign team consisted of retired bureaucrats and military officers, including former Governor of North Sulawesi C. J. Rantung. Rantung himself recommended Golkar as Sarundajang's party in the elections. However, Golkar did not offer any endorsement to Sarundajang and he chose to run with the endorsement of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) instead. Sarundajang picked Freddy Harry Sualang, who at that time was PDIP's chairman in North Sulawesi, as his running mate. 
Although he was endorsed by PDIP, the party were largely uninvolved in campaigns. Sarundajang received most support from Golkar officials who were disappointed with the leadership of A. J. Sondakh, the incumbent governor who was also the chairman of Golkar in the province. Sarundajang's campaign team focused on his career as a "peacemaker" in North Moluccas and the Moluccas, with one of his campaign brochure emphasizing his title as a khalifah and "little angel". The election saw Sarundajang winning with 448,325 votes, or 39% of the total votes. His victory was seen as an end to the Golkar party's dominance in the area, in which Sondakh, the party's official candidate. only won 17% of the votes. Sarundajang assumed office on 13 August 2005.
In 2009, a corruption case involving inflated sales fund for Manado Beach Hotel came to surface. The acting mayor of Manado, Abdi Buchari, and Sarundajang's deputy, Freddy Sualang, was convicted of being involved in the corruption. The Minister of Internal Affairs deactivated both from their office after the two were brought into the court. To prevent vacancy, Sarundajang assumed office as the acting mayor on 11 August. Sarundajang's double office as both governor and acting mayor of the province's capital drew criticism from the Anti-Corruption Community Group, which stated that the office of acting mayor could only be held by active civil servants in the city. Sarundajang then appointed his regional secretary Robby Mamuaya to replace him as mayor.
Second term.
Sarundajang ran again for the governorship in the 2010 North Sulawesi gubernatorial elections, this time as a candidate from the Democratic Party. Sarundajang picked Djouhari Kansil as his running mate and he registered to the General Elections Commission on 27 May 2010 an hour before midnight. Sarundajang was declared eligible to ran in the elections on 17 June.
During his campaign, Sarundajang promoted the notion of a "Golden Triangle" in North Sulawesi's governance system. Sarundajang stated that he would ensure the representation of the three main ethnic groups in North Sulawesi (Minahasa, Nusa Utara, Totabuan) in his administration. While Sarundajang himself was of Minahasa origin, Sarundajang's running mate, Djouhari Kansil, was of Nusa Utara origin. Sarundajang also openly promoted Rachmat Mokodongan, a Totabuan, to seat the regional secretary post.
The election was held on 3 August 2010, alongside with three other mayoral election and a regent election in the province. Initial quick counts favoured Sarundajang and he was declared as the winner on 12 August. However, Sarundajang's opponent disputed the results of the elections to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, forcing Sarundajang's inauguration to be pushed back. Sarundajang briefly transferred his office to his regional secretary after his first term expired on 13 August 2010. The constitutional court refused to investigate the disputes filed by Sarundajang's opponent and Sarundajang was inaugurated for his second term on 14 September. 
Ambassador of Indonesia to the Philippines, Marshall Islands, and Palau.
Sarundajang was sworn in as the Ambassador of Indonesia to the Philippines, Marshall Islands, and Palau, along with 16 other ambassadors, on 20 February 2018. He presented his credentials to President Rodrigo Duterte on 28 May.
In September 2017, three Indonesians were taken hostage by Abu Sayyaf, a Jihadist militant and pirate group. According to Sarundajang, the Indonesian government were uninvolved in the negotiations to free the hostage. The three Indonesians were freed by the Philippine government on 15 September 2019, and were handed back to Sarundajang as the representative of government a day later. Sarundajang stated that the citizens were in good health but physically distressed.
Death.
Sarundajang died at 00.31 on 13 February 2021 in Siloam Hospital, Jakarta, twenty eight days after his 76th birthday. According to his daughter, Sarundajang had suffered complications several days before his death. He was planned to be buried at his hometown in Kawangkoan, Minahasa.

Siege of Kalmar

The Siege of Kalmar occurred in 1611 during the Kalmar War and constituted the major part of an intensive conflict between Denmark-Norway and Sweden for control of the strategically important city of Kalmar and its castle. For centuries, Kalmar was, from a strategic point of view, considered 'to be the key to Sweden'. The country that was in charge of the city with its fortified castle would reign over the Kalmar Strait and have free access to the north, along the Swedish east coast towards Stockholm. From this southern fulcrum in Sweden, a land-based attack against Danish territory and a naval attack with the Swedish navy could have been made possible.
The battle of Kalmar occurred during the summer in the same year.

Vitovnica Monastery

The Vitovnica Monastery () is a Serbian Orthodox monastery which is dedicated to the Assumption of the Holy Virgin.
The monastery is located in the hills of Eastern Serbia, on the right bank of Vitovnica River, some ten kilometres east of the town of Petrovac na Mlavi (Petrovac on the Mlava) and about 120 kilometres south-east of the capital, Belgrade.
The Foundation of Vitovnica.
The monastery was built by the Serbian king Stephen Milutin Nemanjić in 1291, after his victory over renegade noblemen Drman and Kudelin.
Drman and Kudelin had seized the region by force and turned it into an outlaw base from which they raided the neighbouring districts.
King Milutin founded Vitovnica as a token of gratitude for his victory over the enemy.
The Monastery in the Sixteenth Century.
From the sixteenth century onwards, Vitovnica is mentioned quite frequently both in the Serbian and Ottoman sources.
According to the Ottoman census of 1537, the monastery was inhabited by three monks and paying high taxes, a detail which suggests it was on a solid footing.
Vitovnica Gospel.
The famous Vitovnica Gospel also dates from the sixteenth century. It is a manuscript gospel produced in the monastery in the first half of the sixteenth century. We know for certain that it was bound in gilt silver in 1557. The binding was created by Vuk Kondo, renowned goldsmith of the era, who left a certificate of his craftsmanship on the upper side of the precious metalwork.
The Gospel is written in black ink, and the more important notes are emphasised in molten gold. The decorations and the initials are drawn in gold, blue, red, and green, while sentences are separated with a golden dot.
The front cover is decorated with twelve holy days, and the back cover depicts the Assumption of the Holy Virgin.
Vitovnica Gospel is now kept in the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, under the inventory number 355.
The Monastery in the Seventeenth Century.
The life of Vitovnica in the seventeenth century features in inscriptions in the monastery books, although some of these volumes perished in the flames which destroyed the National Library in Belgrade when it was bombed in World War Two.
One of the monastery books dating from before 1620 is preserved in Kiev library. It bears the following inscription: “This book was donated to Vitovnica Monastery by the hieromonk Nikephoros.”
After the Great Turkish War between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, in 1690 the monks removed the treasures of Vitovnica for safekeeping to the Serbian monastery of Bešenovo which lay across the Danube in Austria-Hungary.
Vitovnica Chalice.
The goblet known as Vitovnica Chalice dates from this period. It was made in silver in 1652.
The faces and the halos of saints depicted on it are gold plated.
It is now kept in the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade.
The Monastery in the Eighteenth Century.
When the inventory of the Bešenovo monastery was taken in 1753, the property of Vitovnica was still registered separately.
Vitovnica’s treasures remained in Bešenovo until World War Two, when Bešenovo was robbed and torched by the Ustashis, the forces of the Croatian fascist state.
The Monastery in the Nineteenth Century - the Time of Restoration and Growth.
After Serbia was liberated from Turkish rule at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Vitovnica began its revival. The mid-nineteenth century marks a significant rise in monastery’s fortunes. The hegumenos (abbot) Stefan Bojović is still remembered as symbolising Vitovnica’s restoration in this period.
It seems that the entire monastery complex was rebuilt by around 1856.
The monastery had prospered so much that it was able to build a primary school in the village of Vitovnica at its own expense in 1861.
Hegumenos Methodius.
Methodius Milovanović was the hegumenos (abbot) of Vitovnica between 1896 and 1902.
As well as being the leader of the monastery he was also the founder of the Serbian Beekeeping Society in 1897, and the founder of the Beekeeper journal which continues to be published to this day. He was the journal’s leading theorist and polemicist, and made a considerable contribution to the development of beekeeping in Serbia
The First Half of the Twentieth Century – Vitovnica Catastrophe.
Vitovnica’s progress was halted by historical circumstances in the first half of the twentieth century.
During World War One, between 1915 and 1918, the part of Serbia in which the monastery is situated found itself in the Bulgarian zone of occupation. In 1915, the Bulgarians took Isaiah Bogdanović, the then hegumenos (abbot) of Vitovnica, to a prison camp and killed him.
Bulgarian soldiers then plundered Vitovnica. The entire archival collection was destroyed.
The monastery had no time to recover from its sufferings under Bulgarian occupation before it was hit by new waves of suffering, first under German occupation in World War Two, and then under the communist rule.
In 1943, because of an attack against a German patrol which took place in the vicinity of Vitovnica, German commanders decided to torch the monastery. All of its buildings perished in flames, except for the church itself, the bell tower of which was partly burned.
All the dormitories and all the auxiliary buildings of the monastery complex, everything that had been rebuilt painstakingly and with great hardship throughout the nineteenth century, was destroyed.
The brotherhood saved their own lives by hiding in the surrounding woods. Nonetheless, the Germans managed to capture the hierodeacon Avakum Momčilovic who was taken to the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and killed.
When the local communists came to power in 1945, they killed the remaining monks and seized the monastery property. Among the monks killed by the communist villagers of Vitovnica was the hegumanos (abbot) Mardarius Zdravković. Hieromonk Sava Marković was thirty three when he was killed.
The post-war period thus saw a monastery deprived of both its buildings and its fraternity of monks.
The Second Half of the Twentieth Century - Painstaking Restoration.
Hieromonk Chrisostomos was sent to the deserted and torched ruins of the monastery by the church authorities in 1946. In exceptionally difficult circumstances, without a roof over his head, Chrisostomos began to rebuild the monastery. He can be credited with Vitovnica’s very survival in these hardest of times.
In spite of the enormity of its suffering in the first half of the twentieth century the monastery saw renewed progress because of the great efforts of its monks. It is now partly restored and the process is ongoing.
Saint Thaddeus of Vitovnica.
Saint Thaddeus was for many years the hegumanos (abbot) of Vitovnica monastery.
Saint Thaddeus of Vitovnica was born on 6 October 1914 in the village of Vitovnica, close to the monastery.
He took holy orders in 1935.
He became the hegumanos (abbot) of Vitovnica in 1962.
He died in 2003.
The faithful recognise him as a contemporary saint, and his tomb in Vitovnica attracts a large number of visitors.

Deepfake

Deepfakes (a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake") are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. While the act of faking content is not new, deepfakes leverage powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive. The main machine learning methods used to create deepfakes are based on deep learning and involve training generative neural network architectures, such as autoencoders or generative adversarial networks (GANs).
Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their uses in celebrity pornographic videos, revenge porn, fake news, hoaxes, and financial fraud. This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use.
History.
Photo manipulation was developed in the 19th century and soon applied to motion pictures. Technology steadily improved during the 20th century, and more quickly with digital video.
Deepfake technology has been developed by researchers at academic institutions beginning in the 1990s, and later by amateurs in online communities. More recently the methods have been adopted by industry.
Academic research.
Academic research related to deepfakes lies predominantly within the field of computer vision, a subfield of computer science. An early landmark project was the Video Rewrite program, published in 1997, which modified existing video footage of a person speaking to depict that person mouthing the words contained in a different audio track. It was the first system to fully automate this kind of facial reanimation, and it did so using machine learning techniques to make connections between the sounds produced by a video's subject and the shape of the subject's face.
Contemporary academic projects have focused on creating more realistic videos and on improving techniques. The "Synthesizing Obama" program, published in 2017, modifies video footage of former president Barack Obama to depict him mouthing the words contained in a separate audio track. The project lists as a main research contribution its photorealistic technique for synthesizing mouth shapes from audio. The Face2Face program, published in 2016, modifies video footage of a person's face to depict them mimicking the facial expressions of another person in real time. The project lists as a main research contribution the first method for re-enacting facial expressions in real time using a camera that does not capture depth, making it possible for the technique to be performed using common consumer cameras.
In August 2018, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley published a paper introducing a fake dancing app that can create the impression of masterful dancing ability using AI. This project expands the application of deepfakes to the entire body; previous works focused on the head or parts of the face.
Researchers have also shown that deepfakes are expanding into other domains such as tampering medical imagery. In this work, it was shown how an attacker can automatically inject or remove lung cancer in a patient's 3D CT scan. The result was so convincing that it fooled three radiologists and a state-of-the-art lung cancer detection AI. To demonstrate the threat, the authors successfully performed the attack on a hospital in a White hat penetration test.
A survey of deepfakes, published in May 2020, provides a timeline of how the creation and detection deepfakes have advanced over the last few years. The survey identifies that researchers have been focusing on resolving the following challenges of deepfake creation:
Overall, deepfakes are expected to have several implications in media and society, media production, media representations, media audiences, gender, law, and regulation, and politics.
Amateur development.
The term deepfakes originated around the end of 2017 from a Reddit user named "deepfakes". He, as well as others in the Reddit community r/deepfakes, shared deepfakes they created; many videos involved celebrities’ faces swapped onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos, while non-pornographic content included many videos with actor Nicolas Cage’s face swapped into various movies.
Other online communities remain, including Reddit communities that do not share pornography, such as r/SFWdeepfakes (short for "safe for work deepfakes"), in which community members share deepfakes depicting celebrities, politicians, and others in non-pornographic scenarios. Other online communities continue to share pornography on platforms that have not banned deepfake pornography.
Commercial development.
In January 2018, a proprietary desktop application called FakeApp was launched. This app allows users to easily create and share videos with their faces swapped with each other. As of 2019, FakeApp has been superseded by open-source alternatives such as Faceswap, command line-based DeepFaceLab, and web-based apps such as DeepfakesWeb.com 
Larger companies are also starting to use deepfakes. The mobile app giant Momo created the application Zao which allows users to superimpose their face on television and movie clips with a single picture. The Japanese AI company DataGrid made a full body deepfake that can create a person from scratch. They intend to use these for fashion and apparel.
Audio deepfakes, and AI software capable of detecting deepfakes and cloning human voices after 5 seconds of listening time also exist.
A mobile deepfake app, Impressions, was launched in March 2020. It was the first app for the creation of celebrity deepfake videos from mobile phones.
Resurrection.
Deepfakes technology can not only be used to fabricate messages and actions of others, but it can also be used to revive deceased individuals. On 29 October 2020, Kim Kardashian posted a video of her late father Robert Kardashian; the face in the video of Robert Kardashian was created with deepfake technogy. This hologram was created by the company Kaleida, where they use a combination of performance, motion tracking, SFX, VFX and DeepFake technologies in their hologram creation.
There was also an instance where Joaquin Oliver, victim of the Parkland shooting was resurrected with deepfake technology. Oliver's parents teamed up on behalf of their organization Nonprofit Change the Ref, with McCann Health to produce this deepfake video advocating for gun-safety voting campaign. In this deepfake message, it shows Joaquin encouraging viewers to vote.
Techniques.
Deepfakes rely on a type of neural network called an autoencoder. These consist of an encoder, which reduces an image to a lower dimensional latent space, and a decoder, which reconstructs the image from the latent representation. Deepfakes utilize this architecture by having a universal encoder which encodes a person in to the latent space. The latent representation contains key features about their facial features and body posture. This can then be decoded with a model trained specifically for the target. This means the target's detailed information will be superimposed on the underlying facial and body features of the original video, represented in the latent space.
A popular upgrade to this architecture attaches a generative adversarial network to the decoder. A GAN trains a generator, in this case the decoder, and a discriminator in an adversarial relationship. The generator creates new images from the latent representation of the source material, while the discriminator attempts to determine whether or not the image is generated. This causes the generator to create images that mimic reality extremely well as any defects would be caught by the discriminator. Both algorithms improve constantly in a zero sum game. This makes deepfakes difficult to combat as they are constantly evolving; any time a defect is determined, it can be corrected.
Applications.
Blackmail.
Deepfakes can be used to generate blackmail materials that falsely incriminate a victim. However, since the fakes cannot reliably be distinguished from genuine materials, victims of actual blackmail can now claim that the true artifacts are fakes, granting them plausible deniability. The effect is to void credibility of existing blackmail materials, which erases loyalty to blackmailers and destroys the blackmailer's control. This phenomenon can be termed "blackmail inflation", since it "devalues" real blackmail, rendering it worthless. It is possible to repurpose commodity cryptocurrency mining hardware with a small software program to generate this blackmail content for any number of subjects in huge quantities, driving up the supply of fake blackmail content limitlessly and in highly scalable fashion.
A report by the American Congressional Research Service warned that deepfakes could be used to blackmail elected officials or those with access to classified information for espionage or influence purposes.
Pornography.
Many deepfakes on the internet feature pornography of people, often female celebrities whose likeness is typically used without their consent. Deepfake pornography prominently surfaced on the Internet in 2017, particularly on Reddit. A report published in October 2019 by Dutch cybersecurity startup Deeptrace estimated that 96% of all deepfakes online were pornographic. 
The first one that captured attention was the Daisy Ridley deepfake, which was featured in several articles. Other prominent pornographic deepfakes were of various other celebrities. As of October 2019, most of the deepfake subjects on the internet were British and American actresses. However, around a quarter of the subjects are South Korean, the majority of which are K-pop stars. Another emerging concern is that deepfakes are being used for producing child pornography (virtual child sexual abuse material). 
In June 2019, a downloadable Windows and Linux application called DeepNude was released which used neural networks, specifically generative adversarial networks, to remove clothing from images of women. The app had both a paid and unpaid version, the paid version costing $50. On 27 June the creators removed the application and refunded consumers.
Politics.
Deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well-known politicians in videos.
In June 2019, the United States House Intelligence Committee held hearings on the potential malicious use of deepfakes to sway elections.
Art.
In March 2018 the multidisciplinary artist Joseph Ayerle published the videoartwork "Un'emozione per sempre 2.0" (English title: "The Italian Game"). The artist worked with Deepfake technology to create an "AI actress", a synthetic version of 80s movie star Ornella Muti, traveling in time from 1978 to 2018. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology referred this artwork in the study "Creative Wisdom". The artist used Ornella Muti's time travel to explore generational reflections, while also investigating questions about the role of provocation in the world of art. For the technical realization Ayerle used scenes of photo model Kendall Jenner. The program replaced Jenner's face by an AI calculated face of Ornella Muti. As a result, the AI actress has the face of the Italian actress Ornella Muti and the body of Kendall Jenner.
Acting.
There has been speculation about deepfakes being used for creating digital actors for future films. Digitally constructed/altered humans have already been used in films before, and deepfakes could contribute new developments in the near future. Deepfake technology has already been used by fans to insert faces into existing films, such as the insertion of Harrison Ford's young face onto Han Solo's face in "", and techniques similar to those used by deepfakes were used for the acting of Princess Leia in "Rogue One."
As deepfake technology increasingly advances, Disney has improved their visual effects using high resolution deepfake face swapping technology. Disney improved their technology through progressive training programmed to identify facial expressions, implementing a face swapping feature, and iterating in order to stabilize and refine the output. This high resolution deepfake technology will be implemented into movie and television production—saving significant operational and production costs. Disney's deepfake generation model can produce AI-generated media at a 1024 x 1024 resolution, which is much greater and produces more realistic results than common models that produce media at a 256 x 256 resolution. In addition, with this technology, Disney has the opportunity to revive dead actors and characters with a quick and simple face swap; Disney can now resurrect and revive characters for fans to enjoy.
Internet meme.
In 2020, an internet meme emerged utilizing deepfakes to generate videos of people singing the chorus of , a song from the game "Yakuza 0" in the video game series "Yakuza". In the series, the melancholic song is sung by the player in a karaoke minigame. Most iterations of this meme use a 2017 video uploaded by user Dobbsyrules, who lip syncs the song, as a template.
Social media.
Deepfakes have begun to see use in popular social media platforms, notably through Zao, a Chinese deepfake app that allows users to substitute their own faces onto those of characters in scenes from films and television shows such as "Romeo + Juliet" and "Game of Thrones". The app originally faced scrutiny over its invasive user data and privacy policy, after which the company put out a statement claiming it would revise the policy. In January 2020 Facebook announced that it was introducing new measures to counter this on its platforms.
The Congressional Research Service cited unspecified evidence as showing that foreign intelligence operatives used deepfakes to create social media accounts with the purposes of recruiting individuals with access to classified information.
Sockpuppets.
Deepfake photographs can be used to create sockpuppets, non-existent persons, who are active both online and in traditional media. A deepfake photograph appears to have been generated together with a legend for an apparently non-existent person named Oliver Taylor, whose identity was described as a university student in the United Kingdom. The Oliver Taylor persona submitted opinion pieces in several newspapers and was active in online media attacking a British legal academic and his wife, as "terrorist symphathizers." The academic had drawn international attention in 2018 when he commenced a lawsuit in Israel against NSO, a surveillance company, on behalf of people in Mexico who alleged they were victims of NSO's phone hacking technology. Reuters could find only scant records for Oliver Taylor and "his" university had no records for him. Many experts agreed that "his" photo is a deepfake. Several newspapers have not retracted "his" articles or removed them from their websites. It is feared that such techniques are a new battleground in disinformation.
Collections of deepfake photographs of non-existent people on social networks have also been deployed as part of Israeli partisan propaganda. The Facebook page "Zionist Spring" featured photos of non-existent persons along with their "testimonies" purporting to explain why they have abandoned their left-leaning politics to embrace the right-wing, and the page also contained large numbers of posts from Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu and his son and from other Israeli right wing sources. The photographs appear to have been generated by "human image synthesis" technology, computer software that takes data from photos of real people to produce a realistic composite image of a non-existent person. In much of the "testimony," the reason given for embracing the political right was the shock of learning of alleged incitement to violence against the prime minister. Right wing Israeli television broadcasters then broadcast the "testimony" of these non-existent person based on the fact that they were being "shared" online. The broadcasters aired the story, even though the broadcasters could not find such people, explaining "Why does the origin matter?" Other Facebook fake profiles—profiles of fictitious individuals—contained material that allegedly contained such incitement against the right wing prime minister, in response to which the prime minister complained that there was a plot to murder him.
Concerns.
Fraud.
Audio deepfakes have been used as part of social engineering scams, fooling people into thinking they are receiving instructions from a trusted individual. In 2019, a U.K.-based energy firm's CEO was scammed over the phone when he was ordered to transfer €220,000 into a Hungarian bank account by an individual who used audio deepfake technology to impersonate the voice of the firm's parent company's chief executive.
Credibility and authenticity.
Though fake photos have long been plentiful, faking motion pictures has been more difficult, and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not. AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology, and that the problem is not a technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism. Deepfakes can be leveraged to defame, impersonate, and spread disinformation. The primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium's content corresponds to the truth.
Similarly, computer science associate professor Hao Li of the University of Southern California states that deepfakes created for malicious use, such as fake news, will be even more harmful if nothing is done to spread awareness of deepfake technology. Li predicted that genuine videos and deepfakes would become indistinguishable in as soon as half a year, as of October 2019, due to rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and computer graphics.
Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder, has called deepfakes an area of “societal concern”, and said that they will inevitably evolve to the point where they can be generated automatically, and an individual could use that technology to produce millions of deepfake videos.
The consequences of a deepfake are not significant enough to destabilize the entire government system; however, deepfakes possess the ability to damage individual entities tremendously. This is because deepfakes are often targeted at one individual, and/or their relations to others in hopes to create a narrative powerful enough to influence public opinion or beliefs. This can be done through deepfake voice phishing, which manipulates audio to create fake phone calls or conversations. Another method of deepfake use is fabricated private remarks, which manipulate media to convey individuals voicing damaging comments.
In September 2020 Microsoft made public that they are developing a Deepfake detection software tool.
Example events.
Deepfakes of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian president Vladimir Putin have also been created by a nonpartisan advocacy group RepresentUs. These deepfakes were meant to air publicly as commercials to relay the notion that interference by these leaders in US elections would be detrimental to the United States' democracy; the commercial also aimed to shock Americans to realize how fragile democracy is, and how media and news can significantly influence the country's path regardless of credibility. However, these commercials did include an ending comment detailing that the footage was not real, and the commercials ultimately did not air due to fears and sensitivity regarding how Americans may react.
A clip from Nancy Pelosi's speech at the Center for American Progress given on 22 May 2019 was slowed down, in addition to the pitch being altered, to make it seem as if she were drunk; however, critics argue that this is not a deepfake.
Donald Trump deepfake.
A deepfake of Donald Trump was easily created based on a skit Jimmy Fallon performed on NBC's The Tonight Show. In this skit (aired 4 May 2016), Jimmy Fallon dressed up as Donald Trump and pretended to participate in a phone call with Barack Obama, conversing in a manner that presented him to be bragging about his primary win in Indiana. On 5 May 2019 a deepfake of Donald Trump (taken from this skit) was created. In this deepfake, Jimmy Fallon's face was transformed into Donald Trump's face (audio remained the same). This deepfake video was uploaded to YouTube by the founder of Derpfakes with a comedic intent.
Barack Obama deepfake.
American actor Jordan Peele, BuzzFeed, and Monkeypaw Productions created and produced a deepfake of Barack Obama (uploaded to YouTube on 17 Apr 2018) that depicted Barack Obama cursing and calling Donald Trump names. In this deepfake Peele's voice and mouth was transformed and manipulated into Obama's voice and face. The intent for this video was to portray the dangerous consequences and power of deepfakes, and how deepfakes can make anyone say anything.
Positive implications.
Potential positive innovations have also emerged alongside the growing popularity and creation of deepfakes. For example, corporate training videos can be created using deepfaked avatars and their voices. An example of this is Synthesia, which uses deepfake technology with avatars to create personalized videos.
Responses.
Social media platforms.
Twitter.
Twitter is taking active measures to handle synthetic and manipulated media on their platform. In order to prevent disinformation from spreading, Twitter is placing a notice on tweets that contain manipulated media and/or deepfakes that signal to viewers that the media is manipulated. There will also be a warning that appears to users who plan on retweeting, liking, or engaging with the tweet. Twitter will also work to provide users a link next to the tweet containing manipulated or synthetic media that links to a Twitter Moment or credible news article on the related topic—as a debunking action. Twitter also has the ability to remove any tweets containing deepfakes or manipulated media that may pose a harm to users’ safety. In order to better improve Twitter's detection of deepfakes and manipulated media, Twitter has asked users who are interesting in partnering with them to work on deepfake detection solutions to fill out a form (that is due 27 November 2020).
Facebook.
Facebook has taken efforts towards encouraging the creation of deepfakes in order to develop state of the art deepfake detection software. Facebook was the prominent partner in hosting the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC), held December 2019, to 2114 participants who generated more than 35000 models. The top performing models with the highest detection accuracy were analyzed for similarities and differences; these findings are areas of interest in further research to improve and refine deepfake detection models . Facebook has also detailed that the platform will be taking down media generated with artificial intelligence used to alter an individual's speech. However, media that has been edited to alter the order or context of words in one's message would remain on the site but be labeled as false, since it was not generated by artificial intelligence.
Detection.
Most of the academic research surrounding deepfake seeks to detect the videos. The most popular technique is to use algorithms similar to the ones used to build the deepfake to detect them. By recognizing patterns in how deepfakes are created the algorithm is able to pick up subtle inconsistencies. Researchers have developed automatic systems that examine videos for errors such as irregular blinking patterns of lighting. This technique has also been criticized for creating a "Moving Goal post" where anytime the algorithms for detecting get better, so do the deepfakes. The Deepfake Detection Challenge, hosted by a coalition of leading tech companies, hope to accelerate the technology for identifying manipulated content.
A team at the University of Buffalo published a paper in October 2020 outlining their technique of using reflections of light in the eyes of 
those depicted to spot deepfakes with a high rate of success, even without the use of an AI detection tool, at least for the time being.
Other techniques use blockchain to verify the source of the media. Videos will have to be verified through the ledger before they are shown on social media platforms. With this technology, only videos from trusted sources would be approved, decreasing the spread of possibly harmful deepfake media.
Digitally signing of all video and imagery by cameras and video cameras, including smartphone cameras, was suggested to fight deepfakes. That allows tracing every photograph or video back to its original owner that can be used to pursue dissidents.
Internet reaction.
Since 2017, Samantha Cole of Vice published a series of articles covering news surrounding deepfake pornography. On 31 January 2018, Gfycat began removing all deepfakes from its site. On Reddit, the r/deepfakes subreddit was banned on 7 February 2018, due to the policy violation of "involuntary pornography". In the same month, representatives from Twitter stated that they would suspend accounts suspected of posting non-consensual deepfake content. Chat site Discord has taken action against deepfakes in the past, and has taken a general stance against deepfakes. In September 2018, Google added "involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery” to its ban list, allowing anyone to request the block of results showing their fake nudes.
In February 2018, Pornhub said that it would ban deepfake videos on its website because it is considered “non consensual content” which violates their terms of service. They also stated previously to Mashable that they will take down content flagged as deepfakes. Writers from Motherboard from Buzzfeed News reported that searching "deepfakes" on Pornhub still returned multiple recent deepfake videos.
Facebook has previously stated that they would not remove deepfakes from their platforms. The videos will instead be flagged as fake by third-parties and then have a lessened priority in user's feeds. This response was prompted in June 2019 after a deepfake featuring a 2016 video of Mark Zuckerberg circulated on Facebook and Instagram.
Legal response.
In the United States, there have been some responses to the problems posed by deepfakes. In 2018, the Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act was introduced to the US Senate, and in 2019 the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act was introduced in the House of Representatives. Several states have also introduced legislation regarding deepfakes, including Virginia, Texas, California, and New York. On 3 October 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bills No. 602 and No. 730. Assembly Bill No. 602 provides individuals targeted by sexually explicit deepfake content made without their consent with a cause of action against the content's creator. Assembly Bill No. 730 prohibits the distribution of malicious deepfake audio or visual media targeting a candidate running for public office within 60 days of their election.
In November 2019 China announced that deepfakes and other synthetically faked footage should bear a clear notice about their fakeness starting in 2020. Failure to comply could be considered a crime the Cyberspace Administration of China stated on its website. The Chinese government seems to be reserving the right to prosecute both users and online video platforms failing to abide by the rules.
In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfake material can be prosecuted for harassment, but there are calls to make deepfake a specific crime; in the United States, where charges as varied as identity theft, cyberstalking, and revenge porn have been pursued, the notion of a more comprehensive statute has also been discussed.
In Canada, the Communications Security Establishment released a report which said that deepfakes could be used to interfere in Canadian politics, particularly to discredit politicians and influence voters. As a result, there are multiple ways for citizens in Canada to deal with deepfakes if they are targeted by them.
Response from DARPA.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded a project where individuals will compete to create AI-generated videos, audio, and images as well as automated tools to detect these deepfakes. DARPA has even taken efforts to host a "proposers day" for a project affiliated with the Semantic Forensics Program where researchers are driven to prevent viral spread of AI-manipulated media. DARPA and the Semantic Forensics Program are also working together to detect these AI-manipulated media through efforts focused in training computers to utilize common sense, logical reasoning. DARPA has also created a Media Forensics (MediFor) program, to mitigate the increasing harm that deepfakes and AI-generated media poses. This program aims to not only detect deepfakes, but also provide information regarding how the media was created. Simultaneously, DARPA's goal is to address and emphasize the consequential role of deepfakes and their influence upon decision making.

Olof Ljungström

Gustaf Olof "Olle" Ljungström (1918-2013) was a Swedish engineer. He was a visiting professor in aircraft design at Stanford University and the California Institute of Technology in the United States.
Biography.
Olof Ljungström was born in 1918 as the son of Fredrik Ljungström and Signe (née Söderberg). He studied at Whitlockska samskolan, and studied aeronautics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. He undertook military service as an automotive engineer in the Swedish Air Force in 1939 and 1940. He acquired a Ph.D. in transportation and aviation technology at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1973.
Ljungström made contributions as an engineer in both his family businesses, notably in shale oil extraction, and beyond. He was recruited for the aircraft development at Saab. As a technical engineer, he worked with models from Saab 17 and Saab 29 Tunnan to Saab 35 Draken, the latter which was originally due to employ the jet engine STAL Dovern. He also spearheaded the development of the hovercraft Saab 401 for the Swedish Navy during the 1960s.
Due to his wide knowledge in the field, he was appointed visiting professor in aircraft design at Stanford University 1966-1967 and the California Institute of Technology 1968, both in the United States.
Furthermore, Ljungström was an international pioneer in wind power. He initiated the governmental project of wind power in Sweden at Styrelsen för teknisk utveckling in 1974.
Ljungström has contributed as technical writer and editor in "Teknisk Tidskrift" (1960-1975), among other publications. Having worked close to his father Fredrik Ljungström, he wrote an extensive biography on him, "Fredrik Ljungström 1875-1964 - Uppfinnare och inspiratör", in 1999.

Whitlockska samskolan

Whitlockska samskolan was a Swedish private secondary school in Östermalm, Stockholm.
The school had its origin as a girls' school founded by the pedagogue and suffragette Anna Whitlock in 1878. In 1893, Whitlock and Ellen Key re-established the school as "Stockholms nya samskola" (New Co-educational School of Stockholm). The name Whitlockska samskolan was adopted in 1905.
At the time of its founding, the school had an innovative curriculum. In addition to it being one of the first co-educational secondary schools in Sweden, it had student councils and put an emphasis on science education for girls and social sciences for boys. The school did not have classes in Christianity, which at the time was a standard subject in Swedish schools, and adhered strictly to principles of freedom of religion.
The school was closed in 1978.

Airliner Number 4

Airliner Number 4 was a design by Norman Bel Geddes and Otto A. Koller for a 9-deck amphibious passenger aircraft intended to replace the large transatlantic liners that traveled between Europe and North America before the Second World War. It was never built.
Background.
Norman Bel Geddes was one of the first industrial designers in the United States, and is one of the pioneers of streamlining in design. He produced ambitious and futuristic projects in the 1930s for vehicles, flying cars, aircraft, and consumer goods—only some of which were realised. He was in the habit of giving his staff ambitious or unusual projects when they were between client commissions such as "Get a thousand luxury lovers from New York to Paris fast. Forget the limitations."
Design.
The aircraft was designed between 1929 and 1932 with the idea of showing "what the intercontinental air liner of 1940 will be like." Geddes developed the overall design concept while German aeronautical engineer Otto A. Koller provided the engineering expertise as Geddes was not a trained engineer. The two had clashed over Airplane Number 1 in January 1930, after Koller had described it as "an absolute[ly] undesirable design." Koller then declined to provide performance specifications for its replacement, Airliner Number 4, which Geddes intended to include for publicity purposes in his upcoming book "Horizons" (Little Brown, New York, 1932). Geddes devoted over ten pages of the book to the project, including a fulsome endorsement of Koller's skills as an aircraft engineer on page 111 and detailed cut-away plans of the aircraft. Although uncredited in "Horizons", the striking illustrations of the aircraft may have been drawn by the young C. Stowe Myers who had his first job in Geddes's office and was tasked with creating the illustrations for the book.
Designed as a V-shaped monoplane with nine decks, large capacity, viewing galleries, and public areas big enough to hold an orchestra, Geddes intended Airliner Number 4 to replace the ocean liner. He wrote that, "Passengers aboard this air liner are able to move about as freely as on an ocean liner, enjoying recreations and diversions similar to those which seagoing passengers are now accustomed." It would have had a wingspan of and a capacity of 451 passengers plus a crew of 155. Power in the design was provided by twenty engines with six in reserve. Each of the two pontoons that supported the plane on water would hold passengers, and also accommodate three lifeboats, sufficient for all persons on board. Two interior hangars would hold smaller aircraft.
It was not the first design to feature a giant wing. Le Corbusier's "Vers une architecture" (1931 edition) had included an illustration of the "airplane of to-morrow" that featured windows along the edge of the wing like Airliner Number 4, but, unlike it, had three tail fins and the engines mounted behind the wing, rather than above. Geddes described Airliner Number 4 as an "airship" in "Horizons" (p. 111) and compared his design with that of the largest aircraft so far built — as far as he was aware — the 48-meter wingspan Dornier Do X, which he said could carry 150 people, but not in comfort. The largest-dimensioned aircraft "actually" built anywhere during the 1930s, the Soviet Union's six/eight-engined, 63-meter wingspan Tupolev "Maksim Gorki", was not revealed until 1934.
Planned operations.
Geddes claimed in "Horizons" to have had interest in the project from Chicago businessmen and that in-air refueling over Newfoundland would let the plane make the trip from Chicago to London in 42 hours, rather than the single Atlantic crossing per week of the fastest ocean liners. He believed that the aircraft could be built and fitted out for $9 million, and that making three Atlantic crossings a week with ticket prices comparable to those charged by ocean liners, it would pay for itself in three years by contrast with the $60 million construction cost of a liner.
Airliner Number 4 would have been amphibious, but Geddes also included in "Horizons" plans for a floating airport near the shore of Manhattan Island, New York, and other airport designs for the time he foresaw when air travel would be as important as rail travel.
Alongside Airliner Number 4, Geddes was working on designs for a Streamlined Ocean Liner, which also featured in "Horizons", and for which he filed an outline patent in 1933 and a detailed patent in 1934. That design also was never built.
Publicity and legacy.
Airliner Number 4 received widespread publicity and featured in "The Detroit News" in January 1933, drawn by J. L. Kraemer alongside photographs of other Geddes designs.
Christopher Innes has written that the giant aircraft flown by the engineers and mechanics of Alexander Korda's 1936 film "Things to Come", based on the H. G. Wells novel "The Shape of Things to Come" (1933), resembles Geddes' designs in "Horizons". The starring role in the film was taken by Raymond Massey, who had acted in Geddes' production of "Hamlet". The design, or ideas circulating about large aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s, may also have influenced the design of Howard Hughes' huge 1947 Hughes H-4 Hercules "Spruce Goose", but this has not been confirmed. Bohn Aluminum featured an imaginary aircraft in the form of a giant wing in their advertising in 1947. In 2009, Airliner Number 4 was the subject of a 1/288 model kit by Fantastic Plastic.
Papers relating to Airliner Number 4 are held in the Norman Bel Geddes Collection of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life (first published in 2016) is the second book by blogger and author Mark Manson. In it Manson argues that life's struggles give it meaning, and that the mindless positivity of typical self-help books is neither practical nor helpful. It was a "New York Times" and "Globe and Mail" bestseller.
Publication history.
"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck" was published under the imprint of HarperOne, a division of HarperCollins Publishers, and was released on September 13, 2016.
As of May 2019, over 8 million copies of the book had been sold.
Contents.
The book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that is not practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been categorized by some as contrarian to the general self-help industry, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.
The book has nine chapters. The first chapter, "Don't Try", is named after the philosophy of Charles Bukowski, who served as a major inspiration for the whole book.
The chapters have the following titles:
1. Don't Try.
2. Happiness is a problem.
3. You are not special.
4. The value of suffering.
5. You are always choosing.
6. You are wrong about everything (But so am I).
7. Failure is the way forward.
8. The importance of saying no.
9. And then you die.
Summary.
"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck" is a book about finding meaning in important things in life and only having those values that an individual can control. Whatever value (such as popularity) that is not under a person's control, is a bad value to have and a person should strive to replace it with something more controllable such as punctuality, honesty, or kindness. Manson further advises avoiding claiming certainty about the knowledge that is out of one's grasp and not worry about leaving a legacy for the posterity. Instead of worrying about building a body of work as a legacy, one should seek to create joy in the moment for one's self and those around.
Reception.
"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck" first appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List at #6 for the category of How-to and Miscellaneous for the week of October 2, 2016. It reached #1 for the first time on July 16, 2017. As of the end of May 2020, the book has spent 179 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list.
The book also appeared on the Washington Post Bestseller List at #9 in the Non-fiction/General category for the week of September 25, 2016, and on the Toronto Star List at #1 in the Self-Improvement category on September 23, 2016. In 2017, it was the best-selling nonfiction book from Barnes &amp; Noble, the #4 best-selling book on all of Amazon.com, and the #9 best-selling book in Canada.
"Kirkus Reviews" said that the book was "[a] good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be measured."
The book was noted as a prominent instance of an industry wide trend of swear words in book titles during the 2010s.
Critics have been quick to note that the apparent lack of sophistication in language and style of the book is a clever disguise for more serious value-related content of the book.

Syrian Liberation Front–Tahrir al-Sham conflict

On 19 February 2018, heavy clashes erupted between the newly established Syrian Liberation Front, which consists of Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, backed by the Suqour al-Sham Brigades, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in the western Aleppo Governorate. The conflict soon spread to the Idlib Governorate and the SLF captured several towns from HTS. A ceasefire between the two groups was reached on 24 April 2018. Fighting again resumed on 1 January 2019, ending with a total HTS military victory on 9 January.
Background.
Tahrir al-Sham was formed by five Salafist rebel groups in Syria, including the al-Nusra Front and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, on 28 January 2017. During clashes between Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham, however, Nour al-Din al-Zenki refused to fight Ahrar al-Sham and defected from HTS. Violent clashes then erupted between Zenki and HTS in western Aleppo and northern Idlib between August and November 2017.
On 18 February 2018, Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement announced a merger which established the Syrian Liberation Front. According to Sam Heller of the International Crisis Group, the formation of the Syrian Liberation Front was an attempt by Ahrar al-Sham and the Zenki Movement to create a "counterweight" against the dominance of Tahrir al-Sham in northwestern Syria. HTS reportedly prepared to attack Zenki prior to the merger.
Tahrir al-Sham released a statement condemning Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement and calling them 'aggressors' and liars about their willingness to resolve inter-rebel disputes in a Sharia court as well as calling them traitors, the statement also said this is part of a long series of conflicts with the Zenki movement and listed several incidents of times the Zenki movement acted against Tahrir Al-Sham. Allegations included recruiting former Syrian Democratic Forces and YPG fighters to fight Tahrir al-Sham as well as attacks on bases belonging to Tahrir al-Sham. The statement also said that the Zenki movement planted IEDs and attempted to assassinate Tahrir Al-Sham members via this method, and that they are responsible for killing a Tahrir Al-Sham official named Abu Ayman Al-Masri after attacking a court house, a child, and a teacher from a religious college. The statement also said that the Zenki movement is being hypocritical regarding affairs in Idlib and the siege in East Ghouta by not sending fighters to Ghouta but rather deploying them to attack Tahrir al-Sham, they also condemned the Zenki movement for their support of de-escalation zones. Ahrar al-Sham also released a statement about their support for the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement and plans to expel Tahrir al-Sham from the area. The Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement denied the claims made by HTS such as assisting YPG fighters in fighting HTS, as well as the claims about killing HTS members, with the group's spokesman stating the deaths occurred as a result of mistaken identities and confusion over whom the individuals killed actually were.
Observers have said that the conflict is possibly being used by Turkey as an opportunity to expand influence over the area with groups aligned with Turkish interests in the area whilst liquidating hard-line groups such as HTS and Al-Qaeda.
Conflict.
First phase.
The conflict was triggered by the assassination of HTS commander Abu Ayman al-Masri on 16 February 2018, by Nour al-Din al-Zenki. The commander's wife was also wounded during the attack that killed him.
February.
On 19 February 2018, a day after the Syrian Liberation Front was established, clashes erupted between the SLF and HTS in western Aleppo and northern Idlib. By 21 February, the SLF, with support from Suqour al-Sham, captured the city of Maarrat al-Nu'man, the towns of Ariha and Tramla, and the Wadi Deif military base near Maarrat al-Nu'man following HTS withdrawal. Meanwhile, in western Aleppo, HTS captured the villages of Kafr Laha, Basratun, Uwayjil and Taqad from the SLF.
&lt;br&gt;
On social media, both groups accused each other of spreading fake news. HTS's official media outlet claimed on Telegram that "There are no problems between us and Ahrar al-Sham", and that Ahrar al-Sham fighters assisting the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement are "nothing more than individuals whose motivations are clear." This was said despite Ahrar al-Sham as a whole merging with the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement in forming the Syrian Liberation Front.
On 20 February the Syrian Liberation Front accused Tahrir al-Sham of capturing its members at checkpoints.
On 24 February, Hassan Soufan, general commander of the Syrian Liberation Front, called on the Sham Legion, who did not comment on the clashes, to side with the SLF against HTS.
During a brief battle on 26 February, mere hours after the loss of Darat Izza to the SLF, HTS reportedly captured the largest base of Ahrar al-Sham, Khirbet Bantanta Military Camp, located in northern Idlib province, thus securing a large stash of weaponry, including 20 tanks, towed artillery pieces, multiple rocket launchers, self-propelled guns and infantry fighting vehicles.
On 27 February, HTS withdrew from the city of Khan Shaykhun, and was expelled from western Aleppo, although it repelled the SLF advance on al-Dana. During the last day of February, HTS launched a large-scale counter-offensive, capturing settlements of Kafr Losen, Aqrabat, Deir Hassan, and Qah, as well as attacking the town of Atmeh.
HTS also handed over Morek to the Army of Glory and the SLF.
March.
On 1 March, HTS released between 150 and 180 ISIL fighters captured during the Northwestern Syria campaign (October 2017–February 2018) by the Army of Victory and the Army of Glory to help in the fight against the SLF. Tahrir al-Sham recaptured Reef al-Muhandisin in the Aleppo Governorate, and a weapons depot there exploded. Syrian Civil Defense reported that they recovered bodies of eight individuals, while the reports claim that 20 were killed and eight wounded in the explosion.
On 2 March, Tahrir al-Sham advanced to the outskirts of the SLF stronghold of Atarib with an estimated 1,500 fighters and 30 tanks, along with other vehicles. However, Tahrir al-Sham fighters retreated from their staging positions after dozens of civilians demonstrated against the attack on Atarib. The head of Atarib's local council stated that they have reached an agreement with Tahrir al-Sham, which stated that the group will not enter Atarib. Multiple factions operating in Atarib, including the Atarib Martyrs Brigade, the Sham Legion, and Ahrar al-Sham, formed a unified military formation named the Revolutionaries of Atarib, consisting of over a thousand of fighters. The new formation stated that its goal is to protect Atarib from any aggressor. In Idlib, Abdullah al-Muhaysini and Musallah al-Olayan announced the formation of the Aba Union for foreign jihadist fighters to remain focused on fighting the Syrian government and not get involved in the infighting while still remaining in their respective factions.
The newly formed al-Qaeda faction Guardians of Religion Organization, specifically, Jaysh al-Sahel, threatened to engage the SLF if they attack certain villages.
As Atarib was surrounded on all sides by HTS, HTS has also announced plans to take Darat Izza and the Aleppo suburbs by force. The next day, the SLF took control of three in northern Aleppo and northwest Idlib, near Afrin. Hussam Atrash the head of the SLF political bureau posted on Twitter threats of further violence against HTS. Several tribal forces are to be deployed to Idlib from Turkey after clan leaders in Urfa had a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the framework and development of a council. The tribal fighters are being sent to Idlib on an unspecified date to support the Turkish military operation in Afrin in an interview a representative from the tribal fighters was asked about the situation in Idlib to which he said "we were asked to be ready to go there (Idlib)" he added, "If there is an internal order to fight HTS, we will participate".
On 3 March, the SLF (specifically the Nour al-Din al-Zenki) took advantage of HTS forces being off-balance. Attacked west of Kafr Nabl, the SLF captured three towns along a road, further isolating HTS garrisons in southern Idlib governorate. A media channel linked to SLF and Suqour al-Sham claimed the killing of 3 HTS commanders in Jabal Zawiya.
On 4 March, HTS launched a large-scale counter-offensive in Idlib and Aleppo, reportedly recapturing 50 towns and villages. During the HTS counter offensive SLF destroyed 3 tanks and 1 BMP while damaging 2 tanks using TOW missiles. Tahrir al-Sham captured Taqad and Saadiyah villages in western Aleppo from SLF. SLF stated that they destroyed 6 tanks from Tahrir al-Sham during the past two days in Taqad and Saadiyah. Clashes between the two in Shamiku village reportedly killed three and wounded three civilians.
On 7 March, Tahrir al-Sham captured settlements of Kafr Naha, al-Sa’adiyah and A’jil from SLF in the Aleppo Governorate, as well as housing complexes of al-Arman, al-Fursan and al-Rahal.
On 8 March, reports emerged Tahrir al-Sham released 50 Jund al-Aqsa members.
On 11 March, fighting resumed and several SLF members surrendered to HTS.
On 17 March, Faylaq al-Sham mediated a ceasefire agreement between Tahrir al-Sham and the Syrian Liberation Front. The agreement includes release of prisoners on both sides, cessation of attacks, and opening of roads leading to the front lines with the Syrian Arab Army and its allies.
Second phase.
March.
On 19 March, two days after the cease fire agreement Ahrar al-Sham arrested a Tahrir al-Sham commander named Yusuf al-Abdullah as he was trying to flee areas under control of the Syrian Army in the Hama Governorate, he was reportedly trying to flee to Lebanon.
On 22 March, reports emerged that Tahrir al-Sham and SLF are expected to resume clashing soon, as the temporary ceasefire ended today as the parties were unable to successfully negotiate a truce. Suqour al-Sham blamed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's leader, Abu Muhammad al-Jolani for the cease fire falling apart because he refused the SLF's proposals and demanded that SLF hands over localities they captured from Tahrir al-Sham.
On 23 March, Tahrir al-Sham clashed with SLF in the western part of the Aleppo Governorate, 100 people gathered to demonstrate against Tahrir al-Sham in Atarib near the headquarters of Tahrir al-Sham and they opened fire on the demonstrators injuring one while they shelled the 46th regiment base. On the same day unknown gunmen stormed the headquarters of the Sham Legion in Idlib killing four of their members there is evidence that suggests that Jund al-Aqsa is behind the attack which has cells and remnants active in Tahrir al-Sham, Guardians of the Religion organization, the Turkistan Islamic Party, as well as a new group consisting of 300 former members of the group called Ansar al-Tawhid. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that after the military operation in Afrin is complete that his next goal is to take both Idlib and Manbij.
On 24 March, a car bomb detonated near a hospital in Idlib killing 7 and injuring 25 no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, several have accused Pro-Islamic State cells for the attack.

The Keewatin Lobe of the continental ice sheet, block the flow of water northward and impounded it along the ice front. Lakes formed, until the waters could find a new way to drain. Initially, the north flowing rivers followed the front of the glacier eastward and into a valley that passed between Garrison and Riverdale, to the Turtle Lake area, and on into Sheridan County. This is known as the preglacial McClean River. This valley became blocked by the glacier and the glacial lake identified as Lake McKenzie formed. Eventually, water level rose to crest the south ridge a point near Riverdale — at the site of the modern Garrison Dam and a diversion trench was cut. The modern Missouri River follows this pathway.

I Believe (DJ Khaled song)

"I Believe" is a song recorded by American record producer DJ Khaled, featuring guest vocals from American singer Demi Lovato. The artists co-wrote the song with Denisia Andrews and Brittany Coney, with production handled by Khaled. It was released by Epic Records on March 7, 2018, as the third single from the soundtrack to the 2018 film "A Wrinkle in Time". The song surrounds the message of believing in oneself.
Release and promotion.
Lovato first teased the song on February 20, 2018, writing on Twitter: "Ahhhh!! I'm so excited to finally tell you guys my new song ['I Believe'] with [DJ Khaled] will be on the soundtrack for Disney's [Wrinkle in Time]," along with a snippet. On March 6, 2018, a preview of the music video debuted on "Good Morning America".
Music video.
The song's music video was directed by Hannah Lux Davis. It features Khaled and Lovato singing in various green-screen landscapes, including a golden wheat field, a dark forest and a natural backdrop surrounded by lush grass and blue skies, intercut with movie scenes. Lovato dresses up in a red gown, while Khaled wears a tracksuit.
Critical reception.
Elias Leight of "Rolling Stone" deemed the song "a meeting of maximalists" with "Lovato singing with her usual boisterous enthusiasm" and Khaled "offering a series of self-help maxims". Aaron Williams of "Uproxx" regarded the song as "a full-on display of Demi Lovato's vocal chops". Devin Ch of HotNewHipHop opined that the song "mostly caters to urban-pop playlists", writing that its message is "accessible on all fronts".

Vatusila

Vatusila is a genus of land snail found in Oceania. It consists of five extant and one fossil species. Alan Solem described and named the genus in 1983. 
Taxonomic history.
The genus was circumscribed by the American malacologist Alan Solem in a 1983 monograph. He placed it in the subfamily Charopinae. Solem included six species in his original circumscription: "V. eniwetokensis", "V. kondoi", "V. nayauana", "V. niueana", "V. tongensis", and "V. vaitupuensis". Solem designated "V. tongensis" to be the genus's type species. The fossil species "V. eniwetokensis" was first described in 1958 by the American paleontologist Harry S. Ladd, who placed it in the genus "Ptychodon"; Solem described the five other extant species in his 1983 monograph.
The generic name "Vatusila" comes from a Fijian tribe of the same name which were located in the headwaters of the Sigatoka River on the island of Viti Levu. They are known for the 1867 murder and cannibalism of the missionary Thomas Baker. A review of Solem's monograph published in "Systematic Biology" noted his propensity for "creative generic nomenclature" which "may either lighten the reader's day or engender hostility" and alluded to this genus as one of its examples.
Description.
Solem notes that "Vatusila" species can have "rather widely different appearance of the sculpture and large size range". Their shells have 3½–5 whorls which can be coiled anywhere from rather tightly to normally. Their apical sculpture consists of 8–12 prominent, fine spiral chords. Their shells have a rounded lip.
Geographic and temporal range.
"Vatusila" species are found in various islands in the South Pacific. "V. kondoi" and "V. nayauana" are both found on Nayau, in the Lau Islands, Fiji. "V. niueana" is found on Niue. "V. tongensis" is found on ʻEua, Tonga. "V. vaitupuensis" is found on Vaitupu, Tuvalu. "V. eniwetokensis" was found on Enewetak, Marshall Islands. 
The holotype and only specimen of "V. eniwetokensis" dates to the Upper Miocene.
Conservation and threats.
"V. nayauana" and "V. kondoi" are both critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List. They both live in forests on Nayau and their habitat is affected by increased wood harvesting. Rats, chickens, and pigs are predators of snails.
The IUCN also notes that the giant African snail, the rosy wolf snail, and the New Guinea flatworm, while not yet in Fiji, have become invasive throughout much of the Pacific and would have deleterious effects on the local land snail fauna. There is also concern about indigenous snail species being affected by invasive ant species; at least 9 have become established in the Lau Islands, including tramp species such as "Anoplolepis gracilipes".

Burbuleia gens

The gens Burbuleia, occasionally written "Burboleia", was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are mentioned in the time of Cicero, but the only one who achieved any distinction in the Roman state was Lucius Burbuleius Optatus, consul in AD 135.
Origin.
The nomen "Burbuleius" belongs to a large class of gentilicia ending in "-eius", typically formed from Oscan names originally ending in "-as". However, as the number of such gentile names grew, "-eius" came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was applied in cases where it had no morphological justification, so it cannot be determined whether the root of "Burbuleius" is Oscan, or perhaps a Latin cognomen, like "Burbulus". There was a family of this name from Minturnae, in southern Latium, which would be consistent with either a Latin or Oscan origin. Minturnae was originally a town of the Ausones, which received a Roman colony in 296 BC.
Branches and cognomina.
The only distinct family of the Burbuleii bore the surname "Optatus", desired or welcome. The consul Optatus had the additional surname "Ligarianus", which in Republican times would normally have indicated adoption from the Ligarian gens, but by the second century such nomenclature usually indicates descent from a family through the female line. "Secunda", borne by Burbuleia, the wife of Cornelius Hilarus, was a personal or individualizing surname, derived from the old Latin praenomen "Secunda", originally given to a second daughter.

The Stegeholm is a Swedish sightseeing motor launch that was built in 1950 as the Queen Mary, and has also been known as the Stella-Fors, Forsman 9, Bellman 4 and Wasaholm 2. Given her current name in 1988, she now operates sightseeing trips for the Strömma Kanalbolaget. Built in mahogany, she is one of the last open wooden sightseeing boats operating in Stockholm, and is a listed historic ship of Sweden.
History.
"Queen Mary" was built by the Rosättra Båtvarv in Norrtälje and delivered in 1950 to Bertil Sjöberg for use on sightseeing boat services in Stockholm. In 1960 she was sold to Forsmans Trafik &amp; Taxibåtar and renamed "Stella-Fors". In 1964 she was transferred to Forsman Sightseeing AB and renamed "Forsman 9". In 1984 she was sold to Tourist Sightseeing AB and renamed "Bellman 4". The following year she was sold to Bröderna Rais Skärgårdsturer and renamed "Wasaholm 2", before being renamed "Stegeholm" in 1988. In 1992 she was bought by Ångfartygs AB Strömma Kanal, better known as Strömma Kanalbolaget.
Despite the changes in name and ownership, the "Stegeholm" continued to operate similar services. In 2010, she initiated a new hop-on, hop-off sightseeing service on the Brunnsviken, a lake in Stockholm that is surrounded by parks and interesting buildings, most notably the Haga Park and Haga Palace.

Lake Circle

Lake Circle was a glacial lake that formed during the late Pleistocene epoch along the Redwater River in eastern Montana. After the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, glacial ice melt accumulated in the basin surrounded by the ridges of the preglacial valley and the retreating glacier. 
Southwest of Nickwall are the remnants of a broad abandoned valley with long side slopes. The valley runs north from Redwater Creek to the Missouri River. The bottom is poorly drained and about in width. It lies above the sea level and above the Missouri River bottomland. The upland slopes are extensive, clear and flat. The valleys surrounding it are dissected with V-shaped coulees. The difference between the Redwater valley and those around it reflect stream erosion vs. lake sedimentation. The drift in the valleys, appears to be as left by the glacier in the previously created valleys. Using the dating of lake deposits near Great Falls, Montana, the Havre lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet dammed the ancestral Missouri River during the late Wisconsin Glacial Period.
Glacial Event.
A lobe of the late Wisconsin Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced from central Alberta, southeastward into Montana and southwestern Saskatchewan. It left the Cypress Hills and Boundary Plateau undisturbed. As the glacier crossed the present day Milk River valley in southern Alberta, it was split into two lobes by the Sweetgrass Hills, which became an island in the glacier. The western lobe or Shelby lobe, moved southward to the Missouri River, near Great Falls, Montana. The Havre lobe, east of the Sweetgrass Hills, moved in two directions. The Lorna sublobe, advanced over the Missouri River to north of the Highwood Mountains. The Malta sublobe expanded southeastward along the present-day Milk River, between the Boundary Plateau and the Little Rocky Mountains in the region of the Musselshell River.

Flower of the Universe

"Flower of the Universe" is a song recorded by the British singer Sade Adu for the soundtrack to the 2018 film "A Wrinkle in Time". Written and produced by Sade, Andrew Hale and Ben Travers, it was released as the lead single from the soundtrack, serving as Sade's first song in seven years. The song starts at No. 25 on "R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales" with 6,000 sold in the week ending March 15, 2018.
Background.
The film's director Ava DuVernay revealed the song in a tweet on 20 February 2018, alongside a GIF of Sade. "I never thought she'd say yes, but asked anyway. She was kind plus giving. A goddess. We began a journey together that I'll never forget. Proud to announce that Sade has created an original song for Wrinkle in Time. It's entitled 'Flower of the Universe.' And it's a dream come true."
Reception.
Jordan Sargent of "Spin" commented "Flower of the Universe" feels of a piece with "Soldier of Love"—the band’s most recent album, released in 2010—which sucked the grooves out of their sound in favor of a stillness that conveyed both the vulnerability and strength inherent in isolation. Likewise, there are no drums present on “Flower of the Universe”—instead, the song’s arrangement (written in tandem with bandmate Andrew Hale and another collaborator, Ben Travers) is constructed only from the strums of an acoustic guitar and cooed backing harmonies that seem to stretch far and wide. The song—about a mother’s eternal love—suggests that Sade is out somewhere in the wilderness, detached from the rest of humanity. It invites repeated listens and eventually envelops you, offering a calming, nourishing comfort. Andrew Flanagan of "NPR" stated "The track is classic Sade — a lush, honey sway, a voice like thick, slow-motion silk." Ben Baumont-Thomas of "The Guardian" noted "Backed by pretty acoustic guitar and almost eerie wordless backing vocals, Sade delivers a typically spellbinding vocal line. The sentimental lyric is aimed at a child, described as a "flower of the universe".

Spanish ship Fama

Fama was a fifth-rate frigate in service with the Spanish and British Royal Navies.
History.
Fama was laid down as a 34-gun fifth-rate frigate in Cartagena in 1795, and was launched later that year. In 1796 she was assigned to the Spanish Philippines, and so she departed Concepcion, Chile for Manila on 10 October 1796 in the company of the third-rates "Europa", "Montañes", "San Pedro", and the frigate "Pilar." In Manila a typhoon severely damaged the squadron, putting it out of action for nearly two years. At the same time, the Anglo-Spanish War broke out between Great Britain and Spain. After repairs were completed, Admiral Ignacio Maria de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete attempted to use the fleet to disrupt the British trade with China by sailing the squadron into the South China Sea in search of a British convoy. After fighting an inconclusive battle with a British fleet in January 1797, de Navarrete ordered "Fama" and "Europa" to Macau in an attempt to intercept British merchantmen in the Pearl River estuary. This operation was likewise a failure, and both ships returned to Manila.
In 1804 "Fama" and three other Spanish frigates departed Montevideo for Spain laden silver and gold destined for France. Though Britain and Spain were not at war, the Royal Navy intercepted the Spanish force with the intent to stop its valuable cargo from reaching France. In the ensuing Battle of Cape Santa Maria, a force of 4 British frigates attacked the Spanish frigates. "Fama" struck her colors in surrender soon after the battle started, but later attempted to flee. She was caught by the faster HMS "Medusa" and HMS "Lively" several hours later and forced to surrender a second time.
Following her capture, "Fama" was inducted into the Royal Navy as HMS "Fama." She was sold in 1812"."

Sepia hierredda

Sepia hierredda, the giant African cuttlefish, is a species of cuttlefish from the family Sepiidae, which was previously considered conspecific with the common cuttlefish "Sepia officinalis". It is found along the western coast of Africa and is an important species to fisheries.
Description.
"Sepia hierredda" is very similar to the common cuttlefish but there are a number of consistent morphological differences which can be used to identify "S. hieredda" from "S. officinalis", the two species being sympatric off northwestern Africa. The colour pattern shown by "S. hierredda" is very similar to that of "S. officinalis". The morphological features that distinguishing this species from the common cuttlefish are that in "S.hierraedda" the number of transverse rows of suckers is higher, for specimens of similar mantle lengths, the striated zone on the cuttlebone of common cuttlefish from the northeastern Atlantic is shorter than the same feature in "S. hierredda", however, in common cuttlefish from the Canary Islands this character is not useful because the striated zone is the same length as it is in this species, the mantle of "S. hierredda" is narrower and the arms are shorter. Genetic differences are consistent and sampling revealed no signs of hybridisation in specimens samples off Senegal where the two species are sympatric. As its vernacular name suggests the giant African cuttlefish is a very large species which can grow to a mantle length of up to 500mm and a weight which can reach 7.5 kg.
Distribution.
"Sepia hierredda" occurs along the west coast of Africa from Cape Blanc in Mauritania south to Baia dos Tigres in Angola. It is also found around the Endeavour Bank off northwestern Africa.
Habitat and ecology.
"Sepia hierredda" starts to spawn early in the year, in February and this continues into September. They have a lifespan of 24 months. Migrations of this species have been recorded off West Africa. Females become sexually mature at a mantle length of 130mm. Where this species is sympatric with the common cuttlefish, then the giant African cuttlefish shows a strong preference for waters above 50m in depth, whereas the common cuttlefish can be found as in depths over of 100m.
Fisheries.
"Sepia hierredda" is a commercially important quarry species for fisheries off the western coast of Africa. In waters off Western Sahara and Mauritania, "S. hierredda" is the main species caught by Spanish trawlers.

Tschanz drive

The Tschanz drive or Oerlikon single-axle drive is a fully sprung single-axle drive for electric locomotives named after its inventor Otto Tschanz or after Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon. The drive was not widely used because its competitor, the Buchli drive, was cheaper and lighter.
Construction.
The Tschanz drive is a fully sprung drive, which means that the motors are housed in the sprung part of the locomotive and are thus less exposed to shocks from the rails. Also, the shocks from the wheelsets to the rail are reduced because there is less unsprung weight on them.
The traction motor is firmly mounted in the locomotive frame and drives through a single-stage gearbox to a gear that is located to one side of the wheel. The power transmission from this gear to the axle is done with a cardan shaft which has universal joints at both ends and passes through a hollow axle. 
The Tschanz drive was not widely used because its competitor, the Buchli drive, was cheaper and lighter.
Use.
Rolling stock on which the Tschanz drive was used include:

She has been recognized in the field of psychology for her contributions to the advancement of Ethnic Minority Psychology. She has been associated with the APA (American Psychological Association), and the National Hispanic Psychological Association along with many other associations. She is the 2018 recipient of the Anthony J. Marsella Award from the Psychologists for Social Responsibility.
Early life.
Patricia Arredondo was born on July 16, 1945 in Lorain, Ohio to parents Apolinar Arredondo Orozco and Evarista Zaldívar. Patricia was the second born of seven siblings. Her father Apolinar encouraged his children to keep their Mexican roots by speaking Spanish, learning about their history and traditional dances. This quickly ignited her interest in the studies of different culture and traditions. On the other hand, her mother Evarista encouraged her children to follow a more American life style due to the discrimination she frequently faced while growing up. Patricia shared a close relationship with her father due to his egalitarian views. He taught his children equally regardless their gender.
Although Patricia was not the firstborn she carried a lot of responsibilities as her eldest sister suffered from mental illness, at the time known as emotional issues. As an adult her sister was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
Growing up Patricia was taught to take pride in her work and to have the desire to change the world. She was a very bright student and at time when under stress from her mother she sought refuge in the library. There she could learn and experience what ever she pleased; she often found herself reading about Boston a city she dreamed of relocating to. She used this desire to fuel her academics, putting her in the top third of her class in high school.
Education.
Against her mother's wishes but with the support of her father, Patricia Arredondo attended Kent State University where she obtained her undergraduate degree in Journalism and Spanish. Soon after graduating she decided to take a job teaching Spanish in Brookline, Massachusetts. Patricia enjoyed her new job in Brookline as it was really close to her dream town of Boston. It wasn't long before Patricia needed a challenge so she decided to enroll at Boston College to pursue a masters program in school counseling, due to the positive experience she had with her counselors growing up. While she completed her studies she became more aware of the lack of ethnic knowledge in terms of individual counseling. She soon decided to further her education this time by attending Boston University to obtain her doctoral degree in counseling psychology. During her time at Boston University Patricia participated in the bilingual fellowship program, to further her studies in ethnic differences. Finally in 1978 Patricia obtained her doctorate being the first in her family to do so.
Career.
Patricia Arredondo began her career shortly after graduating from Boston University in 1978. She relocated to the nearby state of New Hampshire taking a job as an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire. In 1979 Patricia relocated back to Boston taking a job at Boston University as an Assistant Professor. She remained in the same job position until 1985 when Patricia decided to fund her own company, Empowerment workshops INC. The goal of the company was to provide companies with strategies to increase diversity within the workplace.
After many years working for herself in 1999 Patricia Arredondo returned to teaching this time as a professor at Arizona State University. She remained in the same position for a couple of years until 2006, when she was given the position of Deputy Vice President and University Dean for Student Affairs at Arizona State University. She remained in the same position until 2007 when she accepted a job at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee as interim Dean of the School of Continuing Education and Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.
Several years later in 2013 Patricia relocated to Chicago accepting a position as President in the Chicago School of Professional Psychology. Patricia remained in the position until 2015 when it was eliminated. In 2016 she returned as a professor at Arizona State University.

<doc id="56641738" url="?curid=56641738" title="Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police">
Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police

The Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police were a law enforcement service in the Kraków Ghetto. The Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police were a local force of the "Jüdischer Ordnungsdienst," often abbreviated as OD. The OD were overseen by the Judenrat of each ghetto. The Kraków OD, unlike many other Jewish Police forces, served as willing enforcers of Nazi policies and the Gestapo. Among other duties, they oversaw the liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto and helped transport Jews to Bełżec extermination camp.
Leadership.
Symcha Spira (also: Symche Spira, Symche Spiro, or Symche Shapiro) was the Chief of the Kraków OD. Unlike the Kraków Judenrat, the Kraków OD were extremely unpopular under Spira's leadership. In part because of Spira's sycophantic qualities, the Kraków OD collaborated with Nazi officials and local police to a greater degree than other ghettos. The Civil Division of the OD in particular worked closely with the Gestapo.
Spira spoke German and Polish poorly. Before the war, he worked as a glazier, making very little money. He was chosen for the position for his extreme loyalty to the Germans, as well as for his derision of his fellow Jews. Spira was known to wear outlandish, tailored uniforms while patrolling the ghetto. He beat and extorted the ghetto's inhabitants, becoming very wealthy under Nazi occupation.
Duties.
The Kraków Ghetto OD was created in July 1940, with a force of around 40 men. This number quickly grew, and in December 1940, the force had expanded to an estimated 130 men. Members joined in the hope of being spared punishment from Nazi officials, as well as to leverage additional favors. Many Jews who had joined in the hopes of protecting their community, like some on the Judenrat, quickly resigned when faced with rampant corruption and violence within the force.
The creation of the OD was initially suggested as originating from the Judenrat, in the hope of presenting treatment of the ghetto inhabitants as a Jewish issue. Spira refused to follow the direction of the Judenrat, instead deferring to SS and Gestapo orders. Members of the Judenrat expressed frustration at the actions of the OD, claiming they did not have the interests of fellow Jews in mind.
In general, the duties of most Jewish Police forces revolved around the implementation of German orders. This involved keeping streets clear and addressing crime within the ghetto. Later, many Jewish Police forces would shift to assisting German authorities in rounding up Jews for labor, deportation, and extermination. The Kraków OD often went above and beyond German orders, defying the Judenrat, and arrested Jews who smuggled in food. Extortion, bribery, and physical violence were used by Jewish Police, who recovered food and smuggled items for their own families.
The Kraków OD were unsympathetic to resistance movements within the ghetto, and would arrest suspected members of the Jewish underground without hesitation. The Jewish Police also helped to track, arrest and kill partisans alongside the Gestapo. Underground movements constantly targeted OD members, who feared being accused of collaborating with resisters. The OD patrolled the ghetto carefully, searching for resistance hideouts, which they would then report to the German authorities. This participation made OD members the targets of retaliatory actions from both the Underground and German authorities.
Symcha Spira took advantage of the German authorities' poor view of the Judenrat, and sought to convince Gestapo agents of his superior power and influence over fellow Jews. This included carrying out orders the Judenrat would not. He and other OD men passed bribes to the Gestapo, winning favors and privileges in return. The Gestapo promised OD members safety after the war's end, forging foreign papers for many of the men. Some of the OD men were also given visas for travel to other countries, which they attempted to use as conditions in the ghetto worsened.
Liquidation of Kraków Ghetto.
The OD were also in charge of recording and preparing lists of Jews in the ghetto for deportation. They also assisted German and Polish Blue Police in rounding up Jews. The OD entered houses and apartments at night, taking those selected for removal under cover of darkness. Jews who could not present a work permit or proof of employment were held in the courtyard of the OD building, which had formerly been a Catholic orphanage. The gathered Jews were transported the next morning by railroad car to Bełżec extermination camp.
One of the largest deportations of residents began on May 30, 1942 and lasted until June 8th. This was part of the larger Operation Reinhardt occurring across occupied Poland. Approximately 5,000 Jews without work permits or proper identification were taken via train to Belżec. During this "aktion," members of the OD worked alongside German and Polish Blue Police, throwing away luggage, inspecting papers, and beating those who did not comply with orders.
During subsequent deportations, the OD occasionally intervened, bribing officials when family members or friends were selected for deportation. Sometimes this was successful, but other times, even Spira's interventions could not spare everyone. In March 1943, the ghetto was completely liquidated. Those who remained were sent to Plaszów or Auschwitz, or were murdered on site.
The Kraków OD were initially exempted from deportation. After the liquidation of the ghetto, the Jewish Police assisted in cleanup and the processing of items left behind by those deported. They also assisted in moving the bodies of those murdered in the ghetto. Many, including Spira, believed Nazi promises that they would be given their freedom and would be allowed to travel to America or another country after the war. Not long after the liquidation of the ghetto, the OD and all remaining Jews were deported to Płaszów and murdered.

Gaius Petronius (consul 25)

Gaius Petronius was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul from September through December AD 25, succeeding Cossus Cornelius Lentulus. Bartolomeo Borghesi has argued that Gaius Petronius is the same person as Gaius Petronius Umbrinus, who is mentioned in an inscription from Rome as "curator locorum publicorum iudicandorum"; this is unlikely since all known Petronii in the first half of the first century belong to the branch of the Petronii lacking a cognomen.
Petronius was grandson of Publius Petronius Turpilianus, one of the "tresviri monetalis", and probably grandson of Publius Petronius, prefect of Egypt. Publius Petronius, suffect consul in 19, was probably his older brother.

Spinning (comics)

Spinning is a graphic novel memoir by cartoonist Tillie Walden that was first published by First Second Books on September 12, 2017. The memoir chronicles Walden's years coming-of-age as a competitive figure skater, as she navigates romance, bullying and various traumas. It won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work.
Synopsis.
At the start of "Spinning", Walden is ten and her family has just moved to Texas from New Jersey. Walden, a competitive figure skater, finds herself having to adjust to the new environment and figure skating culture. As Walden becomes more disenchanted with the culture around the competitive sport, she discovers her talent as an artist. Having known she was gay since she was five, Walden also struggles with the alienation and pressure she faces as she embarks on her first romance with another girl. The novel also recounts Walden's sexual assault by her SAT tutor.
Development.
The idea for "Spinning" first came to Tillie Walden when she attempted to make a short comic about ice skating at the end of her first year at the Center for Cartoon Studies. Walden realized that she had "too much baggage with skating to even make a small comic about it," and began working on the book that summer before her second year. "Spinning" was initially Walden's school thesis and upon graduating, she worked with First Second Books to turn her thesis into the final graphic novel.
Having published three fictional graphic novels before "Spinning", Walden noted that it was a lot harder, but far more rewarding, to write the memoir than works of fiction. According to Walden, revisiting the trauma she faced was difficult and "there were scenes in Spinning where [she] just cried the entire time [she] drew it."
Reception.
In her review, Rachel Cooke of "The Guardian" wrote: "Intimate and charming, "Spinning" already has the feeling of a coming-of-age classic – and yet, amazingly, its talented author has only just hit 21." "The New York Times"s Douglas Wolk described the novel as "engrossing, gorgeously quiet", while "The Austin Chronicle"s Wayne Alan Brenner called it a "powerful work of real-life storytelling". "Publishers Weekly" noted that the memoir is "a haunting and resonant coming-of-age story," while "Booklist"s Sarah Hunter called it "a stirring, gorgeously illustrated story of finding the strength to follow one's own path."
"The Daily Dot"s Gavia Baker-Whitelaw concluded that: "Spinning is a raw and intimate memoir, and likely to appear on many “best-of” lists for 2017. It's honest and sensitive, holding a different appeal for a wide range of viewpoints. As a coming-out story, it’s painful and therapeutic. To figure skaters, the depictions of the sport and its culture will doubtless ring true. And for childhood overachievers, it’s a firsthand observation by someone who grew up and escaped through an unexpected avenue."
"The A.V. Club"s Oliver Sava named "Spinning" as one of the best comics of 2017, and it 
was tied for third place in "Publishers Weekly" 2017 Graphic Novel Critics Poll. The novel won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work, making Walden one of the youngest Eisner Award winners ever at 22.

Violet A. Johnson

Violet A. Johnson (1870 – November 21, 1939) was an American civic leader and suffragist. 
Early life.
Johnson was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. She became a domestic servant for the John Eggers family in the early 1890s, first in New York, then in Summit, New Jersey in 1897 where the family relocated. 
Community work and suffrage.
Johnson served as a housekeeper to the Eggers family for 45 years. In the late 1890s, she also organized a Bible study group that became Summit's first African-American church, Fountain Baptist Church. At the church, Johnson was founder and president of the missionary society and president of the Deaconess Board, among other leadership roles. By joining the all-white New Jersey Women's Suffrage Association (NJWSA), Johnson's leadership helped transform New Jersey's women's suffrage movement into a multi-racial movement.
During World War I, she organized black women and girls for war relief work, and kept the clubs going after the war. After suffrage was won in 1920, she organized voter registration campaigns, and gave speeches on behalf of candidates she endorsed. 
In the late 1920s Johnson established the Girls Industrial Home, a school for training African-American women and girls for domestic work. She was a founder and officer of the Summit chapter of the NAACP, and served as a trustee of the National Training School for Women and Girls in Washington, D.C. She was also active in the Federation of Colored Women's Clubs of New Jersey, as chair of its anti-lynching campaign.
Personal life.
Johnson died in 1939, in Summit, New Jersey, aged 69 years. Florence Spearing Randolph officiated at her funeral service, at the church Johnson founded.

Neptune (1785 ship)

Neptune was launched in America in 1778. She enters "Lloyd's Register" as "Neptune" in 1786. (She apparently entered British ownership in 1785, but "Lloyd's Register" was not published in 1785.) She then sailed as general merchantman. In the late 1790s she was a whaler. She is last listed in 1803, though the data is stale and she was last surveyed in 1797.
Career.
"Lloyd's Register" (1786) lists "Neptune" with P. Martin, master and owner, and trade London–Jamaica, changing to London–Maryland. "Lloyd's List", however, reported on 4 October 1784 that "Neptune", Martin, master, from Suriname, had arrived at Hispaniola, and was expected to sail from Port au Prince to Quebec in mid-August.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 5 June 1789 that "Neptune", Martin, master, had had to put back into Waterford after having been out some three weeks. She had become very leaky.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1797 shows "Neptune"s master changing from J. French to T. Hopper, and her trade to London–South Seas.
Captain Hopper sailed "Neptune" in 1797 on a whaling voyage to the East Coast of Africa. She was at Delagoa Bay in late June 1798. There, on 28 June 1798, Captain Sever, of the East Indiaman , chartered "Neptune", Hopper, master, and two other English ships, "London", Keen, master, and , Kerr, master, to carry "Lion"s cargo back to England. "Lion" had been carrying a cargo from Madras and Columbo to England when she had put into Delagoa Bay in distress. Despite the efforts of the three other English ships and three American ships there, "Lion" could not be saved.
"Neptune" and "Eliza" towed "Lion" farther up the Maputo River and then remained for some weeks. Eventually, all three British whalers left with only a portion of the cargo. The bulk of "Lion"s cargo was to go on "Britannia", which had since arrived.

Better Call Saul (season 2)

The second season of the American television series "Better Call Saul" premiered on February 15, 2016, and concluded on April 18, 2016. The ten-episode season was broadcast on Monday nights in the United States on AMC. A spin-off-prequel of "Breaking Bad", "Better Call Saul" was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, both of whom also worked on "Breaking Bad".
This season, like the previous, mainly takes place in 2002, with Bob Odenkirk reprising his role as Jimmy McGill, a lawyer who has a feud with his brother Chuck (Michael McKean). Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is Jimmy's former Hamlin, Hamlin &amp; McGill (HHM) mailroom co-worker, now an HHM attorney and Jimmy's lover, who leaves the practice of law at HHM to start a solo practice in office space she shares with Jimmy. Jonathan Banks reprises his role as Mike Ehrmantraut; he is engaged in a feud with the Mexican drug cartel after an altercation with Tuco (Raymond Cruz), which was orchestrated by Nacho Varga (Michael Mando). This draws Hector's (Mark Margolis) attention to Mike.
The second season of "Better Call Saul" received acclaim from critics and six nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series.
Production.
During the production of season one on June 19, 2014, AMC ordered a second, 13-episode season of "Better Call Saul" to air in 2016. However, by November of that year, season two had been shorted to 10 episodes.
Casting.
Mark Margolis and Daniel and Luis Moncada reprise their roles from "Breaking Bad" as Hector "Tio" Salamanca and Leonel and Marco Salamanca, playing Tuco's uncle and cousins respectively, who are high-ranking members of the Mexican drug cartel.
All of the main cast returned for this season; Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill, Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut, Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler, Patrick Fabian as Howard Hamlin, Michael Mando as Nacho Varga, and Michael McKean as Chuck McGill.
Filming.
Production for the second season of "Better Call Saul" began in June 2015, two months after the first season finished airing. "Better Call Saul" is set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same location as its predecessor.
In the first scene from the first episode of the season, Jimmy hides his real identity under his Gene Takavic alias while working at a Cinnabon in an Omaha, Nebraska shopping mall. The Cinnabon scenes in "Better Call Saul" are set in Omaha, but filmed at the Cottonwood Mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Episodes.
Taking the first letter of each episode title and rearranging them yields "FRINGSBACK" ("Fring's back"), foreshadowing the reappearance of "Breaking Bad" character Gus Fring.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
"Talking Saul".
"Talking Saul" is a live aftershow hosted by Chris Hardwick, which features guests discussing episodes of "Better Call Saul". These episodes discussed the season two premiere and finale episodes of "Better Call Saul".
Reception.
Critical response.
The second season of "Better Call Saul" received acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has a score of 97%, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Better Call Saul" continues to tighten its hold on viewers with a batch of episodes that inject a surge of dramatic energy while showcasing the charms of its talented lead." On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the second season has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
Terri Schwartz of IGN rated the season an 8.7 out of 10, praising the acting performances and cinematography, but criticizing the lack of focus, stating, "There's a lot to love in Season 2 of "Better Call Saul", but still some elements to improve upon." Chuck Bowen of "Slant Magazine" gave it a perfect four star review and wrote, "the show's writing is as economic and poetically parred [as its visual aesthetic]. Each moment is compact, leading to the next with unpredictable, behaviorally astute precision". Daniel D'Addario of "Time" praised the show's ability to stand out as a spin-off but retain some of the elements of its predecessor, writing, "in its second season, ... "Better Call Saul" allows us into a new world of complexity by deepening one of the show's pivotal relationships. It's the best-case scenario for a spin-off: a show that occupies a familiar world but opens up entirely new themes."
Ratings.
 Live + seven-day DVR playback viewership was unavailable, so live + three-day is listed instead.
Comics.
AMC released a digital comic book as a tie-in for "Better Call Saul" titled, "Better Call Saul: Saul Goodman and the Justice Consortium in the Clutches of the Judgernaut!" in February 2016, prior to the season two premiere.

Drumlaydan

Drumlaydan () is a townland in the 
civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It is also called Bonebrook locally. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Drumlaydan is bounded on the north by Culliagh and Cronery townlands, on the west by Sradrinan townland in County Leitrim, on the south by Sraloaghan townland in County Leitrim and on the east by Bellaleenan and Torrewa townlands. Its chief geographical features are the River Blackwater, County Cavan, a stream, a mill-race, forestry plantations, a quarry and a spring well. Drumlaydan is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 125 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Drumlaydan was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as "Dromledane" and the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford".
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there was one taxpayer in the townland- "Feragh McGowan of Dromledan".
On 10 April 1716, Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone the son of the aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet, granted a lease for lives of certain lands, including "Drumledan", to James Kirkwood of "Owen Gally" (Owengallees). In a marriage settlement made 18 Oct 1718 with his wife Katherine (née Lowther), the said James Kirkwood settled the lands, including "Drumledan", on his children. Katherine Lowther's sister-in-law, Jane Lowther (née Beresford), was the daughter of the aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, which is probably how the lease came about. James Kirkwood was son of Reverend James Kirkwood, Chaplain to King William III of England, Prebendary of Kilskeery and Rector of Magheracross parishes in County Fermanagh from 1693.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Dromledan".
Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co. Cavan, gentleman made the following will-
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list six tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- "It is bounded on the south and west sides by a large stream in the bed of which limestone can be procured."
The Drumlaydan Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839–1840.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 39, being 21 males and 18 females. There were six houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 3, being 2 males and 1 female, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There was one house in the townland, it was inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists two landholders in the townland.
On 6 July 1857 the Incumbered Estates Commission published the following notice-
In the Matter of the Estate of James Brien, Geo. Brien, Edward Brien and Francis Brien, Owners. Exparte by Isabella Crummer, Petitioner. The commissioners having ordered a Sale of the Lands of Shanadaragh and Curnagunlogh, Cullegh, Drumlohgher, Drumledin, Sananaragh, and Drumledin and Corlough, situate in the Barony of Tullyhaw, and County of Cavan, held under lease dated 10 April 1718, from the Bishop Raphoe, for lives renewable for ever, and which Lands are included in the denominations of Ballymagord, Owngally, Gortneglough, Drumedin or Ballylennin, in said lease mentioned:
In 1861 the population of the townland was 14, being 8 males and 6 females. There were two houses in the townland and both were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are six families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland.

Thelenota rubralineata

Thelenota rubralineata is a species of sea cucumber in the family Stichopodidae, in the phylum Echinodermata, mainly located in the central Indo-Pacific region. It has a distinctive coloring pattern, and can be found on the seabed near coral. "T. rubralineata" is part of the Thelenota genus, characterized by their large size and the presence of a calcareous ring.
Description.
"Thelenota rubralineata" has an elongated, roughly trapezoidal body 30 to 39 cm long and 8 cm wide in its uncontracted state. Like other "Thelenota," it has well marked differences between its ventral and dorsal surface, with papillae and pedicels covering its dorsal surface, and numerous podia scattered randomly on its ventral surface. The dorsal protrusions are arranged in two rows of 13 to 15 large, conical arms, many of which ending in spiked papillae. The sides of the body are also covered in a continuous row of multipapillate protrusions, with smaller outgrowths distributed randomly over the body.
The body of "T. rubralineata" is covered in a complex pattern of red lines on top of a white base. Towards the middle of the body, these lines run parallel and intersect, forming maze-like patterns. The conical protrusions are also covered in this pattern, with papillae ending in white peaks. The podia are pale greenish-yellow, while the tentacles, twenty in number, are red.
Distribution and habitat.
"Thelenota rubralineata" is found on outer coral reef slopes with large rubble and coarse sand patches near islands 20 meters and deeper. This species is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific region.
Biology.
Like other "Thelenota," "T. rubralineata" contains calcareous spicules in the form of granules and branched rods. Located throughout the body wall, these structures serve as both structural support and defense from predators. Two Polian vesicles provide the basis for locomotion. 5 longitudinal muscles are broad, V-shaped, and attached to the body wall. A short digestive tract, two narrow respiratory trees, and a small circulatory system running parallel to the intestines is also present.
When in motion, the lateral protuberances play a role in walking. When disturbed, "T. rubralineata" bends its body in a helical fashion, arranging its mouth close to the anus, and assumes this position for up to 10 minutes or longer, then moves again.
Lifespan for this species is currently unknown. However, like other echinoderms, "T. rubralineata" is suspected to regenerate. As a result, lifespan cannot be estimated, but is assumed to be greater than multiple decades in their natural environment.
Commercial uses.
"Thelenota rubralineata" and other species of echinoderms are commonly harvested in the Western Central Pacific region. "Thelenota" is often harvested in many regions of Micronesia, Polynesia, Melanesia, Australia, and New Zealand. When observed by divers, "T. rubralineata" was widespread but rarely found in large densities. Although "T. rubralineata" is not one of the most economically profitable species for fisheries, this species may become more prone to over-fishing due to a reduction in more commonly used species of echinoderms.

Low-point system

Low-point system is a point system in the Racing Rules of Sailing where all the boats in each race of the series score the same number of points as they finish in the race, so that the first boat to cross the finish line gets one point, the second two points. Boats that don't start, finish, retires or are disqualified are scored one more point than the total entrants of the series. For example, in a series with nine entrants, a disqualified boat scores 10 points in the race it is disqualified in. The low-point scoring system is usually used to score individual events with a fixed number of entrants. For season long series of events where the numbers of participants varies from race to race alternative scoring systems are in use.

Giovanni Antonio Leoni was a Roman violinist and composer in the 17th century. Little is known about Leoni's life besides that he was an active composer in Rome. The only major work by Leoni that is preserved is a publication in 1652 titled "Sonate di violino a voce sola ... Libro primo Opera terza", a score with a violin part. Leoni explains in the preface of the piece that he previously had composed many sonatas and symphonias, and it is dedicated to cardinal Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta. The work is a collection of thirty one sonatas for violin and "basso continuo", the first known collection to be entirely dedicated to solo violin. Leoni's work as a musician is first evidenced in 1634, when he was paid to play violin for a church.

Nideggen Castle

The ruins of Nideggen Castle () are a symbol of the town of Nideggen in Germany and are owned by the county of Düren. The rectangular hill castle was the seat of the powerful counts and dukes of Jülich and had a reputation in the Middle Ages of being impregnable.
History.
Nideggen Castle was built by the counts of Jülich in the strategically important border area of the then Herrschaft ("Lordship") of Monschau. It was intended to protect the inherited territory of the counts against the interests of the archbishops of Cologne.
The foundation stone for the castle was laid in 1177 by William II on the construction of the "bergfried", which was erected within sight of the imperial castle of Berenstein. It was located about three kilometres to the west and was built around 1090. After its almost complete destruction around 1200, it served as a quarry for the extension of Nideggen's castle tower. The yellowish ashlar blocks of the Berensteins differ markedly from the red-coloured sandstone blocks forming the lower half of the tower, which were broken at Nideggen.
Construction work was continued by William  III. Like his ancestors, his successor was also at odds with the Electorate of Cologne. In 1242, after a successful battle, William IV left the then Archbishop, Conrad of Hochstaden for nine months in the dungeon of the keep. But he was not the only one who got to know the walls of that dark prison. A few years earlier (around 1214), Duke Louis of Bavaria had to "make his quarters there". And Conrad's successor to the throne of the Archbishopric of Cologne, Engelbert II of Falkenburg, was also held captive there by the Jülich counts for more than three years in the period from 1267 to 1271.
Under Gerhard of Jülich, the settlement of "Nydeckin" was founded near the Burgflecken. Gerhard granted Nideggen town rights in 1313.
William V, later Duke William I started to extend the castle in 1340, the "palas" at Nideggen being one of the largest castle halls built in the Rhineland. In the late Middle Ages, only the Emperor's hall of Aachen Town Hall and the Gürzenich in Cologne approached similar dimensions. William I was also the one who made Nideggen Castle his family seat in 1356.
After the death of Rainhald of Jülich, the castle went to the family of the dukes of Berg, whose heads from then on called themselves the Dukes of Jülich and Berg.
With the extinction of the House of Jülich and Berg in 1511, Nideggen went into the possession of the Duchy of Cleves.
Hereditary disputes between the House of Cleves and Emperor Charles V over the Duchy of Geldern culminated in the Guelders Wars (also known as the Jülich feud), in the course of which the castle and town of Nideggen were destroyed by imperial artillery in 1542.
In 1689, the castle was suffered a similar fate. During the War of the Palatine Succession, troops under Louis XIV once again looted and burned it down. Earthquakes in 1755 and 1878 did the rest. The castle fell into ruins, was seized by the French and was sold by them in 1794 for demolition. It was subsequently used as a quarry.
It was only on the initiative of the Nideggen townsfolk that an end was put to this. The castle was bought jointly and secured in 1888. In 1905, the county of Düren was given the castle as a gift. It is still in their possession today.
From 1901, the castle was rebuilt for the first time and used as a museum of local history, but attacks during World War II caused unprecedented damage to the building structure. Reconstruction did not begin until the 1950s. The first steps have been taken to ensure that the Romanesque parish church of the castle site is restored. The tower house was then restored in its original form and became home to the first castle museum in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1979.
Description.
Castle garden.
The square castle garden is enclosed by walls and was built after the Middle Ages. A gate in the north-western corner of the wall led to the Burgflecken. In the middle of the west side stood a house from the Baroque period, which has not survived. It had walls linking it to the outer castle gate.
Outer gate with "zwinger" and gatehouse.
The outer castle gate, built in the 14th century, served as an entrance to the smaller, outer courtyard of the castle, which at the same time had the function of a "zwinger". In the 16th century the gate building was replaced. It was not until the 18th century that the entrance was covered by a two-storey, south-east-facing building timber-framed house. This so-called gateman's house ("Pförtnerhaus") was reconstructed in 1979 after having been destroyed during the Second World War. Today it is used by the Düren branch of the German Alpine Club and Nideggen Mountain Rescue Team.
Inner castle gate (main gate).
The late Romanesque gate building has been the only access to the main castle since time immemorial. It is connected to the donjon of the castle by a curtain wall. After the gate had been destroyed by wars and earthquakes, it was rebuilt between 1901 and 1906 and extended with a staircase on the west side.
Tower house.
Built between 1177 and 1190, the tower house is the oldest part of Nideggen Castle. On its eastern side is a deep neck ditch. Around 1350, the tower was increased in height to six storeys. Inside, the castle chapel is on the ground floor, next to the dungeon. The remaining floors each have two rooms which, in addition to living quarters, were used as storerooms and garrison rooms ("Mannschaftsräume").
The tower was heated and had toilets from its early days. To be able to defend it well, its elevated entrance on the south side was well above ground level and could only be reached by ladder. Only when the main gate and the enceinte had been built, were the present ground-level entrance and a staircase tower built. After the roof had been sold for scrap at the turn of the 18th century, the brickwork suffered great damage in the period that followed and this was not rectified until 1906. From 1925 to 1944, the donjon housed a local history museum. After severe damage in the Second World War, it was rebuilt in 1954 and 1955 and furnished with a roof again in 1979. Since then, it has housed the first castle museum in North Rhine-Westphalia.
"Palas".
With a length of 61 metres and a width of 16 metres, the "palas" was the largest hall building on a German castle of the 14th century. Both on the ground floor and on the upper floor, it housed a two-nave hall with twelve large cross-windows. On its west and east side it is flanked by two octagonal side towers. At the north-western corner of the "palas" there was originally a staircase tower, on whose foundations stands the small tower of today's restaurant. Remains of columns are still to be found in the middle of the hall building, as well as remains of walls indicating the former location of the north wall. In the front wall was a secondary staircase to the upper floor. Below the palace there are cellar vaults, some of which are filled in. Among other things, they served as a kitchen.
Kitchen tower.
The east flank of the "palas" is protected by an octagonal tower from the middle of the 14th century, whose height until 1944 was still 14 metres. Fragments of a staircase, which presumably led to the top of the tower, have survived. The lower floor served as a storeroom. Primarily, however, the tower had to fulfil defensive functions, as indicated by its very small window apertures.
West Tower (so-called "Damenerker").
The West Tower with its large windows also consists mainly of 14th century buildings and served representative purposes. Inside, there are remains of a chimney, which is why the cabinets are also found here for the female members of the count's family.
Well.
The castle well partly followed a natural crevice and was once 95 metres deep. Since 1945, however, it has only been about 30 metres.
Buildings on the west and north side.
The appearance of the buildings that used to stand on the west and north side of the castle is largely unknown. The present ones were rebuilt between 1901 and 1906 on old foundations. After their destruction in the Second World War, they were rebuilt again between 1948 and 1950. Today the castle restaurant is located here.
Castle museum.
The Castle Museum opened in 1979 in the castle's tower house. It offers a glimpse of the Eifel region, which is rich in castles, through its exhibitions which cover an area of approximately 600 square metres. These enable the visitor to learn interesting facts about the function and the cultural significance of castles, as well as life in a medieval castle. In addition, they cover regional historical topics such as the important noble families of the Eifel and the history of the Duchy of Jülich.
Festival.
In the summer, the county of Düren used to hold annual festivals at Nideggen Castle until 2010. In 2011, the festival venue moved to Schloss Merode.

Raising Bertie

Raising Bertie is a 2016 American documentary film directed by Margaret Byrne and produced by Ian Robertson Kibbe, Margaret Byrne, and Jon Stuyvesant. It was distributed by Kartemquin Films and aired in shortened form on the 30th season of PBS's documentary series "POV" on August 28, 2017.
North Carolina native and Grammy-nominated rapper J. Cole is one of the executive producers of the film.
Release and awards.
"Raising Bertie" premiered at Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in 2016, and subsequently screened at 25 more festivals. The film won multiple awards including the Documentary Feature Special Jury Award at the Atlanta Film Festival, Best Director at the Atlanta Underground Film Festival, Best Documentary Feature at Atlanta Docufest, and Best First Time Director at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles
Critical reception.
Critically, the film has been well received. Kimber Myers of the Los Angeles Times called the film an "impressive directorial debut ... alternates between triumph and tragedy, but there's never a moment that doesn't feel intimate and authentic." In IndieWire, Bryn Gelbart called the film "astounding and powerful." Alan Scherstuhl from The Village Voice called the film "essential ... Charts nothing less than what it's like to try to grow up free in the prison capital of the world," and Scott Pfeiffer of The Moving World said the film "deserves a place beside the great achievements in longitudinal film."
Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film "powerfully drives home what is obvious and yet what most of us fail to see: Bertie County is America. It's Chicago. It's Detroit. It's Los Angeles. It's a portrait of communities and families striving to do right by their kids, but where schools and lack of job programs fail to meet communities' most desperate needs." Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said "I never would have heard of Bertie, North Carolina if it weren't for this movie, and using art to learn about every corner of our country seems more essential than ever."
Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said "the experiences and challenges of the rural poor might make it into the national conversation as an abstraction, but rarely with the specificity of this intimate portrait of a black community." Brian C. Bush of The Huffington Post called the film "starkly poetic" and said it "brilliantly weaves the young men's stories together, as they transition from their teens into manhood, engaged in a shared struggle for social and economic survival."
Executive Producer Gordon Quinn said of the film, ""Raising Bertie" challenges us to see the value in lives too often ignored, those of rural America and emerging adults."

Bourne Park House

Bourne Park House is a Queen Anne style country house on Bourne Park Road, between Bishopsbourne and Bridge near Canterbury in Kent. Built in 1701, it has been listed Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England since 1954. An 18th century red brick Ice house and a bridge that spans the Nailbourne that feeds the lake in the grounds of Bourne Park are both Grade II listed.
Originally known as Bourne Place, the present house was commissioned by Elizabeth Aucher, the widow of Sir Anthony Aucher. Built in place of an existing building belonging to the Bourne family, it is large red brick rectangular mansion of two storeys with attic and basement and a hipped tile roof. There is a 13 bay frontage, of which the central 5 bays project surmounted by a pediment containing a Venetian window. The interior, altered in 1848, contains a good 18th-century staircase, panelling and ceilings.
The house is surrounded by parkland of which all but the adjacent 3.6 hectares (9 acres) are now separately owned. Notable features of the gardens are the 18th-century lime avenue, the yew walk and fine examples of Wellingtonia and cork oak. Some trees were lost in the storm of October 1987. There is also a private cricket pitch.
Bourne Park is a site for ongoing archaeological research by the University of Cambridge. Several reports have been published to describe findings which include both archaeological features and artefacts. The evidence suggests usage of the area dating from the Bronze Age. The earliest artefact found is an Iron Age silver coin and there have been numerous findings associated with Roman Britain.
History.
Lady Aucher built and maintained the house during the minority of her only son, Sir Hewitt Aucher, Bt, passing it over to him in 1708. He left it to his elder sister, from whom it passed by marriage to the Beckingham family. After spending the night in nearby Canterbury, Leopold Mozart, his wife Anna Maria, and their children Maria Anna and Wolfgang Amadeus, spent the last week of July 1765 at the house as part of the English leg of their European grand tour before their departure for the Hague. The Mozarts were visiting Sir Horatio Mann, Bt. who had leased the house. Mann was an avid cricketer and a number of top-class cricket matches were held between 1766 and 1790 at the Bourne Paddock ground which he built in the park. In 1844 it was sold to Matthew Bell (1817-1903), in 1927 to Major Sir John Prestige.
The poet and architectural critic John Betjeman listed Bourne Park as one of the "casualty list of attractive English buildings to be destroyed" in his 'City and Suburban' column in "The Spectator" in February 1956. A 1965 article in "Country Life" described the estate as possessing 57 acres, and noted Prestige's extensive renovations, but said that the house had been "unoccupied in recent years and now needs to be restored and modernised". It was sold in the 1960s to Richard Neame who sold the house to a monastic community in 1976. It was subsequently sold c.1982 to Lady Juliet Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, then wife of Somerset de Chair, MP and now of Christopher Tadgell.
The house is home to the Fitzwilliam Collection, a notable private art collection that Lady Juliet has inherited as a descendant of the Earls Fitzwilliam. The collection was formerly housed at Wentworth Woodhouse, the Fitzwilliam's traditional country seat in South Yorkshire. The collection is not on public display and pieces are rarely loaned to public collections. Among the collection are portraits by Anthony van Dyck and Joshua Reynolds and works by the equine artist George Stubbs. The collection also includes a copy of John James Audubon's monograph "The Birds of America". Lady Juliet's daughter, Helena (née de Chair) is married to the Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg. He proposed to her in front of one of the six Van Dyck paintings at the house.

Zellweger spectrum disorders

Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of rare disorders that create the same disease process. The subdivisions of this spectrum are hyperpipecolic acidemia, Infantile Refsum disease, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and Zellweger syndrome. It can also be referred to as Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum, NALD, Cerebrohepatorenal Syndrome, and ZSS. It can affect many body organs, including the kidneys, eyes, and hearing. It is named after Hans Zellweger.
Signs and symptoms.
The symptoms of the disorders can vary from every patient. Most symptoms are noticeable at birth. There is often lack in growth and muscle tone as the child develops. Also the disorders involve neurological problems. This would include frequent seizures, delays in intellectual development, and the absence in basic reflexes.
Facial abnormalities are also often common with patients. Including a small chin, upturned nostrils, and a mouth with a highly arched roof. There are also a variety of eye abnormalities that could happen. The eye abnormalities including clouding of the cataracts and retinopathy, which can lead to vision loss. Children with Zellweger Spectrum disorder can have hearing loss with onset during the first months following birth.
Infants with the disorder can also have abnormalities including their organs. They might have a large spleen or liver, as well as heart defects. Including holes in the heart, and high blood pressure. Due to the lack of muscle tone, infants can face respiratory problems as the disease progresses.
Causes.
Zellweger spectrum disorders are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders. They are caused due to pathogenic mutations in at least 13 different "PEX" genes that encode peroxins. It affects the peroxisomes, which are organelles in the body that are meant to breakdown items like acids and toxic compounds. Both parents will have to have the recessive gene for the child to show symptoms. If one parent has the gene and the other one does not, the child will be a carrier and will not show symptoms. Any mutation involving the genes that create or work the peroxisomes can lead to the development of any of the Zellweger Spectrum Disorders. Both genders have an equal chance to end up with these disorders.
Diagnosis.
Definite diagnosis requires evaluation of peroxisomal functions. Mutation analysis is done from fibroblast cell lines.
Treatment.
Treatment may involve a team of specialists. This would include neurologists, endocrinologists, and pediatricians.
Early intervention is important when treating someone with these disorders. Special education, physical therapy, and other medical services to aid the child through treatment. There are medical trials taking place to learn more about these disorders. Most infants that are diagnosed do not live past 6 months.It can be diagnosed by a blood test looking for PEX genes in the body.
Epidemiology.
It occurs in 1 in 50,000 individuals.

Early life.
Lucy Evelyn Davison was born to A.S. and Lucy A. (Fox) Davison in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1864 or 1865. She was educated in convents in Ohio and attended school in Washington D.C. She worked as a secretary assistant in the Bureau of Ethnology in D.C. for 9 years where she met Major William Sloane Peabody, an executive officer of the US Geological Survey, whom she married on March 4, 1895. When William retired the pair moved to Denver, Colorado.
Mesa Verde conservation.
Peabody is most notable for her work to establish Mesa Verde, a notable archeological area of preserved Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings in Colorado, as a National Park. She worked closely with Virginia McClurg over the course of 9 years to achieve this goal, and is now known as "the mother of Mesa Verde."
After an attempt to establish Mesa Verde as a National Park failed in 1894, McClurg persuaded the Colorado State Federation of Women's Clubs to create a committee to advocate for the Colorado cliff dwellings. McClurg led the group as it expanded and branched off into the Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association, which was established in 1900 with 19 charter members. The motto of the group was "Dux Femina Facti" or "feminine leadership has accomplished it," and was headed by Virginia McClurg as regent and Lucy Peabody as vice-regent. The group's goal was to preserve the Mesa Verde ruins and protect them from individual archeologists or developers. In 1901, they secured an agreement with the Weeminuche Utes for exclusive water rights and permission to build and maintain roads. The women worked hard to gain support for their cause, showing the land to members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Peabody also published an official report regarding the restoration and preservation of Native American ruins in 1900.
The movement was gaining momentum, but McClurg changed her stance in 1904 and wanted Mesa Verde to instead be a State Park administered by the Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association. Peabody maintained her initial stance and split off from McClurg, leaving the Colorado Cliff Dwellings Association along with a number of the other members.
Peabody travelled to Washington D.C. to continue her lobbying. Edgar Hewett of the Archaeological Institute of America, helped her to push the Herschel M. Hogg Bill regarding the park to be approved. The Hogg Bill was passed on June 7, 1906, but unfortunately contained boundaries for the park which excluded all of the major ruins. This error was quickly improved with the Brooks-Leupp Amendment on June 29, 1906 which determined that all ruins within 5 miles of the original boundary are to be treated as part of the National Park.
In 1907 Peabody was recognized by the American Anthropological Association for her work in establishing Mesa Verde. Her friend, Dr. Edgar Hewett named the Peabody House (or the Spruce Tree House) in her honor.
Personal life.
Peabody was a member of numerous associations and groups. This included membership in the Colorado Equal Suffrage Association, Colorado Society of the Archaeological Institute of America, National Geographic Society, Direct Legislation League, Women's Club of Denver, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was one of the founders of the American Anthropological Association. She worked for the passage of child labor laws, traveling libraries, and the recognition of Lincoln's birthday as a state holiday. She was known to be a Democrat and to favor women's suffrage.
She died on September 19, 1934 in Denver, Colorado.

Benito Vergara

Dr. Benito S. Vergara (June 23, 1934 – October 24, 2015) was a scientist in the Plant Sciences, and was conferred the rank and title of National Scientist of the Philippines in 2001, the highest honor bestowed by the Philippine Government for the work of Filipino scientists. Vergara was also behind the development of the Rice Museum and Learning Center, and is known for his extensive plant catalogues in rice and ornamental plant varieties, as well as his work starting the "Farmer's Primer on Growing Rice", an illustrated manual explaining basic rice growing concepts.
Early life and education.
Dr. Benito Vergara was born on June 23, 1934 to father Jose Vergara, a medical doctor, and Luisa Sibug Vergara, a nurse. He was the youngest of seven children, and was raised primarily by his older sisters Betty, Lucy, and Belen Vergara who taught him household skills and chores.
In 1955, he attained his Bachelor's degree in Botany from the University of the Philippines Diliman as a pre-medicine major to become a medical doctor like his father. In his senior year at UP Diliman, Vergara was recommended to replace a friend who had backed out of an opportunity to pursue a master's degree in the University of Hawaii at Manoa to become a Jesuit priest. The opportunity to attain a master's degree abroad in place of his friend, was described by Vergara as a turning point in his life wherein his education led him to become a scientist instead of a medical doctor. After accepting the recommendation to go to UH Manoa, Vergara completed his Master's degree in Botany in 1959 before attending the University of Chicago for his PhD in Plant Sciences and completing it in 1960.
After his education, Dr. Vergara returned to the Philippines intending to join the UP faculty. Instead, he was asked by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Director Dr. Robert Chandler, to help start the IRRI laboratory with Dr. Bienvenido Juliano, another scientist who will eventually be awarded National Scientist in 2000. The work at the IRRI would involve cataloguing, screening, and eventually breeding different varieties of rice. In 1961, Dr. Vergara joined the IRRI as an Associate Plant Physiologist in 1961.
Work in the IRRI.
Vergara and Juliano were given the task to build the IRRI laboratory from scratch as there were no research programs, gene bank, screening protocols, or other scientists involved. Vergara and Juliano were given blank checks to order laboratory equipment and supplies for the laboratory, before being joined by other scientists to set the research agenda for the plant physiology work at the institute. After starting the laboratory, Vergara became the head of the Plant Physiology Department and head of the Agronomy, Plant Physiology, and Agroecology Department until 1991. In 1992, he was promoted to Director for Administration until his retirement in 1996.
Vergara's work in the IRRI focused on three major research areas: the flowering response of rice to photoperiodism, rice physiology, and deep water rice.
Literature publications.
The farmer's primer on growing rice.
While working in the IRRI and traveling to rice-growing countries, Vergara noticed that farmers and extension workers had difficulty with technical and scientific information about growing rice. Vergara identified the source of the problem to be the materials and language used to explain rice growing concepts. Due to this gap, Vergara collaborated with his student, Fred Bacorro, and created an illustrated manual on planting rice that would discuss concepts such as farm management, farm analysis, and improvement. In 1979, the first print run of Vergara's book "The Farmer's Primer on Growing Rice" was published as a commercial book. After the first print run, the IRRI took over publication of the primer in 1982. Since its publication, the primer has been translated into over 50 languages, and is in use around the world among agriculturists, extensions workers, and farmers.
Plant catalogue.
After the publication of "The Farmer's Primer on Growing Rice", Vergara continued to catalogue plants. He published a collection of catalogues that primarily focused on rice, before moving to ornamental plant varieties.
Children's literature on rice.
Vergara led a children's book project called "Gabby Ghas" endorsed by the Department of Education. The goal of the book was to teach children the process of rice production from the planting stage to the feeding stage. The book centers around Gabby Ghas, a tiny grain of palay on a journey of self-discovery to feed a hungry boy. The book was written in 2009 by Virna Karla Sebastian, Erika Thea Ajes, and Aya Arce.
"Gabby Ghas" has won several awards conducted by the Asia Rice Foundation, the Alpha Phi Omega Service Sorority, and the Philippine Department of Education.
Rice museum.
During Vergara's last years at IRRI, Vergara developed a rice museum to educate the public on the science and culture of rice around the world. The Riceworld Museum and Learning Center was established in1994 in the University of the Philippines, Los Baños, Laguna and is the only museum and learning center in the world dedicated to rice and rice farmers around the world.
Later life and death.
Vergara married his wife, Lina Manalo-Vergara, IRRI's first head librarian. He has two sons, Sunny and Happy Vergara, a daughter, Joy Vergara, and four grandchildren.
On October 24, 2015 at the age of 81, Vergara died of a heart attack.
Other accomplishments.
Vergara was also a member of the Ornamental Team of the Philippines Council for Agriculture and Resource Research. He was also president of the Los Baños Orchid Society.
Awards.
Vergara has won numerous awards for his scientific work, and work within his community. Awards include:

Sarah McNutt

Sarah Jane McNutt (July 22, 1839 – September 10, 1930) was an American physician, notable as the first woman inducted into the American Neurological Association. McNutt was a founder of the Babies' Hospital in New York City, now known as Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, along with her sister Dr. Julia G McNutt. Her mentors and co-workers Elizabeth Blackwell and Emily Blackwell were some of the first female physicians in the United States. She focused her work on pediatrics, neurology, and medical education.
Early life.
McNutt was born in Warrensburg, New York to parents James McNutt and Adaline (Waite) McNutt. Her twin, Julia, was also a physician. Julia founded the Post-Graduate Training School for Nurses, and worked on the Babies' Hospital with Sarah. Sarah attended the Albany Normal School and the Emma Willard Seminary at Troy, where she learned to teach which was her career for several years.
Medical career.
Education.
In 1877 McNutt graduated from the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary. For two years, until 1879, she interned at the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary hospital. Her colleagues and mentors, Elizabeth and Emily Blackwell and Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, shared interests of hers, including pediatrics and neurology. McNutt worked alongside these women at the medical college and hospital for several years.
Teaching.
McNutt taught a course in gynecology at the medical college and was an instructor of surgery. Along with Dr. Jacobi, she helped to found the New York Post Graduate Medical School and Hospital, which continued physician education through lectures. McNutt gave three per week on pediatrics. She was among the first to teach about both pediatric diseases and the correlation between abnormal pathology and disease states, using the morgue to do so.
Pediatrics.
McNutt spent much time working towards creating the field of pediatrics, designing a specialty in diseases of women and children. McNutt found, using a citywide survey, that there was no pediatric ward in any New York hospital. There were only 10 beds dedicated to the pediatric population. After creating a pediatric ward at the New York Post Graduate Medical School in 1888, McNutt and her sister Julia opened the Babies' Hospital for children two years old and younger. The name of the hospital has changed multiple times, and the age of patients has expanded from two years and under to up to 20 years of age.
Medical Societies.
American Neurological Association.
McNutt became the first female member of the American Neurological Association (ANA) when inducted in 1884, at the 10th annual meeting. Royal W. Amidon, secretary of the ANA in 1883, was a consultant of the hospital where McNutt worked. McNutt had clinical contact with ANA members C.L. Dana and William A. Hammond, through her work at the medical school and hospital. Amidon and Hammond were the two members to nominate McNutt. At her induction meeting, she presented her ANA thesis on double infantile spastic hemiplegia.

Ellen Jorgensen

Ellen D. Jorgensen (born 2 June 1955) is a New York-based molecular biologist leading the do-it-yourself biology movement. She works to increase scientific literacy in the general population, particularly in the fields of molecular and synthetic biology. She is a co-founder of both Biotech Without Borders and Genspace. In 2017, Ellen Jorgensen was named one of the Most Creative Leaders in Business by Fast Company.
Education and career.
Ellen Jorgensen graduated from New York University (NYU) in 1977 with a B.A. in Biology. She then went on to earn both her MA and MPhil in Biological Sciences from Columbia University in 1979 and 1981, respectively. Jorgensen returned to NYU where she obtained her Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology in 1987 from the Sackler Institute. She later went to SUNY Downstate as a post-doc to continue research in protein structure and function.
Jorgensen devoted many years of her career to various positions within the biotechnology sector. She spent eight years, from 2001 to 2009, as the Director of Biomarker Discovery and Development at Vector Research, researching early biomarkers of tobacco-related lung disease. In 2009, she co-founded the community biohacker space, Genspace. In 2017, Jorgensen founded Biotech Without Borders, a second nonprofit community biotechnology lab.
Ellen Jorgensen is currently adjunct faculty at The Cooper Union in New York City. She has given two TED talks: "Biohacking -- you can do it, too" and "What you need to know about CRISPR", which have received over two million views.
Genspace.
In 2009, Ellen Jorgensen co-founded Genspace, the first nonprofit community biotech lab. In 2010, Jorgensen initiated Genspace's curriculum of informal science education, leading to the company being named one the World's Top 10 Innovative Companies in Education. The goal of Genspace is to increase scientific literacy in the general public by providing classes and workshops, as well as a space for community members to get involved in a biotechnology laboratory. In March 2017, Ellen Jorgensen stepped down from her role as execute director, to be replaced by Genspace co-founder, Daniel Grushkin. Jorgensen became president emeritus.
While Genspace was created with the goal of making scientific literacy more accessible, the organization was met with criticism by those that felt that hands-on science should be left to the professionals. Despite this criticism, Genspace has continued on, along with a larger community of hacker spaces opening worldwide, fostering an open environment of scientific collaboration and learning between amateurs and professionals.
Genspace is located in Brooklyn, New York. The lab follows Biosafety Level 1 restrictions. Different membership tiers are offered providing access to events, classes, lab access, participation to community projects, and more. In the spring of 2018, community projects will be offered in the fields of mycoremediation, open plant collaboration, and optogenetics.
Biotech Without Borders.
In 2017, Ellen Jorgensen stepped down from her leadership role at Genspace in order to found Biotech Without Borders, where she now acts as President. Biotech Without Borders is a Brooklyn, New York based nonprofit public charity dedicated to enabling communities underrepresented in the biotechnology field to gain hands-on biotech lab experience. Biotech Without Borders focuses on providing a Biosafety Level 2 lab space, distributing biotech resources to labs worldwide, and engaging the public through hands-on lab classes, workshops, and events. It is the first Biosafety Level 2 lab open for public projects. Compared to Genspace, Biotech Without Borders seeks to facilitate engagement with more authentic high-level science.

Aleksandr Kharitonov (politician)

Aleksandr Petrovich Kharitonov () is a Ukrainian politician who appeared in media during the pro-Russian unrest in March 2014. He is the first leader of Russian separatists forces in Luhansk region. He is one of the pioneers and founders of the Russian Spring in the Eastern Ukraine.
Biography.
Since 2005 he was a member of the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine and in 2007 unsuccessfully ran for being elected as a People's Deputy of Ukraine from the party. He also actively participate in the PSPU anti-NATO protests for which in 2008 he was awarded a party badge "Fighter of anti-NATO resistance". In the late 2013 Kharitonov actively participated in Anti-Maidan protests, later organized and led "Luganskaya Gvardiya" (Luhansk Gvardiya).
2014.
According to "Korrespondent", on 5 March 2014 Kharitonov was elected at a multi-thousand gathering as a "Narodny Gubernator" (People's Governor) following the example of the Pavel Gubarev's election.
Kharitonov proposed to elect "Narodny Sovet Luganschiny" () and scheduled a new gathering on Sunday 9 March 2014 to present the People's Soviet. From the stage where Kharitonov spoke, it was announced that there were elected 15,000 signatures to conduct a referendum and appeal for help to Vladimir Putin. The referendum for federalization of Ukraine was scheduled on 30 March 2014.
On 9 March 2014 after storming the building of Luhansk Oblast State Administration, Aleksandr Kharitonov read out loud a letter of resignation which as he claimed is signed by Mykhailo Bolotskykh. Bolotskykh himself left the building with a help of militsiya detachment and did not make any official declarations in that regard. The Ukrayinska Pravda printed an article about the event taken from a local newsmedia and showing the whole process in photos. Over the building raised a Russian tricolor and the crowd sang the Russian anthem. The local militsiya that was present at the scene stood without reaction stating that cannot arrest everyone. The Euromaidan community informed that many buses from Russia arrived to Luhansk and the "local princes" Oleksandr Yefremov, Arsen Klinchaev, Aleksandr Kharitonov, and chief of SBU Tretiak facilitated intensification of situation. That fact was later confirmed by a former chief of militsiya in Luhansk Oblast.
Arrest.
On 13 March 2014 Kharitonov was arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine. He was convicted to 5 year with probationary period of 3 years for an attempt of violent change of the constitutional order and seizure of government buildings. In the case of mass riots in Luhansk on 9–10 March 2014 Kharitonov appeared along with Arsen Klinchaev. Later Kharitonov was exchanged for hostages and left for Moscow where he organized few pro-separatist Donbass demonstrations titled as "Za Novorossiyu" (). On 7 November 2014 he returned to Luhansk where he reregistered his Luganskaya Gvardiya and joined the local "Kazak National Guard" led by Nikolay Kozitsyn (see Republic of Stakhanov). Following the conflict with Anastasiya Paterikova, Kharitonov left the Kazaks.

Emma Sheridan Fry

Emma Sheridan Fry (pen name, Polly and E. V. Sheridan; October 1, 1864 – 1936) was an American actor, playwright, and teacher. She started her career as a stage actress and after retiring from that, she became a writer for various periodicals and wrote plays. In 1903, she established the Children's and Young People's Theatre in New York City. Also in that city, she served as director of the Children's Educational Theatre and the Educational Players, as well as teaching at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
Early years and education.
Emma Viola Sheridan was born in Painesville, Ohio, October 1, 1864. Her mother, Emma Christina (Huther) Sheridan, was a niece of the New England clergyman, Rev. Joseph W. Parker. Her father, Congressman George Augustus Sheridan, fought with the Army of the Cumberland during the American Civil War, and later developed a national reputation as an orator. Fry was always his friend, confidant and counselor.
She was a graduate of Mrs. Hay's preparatory academy, Boston, Massachusetts, and of the Normal College in New York City (now, Hunter College). Choosing the stage as the field of her work, she went through a thorough course of study and training in the New York Lyceum School of Acting (now, Lyceum Theatre). She graduated from the American Academy Dramatic Arts, 1885.
Career.
Fry began at the bottom and in six seasons, she rose to the front rank among American actors, filling many important roles. In 1887, she played a notable engagement with Richard Mansfield in the Lyceum Theatre, London, England. Returning to the United States, she played a round of leading Shakespearean parts with Thomas Keene. In 1889, she became the leading lady in the Boston Museum Company. At the close of her second and most successful season there, her stage career was cut short by her marriage.
During her stage experience, Sheridan was also a writer of general syndicate newspaper work, writing many articles, stories and verses published in the daily press, in magazines and in dramatic papers over her signature. She was well known as "Polly" in the "New York Dramatic Mirror", writing the "Polly Papers". She also wrote a "Wednesday Afternoon" column for the Boston "Commonwealth", which included theater reviews and dramatic commentary. After her retirement from the stage, Sheridan, for she retained her signature, "E. V. Sheridan", devoted all her time to writing, and she was in this second profession rapidly repeating the progress and notable success of her stage career. 
On February 23, 1892, Mansfield produced at the Garden Theatre, New York, a play by Sheridan entitled, "£10,000 a Year", founded on Dr. Samuel Warren's hook of the same name, "Ten Thousand a-Year", and it won a flattering success.
 She prepared a text book of "Educational Dramatics", and Educational Players' Students Arrangement of"Twelfth Night" and "Macbeth".
Founded by Alice Minnie Herts, and with Mark Twain as president of the board, Fry became the director of the Children's Educational Theatre, New York City, in 1904, and conducted all of its educational work till January 1, 1909. She took charge, as dramatic director, of the Educational Players, New York City, in 1910. She was also a teacher at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, 1909-10. At the Children's Educational Tbeatre, she produced "The Prince and the Pauper", written by her from Mark Twain's book; the Abby Sage Richardson play, produced with the Educational Players, 1910; "Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Morris High School, New York; and produced "The Tempest" for Smith College alumnae, 1898.
Fry was a member of the New England Woman's Press Association, and the Pen and Brush Club, New York City. She served as president of the Alumni Association of the Lyceum School of Acting.
Personal life.
In 1891, in Deer Isle, Maine, she married Alfred Brooks Fry, Chief Engineer of the United States Treasury service, a member of the Loyal Legion, and of the Order of the Cincinnati by heredity. They had son, Sheridan Brooks Fry, who was born in 1893. Fry favored woman suffrage. By religion, she was Episcopalian. She died in 1936, in Westwood, New Jersey.

Brody Morgan

Brody Morgan is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Home and Away", played by Jackson Heywood. The actor had previously appeared in the show as Lachie Cladwell in 2009. During the audition process, Heywood was paired up with several different actors until the producers found the right combination for the Morgan family. Heywood began filming his first scenes in December 2015. He made his first appearance as Brody during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016.
Brody was introduced to the show along with his three siblings; Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger). The family received immediate comparisons to the show's popular Braxton brothers. Brody is a passionate and ambitious chef. He is also portrayed as being loyal, smart, and occasionally pessimistic. For the first few weeks after their arrival, Brody and his siblings concealed the fact that they were in witness protection. They were later held hostage by their parents' killer and involved in a plane crash, which left Brody badly injured. Jeannie Woods (Anna Bamford) was introduced as a love interest for Brody in late 2016.
The character became the focus of the show's first storyline about ice addiction, which was a prevalent issue in Australia at the time. Series producer Lucy Addario implemented the storyline, as she felt the show could no longer ignore it. Heywood carried out extensive research, so his portrayal of Brody would be as accurate as possible. Brody uses ice to help him cope with the pressures of running a restaurant. He soon gets into debt with his dealer, leading to major consequences for himself and his family. While recovering from his addiction, Brody begins a relationship with Bay newcomer Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman), whom he later marries. The marriage ends when Brody begins an affair with Simone Bedford (Emily Eskell). The storyline led to the character's exit on 10 June 2019.
Casting.
On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from "The Daily Telegraph" reported actors Jackson Heywood, James Stewart and Orpheus Pledger had joined the cast of "Home and Away" as brothers Brody, Justin and Mason Morgan respectively. All three began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016. During the audition process for the Morgans, Heywood was paired with several actors until the producers found the right combination. He formed an immediate connection with Stewart, Pledger and Penny McNamee, who plays their sister Tori Morgan, and commented "It was really nice to see the ones I had the most connection with were the ones that were given the job."
Heywood had previously appeared in "Home and Away" as recurring character Lachie Cladwell in 2009. He explained that his first appearance in the show was "overwhelming", as it was his first professional acting job, but rejoining the cast alongside three other actors, meant that there was less pressure on him the second time around. The family drew immediate comparisons to the show's Braxton brothers, who were introduced to the show in 2011, which Heywood expected. He stated, "I can definitely see that, but I think we have a very different dynamic. It will be exciting to tell the story and as it will be revealed, it will be a very different story." Brody made his first appearance on 7 June 2016, alongside Justin and Mason.
Development.
Characterisation and introduction.
Ahead of his screen debut, Heywood described his character as "quite jaded and somewhat pessimistic at times, deep down he always has the best intentions and a true heart of gold." He also thought Brody was "passionate" and loyal, with "a wonderful complexity of emotions". Brody's profile on the TVNZ "Home and Away" website states that he can occasionally be "a bit gruff" and he struggles to let people in. Brody is the second youngest Morgan sibling and he shares a close bond with Tori. The death of his parents affected him the more than the others. Heywood later called Brody "the most ambitious" member of the Morgan family, as well as the smartest and most reliable. He also said Brody was the most apprehensive about moving to Summer Bay, as he feels that the town will not provide him with many career opportunities. Elaborating further on the comparisons to the Braxtons, Heywood explained that the Morgan siblings had "a very different dynamic". They all had professions, and are not criminals. Brody is a successful chef and Heywood called him "a real craftsman".
Brody, his two brothers Justin and Mason, and their dog Buddy are driving to Summer Bay to join their sister Tori, who moved to the town five weeks before them, when they are almost involved in a car crash with Martin "Ash" Ashford (George Mason). Brody and Mason desperately try to keep Justin and Ash from fighting. The brothers continue their journey to the Bay, where they find Ash talking with Tori and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) on the beach and another fight almost breaks out, until Tori reveals that Justin, Brody and Mason are her brothers. The siblings wonder if they will be able to stay in their new home this time, leading to the start of their first major storyline.
Witness protection.
An "Inside Soap" columnist observed that the family had been hiding something about their past from the Bay's residents. They initially keep to themselves and Justin warns Tori against befriending local doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). Stewart explained that there were a set of rules that the Morgans had to live by, which related to their secret, and Justin worries when Tori reveals that she told Nate their parents are dead. Mason's former girlfriend Lara Adams (Elle Harris) visits him in the Bay and he tells her that his family are in witness protection. Later that day, Brody informs his siblings that he is being followed, and Justin decides that the family need to pack up and leave.
After Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery) turns up at their house and threatens Tori, the family contact their police liaison officer Atticus Decker (John Adam), who has them moved to a safe house. The family all agree that they are tired of running from the people who killed their parents. Brody is "so far in denial" about the situation that he continues planning menus for his recently purchased restaurant Salt. While he, Justin and Tori are arguing, they fail to notice Mason leaving the house to meet up with Lara, who is revealed to be working with Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), the Morgan's parents' killer. Spike and Blaine get Mason to tell them where the safe house is and the family are held hostage. Blaine produces a gun and threatens to kill them all, before revealing that Justin knew the truth about the circumstances that led to their parents' deaths.
Brody is one of nine characters involved in a plane crash. After receiving a warning from Spike, Justin realises that he has sabotaged the plane being used for Tori's birthday trip. He attempts to contact the pilot Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall) to tell him to land the plane, but the radio communication between them is poor. Meanwhile, a broken pipe leaks carbon dioxide into the cabin. Justin calls Brody to ask him for the plane's coordinates, but he passes out. Duncan also loses conscious, but manages to crash land the plane in the sand first. While most of the passengers escape major injury, Mason soon realises that Brody is missing and he is presumed dead. After the passengers are rescued, Tori and Justin search the bush for Brody, along with Nate and Duncan. They soon find him, but realise he is in a serious condition.
Brody begins recalling memories of his mother arguing with somebody. Heywood said Brody does not remember his mother being an argumentative person, so the memories worry him. Brody turns to Decker for answers, but feels that the police officer is keeping something from him. He soon realises that Decker is the person arguing with his mother, leaving him "confused, angry and worried." The Morgans feel they cannot trust Decker anymore. Soon after, Decker is rushed to hospital when his car is run off the road and he is placed in a coma. Heywood commented, "The family now feel incredibly vulnerable, and it's a hugely traumatic experience. Decker has been like an uncle to them."
While Decker is in the hospital, the Morgans find and meet his nieces Hope (Jessica Falkholt) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble). When Decker eventually wakes from his coma, Brody asks him why he has a memory of him arguing with his mother. Decker tells Brody that he used to work as an undercover officer and that he was tasked with helping to bring down the drugs syndicate that Brody's father worked for. Heywood said Brody senses that Decker's secret is "something much bigger" than he first thought. Decker plans to leave town, and when Hope is arrested, the Morgans agree to look after Raffy. The Morgans later learn Raffy is Decker's daughter and their half-sister. They soon tell her the truth about being in witness protection because their parents were killed by drug dealers, a revelation that she struggles to cope with. The Morgan's secret is soon revealed to the rest of the Bay in the local newspaper, and Brody's restaurant is vandalised.
Relationship with Jeannie Woods.
Producers introduced a love interest for Brody in early November 2016. Actress Anna Bamford joined the cast as Jeannie Woods for six weeks. Woods said Jeannie and Brody would form "an unusual relationship" while she was in the Bay. The actress added that she developed a good friendship with Heywood during filming. Jeannie comes to the Bay to take part in a charity volleyball match arranged by Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast). Brody bumps into her while he is making a food delivery to the event, but she disappears quickly into the crowd. Brody becomes determined to find her, but Bamford said that "things keep happening to stop Brody getting to her!" When Brody finally finds Jeannie, he sees she is playing volleyball with Matt Page (Alec Snow), so he offers Evelyn some money if he can switch places with Matt and partner Jeannie in the competition. Heywood thought Brody was attracted to Jeannie's natural charm and beauty, and said she takes Brody's "breath away".
Brody offers Jeannie a job as a waitress at Salt, which proves awkward for them both. Heywood described Brody as being "a blubbering mess" while he is around Jeannie. She later reacts badly to Brody's attempts at flirting with her, leaving him confused. Heywood admitted that Brody did not have much time for relationships while he and his family were in witness protection. He told "TV Week"'s Stephen Downie, "He's been out of love and out of practice with women for so long, he completely forgets how to read females." At the end of Jeannie's shift, she thanks Brody for giving her the job and kisses his cheek. Brody misreads the situation and kisses her on the lips, causing her to push him into a trolley. Brody asks her to leave Salt, which Heywood called "a terrible reaction."
Jeannie later hides from her father at Brody's home, where she explains that her parents are doomsday preppers. She also tells Brody that she cannot live like her parents, who are preparing for the apocalypse. Heywood said Jeannie's background explains why she is "shy and closed off" around Brody. It also makes it harder for her to express her feelings to him. Brody initially struggles with the revelation, and questions whether he and Jeannie have a future together. Heywood thought there would be restrictions on her life that would not allow Jeannie to have a relationship. Later that night, Jeannie's father Randall Woods (Paul Ceaser) turns up at the house to take her away, as he does not want her to be with someone who is not one of "them". Brody and Jeannie's differences ultimately stop their relationship from progressing.
Drug addiction.
In the character's first issue-led storyline, Brody develops an addiction to methamphetamine or "ice". This was the first time the show had aired a long-running storyline about ice addiction, and at the time it was a prevalent issue in Australia, as demand for the drug had rapidly increased since 2013. Series producer Lucy Addario said the production crew could no longer ignore the subject, and along with the scriptwriters, she implemented the storyline for Brody, who begins using the drug to deal with the pressure of running a restaurant.
Heywood was pleased upon receiving the storyline, saying "I was like, 'Great' because it's such a switch but also really realistic because it does happen to people like that." Heywood carried out extensive research in order to accurately portray an ice addict, while avoiding any stereotypes. He read stories from former addicts, spoke with the show's on-set medic, and with his brother, who is a paramedic. Heywood also recalled his experiences of dealing with a friend who was addicted to heroin, and how that affected his relationships. As the show has an average audience of 1.27 million viewers, Heywood hoped that the storyline would help contribute to a social change.
The storyline begins shortly after Brody catches Mason's university friend Lena Ascot (Felicity McKay) selling drugs in his restaurant. He initially dislikes Lena, but later hires her as a waitress. When Brody catches Lena with drugs again, he tells her that his parents were killed by drug dealers and he fires her. Lena persuades Brody to rehire her ahead of a visit from restaurant critic Terry Diamond (Rob Flanagan). Lena offers Brody cocaine to make him feel calmer, however, Brody becomes over-confident and insults Terry when he give Brody constructive criticism. Heywood told Alison James of "Soaplife" that Brody feels "terrible" and he is acting out of character, which makes his brothers suspicious. Justin searches the storeroom and finds an empty drugs packet, which Brody denies is his. Justin makes Brody promise not to use drugs and to fire Lena again. When Lena texts Brody to ask if he wants more cocaine, Brody accepts and he tells Justin that they are just arranging for her to collect her paycheck.
Brody's continued cocaine use results in him staying out late and suffering from mood swings. When he arranges to meet Lena to buy more cocaine, he finds William Zannis (Caleb Alloway) in her place. Brody is initially reluctant to buy from Zannis, but he is "desperate". Before Brody can take the cocaine, his sister Raffy asks him to drive her to Yabbie Creek. Brody notices a police road block and turns around to avoid it. As the police give chase, Brody hides the cocaine in Raffy's bag. After he pulls over, Brody is taken to the station for a drugs test, which comes back negative. He tells Justin what happened and promises to stop taking cocaine. Justin later finds Brody contacting Lena to buy more drugs, and he tells the rest of the family the truth about Brody's drug taking. Brody's siblings cancel his credit cards, but he steals from Salt and meets with Zannis, who is only willing to sell him ice.
Heywood said Brody's perception of drug use had become "skewed" following his release from witness protection, and he finds that it is the outlet he has been looking for. The actor also reckoned that Brody was feeling "unbearable" guilt about how his addiction is affecting his siblings. However, Brody finds the drugs give him confidence in his ability to run his restaurant. The more Brody uses ice, the more he begins to rely on it. Brody agrees to sell drugs for Zannis to pay his debts, but the packet of drugs falls out of his coat pocket and is eaten by Buddy. Raffy throws the rest of the packet away, leaving Brody further in debt to Zannis. Needing money, Brody visits a pawn shop to sell Raffy's necklace, but upon receiving a low evaluation, he smashed up the shop. Heywood commented, "He's unhinged and in a rage – and he's making bad decision after bad decision." Brody then hijacks Scarlett Snow's (Tania Nolan) car. She gives him her handbag so he will leave, but Brody feels guilty about his actions and attempts to return it. Scarlett finds Brody in her house and knocks him out.
As the storyline progresses, Brody's addiction leads him to lose ownership of his restaurant and ruin his relationships with his sibling and friends. Heywood found that aspect of the storyline to be "the most realistic", pointing out that an addict usually does not see how much stress their family comes under. Brody also suffers at the hands of Zannis, who wants Brody to take delivery of a package of drugs at Salt. When Brody refuses and threatens to go to the police, Zannis retaliates by breaking into the Morgan's house and poisoning the water jug with potassium, leading Tori to be hospitalised after she drinks from it. Brody later hits rock bottom and "flies into an ice rage", which results in Mason and Justin having to restrain him. They have to lock him in his bedroom, but Brody escapes and steals from Scarlett. Brody is then found to be staying at a drugs den in Mangrove River and his brothers bring him home. He is arrested for his crimes and later learns that Raffy has temporarily moved out for her safety.
After Brody learns Zannis has been released on bail, he worries that the drug dealer will come after him. Brody's paranoia causes him to relapse and Mason finds him searching through the bin for drugs. Mason convinces Brody to let him drive him to rehab, so he can get some help. Brody soon becomes convinced that Zannis is following them and he grabs the wheel from Mason, causing their car to leave the road and crash. While Brody suffer minor injuries, Mason is left paralysed after suffering spinal damage. The crash is "a wake up call" for Brody, who vows to get help for his addiction. He sells his restaurant to fund his place at a private rehab out of town.
Relationship with Ziggy Astoni.
A trailer released in June 2017 for the show's new Astoni family appeared to show a new love interest for Brody in the form of Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman). Brody meets Ziggy while he is attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. When he goes to the bathroom, Ziggy suddenly enters and asks Brody to hide her. Brody agrees and hides Ziggy in his car, as her father Ben Astoni (Rohan Nichol) comes looking for her. Of the moment, Dillman said, "Brody questions what he's doing, but Ziggy doesn't give him a choice." Brody and Ziggy meet again the following day at the Surf Club, where she declines his offer of a tour of the area. Brody and Ziggy spend time together and agree not to talk about their pasts. They eventually share a kiss, however, Ben puts a stop to a potential relationship when he discovers Brody is a drug addict.
Brody's drug dealer, Zannis, notices Brody and Ziggy are close, so he kidnaps her and holds her hostage at a motel. Zannis tries to get Ziggy to text Brody asking him to meet her, but she refuses. Dillman commented that Ziggy "tries everything she can to protect Brody." When Zannis threatens her with a gun, Ziggy finally sends the text to Brody. When Brody turns up at the motel, he is expecting "a sexy rendezvous" with his girlfriend, but finds himself tied to a chair and confronted by Zannis instead. Brody feels guilty for bringing Ziggy into his problems, and they are both scared when Zannis explains how he will kill them with an overdose. Kat tracks Brody down to the motel, but she is attacked by one of Zannis' henchmen and knocked unconscious. Zannis attempts to move Brody and Ziggy to a new location, but they are rescued by Robbo (Jake Ryan), who was in the back of Kat's police car.
As Ben disapproves of their relationship, Brody and Ziggy agree to date in secret. But when Justin catches them sneaking out of Brody's bedroom, things between them become "super-awkward". Justin is Ziggy's boss and he threatens to tell Ben, as they are good friends. Both Brody and Ziggy beg Justin not to tell Ben, but Brody later suggests that they should just tell her parents they are dating. Ziggy reacts badly to the suggestion, and Dillman said "She knows it will go badly, and she really doesn't want her relationship with Brody to end." Ben discovers that Ziggy has been dating Brody in secret, leading to an argument when Ziggy asks him to give Brody a chance. Ben ends up throwing Ziggy out. Realising that the relationship is causing problems between Ziggy and her family, Brody suggests that they break up. Of Brody's decision, Heywood stated, "He loves her. Which makes it so much harder, because if he wants to do the best by her, he kind of has to keep his distance."
Brody and Ziggy begin spending time together again, and Ben gives them his blessing to be friends again. Daniel Kilkelly of "Digital Spy" noted there was "clearly a spark between Brody and Ziggy", which does not go unnoticed by Ben or his wife Maggie Astoni (Kestie Morassi), who tells Ziggy that she should be with Brody if she loves him. A brief love triangle develops when Ziggy's former boyfriend Jarrod McGregor (Joel Davies) comes to the Bay to win her back. Dillman told an "Inside Soap" writer that Ziggy hates Jarrod for cheating on her, and she does not want to ruin what she has with Brody. However, Jarrod refuses to accept that Ziggy no longer loves him and he convinces her to spend time with him. After taking Ziggy out on his bike, Jarrod kisses her, but it makes Ziggy realise that she wants to be with Brody.
In December 2017, a "Home and Away" fan photographed Dillman and Heywood filming wedding scenes at Palm Beach, the show's outdoor filming location. Scenes featuring the couple getting engaged were broadcast in May 2018. Ziggy proposes to Brody, after reading a letter from her mother, who wants to see her daughter marry amidst her battle with lymphoma. Ziggy arranges for her family and friends to gather outside Salt, before she unfurls a large banner asking Brody to marry her. Brody is "stunned" by the proposal and readily accepts. However, writers threw an obstacle in the couple's way, by having Brody overhear Maggie questioning Ziggy's motives for the engagement. Ziggy assures her mother that she loves Brody, but he later calls off the engagement. After Ben convinces Brody that he and Ziggy "are made for one another", Brody makes his own banner to accept Ziggy's proposal again.
Brody and Ziggy's wedding storyline aired on 28 June 2018. The scenes were filmed at the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and Dillman described them as being "just beautiful". Heywood was also excited to film the wedding, saying "It's so cool to be part of "Home And Away" history as another couple who get married." Jackie Brygel of "New Idea" speculated that there could be problems for the couple shortly after the wedding, with Dillman commenting "You can never have smooth sailing in Summer Bay. You'll have to stay tuned!" The couple move into Ziggy's parents' house, which leads to tension and problems within their marriage. Heywood said the wedding stressed Brody and moving into Ben and Maggie's home "feels like a backwards step".
Affair and departure.
In November 2018, Simone Bedford (Emily Eskell) was introduced as a potential love interest for Brody. Simone wins a cooking lesson with Brody at an auction. When Ziggy comes to apologise to Brody for an argument they had, she notices that Simone is flirting with Brody. Eskell commented that Simone has "a career crush" on Brody. As Simone and Brody begin working together, they end up sharing a kiss. Heywood explained that there had been a slow build up of "underlying tension" between Brody and Simone, before the kiss. Brody realises that he has betrayed Ziggy and feels a lot of guilt. He reiterates to Simone that he married and that it was a mistake, but he is also in denial as their attraction towards one another grows. Heywood thought his character was "fooling himself" by pretending nothing is happening.
Heywood admitted to Sarah Ellis of "Inside Soap" that he was not happy with Brody's infidelity storyline, saying "It was a very difficult plot for me to deliver – it really challenged me." Brody asks Simone to leave the restaurant, as he cannot work alongside her anymore. Heywood told Ellis that Brody is confused, as he loves his wife, but he is falling for Simone, who he has more in common with. Brody later lies to Ziggy that he does not have the time to train Simone. When Justin notices Brody is hiding something, Brody admits that he kissed Simone. Heywood hoped Brody would be honest with the ones he loves and brave enough to make the tough decisions about his future.
Simone returns to the restaurant to see Brody and they end up having sex. Simone is "horrified" when she learns Brody has not broken up with Ziggy, while Brody is feels immense guilt when Ziggy wants to celebrate their one-year anniversary. Brody and Simone continue their affair, while Ziggy starts making plans for the future, and later announces that she has sold their honeymoon vouchers for a house deposit. Simone overhears this news and ends her relationship with Brody. Eskell commented, "She feels like a home-wrecker. It's an awful, awful feeling." Justin, who knows about the affair, witnesses the exchange and confronts Brody about pursuing Simone while married. Brody ignores his brother and pleads with Simone to give him another chance, but she criticises him for not being able to choose between her and Ziggy. Brody then tells Justin that he loves Simone and wants to leave Ziggy to be with her.
Brody attempts to make his marriage work, but soon tells Simone that he loves her. Justin encourages Brody to come to a decision and stop "messing Ziggy around". Meanwhile, Ziggy makes plans for the couple to have a baby, which Brody appears to go along with, until he meets up with Simone and reconciles with her. Brody and Simone's affair is exposed when Ziggy catches them in bed together in Simone's caravan. Dillman told Sarah Ellis of "Inside Soap" that her character is "absolutely heartbroken, and in disbelief. Their marriage is completely torn to shreds." Ziggy goes home and packs her belongings, while Brody begs her give him a chance to explain. Ziggy initially thinks they can fix their marriage, but she then overhears Brody saying he loves Simone. Dillman said that Ziggy realises that he has fallen out of love with her. Dillman felt the best thing about the storyline was how honest the writing is.
After Simone is branded a "homewrecker" in some graffiti at the school, she decides to resign and move away from the Bay, as she cannot cope with being known as a "scarlet woman". After telling Brody that they can have a long-distance relationship, he suggests that they leave the Bay together. Heywood explained that the situation has been harder on Simone, as she has no connections to the Bay, but neither of them appear to have anyone on their side. He commented, "I think they do both need to start a new life somewhere else." The development led to speculation that the characters would be making their exits from the show. In May 2019, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that Heywood had not been seen filming on set. Brody departed the show during the episode broadcast on 10 June 2019. Heywood found his exit was "a bit bitter-sweet", however, he admitted that he had got "everything I wanted from the show".
Storylines.

After Brody is followed and Mason admits to telling his former girlfriend that his family is in witness protection, the siblings are relocated to a safe house by their protection officer, Decker. They are later held hostage by their parents' killer Blaine Varden. Brody suffers a head injury when he is pushed down an embankment by Blaine's associate Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery). Brody is badly injured when he is ejected from a plane that is carrying Tori, Mason and their friends to a vineyard. The plane suffers a carbon carbon monoxide leak and crashes when the passengers and the pilot pass out. Dehydration causes Brody to hallucinate and he falls off a cliff. He is eventually rescued and undergoes surgery at the hospital. Brody recalls overhearing an argument between his mother and Decker, and Decker reveals that they had an affair, which resulted in the birth of their daughter, Raffy Morrison.
Brody briefly dates Jeannie Woods, whose parents are doomsday preppers. When Jeannie feels that Brody has been rude to her father, they end their relationship. Brody takes cocaine after he is offered it by his new waitress Lena Ascot, and they have sex in the store room. Lena continues to supply Brody with cocaine. While he is high, Brody insults a restaurant critic. Justin discovers Brody's drug use and gets Brody to fire Lena. Brody buys more cocaine from Lena, who later sends William Zannis to supply him. When Brody cannot afford to pay for cocaine, Zannis sells him ice instead. Brody develops a dependence on ice, which results in debts and strained relationships with his siblings and friends. Zannis also has Brody beaten up, after he loses a large quantity of ice, which Zannis expected him to sell. Brody later smashes up a pawn shop, before jumping into Scarlett Snow's car and forcing her to drive away. She gives him her handbag to get rid of him. When Brody attempts to return the bag, Scarlett knocks him out and ties him up. Brody then tells her about his drug addiction. She befriends the Morgans and allows Brody to stay with her, but he steals from her and goes to a drugs den. After he is brought home, Brody is arrested and charged with theft.
Brody attends a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in the city and helps Ziggy Astoni to hide from her father, Ben. Brody kisses Ziggy and tells her about his addiction. Ziggy's parents disapprove of their relationship. Zannis threatens Brody's family, so Brody arranges for the police to catch them handling drugs and they arrest Zannis. Mason catches Brody looking for drugs and offers to drive him to rehab. Brody panics when he sees Zannis behind them and grabs the steering wheel, causing the car to crash and leaving Mason paralysed. Brody loses the restaurant when it is sold to pay for his stay in a private rehab facility. Brody tells Justin that he witnessed their parents’ deaths and has been trying to distract himself with drugs. Zannis kidnaps Ziggy and Brody, and intends to kill them with an overdose. However, they are located and rescued by Constable Kat Chapman and Robbo. Ziggy asks Brody to leave her alone, but later thanks him for sending Tori to help her with her panic attacks. They date in secret, as Brody is still in recovery. The Astonis discover the relationship, and Brody ends it, as he does not want to be responsible for breaking up a family. Scarlett represents Brody in court and he receives a suspended sentence.
Brody works at the Pier Diner, but is frustrated when he is not allowed to change the menu. He soon buys back Salt. Brody saves Ziggy from being assaulted, but Ben misinterprets the situation and punches Brody. Ben later gives his blessing for them to date. The relationship is tested by Ziggy's former boyfriend, Jarrod McGregor's unsuccessful attempt to win her back, and her mother's cancer diagnosis. Ziggy proposes to Brody and he accepts, but he soon questions whether Ziggy has just asked him to fulfil Maggie's wish of seeing her daughter marry. Ziggy tries to assure him that she wants to marry him because she loves him. Brody then proposes to Ziggy and she accepts. They decide to get married at the lighthouse within two weeks, so Maggie will be well enough to attend. Brody and Ziggy take their honeymoon on a boat, but they are forced to cut it short when Maggie falls ill, so Ziggy can help Ben and Coco look after her.
Reception.
Ali Cromarty and Stephen Downie of "TV Week" were impressed by the new brothers, commenting, "Move over Braxtons, there's a new family of hot brothers in Summer Bay." They also branded them "loyal, caring and hard-working". Downie later called them "the mysterious Morgan brothers" and noted that they landed in "a whole lot of trouble" the moment they arrived. Daniel Kilkelly of "Digital Spy" dubbed the Morgans "Summer Bay's unluckiest family". A "South Wales Echo" reporter observed that there was an obvious spark between Brody and Phoebe. A "New Idea" columnist named Brody a "Summer Bay hunk" and thought he was becoming "the new bad boy in town".
A reporter for the "Birmingham Mail" bemoaned Brody's actions after getting into debt with his drug dealer, quipping "the latest resident suffering from the results of their own ridiculous actions is Brody, who must resort to theft if he's to pay off Zannis. Unfortunately, he fails miserably and ends up getting a beating." When Brody has to sell Salt to fund his rehab, Tamara Cullen of "TV Week" commented, "Ah, Brody. He's certainly made a mess! Now, he has to face the consequences." A journalist for "South Wales Echo" wrote, "The pleasure-pain principle seems to be at play for Brody this week. The pleasure comes from his blossoming new relationship with Ziggy, while the pain comes in the form of a court summons." "Inside Soap's" Sarah was a fan of the character, writing "Not only is Brody a genuinely nice guy, but he can cook as well! Ziggy's a lucky lady..." Seth Adamson from "TV Soap" opined that Brody was a changed character. He added "only months ago he had been in so much trouble with his ice addiction. Brody proved to be a man capable of change. He has worked overtime to win the trust of all in the Astoni family."

BlocBoy JB

James Lee Baker (born May 19, 1996), better known as BlocBoy JB, is an American rapper. He is best known for his song "Look Alive" (featuring Drake), which peaked at number 5 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in 2018. His other songs include "Shoot", "Rover" and its sequel, "Rover 2.0" (featuring 21 Savage).
Early life.
James Baker was born on May 19, 1996, in Memphis, Tennessee. Baker's name comes from his father, who is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for rape. In 2008, when Baker was 12, his father broke out of prison and traveled to Baker's home to see him for a short period of time. At the age of 14, Baker became affiliated with the Grape Street Watts Crips. Although located in Los Angeles, the gang has an affiliated branch in Memphis called the Peda Roll Mafia. Baker's affiliation is mentioned throughout many of his songs, including "Rover". Baker served a month in prison in 2012 for committing a home invasion, and served the rest of his sentence on house arrest. Baker has said the invasion was "sloppy", and that they performed the invasion with no masks and a BB gun.
Baker began making music when he was fourteen when he moved to Raleigh in North Memphis and met Tay Keith (who later produced "Look Alive"), and the two began making music shortly afterwards.
Career.
2012–2016: Early music, fame, and controversy.
Baker started putting out music on his SoundCloud page in 2012. He released his first mixtape, "Who Am I", in 2016. It featured the track "No Chorus Pt. 6", which reached more than three million views on YouTube.
2017–2018: Shoot dance, "Billboard" top 10, and "XXL".
The next summer, he released the song "Shoot", which spawned a dance craze called the "shoot dance". Another single, "Rover", followed in early 2018. The viral hits attracted the attention of Canadian rapper Drake who it was speculated was going to remix "Rover" though it resulted in the pair collaborating on a song titled, "Look Alive", which was released in February 2018 and debuted at number six on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.
Following the release of "Look Alive", Baker spurred rumors he would soon sign to Drake's label OVO Sound, saying "Somewhat. I'm trying to see what's my move." He was also featured on Moneybagg Yo's "2 Heartless" project. On March 23, 2018, Baker released "Rover 2.0", a remix of "Rover", featuring rapper 21 Savage. The song was Baker's second lead song to chart on a "Billboard" chart, peaking at number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles. He was also featured on ASAP Rocky's "Bad Company" and No Jumper's "Hard" with Tay-K.
After releasing the single, "Prod by Bloc", he announced the mixtape "Simi", while also revealing the tracklist which featured Lil Pump, YG, Drake and 21 Savage. Baker was named as one of the members of "XXL" "2018 Freshman Class" on June 12, 2018.
On October 30, 2018, Baker released his debut extended play, "Don't Think That", which included features from Lil Uzi Vert and Hoodrich Pablo Juan.
2019–present: Eighth mixtape and debut studio album.
Baker released his eighth mixtape, "I Am Me", on June 14, 2019, which included features from Lil Durk and Moneybagg Yo. NLE Choppa and Baker, both from Memphis, Tennessee, have done 3 collaborations together, named ChopBloc, ChopBloc 2, and ChopBloc 3, respectively.
In March 2020, Baker released his first official song of 2020, "Swervin". In May 2020, he released his highly anticipated single "No Chorus, Pt. 12", which was produced by longtime collaborator Tay Keith. After a build-up on pre-release singles, Baker's debut studio album, "FatBoy", was released on October 9, 2020.
Controversies.
In October 2017, Baker filmed a dice game allegedly inside of Hamilton High School. Shortly afterwards, Shelby County Schools started investigating the incident.
During an Instagram Live on March 16, 2020, Baker jumped from a two-story balcony into his pool, barely clearing the edge and clipping his heel on the side of the pool.
In June 2020, 6ix9ine had an Instagram Live with DJ Akademiks. In the livestream, 6ix9ine targeted Baker, calling him a "one-hit wonder" and asked if he was working at Wendy's. Baker responded by saying, "Don't mention my name if you ain't on no gangsta shit".
In November 2020, Baker received severe criticism and was accused of homophobia after he said PlayStation was "for the gays" and mocked the brand as "GayStation", even saying that Xbox is for "the street n*ggas".
Baker is known for popularizing the "shoot" dance, which was incorporated in the "Fortnite" video game, made by Epic Games. Following similar lawsuits against Epic Games, Baker filed his own lawsuit against Epic in January 2019, claiming the use of his dance move as a dance emote in-game is infringing on his copyright and personality rights.
Legal issues.
In February 2019, Baker was arrested on drug, gun and robbery charges, weeks after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Later on, in May of that year, Baker was arrested again on gun and drug charges. The arrest happened hours before he was scheduled to perform at the Beale Street Music Festival.
Personal life.
In 2020, Baker publicly voiced his support for United States then-president Donald Trump. He was met with some criticism for this. He has one child.

Great Raid of 2014

The Great Raid of 2014, also known as the Raid of the 95th Brigade, took place from July 19 to August 10, 2014 during the war in eastern Ukraine. According to official information, the units of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, reinforced with assets from the 25th Airborne and 30th and 51st Mechanized Brigades, conducted a 470 km raid, of which 170 km were behind enemy lines. During the raid, the 95th Brigade paratroopers entered into armed clashes with the Russian Army.
Planning.
In June 2014, the country's leadership developed a strategic plan that foresees blocking of the Russian-Ukrainian border by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the surroundings of the cities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In July, the units blocking the border came into the southeast vicinity of Luhansk and in the east of Donetsk regions. ATO command has developed a plan for the release of units at the border. According to the plan, the units of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, 30th Mechanized Brigade, 51st Mechanized Brigade, 25th Airborne were to occupy Savur Mohil, Stepanivka, Marinovka, to establish control over the ferries on the Mius River and to relieve the units of the 24th and 72nd Mechanized, and 79th Air Assault Brigades.
The main strike for of the operation was the 400 paratroopers of the 95th Air Assault Brigade and tanks of the 30th Mechanized Brigade. All taking part in the operation were volunteers.
Results.
According to official information, the paratroopers carried out a 470-kilometer raid on the rear of the separatists, and at the same time destroyed three hostile checkpoints. However, the most important achievement was the creation of a corridor for units trapped at the border to retreat. Thanks to the skillful actions of paratroopers and infantrymen, 3,000 people and more than 250 pieces of equipment were able to be evacuated safely.
Significance.
The raid is noteworthy because of its length and the fact that it was the first time Ukrainian and Russian forces clashed in the War in Donbass. According to Phillip Karber, it was one of the longest armored raids in military history.
The raid was also a significant morale booster for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, especially the Air Assault forces. The skill and conduct of the 95th Air Assault Brigade was praised by American military expert, Dr. Phillip Karber.

Troy Trojans women's tennis

The Troy Trojans women's tennis team represents Troy University and plays in the Sun Belt Conference. All home matches are played at the 12-court Jimmy Lunsford Tennis Complex on Troy's campus.
History.
The women's tennis team began playing in the 1980s, and because of a lack of record keeping during that time, the exact year it was founded is unknown, as well as the yearly records.
In 1995, the Trojan women won their first conference tournament title while a member of the Mid-Continent Conference. That same year, player Claire Mowling was named the Mid-Con Newcomer of the Year.
After becoming a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference in the late 1990s, the women again went on to win another conference in 2004 under head coach Eric Hayes. That year, the women made it to the finals of the Atlantic Sun Tournament, defeating UCF by a score of 4–2. They would receive the automatic bid to play in their first ever NCAA Tournament, matching up with #5 Clemson. The Trojans would be defeated by the Tigers, 4–0.
The Trojans program moved from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Sun Belt Conference for the 2005 season. In 2006, just Troy's second season of being in the Sun Belt Conference, the women's team won the consolation bracket of the Sun Belt Tournament and finished the season with a 16–5 record and a #68 national ranking, their highest final ranking of Eric Hayes tenure as head coach. The doubles duo of Tsitsi Masviba and Claudia Strauss finished their 2006 campaign as the #55 doubles team in the country, going 13-6 during the 2006 season. The Lady Trojans followed that up in 2007 with another winning season, going 13–9 with a national ranking of #72.
Hayes would lead the program to more successful seasons afterwards, accumulating a record of 74-56 between 2008 and 2013 and only having one season with a losing record in that span. In 2013, Hayes' last season as head coach, he coached the women's team to a 17–6 record, putting together a 12-game win streak that was the third-longest win streak in the country during the 2013 season. Troy entered the Sun Belt Tournament as the #3-seed, but was upset by #6-seed Middle Tennessee in the quarterfinals.
Rawia Elsisi, a former Troy women's tennis player, was hired in 2014 as the next head coach for the team. In her first season at the helm, she led the Trojans to a 15–8 record that included a win over then #72-ranked Nicholls State and received the #4-seed in the Sun Belt Tournament. Troy defeated Texas State in the quarterfinals of tournament, only to drop their semifinal match to #66 Georgia State.
In 2018, Troy garnered their first ever #1-seed into the Sun Belt Tournament by way of a 4-2 conference record during the season, despite finishing the regular season with an 8–10 record. Troy had gone a 6-game win streak toward the end of the season, which included a 4–3 win over eventual Sun Belt champion Georgia State. The Trojans won their first round match of the Sun Belt Tournament against #9-seed Georgia Southern but lost their semifinal match to #4-seed South Alabama.

While Clark's original "Civilisation" focused on the influence of western European art, "Civilisations" presents a global perspective on the role that art has played in shaping civilisations across the world, filming across 6 continents, and in 31 countries.
The series is a co-production with The Open University, who provided academic input into the programmes.
Civilisations AR.
As a companion to the series, the BBC will be releasing "Civilisations AR", an augmented reality app that will enable users to view and explore art and historical artefacts from around the world. It was developed internally by the BBC Research and Development team based in London, in collaboration with Nexus Studios.
The app's exhibits include:
Civilisations Festival.
The "Civilisations Festival" is a season of events organised by the BBC in partnership with museums, galleries, libraries and archives across the UK, created to coincide with "Civilisations". It runs from 2 to 11 March 2018 and the trailer for the festival was released on 8 February 2018.
Civilisations books.
Profile Books issued two tie-in volumes adapted by Mary Beard and David Olusoga from their episodes; respectively, these books are "Civilisations: How Do We Look / The Eye of Faith" () and "Civilisations: First Contact / The Cult of Progress" ().
Original broadcast (BBC).
Preview.
The series was launched at a preview event at the National Gallery in London on 6 February 2018. Sir David Attenborough, who commissioned the original series with Kenneth Clark, made a special guest appearance, saying he "cannot wait to see the series". He also stated that the BBC could not simply have reproduced the approach of the original series, stating "Society has changed. We have an international society, a multi-ethnic society. You can't just do it in the way we did it." The first trailer was released on 7 February 2018.
Episodes.
"Civilisations" premiered on 1 March 2018 on BBC Two and BBC Two HD.
Reception.
"The List" gave the series 4 of out 5 stars, based on viewings of the first two episodes: "it's a visual feast as the cameras sweep across ruined cities and townships or focuses in for tight close-ups to emphasis the exquisite details of relics, pottery and sculpture. Even more inspiring is the breadth of knowledge, beautiful nuggets of information and insights into ancient worlds. Accessible and intelligent, "Civilisations" conveys a message of globalism, revelling in the variety of our species' ingenuity on an international scale."
"The Daily Telegraph" in its review of the ninth and final episode concluded: "as nine discrete lectures, delivered by three of our most captivating cultural commentators, interrogating how we view art and what it means to us today, this has been a fascinating project that was undoubtedly worth the effort."
Mark Lawson approved of the series but noted that the "format of TV as lecture theatre" had not changed since the 1969 original. He wrote: "the BBC has spectacularly and intelligently remade its 1969 hit in a way that reflects shifts in cultural and art historical thinking. Less apparent is any sense of fresh reflection about how and why art should be put on TV."
BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz described the series as "patchwork programmes with rambling narratives that promise much but deliver little in way of fresh insight or surprising connections." He commented that although the scripts were "far from being literary masterpieces, the camerawork is of the highest quality throughout [with] plenty of delicious visual treats". He concluded: "a well-intentioned, well-funded series that has top TV talent in all departments but which ended up being less than the sum of its parts."
Andrew Ferguson reviewed and contrasted "Civilisations" with its 1969 original. Ferguson recommended the series and praised the "stunning" imagery. However, he criticised the departure from Clark's chronological approach and a tendency to dwell on the function of featured works of art, particularly if the piece is considered to have preserved the power of an elite class. He wrote: “In the hands of our narrators, art is reduced to an instrument of oppression. If you are uncomfortable with this approach—seeing the glories of human creativity reduced to tools for class warfare—too bad."
The "London Evening Standard" also provided a comparison with the original series: "Is "Civilisations" better than "Civilisation"? It’s different, it’s got modern sensibilities and different perspectives. But it lacks Clark’s authority: his judgments carried weight, though they were challenged in a later series by John Berger. It also lacks the coherence of his single story of Western culture and, yep, cultural relativism is the name of the game. But it reminds us of humanity’s boundless creativity."
"The Washington Post" art critic Sebastian Smee described the PBS series as "compulsory viewing for a new generation of viewers". Smee rejected any comparison with the original: "In truth, the comparison is invidious. "Civilisation" was great, but the series is 50 years old, and looks it. Today, neither Lord Clark’s benign pomposity nor his open disdain for contemporary culture would fly. His focus, too, on the West seems perverse in our globalized era, when we all have become more conscious of the complexity of interactions between cultures throughout history."
Soundtrack.
Former BAFTA Breakthrough Brit Tandis Jenhudson composed the original music for the series, as well as the main title theme (which features soprano Caroline Kennedy). A digital soundtrack will be released on 23 September 2018 and his score will also form the soundtrack of the BBC "Civilisations AR" augmented-reality app on both iOS and Android.
US broadcast (PBS).
Released as Civilizations by PBS in the United States, the individual programmes have distinct treatments and narrative arc, with Liev Schreiber as the series narrator. While maintaining the principal contributions of Schama, Beard, and Olusoga, joining them are international artists and experts including religious studies scholar Jamal J. Elias, INAH anthropologist Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck, art critic Jonathan Jones, Egyptology professor Salima Ikram, Asian Art Museum director Jay Xu, and history professor Maya Jasanoff.

Union of Women Painters and Sculptors

The Union of Women Painters and Sculptors ("Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs)" was founded in 1881 in Paris as a society for the promotion of female artists. The Union was founded by sculptor and educator Hélène Bertaux (Mme. Leon Bertaux) and had as many as 450 members at its peak. Noted members include Virginie Demont-Breton, who became president after Bertaux in 1894, and artist Marie Bashkirtseff.
Opportunities for women within the Parisian art world in the 19th century were limited. The influential École des Beaux-Arts did not begin admitting women until 1897. Prior to that year, the only state-sponsored option for women’s art education was the National School of Drawing for Young Women ("École Nationale de Dessin pour les Jeune Filles"), which received less funding than men’s schools. Additionally, women were prohibited from joining many other existing exhibition groups, schools, and public art spaces.
The Union’s goals were to create a community to educate and support female artists and by displaying their work. They published the "Journal des femmes" "artistes" newsletter, where members of the Union could communicate and comment. They also founded and organized the annual Salon des Femmes as an exhibition of women’s art exclusively. The Salon was intended to be a non-traditional and non-hierarchical exhibition, including decorative arts and giving new and established artists equal access to preferred hanging spaces. The first Salon des Femmes occurred in January 1882, and the Union continued to organize and publicize the event eachyear. At the 1896 Salon des Femmes, 295 women exhibited their work. In addition to these efforts, members of the Union, especially Bertaux, campaigned for women’s entry into the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and for their eligibility to compete for the Prix de Rome art prize.

Tuca &amp; Bertie

Tuca &amp; Bertie is an American adult animated sitcom created by cartoonist Lisa Hanawalt that began streaming on May 3, 2019 on Netflix. It stars Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong, with a supporting cast including Steven Yeun, John Early, Richard E. Grant, and Reggie Watts. The first season received positive reviews, and was cited as one of the best shows of 2019 by several publications. The show's central characters are two anthropomorphic female birds: Tuca the toucan and Bertie the song thrush. Episodes mainly focus on the two's relationships with each other and with their peers.
The series was canceled by Netflix after one season in July 2019. In May 2020, Cartoon Network's nighttime Adult Swim programming block announced they ordered a second season of the series, which premiered on June 13, 2021. In August 2021, the series was renewed for a third season. "Tuca &amp; Bertie" has received largely positive critical reception for its portrayal of adulthood and friendship-driven themes, as well as its humor and art style.
Premise.
"Tuca &amp; Bertie" follows "the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca, a cocky, care-free toucan, and Bertie, an anxious, daydreaming songbird."
Production.
Development.
Tuca originated in Lisa Hanawalt's webcomic "Tuca the Toucan" which ran from 2013 to 2014. On February 20, 2018, Netflix announced it had given the production a series order to consist of a first season of ten episodes. The series was created by Lisa Hanawalt who executive produced alongside Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Noel Bright, Steven A. Cohen, and Tiffany Haddish. Production companies involved in the series include The Tornante Company and ShadowMachine. On March 14, 2019, Netflix announced that the series would premiere on May 3, and a first look featurette trailer was released.
Casting.
Alongside the initial series announcement, it was reported that Tiffany Haddish would voice the lead character of Tuca. On May 7, 2018, it was announced that Ali Wong had been cast as the voice of Bertie. In March 2019, it was announced Steven Yeun had been cast as a series regular, with Nicole Byer, Richard E. Grant, John Early, Reggie Watts, Tig Notaro, Amber Ruffin, Jermaine Fowler, and Tessa Thompson appearing in guest capacity.
Cancellation and revival.
Netflix cancellation.
Netflix announced the series cancellation on July 24, 2019. In a series of tweets responding to the news, Hanawalt expressed gratitude for the cast, crew, reviews, and fans. Hanawalt and Haddish both expressed hope that the show could find a new home.
The announcement of show's cancellation was met with a negative response. Within 24 hours of the cancellation, the Twitter hashtags #RenewTucaAndBertie and #SaveTucaAndBertie each received more than 10,000 tweets from users. A Change.org petition to renew the show gained media attention and received 3,600 signatures in 24 hours. Various news and lifestyle sites published columns lamenting the cancellation, while continuing to praise the show for its female representation, diverse cast, and handling of complex issues. The cancellation was deemed to be "disappointing" and a "loss for television".
The cancellation also led to criticism of Netflix's algorithm, highlighted by its failure to recommend the show to creator Hanawalt, and at Netflix itself for prematurely canceling the series less than three months after its premiere, disallowing the show a chance to grow its audience.
Adult Swim revival.
According to Hanawalt, several networks showed interest in picking up the show after its cancellation; however, she felt Adult Swim was the best home for the show to continue. On May 22, 2020, it was announced that the series would be revived on Adult Swim in 2021, making it the second Netflix original series to be revived coming off the cancellation of "One Day at a Time" in 2019. The revival was named one of Indiewire's "Most Anticipated TV Shows of 2021". On May 3, 2021, it was announced that the second season would premiere on June 13, 2021. The second season ran for ten episodes. On August 4, 2021, Adult Swim renewed the series for a third season.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Season 1.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first seasons holds an approval rating of 98% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Tuca &amp; Bertie" skips right past "BoJack Horseman"s shadow with its chipper sensibility and madcap sight gags, bringing plenty of laughs as it addresses adulting anxiety and exalts the joys of friendship." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews".
In a positive review, Kate Abbott of "The Guardian" wrote that the show was "a chirpily realised world that stays true to its experimentalism - and its pleasures are consistent, if deliciously twisted, and very surreal indeed." James Poniewozik of "The New York Times", praised "Hanawalt's surreal vision, the anarchic fluidity of the landscape, the series's whimsically bending laws of both nature and physics." Critics praised the show's female-focused portrayal of trauma, desire, and friendship. In a negative review, Brian Lowry of "CNN" wrote that the show did not stand out beyond similar adult animations on Adult Swim, declaring that the show was "strictly for the birds". The show drew both praise and criticism for perceived similarities to Comedy Central's "Broad City," due to both shows focusing on female friendship.
Season 2.
The second season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 8.29/10. The website's critical consensus states, ""Tuca &amp; Bertie" superb second season is as vivid and sparkling as the first, diving deeper into its dynamic leads without losing any of its singular humor." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". In a positive review, Dan Feinberg of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote "the show has become a savvy vehicle through which to explore repressed trauma, workplace sexism and what may be the most simultaneously nurturing and corrosive friendship on TV". Melanie McFarland of "Slate" praised the show for demonstrating "that shows created in and for the female gaze are inclusive and appealing to everybody" and "reminding us of the many ways that animation tells multi-dimensional stories that speak to everybody, not just the guys".
Awards and accolades.
Upon release, The A.V. Club thought that the show was one of the best new shows of 2019, with "Vox" naming "Tuca &amp; Bertie" one of the "5 best TV Shows of May 2019". The Huffington Post named it as 6th best show of 2019, Indiewire named it as the 2nd best new show of 2019 and the 20th best show of the decade, and TV Guide named it one of the best animated TV shows of the decade. In addition, the A.V. Club named it the 18th best show of 2019 and Junkee placed it on an unranked list of the best TV of 2019. Specific praise was given to the episode "The Jelly Lakes", with both "Entertainment Weekly" and "The Hollywood Reporter" naming it one of the best episodes of 2019.
"Tuca and Bertie" was nominated for three awards, winning one, at the 47th Annie Awards, all for the episode "The Jelly Lakes". It was nominated for Best General Audience Animated TV/Film and Outstanding Achievement for Voice Acting (for Ali Wong), and Outstanding Achievement for Writing (for Shauna McGarry). On January 25, 2020, McGarry won the Outstanding Achievement for Writing for "The Jelly Lakes".

Kalindi Pass

 Kalindi pass, or Kalindi khal is a high altitude mountain pass connecting Gangotri and Gastoli. It is situated at elevation and is arguably the most famous trekking pass of the Garhwal Himalaya.
The pass is heavily glaciated. The glacier west of the pass flows into the Gangotri Glacier which forms the source of the Ganges. 
History.
John Bicknell Auden mentioned this col in a report of his survey of the Garwhal himal in 1936.
"An easy col of 19,500 feet at the east end of the south-east branch of the Mana glacier, 4 miles to the east of which is the Saraswati valley"
but never climbed it as he needed to return the same way to Gangotri. Swami Probodhanandawas, inspired by John Bicknell Auden's account, organized the first Indian expedition to cross this pass. The expedition was undertaken in 1945 under the leadership of Swami Probodhananda and guidance of Dileep Singh who ascended the pass on July 22
Trekking.
Even though the Kalindi khal is the most famous trekking pas in the Garhwal Himalaya, it is nevertheless a challenging high altitude glacial trek.
Route.
The trek takes 6 days if already acclimatized. The trek is usually done in summer from mid-June to mid-September. An innerline permit is required.
Gomuk (4023 m) : A long distance over a broad and easy path along the ganges to the start of the Gangotri Glacier. It is gradual climb.
Vasuki Parvat (4800 m) : Hike up the moraines of the Gangotri Glacier after which a climb up to the Ghaumk glacier to the east begins. South of this glacier lie a few meadows named Vasuk Parvat.
Glacier camp (5200 m) : A strenuous climb over the morained filled glacier. Camping is in between the moraines
Kalindi base camp (5560 m) : The glacier splits up. The rout goes north to follow the Kalindi glacier.
River camp (4770 m) : The route stops following the main glacier and goes steep up toward Kalindi pass. On the other side the route goes down over a white glacier. Once off the glacier the route continues downstream till the first western side valley. The valley gets very broad here and camping spots are plenty. From this point onwards a trail should be visible.
Gastoli (3980) : The trail leads down valley along the southern bank of the stream. The valley terminates at the military outpost of Gastoli located alongside the Manna pass road.
Trekking &amp; Expedition ===
Kalindi khal pass trek that takes you half way round Garhwal from the Bhagirathi Valley to the Alaknanda Valley. A trip only for those who have done high altitude treks before; it’s very mention gives a thrill to even the most seasoned of climbers. Kalindi khal Pass Trekking is 5950mtrs, 19500feet above sea level, dividing the watersheds of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda river systems, discovered by Shipton and Tilman in 1934 (though legend exists of folk knowing the route from ages).
This 86 Km long trail connects two holy shrines of Gangotri and Badrinath over a glaciated pass almost at 6000 m. The walk is mostly over the moraines and the snow fields with deep crevasses and gives great opportunities to view the high altitude wildlife and camp by some small glacial lakes.

Maurice Ewing (surgeon)

Maurice Rossie Ewing, CBE, FRCSEd, FRCS, FRACS (6 July 1912 – 24 June 1999) was a Scottish surgeon who was the first professor of surgery at the University of Melbourne, Australia. His department established an early programme of renal transplantation in Australia.
Early life and education.
He was born on 6 July 1912 at 53 Dudley Crescent, Leith, the youngest of the four sons of Annabel (née Rossie) and Thomas Miller Ewing, master mariner and a captain with the Northern Lighthouse Board. He was educated at Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh where he was captain and dux of the school and a member of the school rugby 1st XV. He won the Creighton scholarship to University of Edinburgh Medical School and qualified with an MB ChB in 1935, winning the Ettles scholarship as the most distinguished scholar of his year, and the Mouan scholarship in the practice of physic.
Medical career.
He was house surgeon to Sir David Wilkie in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. After surgical posts at Royal Leicester Infirmary he returned to Edinburgh as a demonstrator in anatomy and physiology. After obtaining the FRCSEd in 1939, he was appointed surgeon to the Surgical Outpatient Department of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. During World War II he served as a Surgeon Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, based at the naval hospital in Bighi, Malta.
From 1947 he worked with Professor Ian Aird as senior lecturer at the Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital. During his time in London he was a Hunterian lecturer and won a travelling fellowship to Scandinavia. He was awarded a British Empire fellowship to Memorial Hospital, New York, where he worked with the leading head and neck surgeon Dr Hayes Marti n.
In 1955 he was appointed as first occupant of the new James Stewart chair of surgery at University of Melbourne. The chair which he took in Melbourne was based at the Alfred Hospital, then the Royal Melbourne Hospital, with the establishment of Monash University. He was also responsible for surgical teaching at St Vincent's Hospital and Prince Henry's Hospital.
At the Royal Melbourne he established a renal transplant program under the direction of the nephrologists Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith and Dr Vernon Marshall. Peter Morris set up a tissue typing laboratory and a research laboratory in transplantation immunology in Ewing's department to support this service. Ewing's s other clinical interests were in head and neck cancer, parenteral nutrition and peripheral vascular disease. He also introduced the practice of using sheepskins under the patient to reduce the incidence of pressure sores. He was active in promoting seatbelt legislation. The wearing of seatbelts in cars was made compulsory in the State of Victoria in 1970, a world first.
He retired in 1977 and was appointed a CBE in that year.
Following retirement from the University of Melbourne, he spent six months in Kuala Lumpur developing the academic surgical unit of the University of Malaya.
Personal life.
Ewing married Phyllis Edith Parnall, whom he had met in Malta where she was a Volunteer Air Detachment nurse. They had one daughter, Sarah, and two sons Hamish and Alastair.

Neural architecture search

Neural architecture search (NAS) is a technique for automating the design of artificial neural networks (ANN), a widely used model in the field of machine learning. NAS has been used to design networks that are on par or outperform hand-designed architectures. Methods for NAS can be categorized according to the search space, search strategy and performance estimation strategy used:
NAS is closely related to hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning and is a subfield of automated machine learning (AutoML).
Reinforcement learning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) can underpin a NAS search strategy. Zoph et al. applied NAS with RL targeting the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved a network architecture that rivals the best manually-designed architecture for accuracy, with an error rate of 3.65, 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than a related hand-designed model. On the Penn Treebank dataset, that model composed a recurrent cell that outperforms LSTM, reaching a test set perplexity of 62.4, or 3.6 perplexity better than the prior leading system. On the PTB character language modeling task it achieved bits per character of 1.214.
Learning a model architecture directly on a large dataset can be a lengthy process. NASNet addressed this issue by transferring a building block designed for a small dataset to a larger dataset. The design was constrained to use two types of convolutional cells to return feature maps that serve two main functions when convoluting an input feature map: "normal cells" that return maps of the same extent (height and width) and "reduction cells" in which the returned feature map height and width is reduced by a factor of two. For the reduction cell, the initial operation applied to the cell’s inputs uses a stride of two (to reduce the height and width). The learned aspect of the design included elements such as which lower layer(s) each higher layer took as input, the transformations applied at that layer and to merge multiple outputs at each layer. In the studied example, the best convolutional layer (or "cell") was designed for the CIFAR-10 dataset and then applied to the ImageNet dataset by stacking copies of this cell, each with its own parameters. The approach yielded accuracy of 82.7% top-1 and 96.2% top-5. This exceeded the best human-invented architectures at a cost of 9 billion fewer FLOPS—a reduction of 28%. The system continued to exceed the manually-designed alternative at varying computation levels. The image features learned from image classification can be transferred to other computer vision problems. E.g., for object detection, the learned cells integrated with the Faster-RCNN framework improved performance by 4.0% on the COCO dataset.
In the so-called Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a controller discovers architectures by learning to search for an optimal subgraph within a large graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the validation set's expected reward. The model corresponding to the subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Multiple child models share parameters, ENAS requires fewer GPU-hours than other approaches and 1000-fold less than "standard" NAS. On CIFAR-10, the ENAS design achieved a test error of 2.89%, comparable to NASNet. On Penn Treebank, the ENAS design reached test perplexity of 55.8.
Evolution.
Several groups employed evolutionary algorithms for NAS. Mutations in the context of evolving ANNs are operations such as adding a layer, removing a layer or changing the type of a layer (e.g., from convolution to pooling). On CIFAR-10, evolution and RL performed comparably, while both outperformed random search.
Hill-climbing.
Another group used a hill climbing procedure that applies network morphisms, followed by short cosine-annealing optimization runs. The approach yielded competitive results, requiring resources on the same order of magnitude as training a single network. E.g., on CIFAR-10, the method designed and trained a network with an error rate below 5% in 12 hours on a single GPU.
Multi-objective search.
While most approaches solely focus on finding architecture with maximal predictive performance, for most practical applications other objectives are relevant, such as memory consumption, model size or inference time (i.e., the time required to obtain a prediction). Because of that, researchers created a multi-objective search.
LEMONADE is an evolutionary algorithm that adopted Lamarckism to efficiently optimize multiple objectives. In every generation, child networks are generated to improve the Pareto frontier with respect to the current population of ANNs.
Neural Architect is claimed to be a resource-aware multi-objective RL-based NAS with network embedding and performance prediction. Network embedding encodes an existing network to a trainable embedding vector. Based on the embedding, a controller network generates transformations of the target network. A multi-objective reward function considers network accuracy, computational resource and training time. The reward is predicted by multiple performance simulation networks that are pre-trained or co-trained with the controller network. The controller network is trained via policy gradient. Following a modification, the resulting candidate network is evaluated by both an accuracy network and a training time network. The results are combined by a reward engine that passes its output back to the controller network.
One-shot models.
RL or evolution-based NAS require thousands of GPU-days of searching/training to achieve state-of-the-art computer vision results as described in the NASNet, mNASNet and MobileNetV3 papers.
To reduce computational cost, many recent NAS methods rely on the weight-sharing idea. In this approach a single supernetwork (also known as the one-shot model) is used as the search space where weights are shared among a large number of different sub-architectures that have edges in common, each of which is considered as a path within the supernet. The essential idea is to train one supernetwork that spans many options for the final design rather than generating and training thousands of networks independently. In addition to the learned parameters, a set of architecture parameters learn to prefer one module over another. Such methods reduce the required computational resources to only a few GPU days.
More recent works further combine this weight-sharing paradigm, with a continuous relaxation of the search space, which enables the use of gradient-based optimization methods. These approaches are generally referred to as differentiable NAS and have proven very efficient in exploring the search space of neural architectures.
Differentiable NAS has shown to produce competitive results using a fraction of the search-time required by RL-based search methods. For example, FBNet (which is short for Facebook Berkeley Network) demonstrated that supernetwork-based search produces networks that outperform the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve of mNASNet and MobileNetV2 on the ImageNet image-classification dataset. FBNet accomplishes this using over 400x "less" search time than was used for mNASNet. Further, SqueezeNAS demonstrated that supernetwork-based NAS produces neural networks that outperform the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve of MobileNetV3 on the Cityscapes semantic segmentation dataset, and SqueezeNAS uses over 100x less search time than was used in the MobileNetV3 authors' RL-based search.

Bryan Dauzat

Bryan K. Dauzat (pronounced "dough-zuh"; born November 30, 1959) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He competes part-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 28 Chevrolet Silverado for FDNY Racing. Dauzat has also competed in the ARCA Menards Series and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour in the past.
Racing career.
ARCA Racing Series.
In 2014, Dauzat made his ARCA Racing Series debut at Talladega, finishing 26th. He attempted to qualify for the season-opening race at Daytona the following year but did not make the race. In 2016, Dauzat ran the restrictor plate tracks and qualified but did not start at Kansas. 
For 2017, Dauzat teamed up with Bob Rahilly, owner of former Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team RahMoc Enterprises. He also acquired a car from JR Motorsports. He also invited prospect Calvin Carroll to test with the team at Daytona. Dauzat ran a career-high five races in 2017, running Daytona, Talladega, Pocono, Chicagoland and Kansas. He returned to Daytona in 2018 but was caught up in a wreck that also included Bo LeMastus and Quin Houff.
Truck Series.
Dauzat made his Camping World Truck Series debut at Bristol in 2014 with FDNY Racing, where he started and finished in the final position of the field, 36th, falling out due to suspension problems. He returned in 2017 to try to qualify for the season-opener at Daytona, but failed to qualify. In 2018, he returned once again to Daytona, where he finished 18th after being knocked out of the top ten in a late wreck in what was originally intended to be FDNY Racing's final race. However, on August 27, 2018, the team announced on its Facebook that they would run the Truck race at Talladega, and with Dauzat driving, the team achieved its first ever top-10 finish in 8th place.
During the season-opening 2019 NextEra Energy 250 at Daytona, Dauzat accidentally hit his jackman Billy Rock on pit road when his truck experienced braking problems. Rock was rushed to Halifax Health for his injuries and was diagnosed with a broken shoulder. He was released from the hospital shortly after.
Dauzat returned to FDNY and their No. 28 truck in 2020. He and the team ran more races than originally scheduled due to the fact that the field size for the Truck Series was expanded from 32 to 40 as a result of the cancellation of qualifying due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, he was in a crash with Tate Fogleman as the announcer said that "He was the fire department!"
On January 29, 2021, it was revealed that Dauzat would return for another part-time schedule in the FDNY No. 28 truck in 2021, beginning at the season-opener at Daytona. Dauzat entered the CRC Brakleen 150 at Pocono Raceway in June, the 14th race of the season, finishing 34th.
Personal life.
Dauzat serves as president of O. B. Builders, a sponsor of his racing career.

Sean Pollard (born March 22, 1991) is an Australian Paralympian who represented Australia in para-snowboarding at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, Korea.
Personal.
On 2 October 2014, Pollard was attacked by two sharks (possibly great whites) whilst surfing at Kelpids Beach, east of Esperance, Western Australia. He lost his left arm and right hand whilst fighting off the sharks. Before the attack he was an electrician, keen surfer and former South Bunbury footballer. In March 2015, more than $100,000 was raised by his local community in Bunbury, Western Australia to assist him on his new journey.
Career.
It was not until 2015 that Pollard encountered snow for the first time during a holiday in Canada. During the holiday, he tried snowboarding. After returning to Australia, he took part in an Australian Paralympic Committee specialist camp for Para-snowboarders with upper limb impairments. Pollard has mentioned that his previous surfing and skating skils have helped his transition into snowboarding.
In his first international season, he had several top 15 results including a sixth-place finish in the men's Snowboard Cross at the 2017 IPC Snowboard World Cup at Lake Tahoe, United States. At the 2016/17 IPC World Cup Finals in PyeongChang, South Korea, Pollard finished eight in the snow board cross and banked slalom.
At the 2018 Winter Paralympics, he competed in two snowboard events - fifth in the Men's Banked Slalom SB-UL and ninth in the Men's Snowboard Cross SB-UL.
At the 2019 World Para Snowboard Championships, Pyha, Finland, Pollard won the bronze medal in Men's Snowboard Cross UL and finished seventh in the Men's Banked Slalom UL.

Rufus G. King III

Rufus G. King III (born June 16, 1942) is the former chief judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.
Early life and career.
King was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
 He graduated from the Landon School in 1960. His father, Rufus King Jr., was a lawyer, but King majored in biology at Princeton University and planned to become a doctor. After graduating in 1966, King worked as a bailiff and docket clerk at the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions, soon to become the Superior Court. After briefly clerking for Judge Austin L. Fickling, King spent three years clerking for Judge William C. Pryor while attending law school at night at Georgetown University.
After graduating law school, King entered private practice. He was an associate at Karr &amp; Greensfelder from 1971 to 1973 and then spent four years as a solo practitioner. In 1977, he formed a partnership with his father, King &amp; King, which in 1979 became King &amp; Newmyer and then merged into Berliner &amp; Maloney in 1983. His practice included both civil and criminal litigation.
Judicial service.
In 1984, King was nominated and confirmed to be a judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. He served in most divisions of the court but primarily in the Civil Division, of which he became presiding judge in 1997. In 2000, King was named chief judge of the court. In that capacity, he worked to restructure the Family Division into a separate Family Court. He was reelected chief judge without opposition in 2004 and stepped down in 2008. The Washington Post credited him with improving court operations and improving public access to information, including by creating the court's first website. In 2008, King took senior status and began working in alternative dispute resolution with the McCammon Group.

College career.
After redshirting in 2014, Miller made his first career start at UCLA in 2015 after Conor McDermott was injured against California. Miller took over as starting tackle for UCLA from that game on. He later started the first five games of the 2016 season, but was injured against Arizona and was out for the rest of the season. After the 2017 season, Miller announced that he would declare for the 2018 NFL Draft.
Professional career.
At the NFL combine, Miller set a combine record for an offensive lineman with a 10'1" broad jump.
Miller was drafted by the Oakland Raiders with the 15th overall pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. On May 18, 2018, Miller signed a four-year rookie deal. He was named the Raiders starting left tackle to start the 2018 season, beating out veteran Donald Penn, who was moved to right tackle. In Week 5 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Miller allowed 3 sacks on quarterback Derek Carr in a 26–10 loss.
In week 6 against the Seattle Seahawks, Miller allowed another three sacks on Carr. In Week 8 against the Indianapolis Colts, Miller and the offensive line bounced back and did not allow a single sack in the game.
Despite the signing of veteran Trent Brown, head coach Jon Gruden announced that Miller would remain at left tackle with Brown moving to right.
Miller was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on October 22, 2020, and was activated two days later.
On April 2, 2021, Miller signed a three-year, $54.015 million contract extension with $42.6 million guaranteed with the Raiders, keeping him under contract through the 2025 season.

Tabitha Goldstaub

Tabitha Goldstaub is a British tech entrepreneur who specialises in communicating the impact of artificial intelligence. She is the co-founder of CognitionX, a market intelligence platform for AI.
Early life and education.
Goldstaub attended Bedales School, which she graduated in 2004. Her mother is Jane Procter, who edited Tatler magazine for nine years. She completed an Art Foundation in graphic design at Wimbledon College of Arts. She earned a bachelor's degree in Advertising at University of the Arts London.
Career.
After graduating, Goldstaub joined online television network t5m, where she became Director of Video Syndication. Here she spotted market space to "help rights holders, brands and influencers distribute and monetise their content". Goldstaub went on to co-found "Righster" (now Brave Bison) in 2011 with entrepreneur Charlie Muirhead. She held roles as head of brand solutions, head of fashion, marketing director and general manager of the New York office. In 2012 The Guardian partnered with Righster to improve their YouTube content. Righster floated in November 2013 for £20.4 million. She was key in organising the first instances of live streaming from London Fashion Week, with IMG and the British Fashion Council. In 2012 she was listed in Media Week's "30 Under 30". In 2014 she was listed in the London Evening Standard newspaper's "Silicon 60."
Goldstaub is the co-founder of CognitionX, “Expert Advice Platform”. This organisation was created with the intention to offer business the chance to learn about and use AI. Goldstaub is particularly concerned about AI's potential for gender bias, “When you look at what’s going on in AI with a feminist cap on, it becomes very apparent that the biases that already exist in society will be exacerbated or reinforced,”. In an interview with London Evening Standard, she compared AI to a child, "learning from what it hears...If you train AI based on racist, sexist information, you can’t be surprised that it becomes racist and sexist".
In June 2017, Goldstaub arranged the inaugural CogX, a two-day ‘Innovation Exchange’ for 1,500 delegates discussing how AI will shape the future of society. CogX 2018 saw 6,500 attendees and over 370 speakers at Tobacco Dock.
In October 2017 Marie Claire described Goldstaub as a Future Shaper. She was listed in the London Evening Standard's "The Progress 1000: London's most influential people". Goldstaub lives by the Karen Spärck Jones quotation "computing is too important to be left to men". She is represented by Curtis Brown (literary agents).
Goldstaub led the team that wrote a report for the Mayor of London’s Office, which analysed the AI ecosystem in London. The final report, which looks at London’s unique strengths as a global hub of AI, found that London was the AI capital of Europe; highlights include the fact that London hosts over 750 AI suppliers.
In June 2018 Goldstaub was named Head of the UK Government's AI Council (part of the government's new Office for Artificial Intelligence) and as 'AI Business Champion' by then Secretary of State for DCMS, Matt Hancock.
Education and advocacy.
Goldstaub co-founded Future Girl Corp with Sharmadean Reid in 2016. They offer a series of free monthly events promoting women's entrepreneurship. In March 2017, Goldstaub ran a Future Girl Corp lecture on creating user profiles for business. She regularly advises London based start-ups. Goldstaub is a mentor for young women tech founders, including Zoe Partridge of fashion rental startup We Are the Walk.
Goldstaub co-founded Project Placed, which looks to enhance experiential learning, by pairing students with businesses for experience-based learning during their university degrees, in 2017. That year she chaired the "Fixing Education For The AI Age" discussion at DLD Conference. She is on the Marketing Advisory Council for Founders 4 Schools, a UK Charity which connects students to local business leaders.
In October 2018 Goldstaub was awarded the Amy Johnson Inspiration Award by the Women's Engineering Society for using her positions in highly visible roles with government and the London mayor's office to promote diversity in tech.

Oaken Wood

Oaken Wood is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Maidstone in Kent. It is a Geological Conservation Review site.
Known locally as "Barming Wood" due to the village of Barming being the closest settlement to Oaken Woods, it is an ancient woodland with orchids, dormice, tawny owls, nightingales and many species of bat (alongside various other species). 
This site provides the best example of a very unusual topography, with cracking and tilting of underlying weaker strata during the Pleistocene by periglacial processes producing crests and troughs in the surface rocks.
A public footpath crosses the site.
In 2013, plans to uproot parts or all of Oaken Wood for a ragstone quarry were met with controversy due to its environmental importance (with various different species residing there) and its possibility in setting a legal precedent for up to 300 other ancient woodlands in the UK.

Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area

Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area is a heritage-listed former mining town and archaeological site on the reserve bounded by School Street, Cemetery Road, Railway Street and Burdekin Falls Dam Road, Ravenswood, Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016.
History.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area is situated south of Elphinstone Creek and to the west of School Street and Kerr Street, in the town of Ravenswood, about south of Townsville and east of Charters Towers. The Ravenswood goldfield was the fifth largest producer of gold in Queensland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its main mining periods, prior to modern open cut operations (1987 onwards), were: alluvial gold and shallow reef mining (1868-1872); attempts to extract gold from sulphide ores below the water table (); the New Ravenswood Company era (1899-1917); and small scale mining and re-treatment of old mullock heaps and tailings dumps (1919-1960s). In 2016 the Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area contains surface structures from eight mines: the Grand Junction, Little Grand Junction, Sunset No.1 and Sunset No.2, Deep, General Grant, Duke of Edinburgh, and Grant and Sunset Extended mines, as well as the mill associated with the Deep mine, and the Mabel Mill tailings treatment plant (most structures dating from the New Ravenswood Company era). It also includes remnants of two treatment plants (Partridge and Ralston's Mill, and Judge's Mill) from the 1930s; and the Chinese settlement area (1870s to the early 20th century, covering the first three mining periods at Ravenswood).
The place contains important surviving evidence of: ore extraction (from underground shafts) and metallurgical extraction (separation of gold from the ore) conducted on and near the Ravenswood goldfield's most productive reefs during the boom period of the town's prosperity (1900-1908); later attempts to re-treat the mullock heaps and tailings dumps from these mines; and Ravenswood's early Chinese community, which made an important contribution to the viability of the isolated settlement and was located along Deighton Street and Elphinstone Creek. The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area also has the potential to reveal evidence of early alluvial and shallow reef mining, as well as domestic living arrangements on the Ravenswood goldfield. It is an evocative reminder of the precarious and short-lived nature of north Queensland's mining booms, and has a special association with Archibald Lawrence Wilson, who established the New Ravenswood Company and improved both ore and metallurgical extraction processes on the goldfield.
Settlement and mining in north Queensland.
European settlement of the Kennedy Land District in north Queensland commenced with the founding of Bowen in 1861, and the spread of pastoralists through the hinterland. Pastoral stations were established up the valley of the Burdekin River, including "Ravenswood" and "Merri Merriwa". Townsville and Cardwell were both established north of Bowen in 1864.
However, mining, not pastoralism, proved to be the main catalyst for European settlement of north Queensland. In 1865 the founders of Townsville offered a reward for the discovery of a payable goldfield, and gold rushes occurred in the region from 1866. The first rush occurred at the Star River (inland from Townsville) in 1866. This was followed by a rush to the Cape River (near Pentland, southwest of Charters Towers) in 1867. Copper was also found on the Einasleigh River and at Cloncurry in the mid-1860s. Mining employed 19.8% of the north Queensland population in 1868, and 50% by 1876, before dropping to 15% in 1911. Although gold mining attracted people to north Queensland, alluvial finds of gold usually led to temporary townships, whereas underground reef mining held the promise of more stable and permanent settlements.
Alluvial gold and shallow reef mining (1868-72).
Alluvial gold was discovered south of the later site of Ravenswood, in tributaries of Connolly Creek on Merri Merriwa Station, north of the Burdekin River, in late 1868. One source claims the 1868 find was made by "Messrs Jessop, Buchanan and Party who were afterwards granted the then customary reward". However, another source credits W Crane and Party, who were directed to Connelly Creek by a Mr Curr (Merri Merriwa Station), and found payable gold in Tucker and Hungry Gullies (Creeks), later the site of Middle Camp - while stating that WH Buchanan, JF Jessop and EW Smith later made finds on tributaries of Elphinstone Creek, about April 1869. The Brisbane Courier later noted that Jessop and Party were rewarded £400 for discovering Upper Campwhile Crane and Party, the "original discoverers", only received £100. Prospectors soon established "Middle Camp" (later Donnybrook) on Tucker's Creek, and "Lower Camp" on Trieste Creek, with about 700 miners on the field by early 1869. Further north, in April 1869, the goldfield's richest alluvial discoveries were made in three dry creek beds close to the site of Ravenswood: Nolan's, Jessop's and Buchanan's gullies. Despite these finds, many miners soon left for the rush to the Gilbert River (over west of Townsville).
The parent reefs of the alluvial gold found in April were located about the same time as the exodus to the Gilbert - the General Grant being discovered first, followed by the Sunset. Both were visible above ground level, and both reefs would play an important part in the future prosperity of Ravenswood. The President Grant reef was one of the first two reefs discovered in 1869, along with the General Grant, but the President Grant is not shown on later maps (1900, 1903) of reefs in the area of the goldfield covered by this heritage recommendation. By 1872, the Sunset reef was the most productive reef on the field, with the General Grant in second place. In the next 40 years, nearly £3 million of gold would come from the reefs "in the little triangle between Buchanan's Gully [just east of Macrossan Street], Jessop's Gully [southwest of the town] and Elphinstone Creek".
Other reefs were soon found north of Elphinstone Creek, and in Nolan's Gully; and meanwhile, reefs had been discovered at Middle Camp. However, a lack of water meant that miners did not establish "Upper Camp" (later Ravenswood) near the General Grant and Sunset reefs until October 1869, after a storm temporarily resolved the water issue. By this time, most miners had returned from the Gilbert. The three camps on the goldfield had a population of 600 by January 1870, most in Upper Camp. Work was slowed by a lack of water, until rains in February 1870 enabled panning and sluicing, the results of which confirmed that Ravenswood was the first significant reef mining goldfield in the northern half of Australia.
However, the miners needed to crush the quartz ore to extract gold. The first machinery for this purpose, WO Hodkinson's five stamp crushing battery, the Lady Marion (or Lady Marian) Mill, was operational at Burnt Point (south of Upper Camp) from 18 April 1870. The first month's crushing results caused "an even greater "rush" than that … caused by the discovery of the alluvial gold". A second battery was operational in Upper Camp in August 1870, when the goldfield's population was about 1200.
Official recognition of the goldfield and settlement soon followed. The Queensland Government's geologist Richard Daintree visited Upper Camp in August 1870, and the Ravenswood goldfield (about 300 square miles) was proclaimed on 3 November 1870. By this time, the goldfield had a population of about 2000, and Upper Camp had 10 "public houses", with six public houses in Middle Camp.
The Government Surveyor, John von Stieglitz, arrived in November 1870, but was too late to impose a regular grid pattern on the settlement. Instead he formalised the existing plan, which was centred on the crossing of Elphinstone Creek by the main road (Macrossan Street), with tracks radiating out to the various diggings. Most commercial buildings were located along Macrossan Street. The resulting juxtaposition of mining, habitation and commerce gave the town its distinctive character.
The town was proclaimed on 19 May 1871, with an area of one square mile (259ha). This was later expanded to four square miles (1036ha) on 13 July 1883. Although gold had been discovered on Merri Merriwa Station, the name Ravenswood, after the run located further southeast, downstream on the Burdekin River, was preferred.
In 1871 the population of the goldfield was 900, with over half being in Upper Camp/Ravenswood, and by the end of 1871 there were five machines in Ravenswood. Hodgkinson's mill had been moved into town, to a site just north of Elphinstone Creek, and was renamed the Mabel Mill. In 1871 the town had 30 licensed hotels, although these were referred to as "shanties" and did not offer accommodation.
By this time Ravenswood also had a Chinese population, due to an influx of Chinese miners who had been forcefully evicted from the Western Creek diggings near Gilberton in mid-1871. At least three of the hotels of 1871 had Chinese licensees. The first Chinese had arrived in north Queensland in 1867, during the rush to the Cape River, and there were 200 Chinese looking for alluvial gold at Ravenswood in 1871.&lt;ref name="qhr-159/"&gt;Information supplied by Michael Brumby&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1872 it was estimated that there were about 1500 Chinese present on the Ravenswood goldfield, and a matching number of Europeans. Later, between 1880 and 1910, the Chinese population varied between 22.7% and 3.9% of the total population of the Ravenswood goldfield. As the Chinese focussed on alluvial gold, and also provided other services, they were tolerated at Ravenswood, because the Europeans were now focusing on reef mining. The quartz reefs were originally worked at shallow depths by means of a windlass (hand-wound rope and bucket), or a horse-powered whip or whim (using poles, ropes and pulleys) raising the ore from shallow shafts.
Extracting gold from sulphide ores ().
Despite its promising start, in 1872 the Ravenswood goldfield entered a "period of depression", as its most important mines reached the water table at about deep - starting with the Sunset in 1871, followed by the General Grant, Black Jack, and Melaneur in 1872. Although the oxidised quartz ('red stone' or "brown stone" quartz) close to the surface yielded its gold to traditional methods of mechanical crushing, below the water table the gold was in fine particles, which was not easily recovered by mechanical means. It was also mixed with sulphide ores; mainly iron sulphide (pyrite, or "mundic" ore) but also sulphides containing lead, copper, zinc, arsenic and antimony, which interfered with chemical treatments such as amalgamation (amalgamating the gold with mercury; then heating the resulting amalgam in a retort to vaporise the mercury) and chlorination (exposing roasted, concentrated ore to chlorine gas, and then precipitating gold out of the chloride solution). A process that worked on the ore from one reef might not work for an adjacent reef, due to a varying distribution of different types of sulphides. In addition, even if a process worked on a small scale, it could be uneconomical on a larger scale, given the price of transporting fuel to Ravenswood for smelting, or transporting concentrates for smelting elsewhere.
Once the mundic had been struck, "mining was 'worse than dull' as the field grappled with the realisation that to break below the waterline, the days of the individual miner were over and the time of companies was looming". The 1870s was a decade of major gold discoveries in Queensland, and miners keen on quick profits had plenty of new goldfields from which to choose. Many miners joined the rushes to Charters Towers (1872) and the Palmer River (1873). Many Chinese departed from Ravenswood for the Palmer River. Charters Towers soon overtook Ravenswood as the most important inland town in north Queensland; and the Hodgkinson rush (southwest of Port Douglas) in 1876 also drew away miners.
However, Ravenswood grew during the 1870s and 1880s, despite the goldfield's "refractory" ores, and "mundic problem". The goldfield had a population of 950 in 1877 (with 50 Chinese), rising to 1100 in 1880 (including 250 Chinese), and 2000 in 1883 (including 300 Chinese; with 190 working the alluvial, and 10 quartz miners). In 1877 there were 25 Chinese working as alluvial miners on the Ravenswood goldfield, along with 400 European quartz (reef) miners - out of a total of 13,269 Chinese and 4,634 European gold miners in Queensland. 13,000 of those Chinese miners were on the Palmer River goldfield, but that year it was also reported that up to 200 Chinese had arrived in Ravenswood from the Palmer, Cooktown and other northern towns.
The 1877 Pugh's Almanac listed one Chinese hotelkeeper (out of seven hotelkeepers) in Ravenswood, and one Chinese storekeeper. The Chinese, as well as working alluvial claims and operating hotels and stores, were employed as wage labour in some mines; worked as roasters and chlorinators at the Mabel Mill; and operated 24 licensed market gardens on the Ravenswood goldfield in 1883. There were 27 gardens altogether, with a total area of 82 acres. By 1885 there were 37 gardens, all operated by Chinese, with an area of 105 acres. Chinese gardens were vital in providing fresh vegetables to north Queensland's goldfield populations.
For 19th century diasporic Chinese communities such as Ravenswood's, the establishment of specific cultural settlement areas, or "Chinatowns", that "provided a range of sacred and secular services, including temples, stores and accommodation", was an important aspect of community building. Deighton Street, west of Macrossan Street, was the centre of Chinese life in Ravenswood. There were two eating houses close to Macrossan Street's bridge across Elphinstone Creek, in the 1870s; and market gardens were located between Deighton Street and Elphinstone Creek, as well as north of Elphinstone Creek, interspersed amongst several crushing machine operations. There was also a temple south of Deighton Street. Temples were not just places of religious worship; rather, they were an integral part of a Chinese village. "They were places to meet, to check one's horoscope before embarking on a new venture and places where ancestors were venerated." As well as being a place where the community could worship at any time, major gatherings were held at temples on festival days, with feasts and processions. The Ravenswood temple appears on an 1874 survey plan, making it the earliest known Chinese temple in Queensland. Temples were later built at towns including: Cooktown (1877), The Palmer (c.1878), Port Douglas (), Cairns (1886), Breakfast Creek in Brisbane (1886), Etheridge/Georgetown (1891), Croydon (1897), and Atherton (1903). The nearby pig roasting oven is also a rare example of its type, and demonstrates the usual spatial arrangement of temple and oven, for community feasts. Another example of a pig oven is found at Croydon, while the site of a pig oven is visible in Atherton. It has been suggested that Chinese pig ovens may be a phenomenon only found in Chinese migrant communities in Australia and New Zealand and may reflect practices from specific localities in China.
Ravenswood continued to develop during the 1880s. By 1885, the Ravenswood goldfield had an estimated population of 2294 Europeans and 227 Chinese, with 1490 Europeans and 148 Chinese located in Ravenswood itself. Ravenswood at this time had four Chinese storekeepers, and two Chinese produce merchants, but all six hotel licensees were European. The Ravenswood National School, which opened in temporary buildings in late 1873, and in its own buildings in 1874. had an average attendance of 110 students in 1878, and reached its peak enrolment of 390 by 1889.
The 1880s were also a period of experimentation in metallurgical (gold extraction) technology. In 1883, the only method for dealing with sulphide ores was stamper mills and rotary buddles (which used water and gravity to separate and concentrate the crushed ores), but later Ravenswood "was the first place where the chlorination process and Wilfley tables [developed 1896, to shake the ore and separate out different sized particles] were used in Queensland, and probably the first place where the cyanide process [dissolving fine gold in a cyanide solution, and later precipitating the gold out of the solution] for extracting gold was used in Australia". Other techniques attempted included fine grinding (using ball mills), roasting (burning off the sulphides), and smelting (prohibitively expensive, as it required high temperatures and thus a lot of fuel). By 1888 a new company at One Mile Creek, formed by Duncan and Peter Macintyre, had adapted an abandoned Cassell's patent plant (a version of the chlorination process which was applied and failed in Ravenswood in 1886), to work on a "secret process" (cyaniding).
Ravenswood mining continued to be viable, although only a (fluctuating) percentage of the gold was being recovered from the ore. In the mid-1880s there was even a temporary increase in the goldfield's production, due to good returns from the Sandy Creek mines on the John Bull reef. For the next eight years, the principal producers of the district were the General Grant, Sunset, New England, Wild Irish Girl, Melaneur and John Bull reefs, plus the silver lodes of the One Mile (at Totley).
Ravenswood's economy survived the 1880s due to the development of silver mines at Totley Township established about north of Ravenswood. The silver mines opened , and Richard King floated the Ravenswood Silver Mining Company Ltd in 1882 - the year of Ravenswood's lowest gold production between 1878 and 1898. Silver prices were high during the 1880s, and the Totley mines encouraged the Queensland Government to approve a branch railway line (off the Northern Railway between Townsville and Charters Towers) to Ravenswood in 1882 (completed 1884). The railway meant that some gold ores could be crushed, concentrated and sent for treatment at the Aldershot works just north of Maryborough or overseas to Swansea, in Wales. However, all silver mining had stopped by 1891, due to falling silver prices and over-expenditure on treatment plants.
Gold mining at Ravenswood continued during the 1880s and 1890s. Hugh Hawthorne Barton, who had operated Brothers Mill on Elphinstone Creek from the late 1870s, took over the General Grant, Sunset and Black Jack mines, and the Mabel Mill (and later the Melaneur and Duke of Edinburgh mines), and floated the Ravenswood Gold Mining Company in 1887, with £100,000 in capital. The General Grant, Sunset and Black Jack mines, and the Mabel Mill had previously been operated by the Ravenswood Gold Smelting Company, floated in London in 1884. This company utilised Chinese workers to hand pick ore prior to processing. From 1884 to 1896 Barton's group was the largest and most successful operation in Ravenswood, its profitability assisted by the railway, economies of scale, and flexibility in ore-treatment methods. Barton utilised roasting, chlorination (by 1889), and smelting, and employed Chinese workers at the Mabel Mill. Along with their market gardens along Elphinstone Creek, Chinese employment at the Mabel Mill also influenced the location of the Chinese settlement area in Ravenswood. Meanwhile, the landscape was being altered by mining. The need for timber for boilers and for timbering-up mine shafts led to the loss of native trees in the locality, and goats also helped shape the landscape by eating regrowth.
By the mid-1890s, Barton was in debt to the Queensland National Bank, and his properties were seized in 1896, with the General Grant, Black Jack and Mabel Mill being let on tribute (where a party of miners worked a mine, while giving the mine owner a percentage of any results) in 1897. The tributers refused to employ Barton's experienced Chinese workers at the Mabel Mill, leading to disastrous attempts at chlorination. However, the goldfield's production was boosted in the late 1890s when work resumed on the Donnybrook reefs for the first time in 20 years, and the Hillsborough (Eight Mile) reefs were taken up.
The New Ravenswood Company era (1899-1917).
Ravenswood's boom period of gold production (, with 1905 the year of highest production) is reflected in the town's surviving mining infrastructure and commercial and public buildings. This boom occurred due to the efforts of Archibald Laurence Wilson (1852-1935). After gaining a diploma in mining engineering in Edinburgh, and working in New Zealand and on the Palmer River, Wilson arrived in Ravenswood in 1878. He was publican of the Silver King Hotel in Totley in the 1880s. As manager of the John Bull mine at Sandy Creek in the mid-1890s, he raised capital in London and installed a cyanide plant.
Wilson later travelled to London in 1898, where he floated both the Donnybrook Blocks Mining Syndicate and the New Ravenswood Company in 1899. Wilson was the general manager of both companies, under their London directorates. Until 1917, the New Ravenswood Company was the largest mining operation on the Ravenswood goldfield. Registered with a capital of £50,000, the company purchased the General Grant, Sunset, Black Jack, Melaneur, and Shelmalier mines, and the Mabel Mill, from the Queensland National Bank (and later obtained the Saratoga, Duke of Edinburgh and London North mines), and initiated a new era in ore and metallurgical extraction. Using British capital, Wilson introduced modern machinery to work the mines, and effectively reshaped Ravenswood's landscape. Wilson was known as "the uncrowned king of Ravenswood". He was also Chairman of the Ravenswood Shire Council for some years, and was later on the Dalrymple Shire Council, until he resigned from poor health in 1934.
From 1900, both the Sunset and General Grant (also known as the Grant) mines were redeveloped by Wilson. These became the key earners for the New Ravenswood Company; by 1903 the two mines employed about 205 men, and were "the "backbone" of [the] town".
The Sunset reef, which runs roughly northwest-southeast through the Ravenswood Mining Landscape, was the largest producer on the goldfield (almost a quarter of the total). It produced 14,722oz of gold from 1870 to 1894, and by 1900 it was worked from an underlie (an inclined shaft, following the dip of a reef) branching off from a vertical shaft deep. It was stated at this time that the reef had "much the same history as the General Grant, the two being generally worked together". By 1903 the New Ravenswood Company had extended the underlie shaft right up to the surface, where a headframe was constructed to haul ore directly up the slope. The Sunset's yield of "free gold" (pure gold not combined with other minerals), which could be extracted at the Mabel Mill, peaked in 1904, then fell slowly. In 1905 an average of 170 men were employed at the mine. In 1908 the reef was being worked by the main underlie shaft, deep (Sunset No.1); and a vertical shaft, deep (Sunset No.2). As the Sunset reef was worked in conjunction with the General Grant and the Duke of Edinburgh reefs in the New Ravenswood Company era, its exact total production of gold is hard to calculate; but from 1876 to 1912 the reef probably produced about 177,000oz of gold; and probably most of the 22,000oz that the company extracted from 1912 to 1917.
The General Grant, one of the most productive reefs on the goldfield, running roughly north-south just east of the Sunset reef, was worked almost continuously to the late 1880s, and periodically thereafter. By 1895 returns had diminished, due to the small size of the reef and its highly refractory ore. In 1900, the General Grant had a vertical shaft to , and then an underlie of , the bottom of the latter being below the level of the shaft mouth; but operations were "almost completely suspended" as the New Ravenswood Company concentrated on the Sunset reef. The underlie was long by 1908. To 1900 the General Grant had produced 23,651oz of gold; and after crushing of ore from the mine resumed at the beginning of 1903, it was treated with ore from the Sunset. On average, 40 men were employed on the mine in 1905. In 1908 the power house for both the Sunset and the General Grant mines was situated on the General Grant lease, with three Cornish boilers. By 1912 the General Grant had produced about 36,000oz of gold.
To the east of the General Grant was the Duke of Edinburgh reef, running roughly northwest-southeast. This was one of the early reefs discovered on the goldfield; and in 1872 it was identified by Warden TR Hackett as one of the 28 principal reefs. The Duke of Edinburgh was a prospecting claim by 1870. It was worked in several episodes prior to the 1890s, and was re-opened in 1891, producing 1286oz of gold during 1891-95. In 1908 the mine was taken over by the New Ravenswood Company, and was reorganised as an underlie shaft with haulage machinery from the Golden Hill mine, being worked in conjunction with the General Grant until 1917.
Along with his modernisation of the goldfield's best mines, Wilson also abandoned chlorination at the Mabel Mill, increased the mill's crushing capacity to 30 stamps (by 1904), and introduced the first Wilfley tables to Queensland. Crushing resumed in January 1900. Wilson improved metallurgical extraction by "postponing amalgamation of the free gold till the great bulk of the sulphides [had] been removed by concentration". The ore was crushed in stampers without using mercury. Then, using the Wilfley tables, the heavier Galena (lead sulphide ore) and free gold was separated from the lighter sulphides. The free gold and galena was then ground in Berdan pans with mercury, while the remaining sulphides (containing iron, zinc and copper) were dispatched to the Aldershot works (near Maryborough) for smelting. In 1902-3, a raff wheel, in diameter, was built at the Mabel Mill to lift tailings (post-treatment residue) up to a flume, which carried them over to the south side of Elphinstone Creek, where they could be treated with cyanide. The cyanide works (of which remnants still remain south of Elphinstone Creek) was erected . The cyanide works were not erected by September 1903, but there is a reference to a "second treatment works" at the New Ravenswood mill in 1904. The new treatment works was expected to begin work in October 1904. A long girder bridge was constructed across the creek to carry steam water pipes and electric cable from the Mabel Mill to the new works, which eventually comprised two Krupp ball mills and 12 tables.
Due to the New Ravenswood Company's efforts, the goldfield's production increased between 1899 and 1905. Gold recovery increased from 18,016oz in 1899 to 24,832oz in 1900 and to 42,465oz in 1905. The New Ravenswood Company paid impressive 50% dividends to its shareholders in 1901, 1902 and 1904; and 75% in 1903.
The productivity of Ravenswood's mines during the New Ravenswood Company era was also reflected in the goldfield's population, which rose from 3420 in 1901 to its peak of 4707 in 1903. The 1903 population included 215 Chinese, 89 of these being alluvial miners. Although these figures are given for the "Ravenswood Gold Field and Mining Districts", a figure of 1862, from the 1901 census, was given as the population of the town of Ravenswood. In 1905 two Chinese were listed as "storekeepers and grocers".
The population increase led to a building boom in the first decade of the 20th century. Hundreds of new houses, the town's first two brick hotels - the Imperial Hotel and the Railway Hotel () - as well as brick shops such as Thorp's Building (1903), and the brick Ravenswood Ambulance Station (1904) were constructed in this period; the use of brick being spurred by the threat of fire. The New Ravenswood Company also rebuilt the mining landscape in and around the town, with expansion of the Mabel Mill, and new headframes and winders, magazines, boilers and brick smokestacks erected beside all the principal shafts.
However, not all Wilson's ventures in this period were successful. In 1902 he floated Deep Mines Ltd, with a capital of £100,000, to sink a shaft east of the New Ravenswood Company's leases. This mine (also within the Ravenswood Mining Landscape) was an ambitious attempt to reach a presumed intersection of the General Grant and Sunset reefs at depth. Using the capital raised, Wilson built a model mine and mill. The shaft was started in late 1902-early 1903, and construction work on the buildings and machinery was completed later in 1903. The mine reached , the deepest on the goldfield, with extensive crosscutting and driving, but only about 240oz of gold was recovered. No ore was crushed at all in 1908. By 1910 a new shaft was being sunk "near the western boundary"; but the mine was abandoned in 1911, and never worked again. Wilson's London investors lost at least £65,000.
The Deep's mill, built nearby and operational by 1906, was a smaller version of the Mabel Mill, with gravity stamps, Wilfley tables, and a cyanide plant. Its site, adjacent to the mine, ran counter to the normal practice of siting mills near water courses. With the failure of the Deep mine, it milled ore from other mines until about 1917.
Another mine, the Grand Junction, was located north of the New Ravenswood Company's most productive mines, in the Ravenswood Mining Landscape. The Grand Junction Consolidated Gold Mining Company was formed in 1900, and a shaft was sunk in 1901 (probably the No.1 shaft on the Grand Junction Lease No.520). In 1902 another exploration "deep shaft" (No.2) was sunk at the southwest boundary of the Grand Junction Lease No.503. A 1903 map shows No.2 shaft was on the southwest boundary of the Grand Junction holding, and No.1 shaft was in the eastern half of the holding. The Grand Junction mine was another failed attempt to locate a presumed junction of the General Grant and Sunset reefs at depth; by 1908 it was owned by the New Ravenswood Company. The mine was apparently closed by 1906. Total production was about 425oz of gold.
Slightly more successful was the Grant and Sunset Extended mine, at the southern end of the Ravenswood Mining landscape. This was a deep shaft sunk by the Grant and Sunset Extended Gold Mining Company, a Charters Towers-owned company with Wilson as its local director. During the 19th century, small mines had been operated in the Rob Roy reef, to the southeast. The Grant and Sunset Extended was floated in 1902, the intent being to locate the General Grant and Sunset reefs south of Buck Reef. The plant and buildings of the Yellow Jack mine, southeast of Ravenswood, were re-erected on the site. The shaft was down in by 1908, with 50 men employed at the mine by the later date. The mine closed by 1910, but was worked on tribute until 1917, with about 15,000oz of gold obtained over 1904-18. The mine was worked on tribute by James Judge and party until at least 1911.
The boom period at Ravenswood did not last. As well as losing money on the Deep and Grand Junction mines, the New Ravenswood Company faced the closure of the Aldershot works in 1906, and declining yields from 1908 to 1912. Although Wilson experimented with flotation (agitating crushed ore in oil and water, and extracting fine gold particles on the surface of air bubbles) and cyanide processes at the Mabel Mill, it was too late to save his company. The Shelmalier had closed by 1904, the Black Jack in 1909, and the Melaneur in 1910. By that year, the General Grant, Sunset, Duke of Edinburgh and London North (obtained 1910) were the New Ravenswood Company's only producing mines.
Few new buildings were constructed in Ravenswood after 1905. The hospital closed in 1908. That year the goldfield's population consisted of 4141 Europeans (including 2625 women and children) and 181 Chinese (including 94 alluvial miners). This dropped to 2581, including 92 Chinese, by 1914. A 1913 list of 52 Chinese men, women and children in Ravenswood included two housewives, seven children, 22 fossickers, 10 gardeners, 4 carters, 3 bakers, 2 storekeepers, and one each of a cook and bookkeeper.
Increased costs and industrial disputes in the 1910s hastened the end of the New Ravenswood Company era. During a miner's strike between December 1912 and July 1913, over lay-offs, the fresh vegetables and business loans provided by Ravenswood's Chinese community helped keep the town going. Although the miners won, it was a hollow victory, as the company could only afford to re-employ a few of the men. World War I (1914–18) then increased labour and material costs for the New Ravenswood Company. The London North mine closed in 1915, and on 24 March 1917 the New Ravenswood Company ceased operations; ending large-scale mining in Ravenswood for the next 70 years.
By 1917, the Ravenswood goldfield had produced over 850,000oz of gold (nearly a quarter coming from the Sunset mine), and 1,000,000oz of silver. According to a table on Ravenswood's gold production, total production to 1917 inclusive was 865,054oz of gold (154,094oz to the end of 1877 and 254,213oz from 1878 to 1899 and 456,747oz from 1900 to 1917, making it the fifth largest gold producer in Queensland, after Charters Towers, Mount Morgan, Gympie and the Palmer goldfield. Ravenswood was also the second largest producer of reef gold in north Queensland, after Charters Towers. By the end of 1928 Ravenswood had produced 885,805oz by comparison, production at Charters Towers and the Cape River field by this time was 6,673,398oz, Rockhampton and Mount Morgan: 5,099,570oz, Gympie: 3,388,855oz, and the Palmer: 1,329,666oz. The next biggest producer after Ravenswood was Croydon, at 770,947oz. Other goldfield production included: Eidsvold: 97,742oz, Etheridge, Oaks and Woolgar: 627,481oz&lt;, Hamilton: 46,050oz, Hodgkinson (to end of 1908, then included in Chillagoe): 229,706oz, Chillagoe (from 1909) 36,825oz&lt;, Mount Coolon: 35,156oz&lt; and a total from Cloncurry, Calliope, Clermont, Paradise, Normanby and other small fields of 844,476oz.
Small scale mining and re-treatment (1919-60s).
After 1917 the Ravenswood goldfield entered a period of hibernation, with intermittent small-scale attempts at mining. In 1919, Ravenswood Gold Mines Ltd took over some of Wilson's leases and renovated the Deep mine's mill, but obtained poor returns. In 1922, 680 tons of material was gathered up at the Deep's mill site, and was reduced locally to 16 tons of concentrates, worth £594. Ravenswood Gold Mines also worked the Duke of Edinburgh from to 1930, with good returns reported in 1924. Ravenswood Gold Mines worked the Duke of Edinburgh from that mine's underlie, and the No.4 Grant shaft. The General Grant and Sunset were also worked on a small scale from 1919–21, while the Mabel Mill continued to provide crushing services for the limited local mining.
Consequently, Ravenswood's population declined and the town shrank physically. In 1921 the town's population fell below 1000, and by 1923 there were 530 people left, including 8 Chinese. Pugh's Almanacs for 1923 and 1927 list a population of 1800 for Ravenswood, yet by 1925, there were only about 609 people in the whole district, including 5 Chinese. During the 1920s, prior to the closure of the railway branch line to Ravenswood in 1930. Ravenswood was the first Queensland town to lose its railway with hundreds of the town's timber buildings were dismantled and railed away. By 1927, only the two brick hotels remained operating as hotels. The Ravenswood Shire was absorbed into the Shire of Dalrymple in 1929, and by 1934 only 357 people remained in the town. In 1935, the population was 451 - presumably for the whole goldfield.
Despite this decline, some gold was still being extracted. There was a small increase in gold production between 1923 and 1927. A total of 16,130oz was produced in 1938. The Duke of Edinburgh was the largest producer on the field in 1927, and due to the gold price rise of the 1930s, some mines were re-worked and efforts were also made to treat the old mullock heaps (waste rock from mining) and tailings dumps with improved cyanide processes. Between 1931 and 1942, 12,253oz of gold was obtained from the goldfield, the peak year being 1940.
A number of companies were active in Ravenswood in the 1930s-early 1940s. In 1933, the North Queensland Gold Mining Development Company took up leases along Buck Reef and reopened the Golden Hill mine, and the following year their operations were taken over by Gold Mines of Australia Ltd. The 1870s Eureka mine (near the Imperial Hotel) was revived by James Judge in 1934. In 1935 the Ravenswood Concentrates Syndicate began re-treating the Grant mullock heaps in the remaining stampers at the Mabel Mill, and dewatering the Sunset No.2 shaft; while the Sunset Extended Gold Mining Company, with James Judge as manager, dewatered the Grant and Sunset Extended shafts (which connected to the Sunset, General Grant and Duke of Edinburgh shafts), and re-timbered the Grant and Sunset Extended, General Grant, and Sunset underlie (No.1) shafts. Work on the Sunset underlie (No.1) shaft had commenced in 1934. The London North mine was reopened by RJ Hedlefs in 1937, and Basque miners were working the Sunset No. 2 shaft at this time.
The Little Grand Junction mine, located at the intersection of Siggers Street and School Street, on the old Grand Junction Lease No.520, The Little Grand Junction mine is close to the site of the Grand Junction mine's No.1 shaft. was operated from 1937-1942 by local miners Henry John Bowrey and John Thomas Blackmore. The 1937 operation closed in 1942. Five men were employed at the mine in 1940. The shaft had apparently been sunk previously by the Grand Junction Consolidated Gold Mining Company; and Bowrey and Party reconditioned it and extended the existing workings.
In 1938, Archibald and Heuir set up a mill on the bank of One Mile Creek to treat mullock dumps, and the Ravenswood Gold Mining Syndicate (formed 1937, with James Judge as manager) began treating the mullock dumps of the Sunset mine in late 1938. The same syndicate also dewatered and reopened part of the Grant and Sunset Extended; and the Grand Junction mine was reopened by Judge . It was reported that the Grand Junction Consolidated mine was reopened briefly in 1941 by a Townsville syndicate.
The Ravenswood Gold Mining Syndicate's (Judge's) mill initially consisted of 10 head of stamps obtained from the Mother Lode Mill at Mount Wright (northwest of Ravenswood), powered by a diesel engine. The ore was crushed by the stamper battery, concentrated with Wilfley tables, and then either treated with cyanide or sent to the Chillagoe smelters. Initial success with some rich ore led to enlargement of the mill to 30 stamps in 1939-1940. The annual report for 1940 claimed the mill had been expanded to 30 head of stamps during 1940, but work was reportedly also underway on the expansion in late 1939. A Stirling boiler and a 250 hp engine were also obtained from the Burdekin meatworks (Sellheim), and a rock breaker, elevator and conveyor were installed. However, the upgraded mill proved to be overpowered and required a lot of timber fuel; the brick foundations used for the machinery were not strong enough; and the best ore from the Sunset had already been treated, so the mill closed early in 1942 and the plant was moved to Cloncurry.
Also in 1938, Maxwell Partridge and William Ralston installed a new plant south of Elphinstone Creek, to the immediate west of the Mabel Mill's old cyanide works, to re-treat the old tailings with cyanide. A ball mill, filter and other plant were purchased from the Golden Mile, Cracow in 1939, while later that year a suction gas engine and flotation machine were also installed. This operation closed , and the coloured sands on the site today are residues from the flotation process: the yellow sand is from the flotation of iron pyrites; the grey sands are copper tailings; and the black material is zinc tailings.
There was limited activity on the goldfield in the late 1940s to early 1960s. The Empire Gold Mining Syndicate treated mullock dumps from The Irish Girl, London, and Sunset mines from 1946 to 1949, as well as some of the dumps from the Grand Junction (1947). The Duke of Edinburgh mine was briefly reopened by Cuevas and Wilson in 1947, and the Cornish boilers on the site (one with the maker's mark 'John Danks &amp; Son Pty Ltd makers Melbourne) may relate to this (unsuccessful) operation. John Danks and Son Pty Ltd began as a plumbing business in 1859. In 1889 John Danks and Son Limited was formed and in 1951 it became a subsidiary of Danks Holdings Limited. Percy Kean reopened the Great Extended mine at Totley in 1947, and later purchased Partridge's mill in 1951 to use it as a flotation plant to treat the silver-lead ore from Totley, adding a diesel engine, stonebreaker, Wilfley tables and classifier. The Totley mines closed in 1954, although the Great Extended mine was briefly sub-leased by Silver Horizons No Liability, in 1964. Partridge's mill was closed .
Other attempts were made in the early 1950s to rework old sites. A Townsville syndicate led by Leslie Cook and George Blackmore reopened the Grand Junction mine in 1951, but it soon closed. James Judge also recommenced gold mining at Donnybrook, but closed in 1954; while 900 tons of tailings from the Deep mine's mill site were taken for re-treatment at Heuir's cyanide plant in the early 1950s.
A new industry.
In the 1960 and 1970s, Ravenswood's population shrank to its nadir of about 70 people. At the same time, there was a growing nostalgic interest in old towns in Australia. In 1968 the landscape of Ravenswood was described in romantic terms: "Mute testimonials are the numerous mullock heaps which dot the countryside; the rusty remains of steam engines; stampers which were used to crush stone; and collapsed cyanide vats… Derelict poppet-heads…stand above deep, abandoned shafts. Colossal columns of chimney stacks rise majestically from the entanglement of rubber vines and Chinese apple trees." Some locals realised that preserving the town's surviving historic buildings and structures was necessary to attract tourists and create a new local industry.
From this time onwards the town's mining heritage was seen as an asset. The National Trust of Queensland met with locals in 1974, and a conservation plan for the town was published in 1975. Later, the town sites of Totley and Ravenswood were both entered into the National Trust of Queensland Register. Comments from an International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) trip to northern Australia in 1978 included "[Ravenswood]…is one of the most evocative (gold towns of Australia) and this must be preserved. A policy of "all that is necessary but as little as possible" must be strongly pursued". The increased population of north Queensland, longer paid holidays, improved roads and the rise of car ownership after World War II, all increased visitation to Ravenswood, as did the completion of a road past Ravenswood to the Burdekin Dam, in the 1980s. As a result, the town and its mining landscape have been represented in brochures, art and photography. In particular, the landmark qualities of the tall brick chimneys are a distinctive feature in representations of Ravenswood.
Modern operations.
However, gold mining recommenced at Ravenswood in the 1980s, due to a rise in the gold price and the efficiencies gained from open cut mining and modern cyanide metallurgical extraction processes, in which the ore is finely ground in rotary mills, before being treated in a sodium cyanide solution and the gold is extracted using granulated activated carbon. From 1983-86 the Northern Queensland Gold Company Ltd conducted agglomeration heap-leaching (spraying a sodium cyanide solution on previously mined material heaped on a plastic membrane), in the process removing a landmark tailings dump at King's mine in Totley, and mullock heaps from the Grant and Sunset mines. In 1987 Carpentaria Gold commenced open cut mining of the Buck reef (the Buck Reef West pit) near the old Grant and Sunset mines on the south side of the town. Later, pits were dug further east along the reef. Some underground mining was also undertaken from the Buck Reef West pit until 1993, which broke into the old workings of the General Grant, Sunset, and Duke of Edinburgh mines. The old headframe at the Grant and Sunset Extended was demolished in 1988, and replaced with a new steel headframe, which was used until 1993 and then removed. The Melaneur-Shelmalier-Black Jack-Overlander reef complex, on the north side of the town, was mined as an open cut 1990-91, before being backfilled as a golf course. The Nolan's Gully open cut commenced in 1993.
Although modern mining revived the economy of the town, it did not replicate the building boom of the early 20th century.
The heritage significance of Ravenswood's surviving mining infrastructure was recognised in a 1996 Queensland Mining Heritage Places Study by Jane Lennon &amp; Associates and Howard Pearce; and a 2000 Conservation Management Plan by Peter Bell. In 2006, the population of Ravenswood, the oldest surviving inland town in north Queensland, was 191.
Description.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area occupies an area of approximately 50ha in the north Queensland town of Ravenswood. Bounded by Elphinstone Creek to the north and west, and School Street and Kerr Street to the east, the landscape consists of an expanse of undulating modified ground punctuated by mullock heaps, tall brick chimneys and other scattered ruins. There are 12 former mine and mill sites dispersed across the area, and Chinese sites including a temple and associated pig roasting oven are concentrated in the vicinity of Deighton Street to the north (shown on the site map).
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area is surrounded to the north, west and east by Ravenswood township. Significant buildings adjoining the landscape include Ravenswood School and Residence, Ravenswood Ambulance Station, and the Railway Hotel. An active mining area around the Buck Reef West open cut (1987) occupies the southern extents of the historical mining landscape.
While individual ruins have been subject to deterioration, they continue to illustrate characteristics of their former function. Collectively they are a physical legacy of the complex and innovative history of mining in the area. Elements that have been relocated or adapted for modern use are of lesser significance than in-situ elements; however, they provide evidence of historical change and contribute to the significance of the overall mining and settlement landscape. Modern mining infrastructure, modern mullock heaps, fencing and the Buck Reef West open cut mining operations are not of heritage significance.
Ravenswood Mining Landscape.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape has been formed through various phases of alluvial and reef mining activities from the late 1860s to the 1960s; however, the majority of surface evidence of mining infrastructure dates from the New Ravenswood Company era (1899-1917); and subsequent intermittent small scale mining and re-treatment of old mullock heaps and tailings dumps (1919-60s). Judge's Mill and the Partridge and Ralston Mill date from the 1930s.
The former General Grant, Duke of Edinburgh and Sunset No 1 Mines are situated on the northern edge of the modern Buck Reef West open cut and, along with the former Grant and Sunset Extended mine to the south, are wholly or partly within the active (restricted) mining area. To the north, the former Sunset No 2, Grand Junction and Little Grand Junction Mines, along with the Deep Mine and Mill, Judge's Mill, Partridges Mill and adjacent Mabel Mill Tailings Treatment Site are publicly accessible.
Former Grant and Sunset Extended Mine ().
The most southern of the mining landscape sites, the former Grant and Sunset Extended Mine (see the site map) retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1930s including:
The mine shaft is located to the northwest of the winding engine site. It was reconfigured () for modern use and has a concrete collar, metal grid and cage surround, as well as modern concrete headframe footings and machinery foundations nearby.
The area has been subject to earthworks and vegetation clearance. Two disturbed concrete headframe footings have been moved to the southwest of the winding engine site. Both are square in plan and have a diameter hole through the centre, with metal bracing within. One footing retains remnant timbers.
A ramped earth structure is situated to the north of the mine site; it is supported at its western end by boulders, corrugated and plate metal sheeting, and substantial round timbers (possibly reused headframe timbers).
Former General Grant Mine ().
Located north of the Grant and Sunset Extended mine, the General Grant Mine (see the site map) is prominently positioned on a ridge overlooking the mining landscape. It retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1920s-30s including:
The area has been subject to earthworks and vegetation clearance. Disturbed mullock, and concrete mounts and footings are visible across an elevated area to the east of the winding engine site that has been bulldozed. Part of a second square brick chimney stack (twenty courses high) lies amongst the upturned concrete mounts.
Two disturbed concrete headframe footings are located in the low-lying area between the General Grant and Duke of Edinburgh Mines.
Former Duke of Edinburgh Mine ().
Located on a ridge to the east of the General Grant Mine, the Duke of Edinburgh Mine (refer to the site map) retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1920s to 1940s including:
A modern fence that defines the boundary of the active mining operations traverses the mine site. Access to the caved underlie shaft and workings to the east of the headframe site is restricted.
Former Sunset No1 Mine (.
Located on a ridge to the west of the General Grant Mine, Sunset No1 Mine (see the site map) overlooks the Sunset No2 Mine to the north. It retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1920s to 1940s including:
An earth mound at the centre of the site indicates the location of the former underlie shaft headframe, and an area of disturbed mullock extends down the northern slope of the site. A large flattened clearing extends from the northeast to the northwest of the site; indicating the location of the former Sunset No 1 mullock heap (treated and removed ).
Former Sunset No 2 Mine (.
Located at the centre of the mining landscape, to the north of Sunset No1 Mine and south of Grand Junction Mine, Sunset No 2 Mine (see the site map) is situated at the intersection of Sunset Street and Grant Street (both unsealed). It retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era, and small scale mining and re-treatment of old mullock heaps from the 1920s to 1940s including:
An area of mullock extends to the north of the tailings treatment site; it includes a large heap situated between Sunset No 2 Mine and Grand Junction Mine to the north.
Former Grand Junction Mine (.
Located off Sunset Street, to the north of Sunset No 2 Mine and south of Partridges Mill, the Grand Junction Mine (see the site map) retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1930s to 1950s including:
Two small earth mounds are situated to the northeast of the chimney. An unsealed track traverses the site, between the fenced shaft and the winding engine mounts.
Former Little Grand Junction Mine (.
Located near the intersection of Siggers Street and School Street road reserves, the Little Grand Junction Mine is situated on a rise to the southwest of the former Ravenswood Ambulance Station. Little Grand Junction (see the site map) is the most southern of three mine shafts in the immediate vicinity, with a fourth shaft down the hill on Deighton Street. It retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era and small scale mining from the 1930s and 1940s including:
Small, disturbed mounds of mullock are situated to the north and west of the shaft.
Former Deep Mine and Mill (.
Located on the eastern fringe of the mining landscape, the Deep Mine and Mill (see the site map) is situated on a west-facing slope off School Street. It retains evidence from the New Ravenswood Company era, and sporadic processing following renovation of the mill in 1919, including:
Mabel Mill Tailings Treatment Plant (.
Located on the northern fringe of the mining landscape, between Deighton Street and Elphinstone Creek, the Mabel Mill Tailings Treatment Plant (see the site map) is an extension of the Mabel Mill to the north of the creek. The site retains evidence of mineral processing from the New Ravenswood Company era including:
Former Partridge and Ralston Mill (.
Located to the immediate west of the Mabel Mill Tailings Treatment area, the Partridge and Ralston Mill (see the site map) is situated between Deighton Street and Elphinstone Creek. The site retains evidence of intermittent mineral processing from the late 1930s to 1960s including:
Former Judge's Mill ().
Located in the western extents of the mining landscape, the Judge's Mill site (see the site map) retains evidence of the Ravenswood Gold Mining Syndicate's mineral processing activities from the late 1930s - early 1940s including:
An earth ramp and crushed ore deposit is situated to the south of the strongroom. The site is traversed by an unsealed road and a crushed granite walking track.
Chinese Settlement Area.
The Chinese Settlement Area dates from the 1870s to the early 20th century. While the settlement area included market gardens along Elphinstone Creek, the remaining physical evidence is concentrated south of Deighton Street and comprises the ruins of a temple, adjacent pig roasting oven, and associated archaeological features and artefact scatters (see Archaeological Evidence).
Former Temple ().
The temple remnants are located south of Deighton Street and comprise a series of concrete, stone and earth platforms with overall dimensions of approximately long and wide (Deighton Street is shown on the site map). The temple is orientated roughly north-south. From north to south the five platforms comprise:
A disturbed earth mound is situated to the south of the temple foundations. It has stone and brick inclusions and random-rubble stonework to the eastern end.
Former Pig Roasting Oven.
Eighteen metres to the northeast of the temple foundations are the remains of a brick and stone pig roasting oven. The structure (approximately ) is aligned east-west. The upper section has collapsed and it currently stands at high. The eastern end of the structure features a cylindrical brick and mortar hearth with stacked render framing the opening. The remaining structure is less formal in construction, comprising random-rubble stone and earth that has collapsed to the west.
Setting and Landscape Features.
Elphinstone Creek winds across the north and west of the mining landscape, which is traversed by a network of unsealed roads and walking tracks. The area has been cleared of remnant vegetation and regrowth is dominated by chinee apple ("Ziziphus mauritiana") and rubber vine ("Cryptostegia grandiflora"). Stands of various eucalypt species have been planted in an area that extends to the north of Duke of Edinburgh and east of Sunset No 2 Mines.
Much of the ground surface has been modified by the historical and subsequent mining operations. Mullock heaps punctuate the undulating landscape, most notably in the vicinity of the Grand Junction, Sunset No 2 and Deep Mines. A total of five prominent brick chimneys are dotted across the landscape. They have a range of stack types: three square; one round and one octagonal, and are a distinctive feature of the place.
Views are afforded to, from and across the mining landscape from a range of vantage points. Several of the mine sites (General Grant, Sunset No1, Duke of Edinburgh and Deep Mine) are elevated and offer panoramic views across the mining landscape and the town. Views from lower vantage points and along the tracks also offer glimpses of nearby and elevated features in the surrounding landscape, in particular the prominent brick chimneys.
Archaeological Evidence.
Artefacts associated with mining infrastructure and operations are concentrated amongst the ruins of the mine and mill sites, including: bottle glass; ceramics; bricks; and metal containers, cables, fixtures and fittings.
Moderate density scatters of industrial and domestic glass and ceramic artefacts extend across the ground surface to the east of the Mabel Mill tailings treatment plant, along Elphinstone Creek. A sub-surface concentration of black and green glass bottles is evident in an eroded gully within the Mabel Mill tailings treatment area.
High density artefact scatters associated with the Chinese temple and oven site include glass, ceramics and metal. There is some evidence of cooked bone fragments to the immediate west of the eroded oven.
An area to the south and west of the temple site contains several higher density concentrations of domestic artefacts accompanied by flattened sheets of kerosene tins, buckets, kettles, and drystone wall and platform features, which indicate the location of habitation sites. Ceramics of Chinese origin are evident at some of these sites. A narrow () brick lined shaft, possibly a well, is located on the south side of Deighton Street, near the former intersection with School Street.
An area containing evidence of possible alluvial mining is located immediately south of Judge's Mill and to the west of Sunset No 1 Mine. It comprises a gully with a regular channel cutting to the base (possible water race) and small earth mounds deposited along the banks. Artefact scatters extend along the banks of the gully and include ceramics, bottle glass and wire cut nails.
Heritage listing.
Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area is important in demonstrating the historical development of gold mining in Queensland. The Ravenswood goldfield (discovered 1868) was the first significant goldfield in north Queensland, the fifth largest gold producer in Queensland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and an Australian leader in metallurgy.
The mining landscape, including the ruins of 12 mines and mills punctuated by mullock heaps, is a physical legacy of the complex and innovative history of mining in the area. It contains important surviving evidence of mining operations conducted on and near the Ravenswood goldfield's most productive reefs during the boom period of the town's prosperity (1900–08). It also retains important surviving evidence of the evolution of mining practices, in particular the range of innovative technologies developed to extract gold from sulphide, or mundic, ores.
The Chinese settlement area, which dates from the 1870s to the early 20th century, is important in demonstrating Chinese involvement in the exploitation of natural resources and the evolution of mining settlements in Queensland. It retains important physical evidence of Ravenswood's early Chinese community, including the remains of the earliest known Chinese temple in Queensland and an adjacent pig roasting oven.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The remnants of the temple (the earliest known in Queensland) and pig roasting oven are rare surviving evidence of Ravenswood's Chinese community, which constituted an important but little-known part of Ravenswood's history. The temple and pig roasting oven site is a rare surviving example of the combination of these two elements in a Chinese settlement in Queensland.
The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.
The extensive mining landscape - its surface ruins, artefact scatters, and potential alluvial and sub-surface workings - has the potential to reveal information about late 19th and early 20th century mining practices and treatment processes.
The medium and high density artefact scatters, some domestic in origin and associated with evidence of habitation, have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the occupants and their material culture, and the proximity of industrial and domestic life in a remote goldfield settlement.
The rare Chinese temple and oven site, and associated artefact scatters, has the potential to yield information regarding early temple and oven construction methodology, the relationship between the two elements and their function in the community.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Characterised by its broad sweeps of modified ground, and collection of ruins from diverse mining and processing practices, the Ravenswood mining landscape is an excellent example of a historical goldfield. It retains the ruins of eight mines and four mills that are collectively important in illustrating the principal characteristics of reef gold ore extraction and metallurgical extraction sites from the late 19th and early 20th century.
The mine sites retain evidence of caved shafts, winding plant and engine mounts, and brick chimneys - key elements in layouts that demonstrate the ore extraction process. The mill sites retain evidence of their stamp battery and ball mill mounts, strong rooms, Wilfley table mounts, cyanide plants, settling tanks and tailings - complex assemblages that demonstrate ore crushing, concentrating, and other metallurgical processes required to extract gold from the mundic ore for which the Ravenswood goldfield was renowned.
The Ravenswood Chinese settlement area is important in demonstrating the characteristics of Chinese community settlements at north Queensland goldfields. Located close to Elphinstone Creek, along which the Chinese community were active in the cultivation of fresh produce, it is a specific cultural settlement area situated on the periphery of the main retail precinct of Ravenswood. It retains the ruins of a temple and adjacent pig roasting oven - physical elements in a spatial arrangement that demonstrate the social and cultural practices of goldfield Chinese communities.
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area, a distinctive, heavily modified landscape punctuated by brick chimneys, mullock heaps and other remnant mining structures, is an evocative reminder of the precarious and short-lived nature of Queensland's mining booms.
The place expresses the complex history of mining in the area and has picturesque qualities that can be experienced from a range of vantage points. The strong visual impact of the landscape is further enhanced by its close proximity to the town and its surviving historic building stock.
Views of the place and in relation to the town have been represented in brochures, postcards, art and photography. In particular, the landmark qualities of the tall brick chimneys are a distinctive feature in representations of Ravenswood.
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.
The Ravenswood Mining Landscape and Chinese Settlement Area has a special association with the work of Archibald Lawrence Wilson, Ravenswood's most notable entrepreneur, whose New Ravenswood Company is associated with the development of the gold mining industry in north Queensland, and gave significant impetus to the economic and social development of the region.
Wilson's involvement in raising capital in London had a significant impact on the physical appearance of the landscape through the establishment of numerous new mines and the modification of earlier mines in the early 1900s, evidence of which remains visible across the landscape.

James Mackie (MP)

James (Jem) Mackie (18 May 1821 – 28 December 1867) was a British Liberal Party and Whig politician and rugby footballer, sometimes credited with creating the sport.
Rugby football.
Mackie is sometimes credited as the creator of rugby football when, while he was at Rugby School in 1838–39, he picked up the ball and ran with it, becoming known as "the first great runner-in". This was against convention that, when a ball was caught, the player should retreat and kick towards the goal.
However, the sport is most often credited to William Webb Ellis, who was at the school from 1816 to 1825. The credit may have been given to Webb Ellis as Mackie was expelled from the school before the practice was legalised by the school in 1841, before an agreed set of rules was dictated, and his expulsion made him an "undesirable role model". Indeed, in an 1895 inquiry, author Thomas Hughes said Mackie had been the first to play the sport this way.
Political career.
Following in his father, John Mackie's footsteps, he was elected Whig MP for Kirkcudbrightshire in 1857 and held the seat until his death in 1867, becoming a Liberal in 1859. His death triggered the 1868 Kirkcudbrightshire by-election.

United States Ambassadors appointed by Donald Trump

This is a list of United States ambassadors appointed by the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump.
Ambassadorships are often used as a form of political patronage to reward high-profile or important supporters of the president. The most visible ambassadorships are often distributed either in this way or to the president's ideological or partisan confreres. Most ambassadorships, however, are assigned to foreign service officers who have spent their career in the State Department. Regardless, all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. While all ambassadors serve at the president's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time, career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment, and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president.
44% of Trump's appointees were political, a substantially higher percentage than typical.
As of October 2018, 92% of Trump's appointees were white, and 74% were male, with zero Black women.

Rebecca MacDonald

Rebecca MacDonald (born in 1953 as Ubavka Mitic) is a Canadian businesswoman from Toronto, Ontario of Serbian origin. Recipient of several business awards, she is founder and executive chair of Just Energy Group Inc., an energy commodities trading company.
Career.
New deregulation in Ontario's natural gas industry prompted Rebecca MacDonald to launch EMI in 1986. Her first company began to lose profits when gas prices fell several years later. In 1997, she re-entered the market by starting Ontario Energy Savings Corp., though the business showed minimum profits. When gas prices began to rise again in 2001, the second company was transitioned into a very profitable fund that became the backbone of Just Energy Group Inc. By taking Just Energy public, Macdonald made the company accountable to a board of directors. When gas prices fell again, the business expanded to the American and European markets, but also came under scrutiny for aggressive sales techniques and charging additional fees.
Extracurricular.
MacDonald sits on the board of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., the Royal Ontario Museum and the David Foster Foundation. She donated three million dollars to Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital to fight rheumatoid arthritis, a disease she herself has battled with. In 2017, Macdonald had the honour of ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. That same year, as part of the Horatio Alger Association of Canada, she was one of the hosts of the charity event "Canuck Place Gala", alongside Lorne Michaels.
Honors and awards.
In 2002, the Rotman School of Management gave MacDonald the Canadian Woman Entrepreneur of the Year award. She was also Profit Magazine's top Canadian Woman Entrepreneur six years in a row. Profit ranked her company as one of the fastest growing companies in Canada from 2004 through to 2007.
 MacDonald is a 2009 Horatio Alger Award Winner and also has an honorary doctorate from the University of Victoria.
In 2018, MacDonald was a recipient of the "Knight of the St. Sava Order of Diplomatic Pacifism" award. The honor was bestowed upon her by the Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dacic.

Alkaline pasta

Alkaline pasta, or alkaline noodles (also alkali noodles), is a variation of Chinese or Italian pasta in which a much higher than usual quantity of an alkaline component is part of the fabrication process. This is usually achieved by the introduction of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3 or sodium salt of carbonic acid) into the primary ingredients. In parts of China in which alkaline wheat noodles are common, traditional ones are made with alkaline water from wells. More commonly a mixture of sodium carbonate, which is also an anti-caking agent, and potassium carbonate is added directly. This mixture is what the Chinese call "jian" and what the Japanese call "kansui"; it is best known in the West for the ramen soup noodles from Japan that use it. Sometimes kansui can also be a solution of sodium hydroxide.
The addition of alkaline materials to such dishes as pasta makes them feel slippery in the mouth and on the fingers; they also develop a yellow color and are more elastic than ordinary noodles. Various flours such as ordinary all-purpose white flour, bread flour, and semolina flour can be used, with somewhat varying results. The yellow color is due to flavones that occur naturally in flour, which are normally colorless but turn yellow (flavo="yellow", Latin) at alkaline pH.
Noodles from Gansu Province in China include the chewy "hand-pulled" type, where the noodles are formed purely by hand, with no rolling or extrusion. Proper texture requires the addition of an alkaline ingredient called "peng" derived from certain ashes. Ash contains potassium carbonate, which makes the noodle dough softer and more tender by inhibiting the development of gluten. "Lan Zhou pulled noodles", even though the noodle makers may not be from Lan Zhou, the capital of Gansu, are becoming, according to the "New York Times", "a catchphrase that signifies deliciousness everywhere, [like] 'Chicago pizza' or 'New York bagels'."
Harold McGee, a well-known American food scientist and author, has drawn on the experience of such noted chefs as David Chang, owner of the Momofuku line of restaurants, and Fuchsia Dunlop of London, to outline a simple method by which home chefs can make alkaline noodles. 
A few tablespoons of ordinary baking soda are spread out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet and baked at 300 °F (150 °C) for an hour. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate; by baking it, water and carbon dioxide are exuded and what is left is the alkaline soda ash—alkaline enough to cause discomfort if touched to the skin. In plain text, the chemical reaction is sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) + heat → sodium carbonate + water vapor + carbon dioxide gas. Only a very small of amount of the resultant sodium carbonate is used in the preparation of McGee's pasta dish, just 1 teaspoon of it to 1-1/2 cups of semolina flour. When preparing the pasta, the sodium carbonate is first dissolved in a small quantity of water, which is then slowly added to the semolina. Afterwards, the kneaded dough is allowed to rest for an hour and is then rolled out very thin through a pasta machine and processed into the desired form of noodles. The unused portion of the sodium carbonate can be stored in a tightly sealed bottle and kept for future use.

Madworkshop Foundation

The Martin Architecture and Design Workshop (MADWORKSHOP) is a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit foundation that offers fellowships and educational programs for artists and designers.
MADWORKSHOP supports educational programs at the University of Southern California, Art Center College of Design and the USI Accademia di Architettura, Mendrisio in Switzerland. Supported projects include product and fashion design as well as architectural projects.
History.
MADWORKSHOP was first conceived in 2005 when noted Los Angeles architect and former A.C. Martin Inc. design principal and co-chairman David C. Martin, FAIA was approached to teach a furniture design studio at the USC School of Architecture. The hands-on fabrication class generated interest from students and connected with a greater trend in the study of design. This led Martin to create the Furniture Studio at USC School of Architecture, which has become a key staple of the undergraduate curriculum. The Furniture Studio teaches students how to build and weld, culminating with each student fabricating a full-scale furniture piece. A select number of students with extraordinary designs are awarded MADWORKSHOP fellowships to continue developing their projects with the goal of bringing them to market.
In 2013, David and his wife Mary Klaus Martin sponsored a class at the USC School of Architecture taught by architect and assistant professor R. Scott Mitchell. The course challenged students to design a site-specific pedestrian bridge titled the Arroyo Bridge. The long history of collaborations led David and Mary Martin to establish MADWORKSHOP. Since its inception in 2015, the foundation has supported numerous fellows and projects. The Foundation has also sponsored the USC MADWORKSHOP Homeless Studio as well as the Re-Defining Public Furniture &amp; Fixtures Design course at Art Center, which produced the permanent seating installation, "Sanke", at MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) in downtown Los Angeles.
Projects.
Homes for Hope.
The USC Homeless Studio coursework explored the architect’s role in helping to solve the Los Angeles homeless crisis. The concept of the Studio was conceived in 2016 by Mary Klaus Martin, Co-Founder of MADWORKSHOP, and developed in partnership with the USC School of Architecture and USC faculty members R. Scott Mitchell and Sofia Borges. It was driven by the need to address Los Angeles’ rapidly accelerating homelessness crisis. The Homeless Studio became a living laboratory where architecture students used the semester to create stackable transitional housing modules, called Homes for Hope. The modules measure 92 square feet and include a bed, a desk, and storage. The modules are set up in groups of 30 units with one shared base unit, which includes a bathroom, living and dining space, and a courtyard. Homes for Hope, the award-winning solution developed in the studio for emergency stabilization housing, won the Fast Company World Changing Ideas Award in 2017. In December, 2017, USC faculty members R. Scott Mitchell and Sofia Borges released "Give Me Shelter", published by ORO Editions, a book detailing the experience of architecture students taking on the homeless crisis in Los Angeles during the MADWORKSHOP Homeless Studio, with a foreword by Mayor Eric Garcetti.
Moca Grand Plaza.
In September 2017, The MADWORKSHOP Foundation sponsored a redesign of the facade and entrance area of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles Grand Avenue location. The MOCA project comprised students who developed a design proposal. Throughout the course, students collaborated with MOCA director Philippe Vergne and curator Helen Molesworth to create the proposal for the museum's plaza.
Light and Matter Studio.
MADWORKSHOP collaborated with Fondo Ambiente Italiano (FAI) to launch the Light and Matter Studio. Designer Riccardo Blumerat worked with students to create an exhibition entitled "Light Theaters", inspired by the Sacro Monte di Varallo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the nearby town of Varese.

Sanja Ilić

Aleksandar "Sanja" Ilić (; 27 March 1951 – 7 March 2021) was a Serbian and Yugoslav musician and composer.
Ilić started composing as a teenager. In 1971 he formed the rock band San, which disbanded in 1975, after the band's vocalist Predrag Jovičić died in concert from an electric shock. After this event Ilić decided not to perform live with a band again. He continued his career as a composer, composing several hit songs for Yugoslav pop and rock artists. He worked with composer and keyboardist Sloba Marković on the electronic music album "Delta Project" and actor and lyricist Irfan Mensur on the album "Plava ptica". In 2000, Ilić formed the ethnic music ensemble Balkanika, with which he recorded five albums and had numerous performances across the world. During his career, Ilić wrote music for theatre, film, television shows and various performers. He died in 2021 in Belgrade.
He was the brother of keyboardist and Generacija 5 leader Dragan Ilić.
Life and career.
Early life and career.
Ilić was born on 27 March 1951 in Belgrade. Ilić's father, Miodrag "Beli" Ilić was a well-known composer. Sanja Ilić composed his first song when he was 12. At age 16, he composed the song "Baj baj baj" ("Bye, Bye, Bye"), which was later performed by Bisera Veletanlić at "Jugovizija 1976" festival. In 1967, he joined the rock band Vragolani ("Naughty Boys"), which consisted of high school students. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Architecture.
With San (1970–1975).
In 1970, Ilić formed the band San ("The Dream"), gathering former members of beat bands Smeli, Samonikli, Bele Višnje and Vragolani. With San Ilić recorded five 7" singles. Durig San's activity, Ilić wrote music for the film "ITD" ("ETC.") and the rock opera "Arhanđeli i automati" ("Archangels and Automatons") performed in Belgrade's Dadov Theatre. On February 2, 1975, during a concert in Čair Hall in Niš, San vocalist Predrag Jovičić died from an electric shock. After this event Ilić disbanded San and decided not to perform live wirh a band again. In 1977, as a tribute to Jovičić, the members of San recorded songs they prepared for their debut album with singers Zdravko Čolić, Dado Topić, Bisera Veletanlić, Zdenka Kovačiček and Zlatko Pejaković.
Post-San (1975-2000).
In 1979, Ilić was a member of the supergroup Mag ("Wizard"), formed for the recording of the soundtrack for Goran Marković's film "National Class Category Up to 785 ccm". Mag consisted of former Korni Grupa member Josip Boček (guitar), former Elipse and Korni Grupa members Bojan Hreljac (bass guitar) and Vladimir "Furda" Furduj (drums), composer and musician Sloba Marković (keyboards) and Ilić (keyborads). Mag recorded songs written by compser Zoran Simjanović and lyricist Marina Tucaković. The vocals were sung by popular Yugoslav singers Dado Topić, Oliver Dragojević, Slađana Milošević, Oliver Mandić, Zumreta Midžić "Zuzi" and the members of the band Laboratorija Zvuka.
Ilić continued his career as a composer. In 1982, he composed the song "Halo, Halo" ("Hello, Hello"), with which the group Aska represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982. In 1984 he composed the hit song "Princeza" ("Princess"), performed by rock singers Dado Topić and Slađana Milošević. In 1987, Ilić recorded the electronic music album "Delta Project" with composer and keyboardist Sloba Marković. In 1992, on the lyrics of actor Irfan Mensur, Ilić composed music for the theatre play "Plava ptica" ("Blue Bird"). The songs were released on the album "Plava ptica". The title track, performed by well-known Serbian actors, became a hit, largely due to its anti-war lyrics. 
With Balkanika (2000-2021).

Marguerite Lindsley

Jane Marguerite Lindsley (later Marguerite Lindsley Arnold; October 2, 1901 – May 18, 1952) was the first woman to be appointed to a year-round park ranger position in the United States National Park Service. Lindsley had a ten-year career as a ranger and as a ranger-naturalist starting in 1921.
Early life and education.
Lindsley was born and raised in Yellowstone—her father, Chester Lindsley, was the park’s superintendent while it was transitioning from the Army to the NPS. Growing up in Yellowstone gave Marguerite a unique opportunity to connect with the land. She received an education from her mother, Maude, at home for most of her life before college.
Lindsley attended Montana State College for her undergraduate degree. By 1923, she had received her master’s degree in bacteriology from the University of Pennsylvania and was working in a lab. However, this job was not satisfying for Lindsley—she quit her job, bought a motorcycle, and rode cross-country back to her home in Yellowstone to pursue a career there.
Career.
In 1921, during her college years, Lindsley was first employed as a temporary ranger-naturalist in Yellowstone. In 1925, after receiving her graduate degree and returning to Yellowstone, she became the first permanent female park ranger in the country. Some individuals, including Chief Inspector J.F. Gartland of the Department of the Interior, voiced strong opposition to the appointment of women rangers, and Lindsley noted that she felt pressure to perform well despite criticisms of her suitability for the position of a ranger: "many still think that women's work should be inside and it is a problem sometimes to satisfy everyone even tho [sic] I may be qualified for the work in the field."
Regardless of these criticisms, Lindsley helped normalize women’s positions in the NPS—for example, because the NPS did not have an official ranger uniform for women, Lindsley designed her own. An adapted version of this uniform would be imitated by other women rangers and would eventually become standard. Lindsley worked alongside other pioneering women rangers and ranger-naturalists in Yellowstone, such as Irene Wisdom, Frieda Nelson, and Elizabeth Conard.
Lindsley performed a variety of jobs during her time as a ranger and a ranger-naturalist. Not only did she hold positions at information centers and museums at the park, but she also taught classes about the park, performed water testing, and published field notes in "Yellowstone Nature Notes".
Later life.
In 1928, Lindsley married fellow ranger Ben Arnold and began working park part-time during the summer season and writing for "Nature Notes" in the winter. Their son was born in 1932.

Wavertree Lane railway station

Wavertree Lane was one of the original stopping-places on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Stopping-places were commonly located at supervised level crossings where gatekeepers were available to signal trains to stop close to the point at which the line crossed the road, in this case Wavertree Lane (now Wavertree Road). The stopping-places were generally primitive in nature without platform or shelter for passengers. Wavertree Lane appeared in the first official list of stopping-places issued in February 1831. The list was probably issued to reduce the number of informal intermediate stops requested by passengers. In the early days only second class trains made such request stops although mixed class trains were introduced subsequently.
The stopping-place was close to Wavertree Hall, residence of Mr Charles Lawrence, chairman of the railway company. A short length of track was laid in the vicinity in Summer 1827, very early in construction of the line, presumably for demonstration and public relations purposes. However, the cuttings to the east and west appear to have been incomplete at the time of Thomas Telford's report in early 1829. On 14 June 1830 the locomotive "Arrow" took a train carrying directors of the company to Manchester. On the return the train terminated at Wavertree where they were given dinner at Wavertree Hall.
The station was probably one of the first to have a company-owned building with a cottage across the road for the gatekeeper.
The station closed to passengers in 1836 with the opening of the tunnel to Lime Street station from Edge Hill station (the latter was initially referred to in planning documents as New Wavertree Lane station). Ultimately the level crossing was replaced by a bridge and the area occupied by the station subsumed into industrial and railway development associated with the Edge Hill goods marshalling yards.

Lillian Katie Bradley (October 15, 1921 – February 11, 1995) was an American mathematician and mathematics educator who in 1960 became the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate in any subject at the University of Texas at Austin. She accomplished this ten years after African-Americans were first admitted to the school, and despite the dominance of the mathematics department at Austin by R. L. Moore, known for his segregationist views and for his snubs of African-American students.
Bradley was born in Tyler, Texas. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1938 from Texas College, and a master's degree in mathematics education in 1946 from the University of Michigan. She became a teacher at a segregated black high school in Hawkins, Texas, at Paul Quinn College, and at Texas College, before becoming an assistant professor of mathematics at Prairie View A&amp;M College. There, in 1957–1958, she was awarded a National Science Faculty Fellowship, one of only 100 awarded in the inaugural year of the program.
She completed her doctorate at the University of Texas in July 1960. Her dissertation, in mathematics education, was "An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Collegiate General Mathematics Course". In 1962 she moved from Prairie View to Texas Southern University, as an associate professor.
Bradley died in February 1995 at the age of 76.

Washburn &amp; Doughty

Washburn &amp; Doughty is a shipyard located in East Boothbay, Maine.
The company was founded in 1977 by Bruce Washburn and Bruce Doughty, then employees at Bath Iron Works. For the first several years of its existence, vessels were constructed on a lot in Woolwich until it moved to a building in East Boothbay. In July 2008, the shipyard burned to the ground in a fire sparked by a cutting torch. The fire caused an estimated $30 million in damage to the facility and under-construction vessels, and led the company to lay off 65 of its 100 employees. Immediately after the incident, the company began designing a replacement building, with operations continuing at other sites until being consolidated back to East Boothbay the following year. In 2016, the company began planning to expand to a site in Brunswick, Maine on the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, where it would locate steel cutting and some fabrication operations.
Washburn &amp; Doughty initially constructed primarily fishing boats, including some early examples of freezer trawlers on the US East Coast. It subsequently expanded into passenger vessels, and in 1997 delivered its first z-drive tugboat to a design that would eventually be the basis for most vessels built by the company—by 2018, Washburn &amp; Doughty had delivered over 50 such tugboats. Led by Bruce Washburn, who was educated as a naval architect, the company designs about three quarters of the ships it builds. Since 2000, the company has built almost exclusively tugboats, becoming the largest builder of them on the East Coast by 2007 and holding just under 30% of the market in 2016. In 2018, it was awarded its first ferry construction contract since the 1990s for a vehicle and passenger ferry, to enter service in 2020 for the Maine Department of Transportation.

Watson was a contributing author to "Should America Pay?", Dr. Raymond Winbush's 2003 publication on Reparations, and wrote the foreword in Herb Boyd's 2017 book, "Black Detroit: A People's History of Self Determination."
Political career.
Prior to her service as a member of the city council, Watson served as public liaison for Congressman John Conyers.
In 2003, Watson filed to run in a Special Election called to fill a vacancy on the Detroit City Council, which was created when Councilwoman Brenda Scott died on September 2, 2002. That February, Dick Gregory headlined Watson's first political fundraiser. On April 29, 2003, Watson won the Special Election 52% to 48%, defeating the highly favored Gil Hill, who was famous for playing the sharp-tongued police inspector in three "Beverly Hills Cop" movies.
Watson would subsequently win re-election to City Council and served as City Council President Pro Tem. During her tenure, Watson sponsored thousands of laws, including: laws that banned texting and talking while driving; a ban on smoking in public places; and the "Water Affordability Plan," which helped low-income citizens avoid water shut-offs. In 2009, The Nation Magazine recognized Watson as "the most valuable local elected official in the USA."
During Watson's tenure on City Council, her staff included future Michigan State Legislator Coleman Young II, who interned in her office.
In 2013, Watson announced her intention to retire. In December of that, a celebration of her career was held at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, where Dick Gregory again was the headliner.

Sara Iredell Fleetwood

Sara Iredell Fleetwood (1849–1908) was an American clubwoman and teacher. She was involved in the movement of black women into professional nursing, graduating as one of the first nurses from Howard University's Freedman's Hospital School of Nursing. She became the nursing superintendent at Freedman's, organized the Freedmen's Nursing Association and served as the first African-American woman on the nurse's examining board of the District of Columbia.
Early life.
Sara Louise Iredell was born in April 1849 in St. Louis, Missouri to Elizabeth Susan (née Webb) and Geoffrey George Iredell. Her father was originally from Edenton, North Carolina and was the son of a slave who had been emancipated. At the time Sarah and her sister Laura (1850–1909) were born, he was operating a barber shop in St. Louis. Her mother, originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was the sister of Frank J. Webb, and they were the children of abolitionists Louisa (née Burr), illegitimate daughter of Aaron Burr, and Francis Webb. During Iredell's childhood, the family moved to Philadelphia making their home with their Webb cousins. Between 1856 and 1858, she attended Oberlin College as a pupil-teacher.
Career.
After her graduation from Oberlin, Iredell moved back to Philadelphia and began her career teaching in public schools. In 1863, she became a founding member of the Ladies Union Association, serving as the organization's secretary. The Ladies Union was created to fund raise and provide assistance to African-American soldiers who were either sick or wounded. In 1866, Iredell worked as a pupil-teacher at the Institute for Colored Youth, completing her training in 1867. She then taught from 1867 to 1868 at the Roberts Vaux School before moving to teach in the public school system of Frederick, Maryland. Because of low pay and the treatment black teachers received, she left Maryland and began working as a teacher in Washington, D. C.
In Washington, Iredell became involved in the National Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Women and Children. She met and married Medal of Honor recipient Christian Fleetwood in 1869 and the couple subsequently had a daughter, Edith. They were very involved with the prominent African-American professional community hosting literary salons, and entertaining their guests with theatrical and musical performances. In 1892, Fleetwood was one of the nine co-founders of the Colored Women's League of Washington, an organization which focused on issues faced by black women. She spoke at various functions addressing issues like child care and parenting training, establishment of nurseries for working women, and sanitation. In 1898, she and Anna Evans Murray attended the Congress of Mothers as representatives of the Colored Women's League.
In 1893, Fleetwood enrolled in the first class of nurses admitted to Howard University's Freedman's Hospital School of Nursing, studying under Daniel Hale Williams. That same year, she and her cousin, Evelyn D. Shaw organized relief efforts to feed and house those impacted by the Panic of 1893. She graduated from Freedman's in 1896 and initially became a private nurse in Washington. In February 1901, when the previous nursing supervisor resigned, Fleetwood was appointed by Dr. Austin M. Curtis as the replacement supervisor for the training school. She took a national civil service examination to qualify for the post outscoring applicants from throughout the country. Her appointment marked the first time a black supervisor held the post. In August of the same year, she was confirmed as supervisor by the chief surgeon, Dr. William A. Warfield, who reappointed her and gave her the title, Directoress of Nurses. She remained the director until 1904, when she resigned from the post.
Fleetwood organized the Freedmen’s Nurses Association and attended the national convention of the Nurses Association Alumni as the association's delegate in 1904. In 1907, when the examining board for graduate nurses was established in Washington, D. C. she was selected as the first black representative on the board by the Graduate Nurses' Association. When her term expired in June of that same year, she was not reappointed and despite protests by the commissioners, no other African American representative was appointed to the board.
Death and legacy.
Fleetwood died on February 1, 1908 in Washington, D. C. from complications of diabetes. She and her husband's papers make up the Christian A. Fleetwood Papers, which were donated to the Library of Congress in 1947. The site for the house in which the couple resided, at 319 U Street NW, in the LeDroit Park Historic District of Washington, D. C. is part of the African American Heritage Trail in the capital city and is identified by a historic marker.

SB Kathleen

The SB "Kathleen" was a spritsail Thames barge built by Glover at Gravesend, Kent, in England in 1901, and registered in Rochester. Her official number was 113,708. She was built to carry grain- for capacity rather than speed. she was long and had a beam of . Light, she drew of water, and laden .
Kathleen's rig was changed with commercial needs. She took on an auxiliary motor, and then became a motor barge and in the 1960 was registered and worked as a timber lighter. She was sunk in 1923 by a Cunarder then refloated. In the 1953 East Coast storms she was washed up the shore at Whitstable and demolished several buildings. She was rerigged by an enthusiast in 1966 and raced again, before meeting her end in Spaarndam in 1986, with spars and fittings being passed on to the Wyvenhoe.
History.
Working barge.
She was launched in 1901 and worked for Daniels Brothers of Whitstable principally as a grain barge. 
In the first world war she carried other dry cargoes such as coal, timber and iron pipes. Modifications were made to her hold for easier loading, though this was later reversed. She continued to do cross channel work until 1920: as a barge she could safely sail over the Goodwin Sands if the leeboards were raised. After the 1914–1918 conflict, minefields remained and passage through the swept channel was only permitted in daylight. In the 1920s regular work was in grain and animal foodstuffs all within the confines of the estuary and the river.
On 6 March 1923, she and two other Whitstable barges were taking on cargo in Greenwich when the Cunard steamer, "Virgilia" (1918–1944) lost control and smashed into them, sinking two of them. "Why Not" was built at Faversham in 1866 (38 Reg Tons) and "W H Randall" was constructed at Sittingbourne in 1876 (44 Reg Tons). Kathleen was a little larger at 53 tons. The "Virgilia" was steel built, registered at 5,697 tons. All three barges re-entered service. The Why Not, had previously survived an incident in 1917 when she has been hit by a 2-seater aircraft from the Royal Flying Corps No.63 Squadron from the airfield at Joyce Green Isolation Hospital, the Kathleen rendered assistance.
She was converted to an auxiliary in 1945, launched again as a sailing barge in 1953 then turned into a full motor barge in 1954.
In 1944, the "Kathleen" was in Whitstable for a refit and was spotted by Edgar March, the naval historian. He used the opportunity to make a full survey of the "Kathleen", making notes and producing five sides of engineering drawings of her, and commenting on the sails and the rigging. This was published in 1948, making her one of the most thoroughly recorded barges. In 1946 the auxiliary engine was fitted, and the cabin detailed by March was changed.
On the night of the Great Storm of 1953- the night the tide came in and didn't go out, "Kathleen" was on the slipway at Anderson, Rigden and Perkins yard, Island Wall, Whitstable. She was washed up and demolished the slipway and many buildings in the shipyard, ending up at right angles to the slip, A special temporary slip had to be built in order to launch her again.
By 1954 the Kathleen was relying increasingly in her engine, and her sprit and mainmast were removed. The top mast was lowered into the mastcase. The rigging had become a hindrance when loading cargo, so in September she had a , trysail bent to the topmast. The Kathleen was a Whitstable barge sailing for Daniels: the port was in decline and on the death of the owner, the remaining barges were sold to the London and Rochester Trading Company Ltd. Though there were forty-two freights in 1958 they were mainly part loads. Fred Wraight Jnr left the boat in 1960- she took her last cargo in October 1961, her engine was removed, and she was laid up and decommissioned at Strood on 23 November 1961. 
Barge yacht.
She was re-rigged as a barge yacht at Heybridge in 1965. Parts for the work, came from all over the region. The topsail and a foresail came from Lower Halstow, the mast case came from Pin Mill from the hulk of the "Charles Hutton". Many blocks came from Reuben Wests barge yard. The mizzen spars and leeboard winches of the "Dorothy", came from Cubitt's Yard the main horse was the fore horse from the "Orinoco". The main mast and the standing rigging came from Erith, from the "Lady Mary", built in 1900 as an F.T. Everard's coaster. A leeboard was made from a wood called keruing, another was borrowed, and in 1966 the mainsail was lent by the "Nellie Parker", In 1967, Kathleen raced using a mainsail lent by the "Venta".
She had a new owner, Pat Murphy who invested in a new mainsail and a pair of Kelvin 44 hp diesels. 
She was sold and moved to the Netherlands in 1975 where she served as a motor-sailor houseboat with a six-cylinder diesel. She was finally hulked in 1983 near Spaarndam. Her engine and shafts were removed to use in a ketch yacht in Amsterdam by Jan Witterman, her spars and fitting were removed and used in the 1981 restoration of the .
Construction.
Thames barges were built for strength. They had flat bottoms to allow them to be easily beached or lie on the river mud, and were rigged to allow them to be operated by two men and possibly a lad. They were built in bargeyards adjacent to a river or creek on bargeblocks- a series of trestles raised about a metre from the compacted ground, that allowed working access above and below. Kathleen was built at Gravesend in 1901. Over time her rig was changed to suit commercial conditions.
The keel was a piece of elm. It was broader than it was deep and long. At the bow the stempost was raised vertically and at the stern the sternpost, these were made from lengths of English oak. The apron and the inner sternpost were strengthening timbers. The fore and aft deadwood would raise the floors to give shape at the bow and the sweep to the fashion timbers of the transom. Across the keel and deadwood were laid the 'floors', these were oak timbers at centres. The length of each floor would be taken of a half hull model, most would be long, the same length as her beam. On top of the floors, on top of the keel, on earlier barges was bolted a massive Oregon pine keelson. This used iron bolts. On the "Kathleen" the keelson was a made of a steel section, in profile similar to railway line (): it was cheaper but could distort. The keelson would be scarfed into the apron and deadwood and would be shorter than the keel. There were equivalent stemsons and sternsons.
The futtocks (side-frames) were dovetailed onto the end of each floor, and every other joint was strengthened with an iron angle plate. The futtocks were of oak and of varying length averaging . Temporary cross-poles were used to hold the ends of the futtocks in place. The barge was now 'in frame', and the shipwright approved the lines. Ribbands were temporarily nailed to the outside of the frames to hold this position. The inner angle between the floor and the futtocks were stiffened by inner chines or chine keelsons, made of a single piece of pitch pine This was bolted to each floor and futtock. Above it was a oak stringer that was bolted to the futtocks and led out to stem and stern post.
Ceilings and Linings.
The ceilings were now laid on the floors. These would be pine planks thick, and as wide as available. The height of the deck was marked on the frames- forming a beam-line, and a beam thickness beneath it, a oak inwale was bolted to the futtocks. The inside of the hold was lined with thick pine. The inwale formed a ledge on which the curved beams of the deck, and the carlings rested. The two large holds made it impossible to use deckbeams alone. There were 3 beams afore the forehold, three beams under the mast-case between the holds, 2 between the mainhold and the companionway to the cabin, two supporting the transom. On the Kathleen, the port and starboard decks were of differing widths.
The rig.
When she was built, the Kathleen had a bowsprit, main mast and a mizzen mast. She was rigged with spritsails on both masts and a topsail on the main. She was rerigged in 1926 without a bowsprit. In 1946 she lost her mizzen when an engine was added. In 1954 her rig was reduced to that of a motor barge- and from 1961 to 1965 she was used as a lighter, with engine and mast stripped away. When she was converted to a barge yacht for the 1966, 1967 sailing races, her rig was similar to that in 1926. 
Spars.
The mainmast was made of spruce; it was to the head, and it was to the hounds. The sprit was . The topmast was to the hounds; it had a pole, and a headstick.
The mizzen mast was to the head. The sprit was , and the boom was . The bowsprit was with outboard.
Standing rigging.
She was rigged with shrouds. 
Sails.
The mainsail was (weather), by (head) with a lee of and a of foot , giving a sail area of .
The topsail was (weather), with a lee of and a of foot , giving a sail area of .
The foresail was (weather), with a lee of and a of foot , giving a sail area of . The jib was (weather), with a lee of and a foot of .

Her mizzen was (weather), by (head) with a lee of and a of foot , giving a sail area of .
The sails on a Thames barge are red ochre in colour. The sailcloth is of flax, and to be kept in a supple and waterproof condition it must be dressed. Importantly, the flax must not dry out or will chafe against the rigging or against the brails when not in use. The sailmakers exact formula is a closely guarded secret, and sailormen believe that some dressings are faster than others. It is based on red-ochre (protects against UV) suspended in a mixture of fish oils, linseed oil, seawater and horse urine. On conversion Dilberry's formula was used.
Models.
There are three models of the Kathleen (1901) in the ship collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. Only one of them is on display though. It is to be found in the exhibition space in Chatham Historic Dockyard.

Bus Regulatory Reform Act

The Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 (, ) was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on September 20, 1982. The law contained provisions considered "deregulatory" of the bus industry, representing the largest legislation of regulatory reform since 1935.
On signing the bill into law, Reagan stated:
Law.
The bill included reducing restrictions on bus lines to add or remove stops, and increasing ease of entry of entrepreneurs into the bus service market. As such, authority could be granted to any "fit, willing, and able" carrier unless a protestant could show the new authority was contrary to public interest. The bill provided the Interstate Commerce Commission could investigate or suspend rates considered discriminatory or predatory. It could also overrule state regulatory authorities on intrastate "rate and exit issues" if state rulings caused "undue burdens" on interstate commerce.
Following the enactment of the new law, the Interstate Commerce Commission received over 2000 applications to operate new bus services. However, the rate of service loss was not substantially different from that observed prior to passage.
Supporters of the Act consider it "beneficial in improving the economic efficiency of carriers", while "some minor reservations" exist "regarding its adverse effects on smaller towns and rural areas".
Those most affected by the bill were union bus drivers as the deregulation of the industry allowed for new, non-union workers to flood the market and decrease wages across the board, leading in 1983 to the Greyhound Bus Line Strikes which lasted several weeks nationally.

Guy Allen

Guy Allen (born September 5, 1958) is a ProRodeo Hall of Fame cowboy and an 18-time World Steer Roping Champion. He competes in rodeos sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). He won the world title for the steer roping event 18 times when competing at the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR) and also won the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) Average title five times. He had won the title 11 times in a row when Buster Record broke his streak. Allen is also inducted into seven rodeo halls of fame.
Early life.
Guy Allen was born on September 5, 1958, in Coushatta, Louisiana, to a ranching family. He graduated from Santa Anna High School. He started rodeo in 1961. His father and brother are also PRCA members and the three all qualified together for the NFSR in 1983, the first time a father and two sons had qualified for the event at the same time.
Career.
Allen competes on the PRCA rodeo circuit. He most recently competed in 2016. At age 7, Allen traveled to rodeos with his father to compete. At age 13, he had become an adept steer roper. In 1976, at age 16, he joined the PRCA. He filled his permit within a month of joining. "Filling a permit" is when a contestant fulfills the requirements to become a PRCA card holder, which includes purchasing a permit and earning a minimum dollar amount at sanctioned rodeos. As a card holder, a contestant is allowed to compete in finals events and gain official ranking. At age 19, he competed in his first NFSR and won his first world title. He also competes in team roping.
In 2000, in Duncan, Oklahoma, Allen set a new world record for the fastest steer roping time at 7.9 seconds. He held the record until 2012 when, on June 2, Cody Scheck set a new world record with a 7.7-second run at the Old Fort Days Rodeo in Fort Smith, Arkansas.
A steer roper by the name of Buster Record had been trying to win his first world record for ten years and break Allen's consecutive record streak. Allen had reached a streak of 11 straight titles by that time approaching the 2002 NFSR. Record finished the regular season ahead of Allen by $205, which had not been achieved in 13 years. Record ended Allen's world title streak at 11 consecutive titles with an all out performance at the 2002 NFSR. Record's winning earnings at the NFSR at the Amarillo National Center in Amarillo, Texas, were $56,575. He was well ahead of Trevor Brazile who earned $47,871 for No. 2 and Allen at No. 3 with $47,789.
In 1959, Jim Shoulders set a record of 16 world championships. This record stood until Allen matched the record in 2001 after winning his 16th steer roping title. Two years later in 2003, Allen broke Shoulder's record after winning a 17th title. He won his 18th and final title to date in 2004. In 2013, Trevor Brazile won another all-around title and his total number of world titles moved to 19 world titles. This broke Allen's record of 18 world titles. As of 2019, Brazile has 25 world titles, seven more than Allen, who is in second place with 18 titles, and Shoulders is in third place with 16 titles.
Summary.
Allen won the world title for the steer roping event 18 times in 1977, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1991–2001, and 2003, 2004 when competing at the NFSR at each season's end. He won 11 consecutive titles from 1991 to 2001; the streak was broken by Buster Record in 2002. Allen also won five NFR Average titles in 1989, 1991, 1997, 2000, and 2004. He set the record for world's fastest steer roping speed at 7.9 seconds in 2000, which lasted until 2012. Allen holds the record for the titles in a single event at 18 titles as well as the most steer roping titles. He also holds the most consecutive steer roping titles at 11.
Award winning horses.
Annually, the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) and the PRCA selects the best three timed-event horses in several categories: steer wrestling, team roping, tie-down roping, steer roping, and barrel roping in the PRCA. Owners are awarded a bonus and a bronze. Voting is conducted by the top PRCA timed-event contestants. In his career, Allen has owned two horses who have been awarded AQHA/PRCA Horse of the Year in Steer Roping. In 1997, Jack Bart Tender (nicknamed Bullet) was the winner. In 1999–2001 and 2004, Two D Ole Man (nicknamed Jeremiah) was the winner. Jeremiah was retired and was spending his retirement on Mack Alitizer's Ranch in Del Rio, Texas. On September 5, 2012, Jeremiah, a brown gelding, who was 25 years old, died.
Personal life.
Allen lives in Santa Anna, Texas. He has two daughters. His two favorite pastimes are golf and ranching. The Kansas City Chiefs are his favorite sports team. His favorite rodeo performer is Sonny Davis. He was nicknamed "Legend" by Tee Woolman, a companion steer roper and team roper, and other peers.

Music for the Motherless Child

Music for the Motherless Child is a collaboration album between English folk guitarist Martin Simpson and Chinese pipa player Wu Man, released by Water Lily Records in 1996. As with the other album's released on the label, it was recorded at Christ the King Chapel, St. Anthony Seminary, Santa Barbara, by Tamil producer and label owner Kavichandran Alexander, who, also similarly to the label's other releases, curated and oversaw the project as a fusion between the music of two disparate cultures. Neither Simpson or Man had met before the recording of the album, which was done in only a single session that lasted seven hours. Alexander employed vacuum tube recording and took advantage of the church's natural acoustics.
The album features five traditional pieces, mostly drawn from American and European folk music, as well as one written by Simpson. A conspicuous blues influence and style is evident throughout the album. The duo claim that "Music for the Motherless Child" is dedicated to "the alchemists of both East and West." Upon the release, the album received mainly positive reviews from music critics, who largely complimented the blend of Simpson and Pipa's disparate musical styles. The album has since been re-released as a SACD.
Background and recording.
English folk guitarist Martin Simpson had built up a career since the 1970s combining the Celtic folk styles of the United Kingdom and Ireland with American folk styles such as blues and country music, and became acclaimed for his intricate, technical guitar playing skills. He had released four albums between 1990 and 1995. Chinese musician Wu Man, meanwhile, is a virtuoso master of the pipa, a type of lute indigenous to the country. She made her international debut with the album "Chinese Music for the Pipa" (1993), which was said by one critic to "highlight her extraordinarily emotive playing." Both Simpson and Man had been living in the United States for several years by the time of "Music for the Motherless Child"'s recording.
The genesis of "Music for the Motherless Child" came from Tamil producer Kavichandran Alexander for his record label Water Lily Acoustics. Each album on the label was a project overseen and produced by Alexander, who brought disparate folk or classical musicians together to fuse their disparate musical styles over the course of an album. In a review of the album, "Musicworks" described the scenario: "Water Lily Acoustics had a great idea: put a few musicians from different cultures together in a room, turn on a DAT recorder, and see what transpires." The first album on the label, "A Meeting by the River" (1993) by Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, won Alexander a Grammy Award. "Music for the Motherless Child" is another of these collaborations, with Alexander bringing Simpson and Man together. In a run-down of the label's catalogue, he writes:
As with the other Water Lily Acoustics albums, "Music for the Motherless Child" was recorded at Christ the King Chapel, St. Anthony Seminary, Santa Barbara, California, with Alexander taking advantage of the church's acoustic properties and using vacuum tube electronics which he had custom made. Also similarly to the label's other albums, the two musicians had not met before recording. Simpson had never even heard Man play before, even on a recording. Recording took place in April 1995. While some accounts state that the album was recorded in one, singular 20-hour session from start to finish, it was in fact recorded in a single session from 7:00pm to 2:30am. Simpson, playing guitar, and Man, playing pipa, are the only musicians on the album, while Alexander produced the album. Tim de Paravicini was technician consultant, with technical support from Roger Modjeski. The record was mastered by Chris Rice.
Composition.
"Music for the Motherless Child" fuses Simpson's folk blues-style guitar work with Man's exotica pipa playing, creating what Tim Sheridan of AllMusic describes as "a most unusual sonic world, a place where East meets West and the blues reign supreme." With the exception of "A-Minor Blues", which was composed by Simpson, the material on the album is traditional, and mainly draws from American and European folk music. "A-Minor Blues" takes influence from Appalachian banjo styles and the unsettling E minor playing of Delta blues musician Skip James. Man's pipa work on the track is said to be even more blues-styled than Simpson's guitar work, especially on her tremolo passages. "The Coo-Coo Bird" is a traditional American tune which is similarly derived from the banjo. The album's arrangement of the piece is said to "[blur] the line between bluegrass and Chinese folk," given that, throughout the track, the pipa and guitar parts constantly switch. ABC Radio felt the track had a distinctively Chinese feel. "Dives and Lazarus" is a traditional Irish tune, though here the arrangement more closely resembles blues music.
Release and reception.
"Music for the Motherless Child" was released by Water Lily Acoustics in 1996, with photography from Michael Sexton. The album is dedicated to "the alchemists of both East and West." It received critical acclaim; Tony Sheridan of AllMusic rated the album four and a half stars out of five. He felt that, as was the case with several other of Alexander's "terrific ventures," "Music for the Motherless Child" "approaches the common language of a truly global music. Amazing stuff." Reviewing "Music for the Motherless Child" for the NPR series "All Things Considered", writer Banning Eyre described the album as "lovely." Colin Larkin called the album "sparkling" in "The Encyclopedia of Popular Music". "Musicworks" were less pleased with the album, saying that the album works on first listen, but after that, "[t]he music quickly becomes awkward." The album has since been re-released as a SACD, and is archived in Singapore's National Library Board.

All songs are traditional, except "A-Minor Blues", written by Martin Simpson.

Microtis quadrata

Microtis quadrata, commonly known as the south coast mignonette orchid or south coast onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to south-west coastal areas of Western Australia. It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to one hundred small, pale green flowers. This onion orchid grows on low mounds in swamps, often with other species of mignonette orchids, and flowers much more prolifically after fire.
Description.
"Microtis quadrata" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and one hundred pale, yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long and wide and forms a hood over the rest of the flower. The lateral sepals are long, wide and curl downwards. The petals are about long, wide and are held under the dorsal sepal. The labellum is more or less rectangular in shape, about long and wide and turns downwards, almost touching the ovary. Flowering occurs from December to January, much more prolifically after fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
The south coast mignonette orchid was first formally described in 1990 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected in a swamp near Nornalup. Bates gave it the name "Microtis media" subsp. "quadrata" and published the description in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens". In 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Microtis quadrata". The specific epithet ("quadrata") is a Latin word meaning "four-cornered", referring to the shape of the labellum.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis quadrata" grows in seasonally wet depressions and in swampy mounds in near-coastal areas between Perth and Augusta. It is often found with other species of "Microtis" orchids.
Conservation.
"Microtis quadrata" is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

Massacre at Sand Creek (Playhouse 90)

Massacre at Sand Creek was an American television film broadcast on December 27, 1956, as part of the CBS television series, "Playhouse 90". It was the 13th episode of the first season. 
Plot.
The film tells a story of the Sand Creek massacre, an 1864 massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army.
Cast.
The cast included performances by:
Production.
Arthur Hiller was the director in his first production for "Playhouse 90". William Sackheim was the producer and also wrote the teleplay. Ray Cory was the director of photography, and Henry Batista was the editor. The film was produced by Screen Gems for "Playhouse 90". It was the third "Playhouse 90" film produced by Screen Gems.
Steve Drumm, a Blackfoot Indian, served as the makeup and hair expert for the actors playing the parts of the Indians. He was in charge of ensuring the use of authentic haircuts, applying war paint, and overseeing scalpings.
The production used approximately 75 horses. Actor John Derek emphasized the importance of the horses: "Any western star is only as good as his horse. Put a dashing hero on a drooping, plodding horse and even the most cityfied youngster would pelt the television screen . . . A spirited, prancing hunk of horseflesh is as necessary as the camera."
Reception.
Donald Kirkley in "The Baltimore Sun" criticized the film for its historical "changes and inventions." In addition to changing the villain's name from Chivington to Templeton, Kirkley noted that the production radically altered the details of the massacre as well as the motive. The real Chivington, wrote Kirkley, was a former minister motivated by a fervent belief that Indians "were no better than wild beasts, to be exterminated when found." The script changed the fictional Templeton's motive to one of personal ambition.

Moitaki

Moitaki is a Ndyuka village in the Sipaliwini District of Suriname. The village is inhabited by the Misidyan clan or "lo". The late gaanman Gazon Matodya was born in Moitaki.
Moitaki is situated near the Gran Olo rapids between the village of Yawsa further upstream and Puketi further downstream.
Energy.
Between 1985 and 1987, electricity was provided by an overhead power line connected to the Puketi hydroelectric power plant. After this power plant stopped working during the Surinamese Interior War there have been attempts to rehabilitate the facility, but after a university delegation in 2003 and 2004 investigated the possibilities for hydroelectric power in the region, the Ministry for Regional Development decided to instead fund the construction of a larger hydroelectric power plant at the Gran Olo rapids nearby. Although it will initially only power Puketi and Futupasi, the plan is to eventually connect Moitaki to the grid as well.

Real utopian sociology

Real utopian sociology is an emancipatory social science created and practiced by Erik Olin Wright. The apparent contradiction in its name is intentional: this sociology seeks to find existing utopian projects and evaluate their potential to replace systems of domination, particularly as an anti-capitalism strategy. Simply put, real utopian sociology is the study of feasible utopian models for society and pathways to achieve them.
Overview.
Starting in 1991 Wright, organized a series of workshop conferences known as "The Real Utopian Project" that model the practice of real utopian sociology. The conferences are sponsored by the A.E. Havens Center for Social Justice at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and structured around "a provocative manuscript that lays out the basic outlines of a radical institutional proposal." This manuscript is then sent to 15–20 scholars, who write essays on the topic. Prior to the conference these essays are circulated to all the conference participants and then each is discussed at the conference. Following the conference, participants have the opportunity to revise their work before it’s collectively published in Verso’s "Real Utopias Project" series; with the exception of papers from the first 1991 conference, which were not published as a series.
Past conference topics include: Basic Income Grants; Secondary Associations and Democratic Governance; A Model for Market Socialism, which was organized around the book, "A Future for Socialism", rather than a manuscript; Efficient Redistribution in Advanced Capitalism; Deepening Democracy; Rethinking Redistribution; Pensions and the Control of Capital Accumulation; Institutions for Gender Egalitarianism: Creating the Conditions for Egalitarian Dual Earner/Dual Caregiver Families; Legislature by Lot; Pathways to a Cooperative Economy; and Democratizing Finance.

The Big Bang (Atlanta)

"The Big Bang" is the pilot episode of American comedy-drama television series "Atlanta". It originally aired on FX on September 6, 2016, back-to-back with the second episode "Streets on Lock". The pilot episode focuses on Earn Marks trying to convince his rapper cousin Alfred to let him be his manager. The episode was written by series creator Donald Glover (who also plays Earn) and directed by Hiro Murai. On September 7, 2016, FX released the first two episodes of "Atlanta" on YouTube for free.
Plot.
The series opens with a confrontation between local Atlanta rapper Alfred "Paper Boi" Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) and a man who damages Alfred's car for no apparent reason. Alfred's cousin Earnest "Earn" Marks (Donald Glover) tries to mediate the situation whilst stoned sidekick Darius Epps (Lakeith Stanfield) has a sensation of déjà vu. The episode flashes back to earlier in the day where the life of Earn is shown. Earn is a homeless Princeton dropout and living with his baby daughter's mother, Vanessa "Van" Keefer (Zazie Beetz), having been kicked out of his parents' house. He is working a dead-end job signing passengers up for credit cards at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport when he learns his cousin Alfred had released a new mixtape under the rap name "Paper Boi." Alfred initially sees Earn as a leech (Earn hadn't spoken to him since the funeral of Alfred's mother), but Earn makes an effort to get Paper Boi to make him his manager by going to a local radio station and bribing the DJ to play Paper Boi's song. Later, just as they listen to the song on Alfred's car radio, a man walking by suddenly snaps off one of the side-view mirror, resulting in the incident at the opening scene which ultimately culminates with a shootout. Earn and Alfred are promptly arrested, while Darius escapes the scene.
Production.
In 2013, Deadline announced that Donald Glover would be developing a new series about Atlanta for FX. In 2014, FX ordered a pilot for the series.
"The Big Bang" was filmed in July 2015 at various locations around the Atlanta metropolitan area. Airport scenes set at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport were actually filmed at Infinite Energy Arena in Duluth, Georgia.
Reception.
The episode received mainly positive reviews from critics. IGN called the episode "a comedic slow burn" while Indiewire stated that the series was "on the cusp of something great".
The pilot was viewed by 1.08 million viewers during its premiere and earned an 18-49 rating of 0.5.
After submitting "The Big Bang" to Emmy voters for consideration, Glover won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series on September 17, 2017; this made him the first black man to win the award since Robert Guillaume in 1985.

Recent work.
"Teapots and Computer Graphics" (2006).
This series incorporates the yearly addition of words into the English dictionary, using terms related to "teapots" and "computer graphics" as a reference point. Giloth created drawings that observe the vast difference in language development between the two. Through her research, Giloth found 231 words in relation to "teapots", a term whose history can be traced back to the 15th century, and 1243 words in relation to "computer graphics", a term that only came into existence around the 1950s. She used these words in her work to consider the patterns shared between the two terms.
"Dimanche Matin aux Portes d'Hotel de Ville" (2006-2011).
Giloth printed lightjet documentation of Hotel de Ville figures that are in rotation with the changing seasons.
"BioGrids" (2011).
In 2011, Giloth created a series of prints inspired by her family history. These BioGrids were based on the mother-daughter relationship. Inspired by her family's quilts and drawings made by her mother, Giloth used digital images in related to ideas of evolution and genealogy to create these prints.
These archival pigment prints measure 40x40”, and were printed on Museo Fine Art Rag Paper.

Reginia gens

The gens Reginia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but several are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Reginius" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from cognomina ending in "-inus". "Reginus", the surname and probable root of this nomen, belongs to a type of cognomen derived from the names of places, in this case the ancient city of Rhegium in Bruttium, presumable the place where the ancestors of the Reginii lived.
