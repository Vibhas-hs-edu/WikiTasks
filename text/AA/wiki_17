National minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina

The legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognises three constituent peoples and 17 national minorities ("nacionalne manjine"). These latter include 2.73% of the total population of the country, i.e. 96,539 persons. The biggest community is the Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are estimated at around 58,000 persons.
Legislative framework.
The state-level Law on the Protection of National Minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in 2003, followed by the Law on the Protection of National Minorities of the Republika Srpska in 2005, and the Law on the Protection of National Minorities in Federation of BiH in 2008. Similar laws were passed also by the Government of the Brcko District of BiH and three cantons of the Federation of BiH. In June 2020 the Brcko District adopted a new Law on the rights of National Minorities.
Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2010.
National Minority Councils.
Since 2006, the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina established the Council of National Minorities, as a special advisory body to give opinions, advice and proposals to the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH on all matters concerning the law, position and interests of national minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The BiH National Minority Council is composed of 17 representatives of national minorities, one representative on behalf of each ethnic
minority.
The National Minority Council of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity was established in March 2016.
The National Minority Council of the Republika Srpska entity was established in 2005.
The National Minority Council of Sarajevo Canton was established in 2012, with extended powers of legislative initiative.
Associations.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina exists more than 100 national minority CSOs. Generally, associations operate individually or within the alliances. The Association of National Minorities of Republika Srpska (ANMRS) was established in 2003 as a voluntary and open non-partisan association of citizens. It gathers, as an umbrella organisations, 40 member associations of national minorities in Republika Srpska. 
Education in minority languages.
Italian and Ukrainian are taught in one and four schools respectively in the town of Prnjavor (15 and 24 pupils in total in 2015).
German, Russian, and Italian are taught as foreign languages in several high schools throughout the country.
Associations and embassies also organise several elective courses of minority languages as foreign languages.
Several newsletters and bulletins are published periodically in minority languages, including four in Slovene, and one each in Hungarian ("Új dobos"), Macedonian ("Vinozito"), Italian ("Stella d'Italia") and Czech ("Banjalucki Krajani")

1940 Turkish Football Championship

The 1940 Turkish Football Championship was the seventh edition of the competition. Eskişehir Demirspor won their first and only national championship title by defeating Fenerbahçe in the final. For Eskişehir Demirspor it was the club's first and sole appearance in the championship final.
After four years of interruption the championship was resumed again and was held in a new format. In 1937 the Turkish National Division was introduced, which was the national league contested by the top clubs of the three major leagues of Istanbul, Ankara, and İzmir. The remaining cities which were not included in the National Division played in regional qualification groups like in the previous years, with the group winners competing against each other in a play-off. The club winning the play-off in 1940, Eskişehir Demirspor, played against 1940 Turkish National Division winners Fenerbahçe. Eskişehir Demirspor defeated Fenerbahçe in the final and thus became the first Turkish champions from outside Istanbul and Ankara.

Daniel Gookin (pastor)

Daniel Gookin (12 July 1650 – 8 January 1717/18) was an American pastor. He was the Librarian of Harvard from 1674 to 1676 and from 1679 to 1681.
Early life.
Gookin, the son of Major-General Daniel Gookin and his wife Mary, was born at Cambridge, 12 July 1650. At the age of 19 he graduated at Harvard College with the class of 1669 and proceeded to his degree of Master of Arts. In May, 1673, he " was chosen probationr , &amp; is forthwith to take ye charge of a Classis," and in the fall his fellowship was confirmed by the Harvard Corporation. He remained a tutor and resident fellow for eight years. One of his pupils was Cotton Mather.
Career.
During this period he also twice served as Librarian, from 1674 to 1676 and 1679 to 1681. At a meeting of the Corporation, 11 December 1674, it was "Ordered further that hencforth Mr. Daniell Gookin be Library keeper : And that he enquire of persons formerly [con]cerned for finding out &amp; restoring the book[s] found wanting in the last surveigh ma[de] by the Praesidt : himself and Mr Sewal as in the Library book." In August, 1676, there was "paid mr Danl Gookin, one of the Fellowes, money 50s in Satisfaction for his paines in removing the library to the new Colledge &amp; placeing them." This was evidently extra work, for some months previously Daniel Allin had been appointed Librarian; perhaps in the removal of the books to the first Harvard Hall, then only partially completed, the new Librarian was glad to have the aid of his predecessor. Gookin, however, in June, 1679, was again " chosen Librarie keeper." Two months later the account-books of the College have the entry, "Paid to Jno Palfrey 36s on the president's note for 1 doz. Stooles made for Colledge Library." The following winter there is a record of payments of over 20 for freight on eleven boxes of books for the Library; probably these were the library of the English philologist and divine, Theophilus Gale, then recently bequeathed to the College.
In 1681, resigning his positions at Cambridge, Gookin began his services as a minister. He assisted the Apostle Eliot in his work among the Indians at Natick, and is described by him as " a pious and worthy young man." In Natick Gookin preached in English without learning the Nipmuc language, so the Natick congregation requested a translator be allowed, so Daniel Takowompait, an indigenous pastor, was selected as a pastor there. In March, 1685, he was ordained pastor of the church at Sherborn, with an annual salary of "twenty pounds in money and twenty pounds in country pay." Here Gookin preached for many years, both to his parishioners and to the Indians, and here his death occurred, after a long illness, 8 January 1717/18. William Rider of Natick wrote to the editor of the "News-Letter" as follows :
"The Reverend, learned and pious Mr. Daniel Gookin deceased, aged about 67 years :
who in his younger Time was a Fellow of Harvard College about the space of seven years ; and
since has been an Ordained Minister in said Town about 34 years ; who many years preached the " Indian Lectures at Natick " ; a Gentleman sound in his Doctrine, explaining the Scriptures to the weakest Capacity, and painfull in his Studies, tender of his Flock, and Exemplary in his Life, and Lamented of all Good Men that had Acquaintance with him, especially in his own Church and Town." And his friend Sewall notes in his Diary : " He was a good Scholar, and a solid Divine. We were Fellows together at College, and have sung many a Tune in Consort ; hope shall sing Hallelujah together in Heaven."
Personal life.
Gookin married, first in 1681, Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Quincy, whose father Edmund had become by that time the husband of Daniel's sister Elizabeth, the widow of John Eliot, and second, in 1692, Bethia, daughter of Edward Collicott or Richard Callicott. Gookin had seven children (Daniel, Mary, Edmund and Elizabeth by his first wife, and Bethia, Nathaniel, and Richard by his second wife).
Daniel Gookin never published anything, but there exists a printed catalogue of his library, which was sold, together with that of Joshua Moody, in 1718.

David Scondras (January 5, 1946 – October 21, 2020) was a member of the Boston City Council, having held the District 8 seat from 1984 through 1993. He was one of a few members of the Democratic Socialists of America to be elected to public office.
Political career.
Scondras ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 1981, the last election when all seats were at-large. He ran successfully in November 1983, winning the seat for District 8 (Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Mission Hill, and Fenway–Kenmore) and becoming the first openly gay Boston City Council member. He was re-elected to four two-year terms, before being defeated in the November 1993 election by Thomas M. Keane Jr. by just 27 votes (3,649–3,622). Leading up to that election, Scondras failed to receive the endorsement of Boston's LGBT-oriented newspaper, "Bay Windows", who wrote that he was "out of step with the changing gay community."
Personal life.
Scondras was born in 1946 in Lowell, Massachusetts, and graduated from Lowell High School. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1968, a master's degree in economics from Northeastern University in 1974, and was an instructor in those topics at Northeastern from 1968 through 1987. In 1987, he founded a non-profit organization, Search For A Cure, focused on the development of HIV therapies. He was the author of a four-book autobiography titled "Angels, Liars, and Thieves", released from 2015 through 2017.
In 2007, Scondras pleaded guilty to child enticement, stemming from a 2006 event in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He was sentenced to 18 months’ probation, ordered to surrender his computer and register as a sex offender, and stay off the Internet and away from children younger than 16. Scondras later sued the city of Lawrence, charging them with cruel and unusual punishment and assault and battery. In his autobiography, Scondras characterized the event as "being beaten and arrested for not having sex with a boy who did not exist." His lawsuit was dismissed in 2011 because it lacked sufficient evidence.
Scondras died in October 2020. He had battled polycystic kidney disease.

Maratón de los Cuentos

The Maratón de los Cuentos (Storytelling Marathon) is an oral narration that takes place every year in the palacio del Infantado de Guadalajara (Spain) during the second or third weekend of June. The festival gather storytellers or cuentacuentos from around the world who narrate uninterruptedly stories over the weekend. Started in 1992, the Maratón de los Cuentos of Guadalajara is celebrated every year since then. It reached its twentieth edition in 2011 achieving 46 hours of storytelling without interruption. It brings together 200 volunteers who help develop more than 70 activities.
History.
The Marathon was born as one of the projects created by Blanca Calvo, director of the Library of Guadalajara, when in 1982 she promoted the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, which in addition to the Marathon organized the National Encounters of Animation of Reading between 1984-1996
The first edition was held on April 23, 1992 as part of the activities program of the Guadalajara Book Fair, which included oral narration. That first edition lasted 24 hours, from 12 noon on Friday to 12 on Saturday, with the goal in turn to enter the Guinness Book of Records. In this marathon participated personalities such as Antonio Buero Vallejo and José Luis Sampedro.
In 1993 the Marathon was held for the first time in the palace of the Infantado and reached 36 and a half hours.
Since then, and thanks to the collaboration of the Seminary of Children and Youth Literature of Guadalajara, it ended up defining what is now known as the "Marathon of the Tales of Guadalajara", which takes place in the courtyard of the Lions of the Palace of Infantado uninterrupted during the weekend.
In 2016 the festival reached a quarter of a century by telling stories and it is considered as the largest festival of oral narration, aimed at children and adults, adolescents, storytellers and curious in general and known as the world capital of the story.
After 25 years, the festival declared to be working to be part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity granted by UNESCO.
Event locations.
The palace of the Infantado de Guadalajara has hosted the event since 1993 and is specially decorated for the occasion. Inside, in the Patio de los Leones, the main courtyard, the marathon of oral narration is developed as well as the marathon of illustration, and in the hall, a smaller courtyard at the entrance of the Palacio del Infantado is told stories by more accountants novices or more timid. The entrance hall also houses the main story marathon in case of bad weather, since this courtyard is interior which allows the marathon not to be suspended until its program ends on Sunday, when the concert of the end of the Marathon, also developed in the hall of the palace of the Infantado.
The gardens of the Palace of the Infantado host some activities, although mainly there are several stalls where you can buy books or stalls where you can buy traditional products or have tea. Also in front of the Palacio del Infantado are some stalls with the same objective, as well as activities and shows at different times.
The Plaza del Jardinillo de Guadalajara and the Plaza Mayor de Guadalajara as well as the main street also tend to host some activities and shows.
Among the locations of the event have also included the Chinese Hall of the Cotilla Palace, the Palace of Antonio de Mendoza (Liceo Caracense) or the crypt of the Church of San Francisco.
All locations participating in the event are decorated for the occasion.
Marathons included in the event.
There are different activities that are performed in parallel to the Maratón de los Cuentos, like the oral narration marathon, the illustration, radio and photography marathons.
Oral Narration marathon.
Multitude of professional and non-professional storytellers participate during the event telling stories, either alone or accompanied, with or without musical accompaniment, singing or narrating, interpreting history without more, dressed especially for it or even camouflaged behind puppets or puppets, any option is possible.
Illustration marathon.
Different illustrators from around the world are responsible for putting on paper the stories that storytellers are narrating during the weekend. The illustrations are hung in one of the corners of the patio of the lions of the palace of the Infantado so that all can approach to see them.
The illustrators also participate creating the poster of the event each year, which will serve to promote the same serving as an image for posters, shirts and badges in each edition.
Photography marathon.
The Photographic Group of Guadalajara makes this photographic follow-up creating an annual archive of the celebration and providing a souvenir to each participant of the Marathon.
Radio marathon.
Radio retransmission of the stories through Radio Arrebato, both by radio frequency and online at www.radioarrebato.net.
Music marathon.
Since 2002, and depending on the year, the music marathon is performed simultaneously in the gardens of the Infantado Palace.
Viernes de los cuentos.
The Friday of the stories is not included in the festival program, but it completes the story marathon by developing oral storytelling sessions for adults from October to May, including filandón on two of the Fridays during this period, reaching its 21st edition in 2017.
Editions of the Maratón de los Cuentos of Guadalajara.
Each year, the Maratón de los Cuentos assigns a theme that gives rise to a theme of the edition:

Astrobrachion adhaerens

Astrobrachion adhaerens is a basket star in the Euryalidae family. Along with "A. constrictum", it is one of only two species in the genus "Astrobrachion". Both species live in association with soft corals in moderately deep water. It is endemic to the west, north and east coasts of Australia, the Kermadec Islands and Lord Howe Island.
Euryalids are the least well known Ophiuroids. There is even lesser knowledge about "A. adhaerens" available. However it is closely related to its only sister species, "A. constrictum," and information about this species and the family as a whole can provide insight into the anatomy, morphology, reproduction, and suspension feeding habits of "A. adhaerens".
Taxonomy.
The taxonomy and phylogeny of species in the order Euryalida and class Ophiuroidea has been ambiguous and continues to be investigated.
Euryalid fossils date back to strata as young as Cretaceous and Neogene. In the past, the ophiuroids were classified as either euryalids or non-euryalids due to stark morphological differences.
Increased study in the areas of ophiuroid and euryalid historical morphology have revealed that Euryalids diverged from Ophiurids during the Triassic period, explaining why its ancestors shared some of the morphologies of the class Ophiuroidea.
Distribution and Habitat.
The genus Astrobrachion was first identified in New Zealand. Sister genera were identified in the Caribbean and Philippines.
"A. adhaerens" is found in the tropical regions of Australia, ranging from Albany, Western Australia and the northern Australian coast to New South Wales, Lord Howe Island and the Kermadec Islands. The species is allopatric except at Lord Howe Island.
Basket stars are found to reside on soft, cold water-corals such as the Nephtheidae soft corals at depths ranging from 25m to 1317m, especially on the Labrador, Newfoundland and Baffin Bay shelves. However low relative co-occurrence ranges (4%-54%) suggest that soft corals are not a necessary basket star habitat.
Anatomy and Morphology.
Basket stars have extensively branched arms made of a complex system of tissues and muscles. These arms are capable of regeneration, which is a characteristic that likely evolved as a response to frequent breaks of their long, thin, and fragile arms.
Genera in Euryalida typically have thick skin and possess lateral arm plates but rarely have ventral arm plates or dorsal arm plates. The genus Astrobrachion is set apart by having small ventral plates separated from the lateral arm by a supportive dermal tissue layer.
The length of arm spines on Astrobrachion is the same length as the corresponding arm segment, like its sister genus "Squamophis". These two genus, therefore, have the shortest spines in the Asteroschematidae family.
"A. adhaerens" has longitudinal stripes while its sister species "A. constrictum" has transverse color banding on the arms. Both species vary from red to yellowish-white in color.
Little is known of the reproductive system of "A. adhaerens", but sexual characteristics are likely shared with closely related "A. constrictum. A. constrictum" are dioecious and exhibit no sexual dimorphism. They have a fused bursae and long, tubular gonads in the proximal half of their arms. Somewhat unique to reproduction within species of the Asteroschematidae family is the structure of the germinal epithelium: folding over the testes in the male and concentric tapering of the germinal epithelium in the ovaries in the female.
Behaviour.
Very little of "A. adhaerens" behavior has been observed as their hard substrate, nocturnal activities and deep water habitat hinder the observation and collection of specimens. "A. adhaerens" are suspension feeders that unfold their long, thin arms to feed at night.

Prostitution in the British Overseas Territories

The British Overseas Territories (BOT) or alternatively, United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), are 14 territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are the parts of the British Empire that have not been granted independence or have voted to remain British territories. These territories do not form part of the United Kingdom. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel.
Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
The territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia are British military bases on the island of Cyprus. The large presence of British troops on the island led to laws on prostitution while Cyprus was under British administration.
Anguilla.
Prostitution is legal in Anguilla, but related activities such as brothel keeping, are illegal under sections 171 - 181 of the Criminal Code. Brothels are common on the island, and most villages have a 'sports bar' where prostitutes work. These bars have bedrooms at the back that the prostitutes use. Many of the prostitutes are from Venezuela. Law enforcement turns a blind eye to these activities.
In 2016, photojournalist Belinda Soncini produced a photo-blog of about the prostitutes on the island entitled 'Desperate Women: Venezuela's Latest Export'.
Bermuda.
Prostitution is legal in Bermuda but related activities such as running a brothel are illegal under the Criminal Code. Women coming to the island to work as prostitutes, or is a known prostitute, may be refused entry under the immigration laws. Many of the prostitutes in the country are from Philippines, Dominican Republic and Panama. In 2010 the visa requirements for people from these countries was changed to attempt to curb prostitution. Street prostitution occurs in the capital, Hamilton, on Front Street.
History.
Bermuda has a long history of prostitution fuelled by the British garrison and sailors visiting the island. One of the best known former brothels, "The Queen Of The East", was demolished in 2016. It was originally built in the 1740s. In 1968, when homosexuality was still outlawed in the Royal Navy, the 'Bermuda case' caused concern to naval authorities. The owner of a gay brothel on the island had recorded the names and ships of more than 400 sailors who had visited the brothel, potentially making them the targets for blackmail.
British Antarctic Territory.
The British Antarctic Territory is uninhabited except for research personnel.
British Indian Ocean Territory.
The islands of the British Indian Ocean Territory are uninhabited except for military personnel and contractors.
British Virgin Islands.
Prostitution is legal in the British Virgin Islands, but related activities such as soliciting and procuring are illegal. Known prostitutes or those known to be living off the proceeds of prostitution can be refused entry visas to the country. Prostitution occurs mainly in brothels and strip clubs, especially in the capital, Road Town. The National AIDS Programme distributes condoms and advice to the sex workers.
Cayman Islands.
Prostitution in the Cayman Islands is legal but related activities such as brothel keeping are prohibited by the Penal Code.
Falkland Islands.
Prostitution in the Falkland Islands is legal but related activities such as solicitation and keeping a brothel are prohibited by the Crimes Ordinance 2014. A man compelling his wife to become a prostitute is a grounds for divorce under the Matrimonial Proceedings (Summary Jurisdiction) Ordinance 1967. Soldiers returning from tours on the islands report little or no prostitution in the Falkland Islands.
Gibraltar.
Prostitution is illegal in Gibraltar, as are related activities.
History.
In 1725 there were about 1,000 Catholics and Jews living in Gibraltar (under British control since 1713), and about 100 British. Some of the British women were prostitutes.
The British military buildup on Gibraltar started during the Spanish siege of 1727. One diarist noted that in that year there was much excitement as a ship was due in from Ireland with prostitutes on board.
In the 19th century, the military authorities in charge took the view prostitution was inevitable where soldiers and sailors were stationed. A rescindable permit was required by non-British people to enter and reside in Gibraltar. The permits were only issued to prostitutes if they agreed to a weekly medical examination. Failure to comply once in Gibraltar would result in the permit being withdrawn. British prostitutes in Gibraltar were brought into the scheme by withdrawing permits to any alien prostitutes who they resided with if the British prostitute didn't accompany them to the examination. The police kept a close scrutiny on the brothels and the prostitutes. By the end of the 19th century, prostitution had centred around a street called Seruya's Ramp, known locally as Calle Peligro. By this time most of the prostitutes were Spanish nationals. In 1892 it was noted by an official in the Colonial Office that 47 'native' prostitutes was too few to service the needs of the 4,926 men in the garrison plus sailors from ships docked in the harbour.
When the brothels were shut down and prostitution banned by Governor Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in January 1922, the prostitutes moved across the Spanish border to the "Calle Gibraltar" area in La Línea.
Montserrat.
Prostitution in Montserrat is legal and common. However related activities such as controlling prostitution or living off the earnings of prostitution are prohibited by the Penal Code.
Following the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano in 1997 that buried the capital, Plymouth, many migrant workers came to the island from Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. With them came prostitutes, especially from the Dominican Republic, and prostitution on the island increased.
Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands.
The Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands are virtually uninhabited.
Apart from involvement in child prostitution, there are no prostitution laws on the Pitcairn Islands.
The population of the islands is estimated at 50. However, in the late 1930s, when the population reached its highest of 250, the pastor of the islands complained to the High Commissioner that prostitution on the islands was "very common."
Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.
No information available.
South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
The South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have no permanent inhabitants.
Turks and Caicos Islands.
Prostitution is common on the Turks and Caicos Islands, especially in Providenciales. Many of the sex workers are from Eastern Europe and the Dominican Republic. There is some female sex tourism on the islands. Sex trafficking and HIV are problems in the country.

Superfly (boxing)

Superfly was a series of professional boxing cards centered around the super flyweight division.
History.
The concept was created by promoter Tom Loeffler and has been broadcast on HBO Boxing After Dark. The events were originally meant to showcase Román González, regarded as the best active boxer, pound for pound, at the time. But the two events to date have been headlined by Srisaket Sor Rungvisai, following his knockout win over the former at the first installment of the series.
Historically, American audiences have rarely been interested in fighters at lower weight classes. However, the Superfly events are built to showcase several of the best fighters at super flyweight and adjacent divisions.
Events.

Fotografia (Antônio Carlos Jobim song)

"Fotografia" (also known as "Photograph") is a bossa nova song written and composed in 1959 by Antônio Carlos Jobim. English lyrics were published in 1965 by Ray Gilbert.
"Fotografia" was one of Jobim's first compositions for which he wrote the words as well as the music. According to author Ruy Castro, this came about partly because Jobim's songwriting partner, Vinicius de Moraes, had left Rio de Janeiro to take up a diplomatic post in Montevideo, Uruguay, during much of 1958 and 1959. The change allowed Jobim to work with other lyricists, such as close friend Newton Mendonça, Dolores Duran and Aloísio de Oliveira, and to try his hand at penning his own lyrics.
Jazz critic Gary Giddins, writing in The New Yorker, referred to "Fotografia" as an "ingenious" composition full of "flirtatious romance," while Mark Holston at Jazziz Magazine said the song was "mesmerizing." Thom Jurek at AllMusic called it "a tome of memory and longing."
Brazilian vocalist Flora Purim, who recorded "Fotografia" on her 2001 album "Perpetual Emotion", discussed the background of the song in an interview on National Public Radio, saying, "in Brazil it's very common, all those illegal love affairs, people that are married but fall in love with other people that are married. So they would meet in the afternoon and be together until sunset, and then they'd have to go home to their families. And this song talks about a romance between two people and suddenly that kiss, you know, that goodbye kiss, 'I have to go now.' It’s a song about forbidden love. . . . about love affairs in the late afternoon."
"Fotografia" has been used as the title of other Jobim-related albums, including Wanda Sá's 2014 Jobim tribute album, and a 2005 compilation from Planet Rhythm (Universal) entitled "Fotografia: Os Años Dourados de Tom Jobim" that includes rarities, outtakes, and previously unreleased tracks.
The first recording of "Fotografia" was by Sylvia Telles in 1959, on her album "Amor De Gente Moça (Musicas De Antonio Carlos Jobim)".
Jobim recorded the song himself as an English-language vocal on his 1967 album, "A Certain Mr. Jobim".

2018 Oregon State Beavers baseball team

The 2018 Oregon State Beavers baseball team represented Oregon State University in the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Beavers played their home games at Goss Stadium at Coleman Field and were members of the Pac-12 Conference. The team was coached by Pat Casey in his 24th and final season at Oregon State. The Beavers began the season ranked #2 by Baseball America and were unanimously selected by Pac-12 coaches to repeat as conference champions.
They won their third national championship by defeating Arkansas in the 2018 College World Series. It was only the second time in College World Series history that a team won the championship after losing their first game of the tournament and the first game of the championship series. The first team to do that was the 2006 Oregon State Beavers.
Season.
On March 11th, head coach Pat Casey was suspended by the NCAA for 4 games as a result of contact made on March 9th with third base umpire Mark Buchanan while disputing a check-swing call against a Cal State Fullerton batter. Casey was ejected following the contact and the game resulted in the Beavers' first loss of the season 3–5. Associate head coach Pat Bailey led the team during Casey's suspension.
Entering into the final game of the regular season against UCLA Oregon State found itself game behind for the Pac-12 crown. A win against UCLA coupled with a Stanford loss to Washington, who was also in contention for the league championship, would have given the Beavers their second straight Pac-12 championship. Oregon State would go on to lose against UCLA and Stanford rallied to win against Washington to give them their first Pac-12 championship since 2004.
In the postseason tournament the Beavers were selected as the #3 overall national seed, which guaranteed home field advantage for both the Regionals and Super Regionals. Only defending national champion Florida (#1) and Pac-12 champion Stanford (#2) were seeded higher.

Oregon State vs North Carolina (Game 1)
On June 16, 2018, Oregon State dropped the opening game of the CWS to North Carolina by a score of 8–6. Oregon State was first on the board when Trevor Larnach tripled in the bottom of the 1st to drive in leadoff batter Steven Kwan. The Tarheels matched the Beavers 1–1 in the 2nd, before taking a commanding 6–1 lead in the top of the 3rd. This marked the first time all season Oregon State gave up 6 runs in the first 3 innings. A controversial safe call at third base in the top of the 7th helped sustain The Tarheels inning, when Beavers' 3rd baseman Gretler appeared to tag Tarheels runner Martorano, but was ruled safe. Instant replay would say otherwise, but the call was non-reviewable. Martorano was driven in by the next batter, increasing the Tarheels lead to 7–4. 
Oregon State vs Washington (Game 5)
On June 18, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Washington Huskies in the first elimination game of the CWS by a score of 14–5. This marked the 4th meeting between the two conference rivals this season, with Oregon State leading the series 2–1. Washington took a 3–0 lead in the bottom of the 3rd, before giving up 4 runs and surrendering the lead in the top of the 5th. Washington was quick to respond, taking a 5–4 lead before a -hour rain delay in the top of the 6th. Washington walked in the tying run after play resumed in the 6th, and would be shutout for the remainder of the game. Lead-off hitter Steven Kwan injured his hamstring while at bat in the top of the 3rd inning. Kwan would sit out the majority of the College World Series, starting only the opening game of the finals against Arkansas.
Oregon State vs North Carolina (Game 9)
On June 20, 2018, Oregon State defeated the North Carolina Tarheels in an elimination game by a score of 11–6. The Beavers jumped out to an early 3–0 lead, before the Tarheels tied the game in the bottom of a 3rd with the assist of a controversial fair ball call. The hit drove in 2 runs and was deemed non-reviewable. Oregon State trailed 6–3 in the top of the 8th with 1 out, before Adley Rutchman crushed a base hit double to center field, driving in 3 runs to tie the game 6–6. The Beavers continued to pile on runs into the 8th inning, while shutting the Tarheels out for the remainder of the game. 
Oregon State vs Mississippi St (Game 11)
On June 22, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs by a score of 12–2. Mississippi State appeared to have the blessings of the College Baseball Gods throughout the tournament, staving off five elimination games before arriving in Omaha. Mississippi State quickly put up 1 run in the top of the 1st, and but failed to establish their presence for the remainder of the game. Oregon State went on a hitting frenzy with a barrage of runs in the 2nd and 7th inning. In the 7th inning, head coach Pat Casey sent his son, Joe Casey, to pinch hit for Tyler Malone. Casey dug a pitch out of the ground for a base hit over 2nd and his first CWS RBI.
Oregon State vs Mississippi St (Game 13)
On June 23, 2018, Oregon State defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs by a score of 5–2. The Beavers scored all 5 runs with 2 outs in the top of the 3rd, the final three runs coming on DH Tyler Malone's home run. The Bulldogs appeared to have regained favor of the College Baseball Gods with a last minute rally brewing in the bottom of the 9th, as Oregon State pitcher, Jake Mulholland, loaded the bases with a 5–2 lead and Jordan Westburg at bat. Westburg was fresh off a CWS Grand Slam against North Carolina, and was looking to become the first player ever to hit 2 CWS Grand Slams. Westburg blasted a grounder to shortstop Cadyn Grenier, which appeared to be glued to the inside of Grenier's glove, before finding its way to 2nd baseman Nick Madrigal for the final out.
Oregon State vs Arkansas (Game 14)
On June 26, 2018, the Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the Oregon State Beavers, 4–1, in the opening game of the CWS Finals. The CWS Finals were scheduled to begin on the previous day, but were delayed due to rain, giving Oregon State an extra day to rest their bullpen. This defeat marked Oregon State's first loss to an SEC team all season, and the first loss to an SEC team since losing game 2 of the CWS Semi Finals to LSU in 2017. 
The game was marred by a controversial interference call which lead to a double play and took a run off the board for the Beavers. Oregon State was unable to recover from the shift in momentum, going scoreless for the remainder of the game. 
Oregon State vs Arkansas (Game 15)
On June 27, 2018, Oregon State defeated Arkansas 5–3 to even the series 1–1. Arkansas appeared in complete control of the game, and on their way to certain victory, when Arkansas missed a game winning pop-up foul ball off the bat of Cadyn Grenier in the top of the 9th. The ball fell between the first base line and the wall, with the first baseman, right fielder, and second baseman honing in on the game sealing pop-up. The second baseman, Carson Shaddy, bumped first baseman Jared Gates while running towards the ball, causing Gates to take his eye off the ball, Shaddy to overrun the ball, and right fielder Eric Cole to pull up. The ball landed foul between the 3 Arkansas players, giving Oregon State a second chance. Cadyn Grenier knocked in the game-tying run 2 pitches later. Trevor Larnach came to the plate with Arkansas still in shock, boasting the most home runs of the season for the Beavers, and hit a two-run shot over the head of Cole to win the game, 5–3.
Oregon State vs Arkansas (Game 16)
On June 28, 2018, Oregon State defeated Arkansas, 5–0, to win their third College World Series championship. Oregon State pitcher Kevin Abel worked himself into a jam in the top of the 3rd, loading the bases with one out against the Razorbacks, before going on to retire 20 batters in a row. Abel became the first pitcher to win four games in the CWS, and two games in the CWS Finals. He pitched only the 4th complete game shutout in a championship game, with the lowest hit total of those games (2). Oregon State catcher Adley Rutchman set the CWS hits record during this game, with 17 hits. Rutchman won the CWS Most Outstanding Player Award.
Major League Baseball Draft.
In the 2018 Major League Baseball draft Nick Madrigal became the highest draft pick in Oregon State history when the Chicago White Sox selected him with the 4th pick of the 1st Round. The previous record holder was Michael Conforto, who was selected 10th overall by the New York Mets in the 2014 MLB draft. 
Pitcher Drew Rasmussen, who missed the entire 2018 season due to undergoing his second Tommy John surgery, was originally selected 31st overall in the 2017 MLB draft by the Tampa Bay Rays but was unable to come to terms with the team before the July 7th deadline. He was later denied free agency by Major League Baseball.
Two-time Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year, Luke Heimlich, went undrafted for the second straight year. The Texas Rangers announced a month before the draft that they would not select the winningest pitcher in Oregon State history after it was revealed Heimlich pled guilty to sexually molesting a family member when he was 15. Heimlich has since denied the allegations to which he pled guilty as a juvenile saying the guilty plea was "a decision me and my parents thought was the best option to move forward as a family."

Pierre-Louis Loubet

Pierre-Louis Loubet (born 18 February 1997) is a French rally driver. He is the 2019 World Rally Championship 2 Champion. He is the son of the 1989 European Rally Champion Yves Loubet.
Career.
Early career.
Loubet started karting at 7 years old at the Figari circuit, close to his Porto-Vecchio family residence. After a year of Formula Renault in 2014, he switches to rallying after obtaining his drivers license. 
Beginnings in rallying (2015).
Loubet made his entry into world rallying in the JWRC category in Portugal, where he would finish 2nd in his category with Victor Belotto as a co-driver. After retirements in Finland and Poland, he started the 2015 Tour de Corse with new co-driver Vincent Landais, but would also retire from the rally. He would finish the year with a 5th place in Catalunya and 4th in Wales. He would finish the year 6th overall in the 2015 Junior World Rally Championship.
Initial WRC2 Campaign (2016).
Pierre-Louis started the 2016 WRC-2 campaign on a Peugeot 207 S2000 in Portugal with a retirement, before switching to a Citroën DS3 R5 run by PH Sport. He would then go on to score several points finishes in Sardinia, Poland and Corsica in WRC2, before scoring a podium in Catalunya in the RC2 category.
M-Sport (2017).
Starting the year with PH Sport in Sweden, he retired due to an engine failure and duly switched to M-Sport and the Ford Fiesta R5, alongside Eric Camilli and Teemu Suninen before Corsica. This would be marked as a consistent year with many points finishes (4th in Catalunya being the best result), but with no podiums. 
Hyundai / BRC Racing Team (2018).
Hoping to take a step up in 2018, Loubet switched to the new Hyundai i20 R5, driving for BRC Racing Team. He started the year with a limited FIA ERC campaign in the Azores and Canary Islands, both of which were impacted by mechanical and electronical failures, but with a decent pace to show for it. After more issues in Corsica, he would finish a season-best 4th in Portugal, with retirements being the theme of the season in Italy, Germany and Wales.
First title (2019).
Loubet started 2019 as he had done in 2018 with a two-event European Rally Championship campaign, again in the Azores and Canary Islands. He would have to retire before the final stage with an alternator belt failure, despite being on the podium. In the Canary Islands, a false start penalty would demote him from 3rd to 5th place, but the pace shown in the Skoda was promising. He arrived to Corsica hoping to take a good result at his rally, but small issues would hinder his pace, and he would finish 10th in class. Starting with Portugal however, he went on a consistent and quick pace to win Portugal and Sardinia. He would then go on to finish 4th in Finland. After the summer break, he battled it out with Petter Solberg at Wales Rally GB, finishing 2nd and taking the championship lead. He would then finish 4th in Catalunya, narrowly missing out on clinching the title. The decision had been made to enter Rally Australia for a final round showdown against Benito Guerra, however, following the widespread bushfires in New South Wales, the rally would be cancelled, crowning Loubet as champion with a 3-point advantage over Kajetan Kajetanowicz.

Bertrand Fagalde

Marie Bertrand Alfred Fagalde (22 July 1878, Boghar, Algeria - 6 February 1966, Garches, Paris) was a French Army officer.
Life.
He studied at the École de guerre between 1905 and 1907, graduating top of his class. He was promoted to captain on 24 June 1910. He was on the staff of the 5th Army on the outbreak of the First World War. An Anglophile, he was sent to London as a liaison officer in 1917. By the war's end he had reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
On 19 June 1939 he was promoted to général de corps d'armée and assigned to 16th Army Corps in 7th Army. He fought in Flanders in May and June 1940 and also took part in the battle of Dunkirk, commanding the western perimeter defence alongside French Admiral Abrial whilst the British General Ronald Forbes Adam of III Corps commanded the eastern British sector of the perimeter. Fagalde was made a Grand Officier of the Légion d'honneur by Maxime Weygand on 4 June for his conduct during the battle, but was captured on 18 June and imprisoned in Königstein Castle near Dresden in eastern Germany.
He was liberated by the Soviet Army on 9 May 1945 but just after his return to France he was indicted for "intelligence with the enemy" or "acts harming national defence" during his captivity. He was accused of having asked to join the Waffen SS for unknown reasons, although he was held to have retracted the offer when he found out he would have to wear German uniform. He was found guilty and sentenced to five years' solitary confinement, loss of his rank and confiscation of his property. The case was later re-opened, all the accusations dropped and his reputation reinstated.

HD 2454

HD 2454 is a probable binary star system in the zodiac constellation of Pisces. With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.04, it is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye under good seeing conditions. An annual parallax shift of 27.36 mas as measured from Earth's orbit provides a distance estimate of 199 light years. It has a relatively high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at a rate of 0.208 arcseconds per year, and is moving closer to the Sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of −10 km/s.
The visible component of this system is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of , showing an abnormally strong line of singly-ionized strontium (Sr II) at a wavelength of 4077 Å. It has an estimated 1.23 times the mass of the Sun and 1.6 times the Sun's radius. The star is about 1.9 billion years old with a rotation period of around three days. It is radiating 4.6 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of around 6,508 K.
HD 2454 was the first star to be identified as a Barium dwarf, by Tomkin et al. (1989), and is the brightest such object. It displays a mild overabundance of the element barium, which is hypothesized to have been accreted when an unresolved white dwarf companion was passing through the asymptotic giant branch (RGB) stage.
The visible component displays significant overabundances of three s-process peak elements that are generated during the RGB phase, as well as a mild overabundance of carbon. In contrast, it shows severe depletion of lithium and beryllium, as well as a notable underabundance of boron. The surface abundances of these lighter elements may have been altered during the mass transfer process, having been previously consumed in the core region of the companion.

The company was founded in 1989. The purpose of the company is to hatch hybrid hens, which lay more than 250 eggs a year, which are imitating the non-hybrid species of hens, which do not die permaturely, which are not aggressive, which are well feathered and which are all the same size. The hybrids are always hatched from two non-hybridized hens. The hens start to lay eggs in the 20th–23rd week of their life. Excluding the Czech Republic, it works in 49 more countries in the world. Hens hatched by this company are favorite, because of their easy breeding and higher egg-laying and lifetime unlike other hens.
In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Dominant CZ established 12 new species of hens, including seven special greenshell species and one special blackshell species.

Emanuel Rubin

Emanuel Rubin (December 5, 1928 – February 13, 2021) was an American pathologist known for his contributions to the study of liver disease, cardiomyopathy and alcoholic tissue injury, and as the editor of "Rubin’s Pathology", a medical textbook first published in 1988, now in its eighth edition.
Early life and education.
Dr. Rubin obtained a B.S. degree from Villanova University in 1950, and an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1954. He served as an officer in the U.S. Navy from 1955 to 1957. Subsequently, he trained in pathology at the Mount Sinai Hospital from 1958 to 1962. He was married twice, and had six children.
Career.
Rubin joined the attending staff of Mt. Sinai Hospital in 1962.  He was appointed Professor of Pathology in 1968, and Chairman of the Department in 1972, at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. In 1977, he moved to Philadelphia, where he was Chairman of Pathology at Drexel University Medical School. In 1986, he transferred to the Jefferson Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. He was also appointed Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1987. In 2004, Rubin was named Distinguished Professor of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology and Chairman Emeritus of the Jefferson Department.
Rubin has authored numerous original contributions in the fields of liver disease, cardiomyopathy and alcoholic tissue injury. His work has been based on clinical studies of patients, volunteers and laboratory investigations of the effects of alcohol on cells and organs. Rubin originally demonstrated that primary biliary cirrhosis is an inflammatory lesion of bile ducts. His early work refuted concept that liver disease in alcoholics is caused by nutritional deficiencies, which led to the erroneous term “nutritional cirrhosis”. In rodents, sub-human primates and human volunteers he showed that excessive alcohol consumption is toxic to the liver independent of nutritional factors, a fact that serves as the basis of alcohol research today. Subsequently, Rubin and colleagues demonstrated the profound effects of alcohol on cell membranes, mitochondria, and other cell constituents. In a series of papers, together with co-workers in Spain, he determined that (1) alcoholic cardiomyopathy correlated with the lifetime dose of alcohol, (2) women were more susceptible to the cardiac effects of alcohol, and (3) alcoholic liver and heart diseases occurred concurrently.
Rubin was the founder and editor of "Rubin’s Pathology", a textbook first published in 1988, now in its eighth edition.

Bledius annularis

Bledius annularis, or ringed borrow rove beetle, is a species of spiny-legged rove beetle in the family Staphylinidae. It is found in North America.
The lectotype for this taxon from a male specimen, collected from Lake Superior, and is housed within the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University.
Habitat and distribution.
Within New Brunswick, "B. annularis" is characteristically known to frequent damp clay riverbanks and shaded streams.
A number of closely related species of "Bledius" are commonly grouped together and referred to as the ""annularis" complex", then further subdivided into the ""annularis" group". This 'complex' of difficult to distinguish species is distributed right across northern North America, and consists of "B. annularis, B. breretoni, B. honestus, B. languidus, B.mysticus, B. nebulosus, B. sinuatus, B. stabilis," and "B. washingtonensis".
Description.
The beetle is slender and elongate in appearance, measuring between 3.8 mm and 4.5 mm. Its head and thorax, as well as the tip of its abdomen are all black in colour, whilst the base of its abdomen, its elytra and its antennae are reddish-brown. Its legs are dark yellow. Its head is lightly granulate and also finely punctate. The thorax is not as wide as it is long, whilst the base of the abdomen is narrower than the elytra. The abdomen of this beetle sometimes appears slightly banded as a result of the hind margins of the upper (dorsal) segments being slightly darker in colour.

Destination memory

Destination memory refers to the process of remembering to whom one has told information. When you are speaking to someone and forget whether or not you have previously told the person the information, you are experiencing an error in destination memory. The medial temporal lobe is critical for successful destination memory because it is this region of the brain that controls our episodic memory, which includes destination memory. The neurological processes responsible for destination memory are impaired by normal aging and are significantly affected by Alzheimer's disease. In addition to being an interesting neurological process, destination memory error can cause awkward social interactions and social embarrassment.
The discovery that older adults not only remembered fewer words, but also tended to repeat the same words more frequently prompted the first studies of destination memory. This experiment opened the door to investigating what we now call destination memory. Gopie &amp; MacLeod are not only responsible for coining the term "destination memory", but for initiating the beginning of many research experiments to further our understanding of memory error.
Destination memory plays a critical role in our episodic memory. It is considered an autobiographical memory because the information is recollected and remembered regarding oneself as a participant in a specific situation. Because humans are social creatures, our ability to communicate efficiently and effectively is important; therefore, remembering to whom we have told information is an important skill for successful social interactions.
Neurological aspect.
The medial temporal lobe is critical for successful destination memory. fMRI scans have demonstrated that the medial temporal lobe is involved with recollection-based memory, which includes destination memory. Mugijura et al. conducted an experiment in which subjects were asked to memorize a short fact when it appeared on a computer screen and then tell it to either a man or a woman. Later the participants were asked to recall which fact they told to which person and how confident (either high or low) they were in their answer. The subjects participated in both a practice round and second round in which they were monitored by a fMRI. Due to the activity displayed on the fMRI scans in the medial temporal lobe of the brain, they concluded that this region is critical for remembering to whom you have told information.
Aging.
Older adults have disproportionately impaired destination memory when compared to younger adults, which is due to the process of normal aging. Gopie, Craik, and Hasher coined the term destination amnesia to refer to this deterioration in destination memory. It is unclear as to what is specifically responsible for destination amnesia during aging; however, it is speculated that it is due to the general decline in memory. One's theory of mind ability is a significant predictor of destination memory ability in aging adults, as they both are positively correlated and depend upon executive functioning. Little research has been conducted to understand why destination memory deteriorates or what could slow the demise; however, older adults demonstrate improved destination memory performance when relaying information to an emotional face rather than a neutral face. Emotion improves destination memory performance for older adults as they continue to age, with negative emotions providing a greater impact. More research must be conducted to better understand ways to improve this memory error in order to prevent deterioration from aging.
Alzheimer's disease.
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition in which brain cells degenerate and die, leading to a steady destruction of one's memory and important mental functions. Because Alzheimer's disease has been shown to significantly affect episodic memory, researchers sought to understand how Alzheimer's disease affects destination memory, since it plays a critical role in our episodic memory. El Haj, Gandolphe, Allain, Fasotti, and Antoine found that those with Alzheimer's demonstrated poor performance in destination memory due to their inability to suppress appropriate versus inappropriate information during the memory retrieval process of their experiment. In addition to studying episodic memory, El Haj, Gély-Nargeot and Raffard sought to investigate the relationship between destination memory in Alzheimer patients and theory of mind because both processes are cognitive abilities that support effective communication and are linked to episodic memory function. They found that Alzheimer patients demonstrated a decline in destination memory as well as 2nd order cognitive theory of mind (Mary thinks that John thinks that...), but not for 1st order cognitive theory of mind (John thinks that...). Just as destination memory ability declines with normal aging, it is also negatively affected by Alzheimer's disease.
Social consequences.
Destination memory is critical for social interactions. Remembering to whom one has told information is expected and necessary for successful social interactions. Destination memory error can lead to social embarrassment when repeating stories to someone who has already heard them. While the fleeting emotion of social embarrassment may not be viewed as a serious mistake; destination memory can pose more serious issues in society. Including times when a supervisor delegates a specific task to an employee or when a professor forgets to whom they have given a specific responsibility. Errors like these can result in a diffusion of responsibility or an inability to accomplish necessary daily activities. Additionally, destination memory error can result in problematic situations for liars, as the inability to remember to whom they have told a story could result in getting caught in telling incongruent stories. Destination memory is necessary for successful communication.

Anna Haight

Anna Haight (2 October 1834 - 29 March 1898), was First Lady of California, being wife of Henry Haight, Governor from 1867 to 1871.
Life.
Anna Haight was born Anna Bissell on 2 October 1834 in St. Louis to Captain Lewis Bissell and his wife, the former Mary Woodbridge. Captain Bissell built the house in which Anna grew up; Lewis Bissell House (1820), now a restaurant and banquet facility, is considered to be the oldest surviving house in St. Louis. Anna met Henry Haight, a San Francisco attorney, in St. Louis, and married him on 24 January 1855. They sailed from New York on 20 February, bound for San Francisco. They had five children, Janette, Mary, Dugald, Henry H., Jr. and Louis.
The Haights were the last family to use the Stanford Mansion as the Governor's residence. Anna died on 29 March 1898 in Oakland, California and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

Denise Benoît

Denise Benoît (10 September 1919 – 29 May 1973) was a French actress and singer, active across a wide range of genres on the stage, radio and television. Other members of her family were musicians.
Life and career.
From a family of musicians, she was a daughter, grand-daughter and great-grand-daughter of musicians. Her mother (Léontine Benoît-Granier, died 1957) was a musician and composer who won prizes at the Paris Conservatoire, while her father Henri Benoît was a notable viola player in Paris, who was a member of the Capet Quartet in the 1920s, participating in several of their recordings during that period. Her brother, Jean-Christophe Benoît (born 1925) was a popular and much recorded baritone. Born Denise Marie Armande Frédérique Benoît in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, Denise spent the bulk of her career there, and died in the same city while still active.
Denise Benoît began learning the violin at the age of three from her father, later continuing with her mother. As a young woman, she began her professional life playing in Parisian theatre orchestras; while at the Théâtre Marigny a man looked into the pit and asked her whether she would not prefer to be playing on stage rather below it. Through several theatrical contacts she became the student of Jean Meyer, spent a year the Conservatoire and began her acting career in 1942. Her break-through came with an "unforgettable" portrayal of Natalia Stepenovna in "A Marriage Proposal" by Tchekhov. Her first role, in "Sixième étage", was as a cleaning lady, and this debut tended to type-cast her for some time as servants, concierges and domestics. On screen she became restricted to being a secretary, a domestic and a waitress, and so began to refuse this type of role.
In 1945 while a student of André Brunot at the Conservatoire d'art dramatique in Paris she took part in a televised play by Courteline; at the time she was only recognized as an actress, with her singing career yet to begin. In the 1950s, living in the Boulevard Malesherbes, Paris, already well-known on disc, she had facilities for recording at her apartment.
Léontine, Jean-Christophe and Denise appeared together on record in some of the 'Chants de France' folksong series on Ducretet-Thomson. The extensive series of records of folk songs from around France was the brain-child of her mother Léontine, so it was natural that the family were at the centre of these recordings.
In the 1950s she began a long association with radio broadcasting, which at the time she expressed a preference for, including for ten years on the regular programme of Louis Ducreux. While taking a respite for the birth of her first child in the early 1950s, Joseph Kosma guided her in broadening her song repertoire and wrote a few for her. After this, a career in cabaret began, with appearances at L'Écluse on the Left Bank, and she sang at other venues until the birth of a daughter in 1957.

Awbube

Awbube (Amharic: ኣውቡበ, ), (), (also spelt "Awbuube"), called after its patron Saint "Awbube", also known as Alaua or Halaua, is an ancient and ruined town located in the western Fafan Zone in the Somali region of Ethiopia. It is located 34 km northwest of Borama, the capital city of the Awdal Region in Somaliland via Quljeed, then across the border into the Awbare district in Ethiopia.
History.
Awbube is an ancient town in the Awbare district. It was a center of activity during the Golden Age of the Adal Sultanate. Called after its patron Somali Saint and Hero Awbube, known as the "Flying Saint", who was instrumental in the spread of the Islamic faith into the Abyssinian hinterlands, a hero of many early battles which some accounts mention was against the Ethiopian Empire and earlier inhabitants of the region. He was mentioned by name in "Futuh al Habasha" where the armies would visit his tomb and seek blessings through him and his family in their battles against the Portuguese and Abyssinian armies. 
Shihab al-Din Ahmad mentions the Patron Saint Awbube by name in his famous book "Futuh al Habasha." He states:
"When the two columns of soldiers that were proceeding on the road came into eachother's view, the idol-worshippers mounted a charge against the rear guard of the Muslims. Those in the rear guard held their ground, and mounted their horses. Among those in the rear was Zaharbui Utman, the sharif Ahmad and the hegano 'Abd Allah, 'Ali Farasaham and the sheikh Kalil, a descendant of Aububah - may God bless us through him, Amen. They were ten knights, and the idol-worshippers were around two-hundred. The Muslims charged the idol-worshippers, and a bloody battle was engaged, until their forearms became exhausted." A huge conical elaborately shaped tomb has been built on top of the grave of the Patron Saint. According to historical accounts, both the celebrated patron Saints Awbare and Awbube hail from the ancient Dir clan family. Both the tombs of the celebrated patron Saints Awbare and Awbube are much frequented and under the protection of the local Gadabuursi Dir clan who dominate the region in which they are buried.
Captain H.G.C Swayne R.E. (1895) describes the areas near and around Awbube in the Gadabuursi country, in his book "Seventeen Trips Through Somaliland":
"In the Gadabursi country there is the ancient ruined town of Aubóba, and at the head of the Gáwa Pass, on a hill to the west, and about four hundred feet above it, are some massive ancient ruins, which must have once been a fort, commanding the pass. They are called Samawé, from the name of a sheikh whose tomb crowns the ruins. The hill-top is surrounded by parallel retaining walls built of dressed stone, rising in steps from the bottom. In some places the walls were six or eight feet high, and there were remains of extensive ancient buildings filling the enclosure. Surmounting the whole in the centre was the ruin of a building of cut stone, which appeared to be the sheikh’s tomb."
Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes the scene as he passed by to visit the tomb of Shaykh Awbube, in his book "First Footsteps in East Africa":
"Feeling somewhat restored by repose, I started the next day, “with a tail on” to inspect the ruins of Aububah. After a rough ride over stony ground we arrived at a grassy hollow, near a line of hills, and dismounted to visit the Shaykh Aububah’s remains. He rests under a little conical dome of brick, clay and wood, similar in construction to that of Zayla: it is falling to pieces, and the adjoining mosque, long roofless, is overgrown with trees, that rustle melancholy sounds in the light joyous breeze."
Richard Francis Burton (1856) describes an ancient conflict between the towns of Awbube and Darbiyah Kola (near Abasa, Awdal) in "First Footsteps in East Africa":
"After an hour’s ride we turned away from the Abbaso Fiumara and entered a basin among the hills distant about sixteen miles from the Holy Tree. This is the site of Darbiyah Kola — Kola’s Fort — so called from its Galla queen. It is said that this city and its neighbour Aububah fought like certain cats in Kilkenny till both were “eaten up:” the Gudabirsi fix the event at the period when their forefathers still inhabited Bulhar on the coast — about 300 years ago. If the date be correct, the substantial ruins have fought a stern fight with time. Remnants of houses cumber the soil, and the carefully built wells are filled with rubbish: the palace was pointed out to me with its walls of stone and clay intersected by layers of woodwork. The mosque is a large roofless building containing twelve square pillars of rude masonry, and the Mihrab, or prayer niche, is denoted by a circular arch of tolerable construction. But the voice of the Muezzin is hushed for ever, and creepers now twine around the ruined fane. The scene was still and dreary as the grave; for a mile and a half in length all was ruins — ruins — ruins."
Richard Francis Burton (1856) also describes when he visited the battlefield:
"Thence we proceeded to the battle-field, a broad sheet of sandstone, apparently dinted by the hoofs of mules and horses: on this ground, which, according to my guides, was in olden days soft and yielding, took place the great action between Aububah and Darbiyah Kola."
During his research in the ancient town of Amud, the historian G.W.B. Huntingford noticed that whenever an old site had the prefix "Aw" in its name (such as the ruins of Awbare and Awbube), it denoted the final resting place of a local saint.
Demographics.
The region around the ancient town is primarily inhabited by the Reer Dudub of the Jibriil Yoonis subclan of the Gadabuursi Dir clan.

Geography.
Topography.
The Vale of Wardour lies east of the town of Shaftesbury and is a relatively small but varied landscape. Named after the village of Wardour, its main river is the Nadder which flows from west to east through the vale. In the west the Nadder is fed by its main tributary, the Sem; in the east the valley ends around Wilton where the Nadder is joined by the Wylye. The largest village in the vale is Tisbury.
Natural region.
The vale is a western tongue of National Character Area 133: Blackmore Vale and Vale of Wardour, designated by Natural England. To the north is number 132, Salisbury Plain and West Wiltshire Downs, and to the south is number 134, Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase. The area extends west almost as far as Barford St Martin, where the Nadder valley narrows.
Geology.
Geologically the Vale of Wardour is complex. The Nadder flows through a clay valley surrounded by hills of Purbeck, Portland, and Lower and Upper Greensand.The Gault, thickness up to 27.5 m (90 ft.), is also present in the Vale, notable are the numerous phosphatic nodules it contains.

Pitt Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania

Pitt Township was one of the original townships created with the formation of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania in 1788. It repeatedly diminished in size until dissolving into the city of Pittsburgh in 1868.
History.
When Allegheny County was created in 1788, its territory extended to the north and west state lines. It was divided into seven townships, of which Pitt Township was by far the largest in area as it included all of the vast part of the county north of the Ohio River and west of the Allegheny River. The rest of Pitt Township lay between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, from their confluence at Pittsburgh (then an unincorporated village within the township) to Turtle Creek on the Monongahela and Plum Creek on the Allegheny.
Pitt Township lost Pittsburgh to the creation of Pittsburgh Township in 1792. In 1795 and 1796, the county reorganized the immense portion of Pitt Township north of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers into new townships. Thereafter, Pitt Township was confined to the wedge between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Its territory was further dismembered by the creation of Wilkins Township (1821), Northern Liberties borough (1829), Peebles Township (1833), the sixth through ninth wards of Pittsburgh (1845–1846), and Oakland Township (1866). The final remnant of Pitt Township, bordering north of Oakland, was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868.
There had been an earlier Pitt Township in southwestern Pennsylvania prior to the creation of Allegheny County. Formed in 1771 as part of Bedford County, it was originally bounded on the north by the Ohio and Allegheny rivers and on the south by a line drawn due west from the mouth of Redstone Creek.

Morbakka virulenta

Morbakka virulenta is a species of box jellyfish that is found in waters near the islands of Japan. The species was originally described in the genus "Tamoya" by Kamakichi Kishinouye in 1910. However, unlike other species of that genus, this jellyfish did not have the vertical gastric phacellae which protect the inside of the bell with nematocyst warts. As a result, it was reclassified to the genus "Morbakka" due to its distinctively shaped rhopaliar horns which resemble rabbit ears. Because of its painful stings, "M. virulenta" has been nicknamed "Hikurage", which is “fire jellyfish” in Japanese.
Description.
In common with other jellyfish in the class Cuboza, "Morbakka virulenta" has a box-like shape. It has rabbit like rhopaliar horns and closely resembles its close relative from Australia, "Morbakka fenneri". "M. virulenta" is one of the largest species of box jellyfish, with tentacle lengths of about three metres at maximum extension. The maximum bell height observed in "M. virulenta" can range up to 250 mm and the bell width can range up to 200 mm. The bell of "M. virulenta" is rectangle-shaped and covered with nematocyst warts. "Morbakka virulenta" can be distinguished from other species in the family by its heavily branched velarial canals as well as two rows of perradial warts with additional scattered warts.
Distribution.
"M. virulenta" have been identified in waters off the coast of Japan in tropical and temperate waters of the neritic zone, notably the Seto Inland Sea. Although the exact habitat distribution is unknown, its range may possibly extend to much of the Indo-Pacific as well as the open ocean. "M. virulenta" has exclusively been recorded during the fall and winter months in the Japanese region.
Ecology.
Reproduction and development.
"M. virulenta" prefer to breed in the morning time during the fall and winter months, the only months in which adult specimens have been observed. The metamorphosis of embryo into primary polyps has been observed to take 21 days, significantly longer than other box jellyfish. Due to the soft bottoms over which "M. virulenta" breed, the polyps have long stalks to compensate for being buried in the soft sediment layer on the seafloor. The metamorphosis from polyp to juvenile medusa takes "M. virulenta" 15 days under the right conditions, and the full maturation of the medusa takes approximately 100 days.
Toxins.
While "M. virulenta" is known by local fishermen and divers as a dangerous species and has been described as having a fiery sting, it has not yet been confirmed if they contain the toxic venom that cause Irukandji syndrome, which can lead to heart failure and death. The venom, which is released through the nematocysts, has been identified in other species in the family Carukiidae.

Moussa Mostafa Moussa

Moussa Mostafa Moussa (; born 13 July 1952) is an Egyptian architect and politician. He became the leader of El-Ghad Party in 2005 and was a candidate in the 2018 Egyptian presidential election.
Early life.
Moussa was born in Giza. He started his studies in Egypt but, on his father's advice, completed them in France, earning a master's degree in Architecture from École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Versailles. He was a member of the youth organisation of the New Wafd Party and then the party itself.
Career.
He joined El-Ghad Party in 2005, becoming vice-chairman. After its leader Ayman Nour was sentenced to five years in jail, El-Ghad split into two factions, led respectively by Moussa and Gameela Ismail. They fought to be recognized as successors and both used the party's name and symbols. The dispute was resolved in May 2011 in favour of Moussa's group. He unsuccessfully ran for the Egyptian House of Representatives where he would have represented the Southern Giza constituency in the 2010 elections. He also led the party during the 2011–12 election.
Moussa was originally a supporter of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, incumbent President of Egypt. He played a role in collecting pledges for Sisi until 20 January 2018, when he announced running for office. He claimed to have support from 26 members of parliament and 47,000 signatures. He submitted all the documents and signatures to the National Election Authority the next day at 1.45 pm, just 15 minutes before the deadline. He claims not to be a phony candidate in spite of supporting Sisi's candidacy. Because other potential candidates either declined to start or were forced out, Moussa was the only candidate running apart from Sisi.
Personal life.
He is married and has one son and two daughters. His brother Ali Moussa was a chief of Egypt's Chamber of Commerce.

Thomas Howe Scanlan

Thomas Howe Scanlan (November 10, 1832 – July 9, 1906) was a mayor of Houston, Texas. He supported the Union during Reconstruction, and was installed as an alderman and mayor during that period. As well as investing in real estate, he owned stakes in local companies, including rail transportation and utilities.
Early life and family.
Thomas Howe Scanlan was born on November 10, 1832 in Castle Mahon, Limerick County, Ireland. He moved to New York at the age of seven.
Scanlan married Harmena Ebert on April 28, 1861. They raised seven daughters who survived into adulthood.
Career.
Scanlan moved to Houston to work as a merchant in 1853.
Scanlan joined the Republican Party at the dawn of Reconstruction, then two years later, accepted a position on Houston City Council representing the Third Ward. The Reconstruction Governor appointed him mayor of Houston in 1870. After collecting opinions among financiers regarding Houston's good credit standing, Scanlan recommended issuing more bonds for capital projects, such as for paving, drainage, and a new city hall complex. He characterized his own approach to public spending as prioritizing function over aesthetics, and evaluated many materials and processes to street improvement. However, his critics noted the extravagant design and cost of the Houston building housing city hall, the market house, and theater.
Scanlan advocated for the purchase of lands for three parks, later indebting the City by constructing a City Hall and Market House in 1872.
Scanlan invested in rail ventures, including the Texas Western Railroad and an early streetcar enterprise, the Bayou City Street Railway Company. His business activities included utility companies, such as the Houston Water Works Company and the Houston Gas Company, where he served as Vice-President. He was Houston Postmaster General from 1875 through 1879.
Death and legacy.
Scanlan died in Chicago on July 9, 1906. He is interred at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.
The Scanlan Building, a NRHP-listed property in Downtown Houston, is located on land he purchased in 1865. His seven surviving daughters hired Daniel Burnham to design the building and named it in their father’s honor. They donated proceeds from the building to charities. One of his surviving daughters, Lillian, established the Scanlan Foundation upon her death in 1947. Catholic institutions were the beneficiaries of the foundation.

Goodbye (The Humans song)

"Goodbye" is a song recorded by Romanian group The Humans, released on 12 January 2018 by Roton. The track was written by vocalist Cristina Caramarcu, while production and composition were handled by fellow members Alexandru Matei and Alin Neagoe. "Goodbye" is a 1980s-inspired soft rock and pop rock ballad whose instrumentation includes a cello; lyrically, it is a manifesto that discourages the abandonment of one's dreams. It also discusses the overcoming of suicidal ideation, depression and internal battles. Reviewers likened the track to the music of Bonnie Tyler, Celine Dion and Heart.
"Goodbye" represented Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal after winning the pre-selection show "Selecția Națională". The country failed to qualify for the Grand Final for the first time in their participation history. During their highly acclaimed show, The Humans performed choreography in front of several white and black, masked mannequins, representing depersonalization and the loss of identity in modern times. Music critics gave the song itself generally negative reviews, criticizing the recording as underwhelming; some expressed doubt that Romania would qualify.
To promote "Goodbye", the band performed the song on multiple occasions, including at the ITB Berlin in Germany, as well as in Israel, Spain and Portugal. An accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Icuagu and was uploaded onto Roton's official YouTube channel simultaneously with the single's release. It portrays The Humans in black outfits and features the use of white masks to allude to the equality of people.
Background and composition.
The Humans is a Romanian band consisting of vocalist Cristina Caramarcu, guitarist Alexandru Cismaru, keyboardist Alexandru Matei, bassist Alin Neagoe and drummer Adi Tetrade. They are joined by cellist Corina Matei. Written by Caramarcu and produced and composed by Matei and Neagoe, their "Goodbye" is a 1980s-inspired soft rock and pop rock ballad whose instrumentation includes a cello. It runs at a length of three minutes. Fabien Randanne of "20 minutes" noted its "vintage" nature, while likening it to the works of Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler. "De Telegraaf" Richard van de Crommert called it "Celine Dion meets Bonnie Tyler and a touch of Heart". The song's melody was composed in 2011 or 2012 by Neagoe, with the track being fully produced and recorded in 2017. All used instruments were recorded live separately.
Regarding the recording's lyrical message, Caramarcu said: "'Goodbye' is a manifesto [...] and an urge to motivate one another not to give up our dreams," adding: "Say 'goodbye' to all the emotions that keep us on the spot, say 'goodbye' to limitations, conventions and step confident towards the future". During an interview with Wiwibloggs, the band stated that the song also discusses suicidal ideation and overcoming it. Benny Royston of "Metro" noticed "dark undertones of internal battles and breaking away from pain of depression". He compared the message to France, Italy and Israel's "theme[s] of public consciousness" captured in their entries for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. "Goodbye" was made available for digital download on 12 January 2018 by Roton. A remix created by disc jockey Cristian Eberhard was also released in March 2018.
Critical reception.
Music critics gave generally negative reviews of "Goodbye" following its release. Irving Wolther of Eurovision.de found the song to be unspectacular and predicted Romania would not qualify for the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. Similar negative response was captured in the comments on the contest's social media after an announcement regarding The Humans' participation. In a Wiwibloggs review containing several reviews from individual critics, Caramarcu's vocal delivery and stage presence was praised, although it was noted that song lacked energy and was "flat", "cheesy" and "retro". Overall, the reviewers on the website gave the song 5.83 out of 10 points. In a later review from Wiwibloggs that included a higher number of reviewers, the song was given a score of 4.94 out of 10 points. In a poll conducted by Romanian news agency DC News, more than 65% of voters said that The Humans did not deserve to win the national selection. Lead singer Caramarcu stated during interviews that the amount of criticism received from the audience was minor. She further elaborated:
"With regard to [the negative feedback captured in] foreign press and all sorts of articles and polls made by Eurovision-specialized sites, I know it is not a hate to us. Each of us has the right to like or not like something. [For example, in a] more negative article from one of the most-watched Eurovision blogs, [the author] basically did not appreciate our song. I met the person who wrote the article in Israel and he was very sincere: 'It is not the music I am listening to and it is not what we like. You are very fine and we love you.' Thus, I was able to understand, and I can still understand, that you cannot please everyone. You cannot be angry at someone just because they say their point of view."
Promotion.
An accompanying music video for "Goodbye" was uploaded simultaneously with the single's release on 12 January 2018 onto Roton's official YouTube channel. Directed by Anthony Icuagu, it features The Humans performing the song wearing black outfits. In interspersed shots, several people wear white masks, which the band said signifies that "in essence we are all the same, we are equal in the right to dream and aspire to the highest goals". For further promotion, The Humans appeared on various Romanian talk shows before and after their "Selecția Națională" win and commenced a tour in Europe. One destination was the ITB Berlin in Berlin, Germany, where promotional CDs of the song were handed. The band also had endeavours in Israel, Spain and Portugal. Regarding their tour, Caramarcu said in an interview with "Adevărul":
"I was amazed [by the fact] that there are Eurovision fans who are very well-prepared and know about each of us. They are documented, look for pictures with us to give them autographs, sing our song and want to take pictures with us everywhere. This phenomenon is [great]. There is no trace of hate and negative energy [from] Eurovision fans and those who participate in the promotional endeavours."
At Eurovision.
National selection.
The Romanian Television (TVR) opened a submission period for artists and composers to submit their entries between 15 November and 15 December 2017 to the "Selecția Națională", during which 72 entries were received. All entrants got to participate in auditions on 19 and 20 December — which were broadcast in January 2018 on TVR1 — in front of a jury made up of five music industry professionals. 60 songs qualified for the five semi-finals — 12 for each semi-final — which took place throughout January and February 2018. The top three acts selected by the jury from each semi-final qualified for the final held on 25 February 2018, which encompassed 15 finalists. The winner was then determined by televoting. The Humans auditioned their song during the live audition round of the "Selecția Națională", qualifying for the fifth and last semi-final on 18 February 2018. In the semi-final, they performed tenth and placed first with 58 points (with four jurors awarding them the maximum of 12 points), qualifying for the final. The group performed last in the final round on 25 February 2018; lead singer Caramarcu wore a red dress hand-sewed by Romanian designer Andreea Zamfir. The Humans ultimately won the "Selecția Națională", gathering 3,277 audience votes.
In Lisbon.
The Eurovision Song Contest 2018 took place at the Altice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal and consisted of two semi-finals on 8 and 10 May, and the final on 12 May 2018. According to Eurovision rules, each country, except the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), is required to qualify from one of two semi-finals to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. On 3 April 2018, it was announced that "Goodbye" would be performed second in the second semi-final of the contest, following Norway and preceding Serbia. Romania failed to qualify for the Grand Final for the first time in their participation history, making it one of their worst results ever.
Live performance and reception.
The Humans' Eurovision performance was directed by Petre Năstase, while Gabriel Scîrlet was hired as the music director. The outfits used were designed by Alexandra Calafeteanu. Năstase elaborated: "[The song will be accompanied by] elements that will give a certain depth to the show, as there is no background graphics on the stage in Lisbon. Everything is based on a play on lights, in a concept that will humanize our message." The Humans' rehearsals in Lisbon were scheduled to take place on 1 May and 4 May 2018; the group had previously prepared for the contest at Studiourile TVR in Bucharest, Romania.
The performance begins with cellist Matei removing a mask from her face; she wears a white dress and subsequently walks to the other end of the stage. Following this, Caramarcu is presented wearing a draping purple gown with a deep thigh-split on her left leg. Two band members perform choreography around her, both wearing white clothing along with masks on the back of their heads. Later in the show, Caramarcu wildly shakes her head and swishes her hair "all over the place" during the song's first refrain. After the singer walks on the stage — which is filled with a total of 25 masked male and female, black and white mannequins — she and the aforementioned members reach one of its ends to perform hand choreography in front of Matei. After playing the second refrain, The Humans' performance ends with Caramarcu standing in the middle of four bandmates. According to William Lee Adams of Wiwibloggs, the performance "remind[s] us of our humanity amid those who have no feelings. At times [Caramarcu's] band mates ... freeze and become 'mannequins' themselves, adding to the message that anyone can become frozen or indeed come back to life." The Humans further elaborated: "Our show includes masked mannequins, which reference depersonalization and the risk of losing identity in an increasingly fast and indifferent world that we are witnessing in everyday life. The concept emphasizes the song's message, which is hope and encouragement. We want to emphasize how important it is to stop, look around and enjoy life."
The Humans' performance was met with mostly positive reviews from music critics and viewers. An editor of EuroVisionary praised it, stating that the group "takes new technology to a whole new level not used before at Eurovision", while also applauding Caramarcu's vocal delivery and the band's overall stage presence. Jessica Weaver from ESC Today also praised the singer's vocals and wrote: "The Humans have produced a rather theatrical performance [...], with plenty of interpretive dance included throughout the entire song. Perhaps a performance which wasn’t expected from Romania for this entry". Weaver further commented that The Humans' show "is set to make a statement" and predicted it would "catch the viewers' eyes due to its differing style". Lee Adams, writing for Wiwibloggs, applauded the performance's creative and artistic nature, and stated that it "cuts across borders and touches hearts". He further noted the stage's dark lighting which "[take the viewer] to another world — a museum perhaps — and the visuals were so striking you didn't want to leave". In a more mixed review, an editor of Eurovision.de called the performance "rather disturbing", while likening the mannequins to those featured in the American science fiction action film "I, Robot" (2004). "De Telegraaf" van de Crommert compared The Humans' show to a stadium concert, and the mannequins to "porn dolls with latex suits".
Points awarded to Romania.
Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Romania in the contest's second semi-final, as well as the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the show. Romania placed 11th with a total of 107 points, four behind tenth-placed and Grand Final-qualified Hungary. Romania received 40 televoting points, which consisted of 12 awarded by Italy and Moldova, and eight by France and Georgia. The jury points added to 67, including 12 from Hungary and Moldova, as well as eight from Montenegro.

Feuilletine

Feuilletine, or pailleté feuilletine (), is a crispy confection made from thin, sweetened crêpes. The crêpe batter is baked for a few minutes, and the crêpes are allowed to cool; as they cool, they become crisp. In French, these crispy crêpes are called "crêpes gavottes" or "crêpes dentelles"; but when crumbled into small shards, they become "feuilletine".
Feuilletine is decorative and has a buttery flavour, but it is especially valued for the unique texture it adds to dishes. It is sometimes incorporated into praline, hazelnut paste, and other nut pastes. Although feuilletine is produced commercially, it was originally conceived as a way for a pâtisserie to make use of cookie scraps.

Adoption and Children Act 2002

The Adoption and Children Act 2002 is a law that allows unmarried people and same-sex couples in England and Wales to adopt children. The reforms introduced in the Act were based on a comprehensive review of adoption and were described by "The Guardian" as "the most radical overhaul of adoption legislation for almost 30 years".
The Act also allows for the introduction of special guardianship, a legal status that allows for a child to be cared for by a person with rights similar to a traditional legal guardian, but without a requirement for absolute legal separation from the child's birth parents. Special guardianship provisions were passed into law by statutory instrument in 2005 and came into force in 2006.
The Act also introduced a procedure to allow people to trace relatives given up for adoption through an intermediary if both persons are over 18.
An equivalent Act was passed in Scotland in 2007.

Spéculateur

Spéculateur was a lugger from Saint-Malo, commissioned in 1806. She made six cruises against British merchant shipping until the British Royal Navy captured her in 1813.
Career.
For her first cruise "Spéculateur" was under the command of Captain Joseph Pardère-Niquet, who commanded her between 1806 and 1 February 1807, when he took her out of commission. Under his command she captured three prizes: "Elisabeth", "Ariel", and "Falmouth". 
"Lloyd's List" reported that the lugger privateer "Speculaton" had taken "Alert", Foresban, master, as "Alert" was sailing from Mogador to London. The privateer "Active", of Guernsey, had recaptured "Alert", which then sailed to Baltimore, Ireland.
Between 1808 and 1809, "Spéculateur" was under the command of Captain Jean Gaillebeau. On her second cruise she captured "Todos los y animals".
For her third cruise she was under the command of Captain Alexandre-William Black, with 64 men and 6 guns. This took place after her commissioning in October 1809 and ended in April 1810.
Captain Pierre-Claude Martin sailed "Spéculateur" on her fourth cruise from September 1810 to February 1811. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 63 men. She captured several prizes: "Deux amis", "Grinder", "Falmouth", "Belle Cancella", and "Leander".
On 1 November 1810 "Spéculateur" encountered "Leander". An engagement of about a half-hour followed during which men from "Spéculateur" boarded "Leander". On "Leander", Captain Main, two mates, and a seaman were killed, and six men were wounded. On "Spéculateur" of her crew of 55 men, one was killed and two wounded. "Leander" was reportedly taken into Figuerra. A report a week later stated that "Leander" had been lost on her way into Tréguier, Côtes du Nord. A third report about a month later confirmed that it was "Leander" that had been captured and lost near Lorient.
"Spéculateur"s fifth cruise lasted from November 1811 to April 1812. She was armed with six guns and had a crew of 69 men under the command of Captain Pierre Cormier. He captured three prizes: "Falmouth", "Sidbourg", and "Sedbury".
Fate.
Capture cut "Spéculateur"s sixth cruise short. On 22 November 1813 captured the French 14-gun privateer lugger "Spéculation" in the Channel. She was 5 days out of St Malo but had taken nothing. "Spéculateur" had a crew of 72 to 80 men (including 42 Portuguese), under the command of Captain Guillaume-Marie Angenard. Before she struck Angenard was gravely wounded but survived his injuries.

Night-cellar

A night-cellar is a cellar which is open for business at night, typically providing food, drink and entertainment. There were many such in London in the 18th century and they were often disreputable.
George Augustus Sala's account.
George Augustus Sala wrote an account of Evans's Supper Rooms in 1852. This was a famous supper club which would serve hearty food and raucous entertainment in the middle of the night – as late as one in the morning. But he lamented that the night-cellars of the previous century had mostly disappeared in London:
In the 1840s, there was a popular night-cellar in New York called Butter-cake Dick's. This was a favourite of the b'hoys and g'hals – the rough young folk of lower Manhattan. Later in the US, cellar bars and clubs became known as dives because one could dive into them without being seen.

Microtis globula

Microtis globula, commonly known as the globular mignonette orchid or globular onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west coastal region of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to thirty five small greenish-yellow, almost globe-shaped flowers. It often grows in large colonies but only flowers after hot fires the previous summer.
Description.
"Microtis globula" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between eight and thirty five greenish-yellow flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are almost globe-shaped, about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to almost round, about long and wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are triangular, about long, wide and curved with their upper edge partly overlapping the dorsal sepal. The petals are egg-shaped, about long, wide and are surrounded by the sepals. The labellum is long, about wide and lacks an obvious callus. Flowering occurs from December to January but only after a hot or late fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis globula" was first formally described in 1984 by Robert John Bates from a specimen collected near Walpole and the description was published in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens". The specific epithet ("globula") is from the Latin word "globulus" meaning "a little ball" or "globule", referring to the shape of the flowers.
Distribution and habitat.
The globular mignonette orchid grows in peaty, winter-wet areas between Albany and Northcliffe in the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Microtis globula" is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. It is also classified as "vulnerable" under the Commonwealth Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" (EPBC) Act. The main threat to the species is inappropriate fire regimes.

Volumetric video

Volumetric video is a technique that captures a three-dimensional space, such as a location or performance. This type of volumography acquires data that can be viewed on flat screens as well as using 3D displays and VR goggles. Consumer-facing formats are numerous and the required motion capture techniques lean on computer graphics, photogrammetry, and other computation-based methods. The viewer generally experiences the result in a real-time engine and has direct input in exploring the generated volume.
History.
Recording talent without the limitation of a flat screen has been depicted in science-fiction for a long time. Holograms and 3D real-world visuals have featured prominently in Star Wars, Blade Runner, and many other science-fiction productions over the years. Through the growing advancements in the fields of computer graphics, optics, and data processing, this fiction has slowly evolved into a reality. Volumetric video is the logical next step after stereoscopic movies and 360° videos in that it combines the visual quality of photography with the immersion and interactivity of spatialized content and could prove to be the most important development in the recording of human performance since the creation of contemporary cinema. The first volumetric video market report came out in May 2018 and the first online publication dedicated to volumetric video was released in November 2019 - "Volumetric Video News".
Computer graphics and VFX.
Creating 3D models from video, photography, and other ways of measuring the world has always been an important topic in computer graphics. The ultimate goal is to imitate reality in minute detail while giving creatives the power to build worlds atop this foundation to match their vision. Traditionally, artists create these worlds using modeling and rendering techniques developed over decades since the birth of computer graphics. Visual effects in movies and video games paved the way for advances in photogrammetry, scanning devices, and the computational backend to handle the data received from these new intensive methods. Generally, these advances have come as a result of creating more advanced visuals for entertainment and media, but have not been the goal of the field itself.
LIDAR.
LIDAR scanning describes a survey method that uses laser-sampled points densely packed to scan static objects into a point cloud. This requires physical scanners and produces enormous amounts of data. In 2007 the band Radiohead used it extensively to create a music video for "House of Cards", capturing point cloud performances of the singer's face and of select environments in one of the first uses of this technology for volumetric capture. Director James Frost collaborated with media artist Aaron Koblin to capture 3D point-clouds used for this music clip, and while the final output of this work was still a rendered flat representation of the data, the capture and mindset of the authors was already ahead of its time. Point clouds, being distinct samples of three-dimensional space with position and color, create a high fidelity representation of the real world with a huge amount of data. However, viewing this data in real-time was not yet possible.
Structured light.
In 2010 Microsoft brought the Kinect to the market, a consumer product that used structured light in the infrared spectrum to generate a 3D mesh from its camera. While the intent was to facilitate and innovate in user input and gameplay, it was very quickly adapted as a generic capture device for 3D data in the volumetric capture community. By projecting a known pattern onto the space and capturing the distortion by objects in the scene, the result capture can then be computed into different outputs. Artists and hobbyists started to make tools and projects around the affordable device, sparking a growing interest in volumetric capture as a creative medium.
Researchers at Microsoft then constructed an entire capture stage using multiple cameras, Kinect devices, and algorithms that generated a full volumetric capture from the combined optical and depth information. This is now the Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture Studio, used today as part of both their research division and in certain select commercial experiences such as the Blade Runner 2049 VR experience. There are currently three studios in operation: Redmond, Washington; San Francisco, CA and London, England. While this remains a very interesting setup for the high-end market, the affordable price of a single Kinect device led more experimental artists and independent directors to become active in the volumetric capture field. Two results from this activity are Depthkit and EF EVE ™. EF EVE ™ supports one or two sensors on one PC giving full volumetric capture with easy setup. It also has automatic sensors calibration and VFX functionality. Depthkit is a software suites that allows the capture of geometry data with one structured light sensor including the Azure Kinect, as well as high quality color detail from an attached witness camera.
Photogrammetry.
Photogrammetry describes the process of measuring data based on photographic reference. While being as old as photography itself, only through advances over the years in volumetric capture research has it now become possible to capture more and more geometry and texture detail from a large number of input images. The result is usually split into two composited sources, static geometry and full performance capture. For static geometry, sets that are captured with a large number of overlapping digital images are then aligned to each other using similar features in the images and used as a base for triangulation and depth estimation. This information is interpreted as 3D geometry, resulting in a near-perfect replica of the set. Full performance capture, however, uses an array of video cameras to capture real-time information. Those synchronized cameras are then used frame-by-frame to generate a set of points or geometry that can be played back at speed, resulting in the full volumetric performance capture that can be composited into any environment. In 2008, 4DViews installed a first volumetric video capture system at DigiCast studio in Tokyo (JP). Later in 2015, 8i contributed in the field, and recently Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung have joined in by creating their own capture stages for performance capture and photogrammetry.
Virtual reality.
As volumetric video developed into a commercially applicable approach to environment and performance capture, the ability to move about the results with six degrees of freedom and true stereoscopy necessitated a new type of display device. With the rise of consumer-facing VR in 2016 through devices such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, this was suddenly possible. Stereoscopic viewing and the ability to rotate and move the head as well as move in a small space allows immersion into environments well beyond what was possible in the past. The photographic nature of the captures combined with this immersion and the resulting interactivity is one giant step closer to being the holy grail of true virtual reality. With the rise of 360° video content, the demand for 6-DOF capture is rising, and VR in particular drives the applications for this technology, slowly fusing cinema, games and art with the field of volumetric capture research.
Light fields.
Light fields describe at a given sample point the incoming light from all directions. This is then used in post processing to generate effects such as depth of field as well as allowing the user to move their head slightly. Since 2006 Lytro is creating consumer-facing cameras to allow the capture of light fields. Fields can be captured inside-out in camera or outside-in from renderings of 3D geometry, representing a huge amount of information ready to be manipulated. Currently data rates are still a large issue and the technique has a large potential for the future as it samples light and displays the result in a variety of ways.
Another by-product of this technique is a reasonably accurate depth map of the scene. Meaning each pixel has information about its distance from the camera. Facebook is using this idea in its Surround360 camera family to capture 360° video footage that is getting stitched with the help of distance maps. Extracting this raw data is possible and allows a high-resolution capture of any stage. Again the data rates combined with the fidelity of the depth maps are huge bottlenecks but soon to be overcome with more advanced depth estimation techniques, compression, as well as parametric light fields.
Workflows.
Different workflows to generate volumetric video are currently available. These are not mutually exclusive and are used effectively in combinations. Here are some examples that show a couple of them:
Mesh-based.
This approach generates a more traditional 3D triangle mesh similar to the geometry used for computer games and visual effects. The data volume is usually less but the quantization of real-world data into lower resolution data limits the resolution and visual fidelity. Trade-offs are generally made between mesh density and final experience performance.
Photogrammetry is usually used as a base for static meshes, and is then augmented with performance capture of talent via the same underlying technology of videogrammetry. Intense clean up is required to create the final set of triangles. To extend beyond the physical world, CG techniques can be deployed to further enhance the captured data, employing artists to build onto and into the static mesh as necessary. The playback is usually handled by a real-time engine and resembles a traditional game pipeline in implementation, allowing interactive lighting changes and creative and archivable ways of compositing static and animated meshes together.
Point-based.
Recently the spotlight has shifted towards point-based volumetric capture. The resulting data is represented as points or particles in 3D space carrying attributes such as color and point size with them. This allows for more information density and higher resolution content. The data rates required are big and current graphics hardware is not optimized to render this, being optimised to a mesh-based render pipeline.
The main advantage of points is the potential for higher spatial resolution. Points can either be scattered on triangle meshes with pre-computed lighting, or used directly from a LIDAR scanner. Performance of talent is captured the same way as per the mesh-based approach, but more time and computational power can be used at production time to further improve the data. At playback, 'level of detail' can be utilized to manage the computational load on the playback device, increasing or decreasing the number of polygons. Interactive light changes are harder to realize as the bulk of the data is pre-baked. This means that while the lighting information stored with the points is very accurate and high-fidelity, it lacks the ability to easily change in any given situation. Another benefit of point capture is that computer graphics can be rendered with very high quality and also stored as points, opening the door for a perfect blend of real and imagined elements.
After capturing and generating the data, editing and compositing is done within a realtime engine, connecting recorded actions to tell the intended story. The final product can then be viewed either as a flat rendering of the captured data, or interactively in a VR headset.
While one goal, with the point-based approach to volumetric capture, is to stream point data from cloud to the user at home, allowing the creating and dissemination of realistic virtual worlds on demand - a second goal more recently considered would be a real-time data stream of live events. This requires very high bandwidth as pixel information includes depth data (i.e. become voxels)
Promises.
With the general understanding of the technology in mind, this chapter will describe the advances on the horizon for entertainment and other industries, as well as the potential this technology has to change media landscape.
True immersion.
As volumetric video evolves into global capture and the display hardware evolves to match, we will enter into an era of true immersion where the nuances of captured environment combined with those of captured performances will convey emotionality in a whole new medium, blurring the boundaries between real and virtual worlds. This groundbreaking in the world of sensory trickery will spark an evolution in the way we consume media, and while technologies for other senses like scent, smell, and proprioception are still in research and development stage, one day in the not-so-distant future we will travel convincingly to new locales, both real and imagined. Industries in tourism and journalism will find new life in the ability to transport to a viewer or visitor safely to a location, while others such as architectural visualization and civil engineering will find ways to build entire structures and cities and explore them without the need for a single swing of a hammer.
Full capture and re-use.
Once a capture is created and saved, it can be re-used and even possibly re-purposed ad nauseam for circumstances beyond the initial envisioned scope. Creating a virtual set enables volumetric videographers and cinematographers to create stories and plan for shots without needing a crew or to even be present at the physical set itself, and a proper visualization can help an actor or performer block out a scene or action with the comfort that their practice isn't at the expense of the rest of production. Old sets can be captured digitally before being torn down, allowing them to persist eternally as a place to revisit and explore for entertainment and inspiration, and multiple sets can be kit-bashed in such a way to tighten the iteration loops of set design, sound design, coloring, and many other aspects of production.
Traditional skillsets.
One area of concern with the growing field of volumetric capture is the shrinking of demand for traditional skillsets like modeling, lighting, animation, etc. However, while in future the stack of production-oriented volumetric capture technologies will grow and grow, so too will the demand for traditional skillsets.
Volumetric capture excels at capturing static data or pre-rendered animated footage. It can not, however, create an imaginary environment or natively allow for any level of interactivity. This is where skilled artists and developers will be in highest demand, creating seamless interactive events and assets to complement the existing geometry data, or using the existing data as a base on which to build, similar to how a digital painter might paint over a basic 3D render. The onus will be on the artisan to ensure they keep up with the tools and workflows that best suit their skillsets, but the prudent will find that the production pipeline of the future will involve many opportunities to streamline the creation of the labor-intensive and allowing for investment in bigger creative challenges.
Most importantly, skills currently rendered semi-obsolete by advances in computer graphics and off-line rendering will once again be made relevant, as the fidelity of things like real, hand-built sets quality tailored costumes rendered as high volume captures will almost always be far more immersive than anything completely CG. By combining these real-life set capture with the volumetric captures of additional CG elements, we will be able to blend real-life and our imagination in a way that we have only previously been able to do on a flat-screen, creating new fields in the areas like compositing and VFX.
Challenges.
The capture and creation process of volumetric data is full of challenges and unsolved problems. It is the next step in cinematography and comes with issues that will removed over time.
Visual language.
As every medium creates its own visual language, rules and creative approaches, volumetric video is still at the infancy of this. This compares to the addition of sound to moving pictures. New design philosophies had to be created and tested. Currently the language of film, the art of directing is battle hardened over 100 years. In a completely six degrees of freedom, interactive and non-linear world many of the traditional approaches can't function. The more experiences are being created and analyzed, the quicker can the community come to a conclusion about this language of experiences.
Pipeline disruption.
Current video and film making pipelines and productions are not ready to just go volumetric. Every step in the film making process needs to be rethought and reinvented. On set capture, directing of talent on set, editing, photography, story telling, and much more are all fields that need to spend time to adapt to the volumetric workflows. Currently each production is using a variety of technologies as well as trying the rules of engagement.
Data rates.
In order to store and playback the captured data, enormous sets need to be streamed to the consumer. Currently the most effective way is to build bespoke apps that are delivered. There is no standard yet that generated volumetric video and makes it experienceable at home. Compression of this data is starting to be available with the Moving Picture Experts Group in search for a reasonable way to stream the data. This would make truly interactive immersive projects available to be distributed and worked on more efficiently and needs to be solved before the medium becomes mainstream.
Future applications.
Besides the application in entertainment, several other industries have vested interest in the capture of scenes to the detail described above. Sports events would benefit greatly from a detailed replay of the state of a game. This is already happening in American football and baseball, as well as British soccer. Those 360° degree replays will enable viewers in the future to analyze a match from multiple perspectives.
Documenting spaces for historical event, captured live or recreated will benefit the educational sector greatly. Virtual lectures depicting big events in history with an immersive component will help future generations imagine spaces and learn collaboratively about events. This can be abstracted and used to visualize micro scale scenarios on a cellular level as much as epic events that changed the course of the human experiment. The main advantage being that virtual field trips is the democratisation of high end educational scenarios. Being able to take part in visiting a museum without having to physically be there allows a broader audience and also enables institutions to show their entire inventory rather the subsection currently on display.
Real estate and tourism could preview destinations accurately and make the retail industry much more custom for the individual. Capturing products has already been done for shoes and magic mirrors can be used in stores to visualize this. Shopping Malls have started to embrace this to repopulate them by attracting customers with VR Arcades as well as presenting merchandise virtually.

Helium Privatization Act of 1996

The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 is a United States statute that ordered the US government to sell much of the National Helium Reserve. The United States 104th Congressional session passed the Act of Congress presenting the legislation to the United States President on September 30, 1996. President Bill Clinton enacted the federal statute into law on October 9, 1996.
The law was described by critics as a "fiasco" due to the formula-based sale price being significantly lower than the market price for helium. The bill was amended in 2013 to use an auction to sell helium.

Controversy.
In 2019, McKinsey &amp; Company received criticism for its role as consultant to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In a 2019 email to the firm, Sneader indicated that McKinsey had never focused on developing, advising or implementing immigration policies. McKinsey, he wrote, “will not, under any circumstances, engage in work, anywhere in the world, that advances or assists policies that are at odds with our values.” A subsequent "New York Times" investigation claimed that McKinsey's involvement in deportations had been more extensive than Sneader acknowledged in his email.

United States Coast Guard Cutters

The United States Coast Guard Cutters were a senior amateur ice hockey team operated by the United States Coast Guard Yard on Curtis Bay, Baltimore. The team played in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League for parts of two seasons, using Carlin's Iceland for home games. The Cutters were a separate team from the established Coast Guard Bears of the United States Coast Guard Academy.
History.
The team was founded in 1942 by personnel officer Lieutenant Commander C.R. MacLean, of the Coast Guard in Curtis Bay, and replaced the void in the EAHL when the Baltimore Orioles folded. The Cutters were coached by Mel Harwood, a former goaltender for the Orioles, and a former NHL referee known for officiating game four of the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. Players were required to complete daytime military duties, in addition to playing on the team. The team was accompanied by their own version of the United States Coast Guard Band, that played the “Semper Paratus march," whenever the Cutters scored a goal. 
In the 1942–43 season, Joe Kucler led the league in goals (40), assists (41), and points (81). The Cutters played the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings in an exhibition game on January 6, 1943 in Baltimore, losing 8–3. The Cutters finished first place in the EAHL, winning the Walker Cup. In addition to the EAHL title, the Cutters won two championships of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States, in 1943 and 1944. Eleven games into the second season, the Cutters withdrew from league play on November 28, 1943, but still played exhibition games. The Cutters team disbanded early in 1944, when the World War II effort needed reinforcements.
Players.
The Cutters team featured eight National Hockey League players. Three Cutters players were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including Frank Brimsek, Art Coulter, and John Mariucci. Five Cutters players were inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, including Frank Brimsek, Bob Dill, John Mariucci, Hub Nelson, and Eddie Olson.

Chigoubiche River

The Chigoubiche River is a tributary of the Ashuapmushuan River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec and then into the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The Chigoubiche River flows in the townships of Argenson, Ailleboust and Chomedey. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The route 167 which connects Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the north-east side of Chigoubiche Lake and crosses the Chigoubiche River. The upper part of the river is served by the forest road R0212, R0203 and R0204.
The surface of the Chigoubiche River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
During the period between 1950 (about) and 1964, the Chigoubiche River was named "Argenson River". This toponymic designation was related to the name of the canton of Argenson where it originates in Lake Chigoubiche. The term "Argenson" evoked the memory of the fifth governor of New France (1658-1661).
The toponym "Chigoubiche River" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Cyathodes straminea

Cyathodes straminea, also known as false-whorled cheeseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae endemic to Tasmania, where it grows as an alpine to subalpine shrub (15–60 cm in height) with a spreading habit. The generic name "Cyathodes" was derived from Greek "Cyath" = cup and "odes" = like, referring to the ovary encircled by cup-shaped nectary.
Description.
"Cyathodes straminea" is a shrub with leaves arranged in pseudowhorls. Leaves are obovate-elliptic 7–16 mm long, 3-4.5 mm wide, often with a membranous margin, and a soft, blunt point. The upper surface is glabrous, but the lower surface is covered in white wax (glaucous) with prominent parallel veins (Fig.1). Petiole 1.6-2.4 mm long. The flowers occur in summer in upper leaf axils (Fig.2) and have a strong cheesy smell, are white, bell-shaped and hermaphrodite (both male and female) with long corolla lobes and anthers exserted on thick filaments. They have 5-10 locules in the ovary, developing into red, rounded, flattened fruits to 8mm wide, reputed to be edible (raw or cooked) (Fig.3).
Habitat.
"Cyathodes straminea" grows frequently in open shrubby subalpine heathland and woodlands on the Dolerite mountains of the northern, central and eastern parts of Tasmania above 1000m. Usually found on medium and heavy (clay) soils in moist, rocky and windy sites, with well-drained conditions and is frost tolerant. Commonly associated with "Eucalyptus coccifera", "Orites revoluta", "Helichrysum" and "Richea" species.
Cultivation.
It requires a well-drained moist soil in a sheltered site. These plans are very susceptible to drought but can grow even in -7 °C. The seeds should be surface sown in ericaceous soil. It germinates within 1–2 months at 18 °C. Scarification will reduce the germination time and 2 or 3 periods of 4 – 6 weeks cold stratification, alternated with 4 weeks warm stratification can also help.

12th Infantry Division (France)

12th Infantry Division ("12e division d'infanterie" or "12e DI") was an infantry division of the French Army which took part in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I and World War II. It fought at the Battle of the Nations in 1813. It was converted to a motorised infantry role at Mourmelon-le-Grand in 1939 a few days before the French declaration of war on Germany and renamed 12th Motorised Infantry Division ("12e division d'infanterie motorisée" or "12e DIM")
History.
World War I.
It belonged to 6th Army Corps and had its headquarters at the Reims garrison as of 1 August 1914 and was mobilised in the 6th Region. Between 1 and 14 August it was taken by train to Vigneulles-lès-Hattonchâtel and ordered to defend the region around Heudicourt and Thillot. From 14 August it began to move a position near Fresnes-en-Woëvre, then near Etain. It went on the offensive towards Chiers on 21 August as part of the Battle of the Ardennes and the following day fought its way towards Ugny and Doncourt-lès-Longuyon, followed by fighting on the Crusnes and near the farm at Puiseaux and near Rèvemont on 23rd and near Arrancy on the 24th. On 25 August it withdrew to the west towards the River Meuse and new positions near Damvillers and Consenvoye. From 27 August it defended the river crossings around Gercourt and Brieulles-sur-Meuse and from 2 September resumed its withdrawal, this time south towards Montfaucon, Jubécourt and finally Rembercourt-aux-Pots. There it took part in the First Battle of the Marne from 6 to 20 September, including around Sommaisne and Rembercourt-aux-Pots during the battle of Revigny - one of the German officers attacking it was Erwin Rommel. On 14 September it began to be pursued towards Nixéville and Charny before it was able to hold its position around Ville-devant-Chaumont in bois d'Haumont. On 20 September it was taken out of the front-line and moved to Mouilly and Rupt-en-Woëvre. From 21 September it manned the front in the Braquis region opposite Étain until being urgently ordered to the trenches at Calonne to stop the German offensive. It marched towards Saint-Mihiel and the Hauts de Meuse and on 22 September arrived at Rupt in Woêvre and fought at Mouilly, the Calonne trench, Saint-Remy, positions in Les Éparges and in front of the Calonne trench-line. The front then stabilised and it was placed in a sector around the bois Loclont and Trésauvaux. It made an attack on the Calonne trench on 26 December.
From 17 to 21 February 1915 it was involved in fierce fighting during the battle of Les Éparges, where it was also engaged resumed on 18th, 19 and 27 March. On 18–20 March it carried out a joint attack on Verdun with the Marche Infantry Division, originally planned for 10–11 March. 12th Division was ordered to capture two bastions to its west and east, joined by a trench - the trench and eastern bastion formed two intersecting lines of fire, whilst the western bastion formed three, all reinforced with underground bunkers. The French would attack from part of a spur taken in previous attacks, 50 metres away from the German positions. The explosion of mines made little effect, as did a 45-minute bombardment from 15:15 hours on 18 March. 132nd Line Infantry Regiment led the attack at 16:05, taking spur C fifteen minutes later but the German response meant the attack was bogged down by 17:00. By 19:00 132nd Regiment had reached a mid-point between points O and X and the attack resumed at 4:45 the following morning, but was held off by German machine-gunners at point X. French artillery opened fire on the eastern point of bois des Sapins from point N at 8:30 and the attack resumed again at 9:25, but was again held off. A German counter-attack was unsuccessful at 10:00 and an hour later the line stabilised. A fresh French artillery bombardment led to new attacks at midday and 16:00, but these both proved unsuccessful. The attack resumed again on 20 March at 4:00 and by 10:00 21st Division asked 24th Brigade to organise its positions.
Second World War.
On the declaration of war on 3 September 1939 the division at Thionville in northern France and was placed on the border opposite the German troops advancing towards Kœnigsmacker near the end of the Maginot Line. After a month of fighting it was relieved and went into reserve near Hirson.
On 10 May 1940 the division was attached to 5th Army Corps, which formed part of 1st Army. Most of the division was sent to the Saint-Quentin area on that date, although 3e GRDI were stationed to the south of Maubeuge in accordance with the Dyle Plan, Plan Yellow and the order to occupy the Gembloux sector near Namur. 3e GRDI and the engineers of 2nd Engineer Regiment were soon moved to fight delaying actions in advance of the defensive positions between Rhisnes and Temploux. On the night of 10–11 May reconnaissance parties from these detachments advanced into Belgium and from 18:00 took up positions to the rear of the Cavalry Corps, which was holding the Tirlemont-Huy line. Meanwhile, the other elements of 12th Division set off at 17:00 to avoid the Luftwaffe, which had already gained air superiority.
On the morning of 12 May the first elements of the division arrived and its units deployed immediately into their positions, despite continued air attack in the Dyle region, particularly at Rhisnes and Temploux. Ahead of the positions the engineers prepared a line of twenty demolition charges, but on 13 May air attacks became more targeted and more frequent. Rhisnes and Temploux were attacked again, as was the divisional command post at Spy, Belgium, forcing it to move elsewhere. The infantry dug in and placed a line of anti-tank mines all along its front line, with artillery in camouflaged positions. By evening the division was the only French unit in the area which had arrived and was ready to fight. To the east the Germans had crossed the Albert Canal, refugees were flooding west, several cut-off Belgian units were falling back and 2nd French Cavalry Corps (made up of 2nd and 3rd Light Mechanised Divisions) was preparing to fall back after fighting all day at Hannut and Merdorp against German tanks and Stukas - 3e GRDI took over the liaison between these two light mechanised divisions. To the south the 9th French Army had lost several bridges over the Meuse and would have to counter-attack on 14 May alongside the powerful, armoured, "1re division cuirassée" (1st Division of Cuirassers).
On 14 May Perwez was abandoned by the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais, who fell back behind the positions held by 12th Division. The French cavalry corps under general Prioux also withdrew, using its last tanks to protect 12th Division's engineers, enabling them to blow the demolition charges between Hanret and Saint-Germain and regroup at Onoz. 3e GRDI covered the final part of the cavalry corps' withdrawal and suffered heavy losses. In the afternoon German light tanks attacked 150th Infantry Regiment's positions but rapidly withdrew under fire from 225th Artillery Regiment. At the end of the afternoon 150th Regiment's 1st Battalion and the 3e GRDI were given the order to turn south and hold the crossings of the Sambre Sambre à Floriffoux between Namur and Auvelais.
From dawn on 15 May the Luftwaffe resumed its attack on the crossroads, forests and marshalling points. That morning the 8th Zouave Regiment was attacked by German tanks, who were initially sent into retreat thanks to artillery fire. However, at the end of the morning the division received the order to withdraw towards the French border. To avoid air attack it abandoned its positions at night and the division fortified a line along the Charleroi canal running through Spy, Velaine and Fleurus. At the end of the night 3e GRDI covered the withdrawal of 5e DINA before destroying eleven bridges between Floreffe and Ham-sur-Sambre and rendering one more impassible to road traffic. At dawn on 16 May the division gathered at Orneau, where it received orders to rush to the area between Godarville and Motte-Courcelles on the canal to meet a German push across the Sambre to the south. At midday the division continued to withdraw, but the routes were clogged by refugees and other troops and still under constant air attack. At the end of the day the forward parties had only just reached Gosselies and Jumet. A detachment made up of elements of 106th Line Infantry Regiment and 3e GRDI under colonel Parent fought rearguard actions against advanced German units before retiring under cover of night.
During the night of 16–17 May most of the division's infantry regiments crossed the canal via the bridges at Roux and Courcelles and immediately deployed. The enemy penetrated the front in force across the Luttre bridge, which Belgian engineer units had failed to destroy, attacking and pressing 150th Regiment and 8th Zouaves, who formed the vanguard. 38e Combat Tanks Battalion and a group of reconnaissance squadrons from 3e GRDI under captain de Lannoy were given artillery support and managed to push the enemy back to the east bank of the canal. The front was re-established at 19:00, but a new order to withdraw came in and during the night of 17–18 May 12 Division took up new positions on high ground at Bavai. After German tanks attacked at Ciply on 19 May, the division's infantry was ordered to withdrew to Hainaut. The divisional commander had lost contact with his superior René Altmayer and decided to withdraw again towards Valenciennes by a night march, with 153 DIM taking up the rearguard position. On the evening of 20 May 12e DIM was switched to 3rd Army Corps and on 21 May 12 Division regrouped and headed for Bruay-en-Artois under cover of darkness. 106th Line Infantry Regiment was detached from the division on 22 May and taken north by truck to hold a fortified position between Cysoing and Mouchin, while the rest of 12th Division marched on foot from Bruay-en-Artois to Avelin. Fighting by day and marching by night, they managed to pass through encircling German troops to finally reach Dunkirk. Only 8,000 men of the division remained by this point and they were ordered to hold the French sector of the perimeter for nine days during the Operation Dynamo evacuation, holding off an overwhelmingly larger German force. The division's survivors were captured on the morning of 4 June on the beach at Malo-les-Bains.
Postwar.
In 1960 during the Algerian War the division was part of the Oran Corps Area, responsible for the West Oran Zone, with its headquarters in Tlemcen.

Career.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) service.
The DASD for the Middle East is a member of the Senior Executive Service in the Secretary of Defense's office. Mulroy was responsible for DoD policy and for representing the DoD in the interagency for the countries of Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. As DASD for the Middle East, Mulroy was responsible for implementing the National Defense Strategy of 2018 in that region and the Irregular Warfare Annex (IWA) to that strategy.
At a workshop at RAND Corporation in October 2019, Mulroy officially rolled out the IWA, saying it was a critical component of the 2018 NDS. He noted that irregular warfare (IW) included counter-insurgency (COIN), counter-terrorism (CT), unconventional warfare (UW), foreign internal defense (FID), sabotage and subversion, stabilization (warfare), and information operations (IO). He continued that IW had been perceived as limited to the CT effort used to fight violent extremist organizations but should be applied to all competition areas, including the great powers of China and Russia and the rogue states of North Korea and Iran. Mulroy said that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with "aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW" to be competitive across these priorities.
In late 2020, during the delay in the transition between the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration, the incoming team for the DoD reached out to several former members of then-Secretary James Mattis for assistance. Mulroy was one of the former officials and one of the few that agreed to assist.
CIA service.
Mulroy is a retired Paramilitary Operations Office (PMOO) from the Special Activities Center (formerly named Special Activities Division) of the CIA. PMOOs are a hybrid of a clandestine intelligence officer and a military special operator, belonging to the Special Operations Group (SOG) within SAC. They are recruited primarily from the United States Special Operations Command.
While at the CIA, Mulroy spent most of career in conflict areas. His positions included service as a Chief of a Department in Special Activities Center (SAC), a Chief of Station, a Chief of an Expeditionary Team, a Chief of Base, a Deputy Chief of a Branch in Special Activities Division (SAD) and a PMOO in a Branch in SAD, among others.
His CIA awards include the Intelligence Star, the Intelligence Commendation Medal, the Career Intelligence Medal and the National Intelligence Exceptional Achievement Medal, among others. He is also a recipient of the State Department's Superior Honor Award.
Military service.
Mulroy is a retired U.S. Marine and served as a commissioned officer and an enlisted Marine on active duty and in the reserves. He served as an Armored Crewman (United States military occupation code (MOS) 1811) of a M1 Abrams tank, a Judge Advocate (MOS 4412) and an Infantry Officer (MOS 0302). His military awards include the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, among others.
Advocacy for child soldiers.
"My Star in the Sky".
Mulroy is a co-maker along with U.S. Navy SEAL Eric Oehlerich, of the documentary, "My Star in the Sky", which in the Acholi language is “Lakalatwe.” Foreign Policy reports that the documentary came about after Mulroy and Oehlerich met the Opoka's during Operation Observant Compass (OOC). Mulroy called OOC a “model” for how to address child soldiers using influence operations instead of lethal force and working with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)s who found mothers of child soldiers and had them broadcast messages over the radio to come home. Mulroy said that he hopes that OOC serves as a model for future programs to address child soldiers, as well as other operations, as it showed how the U.S. military could use “soft power, influence operations” and other aspects of so-called “irregular warfare” to fight the problem.
This documentary has been screened at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C. based think tank for international affairs, the Enough Project, a non-profit group to end crimes against humanity, Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, and the Truman National Security Project.
The Grassroots Reconciliation Group.
Mulroy is on the Board of Directors for the Grassroots Reconciliation Group (GRG). GRG was initiated as part of a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded program called the Northern Uganda Peace Initiative (NUPI) to reconcile and rehabilitate former child soldiers of Joseph Kony's LRA.
Comments.
In an interview for the podcast "Frog Logic", a podcast primarily for the special operations community, Mulroy said, "I don’t think anyone became a Marine, or a SEAL, or a [CIA] paramilitary officer with the idea that they were going to fight a child.”
Philosophy.
Mulroy is a proponent of Stoic philosophy. In an essay in Modern Stoicism entitled, “A Case for the Philosopher King,” Mulroy advocated for a return of teaching virtue ethics in school and modeling examples of those that should be emulated like Marcus Aurelius, James Stockdale, John Lewis, among others. He did this after citing the precipitous decline in the confidence Americans have in one another.
In an article for ABC News essay entitled, “Where philosophy intersects with war training: stoic soldiers,” Mulroy and Donald Robertson advocated for using stoicism as a philosophy in the military because of its focus on wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage. He advocated for the U.S. military to incorporate stoicism into its basic training at a conference hosted by the U.S. Army National Guard in January 2021 and in a conference hosted by Modern Stoicism as one of the keynote speakers, along with retired National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Georgetown University Professor Nancy Sherman.

Android Go

Android Go, officially Android (Go Edition), is a stripped-down version of the Android operating system, designed for low-end and ultra-budget smartphones. It is intended for smartphones with 2 GB of RAM or less and was first made available for Android Oreo. This mode has platform optimizations designed to reduce mobile data usage (including enabling Data Saver mode by default), and a special suite of Google Mobile Services designed to be less resource- and bandwidth-intensive. Google Play Services was also modularized to reduce its memory footprint. The Google Play Store will highlight lighter apps suited for these devices.
The operating system's interface differs from that of mainline Android, with the quick-settings panel giving greater prominence to information regarding the battery, mobile-data limit, and available storage; the recent apps menu using a modified layout and being limited to four apps (in order to reduce RAM consumption), and an application programming interface (API) for allowing mobile carriers to implement data-tracking and top-ups within the Android settings menu. Some system services are disabled such as Notification access and Picture-in-picture mode to improve performance. 
Most devices running Android Go use Google's "stock" Android GUI, although there are several manufacturers that still use customized GUI.
Versions.
Android Go was made available to OEMs for Android 8.1, and later, for Android Pie.

150th Infantry Regiment (France)

The 150th Infantry Regiment ("150e régiment d'infanterie" or "150e RI") was an infantry regiment in the French Army. Also known as the "Régiment de Bagatelle", it inherited the traditions of the short-lived 150th Demi-Brigade (1794 to 1796) and 150th Line Infantry Regiment (1813 to 1814). The latter was formed by Napoleon I on 12 January 1813 to fight in Germany, where it was decimated, finally disbanding at Arras on 21 July 1814. The final regiment with the numeral 150 was formed as 150th Infantry Regiment on 25 July 1887. This fought in both World Wars, forming part of 12th Infantry Division in May–June 1940 and holding the French sector of the perimeter around Dunkirk, buying time for the success of Operation Dynamo and only surrendering on the beach at Malo-les-Bains on 4 June.
The regiment was re-formed in the armée d'armistice at Agen on 31 August 1940, but this unit was disbanded on 28 November 1942. The Free French Forces also raised a battalion named 150th Infantry Regiment on 1 September 1944 at Verdun. The regiment was definitely re-formed using marching battalions from the Free French Forces in February 1945 and took part in the liberation of Royan. At the end of 1945 it was in Paris but the following year it was disbanded and another 150th Infantry Battalion formed at Verdun. This was sent to Morocco in 1947 before being disbanded on 1 January 1949. A final motorised infantry regiment was formed with the numeral 150 on 4 January 1963, becoming mechanised infantry twelve years later and finally being disbanded in 1990. The numeral was revived in 1990 for a reserve regiment, but this too was disbanded in 1996, ending the regiment's lineage.

<doc id="56687433" url="?curid=56687433" title="Antoine Marie Cerisier">
Antoine Marie Cerisier

Antoine Marie Cerisier (19 November 1749, in Châtillon-lès-Dombes – 1 July 1828, in Châtillon-lès-Dombes) was a French journalist, politician and historian, who played a role in the Patriot Revolution in the Dutch Republic in 1785–1787, after first having supported the cause of the American Revolution in that country in collaboration with American ambassador John Adams. Later he also played a role in the early years of the French Revolution as a collaborator of Mirabeau. In that capacity he published an extract of the Dutch Leiden Draft, a manifesto that may have influenced the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.
Personal life.
Cerisier was born the son of grocer Jean Baptiste Cerisier and Marie Anne Chanrion. He was baptised together with his twin brother Jean Sébastien as "Marie Antoine" on 21 November, but later reversed the order of his Christian names. His uncle J. Cerisier, who taught Rhetoric at the "Collège des Grassins" in Paris, had him educated in that city. Cerisier married Victoire de Vaulpré with whom he had at least nine children.
Career.
Cerisier came to the Netherlands around 1775, where he became secretary to the French legation to the Dutch Republic at The Hague. He had little to do in that function and as a hobby started studying Dutch history. He wrote a total of ten volumes on that subject, mostly from the perspective of the so-called "States party" (the opponents of the Dutch stadtholders) that were published between 1777 and 1784. The French legation at the time was heavily engaged in attempts to influence Dutch public opinion in favor of France and its American allies in the American Revolutionary War. When the Republic became embroiled in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War as an ally of the French and Americans Cerisier (by then no longer a diplomat) became friendly with the new American ambassador, John Adams (apparently from their correspondence even before Adams came to the Netherlands) and the two engaged in disseminating pamphlets in favor of the American cause.
Cerisier became a journalist who contributed to several periodicals. Together with A. Crajenschot he edited "le Politique hollandais" between 1781 and 1784
Cerisier became around 1780 an editor of the "Gazette de Leyde" a French-language Dutch newspaper, published in Leiden by Jean Luzac at the time. This was a newspaper that had many contributors who favored the side of the anti-Orangist Patriot party, the opponents of stadtholder William V. like Wybo Fijnje and Gerrit Paape. Fijnje was one of the editors of the so-called Leiden Draft, a Patriot manifesto that appeared in 1785, and Cerisier may have had some input in its composition, though it is an exaggeration that he actually wrote the entire document. It is true, however, that he published a French extract of the Leiden Draft in 1788, after he had returned to France when the Patriot Revolution had been suppressed by Anglo-Prussian military intervention in the Fall of 1787, and many Patriots fled to France. This extract was entitled "Extrait du plan général de réforme concerté par les patriotes hollandois" and appeared in the periodical "Analyse des papiers anglais". In this period Cerisier closely collaborated with the trailblazer of the French Revolution, Honoré de Mirabeau, and Jeremy Popkin and others have speculated on the basis of archival research that this co-writer of the " Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen" was influenced by this extract of the Dutch document.
Cersisier was elected a representative for the Third Estate to the Estates General of 1789 for Bourg-en-Bresse, but he did not take his seat. Instead he became an editor for the "Gazette universelle", a royalist newspaper which he founded together with Joseph François Michaud and Pascal Boyer in 1789. This journal was financially very successful, but it was suppressed in 1792 when it published the fact that the Jacobin Jean Louis Carra had formerly been sentenced to the galleys. The periodical was then taken over by the government on 15 August 1792 and renamed "Nouvelles politiques, nationales et étrangères". Cerisier had to flee for his life to the Beaujolais where he was arrested and imprisoned under the Reign of Terror. He was released on 9 January 1794 (so before the fall of Maximilien Robespierre on 9 Thermidor).
Apparently, after this experience he decided to leave journalism and become a farmer. Not without success, because in 1807 (when his daughter Marie Sebastienne married) he appears to have been a successful businessman worth 200,000 francs. He became deputy mayor of the municipality of Lancié in 1800. In 1812 he became mayor, which he remained until after the Hundred Days. He resigned in 1816, but remained a member of the municipal council until 26 March 1827.
He died in his native town Châtillon-lès-Dombes on 1 July 1828.

Nordic Cup (football)

The Nordic Cup (; ) was a cup competition for club teams from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden staged on one occasion, starting in June 1959 and ending on 31 July 1962.
Summary.
In December 1958, the group Stævnet proposed a cup competition for club teams from the Nordic countries at a Scandinavian football conference in Copenhagen, which was decided and 16 teams were invited. The teams responding to the invitation were IFK Norrköping, Djurgården, IFK Göteborg, GAIS, Malmö FF, Hälsingborg, and AIK from Sweden, Viking FK, Skeid, and Fredrikstad from Norway, and Vejle, KB, AB, Frem, and Skovshoved from Denmark, while the Finnish teams only wanted to join as a combination team, which initially was rejected.
Initially the final was scheduled to be played in autumn 1960, but the participating team had problems finding match days and the semi-finals were rescheduled to spring 1961.
The Nordic cup saw low attendances.
On 31 July 1962, the first edition of the cup ended with a final on Stockholm Olympic Stadium between Djurgården of Stockholm and the Helsinki-Alliance, which the Helsinki team won with 1–0 on a penalty in first half, and won the trophy donated by Scandinavian Airlines.

Christine of the Hungry Heart

Christine of the Hungry Heart is a 1924 American silent drama film directed by George Archainbaud and starring Florence Vidor. It was produced by Thomas H. Ince and released through First National Pictures.
Plot.
As described in a review in a film magazine, Christine Madison (Vidor) marries Stuart Knight (Baxter). He is a heavy drinker and prefers the company of his companions to that of his wife’s more polite circle. She realizes a loss of love, and becomes interested in Dr. Monteagle (Brook), an orthopedic specialist. When she realizes his love and her reciprocation, she hurries from him. One her way home there is an automobile crash and her intoxicated husband, joy riding with one of his young charmers, is at the wheel. Monteagle wins her back and marries her. Christine finds devotion to science no more tolerable than the worship of Bacchus. She elopes with Ivan Vianney (Keith), but even before they reach their objective, Rio de Janeiro, she realizes that the man is wrapped up in his work. Monteagle reclaims his little son by cable to the consulate and Christine leaves Ivan, realizing a little too late, that all men make marriage secondary to their love. Eventually, Christine makes atonement through nursing her first husband through his last illness, and Monteagle promises to try and assuage her heart-hunger if she will come back to him and her boy.
Preservation.
A fragment of a print from "Christine of the Hungry Heart" exists in the George Eastman Museum Motion Picture Collection.

Siege of Naples (1528)

The Siege of Naples was a siege of the Italian city of Naples in 1528 during the War of the League of Cognac.
Course.
In April 1528 the French commander Odet de Foix laid siege to the city while Andrea Doria's nephew Filippino organised a naval blockade. The site of the French camp is now occupied by the Cemetery of the 366 Fossae. The hill on which it stood is now known as Poggioreale, but was once called monte di Leutrecco or Lo Trecco, using de Foix's Italian nickname. It was also later mangled into 'Trivice', which was then incorrectly transliterated into Italian as 'Tredici'.
Towards the end of April Naples' governor Hugo of Moncada was killed by two arquebusiers and thrown into the sea during an unsuccessful attempt to break through the naval blockade and reach the Gulf of Salerno. During the battle Alfonso III d'Avalos was captured - he played a decisive part in the later negotiations for Doria's defection. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor appointed Philibert of Chalon Moncada's replacement as governor.
On 22 May Orazio di Giampaolo Baglioni and his Black Bands were ambushed by a squad of Landsknechts near the river Sebeto, with Baglioni killed by a pike thrust. On 4 July Doria lifted the naval blockade after Genoa switched allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire in exchange for the liberation and subjugation of Savoy. In summer 1528, de Foix destroyed the Bolla Aqueduct to try to starve out Naples' garrison. However, this turned the surrounding areas into marshes which combined with the summer heat to cause a fatal epidemic among the French forces. Many died, including de Foix himself on 15 August, passing command of the French force to Louis, Count of Vaudémont, who also died of illness a few days later, passing the command this time to marquis Michele Antonio di Saluzzo.
The French gave up the siege at the end of August and tried to withdraw to Aversa, but were intercepted by an Imperial force, which captured Charles of Navarre and the famous military engineer Pietro Navarro. Navarro was imprisoned in Castel Nuovo, where he was strangled or hanged later that month.

Plains Producer

The Plains Producer is a weekly newspaper published Wednesdays by Papers and Publications Pty. Ltd. in Balaklava, South Australia. It was founded in 1903 and was printed until 1941, when it was stopped by the second world war. The publication was revived in 1946 and it has been published continuously since then.
History.
The newspaper, founded by James Walker, was first known as Central Advocate, which started on 25 September 1903 and continued until 10 September 1909 (Issue 305). when it was renamed Wooroora Producer (subtitled: "incorporating the Central Advocate and The Hamley Bridge Express"), to reflect its link to the former Electoral district of Wooroora (1875-1938). It was purchased in 1910 by W. Hancock who went into partnership with S.W. Osborne (who became sole proprietor in 1923), then by Amy Henstridge in July 1926 (who had previously owned the Snowtown paper "The Stanley Herald"). In 1926, the newspaper shifted from a broadsheet to a tabloid format and from September 1932, the Henstridge family assumed ownership.
The "Wooroora Producer" was printed until 27 June 1940 (Issue 1676), when the publication was renamed on 4 July to The Producer (subtitled: ""with which is incorporated "The Central Advocate" and "Hamley Bridge Express""). However, due to wartime restrictions and rationing, publication ceased for five years, from 19 June 1941 (Issue 1726) until resuming as a "Post-War Series"" on 4 July 1946 (Vol. 40. No. 1). In 1975, it moved from private ownership when it was bought by Papers and Publications, and in an effort to overhaul the newspaper, it was renamed to "Plains Producer" in 1983.
Distribution.
According to the website, "the media workshop (TMW)", the newspaper currently "enjoys a 90% penetration rate in Balaklava and surrounding areas", meaning a readership of around 7,000 people in the towns of: Snowtown, Blyth, Brinkworth, Clare, Watervale, Manoora, Port Wakefield, Balaklava, Auburn, Saddleworth, Riverton, Owen, Hamley Bridge, Tarlee, Kapunda, Dublin, Windsor, Lower Light, Mallala, Two Wells, Gawler, Wasleys, and Virginia. As of 2018, the newspapers weekly print run is around 3,500, representing a readership of around 10,000 people.
Awards.
The newspaper won the BankSA Best Newspaper award (with a circulation under 5,000) in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2008. It also won the Country Press SA Inc. award for best newspaper (under 3000 circulation) in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2008 and 2009.
Digitisation.
Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1903 to 1941, and 1946 to 1950, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service.

Smooth Sailing (Teddy Edwards album)

Smooth Sailing is the final album by the saxophonist Teddy Edwards. It was recorded in 2001 and released on the HighNote label in 2003.
Reception.
In his review on AllMusic, Scott Yanow writes: "Although veteran tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards was having serious health problems by 2001, he is in excellent form throughout this set, showing no signs of decline or age. Playing in New York with a top-notch quartet that includes pianist Richard Wyands, Edwards caresses some of the melodies (his long tones are impressive), he swings hard in spots, and he shows great affection for the material. ... Throughout, Teddy Edwards shows that in 2001 he was still in his musical prime." On "All About Jazz", Terrell Kent Holmes called it "a fine example of economical playing and arrangement" and noted "Edwards, now approaching 80 years old, shows on "Smooth Sailing" that he's as formidable a sax man as ever. More power to any septuagenerian who swings."

Peck and Hills Furniture Company Warehouse

The Peck and Hills Furniture Company Warehouse is a historic warehouse located at 909 West Bliss Street on Goose Island in Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1901, the warehouse was the main storage and distribution facility for the Peck and Hills Furniture Company. Founded in 1896, the company became the largest furniture distributor in the country by the end of the 1920s. The company's warehouse facilities, which were expanded significantly during its growth, were integral to its ability to expand into new markets. The warehouse also connected to the city's railway network, allowing the company to easily ship its goods across the country. Peck and Hills declined significantly during the Great Depression, and it sold its Chicago warehouse facilities in 1942. The warehouse is now one of the few remnants of Goose Island's industrial history.
The warehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 18, 2015.

Sebeto

The Sebéto was a river which ran through the Greek city of Neapolis, now Naples in Italy. 5th and 4th century BC coins show its ancient Greek name "Sepeithos", meaning 'fast-flowing'. It is commemorated by the Baroque Fontana del Sebeto.
Several ancient chronicles state that Neapolis was divided from Partenope or Palepolis by a river, partly navigable, "between monte S. Erasmo and monte di Patruscolo". This puts the river mouth on what is now the site of piazza Municipio. Quintus Publilius Philo camped his Roman army at this river mouth during his siege of the cities.

Raw intelligence

 
Raw intelligence is raw data gathered by an intelligence operation, such as espionage or signal interception. Such data commonly requires processing and analysis to make it useful and reliable. To turn the raw intelligence into a finished form, the steps required may include decryption, translation, collation, evaluation and confirmation.
In the period after the First World War, British practise was to circulate raw intelligence with little analysis or context. Such direct intelligence was a strong influence on policy-makers. Churchill was especially keen to see raw intelligence and was supplied this by Desmond Morton during his period outside the government. When Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he still insisted on receiving raw intelligence and wanted it all until it was explained that the volume was now too great. A selection of daily intercepts was provided to him each day by Bletchley Park and he called these his "golden eggs".
US intelligence has a different tradition from the British. The key event for the US was the failure to prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor and the inquiries which followed concluded that this was not due to the lack of raw intelligence so much as the failure to make effective use of it. The Central Intelligence Agency was created to collate, analyse and summarise the raw intelligence collected by the other departments. US agencies which focus on the collection of raw intelligence include the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency.

FAV Class E.440

 FAV Class E.440 was a class of four electric locomotives built for the Italian Ferrovia Alta Valtellina (FAV) in 1932 for the operation between Sondrio and Tirano. 
History.
In 1928, following the experience acquired in the three-phase high-voltage (10 kV) AC operation on the Rome - Sulmona line of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), a new locomotive, dual-voltage and dual-frequency, with a wheel arrangement of 1'D1' and a power output of 3,270 kW, was designed and registered as FS Class E.471. It was designed by the famous engineer Kalman Kando and was built in the CEMSA plant. Ten locomotives were ordered but the project was terminated prematurely and only one locomotive was completed. The early termination of the project caused severe economic difficulties for CEMSA so the company welcomed an order for four locomotives from FAV. It has been suggested that one of the FAV locomotives was a rebuild of E.471 but this seems unlikely because E.471 was a large 1'D1' machine while the FAV locomotives were relatively small D types. What is more likely is that some parts manufactured for the cancelled FS order were used in the construction of the FAV locomotives. The first three units, E.440.1-2-3 were delivered in 1932 but the fourth, E.440.4, had to be built by Officine Meccaniche (OM) and Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB) following the economic difficulties of CEMSA. The locomotives served on the line between Sondrio and Tirano until 1967, when they were withdrawn and replaced by diesel-powered trains.
Technical details.
The E.440 locomotives were the only three-phase Italian machines to have the "D" wheel arrangement. Current collection was by trolley poles with dual spades. There was a single asynchronous motor of 1,000 kW (1 hour rating). The motion was transmitted to the wheels by articulated connecting rods using the Kando system with an idle jackshaft. Two fixed speeds of 33 and 50 km/h were available by pole-changing (Kando-Blathy system). The locomotive had a rigid frame and the axle at the cab end had side play of 40mm. The livery was black.
Preservation.
By the 1980s, three units had been scrapped. E.440.3, restored in the workshops at Tirano, was sent to the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa where it is exhibited.

Colonization Road (film)

Colonization Road is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Michelle St. John and released in 2016. Hosted by comedian and activist Ryan McMahon and starting in his own hometown of Fort Frances, Ontario, the film explores the impact of Ontario's historic colonization road system, which formed the basis of the province's contemporary highway system, on First Nations people. Some towns and cities in the province still to this day have a street named Colonization Road, and the film led some of them to debate changing their road's name.
The film had a theatrical premiere in October 2016 at the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival, before airing on CBC Television's documentary series "Firsthand" on January 26, 2017. At the 6th Canadian Screen Awards in 2018, it received a nomination for the Donald Brittain Award for Best Social or Political Documentary Program.

Eduardo (rapper)

Carlos Eduardo Taddeo (born August 24, 1975), better known as Eduardo, is a rapper, songwriter, activist, educator, and Brazilian writer.
He is one of the founders and leaders of the Facção Central
 group, in which he was a vocalist and composer of all lyrics.
 He left the group on March 18, 2013. Eduardo influenced his musical career by his brother-in-law known as Equipado, who was his sister's boyfriend. Eduardo lectures throughout Brazil and periodically visits the Casa Foundation. Despite not having completed his elementary school, he encourages young people from the periphery to study in interviews, shows and lectures, saying that "having a diploma and being well informed is more audacious than carrying machine guns." In 2012, he launched "A Guerra não Declarada na Visão de um Favelado", his first book.
"Eduardo" (composer and performer) and "Dum-Dum" (performer) were born and grew up in favelas of São Paulo in an environment where social violence, criminality, drug trafficking and drug addiction were rampant. This violent past became a source of inspiration to "Eduardo's" political lyrics.
Still in 1989, he founded rap group Facção Central together with Nego (currently known as Rapper Mag) and Jurandir, the last two members left the group, while Garga and Dum-Dum joined Eduardo and started the group's activities. He remained as leader and main composer of the group's lyrics until March 18, 2013, when Eduard officially communicated in a video that was posted on Youtube announcing his departure from the group due to some personal disagreements and ideological differences.
Recently released a new single; "Conzpirasom" that was composed by rappers Kaskão (Trilha Sonora do Gueto) and by the writer Ferréz, in partnership with the designer and illustrator Alexandre De Maio.
On December 20, 2014 he announces his pre-release album A Fantástica Fábrica de Cadáver with the participation of artists such as Yzalú, A286, Dexter and Trilha Sonora do Gueto.

George Phillips (Watertown)

George Phillips (born Raynham, Norfolk England approx. 1593 – July 1, 1644) led, along with Richard Saltonstall, a group of English settlers up the Charles River to settle in what is now Watertown, Massachusetts in 1630. A Puritan who was part of the Great Migration from England to New England, Phillips was a contemporary of, and often shared differing views with, John Winthrop. He established the first Congregational Church in Watertown and was one of the early influencers of the Congregational Church in North America. His descendants number in the thousands and are well represented in American history in the clergy, local and national politics, business, and social justice arenas.
Background and early life.
Phillips was the son of Christopher Phillips of Raynham in the district of Gallow in Norfolk, England. He earned a B.A. from Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge in 1613, and subsequently earned an M.A. degree in 1617. There he was a classmate of John Allin. By 1630 Phillips was the village vicar of Boxted, Essex and was increasingly dissatisfied, as were many Puritans, with the continuance of Roman Catholic ritual and insufficient Calvinist influences on the Church of England. He and many of his parishioners chose to leave England and head for America.
Phillips joined John Winthrop on the Winthrop Fleet to emigrate to America on the Arbella, whose passengers included Winthrop and his family, Anne Bradstreet, Captain John Underhill, Thomas Dudley, and Richard Saltonstall. The ship left England on April 20, 1630, and arrived in Salem on June 12.
Founding of Watertown and First Congregational Church.
Phillips arrived with Saltonstall at what is now known as Gerry's Landing in what was initially known as the Saltonstall Plantation, in the summer of 1630. He called the first church together in July, and in late August he had 30 acres along the Charles River.
It is claimed that Phillips was the author of the Watertown Covenant signed by the founders of the town, which not only served as an organizing document but also as a declaration of a bill of rights whose authority comes from "God":
""We ... have undertaken (for the promoting of His glory, and the Church's good, and the honour of our blessed Jesus...) a long and hazardous voyage from… Old England in Europe, to New England in America; that we may walk before Him, and serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our lives ... and enter into a sure covenant with the Lord our God, and before Him, with one another, by oath... to renounce all idolatry and superstition, will-worship, all human traditions and inventions whatsoever in the worship of God; and forsaking all evil ways, do give ourselves wholly unto the Lord Jesus, to do Him faithful service, observing and keeping all His statutes, commands, and ordinances, in all matters concerning our reformation, His worship, administrations, ministry, and government, and in the carriage for ourselves among ourselves and one towards another, as He hath prescribed in His holy Word.Further swearing to cleave unto that [the Word of God] alone, and the true sense and meaning thereof to the utmost of our power, as unto the most clear light, and infallible rule, and all-sufficient canon in all things that concern us in this our way."
While Phillips was a Puritan, he expressed a greater tolerance and acceptance for differing Protestant thought. While critical of the Church of England, he was not an advocate of full separation. In fact, he signed a document entitled "The Humble Request" on the Arbella, explicitly denouncing a desire for separation. He was a supporter of Infant baptism and was tolerant of Baptist religious views, much to the consternation of John Winthrop. Phillips drafted signed and filed with the State House a petition to pardon a man who had been fined for possessing a Baptist tract. Arguably Phillips, in deviating from the strictness of Winthrop on the other side of the Charles in Boston, helped to lay the groundwork for the more inclusive spirit of today's Congregational churches. Cotton Mather once said of Phillips that he was "better acquainted with the true congregational church-discipline than most of the ministers who came with him to this country."
Phillips served on the committee of the Massachusetts General Court in the formulation of what became called the "Body of Liberties" issues in 1641. In 1642 Phillips was appointed to the Board of Overseers of the newly formed Harvard College in Cambridge.
Family.
Phillips had children by two wives. His first wife died soon after arriving in New England. Their children were:
By his second wife Elizabeth, Phillips had the following children:
He was likely related to Henry Phillips, his brother Nicholas, and Martin Phillips, all of Dedham, Massachusetts.
Phillips died in Watertown on July 1, 1644 and was buried the subsequent day in what is now called the Arlington Street Cemetery. Upon his death John Winthrop wrote "He was...a Godly man, specially gifted, and very peaceful in his place, much lamented of his own people and others."
Descendants.
Phillips' descendants became prominent members of Boston, Massachusetts life and are considered part of what were known as the Boston Brahmins. They include New England and national leaders in religion, academia, government, business and social justice. They include:
Legacy.
In 1855 a group of orthodox Trinitarian Christians founded a new church in Watertown, naming it the Philips Congregational Church in honor of Rev. Phillips. This church later merged with another Congregational Church, Payson Park United Church of Christ. The building is now owned by Redeemer Fellowship Church.
Phillips is specifically mentioned in a 1948 marker at the edge of the Charles River which honors him and Saltonstall at what is called Sir Richard's Landing. The text on the monument is as follows:
"Here Reverend George Phillips protest in 1632 against taxation without representation struck the first note of civil liberty heard in this wilderness."
Phillips also appears prominently on the Watertown Founders Monument.
A Phillips Street in Watertown is likely named after him.
The Phillips name appears prominently in academia with Phillips Andover and Phillips Exeter prepatoratory schools, as well as the Phillips Brooks House Association at Harvard.

Glenna Matoush

Glenna Matoush (born 1946) is a visual artist from Canada.
Many of her early works were depictions of daily activities of members from the Cree community of Lake Mistassini, where she lived. Her more recent work addresses the social and political realities of Aboriginal people, including environmental issues, the impact of AIDs, and the recovery of indigenous languages and cultures. 
Early life and education.
Matoush was born in 1946 in on the Rama Reserve, Ontario, Canada. She was the ninth of thirteen children. Her tribal affiliation is Ojibway. She moved to the Cree community of Lake Mistassini in 1971 and began raising a family. In 1992 she moved to Montreal, Quebec.
Her education includes Quetico Park Centre, Quetico, Ontario, 1964; School of Fine Arts, Elliot Lake, Quebec, 1965; Museum of Fine Arts and Design, Montreal, Quebec, 1966-68; University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta; Guilde graphique de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, 1976-80.
Artistic career.
Matoush began her artistic career as a printmaker. She turned to painting, collage, and mixed media starting in the 1990s. Matoush's work has been compared to that of Jackson Pollock. She uses bright colors in works that are abstract, but based on careful design. Thematically, she addresses memory, spirituality, and the power of the land through a Cree and Anishnaabe lens. Much of her work has a social commentary component, such as her series "Shaman Transporting Souls to the Heavens", in which she rebuts the idea that the petroglyphs in Ontario's Petroglyphs Provincial Park were made by vikings and not First Nations people. In "Not an Act of God", her subject is the devastating drowning of twelve thousand caribou caused by a dam opening. The work's title references the statement of former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa, who called the incident an "act of God."

Rodrigo da Cunha

D. Rodrigo da Cunha (1577 – 3 January 1643) was an important Portuguese prelate of the first half of the seventeenth century and who, as Archbishop of Lisbon, played an important role in supporting the restoration of Portuguese independence from Spain.
Biography.
D. Rodrigo was born in Lisbon, son of D. Pedro da Cunha, Lord of the Majorat of Tábua, and his wife Maria da Silva.
He began his studies at the College of Saint Anthony the Great ("Colégio de Santo Antão"), a Jesuit college in Lisbon. He received his doctorate in Canon Law at the University of Coimbra.
In his religious career, he passed the Holy Office as a deputy, and was an inquisitor in Lisbon. He was Bishop of Portalegre (1615-1618), and of Porto (1618-1626); was Archbishop of Braga (1626-1634) and Lisbon (1635-1642).
He authored the reform of the "Breviário Bracarense" in 1634, and presided over the Lisbon Synod of 1640.
D. Rodrigo da Cunha was one of the main opponents of the incorporation of Portugal in Spain, a policy followed by Philip IV of Spain. In 1638, he was even invited to become a cardinal in Madrid, refusing the offer.
During the Portuguese Restoration War, he supported the revolutionaries and, together with the Archbishop of Braga, ruled the kingdom until the return of João IV. His name appears as one of the main presences in the "Act of Accession and Oath of King John IV" performed on 15 December 1640. and as in the following act solemnly confirming it on 28 January 1641.
As a historian, D. Rodrigo da Cunha contributed to the historiography of the Church in Portugal, writing several works on Braga, Porto and Lisbon.
He died at the age of 65, on 3 January 1643. He is buried in the Cathedral of Lisbon.

Tilquin

Tilquin (or Gueuzerie Tilquin) is a Belgian lambic beer blendery based in Bierghes, Brussels, founded in 2009 by Pierre Tilquin. Tilquin is the only lambic blendery in the mainly French-speaking, southern region of Wallonia. Tilquin also is exclusively the only blendery that is allowed to blend of one, two, and three-year-old lambics with wort acquired from Boon, Lindemans, Girardin, and Cantillon breweries.
History.
The brewery was founded in 2009 by Pierre Tilquin, a bio-engineer and holder of a PhD in statistical genetics. Prior to opening the blendery, he studied brewing science in Leuven, apprenticed at some of the major breweries in Belgium, including Huyghe Brewery, 3 Fonteinen and Cantillon.
Tilquin produces blends of one, two, and three-year-old lambics with wort acquired from Boon, Lindemans, Girardin, and Cantillon for the Oude Gueuze Tilquin à L'Ancienne. While the first 2010-2011 labeled release of Oude Gueuze was reportedly a blend of just one and two-year-old lambics, all subsequent batches have been blends of one, two, and three-year-old lambics. The first known bottling of the gueuze occurred in December 2010 and was labelled as "1ier soutirage" ("1st racking). Tilquin has consistently produced lambic blends in 750ml and 375ml bottles for export every year since its opening.
In February 2012, Tilquin introduced its first fruited lambic with the release of a very limited batch of Oude Quetsche Tilquin à L'Ancienne, sold in 750ml bottles. The initial batch was limited to purchases at the brewery, but a second batch produced in January 2013 saw widespread release in Europe and North America later the same year. It was debuted to coincide with the 2013 Toer de Geuze.
In 2012, Gueuzerie Tilquin joined HORAL, the High Council for Artisanal Lambic Beers. Tilquin is the first HORAL member outside of Flanders and lies just 200 meters past the language border in the French-speaking municipality of Rebecq.
In March 2015, the Belgian daily newspaper "La Capitale" reported that 75% of Gueuzerie Tilquin's production was reserved for export with 40% of that being sent solely to the United States. Tilquin also participated in the 10th Anniversary Toer de Geuze in 2015. The weekend also saw the release of Tilquin's second fruited lambic, Oude Mûre Tilquin à l'Ancienne, a lambic fruited with blackberries. In addition to the Toer de Geuze, Tilquin also hosted an English beer festival.
In 2017, Tilquin began to expand their capacity with several more stainless steel tanks. These tanks will be used to continue larger scale production of fruited lambics following the first experimental fruit series.
Beers.
There are three blends. Distribution began in the United States in 2017.

Uta Merzbach

Uta Caecilia Merzbach (February 9, 1933 – June 27, 2017) was a German-American historian of mathematics who became the first curator of mathematical instruments at the Smithsonian Institution.
Early life.
Merzbach was born in Berlin, where her mother was a philologist and her father was an economist who worked for the Reich Association of Jews in Germany during World War II. The Nazi government closed the association in June 1943; they arrested the family, along with other leading members of the association, and sent them to the Theresienstadt concentration camp on August 4, 1943. The Merzbachs survived the war and the camp, and after living for a year in a refugee camp in Deggendorf they moved to Georgetown, Texas in 1946, where her father found a faculty position at Southwestern University.
Education.
After high school in Brownwood, Texas, Merzbach entered Southwestern, but transferred after two years to the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. In 1954, she earned a master's degree there, also in mathematics. Merzbach became a school teacher, but soon returned to graduate study at Harvard University.
She completed her Ph.D. at Harvard in 1965. Her dissertation, "Quantity of Structure: Development of Modern Algebraic Concepts from Leibniz to Dedekind", combined mathematics and the history of mathematics; it was jointly supervised by mathematician Garrett Birkhoff and historian of science I. Bernard Cohen.
Career.
Merzbach joined the Smithsonian as an associate curator in 1964, and served there until 1988 in the National Museum of American History. As well as collecting mathematical objects at the Smithsonian, she also collected interviews with many of the pioneers of computing. In 1991, she became the co-author of the second edition of "A History of Mathematics", originally published in 1968 by Carl Benjamin Boyer. After her retirement she returned to Georgetown, Texas, where she died in 2017.

Filippino Doria

Filippo or Filippino Doria (between 1470 and 1480, Genoa - between 1548 and 1558) was a Genoese admiral from a cadet branch of the Doria family. 
Life.
He was one of two sons of Bartolomeo Doria and Lucrezia Del Carretto, making him a nephew of Andrea Doria. He became a soldier at an early age since the family fortune was only modest. He initially served the della Rovere family then Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. He left Urbino's service sometime after reaching his majority around 1510, returning to the della Rovere family in the form of pope Julius II. He served under Andrea Doria, who put him in command of the war against the Barbary pirates by the Papal States and their French allies. In 1519 Filippino won attention for his major contribution to the victory at the battle of Pianosa by attacking the pirate from the rear with two galleys just when all seemed lost. He confirmed his allegiance to Andrea by accompanying him in his flight from Genoa after it was sacked by the Spanish in 1522 - the pair took four galleys and sailed to Monaco to enter the service of Francis I of France.
He probably took part with Andrea in his conspiracy against Luciano Grimaldi, the defence of Marseille from the sea in 1524, the supply chain down the Rhone, the lucky capture of Philibert of Chalon and the daring plan to spring Francis from captivity after the battle of Pavia. The pair entered pope Clement VII's service after Pavia - he was then an ally of France. Andrea left his eight galleys under his nephew's command in Civitavecchia while he went to Rome to discuss naval strategy with Clement. Filippino took two ships to Portofino to assist in holding off an attack by doge Antoniotto Adorno in September 1526, which was aimed at relieving the blockade of Genoa. When news of the Sack of Rome reached Andrea's fleet, it sailed from Liguria to Fiumicino to aid Clement - Filippino made a failed attempt to land a group of soldiers and spring the pope from his effective captivity in Castel Sant'Angelo. The fleet sailed back towards Genoa, with Clement unable to pay it. The contract between Andrea and Clement expired in August 1527 and the fleet switched back to French service, with Francis I making Andrea his supreme naval commander in the Mediterranean. 
The fleet sailed to Savoy to pick up marshal Lautrec and his troops for a new campaign against the Empire. Filippino was attacked on land and captured on 15 August, but Andrea's reaction was instantaneous, forcing Adorno to abandon Genoa on 19 August. Once freed, Filippino seems to have opened the gates of the city to his cousin and to Cesare Fregoso. In September Andrea and Filippino attacked Castello Aragonese on Sardinia, but they were hit by a storm as well as a stout defence and so Filippino was reassigned to occupy Sassari. Still under Andrea's orders, he then brought his cousin's seven galleys and Antonio's galleys into Livorno to repair over the winter. When the naval war resumed in spring 1528, Andrea was ordered to sail to assist Lautrec in the siege of Naples, but refused and instead sent Filippino with eight galleys. He anchored in the Gulf of Salerno, blockading the city and killing Naples' governor Hugo of Moncada when he attempted a breakout by sea on 28 April. 
Both he and Andrea then went over to the Empire in June-August 1528, returning to free Naples from the French and then arriving off Genoa on 10 September. That night, Filippino led one of two landing parties which stormed the city shouting "St George and liberty!", capturing the town hall and city gate. He then starved out the garrison in the Castelletto fortress and captured Savoy. In 1529 Andrea made him captain general and the doge made him gonfalone of the Republic of Venice. He helped save Andrea from the Fieschi conspiracy in 1547, leading a band of 2,000 men with Agostino Spinola to defeat the last rebel stronghold at Montoggio. He predeceased Andrea sometime between 1548 and 1558.

Piano Trio, Op. 28 (Ries)

The Trio for Piano, Clarinet and Cello in B-flat major, Op. 28, was composed by Ferdinand Ries in either Bonn in 1809 or Aachen in 1810 during the period he left Vienna to avoid being drafted into the Austrian army. It was published in 1811 by Simrock with a dedication to a Mademoiselle Clairette Ludwigs.
Composition history.
Little is known about the precise circumstances under which the composer wrote this trio. Martin Harlow in his thesis points out that the composer listed the work as being composed in 1809 in Bonn in his thematic catalog, while Bert Hagels, in the liner notes to the cpo recording states that he believes the work was composed in Aachen about a year later.
The publication of the work in 1811 by Simrock is well documented, but there is no surviving documentation relating to the first performance of the work. The publication history of the work, which shows that the work was printed multiple times, suggests that the work was well received.
Instrumentation.
The Trio is scored for piano, clarinet (or violin) and cello.
Structure.
The composition is in four movements:
Hagels points out in his liner notes that, while using the instrumentation and key of Beethoven's Op. 11 Trio, the structure of Ries's Op. 28 Trio makes use of a four movement plan similar to the older composers Op.1 Piano Trios or the Op. 9 String Trios. Both Harlow and Robert Silvertrust state that, in this work, Ries managed to compose a work that was not a chamber concerto for piano but true chamber music, where all three instruments share in the thematic material. Harlow speculates that in the case of the cello, this may have been due to the influence of cellist, Bernhard Romberg, a former teacher and dedicatee of Ries's Opp.20 and 21 cello sonatas. Both authors agree, however that at one point in the work the piano becomes dominant, Silvertrust believed this moment occurs in the "Adagio" movement, where the piano states the theme for the cello to repeat. Harlow, believes that this moment lies in the last movement where the piano is given virtuoso passagework causing it to overshadow the other instruments.

Bolla Aqueduct

The Bolla Aqueduct was an aqueduct in Italy, measuring 8 kilometres. It connected Naples with a marshy depression near Mount Vesuvius, which was in turn supplied by an aquifer of pyroclastic and sedimentary deposits laid down in Vesuvius' many eruptions. It reached the city at Porta Capuana before splitting into a network of underground channels leading to private wells. Its date of construction is unknown, but is estimated sometime between the 5th century BC and the Middle Ages. It remained a major water source for the city until being replaced by the Serino aqueduct in the late 19th century. The Bolla still supplies water to outer areas of Naples for industrial use.

DoggoLingo

 
DoggoLingo, also referred to as doggotalk, woof, bork, and dog-speak, is an Internet language that is created from word conversion, meme lexicon, and onomatopoeia. DoggoLingo is implied to be a dog's own idiom, and is presented as what humans have long believed goes on in the canine brain. Elyse Graham, assistant professor at Stony Brook University, describes DoggoLingo as "upbeat, joyful, and clueless in a relentlessly friendly way".
Structure.
DoggoLingo appends various diminutive suffixes "-o", "-er", "-ino" to existing English words (e.g. "dog" turns into "doggo", "pup" turns into "pupper") as well as DoggoLingo words that have been created (e.g. "pupper" turns into "pupperino", "bork" turns into "borker"). DoggoLingo relies heavily upon onomatopoeia: Words such as "blep", "blop" and "mlem" describe the action of a dog sticking out its tongue; "bork", "boof", "woof" describe the various canine barking sounds. A dog with a fluffy coat may be called a "floof" or a "fluff". DoggoLingo follows a similar rudimentary style to create its verbs (e.g. "doin me a" in place of present participles, such as "doin me a scare" "scaring me") and adjectives (e.g. "heckin" in place of degree modifiers such as "extremely"). 'Heck' is frequently used in place of more conventional expletives. Some words also come from eye dialect spellings of English words, such as "fren" "friend".
Origin.
The exact origin of DoggoLingo is unknown. Various social media accounts such as WeRateDogs (Twitter), Dogspotting (Facebook), as well as social news aggregation and imageboard websites like 4chan, Reddit, or Tumblr have aided in popularizing the use of DoggoLingo by consistently using or hosting content that uses the lingo on their Internet pages. In 2014, the Dogspotting Facebook account gained popularity, especially in Australia where coincidentally adding "-o" to the end of words is also a feature of Australian slang.
Other animals.
Some other animals are referred to differently in DoggoLingo: One would refer to a snake as "snek" or "danger noodle", a human being as "hooman", a cat as "catto" (cf. "doggo"), a bird as "birb" etc.
Internet fan groups for other animals have adopted many of the conventions of DoggoLingo for their own related languages for their preferred animals (like "Posso" or "Poss-speak" for opossums). Lolcats may be a precursor to DoggoLingo. Many aspects of DoggoLingo have also been adopted into the slang terminology of the furry fandom, called “furspeech”.

Laurent Mbanda

Laurent Mbanda (born 25 October 1954) is a Rwandan Anglican bishop. He was the bishop of the Diocese of Shyira when he was elected the fourth Archbishop and Primate of the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda on 17 January 2018, being enthroned on 10 June 2018.
Ecclesiastical career.
He was born in Rwanda but spent a large part of his childhood in Burundi. He graduated at the Kenya Highlands Bible College, in Kericho, Kenya, before returning to Burundi, where he was ordained an Anglican priest. He moved to the United States in 1984, where he completed course work for an M.A. in Missiology at the Fuller Seminary's School of World Missions, in Pasadena, United States, a Master of Arts in Christian Education at Denver Seminary and a PhD at Trinity International University, in Deerfield, Illinois.
He was consecrated Bishop of the Diocese of Shyiria in March 2010. He was elected the fourth Archbishop and Primate of the Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda on 17 January 2018, among five candidates, during the meeting the House of Bishops at St. Étienne Cathedral, in Kigali, and his enthronement took place on 10 June. 
He has been a longtime supporter of GAFCON, since he attended their first meeting in Jerusalem, in June 2008. He attended GAFCON III, in Jerusalem, from 17-22 June 2018.
He published "Committed to Conflict: The Destruction of the Church in Rwanda" (1997), co-written with Steve Wamberg, about the Rwandan genocide, and his autobiography, "From Barefoot to Bishop" (2017).
Views on church/state relations in Rwanda.
In his book "Committed to Conflict" Mbanda wrote: The Hebraic model of theocracy, which would link spiritual leaders with political power, failed to become reality in Rwanda, but made a significant impact on the political leadership. Church leaders in Africa, and elsewhere, have to be careful to avoid combining religious and political functions. Church and mission leaders must watch the relationship between church and state, as these can be dangerous for the Church. In Rwanda they have demonstrated patterns of manipulation within the Church, and the abuse of governmental relationships by the Church.

Petra Theater

Petra Theater () is a first century AD Nabataean theatre situated 600 m from the centre of Petra. Substantial part of the theater was carved out of solid rock, while the scaena and exterior wall were constructed. The theater's auditorium consists of three horizontal sections of seats separated by passageways and seven stairways to ascend. The theater could accommodate a number of approximately 8500 people, more than the estimated number of Amman theater. Petra Theater follows similar architectural patterns of Roman theaters, which enhances superior acoustics.
History.
The theater was built in the cultural and political apex of the Nabataean kingdom under Aretas IV (9 BC-40 AD), where large scale civic construction projects in Petra and other important Nabataean trading cities in Hijaz and the Negev took place. It is said that the theater-building activities of Herod the Great may have urged the Nabataean king to follow lead. The massive theater with its large capacity was positioned to bring the greatest number of tombs within view.
Although Roman in design, being carved out opposed to being built is characteristically distinctive Nabataean style and not a Roman manner. The floral capitals of the theater are also distinctively Nabataean artistic element. Minor alterations of the theater were made by Aretas son Malichus II and later on the Romans who re-built the exterior wall.

The World Only Spins Forward

The World Only Spins Forward: The Ascent of Angels in America is an oral history of the play "Angels in America", first published in 2018. Theater director and writer Isaac Butler and journalist Dan Kois co-authored the history based upon interviews conducted in 2016–2017 with people involved with the play in different ways. The oral history was originally compiled by the authors for the 2016 "Slate" cover story ""Angels in America": The Complete Oral History". The release of the book commemorated the 25th anniversary of the play's Broadway theatre premiere in 1993.
Overview.
The oral history draws from around 250 interviews with people directly and indirectly involved with "Angels in America", ranging from its playwright Tony Kushner to former Congressman Barney Frank. Quotes from these interviews are combined with relevant selections from the play, contemporary press coverage, and photos to tell the story of the play, its context, and its impact. The book begins by setting the social and political context for the work, exploring how such events as the 1978 assassination of Harvey Milk and the beginnings of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s influenced and inspired Kushner's writing of the play. It then follows the writing, development, and initial production history of the play, examining how it went from a small theater in San Francisco to winning the Tony Award for Best Play during its Broadway run. The social and political impacts of the play are also explored, as well as its legacy in the theater world and its continued importance and relevance as a work of art. The book also covers how subsequent productions of the play, such as those in politically conservative areas, came to be and how their audiences and communities reacted to them.
Reviews.
Steven Winn, writing for SFGate, praised the authors' ability to capture the lasting significance of "Angels in America" and to vividly depict what goes into great theater, but noted that the amount of detail included in the book was sometimes overwhelming. Alyssa Rosenberg of "The Washington Post" described the history as a "vital book about how to make political art that offers lasting solace in times of great trouble, and wisdom to audiences in the years that follow."

Diocese of Thucca Terenbenthina

The Diocese of Thucca Terenbenthina is an ancient Titular See of the Roman Catholic Church.
The diocese is also known as Tucca Terebentina or دڨة , (Latin : Dioecesis Thuccensis Terebenthina ).
History.
Also known as Tucca Terebentina, the diocese is an ancient episcopal see of the Roman province of Byzacena. In antiquity the bishopric was centered on Dougga.
The diocese was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal and Orthodox Byzantine empires, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The bishopric was re-founded in name at least in the 20th century and it remains today a Roman Catholic Church titular see.
Very little is known of the history of the Bishopric. The donatist bishop Pascasio, who was present at the Carthage conference of 411 may have belonged to this town but it is uncertain.
Today Thucca Terebentina survives as a titular bishop's seat having been re-founded in the 1930s and the current titular bishop is Gerardo Antonio Zerdín Bukovec, apostolic vicar of San Ramón.
Modern bishops have included:

Vietnam Talking Blues

"Vietnam Talking Blues" (sometimes titled " Vietnam Talkin’ Blues") is an American folk-style song by Phil Ochs, a U.S folk singer specializing in protest songs. His career began in the 1960s with his outspoken resistance to the Vietnam War. Formally released in his debut album, "All the News That’s Fit to Sing", "Vietnam Talking Blues" held the third position on the album, coming in at 3 minutes and 38 seconds long.
"Vietnam Talking Blues" was relevant and timely, being “the first protest song to directly refer to Vietnam by name.” Ochs released the album "All the News That’s Fit to Sing" in April 1964, “a full four months before the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and the first major escalation of the American presence in Vietnam.”

K2-148b

K2-148b is a confirmed super-Earth, probably rocky, closely orbiting a small orange dwarf star. It is the innermost of three Super-Earths around the star K2-148, which is in a wide binary pair with the M0.5V red dwarf EPIC 220194953. K2-148b is the smallest planet of the system, at about a third larger than Earth, and could be terrestrial in nature. However, the three planets do not exhibit significant transit timing variations, implying that they could have relatively low masses. The planet was validated in early 2018 by Hirano "et al." and is too hot for known life.
Characteristics.
Mass, radius, and temperature.
K2-148b is a Super-Earth, meaning that it is larger than Earth but smaller than the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Because it was detected with the transit method, only the radius of the planet is known. It is 1.33 , about a third larger than Earth. A planet of this size is likely rocky, and with an Earth-like composition, K2-148b would have a mass of about 2.5 . Since K2-148b is in a multiple planet system, transit timing variations could be used to determine the masses of the planets by seeing how the planets pull on each other and slightly change when they transit the star. However, the TTVs of the K2-148 system were quite low, which may mean that K2-148b is not rocky.
The planet is quite hot due to its proximity to its host star, with an equilibrium temperature of , far too high for liquid water to exist on its surface. It receives about 48 times more sunlight than Earth gets from the Sun.
Orbit.
K2-148b has a tight orbit around its host star. It only takes about 4.4 Earth days for the planet to complete one full orbit around its star, with a semi-major axis of 0.0454 AU. For comparison, the innermost planet in our Solar System, Mercury, takes 88 days to orbit at a distance of 0.38 AU. The eccentricity and inclination of K2-148b's orbit are currently unknown.
Host star.
K2-148b orbits a late-K dwarf star known as K2-148, or EPIC 220194974. It is 63% the radius, 65% the mass, and 10% the luminosity of the Sun, with a temperature of 4079 K and an unknown age. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old. It is orbited by a slightly smaller M0.5V red dwarf known as EPIC 220194953 at a distance of 1,100 AU. The companion star is about 58% the radius, 60% the mass, and 6.6% as luminous as the Sun with a temperature of 3854 K. EPIC 220194953 is slightly more metal-rich than K2-148, and the two are confirmed to be gravitationally bound to each other.

Microtis oblonga

Microtis oblonga, commonly known as the sweet onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to south-eastern Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty scented, bright green flowers. It is considered by some Australian authorities to be synonymous with "Microtis rara".
Description.
"Microtis oblonga" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty bright green, sweetly scented flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are long, about wide and usually curve forwards. The labellum is oblong, long, wide with irregular edges and turns downward towards the ovary. There is a raised, dark green callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to February.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis oblonga" was first formally described in 1923 by Richard Sanders Rogers and the description was published in "Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia". It is regarded by many Australian authorities as being a synonym of "Microtis rara". The specific epithet ("oblonga") is a Latin word meaning "longer than broad".
Distribution and habitat.
The sweet onion orchid grows between grasses and shrubs in open forest from Gympie in Queensland south through New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania and west to south-eastern South Australia.

<doc id="56689084" url="?curid=56689084" title="Octopus maya">
Octopus maya

Octopus maya, known colloquially as the Mexican four-eyed octopus, is a shallow water octopus that can be found in the tropical Western Atlantic Ocean. It is common to sea grass prairies and coral formations. The species was initially discovered in an octopus fishery in Campeche Mexico, where its close external resemblance to "Octopus vulgaris" led to its mistaken grouping with the other species. "O. maya" makes up 80% of octopus catch in the Yucatán Peninsula, while O. vulgaris makes up the remaining 20%.
"Octopus maya" can be identified by its large, double-ringed ocellus (a false eye spot) and large egg size (averaging 17mm). The mantle is muscular, large, and oval in shape. There is some variation in the definite shape of the posterior end of the mantle, but all are fairly narrow and meet the head at a characteristically narrow neck. Females grow to be larger than males, weighing in at 1024g with mantles measuring 124mm. Males grow to be about 484g with mantles 91mm long. They are usually dark brown in color but may turn red when agitated. They are also able to mimic the color of the sand on the seafloor. The ocellus is a dark red brown and found directly beneath the eye between the second and third arm. It has been found in depths between 3 and 25m along the continental shelf of the Yucatán Peninsula.
Habitat.
Campeche Bank is located off of the Yucatán Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. It extends about 125 miles into the Gulf where it suddenly drops off, ending it the Alacran Reef. There are very low levels of sediments along the Bank between the shore and the reef. The benthic environment in this region can be characterized by fine carbonate sand. The strong currents the flow westward along the bank year round likely contribute to the nature of the benthic sand and lack of sediments.
Diet.
"Octopus maya" is known to feed primarily on benthic prey such as crustaceans, bivalves, fish, gastropods, other octopuses, and even birds. Two specific prey items that "O. maya" commonly feeds on are blue crab ("Callinectes sapidus") and the crown conch snail ("Melongena corona bispinosa"). Neurotoxins in "O. maya"’s saliva cause temporary paralysis in its prey, allowing for easier consumption. This paralytic also works on conspecifics, leading researchers to believe that it is used in territorial defense as well as intraspecific competition. Beyond the chemicals found in their saliva, not much is known about hunting techniques specific to "O. maya". However, looking at sister taxa, including the closely related Common Octopus ("Octopus vulgaris"), can shed some light on likely mechanisms used by "O. maya". "O vulgaris" has been observed using its strong suckers to restrain its prey, while carrying the victim toward its mouth. The octopus can then inject the organism with saliva, drilling holes into the bodies of shelled organisms such as crabs and bivalves using its beak as necessary, and consume its prey.
Lifespan and reproduction.
"Octopus maya" is semelparous, meaning that females die following a single round of reproduction. Males are able to reproduce multiple times during their reproductive phase, but only survive for a single spawning season. This period of activity during which males actively search for a mate makes them much more vulnerable to predators. The male will fertilize the female’s eggs internally, then the female will carry them within her body for between 14 and 50 days until spawning. The spawning process lasts approximately 5 days, during which the female will deposit her eggs in a den for incubation. The female blows jets of water over the strands of eggs to keep them clean and ventilated, as well as providing protection to them until hatching. During this period, the female will not leave the eggs to eat, resulting in her death shortly after her offspring hatch. The incubation period for "O. maya" typically lasts between 30 and 35 days, although there may be individual variation.
Conservation and climate change.
"Octopus maya" is sensitive to temperatures exceeding 27 degrees Celsius. As increased temperatures it suffers a decrease in fitness and reproductive capabilities. Thus, rising ocean temperatures pose a serious threat to this species. Continued fishing of this octopus along with dwindling populations could quickly become serious as the processes of climate change causes continued rise in ocean temperatures

West Coast Sentinel

The West Coast Sentinel is a weekly newspaper published Thursdays in Ceduna, South Australia. It was founded in mid-1912, and has been published continuously since then. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media.
History.
The "West Coast Sentinel" (subtitled: "circulating throughout the Great West Coast. Eyre's Peninsula") began publication in Streaky Bay on Friday 28 June 1912. At the time, its publishers hoped that the paper's reach would extend beyond its initial region stating, "...although the journal is to be published at Streaky Bay it will serve the whole West Coast, and endeavor to safeguard interests and foster development of the smallest, equally the largest town or settlement".
On 25 April 1925, the title of the newspaper was simplified to "West Coast Sentinel", with a subtitle that read "A Weekly Paper alive to the needs of the West Coast." and a subtitle that read: "The only paper published on the great West Coast of S.A." In 1930, due to pressures from the Great Depression, the newspaper absorbed the Western Mail (13 July 1928 - 25 December 1930), which was printed by A.C. Lawrie. In addition, the newspaper also printed the short-lived Eyre Peninsula Rural Chronicle (1987–1990), and a sister publication, the "Peninsula Farmer", in conjunction with the "Port Lincoln Times".
Alongside many other rural publications in Australia, the newspaper was a member of Fairfax Media Limited.
Distribution.
The newspaper is published every Thursday, a print run of approximately 3,000 copies which are sold across the Eyre Peninsula and Far West including: Ceduna, Streaky Bay, Wudinna, Elliston, Yalata, Nundroo, Penong, Thevenard, Smoky Bay, Port Kenny, Venus Bay, Wirrulla, Poochera, Minnipa, and Kyancutta. It has a claimed average weekly readership of 5,600. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online.
Digitisation.
Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1912 to 1954, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service.

Wallace Bligh Cheesman

Wallace Bligh Cheesman (1865 – 1947) was a British trade union leader and political activist.
Born in the Gad's Hill area of Higham, Kent, Cheesman began working for the Post Office. In 1890, he was a founder member of the Fawcett Association, a trade union for post office workers, and he served as its general secretary from 1891. The following year, he was sacked from the Post Office on the grounds that he had circulated information about candidates in the 1892 general election. He supported the Labour Representation Committee, attending its founding conference, and he served on its National Executive Committee in 1902/03.
While secretary of the Fawcett Association, Cheesman also served for many years as the honorary secretary of the United Government Workers' Federation, and as editor of its journal, the "Government Workers' Advocate". He remained secretary of the Fawcett Association until the end of 1919, when he took it into a merger which formed the Union of Post Office Workers. He served as the first assistant secretary of the new union, but retired in the mid-1920s, when he reached the age limit set for officials of the new union. He then became secretary of the small Royal Parks Employees' Union.

ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It was created by Nicholas C. Zakas in 2013. Rules in ESLint are configurable, and customized rules can be defined and loaded. ESLint covers both code quality and coding style issues. ESLint supports current standards of ECMAScript, and experimental syntax from drafts for future standards. Code using JSX or TypeScript can also be processed when a plugin or transpiler is used.
History.
Both JSLint and JSHint were lacking the ability to create additional rules for code quality and coding style. After contributing to JSHint, Zakas decided to create a new linting tool in June 2013, ESLint (originally called JSCheck, but renamed a month later), where all rules are configurable, and additional rules can be defined or loaded at run-time.
In April 2016, the ESLint project joined the jQuery Foundation. Later that year, jQuery Foundation merged with Dojo Foundation to become JS Foundation as a Linux Foundation project.
In October 2017, the ESLint project became a "Graduate Project" of the JS Foundation through its mentorship program.
As of March 2019, ESLint is part of the OpenJS Foundation, following a merge between the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation.
Adoption.
Since 1999, JetBrains provides integrated support for ESLint in their WebStorm code editor, which runs the ESLint software as configured for the current text file, and displays any warnings near the offending lines of code in the editor.
Since 2016, the Vue.js project provides an ESLint plugin to automatically validate use of Vue.js templates and other features. Since 2018, this plugin is also promoted in the wizard for creating new Vue.js projects.
In October 2018, the React project (developed by Facebook) published an official ESLint plugin to help enforce their coding rules.
As of 2021, ESLint is the most commonly used JavaScript linter and is being downloaded over 14,000,000 times per week.

João de Sousa

D. João de Sousa (1647 - 28 September 1710) was a Portuguese prelate, Bishop of Porto, Archbishop of Braga and Archbishop of Lisbon.
Biography.
D. João was the son of Tomé de Sousa, 8th Lord of Gouveia with Francisca de Meneses, and nephew of Dom Diogo de Sousa, Archbishop of Évora.
He graduated in canons at the University of Coimbra, and afterwards entered the service of the Holy Office, he was a deputy in Évora, being already Archdeacon of Santa Cristina, in the Archbishopric of Braga, also holding the position of "sumilher" to Pedro II of Portugal. In 1682, he served in the Armada and went to Turin to aid the Duke of Savoy as his "sumilher". On his return, at the time when Diogo de Sousa, his uncle, was Archbishop of Évora; he held the position of President of the Ecclesiastical Relation of that city. He was, afterwards deputy of the Inquisition of Lisbon, having refused the priory of Palmela and the Bishopric of Miranda. Nevertheless, he accepted the place of Bishop of Porto and had his elevation confirmed by Pope Innocent XI in 1684, being consecrated on April 16 by Cardinal D. Veríssimo de Lencastre, assisted by Bishop Manuel Pereira, Bishop-emeritus of St. Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro and by D. Antonio de Santa Maria, Titular Bishop of Diocaesarea in Isauria. He remained in the diocese until 1696, when he was elevated to Archbishop of Braga. His solemn entry took place on 29 June 1697. D. João remained in that post until 1703, when he was transferred to Lisbon. By his work and extreme humility, he received praises in the Apostolic Brief of Pope Innocent XII.
Kings Pedro II and João V made efforts to elevate the archbishop to cardinal, but when he was to be appointed by Pope Clement XI, he died on 29 September 1710. He is buried in the cemetery of the poor in the old cathedral, without epitaph and in humble burial, as he had wanted.

Mars Micro Orbiter

Mars Micro Orbiter (MMO) is a spacecraft mission concept that would place a small and inexpensive satellite in orbit around the planet Mars to study some aspects of the Mars atmosphere in visible and infrared wavelengths.
The orbiter study will undergo a preliminary design review in March 2018, potentially launching as a secondary payload on another mission in 2020.
Overview.
In April 2015, NASA's Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program requested proposals for interplanetary CubeSat investigations, and received 22 submissions. The MMO was not selected for launch, but in 2017 it was awarded grants for further technology development.
In 2015, the concept considered a 6U CubeSat with potential to also serve as an orbital communication relay for Mars surface-based missions, and by 2017 it had evolved to a 12U CubeSat; that is about 16 kg, and measuring 20×20×30 cm. The orbiter study will undergo a preliminary design review in March 2018, potentially launching as a secondary payload on another mission in 2020.
The Principal Investigator is Michael Malin, from Malin Space Science Systems.
Objectives.
The MMO would study the Mars atmosphere in visible and infrared wavelengths from Mars orbit. The science measurements include:

TechOlympics is an information technology (IT) conference for high school students. It connects students with IT professionals and with companies in order to promote the field of IT. The conference is held in the Millennium Hotel in Cincinnati, Ohio. The event is run by the INTERalliance of Greater Cincinnati, a non-profit organization seeking to empower students through a robust knowledge of IT. Colleges and other organizations are present at the event as well. Schools often attend as groups, but individual attendance is also permitted. The conference takes place over the course of one weekend, starting of Friday and going until midday Sunday. The events that take place during the conference fall into one of four categories: a Breakout, a Competition, a Showcase Demonstration, or a Speaker Presentation. However, there are other events that do not fit into one of these categories. Each year, the theme of the conference changes, and as such, so do the Breakouts and competitions offered, as well as the speakers presenting.
Breakouts.
TechOlymipcs offers the opportunity for students to learn from professionals through Breakouts. Breakouts are talks that typically last one hour long and generally focus on IT. A selected list of topics covered in past Breakouts is provided below.
Competitions.
TechOlympics is home to many competitions ranging from Wikiracing to competitive hacking. Below is a selected list of competitions.
Showcase Demonstrations.
A showcase project is large project that a group of students, often from the same school, take part in working on, in order to present the project to a panel of judges. This project is in competition with other projects to be the best project submitted. Winning this event is seen as a very important feat during the conference.
Speaker Presentations.
Generally, after each meal, students will hear from a speaker, often one with an IT background, that discusses the merits of entering the IT field.

Pranas Puskunigis

Pranas Puskunigis (16 July 1860 – 27 November 1946) was a Lithuanian musician, one of the first and most influential proponents of kanklės. During his life, he taught about 120 people how to play kanklės and established several ensembles, one of which is still active. He laid the groundwork for kanklės education and adapted numerous folk and professional songs to the instrument, but did not attempt to modify its design.
Early life.
Puskunigis was born on 16 July 1860 in the village near Sintautai, Augustów Governorate, Congress Poland. His father was well respected in the community and acted as a priest in an emergency. Therefore, it is said that his nickname "puskunigis" (literally: "half-priest") became the surname of his children. After three years at the Sintautai primary school, Puskunigis attended the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. But his mother's death forced him to abandon studies and return to farming.
He learned to play kanklės from his uncle, got introduced to a violin and clarinet in Veiveriai. In 1882, he moved to Kaunas where he worked at various churches and learned to play the piano and organ. For a time he lived in the United States, but returned in 1905 and settled in near Veiveriai. He had a small farm of , but devoted his time and energy to the music. He once again became a church organist and organized an ensemble of kanklės players, mostly from the students at the Veiveriai Teachers' Seminary. Its first performance was in 1906 at the nearby Sasnava. This ensemble, known simply as Kanklės since 1984, continues to this day. Puskunigis manufactured numerous kanklės that had 11 or 12 strings.
World War I and after.
During World War I, Saliamonas Banaitis invited Puskunigis to establish an ensemble of kanklės players at his printing press in Kaunas. The ensemble began giving performances in late 1915. Accompanied by a student choir from the Saulė Gymnasium (led by Banaitis' son and future composer ), the ensemble organized a concert at the Kaunas City Theater on 5 January 1916. The ensemble also performed at a fair in Königsberg. In 1922, Puskinigis was invited by General to organize an ensemble that would perform during the official state ceremonies at the Kaunas War Museum. He gathered a group of veterans of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and experienced players from Skriaudžiai which debuted in May 1923 but due to conflicts the project was soon abandoned. Puskunigis was then invited by a school in Šančiai where he trained about 60 students. The school ensemble debuted at the Vytautas' the Great Church during the first Lithuanian Song Festival in 1924 and recorded several songs with the operatic tenor Kipras Petrauskas.
In June 1925, Puskunigis was one of the founders of the Kanklės Players' Society, chaired by and . The same year Puskunigis was interviewed by Armas Otto Väisänen, the Finnish scholar of folk music. In 1925–1926, Puskunigis petitioned the Lithuanian government for a permit and funding to open Kanklės Musical School three times. The permit was finally received in 1930 and he became a teacher. Lithuanian composers, such as Juozas Naujalis and Juozas Gruodis, considered kanklės to be an obsolete instrument and did not support the efforts of Puskunigis. At the same time, Puskunigis protested efforts to improve and modernize kanklės. Therefore, he soon retired from the musical school and spent remainder of his life in Skriaudžiai. He spent the time correcting and organizing his writings – note sheets, original and translated articles, songs, poems. His son counted 48 songs created by Puskunigis. His most successful songs are (The Anthem of Kanklės Players) and (A Song about the Past). His textbook on kanklės was published in 1932. In 1937, he recorded 34 songs. He died in 1946 in Skriaudžiai. His home in Skriaudžiai was turned into a museum of the 19th-century lifestyle in 1987.

Aggala (Sinhala: අග්ගලා) are a traditional Sri Lankan sweet. They are essentially sweet roasted rice balls, made from rice, coconut, jaggery or treacle and pepper.
Traditionally sun-dried boiled rice is ground into a powder (alternatively rice flour can be used) and mixed with fresh shredded or desiccated coconut, shaved jaggery (which can be substituted with Kithul treacle or sugar), pepper and water until it forms a thick paste. The mixture is then rolled into small balls, and coated with rice powder/flour. Other recipes include the addition of cinnamon into the mixture and coating the balls with roasted sesame seeds. They are eaten as snacks.

Erasto Gaertner Hospital is a health institution in Curitiba, in the Brazilian state of Paraná. It specializes in the clinical and surgical treatment of patients with oncological diseases.
History.
The hospital was created on the initiative of Dr. Erasto Gaertner, who, on January the 2nd, 1952, donated a land of to the Paraná League for Combat of Cancer (Liga Paranaense de Combate ao Cancer - LPCC) for the construction of what today is Erasto Gaertner Hospital. On June 11, 1955 the hospital's cornerstone was placed.
Before being officially inaugurated, patients with cancer were treated since 1970 when Paulo Pimentel, governor of Paraná State, donated a cobalt pump, that allowed 47 sessions of radiotherapy per day. The local community and volunteers gathered resources to finalize and effectively inaugurate the Erasto Gaertner Hospital, on December 8, 1972.
In the beginning, the hospital offered basic clinical and surgical care, attending few patients in an operating room, with a radiotherapy device and the cobalt pump.
Nowadays, the hospital is considered the largest cancer treatment center in South Brazil.

Joachim Steinbacher

Joachim Steinbacher (18 November 1911 – 31 July 2005) was a German ornithologist and curator at the Senckenberg-Museum in Frankfurt. He was a writer of both scientific and popular books on birds and served as editor of the avicultural periodical "Gefiederte Welt".
Steinbacher was born in Hoexter on the river Weser and he grew up in Goslar in the Harz mountains. His interest in natural history as a child was nurtured by his uncle Friedrich Steinbacher who lived in Berlin along with another ornithologist cousin Georg. After his Gymnasium he spent time at the Helgoland bird observatory and later worked on bird migration in the North Sea. He went to study at the University of Göttingen in 1931 and then transferred to Berlin. Between studies he worked at the Rossitten observatory. In 1936 he worked along with Oskar Heinroth and Helmut Sick to produce a vinyl record of bird songs. He completed his doctoral dissertation under Erwin Stresemann in 1937 on the systematics of the Galbulidae and the Bucconidae. He spent some years working at the Berlin Zoo.
In 1940 he replaced Gunther Niethammer, who had moved to Vienna, as head of the ornithological department at the Alexander Koenig Museum in Bonn. After Niethammer's return after the Second World War, Steinbacher moved to the Senckenberg Museum where he became curator in 1954.
Steinbacher published a popular book on bird migration "Vogelzug und Vogelzugforschung" in 1951 that was translated without his permission into Chinese by Cheng Tso-hsin. A similar Russian translation was also produced.
Steinbacher was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1992. He was also made an honorary inspector for nature conservation in Romania in 1965.
Retiring in 1976 he continued to edit the periodical "Gefiederte Welt" which he had begun to edit from 1938 when he became proficient with captive birds at the Berlin Zoo. He was also a coeditor for the bird volumes of Grzimek's Animal Encyclopaedia.
Steinbacher married Elfriede Hecke in 1940 and they had no children. She died in 1990. Steinbacher died in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe on 31 July 2005.

Kokanee salmon

The kokanee salmon ("Oncorhynchus nerka"), also known as the kokanee trout, little redfish, silver trout, kikanning, Kennerly's salmon, Kennerly's trout, or Walla, is the non-anadromous form of the sockeye salmon (meaning that they do not migrate to the sea, instead living out their entire lives in freshwater). There is some debate as to whether the kokanee and its sea-going relative are separate species; geographic isolation, failure to interbreed, and genetic distinction point toward a recent divergence in the history of the two groups. The divergence most likely occurred around 15,000 years ago when a large ice melt created a series of freshwater lakes and rivers across the northern part of North America. While some members of the salmon and trout family (salmonids) went out to sea (anadromous), others stayed behind in fresh water (non-anadromous). The separation of the sockeye and the kokanee created a unique example of sympatric speciation that is relatively new in evolutionary terms. While they occupy the same areas and habitats during the breeding season, when ocean-going sockeye salmon return to freshwater to spawn, the two populations do not mate with each other in some regions, suggesting speciation.
Distribution.
Kokanee are native to many lakes in the western United States and Canada including Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho in the United States and British Columbia and Yukon in Canada. Populations of kokanee are also found in Japan and Russia. Additionally, kokanee have been introduced to many other lakes in the United States including in those states mentioned above as well as in Montana, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico in the west, as well as in New England, New York and North Carolina in the east. Kokanee have also been introduced to lakes in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada.
Genetic and morphological diversity.
There is debate as to whether the kokanee has enough genetic distinction to be classified as a subspecies or a separate species from the sockeye salmon. Genetic evidence suggests that the evolution of landlocked sockeye has occurred more than once with different kokanee populations, showing genetic differences between populations. Most evidence points to events that land-locked the lake-type sockeye (which spawns in streams and lakes, rather than tributaries like the sea-type sockeye, but is still anadromous and spends most of its adult life out at sea), which evolved into the non-anadromous form. Genetic evidence from kokanee in the Fraser River drainage and Columbia River drainage shows that ancestors of the kokanee came from the lake-type sockeye. The data also suggests that the kokanee may have evolved back into a lake-type anadromous form at some point in recent history, although there is a lack of interbreeding between it and sockeye in the drainage systems. It is also important to note that genetic distinction between sockeye and kokanee that cohabitate varies from region to region, with some populations showing distinct divergence, but others showing very little divergence. Studies done in Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and Lake Sammamish in Washington State suggested that the genetic diversity between the lake-type sockeye and the kokanee marks the divergence of two species because cohabitating sockeye and kokanee did not interbreed, despite the fact that interbreeding was possible.
There is some morphological divergence between the kokanee and sockeye. The most noticeable difference is size. The kokanee is often smaller than the sockeye due to less nutrient availability in freshwater. Other morphological differences include higher gill raker counts in the kokanee, failure to develop the changes that allow the sockeye to transition between fresh and salt water, and juvenile kokanee's lower mean swim velocity compared to juvenile sockeye. Egg sizes are also a difference. Due to its size, the kokanee should theoretically have smaller eggs in order to increase fecundity. In reality, the kokanee egg size varies, even though the energetic cost of larger eggs can limit the fecundity of kokanee populations. Studies have found that kokanees can extract carotenoids (which provide red pigmentation during breeding) from food better than sockeyes due to sexual selection and mate choice. Again, the degree of morphological variation, such as gill raker count, can vary from population to population.
The Japanese kokanee, also known as the kunimasu salmon or black kokanee, is considered a subspecies of the sockeye salmon by some and occurs naturally in Lakes Akan and Chimikeppu on Hokkaido Island. The creation of a dam caused the extermination of the fish by changing the lake pH. As a result, the kokanee was believed to have gone extinct in the 1940s. In 2011 a few fish were found in an isolated lake on Mount Fuji. 
The Japanese kokanee varies from its sea-going sockeye relative in a few ways. The black kokanee breeds in March at a depth of 30–40 feet, while sockeye salmon breed in the fall and have a different number of gill rakers than the kokanee. In addition, the black kokanee is much darker in color than the sockeye or any other kokanee population. The fish has been introduced to different lakes around Japan for commercial fishing practices. It seems that commercial captive breeding programs, the introduction of non-native kokanee populations from Canada, and a population crash have decreased the genetic distinctiveness between the black kokanee and its sockeye relatives. These factors have also caused a decrease in native kokanee populations.
Identification, life cycle, and development.
While size range of kokanee is often lake-specific and depends on many factors, in typical populations the kokanee grows to an average size of with an average weight of . In bodies of water with more favorable conditions it can reach a size of up to and weigh . The largest kokanee, caught in Washington State, weighed . Adult kokanee can be found in open water where the thermocline is around . They can have anywhere between 29–40 gill rakers. As a fish that inhabits freshwater throughout their lifecycle they are often smaller than their sea-going sockeye relatives, due to less food availability. Size is the most significant morphological distinction between the kokanee and the sockeye, but gill raker count can differ from sockeye salmon as well. The main food source of this fish is plankton. “Kokanee have blue backs and silver sides and unlike other salmon and trout, except chum salmon, sockeye and kokanee lack distinct dark spots on their backs and tail fins. In addition, when compared to other trout, they have finer scales, larger eyes, and deeply forked tail”.
The typical life cycle of the kokanee is similar to that of other salmon. They are born in a stream and migrate down to a lake where they will spend most of their adult lives. Kokanee typically live for four years in a lake before heading back to spawning grounds to spawn and die. However, population longevity can vary between 2–7 years. A kokanee can spawn in a variety of different time periods called runs. Individual populations can have multiple runs associated with the kokanee in a lake and occur from August to February. Some kokanee have been seen spawning in April. The female kokanee creates a nest called a redd. She will lay around 1,000 eggs, depending on food availability. Eggs hatch within 110 days, and the juveniles swim out to the lake. 
During spawning, the males turn bright red and develop a humped back and an elongated jaw similar to the male sockeye salmon. Females also don a dark red hue during the breeding season, which also corresponds with the breeding season of sockeye salmon. 
Competition with introduced lake trout can lead to a decline in kokanee populations during the summer. Lake trout are predatory and will eat young kokanee. Predation by lake trout accounted for 83 percent of the 88 percent decline in kokanee populations in Lake Chelan, Washington. Other factors such as pollution, habitat loss, and warming global temperatures put the kokanee at risk in some areas.
Conservation.
Some kokanee populations have declined in the US and Canada, while others thrive. The kokanee's status is variable among different locations under the Endangered Species Act. They are listed as threatened in Ozette Lake in Washington State. Other kokanee populations in Washington State have shown genetic distinction, but attempts by the Lake Sammamish Kokanee Work Group to get the Lake Sammamish kokanee listed as a separate species and therefore endangered failed the US Fish and Wildlife criteria to be listed as a distinct species. The current IUCN red list standing of the kokanee is listed under the sockeye salmon ("Oncohynchus nerka") is of least concern. 
Even so, King County Washington in partnership with US Fish and Wildlife has issued conservation measures to save the fish that once numbered in the thousands. As few as 150 fish spawned in 2007–2008 marking a critical need for conservation of the state's kokanee population. Currently, restoration of streams, habitats, hatchery breeding, and a ban on fishing for kokanee has caused an increase in native kokanee populations. 
Lakes in Canada have also seen a decline in native kokanee, with numbers dropping from 2,800 fish to just 88 fish in 2007 in the Kluane National Park and Reserve. The park has outlawed fishing of kokanee, and it is illegal to possess a kokanee salmon. Conservation efforts have been largely successful with 4,660 kokanee spawning in the park in 2015. It is unclear as to why the kokanee population crashed in the mid and late 2000s.

Port Lincoln Times

The Port Lincoln Times is a newspaper published twice-weekly in Port Lincoln, South Australia. It was first printed in August 1927, and has been published continuously ever since. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. 
History.
The origins of the "Port Lincoln Times" began when the "Recorder" in Port Pirie was taken over by Mrs R.L. McGregor and her two sons. McGregor had worked under David Drysdale at the "Port Augusta Dispatch" and claims she was instrumental in suggesting that he start a newspaper in Port Lincoln. In 1925, she was approached by another former "Dispatch" employee, Maurice Hill, to sell the "Recorder", but she refused, and as a result, Hill, along with J.E. Edwards, founded the "Port Lincoln Times." 
The "Port Lincoln Times" was first published on 5 August 1927, and unlike many newspapers of the time, it did not continue or subsume a previous publication, and used a simple banner title without a definite article or sur- and sub-titles. On page 6 of the first issue, the new publication was introduced as both independent and non-sectarian, alongside an overall aim "to entertain and instruct by giving the whole of the news of the district which it serves, and to give it brightly, briefly, accurately and completely".
It absorbed the "West Coast Recorder" in 1942 as a result of wartime consolidations. In 1960, it also absorbed the "Areas Express" (17 September 1959 - 8 September 1960), which had been printed in Cleve. 
Since its founding, the company has been situated on the same site on Washington Street, Port Lincoln, since 1927. By the 1960s, the Hill family had modernised the look of the paper (with large front-page headlines, sport action photographs and large advertisements), and in 1990 the newspaper was taken over by Rural Press. Alongside many other rural publications in Australia (e.g. "Eyre Peninsula Tribune"), the newspaper was a member of Fairfax Media Limited, a national company which has been purchasing and rationalising publication assets across the country.
In addition, the newspaper also printed a short-lived free newspaper, the "Eyre Peninsula Rural Chronicle" (1987–1990), and a sister publication, the "Peninsula Farmer", in conjunction with the "West Coast Sentinel".
"West Coast Recorder".
The "West Coast Recorder" began printing in 1904 as the "Port Lincoln, Tumby and West Coast Recorder" which was shortened to the "West Coast Recorder" in 1909. The "Recorder", had absorbed the "Streaky Bay Standard and West Coast Advertiser" (1912), which was only issued twice by David Drysdale in early April that year, and quickly became a "Supplement to the West Coast recorder". It continued until it combined with the "Port Lincoln Times" in 1942. It was the first major newspaper established in Port Lincoln. The Port Lincoln History Group was raising funds in 2020 to work with the State Library of South Australia to digitise all editions of the newspaper and make them available on Trove.
Distribution.
The "Port Lincoln Times" is published on Tuesdays and Thursdays and is printed in Murray Bridge at the high-tech Rural Press printing centre. It serves the Lower Eyre Peninsula area, namely: Port Lincoln, Arno Bay, Cleve, Coffin Bay, Colton, Coomunga, Coulta, Cowell, Cummins, Darke Peak, Edillilie, Elliston, Karkoo, Kimba, Kyancutta, Lipson, Lock, Louth Bay, Mount Damper, Mount Hope, Mount Wedge, North Shields, Port Neill, Rudall, Sheringa, Talia, Tooligie, Tumby Bay, Ungarra, Wangary, Wanilla, Warramboo, Warrow, Wharminda, Wudinna, Yallunda Flat, and Yeelanna. The current monthly readership is estimated to be 19,000. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online.
Digitisation.
Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1927 to 1954, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service. In 2020 the Port Lincoln History Group was raising funds to also digitise the "West Coast Recorder".

Maria Hasse

Maria-Viktoria Hasse (May 30, 1921 – January 10, 2014) was a German mathematician who became the first female professor in the faculty of mathematics and science at TU Dresden. She wrote books on set theory and category theory, and is known as one of the namesakes of the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem in graph coloring.
Education and career.
Hasse was born in Warnemünde. She went to the gymnasium in Rostock, and after a term in the Reich Labour Service from 1939 to 1940, studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Rostock and University of Tübingen from 1940 to 1943, earning a diploma in 1943 from Rostock. She continued at Rostock as an assistant and lecturer, earning a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1949 and a habilitation in 1954. Her doctoral dissertation, "Über eine singuläre Intergralgleichung 1. Art mit logarithmischer Unstetigkeit" [On a singular integral equation of the 1st kind with logarithmic discontinuity], was supervised by Hans Schubert; her habilitation thesis was "Über eine Hillsche Differentialgleichung" [On Hill's differential equation]. She worked as a professor of algebra at TU Dresden from 1954 until her 1981 retirement.
Contributions.
With Lothar Michler, Hasse wrote "Theorie der Kategorien" [Category Theory] (Deutscher Verlag, 1966). She also wrote "Grundbegriffe der Mengenlehre und Logik" [Basic Concepts of Set Theory and Logic] (Harri Deutsch, 1968).
In the theory of graph coloring, the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem provides a duality between colorings of the vertices of a graph and orientations of its edges. It states that the minimum number of colors needed in a coloring equals the number of vertices in a longest path, in an orientation chosen to minimize the length of this path. It was stated in 1958 in a graph theory textbook by Claude Berge, and independently published by Hasse, Tibor Gallai, B. Roy, and L. Vitaver. Hasse's publication of this result was the second chronologically, in 1965.

Random Acts of Flyness

Random Acts of Flyness is an American late-night sketch comedy television series created by Terence Nance that premiered on August 4, 2018 on HBO. Additionally, Nance appears in each episode of the series which he also wrote, directed, and executive produced. On August 20, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season.
Premise.
"Random Acts of Flyness" is described as a "fluid, mind-melting stream-of-conscious response to the contemporary American mediascape" in which each episode will "feature interconnected vignettes that makes the series a unique mix of vérité documentary, musical performances, surrealist melodrama and humorous animation."
Production.
Development.
On January 29, 2018, it was announced that HBO had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of six episodes. The series was created by Terence Nance who will also write, direct, and executive produce. Producers are reportedly looking to cast a diverse group of performers with black actors eyed for many of the roles. Production companies involved in the series include MVMT.
On July 2, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on August 4, 2018. It was also reported that additional executive producers would include Tamir Muhammad, Jamund Washington, Kishori Rajan, Kelley Robins Hicks, Chanelle Aponte Pearson, Ravi Nandan, and John Hodges and that A24 had been added as an additional production company involved with the series. On August 20, 2018, it was announced that HBO had renewed the series for a second season.
Casting.
Alongside the announcement of the series premiere, it was confirmed that Terence Nance would appear in all six episodes of the first season with guests including Whoopi Goldberg, Dominique Fishback, Gillian Jacobs, Jon Hamm, Ntare Guma Mwine, Adepero Oduye, Natalie Paul, Lakeith Stanfield, Tonya Pinkins, and Paul Sparks.
Marketing.
On July 2, 2018, the first promo for the series was released.
Reception.
The series has been met with a positive response from critics since its premiere, and has gone on to win a 2018 Peabody Award. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 8.45 out of 10 based on 25 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Random Acts of Flyness" poignant political poetry plays in harmony with its frenetic absurdist humor to create a singular musical television experience." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 83 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
In a positive review, "The Los Angeles Times"s Robert Lloyd offered the series praise saying, "Its meanings are sometimes obscure and sometimes obvious, nearly to the point of being polemical, and most often somewhere in between. But its surfaces are always interesting and splendidly executed. Even the glitches are artfully placed." In a similarly positive critique, "The Hollywood Reporter"s Robyn Bahr described the series as "a beautiful sensory overload" and commended the series visual look saying, "the protean barrage of imagery and gonzo sound design overwhelms the senses. Once your brain gets used to its staccato rhythm, however, you settle in for the ride. Although I couldn't quite process all the nuances within the moment, I still found myself nodding along (and even dancing along) all the same." In another favorable assessment, "Variety"s Caroline Framke commended the series' various segments saying, "they all reveal incisive truths about what it means to be black in America — or actually, "reveal" isn’t quite the right word, and neither is "show." Instead "Acts of Flyness" wants to make its (white) audience feel what it means to be black in America."

Appleton City Hall

Appleton City Hall is a historic municipal building in Appleton, Minnesota, United States. It was built in 1895 as one of the few monumental 19th-century buildings in rural western Minnesota. It initially housed Appleton's government offices, fire department, and jail on the ground floor and an auditorium on the upper floor. The city hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for supposedly being an example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture and for its long service as a local government and community center. However other sources describe the building's style less specifically as Romanesque Revival, and its municipal services relocated to other facilities in 1976.

Ghostlore

Ghostlore or ghost-lore is a genre of folklore concerning ghosts. Ghostlore occurs throughout recorded history, including contemporary contexts. For example, American folklorist Louis C. Jones observes the following in 1944:
Ghostlore is still widespread and popular. While most of the actions thought to be common among ghosts (chain clanking, cemetery haunting, and so forth) can be found, they are by no means so widespread in the popular ghostlore as we have been led to expect. The ghost who is very like the living is far more common than any other. ... It might be expected that a rational age of science would destroy belief in the ability of the dead to return. I think it works the other way: in an age of scientific miracles anything seems possible.
The architecture of many older buildings on college campuses resembles that of buildings described in nineteenth century literary ghost stories and Gothic novels. Often these buildings become the setting for ghostly legends. According to professor Elizabeth Tucker, "By telling ghost stories, students transform their college buildings into mysterious and magical places..." The stories serve to "initiate entering students into a new community."

It owns 29 casinos, hotels, and racetracks and 4 golf courses throughout the United States.
History.
Vici Properties was formed as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (CEOC), the largest division of Caesars Entertainment. After placing CEOC into bankruptcy in January 2015, Caesars proposed splitting CEOC into two companies: a REIT, which would own the company's casinos, and an operating company, which would manage them. The plan was designed to maximize value for CEOC's creditors by taking advantage of favorable tax treatment for REITs. Several members of Congress opposed the plan, calling it an abuse of the REIT laws. They asked the Internal Revenue Service to deny tax-free status to the spin-off, but their protest went unheeded.
The spin-off of Vici to CEOC's creditors was completed on October 6, 2017, the day that CEOC emerged from bankruptcy. Vici began with a portfolio of nineteen casinos and racetracks, all leased to Caesars at a total initial annual rent of $630 million, and four golf courses. The company's name was adopted from the phrase "Veni, vidi, vici," commonly attributed to Julius Caesar.
Vici acquired Harrah's Las Vegas from Caesars in December 2017 for $1.1 billion, and leased it back at an initial annual rent of $87.4 million.
MGM Growth Properties, a REIT affiliated with Caesars competitor MGM Resorts International, offered in January 2018 to acquire Vici for an estimated $5.9 billion. Vici's board rejected the offer, deciding instead to proceed with a planned initial public offering. Vici completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in February 2018, raising $1.2 billion.
The company moved its headquarters to New York City from the Las Vegas area in mid-2018.
Vici completed two transactions with Caesars in 2018, purchasing the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace for $508 million and Harrah's Philadelphia for $242 million, and leasing them back to Caesars for $35 million and $21 million per year, respectively.
In 2019, Vici made two purchases in conjunction with Penn National Gaming. Vici bought the real estate of the Margaritaville Resort Casino in Louisiana and Greektown Casino–Hotel in Detroit for $261 million and $700 million, respectively, while Penn bought both properties' operating businesses and leased them from Vici for annual rent of $23 million and $56 million, respectively. Vici bought a second casino from Greektown seller Jack Entertainment, Jack Cincinnati Casino, in September 2019, paying $558 million for the real estate; Hard Rock International leased the property for $43 million per year.
In December 2019, Vici bought three casinos in Missouri and West Virginia from Eldorado Resorts in conjunction with Century Casinos: Isle Casino Cape Girardeau, Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville, and Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort. Vici paid $278 million for the real estate assets, and leased them to Century for $25 million per year. A month later, the company bought two more properties from Jack Entertainment, Jack Cleveland Casino and Jack Thistledown Racino, for a total of $843 million, leasing them back for $66 million per year.
In July 2020, Eldorado Resorts acquired Caesars Entertainment, becoming Vici's primary tenant, and renamed itself to Caesars Entertainment. In connection with this acquisition, Vici bought three properties (Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin, and Harrah's New Orleans) from Caesars for a total of $1.8 billion, and leased them back to the new Caesars for $154 million per year.
In March 2021, Vici agreed to purchase the real estate of the Venetian complex on the Las Vegas Strip from Las Vegas Sands for $4 billion. The sale includes the Venetian and Palazzo casino hotels and the Sands Expo convention center. Apollo Global Management would acquire the operating business and lease the property from Vici for $250 million per year.
In August 2021, Vici agreed to acquire MGM Growth Properties for $17.2 billion (including $5.7 billion in assumed debt). The purchase would add full ownership of thirteen properties to Vici's portfolio, and half ownership of the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay resorts, and would increase Vici's annual revenue by $1 billion, along with making it the largest land owner on the Las Vegas Strip owning over 660 acres. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2022.

Honor (The Walking Dead)

"Honor" is the ninth episode and mid-season premiere of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on February 25, 2018. The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Greg Nicotero.
The episode is the final regular appearance of Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes, who had been on the series since the first season. It also marks the departure of actor Jayson Warner Smith as Gavin, who had been part of the recurring cast since the previous season; his character is killed by Henry (Macsen Lintz).
Plot.
Following Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and the Saviors' assault on the communities of Alexandria, the Kingdom and the Hilltop convoy, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies deal with the aftermath of events. In a flashback, Carl (Chandler Riggs), having been bitten by a walker while trying to bring Siddiq (Avi Nash) to Alexandria, keeps his bite mark hidden, makes sure Siddiq finds quarters in the sewers below the community, spends time with his toddler sister Judith, and writes several letters to those he knows.
In the Kingdom, Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith) and the other Saviors of his group keep watch over Ezekiel (Khary Payton). Outside the community, Carol (Melissa McBride) leads the Kingdom survivors far enough away and instructs them to continue towards the house she used outside of the Kingdom for shelter, while she goes back to rescue Ezekiel. Henry (Macsen Lintz), who is trained in both firearm and melee combat, and whose older brother Benjamin had been killed by Jared, a Savior, insists that he come along to assist, but Carol orders him to stay with the others.
Afterwards, Carol meets up with Morgan (Lennie James), who had escaped the Saviors' massacre of Rick's snipers watching the Sanctuary. However, Morgan has become bitter and once the two are inside the Kingdom, he becomes brutal in dispatching the Saviors. At one point during the mission, Morgan disembowels a Savior as Carol and a rescued Ezekiel watch. Gavin, the last Savior of the group left alive, flees and attempts to hide, but Morgan easily finds him. Morgan prepares to kill Gavin, but Carol senses that Morgan is conflicted and attempts to convince him to spare Gavin. A distressed Morgan balks, trying to decide what to do, when suddenly Gavin is stabbed through the neck from behind by Henry, who had followed Carol and is seeking revenge for the murder of his brother.
In the present, after Negan's attack, Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) regroup with all the other Alexandria survivors in the storm sewers and come to learn of Carl's impending death. They decide to wait until Negan's assault is over and then head off to the Hilltop to regroup. Rick knows Carl will not survive the journey, and he and Michonne remain with Carl. Before leading the rest away, Daryl (Norman Reedus) commends Carl on their survival due to Carl's intent to stay out of the war with the Saviors and the preparations he had made. Carl and Rick spend much time discussing the past; Carl explains why he brought Siddiq here, and how he felt remorse for having killed a youth back during their time at the prison; Rick forgives him for these past transgressions.
As Rick and Michonne move Carl up to the church, Carl insists that Rick can become a better person; in his mind (shown in a dream sequence first seen in "Mercy"), Carl imagined his father in the future had become compassionate rather than vengeful, and devoted his time to raising their family and leading the Alexandria community. All survivors, including Negan, work together harmoniously to make Alexandria a thriving community in this dream. The next morning, a near-death Carl sends Rick and Michonne out of the church, and shoots himself rather than force them to have to do it once he dies; Rick and Michonne prepare a burial site to lay Carl to rest.
Development.
The ending of the episode intersects between Carl saying his goodbyes to Rick and Michonne, and Morgan's struggle to kill Gavin with Carol and Ezekiel attempting to talk him down. Director Greg Nicotero saw these scenes in direct contrast with each other, spending more time planning out how these two scenes would be merged. Nicotero saw Carl and Morgan's struggles mirroring each other, and had shot Carl's scenes with him on one side of the frame, and Morgan's on the other, to represent this mirroring.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The episode received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 80% with an average rating of 7.50 out of 10, based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus reads: "Focusing on the farewell of one of the series' original characters, "Honor" delivers an emotional mid-season premiere."
Ratings.
The mid-season premiere drew a total viewership of 8.28 million with a 3.6 rating in adults aged 18–49. This was an increase in viewership from the mid-season finale, which had 7.89 million viewers.

2016 and 2018 Philippine Olympic Committee elections

In November 2016, the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) held an elections which saw Jose "Peping" Cojuangco win a fourth term as president unopposed after Victorico "Ricky" Vargas was disqualified for not being an "active member" of the committee. Tolentino, a candidate for the chairman position was also disqualified under the same grounds.
The camp of Vargas said that being an active member does not equate to physical attendance which the POC led by then incumbent President Cojuangco insists. This led to Vargas to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the 2016 elections and rule on the POC's commission on election's authority to define the eligibility criteria of being an active member.
The court denied postponing the 2016 elections but it ruled in December 2017 that the commission on elections of the POC cannot qualify or restrict the criteria of being an active member, ruled that the results of the 2016 elections for the post of President and Chairman null and void, and ordered the POC to hold elections on February 23, 2018 with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates.
Cojuangco's camp has raised concerns on infringement on the POC's autonomy by the government and possible suspension of the POC by the International Olympic Committee leading to the 2018 elections. An extraordinary general assembly was held on February 19, 2018 to decide whether the elections should take place and discuss the active member eligibility. They affirmed the definition of the eligibility criteria that led to Vargas and Tolentino's disqualification in 2016 but the two were allowed to participate in the 2018 elections.
Vargas and Tolentino were then elected as president as Chairman respectively.
2016 elections.
Background.
Candidacy of Vargas and Tolentino.
Ricky Vargas made an attempt to run for President of the Philippine Olympic Committee in 2016 challenging incumbent, Peping Cojuangco. His camp includes Abraham Tolentino of Cycling running for chairman, Albee Benitez (Badminton) for First Vice President,
Lucas Managuelod (Muay Thai) for Second Vice President, Sonny Barrios (Basketball) for Treasurer, and Ting Ledesma (Table Tennis) for Auditor.
Mariano Araneta of the Philippine Football Federation also planned to run for President of the POC but withdrew to support Vargas' candidacy.
Disqualification of Vargas and Tolentino.
The candidacy of Vargas and Tolentino were not accepted by the POC's commission on elections which is headed by Francisco Elizalde. Elizalde reasoned that the two did not satisfy article 7 section 11 of the POC charter which stated that a candidate must have attended 50 percent plus one of the total number of General Assemblies the past two years.
Ricky Vargas criticized his disqualification through his spokesperson Chito Salud. The Vargas camp alleged that the disqualification decision was made "without any objection or opposition from a known third party", "hastily rendered" without a basic requisite hearing held and there was no written resolution issued in regards to the justification to disqualify him.
According to Elizalde, Vargas is an inactive member for attending just one general assembly meeting within the past two years. Vargas insist that being an active member is "more than attendance" and that "Physical presence at the general assembly does not equate to active participation". Then incumbent president, Peping Cojuangco insists there is nothing political about the rules on elections set by the POC in 2008 are just being followed. Vargas then filed a petition for temporary restraining order (TRO) before the Pasig Regional Trial Court to stop the scheduled November 25 elections to allow for dialogue.
The Senate's committee on sports held a hearing on November 22 regarding alleged unliquidated funds given to the sports body by the government and the contentious disqualification of Vargas. The POC made an unsuccessful request to have the hearing cancelled. Its lawyers attended the oral hearings since the POC stated that President Peping Cojuangco had to attend to a hearing regarding the TRO petition filed by Vargas' camp. However Cojuangco did not attend the TRO hearing. The Philippine Sports Committee also attempted to hold a mediation meeting but Cojuangco or his allies did not attend to the meeting.
The Pasig RTC denied Vargas' camp to have the elections stopped but hearings regarding the "active member" criteria which led to Vargas' disqualification was scheduled to take place in December 2016.
Disqualification of Tom Carrasco.
Tom Carrasco, the then-incumbent chairman vied for a reelection although he was later disqualified due to not being an incumbent member of a president of a member NSA at that time anymore. He was previously president of the Triathlon Association of the Philippines.
Elections and results.
The elections was held at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club in Mandaluyong on November 25, 2016 during the POC's general assembly.
37 voting members were present with six members including disqualified Ricky Vargas absent from the meeting. Incumbent President Jose Cojuangco Jr., and an aspiring auditor, Jonne Go ran unopposed.
There were no candidates for the position of chairman due to previous incumbent chairman, Tom Carrasco ruled ineligible for reelection and the rejection of the candidacy of Abraham Tolentino.
2018 elections.
Background.
Pasig RTC ruling.
Branch 155 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig ruled that the results of the 2016 elections for the post of President and Chairman of the Philippine Olympic Committee as null and void. The decision penned on December 1, 2017 by Judge Maria Gracia A. Cadiz-Casaclang stated that the "POC Election Committee acted beyond the scope of its power and authority granted to it by the POC Executive Board, and had violated its own POC Election rule" when the election body "motu proprio" disqualified Ricky Vargas and Abraham Tolentino as candidates of the 2016 elections. It added that the election committee cannot restrict or qualify the criteria of being an "active member" of the POC as equating to "physical presence in the meetings of the General Assembly". The court ordered the POC to hold elections for the post of President and Chairman with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates. The Vargas camp hailed the decision.
POC Court of Appeals TRO petition.
The POC filed a temporary restraining order against the Pasig court's ruling but the Court of Appeals ruled against giving a TRO. During the January 31, 2018 meeting of the General Assembly, Ricky Vargas' camp was unsuccessful in starting a discussion regarding the February elections ordered by the Pasig court after Peping Cojuangco adjourned the meeting. POC spokesperson Prospero Pichay stated that such discussion is premature since reasoning that sports body has yet to receive the Court of Appeals ruling denying the POC a TRO. Ed Picson executive director of Vargas' NSA, Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines disputes the claim. Vargas' camp has accused Cojuangco of delaying the February elections.
February 2018 pre-election events.
The POC notified the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through a February 8 memorandum that it plans to hold elections on February 23, 2018.
Pere Miro, IOC deputy director general, expressed in a February 9 letter that fact the POC's internal dispute was referred to an "ordinary court" as "unfortunate". He said that internal disputes in a National Olympic Committee, such as the POC, must have been resolved by its competent governing bodies including its General Assembly. Though he insists that the letter is not meant as an interference by the IOC of the judicial courts of the Philippine government.
It also informed the international Olympic body that it plans to hold an Extraordinary General Assembly on February 19 where it plans to discuss Miro's letter, elections eligibility criteria, and other matters. POC spokesperson, Prospery Pichay latter clarified on February 14 that the notice was a matter of "matter of compliance" to avoid the POC to be cited for contempt and the planned extraordinary meeting will discuss whether to hold the election or not noting that Miro's letter did not direct for the holding of an election.
The POC through Pichay said that the national sports body is concerned of a possible suspension by the IOC and said that the IOC's letter of resolving internal disputes by the General Assembly rather than external courts is the POC's "guiding principle" for its extraordinary general assembly.
Vargas' camp has claimed the support of 27 NSAs and said that they will fight for Vargas and Tolentino's eligibility in the general assembly.
2018 February POC Extraordinary General Assembly.
The extraordinary meeting held as scheduled at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club. Ramon Fernandez, Charles Maxey, Arnold Agustin and Celia Kiram of the Philippine Sports Commission sought entry but was denied. The POC through Pichay reasoned that the move was to protect the body's "integrity and autonomy". The four PSC officials interpreted that they should have been part of the meeting saying that Miro's letter called for dialogue between "all interested parties". Due to technical reasons, officials of the weightlifting and shooting national sports associations were also barred from attending the meeting.
Pichay said that the General Assembly agreed to hold elections on February 23 and insists the move was not due to the Pasig court order. The assembly upheld the definition of the eligibility criteria of being an "active member" which led to the disqualification of Vargas and Tolentino in the 2016 elections. Pichay said it is clear that being an active member in the POC means physical attendance and that refers to the person rather than their NSA. An election committee has been formed which was headed by Francisco Elizalde, who led the commission on elections that disqualified Vargas in 2016.
Vargas and Tolentino speculated that they will be disqualified from the February 2018 elections though they said they will attend the elections. However they were allowed to run for the elections this time. The Elizalde-led commissions on election made the decision to allow the candidacy to two with the Pasig court order partially nullifying the 2016 elections in consideration. Elizalde maintained that he personally still consider the two as ineligible but has stated that he doesn't want to be cited contempt of court.
Then incumbent President Peping Cojuangco expressed disappointment of the move. He said that to allow an election to adhere to a court order is tantamount to government intervention. Cojuangco said he will inform the IOC regarding the development.
Elections and results.
Elections took place at the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club in Mandaluyong on February 23, 2018. The positions of President and Chairman was contested. Ricky Vargas was elected president after he won over incumbent Peping Cojuangco with 24 votes going to the former, and 15 voters for the latter. One vote was an abstention. Abraham Tolentino secured a 23–15 win over Ting Ledesma.
Aside from the presidents of POC's member NSAs, athletes representatives track and field athlete Henry Dagmil and weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, as well the Philippine permanent representative to the IOC and Peping Cojuangco's daughter, Imee Cojuangco-Jaworski, was among those who voted in the polls. There were a total of 43 voting members present but only 40 voted in the elections. Albee Benitez, head of the badminton NSA arrived late and was not able to vote. Due to technicalities, Shooting holdover president Richard Fernandez and weightlifting chief Monico Puentevella were barred from voting.
According to journalist Al Mendoza, Joey Romasanta abstained from voting for a president but managed to get Pete Cayco (acting volleyball president), Jonne Go (canoe-kayak) and Jeff Tamayo (soft tennis) to vote for Vargas.
Aftermath.
Reactions.
Following the conclusion of the 2018 elections, Vargas, who claims to be inexperienced in elections and politics, was elated and Cojuangco left the venue telling the media that he would be calling for a meeting.
Peping Cojuangco then conceded defeat the following day saying that the "majority has spoken". and said he wants to know what his future role in the POC would be.
He also said that since the beginning he would like to be certain on "how far the courts can go" and expressed belief that the interpretation of the POC's bylaws and interpretation shouldn't be made by one person though he mentions he could have possibly allow the Supreme Court to get involved. Cojuangco also said that he was obliged to protect the POC's autonomy and protect it from religious, monetary and political pressures. He also raised concerns on how the POC deals with a hypothetical scenario where a government court orders the replacement of a particular athlete in a Philippine delegation for an international competition in lieu of an athlete the court declares as undeserving. Despite the end of his presidency, Cojuangco has vowed to remain an "active member" of the national olympic committee.
POC Commission on Elections head, Francisco Elizalde revealed that he allowed Vargas and Tolentino to run in the 2018 elections after consulting with IOC officials in South Korea during the Winter Olympics and added that the IOC "was very much aware of the situation in the Philippines". He said while the IOC regretted the situation, it allowed the POC to go ahead with the election and that the international body didn't object to the manner the elections took place. However he expressed pessimism that a "healing"
will take place in Philippine sports noting "not friendly relations among a lot of people" in the POC.
The petition filed by Cojuangco camp to disallow Vargas and Tolentino's candidacy for the February 2018 election was dismissed by the 10th Division of the Court of Appeals on July 10, 2018. It declared the petition as "moot and academic" since the petitioners decided to hold the election and recognize Vargas and Tolentino as winners of the said election.
Transition.
Shortly after Vargas' election as POC President, a transition team consisting of Karen Tanchanco, football general secretary Edwin Gastanes and basketball legal counsel Edgardo Francisco was formed to "ensure a smooth transition of the POC’s files, records and properties".
Vargas decided to retain Julian Camacho as chef de mission of the Philippine delegation to the 2018 Asian Games. Monsour del Rosario, Jonnee Go, and Joey Romasanta remains chef de mission of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, 2010 Youth Summer Olympics, and 2020 Summer Olympics respectively. Camacho later resigned from his post.
Businessman and sports patron Manny Pangilinan has provided as seed money to the POC. Cecilio Pedro of Hanabishi and Lamoiyan, and Alfrancis Chua sports head of San Miguel Corporation has also pledged support. Vargas said that they will form a "NSA-type" committee to deal with the issue regarding the POC's alleged unliquidated funds provided by the Philippine Sports Commission for its NSAs.
To cool-off hostilities Vargas has expressed writing off debts of the NSA as a possible option.
Vargas and Tolentino were sworn in before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in a simple ceremony at the Malacañang Palace on 5 March 2018 which marked the official start of their terms.

Reception.
Critical response.
The series has been met with a mixed to positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 71% approval rating with an average rating of 5.51/10 based on 34 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Dirty John" might not live up to the thrills of its source material, but Connie Britton puts on a clinic with her interpretation of true crime treachery." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 58 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."
In a positive review, "Entertainment Weekly"s Kristen Baldwin gave the first season a grade of "A-" and directed particular praise at the performances in it describing Britton as "perfectly cast" and saying of Bana that he "may benefit the most from "Dirty John"; as Meehan, the actor pivots from charming to chilling and back again with astonishing ease." In a similarly favorable analysis, the "Los Angeles Times"s Mike Mack commended the first season declaring, "Glossy and well-acted, its transfer from your daily commute's most suspenseful listening stretch ever to serviceable wine-and-laundry-folding companion show feels, all in all, a smooth one."
In a more mixed assessment, "RogerEbert.com"s Brian Tallerico gave the first season qualified praise saying, ""Dirty John" is very entertaining, though it's not without faults. It doesn't dig very deep, or present Debra's daughters as full characters (their main roles are to look confused or upset, which is a waste of big talent), and its storytelling can be a little convoluted. But it never claims to be high art." In an outright negative appraisal, "TVLine"s Dave Nemetz gave the first season a grade of "D" and criticized it saying, "Britton and her talented co-stars are wasted here on a warmed-over Lifetime movie masquerading as a prestige TV miniseries — one that's, sadly, not even trashy enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure." In another unfavorable evaluation, "IndieWire"s Ben Travers was very critical of the series' first season giving it a grade of "C-" and saying that, "Decidedly not ambitious 'prestige' television, the first three episodes make perfectly clear this isn't a nuanced series, or one interested in exploring abuse or manipulation in serious fashion. It's trying to be a juicy nighttime soap that uses the 'true story' tag to drive viewers' mouths further and further agape."
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.15/10 for the second season. The website's critics consensus states, "Although "The Betty Broderick Story" sensational story is at times scattershot, Amanda Peet's incredible embodiment of a woman scorned is a sight to behold." Metacritic gave the second season a score of 73 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."

Take Aim (Harold Land album)

Take Aim is a studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land. The album was recorded in Los Angeles in 1960 but released only in 1980 via Blue Note label. This rare record was re-released on CD in 2005 and 2012.
Reception.
George Harris of All About Jazz stated ""Take Aim" has all of the features of classic hard bop: tight ensemble work, creative and hard-driving solos, and crisp rhythm work. It makes you wonder where Leon Pettis has been all these years. At times, the drummer sounds like thunder from on high as he pushes this band. Martin Banks is articulate and has that Brownie quality in his trumpet solos. Of course, Land, with an immediately identifiable rough yet light sound, is the epitome of hard bop. His music sounds as fresh today as the moment it was recorded over forty years ago."
Scott Yanow of Allmusic wrote "This little-known Blue Note session by tenor saxophonist Harold Land went unreleased until this 1980 LP. Land and an obscure supporting cast (trumpeter Martin Banks, pianist Amos Trice, bassist Clarence Jones, and drummer Leon Pettis) perform five hard bop originals and a lyrical "You're My Thrill." The performances, which are now hard to find, should interest Land collectors and fans of the era's modern mainstream jazz, although overall the results are not that memorable."

Genius (2018 Hindi film)

Genius is a 2018 Indian Hindustani-language action thriller film directed by Anil Sharma. It marks the debut of his son Utkarsh Sharma as a male lead, who also featured as a child actor in Sharma's 2001 film "" and Ishita Chauhan. Veteran actress Ayesha Jhulka, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Mithun Chakraborty and Malti Chahar are in supporting roles in the film.
Plot.
The film starts with Vasudev Shastri, a genius RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agent, being labelled as incompetent because he had failed in an important mission and got himself too injured to work again. Later, when he sits by a park depressed, Nandini, the love of his life, consoles him. The film then goes into a flashback where Vasudev Shastri (Utkarsh Sharma) who is a topper yet charming man who comes to IIT where the second ranker, Nandini Chauhan (Ishitha Chauhan), out of jealousy, decides to make his life hell. She constantly detests him, but Vasu (Vasudev Shastri) outsmarts her every time. Besides being the friendly "genius" around campus, he secretly does a part-time job with RAW, where his hacking talents are occupied. The day before the final exam in IIT, Nandini reluctantly visits Vasu to get help regarding a theorem. There, Vasu admits to Nandini that he had been long in love with her. Hearing this, Nandini immediately hatches a cunning plan and gives Vasu sleeping pills so that he is unable to attend the exam the next day. However, Vasu outsmarts her this time as well and reaches the exam hall before her. Vasu doesn't at all seem angry with her and instead helps her with an unexpected glitch and walks away smiling after completing his paper. On the day of the results, Nandini comes to know that Vasu had intentionally submitted a blank paper just to let her top. Seeing his dedication towards love, Nandini madly falls in love with him but doesn't reveal it and flies off to the US for her dream job. On the other hand, Senior members of RAW, impressed by Vasu's intelligence, try to convince him to join RAW. After learning that his parents were killed in communal riots planned by ISI of Pakistan, Vasu finally decides to join RAW to take revenge against ISI. The film returns to the present, where Vasu, who is labelled incompetent by RAW, uses a walking stick and suffers from acute tinnitus and several injuries since his failed mission. Nandini had taken a break from her job to return to India and take care of Vasu. She takes Vasu to her house in Puducherry, where her mother is pleasantly surprised to see Nandini (who had never valued personal relationships before her career) make huge sacrifices for Vasu's welfare. Vasu and Nandini spend some romantic moments, but their happiness is short lived as Vasu starts having hallucinations about his failed mission. A confused Nandini tries to take Vasu to the USA for treatment. Vasu refuses and narrates the tragic story of his failed mission to Nandini, after which he leaves to track MRS (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), the mastermind of ISI in India and the prime target of his failed mission. Soon after, it is shown that all the hallucinations were just a drama set up by Vasu to track his enemies. He, one by one, kills everyone who had helped MRS. On the other hand, MRS senses Vasudev's return and plans to kill him in a masquerade party. In the masquerade party, Vasu saves himself but gets injured once again. Seeing Vasu's miserable condition, Nandini breaks down. MRS, who was secretly observing them, takes advantage of this and kidnaps Nandini. Soon after, the senior members of RAW
acknowledge his competence. With the help of RAW, Vasu finds Nandini, saves Mathura from a huge blast and finally kills MRS by drowning him in the river. All members of RAW praise him. The film ends with him sharing a big hug with Nandini.

Wide Awake!

Wide Awake! (stylized as WIDE AWAAAAAKE!) is the sixth studio album by American indie rock band Parquet Courts, released on May 18, 2018 on Rough Trade Records.
The album was preceded by the singles "Almost Had to Start a Fight/In and Out of Patience", "Wide Awake", and "Mardi Gras Beads", and succeeded by the single "Total Football".
Background.
The album was first announced in February 2018, while the album was recorded in December 2017 to January 2018. The band recruited Danger Mouse to produce the album, as the band claimed, as a way to push themselves outside of their comfort zone. On recruiting Danger Mouse for the album, Andrew Savage said, "I personally liked the fact that I was writing a record that indebted to punk and funk, and Brian’s a pop producer who’s made some very polished records. I liked that it didn’t make sense."
In an interview with "Billboard", Andrew Savage described the album having a funk influence saying, "there's this duality between joy and anger that I find to be really interesting, and that's something the record kind of deals with at large. I always thought it was really interesting how hardcore could be such an angry music form but could make you feel so positive. There's a lot of moments on the record when all of us are singing at the same time and I guess that's something I kind of associate with hardcore, or Funkadelic."
Critical reception.
"Wide Awake!" received critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 28 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". In a five-star review, Emma Swan of "DIY" called the album, "a gut-punch of an immediate classic". Writing for "Exclaim!" magazine, Vish Kanna said that "Wide Awake!" "is a letter-perfect musical contemplation of modern times, where social uprisings are actually affecting positive change. It's urgent and potent music that's thought-provoking and danceable, and whose rage is measured by a pointed optimism." Roy Trakin, in a rave review for "Variety", praised the album for its social conscience in its day and age, stating it "may be the most woke punk-rock record since the heyday of the Clash."
In a more mixed review, Chris Nelson of "Mojo" wrote that "unsurprisingly, it flies the Wire and Minutemen flags high. More surprising are the occasional nods to funk and '60s bubblegum."
"Wide Awake!" was named 'album of the year' in an end-of-year list by Australian radio station "Double J" and the second-best album of 2018 by Paste.

Rhynchodes ursus

Rhynchodes ursus, or elephant weevil, is a wood-boring weevil found all over New Zealand. Adult weevils are found on trees, where they gather to feed on sap. Larvae tunnel into dead trunks and branches of southern beeches, rimu and Dracophyllum traversii.
This large weevil has a deep brown colour with two lighter bands near the side of its thorax. It has black legs with a spot of yellowish-brown hairs on each femur. It has dense scales on its body, which can be hair-like. In female specimens the antennae are inserted halfway along the rostrum and nearer the front in males. The larvae of "Rhynchodes ursus" are the host of New Zealand's largest parasitic wasp, "Certonotus fractinervis". Female wasps use a long ovipositor to lay eggs inside the larvae whilst they develop inside trees.

Aquarius Dignitus

The MV Aquarius Dignitus, formerly Aquarius 2 and Aquarius, is a 1977-built dual-flagged (Germany and Panama) search and rescue vessel, which has been used to rescue refugees and illegal migrants stranded in the Mediterranean Sea since 2016. It has been chartered and operated since February 2016 by the NGOs SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or Doctors without borders) as a rescue vessel for migrants and refugees making the Mediterranean crossing in makeshift craft from Libya to Italy as part of the European migrant crisis.
The vessel is a converted German coast-guard and fishery protection vessel (then named Meerkatze, built in 1977). The ship has a registered capacity to accommodate 25 crew members and usually carries 4 journalists and can carry up to 300 rescued migrants. All of the refugees sleep on the deck, as the vessel does not have beds, cabins or accommodation for refugees. In November 2018, "The Guardian" reported that her flag had been revoked by Panama and Liberia, and there was a search for a prospective flag to register under.
History.
Completed by Lürssen in Bremen in 1977, serial ID 13453, the ship was utilised by the German Federal Agency for Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE) unit of the Küstenwache, or the German Federal Coast Guard, as a "Fischereischutzboot" or fishery protection vessel.
The ship was classified by Germanischer Lloyd as a Class E2 icebreaker, employed principally in the central North Sea and North Atlantic, where thanks to its design it proved excellent at navigating through adverse sea conditions. In 2009 it was decommissioned and replaced by the "Meerkatze II", previously the research ship "Anton Dohrn". It was acquired by Bremen company RS Research Shipping (now Jasmund Shipping), renamed MV "Aquarius" and re-registered under Gibraltar port of registry. Here it operated until the end of 2015 as a survey vessel for renewable energy, oil &amp; gas industry, and other offshore projects.
On 1 September 2018, the vessel's operators changed the ship's name from "Aquarius" to "Aquarius 2" and changed its vessel type from "research vessel" to "search and rescue vessel".
The ship has been operated and managed by Jasmund shipping GmBH since June 2017, and after a brief interval again since 11 September 2018. Prior to this, the ship was managed by Hempel shipping (2009–2017). The ship has been owned by Aquarius GmBH &amp; Co KG since April 2009. On 16 August 2018, the ship was inspected by the Port state control (Pais MoU) at Valletta (Malta) and five deficiencies were found related to the crew certificates, oil record book and blocked routes of escape.
Operations in Mediterranean Sea.
In February 2016 the ship was chartered by humanitarian NGO SOS Méditerranée, to provide open sea rescue and support to migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach the European Union. Operating on missions coordinated by Rome's maritime rescue coordination centre, patrolling the waters around Sicily, Lampedusa, and near the Libyan coast, it provided aid to over 10,000 migrants. On 25 May 2016 the "Aquarius" returned from its tenth rescue operation, having saved 388 migrants. A Ghanaian boy was born on board who was subsequently named Alex in honor of the Russian captain of the "Aquarius", Alexander Moroz.
In June 2018 the ship, carrying 629 migrants from Sudan and Bangladesh saved from the sea, was denied entry to Italy by its new Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and to Malta as well. The Government of Spain offered the ship the chance to dock in the port of Valencia, Spain, and the Italian Navy offered full assistance and a marine escort for the trip. "Aquarius" and its migrants arrived at the Port of Valencia on 17 June. Half of them opted to claim asylum in France, insofar as France opened the doors to anyone from the "Aquarius". In August 2018, Spain refused entry to the vessel carrying 141 migrants from Eritrea and Somalia as Spain is not the closest safe port, as stipulated by international law. They were distributed among France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain.
On 20 September 2018 the Aquarius picked up ten Pakistanis and a person from the Ivory Coast from a dinghy from the Libyan coast and from the closest European shore, the Italian island Lampedusa. The same day the Aquarius asked Italy and Malta permission to disembark the eleven migrants and both countries refused. The migrants were handed over to a coastguard vessel off Malta on 29 September 2018, after European governments had agreed to take the people in. The "Aquarius 2" returned to Marseille. In the autumn of 2018, the ship was repeatedly denied entry by Italy was instead forced to land in Malta and Spain. Italy had seen more than 700,000 migrants arrive on its shores in the 2013–2018 period. In December 2018, MSF and SOS Méditerranée announced that they had ceased their operations with the ship due repeated accusations of trafficking in waste and criminal activity, but affirmed their determination to "resume our activities".
Flag.
The vessel was flagged under the flag of convenience Gibraltar since February 2018. She was registered as a research and survey vessel, which subsequently led to administrative issues. On 6 August 2018 the Gibraltar Maritime Administration issued a "notice of removal" for the Aquarius, because she was registered as a survey vessel, but used as a rescue ship. As a result, the ship was warned that she would be removed from Gibraltar registry. Thence, the ship's operators approached other flags in order to register the ship under them. On 10 August 2018, they applied to register the ship with a Vatican-State flag, but this was denied by Vatican. On 27 August 2018 the ship arrived in Marseille and its operator MSF announced that the owner had applied for a registration of the vessel in the flag of convenience Panama on 20 August. However, on 22 September 2018 the maritime authority of Panama announced that it had initiated procedures to remove the Aquarius from its registry, quoting violations of international law with respect to migrants, rescue at sea and refusing to carry the migrants back to the area where they originated (UNCLOS, SOLAS and SAR convention). The Government of Panama initiated the process based on information received from Italy that the "Aquarius" had not followed international regulations and legal proceedings concerning the transport of migrants. Aquarius was specifically accused of not returning the rescued migrants to Libya as required by the SAR convention.
In September 2018, the vessel continued to be classed with Germanischer Lloyd and registered with Gibraltar flag as a research / survey vessel. This led to issues with authorities, as a research and survey vessel cannot operate as a passenger vessel unless it reflects these changes in its registry documents. After the ship returned to Marseille in early October 2018 the owner issued a statement about negotiating to obtain a new flag from Switzerland, Luxembourg or Venezuela. As per Equasis and IHS maritime, on 1 September 2018, the ship changed its name to "Aquarius 2" and changed its flag to Germany. As per Equasis and IHS maritime, on 1 November 2018, the ship changed its name to "Aquarius Dignitus" and changed its flag to Liberia.

He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Helsinki in 2003 and held a post-doc position from 2003 to 2007 at Stanford University in Irving Weissman’s lab.
Career.
Rossi was appointed Associate Professor at the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University. At the same time he was a principal faculty member of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an investigator at the Immune Disease Institute (IDI), as well as in the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the Children’s Hospital Boston.
Moderna was founded in 2010, based on discovery that pluripotent stem cells can be transformed and reprogrammed. "Time" magazine cited this pluripotent discovery as one of the top ten medical breakthroughs of the year. He was also named as one of "People Who Mattered" for "Time" in 2010. He was cited because the discovery "involved the invention of a safer method for creating pluripotent stem cells... a new method (which) could help move stem cell–based treatments for diseases such as diabetes and Parkinson’s more quickly from the lab to the clinic." Rossi was selected one of the 100 Most Influential People in 2011 by "Time".
In 2013 Rossi, Chien and their team reported that they "were able to improve heart function in mice and enhance their long-term survival with a "redirection of their [stem cell] differentiation toward cardiovascular cell types" in a significant step towards regenerative therapeutics for Moderna. In the same year and on the strength of the same paper Moderna was able to partner with AstraZeneca in exchange for $240 million "in upfront cash (plus much more in potential milestone payments)", and then received from other investors $110 million. 
In 2014 Rossi retired from his functions at the board and as a scientific advisor at Moderna.
In 2015 Rossi was scientific co-founder of Intellia Therapeutics, which uses CRISPR gene editing for developing new drugs for treating genetic diseases. In 2016 Rossi co-founded Magenta Therapeutics focussing on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in order to reset the patient’s immune system in case of autoimmune diseases, blood cancers and genetic diseases. Rossi was involved in the foundation of Stelexis Therapeutics, which develops new medication for treating cancerous stem cells. 
In 2018 Rossi retired from all of his Harvard positions in order to focus on his activities as an entrepreneur. Rossi currently serves as a board member of the New York Stem Cell Foundation. Rossi is now the CEO of Convelo Therapeutics.
Scientific contributions.
Rossi develops and promotes new therapies using biotechnological methods thus contributing to novel approaches in regenerative medicine. His research focussed on different aspects of stem cell biology. In order to avoid ethical issues related to the use and exploitation of human stem cells, Rossi based his developments on the results of Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman on mRNA. He succeeded in finding investors for his plans to transfer these findings into new medications and vaccinations by founding Moderna.
Rossi is on record as writing of his synthetic modified mRNA: "because our technology is RNA based, it completely eliminates the risk of genomic integration and insertional mutagenesis inherent to all DNA-based methodologies." The abstract from this paper which earned him recognition of "Time" reads in part: "Here we describe a simple, nonintegrating strategy for reprogramming cell fate based on administration of synthetic mRNA modified to overcome innate antiviral responses (in Murine embryos and human epidermis and human ESC-derived dH1f and MRC-5 fetal lung fibroblasts, Detroit 551 human fetal skin fibroblasts, BJ neonatal foreskin fibroblasts, and fibroblast-like cells cultured from a primary skin biopsy taken from an adult cystic fibrosis patient). We show that this approach can reprogram multiple human cell types to pluripotency with efficiencies that greatly surpass established protocols (for neuronal myocyte or cardiomyocyte targets). We further show that the same technology can be used to efficiently direct the differentiation of RNA-induced pluripotent stem cells (RiPSCs) into terminally differentiated myogenic cells. This technology represents a safe, efficient strategy for somatic cell reprogramming and directing cell fate that has broad applicability for basic research, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine."
In his 2010 paper, Rossi described his preference for "complexing the RNA with a cationic vehicle to facilitate uptake by endocytosis" instead of electroporation because "this would allow for repeated transfection to sustain ectopic protein expression over the days to weeks required for cellular reprogramming." Rossi and his team "treated synthesized RNA with a phosphatase" to overcome the interferon resistance pathway, and substituted "5-methylcytidine (5mC) for cytidine" and "pseudouridine for uridine". The team hit upon a "modified ribonucleotides and phosphatase treatment" (henceforth "mod-RNAs") and masked the mod-RNA past the interferon barrier through use of the vaccinia virus B18R protein, which served as inhibitor, but still the kinetics dictated a daily transfection treatment regime. Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was used because it had been reported to increase reprogramming efficiency. 
In 2021 he was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award in the category "Scientific Research".
Family life.
Rossi is married to Finnish biologist Nina Korsisaari and father of three daughters.

Rabocheye Delo

Rabocheye Delo (, "The Workers' Cause") was a non-periodical political newspaper and an organ of the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad. It ran from April 1899 to February 1902. The printing house was in Geneva and the editorial office was in Paris. Its editors were Boris Krichevsky, Pavel Teplov, Vladimir Ivanshin and, from 1900, Aleksandr S. Martynov. A total of 12 issues were published in nine volumes. The editorial board of "Rabocheye Delo" was the foreign center of the Economists.
The political trend of "Rabocheye Delo" was indicated in its first issue: the struggle for the economic interests of the proletariat was proclaimed the basis of all social-democratic activity, while the political tasks were presented as a matter of a distant future. Lenin in his book "What Is To Be Done?" characterised the position of "Rabocheye Delo" in the following way: 
At the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), "Rabocheye Delo" represented the extreme right wing of the party.
Precedents.
"Rabocheye Delo" was originally founded by the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, in late 1895. Its first issue was ready to go to press when it was seized by gendarmes during a raid on Anatoly Vaneyev's house. Although 6 League members, including Lenin, were arrested, work continued on the League.
In the second half of 1898, however, the League and "Rabocheye Delo" fell under control of the Economists through their paper, "Rabochaya Mysl" (, "Workers' Thought").
Supplement.
"Rabocheye Delo" had a supplement called "Listok "Rabochego Dela"" (, ""Rabocheye Delo"'s Paper") that ran for eight issues, from June 1900 to July 1901. It was edited in Geneva.

Nyasaland Famine 1949

The Nyasaland Famine 1949 was a famine that occurred in the Shire Highlands in the Southern Province of Nyasaland (now Malawi) and also in a part of the Central Province in 1949: its effects extended into the early part of 1950. The immediate cause was severe droughts in December 1948 to January 1949 and in March 1949 that destroyed much of the maize crop on which the people of the affected areas relied during its main growing season. This followed two years of erratic rainfall and poor harvests which had depleted the reserves in farmers’ granaries. The effect of crop failure was intensified by the failure of the colonial government to maintain a suitably large emergency grain reserve, delays in importing sufficient relief supplies and its requirement that most of the relief provided was paid for by its recipients. The official death toll from starvation was some 200 people, which may be an underestimate, and it excludes those dying of diseases exacerbated by malnutrition.
There is significant disagreement on the underlying causes of the famine. At first, it was blamed on over-intensive cultivation causing soil erosion and on growing tobacco rather than food crops. Later, colonial underdevelopment through land expropriation, levying rents and taxes on African farmers and underpaying them for their labour and produce was suggested. More recently, attention has been focussed to the uneven economic and social development of the protectorate in the 1930s and 1940s. This created, firstly, an increased number of employees and tradesmen, who needed to buy their food but who were dependent on the uncertain surpluses arising the system of subsistence agricultural because few farmers produced food primarily for the market rather than their own consumption, and governmental marketing organisations that, far from providing incentives for the production of maize, underpaid those farmers that did grow it commercially. In addition, a range of social changes created an underclass of those without adequate access to farmland or secure employment, vulnerable in times of food shortage: this included many women.
Agriculture and Climate.
Rain-fed agriculture.
Throughout the colonial period, the main subsistence crop of the upland areas that formed much of Nyasaland was maize, which had been introduced from Mozambique, probably starting from the 18th century, and which largely supplanted the previous staple cereals sorghum and millet in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the end of the colonial era, maize accounted for 60% of the areas planted with food crops, providing Nyasaland's inhabitants with over half their calories. Very few cattle were kept in the Shire Highlands, although many smallholders kept a few sheep or goats and most had at least some chickens.
The traditional maize grown in 1949 was late-maturing variety, requiring at least five to eight centimetres of rainfall in each of the first three months of growth, and a further month to ripen. The Shire Highlands generally meets these conditions throughout the normal five-month growing season but, as maize cultivation was mostly rain-fed, variations in the annual rainfall led to substantial fluctuation in crop production
Most of Nyasaland's rain was generated when the Intertropical Convergence Zone passed over the country, usually between November one year and March the next year, but the amount of rainfall varied under the influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and other climate anomalies. Regional climatic studies have identified an intense episode of drought throughout Southern Africa between 1946 and 1949. This caused widespread famine in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in 1947 and less severe droughts in Nyasaland in 1947 and 1948 that led to poor harvests in those years. The severe famine in southern Malawi in 1949 was probably the last phase of this episode of drought.
Access to land.
In the 1940s, Nyasaland smallholders relied on hand hoeing, and a farming family which included two able-bodied adults whose main crop was maize could cultivate 4.5 to 5 acres of land (2.0 hectares) a year; single women were barely able to farm one hectare without assistance. Around 1949, average maize yields were 0.4 ton to an acre (equivalent to 0.9 tonne a hectare). Pressure on access to land increased from the 1940s: even those with access to sufficient arable land might suffer seasonal hunger before harvests, and occasionally endure more serious food shortages in years of inadequate rainfall. Other family units with less land or labour available were frequently at risk of hunger.
About 70% of African smallholders in the Shire Highlands occupied Native Trust Land, for which they paid no rent. This amounted to around 50% of the land in that area and, as the local population increased, Native Trust Land became congested, and much of it was used for almost continuous maize monocropping without crop rotation or fallow. Only those with larger holdings could grow significant amounts of cash crops, and tobacco, the one cash crop widely grown with government encouragement in the Central Province, was less suited to the wetter Shire Highlands, so its cultivation was not encouraged there.
The other 30% of African farmers were tenants on European-owned estates. These estates occupied almost 700,000 acres (280,000 hectares) in the Shire Highlands or about 50% of the available land, including much of the most fertile land in this area. Estate tenants owed rent, originally satisfied by a form of labour service called thangata, but by 1949 it was normally paid either in cash or by delivering specified quantities of tobacco or other cash crops to the landowner. Although there was a significant amount of available land on these estates and rural landlessness was rare, the obligation to produce cash crops to pay rent reduced the areas of land and amount of labour that could be devoted to growing the tenants' own food crops.
Agricultural marketing.
Before the Second World War, little was done in Nyasaland to encourage the commercial production and distribution of food. Although town dwellers needed to purchase their food, little was grown for sale rather than subsistence, as towns were few and small and transport was expensive. It was left to African smallholders and tenants sell their surpluses on local markets and for small-scale African entrepreneurs to distribute food over limited areas. In normal years, most farmers had only small surpluses to sell in local markets. In addition, government policies that paid artificially low prices for the maize which it bought acted as a disincentive to its production for sale.
The Nyasaland government made a number of wartime emergency regulations to control agricultural production, and it made some of these permanent in the post-war period. In 1947, it set up a Maize Control Board, aiming to ensure supplies of maize were maintained for over 67,000 workers and town dwellers in the Southern Province and the others elsewhere who were unable to grow their own food. However, it was underfunded, it paid very low prices for the maize it bought and it was reluctant to promote higher maize production for the home market or for export on the grounds of the cost of purchasing and storing it.
The Maize Control Board aimed to handle only around 5% of the national crop and to set up a small grain reserve. However, as its first two years of operation coincided with the poor harvests of1947 and 1948, it only managed to buy around 2% of the crop in those two years, and was unable to establish any reserve. After the famine, the Board more than doubled the price it paid for maize and handled from 7% of the maize crop in 1951, rising to over 10% of an increased crop in 1952.
Narrative of the Famine.
Background.
Although seasonal hunger before crops were ready to harvest was common in Nyasaland, famine was relatively infrequent in the Shire Highlands during the century after 1850, and the area was sometimes a refuge for those fleeing famine from nearby areas of Mozambique. One drought recorded by early missionaries was in the years 1861 to 1863, which coincided with a time of acute political upheaval that dislocated agriculture, and another occurred in 1922.
The 1949 famine occurred in an area of Nyasaland undergoing rapid economic change in the period after the Second World War. Blantyre District was not simply an area of subsistence farming but one of growing employment in the adjacent towns of Blantyre and Limbe, on European-owned tobacco or tea estates or as migrant labour in the Rhodesias and South Africa. Many local African smallholders grew cash crops, mainly tobacco, and farm land was becoming congested and under pressure to produce enough food crops for a growing urban and rural population. The population of Blantyre District was becoming differentiated and much of it, urban and rural, relied on cash earnings to purchase some or all of their food needs.
The 1949 famine was most severe in the Lunzu and Lirangwe areas of Blantyre District, north of Blantyre city, and was an experience beyond the memory of all except the oldest inhabitants who remembered the 1922 famine. Serious food shortages also occurred in Dedza and Port Herald (Nsanje) districts in that year.
Failing rains.
The rainfall in 1947 and 1948 had been erratic, and in 1947 swarms of locusts had destroyed crops. These events forced farmers to use their stored maize, emptying the reserves in their granaries in advance of the 1949 harvest.
The rainy season of 1948-9 began well in Blantyre District, but the rains lessened in November and December 1948, and six rainless weeks followed in late December and January 1949, normally the wettest part of the season, when no rain clouds were seen. There were considerable local variations, but the worst affected areas had only half their average annual rainfall and lost up to a third of their expected crop. Some of the earliest-planted maize survived but much of the main crop died, and some farmers were unable to replant their maize for lack of rain and because few had any saved seed to plant after the poor harvests of the previous two years. Those with land near riverbanks that retained moisture could harvest some crops, others had relatives in less severely affected areas or received food rations from their employers, but the majority were dependent on what their own land could grow.
Initial reaction.
The initial government response was hampered by a lack of maize available to distribute. In January, the District Commissioner in Blantyre District became concerned about a growing black market in maize flour in the Blantyre town market, and arranged for some of the maize held in a government store to be sold in that market, although the one ton a day released for sale was only sufficient to feed around 500 families. In February 1949, the governor of Nyasaland did not consider that large amounts of famine relief would be needed. He asked the Southern Rhodesian government to send 1,000 tons of maize as soon as possible, and appointed a local businessman as African Foodstuffs Commissioner to arrange supplies of maize and other staple foods, hoping that the business community would assist in its distribution.
After some light rains in February, there was a further four-week drought in March 1949. By then, the situation had become really serious, as most of the maize remaining in farmers’ granaries had been exhausted, much of their cash savings had been spent on buying food and most of their livestock had been sold. Many walked long distances to areas that still had maize for sale or foraged for wild foods. The latter included wild varieties of yam and other tubers, edible roots, small mammals and insects. In many cases, help from better-off relatives dried up as the drought continued, and many men deserted the wives and families that they could not feed.
Small amounts of sweet potatoes and cassava planted by some farmers were available from May to September, but only in September 1949 did the government open food distribution centres. These sold maize at three pence a pound and allowed families to purchase 20 pounds for five shillings each week. Those people without cash, even women deserted by their husbands, had to work for food, as only small numbers of the very elderly and destitute were given minimal free rations. Initially, these centres issued whole maize kernels which had to be pounded but, by January 1950, some of the centres issued ready milled maize, as many women were too weak to pound it, and could not afford to have it milled.
The climax.
Despite the government food distribution, in December 1949 and January 1950, many people in the worst affected areas, particularly young children and the old, showed signs of severe malnutrition, and deaths occurred among the most vulnerable. Some feeding camps were set up where the elderly and destitute were fed maize porridge twice a day, and the worst cases were taken to Blantyre hospital. Around 200 people were reported to have died of starvation: the shock caused by these famine-related deaths was disproportionate to this official mortality figure, because serious famine had reappeared in this area without warning after an absence of more than a quarter of a century The official mortality figure may also be an underestimate and it excludes many weakened by hunger, particularly young children and the elderly, that died of diseases they might otherwise have recovered from.
The government issued free maize seed and cassava cuttings to those sufficiently able-bodied to plant them, and the 1950 harvest was reasonably plentiful despite the weakness of many farmers. In the planting season of 1950/51 many planted drought-resistant cassava as well as maize. The people in the worst-affected areas took some years to recover physically from the famine and to repay their debts and build up food reserves and savings. The social effects, in cases where men had deserted their families or relatives had refused to help distressed families, lasted for many years.
Social differences.
African businessmen or skilled workers and the better-paid government employees that had sufficient cash or assets were little affected by the famine, as were soldiers, policemen and some employees of European or Asian enterprises that were given food rations as part of their pay. Self-employed artisans and traders and those in low-paid, often casual, employment suffered a drastic fall in income as their customers prioritised buying food, or their employment ceased: the degree to which they suffered depended on what savings or saleable assets they had. 
How smallholding farmers managed depended on what cash and food reserves, livestock or other assets they had. In normal times, female-headed households, including those of widows and deserted wives, were usually the poorest group in the community, with little access to land. They often survived by casual work such as beer-brewing or food-for-work labour, both of which ended during the famine. Unless their relatives helped them, these women and their families were very vulnerable. On the other hand, many households of migrant workers received cash from absent husbands throughout the famine.
Relief measures.
A slow start.
In the early months of 1949, when it was clear that most of the maize crop planted in late 1948 would be lost because of drought, the Nyasaland government asked the Rhodesian Maize Control Board, which had been set-up in the 1930s and maintained buffer stocks and imported of maize to send maize to Nyasaland by rail, even though there were already shortages in Northern Rhodesia and one was predicted for Mashonaland. Around 12,500 tons of maize was supplied by these means, 7,500 by June 1949.
As widespread crop failure in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in 1947 had depleted regional stocks, further emergency supplies had to be brought in from further afield. A total of 12,500 tons of maize was imported by sea during the remainder of 1949 and 1950, mostly from the United States and East Africa.
One problem was finding enough ships in the post-war period to transport the purchased maize by sea to the congested port of Beira. A second was that rail link from Beira to Malawi was interrupted by the collapse of the bridge at Chiromo in late 1948, which limited the amount of maize that could be imported and then distributed through a poorly developed road network. Once the supplies of maize reached the affected areas the government opened food distribution centres in September 1949 to sell maize at controlled prices.
Government actions.
The governor Sir Geoffrey Francis Taylor Colby stated that maize rations should be used, firstly, to support essential services such as police and the army, secondly to provide relief in the most affected areas and, thirdly, to contribute towards a reserve, which reached 6,000 tons after the 1950 harvest. He was particularly concerned that making maize available at food distribution centres might discourage people from making their own provisions against future famines.
The effects of the drought of 1948-49 were exacerbated by the colonial government's failure to hold food reserves or provide relief supplies rapidly. Although the last major famine in the Shire Highlands was in 1922, there had been local food shortages here, particularly in Blantyre District in 1939, 1941 and 1947. Resistance to holding food stocks arose partly from the weak finances of the Nyasaland government, but also from an attitude that government food stores would discourage farmers from keeping their own food reserves and make them dependent on the government in the future.
After 1949.
Government opposition to holding food reserves changed in the aftermath of the 1949 famine, and governor Colby took a number of steps to prevent a recurrence. Some of these steps were clearly beneficial: in addition to setting up a reserve maize store, he instructed the Maize Control the Board to increase the price paid for maize significantly, which encouraged farmers to grow maize for sale. In addition, he asked the owners of private estates to grow maize for their own workers on their own land, rather than purchasing it from smallholders. To reduce the overcrowding that existed in some Native Trust land, the government accelerated a scheme to purchase surplus land on the estates, although the largest purchases were from 1952 onwards.
The first of two more doubtful steps was the reduction in the price that the Native Tobacco Board paid for tobacco grown on Native Trust lands. The governor's intention was to reduce the volume of tobacco grown while increasing its quality and using the increased profit the Board made for agricultural development. This significantly reduced the incomes of most of the farmers that had grown tobacco and did little in the short term to increase the quality of the crop. The introduction in the early 1950s of a compulsory registration scheme for tobacco growers led to a 20% reduction in their numbers by 1955.
Secondly, the agricultural development that the governor proposed involved the appointment of government agricultural officers to enforce soil conservation and land use legislation that was bitterly resented by many African smallholders as it involved them in unpaid labour and took some cultivable land out of use. Although the main architect of these schemes claimed they were vital to prevent an environmental catastrophe, this view was later contradicted and, until the 1980s, soil fertility in most of the country remained adequate.
Causes of the famine.
Views in 1949.
Although the immediate cause of an almost complete failure of the maize harvest in large parts of the Shire Highlands was a lack of rain at critical points in the growing season, the extent and intensity of the ensuing famine in the area has been attributed to a number of additional causes. Later research has cast doubt on the reality of those causes that were widely canvassed at the time, and suggested other possible reasons.
Even before 1949, Nyasaland's colonial Agriculture Department held negative views about African agricultural practices, and predicted that, unless they were checked, they would cause a rapid decline in soil fertility This opinion has been contradicted by more recent research, which showed that in 1998, almost 50 years after the 1949 famine, most soils in Malawi were adequate for growing maize, as fertility had declined much less rapidly than the department had forecast. Most soils tested in 1998 still contained sufficient organic material and nutrients for crop growing, if barely so, although they would have benefited from chemical fertilisers or manure.
Another view that attempted to place a degree of blame on African smallholders on Native Trust Land was that they were growing tobacco to the detriment of food production. Relatively little tobacco was grown on Native Trust Land in the Shire Highlands, partly as the Native Tobacco Board discouraged it where it competed with tobacco grown on European-owned private estates and partly as grades of leaf suitable for cigarettes were difficult to grow in the climate of the Shire Highlands. Farm surveys indicate that only farmers with larger holdings in that area grew tobacco, and these also retained most of their land for food crops.
Tenants on the private did estates often grow tobacco and other saleable crops to pay rents in lieu of cash, although some preferred to grow maize to sell in local markets and pay a cash rent. Some large private estates were destroying soil fertility by seeking quick profits: a government survey showed that many were badly managed and deforested, and that their soil and grassland had been abused. However, most tenants had sufficiently large plots to feed their families and grow the required cash crops; only those tenants with insufficient land or labour to cultivate it suffered in the famine.
Underdevelopment theories.
Nyasaland has been described as an Imperial Slum, or as a failed Colonial State by two leading proponents of the underdevelopment view of colonialism. The imposition of rents on tenants on private estates and underpayment for the produce of smallholders, together with taxes on both groups, certainly constituted a significant burden on African farmers. However, in the economic boom of the 1940s, these impositions were less significant than in earlier periods.
Both Vail and Mandala suggest that the Imperial government showed little interest in Nyasaland, a country without valuable resources but with heavy administration costs. These authors concentrate on the period before 1939, when government revenue was low, with much of it coming from taxes on Africans, and mostly absorbed in routine administration costs, leaving very little available for development. Both also concentrate on the inefficiency and perceived high cost of the protectorate's transport system.
However, Vail's argument that the cost of railway links impoverished the country, preventing the government from promoting efficient peasant agriculture is overstated for the latter part of the half-century he covers. The Nyasaland government only had to pay interest and repay capital on the loans for constructing the Trans-Zambezia Railway or Zambezi Bridge if its revenues exceeded target figures. During the period 1930 to 1947, it only paid interest in 1936 and repaid no capital at all. All the accrued liabilities passed to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953.
Coping strategies.
The seasonal hunger common in pre-colonial times gave rise to several coping strategies. In a subsistence economy, farmers grew food for their families’ needs and small surpluses were usually stored, bartered for livestock or given to dependants Markets where food was exchanged for cash were established during the colonial era, and it is likely that introduction of a market economy eventually created an underclass of the chronically malnourished poor. The older strategies were supplemented by the use of cash to make good food deficits, whether it was earned directly, remitted by a migrant worker relative or borrowed.
Some coping strategies were still in use in 1949, including growing drought resistant crops like millet, cassava or sweet potatoes in case the maize crop failed, gathering wild food or relying on support from family or friends. However, the growing of sorghum and millet was actively discouraged by government agricultural policies, which also discouraged the cultivation of riverbanks and marshland, both of which retained moisture after the rainy season. Although these policies originated before the 1949 famine, they were not relaxed during or immediately after it.
The coping strategies described were meant to deal with seasonal hunger, but they helped at least some of those affected by the 1949 famine, mainly during its early stages. However, the vulnerable groups, including old or disabled people, single women and others without family support were less able to use these strategies.
Vulnerable groups.
The colonial economy created winners and losers: in 1949, most of Nyasaland's people either experienced hunger that was not life-threatening or, in the case of the most privileged, little or no hunger at all. It was the new vulnerable groups that arose during the colonial period who suffered most in that famine. These included men made landless by eviction from private estates, widows and deserted wives with children, who were unable to cultivate enough land for their subsistence, and casual employees and those self-employed people reliant on a previously buoyant economy.
In the terms proposed by Amartya Sen, the vulnerable groups mentioned above either lacked a food entitlement or had had their food entitlement sharply reduced by a change in their circumstances, and their exposure to famine was an entitlement failure. A minority of people in Nyasaland in 1949, soldiers, police, some workers on private estates and domestic servants received food rations or food at subsidised prices. Urban workers such as clerks earned enough to give them food security and the families of migrant workers often received cash remittances that gave them security.
However, the majority of people in 1949 depended on agriculture not rations or earnings. In the years before 1949, a rising population led to fear of land shortage, to more intense cultivation and possibly to some over-cropping. Even so, in the 30 years following the famine, smallholders adapted to smaller farm plots with a substantial increase in the production of maize and other food crops, once the incentives they received made this possible. It was therefore either not having access to sufficient land to grow their own food or lacking a secure cash income that created the casualties of the 1949 famine. It was not that there was insufficient land or that it was badly managed so much as its distribution was uneven.
Food insecurity in Malawi.
For around 30 years after the 1949 famine, the country suffered no significant droughts and its farmers were able to adapt to smaller plots and to increase the production of maize and other food crops substantially, by benefiting from improved seeds and fertilizer. Between 1950 and 1979 the annual maize crop exceeded consumption except in 1963, 1970, 1975 and 1976 and shortfalls were made good from reserves. However, after 1980 food insecurity became an increasing problem in the country, leading to a perennial Malawian food crisis.
Bad weather in 1980, 1990, 1997 and 1998 significantly reduced maize harvests, but famines were avoided. In 1997 and 1998, famine was averted by the release of government grain reserves and overseas maize purchases, whereas in 2001 and 2002, when harvests were not as bad as in 1997 or 1998, deficiencies in grain reserves and import delays led to a significant famine.
Malawi suffered widespread food shortages in the 1990s and 2000s, and several of the issues which arose then were the same as those already apparent in 1949. These included the use of land for farming tobacco and other non-food crops, the growth of an underclass of land-poor or landless rural people who were dependent on casual work and the strict governmental controls on growing and marketing of certain crops. In more recent times, as in 1949, it was the lack of food reserves within the country and delays in importing relief supplies that turned shortages into famine. Even the idea, probably incorrect in 1949, that soil fertility was declining and soil erosion was becoming critical had become true by 1992, when cultivation had spread up hillsides and onto steep Rift Valley slopes, where erosion was inevitable and unsustainable.

SOS Méditerranée

SOS Méditerranée is a European, maritime-humanitarian organisation for the rescue of life at sea, currently operating in the Mediterranean sea in international waters north of Libya. The organization chartered the "Aquarius" and more recently the "Ocean Viking" in order to rescue people fleeing by sea from Libya and who risk drowning. The group was founded in June 2015 by German former captain Klaus Vogel and Frenchwoman Sophie Beau after the Italian navy ended the rescue Operation Mare Nostrum in 2014. Its headquarters are in Marseille, France.
European migration.
The organization is best known for its actions during the European migrant crisis of rescuing migrants from sinking vessels in international waters north of Libya and providing the survivors with medical care and shelter, before being disembarked in a place of safety mostly in European ports in Italy and Malta. Since the start of the rescue operation in 2015, the Aquarius has saved more than 29000 lives. They are considered a "taxi service for migrants" by Italian Minister of the Interior, deputy prime minister and leader of the far right anti-migration party La Lega Matteo Salvini and have been denied entry to Italy and Malta. They work in partnership with Doctors Without Borders. SOS Méditerranée clashed with Libyan coastguards during 2017 but continues to operate in the Libyan search and rescue region in international waters north of Libya.
Network.
SOS Méditerranée works as a European association with teams in Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland forming a European network, jointly financing and operating the rescue ship Aquarius, which has been in continuous operation since February 2016 in international waters between Italy and Libya. 
The medical care has been provided by Doctors without Borders since May 2016.
The Aquarius.
It is a robust and seaworthy ship that offers wide spaces below deck, making it very suitable for year-round use as a rescue ship in the Mediterranean.
Until 2009 the "Aquarius" was operated as a fishery protection vessel. 
SOS Méditerranée used the "Aquarius" from February 2016 to October 2018, after which operations have continued with the "Ocean Viking".
Ocean Viking.
On 21 July 2019 SOS Méditerranée announced a new rescue campaign off the Libyan coast, using a cargo ship, the "Ocean Viking". The approach is supported by the Norwegian authorities; the vessel is registered there. The operation costs € 14,000 per day. The 69 m long by 15 m wide vessel was built in 1986 to serve as a support vessel for oil rigs in the North Sea. She is operated by around thirty people (nine crew members, a search and rescue team and medical personnel) and can carry up to 200 survivors. Ocean Viking is faster and better equipped than the Aquarius. Onboard microphones and cameras will make it possible to record everything that happens on board and around the boat, in order to prove, if necessary, that operations are carried out within a legal framework. The ship, which will respect the ban on disembarking migrants in Italian ports, is banned from refueling in Malta. 
As of 2021, SOS Méditerranée continues its life-saving rescue operations using the "Ocean Viking".
Funding.
SOS MEDITERRANEE is a non-profit association and is financed through private and public donations. 
Its partner, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), contributes to the monthly costs for the Aquarius and staffs the medical team on board.

Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney

The Royal Victoria Theatre was a theatre in Sydney, Australia, the first large theatre in the city. It opened in 1838; operas, plays, pantomimes and other events were held, and leading entertainers performed at the theatre. It was destroyed by fire in 1880.
Background and opening.
The theatre was built by Joseph Wyatt; formerly a haberdasher, he had been a lessee of the first theatre in Sydney, the Theatre Royal, since 1835, and the sole lessee since 1836. In that year he planned another larger theatre. The building was designed by Henry Robertson; the foundation stone was laid on 7 September 1836.
The new theatre, in Pitt Street, opened on 26 March 1838, with a performance of Shakespeare's "Othello". The theatre had a three-storey façade of Georgian style, and the front section included a hotel. The interior was of Regency style. There were 1,900 seats. 1,000 were in a large pit extending below the dress circle – the first theatre in Australia to have this arrangement – with upper circle and gallery above. Entry to the dress and upper circle was through the main entrance, and other patrons used a side entrance. "The Sydney Monitor" reported that the building was "truly elegant. ... From the pit you would suppose that you were in a large provincial theatre in England." In 1841 the theatre was fitted with gas lighting.
Following years.
Actors associated with the Theatre Royal moved to the Victoria Theatre, including John Lazar, who was manager of the theatre until the early 1840s. The population of Sydney was small in relation to the size of the theatre, so that a proper repertoire could not be built up: there were frequent changes of programme, leading to poorly rehearsed performances.
In March 1841 Wyatt sailed for England to recruit actors, returning in January 1843. While he was away the theatre was managed by William Knight, a hotel owner. The new actors engaged faced opposition from the Sydney actors, and the "Sydney Morning Herald" commented on 25 January 1843: "Of the twelve brought out by him from England there is not one equal in ability to the leading members, male or female, of the old company". Wyatt eventually sacked some of his actors.
Operas, dramas, burlesques, pantomimes and other amusements were held. George Coppin made his Australian debut in the theatre in 1843. Other performers seen during the theatre's history included Lola Montez, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, Anna Bishop, George Darrell and William Creswick. The first opera written, composed and produced in Australia, "Don John of Austria", premiered there in May 1847.
In 1854 the theatre was purchased by a consortium including Joshua Josephson, and leased by a succession of managers, including Wilson and Habbe 1870–71, when Mary Gladestane had a season, first as Frou-Frou, then in October as Queen Elizabeth, when Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh attended.
On 22 July 1880, the uninsured theatre burned to the ground. The site, at 199 Pitt Street, was taken over for Harris &amp; Ackman's new auction rooms.

Societal Impact.
Zambian police units do not perform at the level of a U.S. police force in terms of capability, responsiveness, discipline, or professionalism. The Zambia Police Service is almost solely a reactive force and demonstrates rather poor proactive law enforcement techniques and initiative to deter or investigate crime. Police often lack equipment, resources, training, and personnel to respond to calls for assistance or other emergencies. Police response times can be long, if they respond at all. Police often cite a lack of adequate transportation as an excuse for slow/no response.  
Most crimes go unreported and/or uninvestigated. The police have a poor record of solving serious crimes. According to Zambia Police crime statistics for the third quarter of 2019, the nationwide arrest rate from crimes averages 50%. 
Inadequate legislation and investigation results in the lack of prosecution or large numbers of acquittals. Corruption occurs at all levels, resulting in an ineffective legal and justice system. Vigilantism is present as a result.
Low pay and morale create an environment in which bribes of even a few dollars can make allegations or charges disappear. 
The major law enforcement agencies are the Zambia Police Service (a nationwide police force responsible for traditional policing and investigations), Immigration, Customs, the Drug Enforcement Commission, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and the Department of National Parks and Wildlife. There is no dedicated “Border Patrol.” Border security alternates between whichever law enforcement agency may have a presence at a border post at any given time. 
The legislative and constitutional provisions that provide for the Zambia Police Service meet the most basic requirements of the rule of law, which is defined by Carothers as a system in which the laws are public knowledge, are clear, apply to everyone equally, and uphold political and civil liberties.

Huriawa Peninsula

Huriawa, commonly known as Huriawa Peninsula or Karitane Peninsula, is a headland on the coast of Otago, New Zealand. It is located 35 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre, immediately to the southeast of the settlement of Karitane.
The peninsula is steep and rocky, and stretches east for approximately 1000 metres from the mainland at the mouth of the Waikouaiti River. At its narrowest, the isthmus connecting it with Karitane is only some 90 metres in width. The name "huriawa" is a Māori term meaning "turning river"; the Waikouaiti River, which now flows to the sea to the north of the peninsula, formerly entered the sea to the peninsula's south. The southern, ocean coast of the peninsula is lined with sheer cliffs, and includes several rock pinnacles and blowholes. The northern, estuary coast is less rugged, but still steep. The opposite bank of the river is the large sandspit which forms the southern end of Waikouaiti Beach.
The isthmus is the site of Karitane cemetery, and of a memorial marking the location of the first Christian sermon given in Otago, by Rev. James Watkin on 17 May 1840. 
The western end of the peninsula is dotted with a handful of houses and other buildings, the most notable of which is Sir Truby King's historic Kingscliff House. The remaining four fifths of the peninsula is designated as a historic reserve.
Huriawa pā site and reserve.
The reserve covers the area previously occupied by Huriawa pā (Te Pa a Te Wera) a major coastal Māori fortification, believed to have been established by Kai Tahu chief Te Wera in the years immediately preceding Captain James Cook's visit to New Zealand in the late 18th century. The six-month siege of the pā by Te Wera's cousin Taoka (presumably in the mid-18th century) is one of most widely recorded pre-colonial events along the Otago coastline. The pā had the strength given to it by its inaccessible location and also due to the natural spring (Te Punawai a Te Wera) which provided it with its own water supply. The siege was one of a number of battles between the two chiefs which ranged along the coastline from Timaru to the mouth of Otago Harbour.
Huriawa Historic Reserve covers and is accessible to the general public. It features a loop track some 2.5 kilometres in length. The title to Huriawa was returned to the Kai Tahu iwi by the Crown in 1998 as part of the iwi's Waitangi Tribunal land claim settlement, and is managed by Kāti Huirapa Rūnaka ki Puketeraki and the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

Lawless Lawyer

Lawless Lawyer () is a legal thriller television series that ran in 2018 and stars Lee Joon-gi, Seo Yea-ji, Lee Hye-young and Choi Min-soo.

The series follows characters Bong Sang-pil and Ha Jae-yi who form the Lawless Law Firm. Sang-pil, a former gangster turned lawyer, seeks to avenge his mother and fight against those with absolute power. He often resorts to using his fists and loopholes in the law to achieve his goals. Ha Jae-yi is a lawyer of high integrity who works with Sang-pil after she is suspended for assaulting a judge. Together they use the law to fight for justice against corrupt judge Cha Moon-sook and her associates.
Lawless Lawyer premiered on tvN on May 12, 2018. It concluded on July 1, 2018 with the airing of the 16th episode. The series was a commercial hit and became one of the highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television history.
Plot.
Background.
18 years prior to the events of the series, Cha Moon-sook murders a man critical of her late father. She then orders gangster Ahn Oh-joo to cover it up. Lawyer Cho Jin-ae discovers the truth of the event due to pictures taken by Noh Hyung-joo. Oh-joo murders Jin-ae but her young son Sang-pil escapes with the help of Hyung-joo. Sang-pil flees to his uncle Choi Dae-woong, who is a gangster in Seoul. Hyung-joo is forced to leave her husband and young daughter Ha Jae-yi behind to flee the country. Moon-sook becomes a prominent judge and is seen as a pillar of the community. Oh-joo becomes the boss of large corporation and gains wealth. Sang-pil and Jae-yi both become lawyers in the city of Seoul.
Synopsis.
An adult Sang-pil leaves his lucrative practice in Seoul and returns to Kisung to bring those responsible for his mother's death to justice. He takes over a loan shark business and converts it into the Lawless Law Firm. Jae-yi is suspended from practicing law after assaulting a judge, loses her job, and also returns home to Kisung. She soon ends up working for Sang-pil, and later becomes his partner when reinstated as a lawyer. After learning the truth about Moon-sook, she joins Sang-pil in his pursuit of justice for the wrong done to their mothers. Together, they use the law to fight against Moon-sook and her associates. Over time, they fall in love.
Moon-sook and Oh-joo grow in influence and power through corrupt methods; Oh-joo becomes the mayor of Kisung and Moon-sook is nominated for chief justice in the Supreme Court. They and their associates oppose the Lawless Law Firm both inside and outside the courtroom by using underhanded tactics, including murdering Dae-woong and framing Sang-pil for it, bribing or threatening witnesses and assaulting Jae-yi. Despite the obstacles in their way, Sang-pil and Jae-yi succeed in revealing Moon-sook's crimes in court and successfully plead their case against her. Moon-sook and her associates end up in prison, whereas Oh-joo commits suicide. Jae-yi and Sang-pil then return to Seoul to help Prosecutor Cheon Seung-beom fight against corrupt officials.
Production.
In early 2018, Namoo Actors revealed that Lee Joon-gi was in talks to play a lawyer in an upcoming drama. However, details of the drama and its release date remained unknown. Then in February, Lee Joon-gi confirmed that he had been cast as the male lead. It would be his first production with director Kim Jin-min since Time Between Dog and Wolf in 2007. Soon after, Seo Yea-ji was confirmed as the female lead opposite Lee Joon-gi.
The first script reading took place on February 28, 2018 at Studio Dragon in Sangam-dong, Seoul, South Korea. The results of the script reading reportedly helped Studio Dragon to build confidence in the drama.
Awards and nominations.
For her portrayal of an honest lawyer, Seo Yea-ji was named as an honorary police officer.

Augusta von Zitzewitz

Augusta von Zitzewitz (26 December 1880 – 14 November 1960) was a German artist, based, for most of her working life, in Berlin. Early on in her career she was associated with the Berlin Secession movement. She is best known for her portraits.
Life.
Augusta von Zitzewitz was born in Berlin, a daughter of the Prussian Oberleutnant Coelestin Friedrich von Zitzewitz and his wife, born Elise Köbel. Because of her mother's English provenance she and her eight siblings grew up bilingual. According to family tradition she was christened "Augusta" after the empress Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1811-1890), the politically liberal wife of the old German emperor. Her father died in 1892, a few months after her eleventh birthday, and she was sent away to complete her education at the "Kaiserin-Augusta-Stift", a Potsdam boarding school which later formed the unsympathetic backdrop for Christa Winsloe's drama, Girls in Uniform.
In 1907, presumably with the backing of her widowed mother, in 1907, she embarked on an arts training with . An arts training at one of the more mainstream Berlin academies would not have been accessible to her on account of her gender. One of her teachers during the next few years was the "Secessionist", George Mosson. She rented her own little studio in 1911, the year in which she was admitted to membership of the Berlin Association of Women Artists.
She had been urged by Käthe Kollwitz to familiarise herself with modern art trends and artists in Paris. In Autumn 1912 she went to Paris to study at the Académie Julian. She also studied with the Cubist, Jean Metzinger. Her studies in Paris, where she was also taught by André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Henri Le Fauconnier, continued till 1914. Her friends and Fanny Remark were also studying in Paris at this time. Along with her studies, von Zitzewitz found time in Paris to make contact with the art dealer and to spend time with the circle of avant-garde cubists around Henri Matisse who would gather at the Café du Dome.
Augusta von Zitzewitz married the art-historian Erich Römer (1888-1934) in 1914. Their daughter, Ilse-Marie Römer (1915-1964) was born the next year. Ilse-Marie would later often model for her mother.
It was also in 1915 that she became a member of the recently formed Free Secession artists' association. During the next couple of decades she established herself as an artist, producing landscapes, interiors, still lifes and nudes. Notable portrait subjects included members of the Berlin intellectual and cultural milieu such as Alfred Kerr, , , Claire Waldoff and Renée Sintenis. She also had an important sideline in woodcut prints, notably for the radical leftwing political weekly Die Aktion, between 1917 and 1932. Her mother died in 1922. From this point till she died Augusta von Zitzewitz lived at in Berlin-Westend.
At the start of 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. In opposition the Nazis had based their appeal on the traditional populist twin pillars of hatred and hope. The shrill antisemitism on display at Nazi meeting during the 1920s was integrated into government strategy in ways that many found hard to comprehend. Erich Römer was identified by the authorities as Jewish, which meant that the couple's daughter, Ilse, was classified as half-Jewish. Between 1933 and 1945 Augusta von Zitzewitz was subjected to a ban on working or exhibiting inside Germany. The Nazi writ did not run in North America, however, and she was able to exhibit at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. Ilse faced additional race-based risks and was prevented from attending secondary school.
Despite the ban, she produced a succession of further portraits on a private basis. As a full member of the German Artists' Association, she participated in its activities until the forcible closure in 1936 of the by the government backed .
War ended in May 1945, and with it the Nazi régime. Berlin was divided into military occupation zones. Von Zitzewitz returned to her destroyed studio in Berlin-Charlottenburg (Reichstraßestraße 97) which she had left shortly before the war ended. Charlottenburg had ended up at the heart of what became West Berlin. The priority was on survival. She painted portraits using the light from a kerosene lamp and exchanged them for food. And as the rubble began to be cleared and the rebuilding got under way she re-established her place in the arts scene, once more painting leading figures from the literary and arts scenes. She was now able to stage exhibitions across West Germany, notably in Munich, Hamburg and Bremen. There were exhibitions in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1950 and 1958, followed in 1961 by a posthumous commemorative exhibition in the context of that year's . Another notable posthumous exhibition, arranged by the at Kiel Castle (Rantzau building) in 1980/81, celebrated the centenary of her birth.
Celebration.
At the house where she lived and worked (Reichsstr. 96/97, 14052 Berlin), a wall-mounted tablet commemorating Augusta von Zitzewitz was unveiled on 17 August 2003.

2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier

The 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier was a cricket tournament held during October and November 2019 in the United Arab Emirates to determine which teams would qualify for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. The six teams finishing highest in the qualifier tournament joined Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the first group stage of the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. The tournament formed part of the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier series, with the Netherlands winning the final.
In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals and the Qualifier itself, were played as full Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events, which put their participation in the tournament in doubt. The following month, with Zimbabwe banned from taking part in international cricket tournaments, the ICC named Nigeria as their replacement in the tournament.
Papua New Guinea were the first team to qualify for the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup from the tournament, after they won Group A, finishing above the Netherlands on net run rate. It was the first time that Papua New Guinea had qualified for a World Cup in any format. Ireland became the second team to qualify when they won Group B, also on net run rate. Both teams also advanced to the playoff section of the qualifier. They were joined by the Netherlands, Namibia and Scotland from Group A, and Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong from Group B.
In the first qualifier match in the playoffs, the Netherlands qualified for the T20 World Cup when they beat the United Arab Emirates by eight wickets, after the UAE only scored 80 runs in their innings. The second qualifier match saw Namibia advance to their first T20 World Cup after beating Oman by 54 runs. Scotland beat tournament hosts the United Arab Emirates in the third qualifier by 90 runs to secure their place in the Men's T20 World Cup. The final qualifier match saw Oman become the last team to qualify for the Men's T20 World Cup, after they narrowly beat Hong Kong by 12 runs.
Scotland beat Oman by five wickets to win the fifth-place playoff match. In the first semi-final, the Netherlands beat Ireland by 21 runs to advance to the final. They were joined in the final with Papua New Guinea, after they beat Namibia by 18 runs in the second semi-final. Ireland beat Namibia by 27 runs to win the third-place playoff. The final saw the Netherlands beat Papua New Guinea by seven wickets to win the tournament. Namibia's captain, Gerhard Erasmus, was named the player of the tournament.
Teams and qualifications.
Sub-regional qualification groups began on 26 February 2018 in Argentina. In the Americas group, both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda registered wins against Argentina. A total of 61 Associate Member teams out of originally scheduled 62 teams competed. Of these teams, 25 of them progressed to the regional finals in 2019, with the top seven teams progressing to the qualifier tournament. They were joined by the top six teams from the 2015 qualifier that were outside the top ten places in the ICC T20I Championship by the cut-off date of 31 December 2018, and the tournament host.
ICC T20I Championship.
Host nation, Australia, and the nine best teams (according to the ICC T20I Championship ranking of 31 December 2018) who played in the last edition of ICC Men's T20 World Cup qualified for the final tournament directly. The remaining six entrants from the last tournament competed in the Regional Qualifiers of the World Cup qualifying tournaments. Of the teams in the ICC T20I Championship ranking, initially the United Arab Emirates and Nepal could only qualify through regional competitions. However, in March 2019, the ICC announced that the UAE would host the qualifier tournament, resulting in their automatic qualification. Later the same month, the ICC released the match schedule for all the Regional Finals, with the UAE omitted from the fixture list for the Asia Regional Final. The number of teams that could qualify from the Asia Regional Final was also reduced from two to one.
The final rankings for automatic qualification as of 31 December 2018 were as follows:
&lt;noinclude&gt;
Regional qualifications.
62 teams were originally scheduled to compete in 12 regional qualification groups during 2018 across five regions, with 61 taking part. The top 25 teams progressed to five regional finals in 2019, with eight teams progressing to the 2019 qualifier tournament. The host nation of each sub-regional group and regional final groups are shown in bold. All the sub-regional stage matches in the European section were held in the Netherlands.
Squads.
UAE squad.
Ahead of the tournament, Mohammad Naveed was withdrawn from the UAE's squad, with Ahmed Raza named as captain in his place. Qadeer Ahmed and Shaiman Anwar were also dropped from the UAE's squad, with Waheed Ahmed, Darius D'Silva and Junaid Sidique added to their squad. Two days before the start of the tournament, the ICC confirmed that the three players dropped from the UAE's squad had all been suspended after they had breached cricket's anti-corruption rules. Mohammad Naveed and Shaiman Anwar were believed to be planning to fix matches in the tournament, while Qadeer Ahmed was approached to fix a match during the UAE's tour of Zimbabwe in April 2019. On 21 October 2019, Ashfaq Ahmed became the fourth UAE cricketer to be suspended by the ICC. Ahmed had played in the first two matches for the team in the tournament.
On 21 October 2019, Ghulam Shabber, the UAE's wicket-keeper, did not show up for the pre-match meeting ahead of the fixture against Hong Kong. It later transpired that Shabber had left the country without an explanation, before being traced to Pakistan. On 26 October 2019, in an interview for "The National", Shabber denied any involvement with corruption and announced his retirement from cricket, citing the poor remuneration for playing. He said that "if there is something with regards to anti-corruption, I am ready to cooperate in Pakistan. But I have decided cricket is not in my future".
Following the conclusion of the group stage, the ICC's Event Technical Committee approved two replacements in the UAE's squad. Faizan Asif replaced Ashfaq Ahmed and Vriitya Aravind was named as Ghulam Shabber's replacement. On 30 October 2019, the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that they had suspended Shabber for absconding, and that he was part of the ICC's anti-corruption investigation. In March 2021, Mohammad Naveed and Shaiman Anwar were both found guilty of corruption, with each player given an eight-year ban from all cricket, backdated to 16 October 2019. In July 2021, the ICC also handed eight-year bans to Amir Hayat and Ashfaq Ahmed for violating the anti-corruption code. Their bans were both backdated to 13 September 2020. In September 2021, the ICC also issued a four-year ban to Ghulam Shabber, following the conclusion of their anti-corruption investigation.
Other changes.
In September 2019, ahead of the 2019–20 Oman Pentangular Series, Hong Kong's Babar Hayat declared that he was no longer available to play for Hong Kong. Brothers Tanveer Ahmed and Ehsan Nawaz also withdrew themselves for selection.
Anantha Krishna was ruled out of Singapore's squad after suffering an injury in a training session. He was replaced by Aahan Gopinath Achar. On 24 October 2019, the ICC announced that the bowling actions of Abiodun Abioye (Nigeria), Tom Sole (Scotland) and Selladore Vijayakumar (Singapore) were all found to be illegal. They were all suspended from bowling in international cricket matches until an assessment shows that their bowling action is legal.
Ahead of the playoff matches, Dylan Budge replaced Ollie Hairs in Scotland's squad, after Hairs suffered a fracture in his foot. Ireland also made a replacement, with Barry McCarthy coming into their squad, replacing David Delany, who was ruled out with a knee injury.
Match officials.
In October 2019, the ICC named the officials for the tournament, with G. S. Lakshmi becoming the first woman to be named as a referee at an ICC event.
Referees.
The ICC also named three match referees for the tournament.
Warm-up matches.
Ahead of the main tournament, each team played two warm-up matches.
Final standings.
These were the final standings following the conclusion of the tournament. The top six places were used for seeding purposes for the 2020 Men's T20 World Cup.

Online hate speech

Online hate speech is a type of speech that takes place online with the purpose of attacking a person or a group based on their race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.
Online hate speech is not easily defined, but can be recognized by the degrading or dehumanizing function it serves.
Multilateral treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have sought to define its contours. Multi-stakeholders processes (e.g. the Rabat Plan of Action) have tried to bring greater clarity and suggested mechanisms to identify hateful messages. Yet, hate speech is still a generic term in everyday discourse, mixing concrete threats to individuals and/or groups with cases in which people may be simply venting their anger against authority. Internet intermediaries—organizations that mediate online communication such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google—have advanced their own definitions of hate speech that bind users to a set of rules and allow companies to limit certain forms of expression. National and regional bodies have sought to promote understandings of the term that are more rooted in local traditions.
The Internet's speed and reach makes it difficult for governments to enforce national legislation in the virtual world. Social media is a private space for public expression, which makes it difficult for regulators. Some of the companies owning these spaces have become more responsive towards tackling the problem of hate speech online.
Politicians, activists, and academics discuss the character of online hate speech and its relation to offline speech and action, but the debates tend to be removed from systematic empirical evidence. The character of perceived hate speech and its possible consequences has led to placing much emphasis on the solutions to the problem and on how they should be grounded in international human rights norms. Yet this very focus has also limited deeper attempts to understand the causes underlying the phenomenon and the dynamics through which certain types of content emerge, diffuse and lead—or not—to actual discrimination, hostility or violence.
Online hate speech has been on the rise since the start of 2020, with COVID-19 tensions, Anti-Asian rhetoric, ongoing racial injustice, mass civil unrest, violence, and the 2020 Presidential Election. Yet, many instances of hate speech have been refuted with the First Amendment, which allows online hate speech to continue.
Definitions.
Hate speech.
The concept of hate speech touches on the clash of freedom of expression and individual, group and minority rights, as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. It is not easily defined but can be recognized by its function.
In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm, particularly discrimination, hostility or violence, based upon the targets' social and/or demographic identity. Hate Speech may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. The concept may extend also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted discrimination, hostility and violent attacks. At critical times, such as during elections, the concept of hate speech may be prone to manipulation; accusations of fomenting hate speech may be traded among political opponents or used by those in power to curb dissent and criticism. Hate speech (be it conveyed through text, images or sound) can be identified by approximation through the degrading or dehumanizing functions that it serves. Hate Speech contains two types of messages. The first message is addressed to the targeted group and functions to dehumanize and diminish members of this group. The following is an example of this type of message:
"Don't be fooled into thinking you are welcome here. [...] You are not wanted, and you and your families will be shunned, excluded, beaten, and driven out, whenever we can get away with it. We may have to keep a low profile right now. But don't get too comfortable. [...] Be afraid."
The other message in hate speech is to let others with similar opinions know they are not alone, and to reinforce a sense of an in-group that is (purportedly) under threat. The following is an example of this type of message, sent to like-minded individuals:
"We know some of you agree that these people are not wanted here. We know that some of you feel that they are dirty (or dangerous or criminal or terrorist). Know now that you are not alone. [...] There are enough of us around to make sure these people are not welcome. There are enough of us around to draw attention to what these people are really like."
Characteristics.
The proliferation of hate speech online, observed by the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues poses a new set of challenges. Both social networking platforms and organizations created to combat hate speech have recognized that hateful messages disseminated online are increasingly common and have elicited unprecedented attention to develop adequate responses. According to HateBase, a web-based application that collects instances of hate speech online worldwide, the majority of cases of hate speech target individuals based on ethnicity and nationality, but incitements to hatred focusing on religion and class have also been on the rise.
While hate speech online is not intrinsically different from similar expressions found offline, there are peculiar challenges unique to online content and its regulation. Those challenges related to its permanence, itinerancy, anonymity and complex cross-jurisdictional character.
Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute, has noted, "The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can inflict on the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesn't stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates." Twitter's conversations organized around trending topics may facilitate the quick and wide spreading of hateful messages, but they also offer the opportunity for influential speakers to shun messages and possibly end popular threads inciting violence. Facebook, on the contrary, may allow multiple threads to continue in parallel and go unnoticed; creating longer lasting spaces that offend, discriminate, and ridicule certain individuals and groups.
Hate speech online can be itinerant. Even when content is removed, it may find expression elsewhere, possibly on the same platform under a different name or on different online spaces. If a website is shut down, it can quickly reopen using a web-hosting service with less stringent regulations or via the reallocation to a country with laws imposing higher threshold for hate speech. The itinerant nature of hate speech also means that poorly formulated thoughts, or under-the-influence behavior, that would have not found public expression and support in the past may now land on spaces where they can be visible to large audiences.
Anonymity can also present a challenge to dealing with online hate speech. "(T)he internet facilitates anonymous and pseudonymous discourse, which can just as easily accelerate destructive behavior as it can fuel public discourse." As Drew Boyd, Director of Operations at The Sentinel Project, has stated, "the Internet grants individuals the ability to say horrific things because they think they will not be discovered. This is what makes online hate speech so unique, because people feel much more comfortable speaking hate as opposed to real life when they have to deal with the consequences of what they say." China and South Korea enforce real-name policies for social media. Facebook, LinkedIn, and Quora have sought to activate a real-name system to have more control on online hate speech. Such measures have been deeply contested as they hit at the right to privacy and its intersection with free expression.
Many instances of online hate speech are posted by Internet "trolls," which are typically pseudonymous users who post shocking, vulgar, and overall untrue content that is meant to trigger a negative reaction out of people, as well as trick, influence, and sometimes recruit them, if they share the same opinion. Social media has provided a platform for radical or extremist political groups to form, network, and collaborate to spread their messages of anti-establishment and anti-political correctness, and promote ideologies that are racist, anti-feminist, homophobic, etc. Fully-anonymous online communication is rare, as it requires the user to employ highly technical measures to ensure that they cannot be easily identified.
A further complication is the transnational reach of the Internet, raising issues of cross jurisdictional co-operation in regard to legal mechanisms for combating hate speech. While there are Mutual Legal Assistance treaties in place across Europe, Asia, and North America, these are characteristically slow to work. The transnational reach of many private-sector Internet intermediaries may provide a more effective channel for resolving issues in some cases, although these bodies are also often impacted upon by cross-jurisdictional appeals for data (such as revealing the identity of the author(s) of a particular content). Each country has a different understanding of what defines as hate speech, making it difficult to prosecute perpetrators of online hate speech, especially in The US where there is a deep-rooted constitutional commitment to the Freedom of Speech.
Unlike the dissemination of hate speech through conventional channels, online hate speech dissemination involves multiple actors, whether knowingly or not. When perpetrators disseminate their hateful message on social media, they do not only hurt their victims, but may also violate terms of service in that platform and at times even state law, depending on their location. The victims, on their part, may feel helpless in the face of online harassment, not knowing to whom they should turn to for help. Nongovernmental organizations and lobby groups have been raising awareness and encourage different stakeholders to take action.
Some tech companies, such as Facebook, use Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to monitor hate speech. However, Artificial Intelligence may not always be an effective way of monitoring hate speech since the systems lack emotion and judgment skills that humans have. For example, a user might post or comment something that classifies as hate speech and/or violates community guidelines, but if the target word is misspelled, or some letters are replaced with symbols, the AI systems will not recognize it. Therefore, humans still have to monitor the AI systems that monitor hate speech, which is a concept referred to as "Automation's Last Mile."
Frameworks.
"Stormfront" Precedent.
In the aftermath of 2014's dramatic incidents, calls for more restrictive or intrusive measures to contain the Internet's potential to spread hate and violence are common, as if the links between online and offline violence were well known. On the contrary, as the following example indicates, appearances may often be deceiving. Stormfront is considered the first "hate website." Launched in March 1995 by a former Ku Klux Klan leader, it quickly became a popular space for discussing ideas related to Neo-Nazism, White nationalism and White separatism, first in the United States of America and then globally. The forum hosts calls for a racial holy war and incitement to use violence to resist immigration. and is considered a space for recruiting activists and possibly coordinating violent acts. The few studies that have explored the identities of Stormfront actually are depict a more complex picture. Rather than seeing it as a space for coordinating actions. Well-known extreme right activists have accused the forum to be just a gathering for "keyboard warriors." One of them for example, as reported by De Koster and Houtman, stated, "I have read quite a few pieces around the forum, and it strikes me that a great fuss is made, whereas little happens. The section activism/politics itself is plainly ridiculous. [...] Not to mention the assemblies where just four people turn up." Even more revealing are some of the responses to these accusations provided by regular members of the website. As one of them argued, "Surely, I am entitled to have an opinion without actively carrying it out. [...] I do not attend demonstrations and I neither join a political party. If this makes me a keyboard warrior, that is all right. I feel good this way. [...] I am not ashamed of it." De Koster and Houtman surveyed only one national chapter of Stormfront and a non-representative sample of users, but answers like those above should at least invite to caution towards hypotheses connecting expressions and actions, even in spaces whose main function is to host extremist views. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a study in 2014 that found users of the site "were allegedly responsible for the murders of nearly 100 people in the preceding five years."
International Principles.
Hate speech is not explicitly mentioned in many international human rights documents and treaties, but it is indirectly called upon by some of the principles related to human dignity and freedom of expression. For example, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was drafted as a response to the atrocities of the World War II, contains the right to equal protection under the law in Article 7, which proclaims that: "All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination." The UDHR also states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."
The UDHR was decisive in setting a framework and agenda for human rights protection, but the Declaration is non-binding. A series of binding documents have been subsequently created to offer a more robust protection for freedom of expression and protection against discrimination. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) addresses hate speech and contains the right to freedom of expression in Article 19 and the prohibition of advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence in Article 20. Other more tailored international legal instruments contain provisions that have repercussions for the definition of hate speech and identification of responses to it, such as: the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1951), the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, ICERD (1969), and, to a lesser extent, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW (1981).
Hate speech and the ICCPR.
The ICCPR is the legal instrument most commonly referred to in debates on hate speech and its regulation, although it does not explicitly use the term "hate speech." Article 19, which is often referred to as part of the "core of the Covenant", provides for the right to freedom of expression. This sets out the right, and it also includes general strictures to which any limitation of the right must conform in order to be legitimate. Article 19 is followed by Article 20 that expressly limits freedom of expression in cases of "advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence." The decision to include this provision, which can be characterized as embodying a particular conceptualization of hate speech, has been deeply contested. The Human Rights Committee, the United Nations body created by the ICCPR to oversee its implementation, cognizant of the tension, has sought to stress that Article 20 is fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression. In the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It can legitimately be limited by states under restricted circumstances:
"3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals."
Between Article 19 (3) and Article 20, there is a distinction between optional and obligatory limitations to the right to freedom of expression. Article 19 (3) states that limitations on freedom of expression "may therefore be subject to certain restrictions", as long as they are provided by law and necessary to certain legitimate purposes. Article 20 states that any advocacy of (certain kinds of) hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence "shall be prohibited by law." Despite indications on the gravity of speech offenses that should be prohibited by law under Article 20, there remains complexity. In particular there is a grey area in conceptualizing clear distinctions between (i) expressions of hatred, (ii) expression that advocate hatred, and (iii) hateful speech that specifically constitutes incitement to the practical harms of discrimination, hostility or violence. While states have an obligation to prohibit speech conceived as "advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence", as consistent with Article 20 (2), how to interpret such is not clearly defined.
Other international legal instruments.
ICERD.
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which came into force in 1969, has also implications for conceptualizing forms of hate speech. The ICERD differs from the ICCPR in three respects. Its conceptualization of hate speech is specifically limited to speech that refers to race and ethnicity. It asserts in Article 4, paragraph (a), that state parties:
"Shall declare as an offense punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another color or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; This obligation imposed by the ICERD on state parties is also stricter than the case of Article 20 of the ICCPR covering the criminalization of racist ideas that are not necessarily inciting discrimination, hostility or violence."
An important difference is in the issue of intent. The concept of "advocacy of hatred" introduced in the ICCPR is more specific than discriminatory speech described in the ICERD, since it is taken to require consideration of the intent of author and not the expression in isolation—this is because "advocacy" is interpreted in the ICCPR as requiring the intent to sow hatred. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has actively addressed hate speech in its General Recommendation 29, in which the Committee recommends state parties to:
"(r) Take measures against any dissemination of ideas of caste superiority and inferiority or which attempt to justify violence, hatred or discrimination against descent-based communities; (s) Take strict measures against any incitement to discrimination or violence against the communities, including through the Internet; (t) Take measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent-based discrimination;"
These points, which reflect the ICERD's reference to the dissemination of expression, have significance for the Internet. The expression of ideas in some online contexts may immediately amount to spreading them. This is especially relevant for private spaces that have begun to play a public role, as in the case of many social networking platforms.
Genocide Convention.
Similarly to the ICERD, the Genocide Convention aims to protect groups defined by race, nationality or ethnicity, although it also extends its provisions to religious groups. When it comes to hate speech the Genocide Convention is limited only to acts that publicly incite to genocide, recognized as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", regardless of whether such acts are undertaken in peacetime or in wartime. Specifically gender-based hate speech (as distinct from discriminatory actions) is not covered in depth in international law.
CEDAW.
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1981, imposes obligations on states to condemn discrimination against women and "prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish" acts of gender-based violence.
Regional responses.
Most regional instruments do not have specific articles prescribing prohibition of hate speech, but they more generally allow states to limit freedom of expression—which provisions can be applied to specific cases.
American Convention on Human Rights.
The American Convention on Human Rights describes limitations on freedom of expression in a manner similar to the ICCPR in Article 19 (3). The Organization of American States has also adopted another declaration on the principles of freedom of expression, which includes a specific clause stating that "prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or impartiality is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments." The Inter-American Court has advised that "(a)buse of freedom of information thus cannot be controlled by preventive measures but only through the subsequent imposition of sanctions on those who are guilty of the abuses." The Court also imposes a test for States willing to enact restrictions on freedom of expression, as they need to observe the following requirements: "a) the existence of previously established grounds for liability; b) the express and precise definition of these grounds by law; c) the legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved; d) a showing that these grounds of liability are ‘necessary to ensure' the aforementioned ends." The Inter-American System has a Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression who conducted a comprehensive study on hate speech. He concluded that the Inter-American Human Rights System differs from the United Nations and the European approach on a key point: The Inter-American system covers and restricts hate speech that actually leads to violence, and solely such speech can be restricted.
African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights.
The African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights takes a different approach in Article 9 (2), allowing for restrictions on rights as long as they are "within the law." This concept has been criticized and there is a vast amount of legal scholarship on the so-called "claw-back" clauses and their interpretation. The criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that countries can manipulate their own legislation and weaken the essence of the right to freedom of expression. The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa elaborates a higher standard for limitations on freedom of expression. It declares that the right "should not be restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression."
Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam.
In 1990, the Organization of the Islamic Conference (which was later renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OIC) adopted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (CDHRI), which calls for criminalization of speech that extends beyond cases of imminent violence to encompass "acts or speech that denote manifest intolerance and hate."
Arab Charter on Human Rights.
The Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was adopted by the Council of the League of Arab States in 2004, includes in Article 32 provisions that are relevant also for online communication as it guarantees the right to "freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, regardless of geographical boundaries." It allows a limitation on a broad basis in paragraph 2 "Such rights and freedoms shall be exercised in conformity with the fundamental values of society."
ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.
The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration includes the right to freedom of expression in Article 23. Article 7 of the Declaration provides for general limitations, affirming, "the realization of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds."
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which declares the right to freedom of expression in Article 11, has a clause which prohibits abuse of rights. It asserts that the Charter must not be interpreted as implying any "limitation to a greater extent than is provided for therein." An example of a limitation which implies a strict test of necessity and proportionality is the provision on freedom of expression in the European Convention on Human Rights, which underlines that the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities. It "may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary."
The European Court of Human Rights is careful to distinguish between hate speech and the right of individuals to express their views freely, even if others take offense. There are regional instances relevant specifically to online hate speech. The Council of Europe (CoE) in 2000 issued a General Policy Recommendation on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Anti-Semitic Material via the Internet. The creation of the CoE Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, which regulates mutual assistance regarding investigative powers, provides signatory countries with a mechanism to deal with computer data, which would include transnational hate speech online. In 2003 the CoE launched an additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime which addresses online expression of racism and xenophobia. The convention and its protocol were opened for signature and ratification of countries outside Europe, and other countries, such as Canada and South Africa, are already part of this convention. The Protocol imposes an obligation on Member States to criminalize racist and xenophobic insults online of "(i) persons for the reason that they belong to a group distinguished by race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics."
Private spaces.
Internet intermediaries such as social networking platforms, Internet Service Providers or Search Engines, stipulate in their terms of service how they may intervene in allowing, restricting, or channelling the creation and access to specific content. A vast amount of online interactions occur on social networking platforms that transcend national jurisdictions and which platforms have also developed their own definitions of hate speech and measures to respond to it. For a user who violates the terms of service, the content he or she has posted may be removed from the platform, or its access may be restricted to be viewed only by a certain category of users (e.g. users living outside a specific country).
The principles that inspire terms of service agreements and the mechanisms that each company develops to ensure their implementation have significant repercussions on the ability that people have to express themselves online as well as to be protected from hate speech. Most intermediaries have to enter in negotiations with national governments to an extent that varies according to the type of intermediary, areas where the company is registered, and the legal regime that applies. As Tsesis explains, "(i)f transmissions on the Internet are sent and received in particular locations, then specific fora retain jurisdiction to prosecute illegal activities transacted on the Internet." Internet Service Providers are the most directly affected by national legislation because they have to be located in a specific country to operate. Search Engines, while they can modify search results for self-regulatory or commercial reasons, have increasingly tended to adapt to the intermediary liability regime of both their registered home jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which they provide their services, either removing links to content proactively or upon request by authorities.
All Internet intermediaries operated by private companies are also expected to respect human rights. This is set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights elaborated by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The document emphasizes corporate responsibility in upholding human rights. In principle 11, it declares that: "Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved." The United Nations Guiding Principles also indicate that in cases in which human rights are violated, companies should "provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes." In the case of Internet intermediaries and conceptions of hate speech, this means that they should ensure that measures are in place to provide a commensurate response.
Social responses.
Case studies.
The American Trends Panel.
Pew Research Center surveyed over 10,000 adults in July 2020 to study social media's effect on politics and social justice activism. 23% of respondents, who are adult social media users, reported that social media content has caused them to change their opinion, positively or negatively, on a political or social justice issue. 35% of those respondents cited the Black Lives Matter movement, police reform, and/or race relations. 18% of respondents reported a change of opinion on political parties, ideologies, politicians, and/or President Donald Trump. 9% of respondents cited social justice issues, such as LGBTQIA+ rights, feminism, immigration, etc. 8% of respondents changed their opinion on the COVID-19 pandemic, and 10% cited other opinions. Based on these results, social media plays an important role in influencing public opinion.
Media Manipulation and Disinformation Online.
A study conducted by researchers Alice Marwick and Rebecca Lewis observed media manipulation and explored how the alt-right marketed, networked, and collaborated to influence their controversial beliefs that could have potentially helped influence President Trump's victory in the 2016 election. Unlike mainstream media, the alt-right does not need to comply to any rules when it comes to influence and do not need to worry about network ratings, audience reviews, or sensationalism. Alt-right groups can share and persuade others of their controversial beliefs as bluntly and brashly as they desire, on any platform, which may have played a role in the 2016 election. Although the study could not conclude what exactly the effect was on the election, but did provide extensive research on the characteristics of media manipulation and trolling.
Hate Speech and Linguistic Profiling in Online Gaming.
Professor and gamer Kishonna Gray studied intersectional oppressions in the online gaming community and called on Microsoft and game developers to "critically assess the experiences of non-traditional gamers in online communities...recognize diversity...[and that] the default gaming population are deploying hegemonic whiteness and masculinity to the detriment of non-white and/or non-male users within the space." Gray examined sexism and racism in the online gaming community. Gamers attempt to identify the gender, sexuality, and ethnic background of their teammates and opponents through linguistic profiling, when the other players cannot be seen. Due to the intense atmosphere of the virtual gaming sphere, and the inability to not be seen, located, or physically confronted, gamers tend to say things on the virtual game that they likely would not have said in a public setting. Many gamers of marginalized communities have branched off from the global gaming network and joined "clans," that consist of only gamers of the same gender, sexuality, and/or ethnic identity, to avoid discrimination while gaming. A study found that 78 percent of all online gamers play in "guilds" which are smaller groups of players, similar to "clans." One of the most notable "clans," Puerto Reekan Killaz, have created an online gaming space where Black and Latina women of the LGBTQIA+ community can play without risk of racism, nativism, homophobia, sexism, and sexual harassment.
In addition to hate speech, Professor and gamer Lisa Nakamura found that many gamers have experienced identity tourism- which is when a person or group appropriate and pretend to members of another group- as Nakamura observed white male gamers play as Japanese "geisha" women. Identity Tourism often leads to stereotyping, discrimination, and cultural appropriation. Nakamura called on the online gaming community to recognize Cybertyping- "the way the Internet propagates, disseminates, and commodifies images of race and racism."
Anti-Chinese Rhetoric Employed by Perpetrators of Anti-Asian Hate.
As of August 2020, over 2,500 Asian-Americans have reported experiencing racism fueled by COVID-19, with 30.5% of those cases containing anti-Chinese rhetoric, according to Stop AAPI (Asian-American/Pacific Islander) Hate. The language used in these incidents are divided into five categories: virulent animosity, scapegoating of China, anti-immigrant nativism, racist characterizations of Chinese, and racial slurs. 60.4% of these reported incidents fit into the virulent animosity category, which includes phrases such as "get your Chinese a** away from me!"
Myanmar.
The Internet has grown at unprecedented rates. Myanmar is transitioning towards greater openness and access, which leads to social media negatives, such as using hate speech and calls to violence. In 2014, the UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her concern over the spread of misinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence, discrimination and hostility in the media and Internet, particularly targeted against a minority community. The growing tension online has gone parallel with cases of actual violence leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced. One challenge in this process has concerned ethnic and religious minorities. In 2013, 43 people were killed due to clashes that erupted after a dispute in the Rakhine state in the Western Part of the country. A year earlier, more than 200 people were killed and thousands displaced 37 because of ethnic violence, which erupted after an alleged rape case. Against this backdrop, the rapid emergence of new online spaces, albeit for a fraction of the population, has reflected some of these deeply rooted tensions in a new form.
Dealing with intolerance and hate speech online is an emerging issue. Facebook has rapidly become the platform of choice for those citizens making their first steps online. In this environment there have been individual and groups, which have championed a more aggressive use of the medium, especially when feeling protected by a sense of righteousness and by claims to be acting in defense of the national interest. Political figures have also used online media for particular causes. In social media, there has been the use of derogatory terms in reference to minorities. In this complex situation, a variety of actors has begun to mobilize, seeking to offer responses that can avoid further violence. Facebook has sought to take a more active role in monitoring the uses of the social network platform in Myanmar, developing partnerships with local organizations and making guidelines on reporting problems accessible in Burmese.
The local civil society has constituted a strong voice in openly condemning the spread of online hate speech, but at the same time calling for alternatives to censorship. Among the most innovative responses has been Panzagar, which in Burmese means "flower speech", a campaign launched by blogger and activist Nay Phone Latt to openly oppose hate speech. The goal of the initiative was offering a joyful example of how people can interact, both online and offline. Local activists have been focussed upon local solutions, rather than trying to mobilize global civil society on these issues. This is in contrast to some other online campaigns that have been able to attract the world's attention towards relatively neglected problems. Initiatives such as those promoted by the Save Darfur Coalition for the civil war in Sudan, or the organization Invisible Children with the Kony2012 campaign that denounced the atrocities committed by the Lord Resistance Army, are popular examples. As commentaries on these campaigns have pointed out, such global responses may have negative repercussions on the ability for local solutions to be found.
Ethiopia.
The long-lived ethnic rivalry in Ethiopia between the Oromo people and the Amhara people found battleground on Facebook, leading to hate speech, threats, disinformation, and even deaths. Facebook does not have fact-checkers that speak either of the dominant languages spoken in Ethiopia nor do they provide translations of the Community Standards, therefore hate speech on Facebook is largely unmonitored in Ethiopia. Instead, Facebook relies on activists to flag potential hate speech and disinformation, but the many burnout activists feel mistreated.
In October 2019, Ethiopian activist Jawar Mohammed falsely announced on Facebook that the police were going to detain him, citing religious and ethnic tension. This prompted the community to protest his alleged detainment and the racial and ethnic tensions, which lead to over 70 deaths.
A disinformation campaign originated on Facebook centering on popular Ethiopian singer, Hachalu Hundessa, of the Oromo ethnic group. The posts accused Hundessa of supporting their controversial Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, whom Oromo nationalists disproved of for his catering to other ethnic groups. Hundessa was assassinated in June 2020 following these hateful Facebook posts, prompting public outrage. Facebook users blamed the Amhara people for Hundessa's assassination without any evidence in a long thread of hateful content. According to The Network Against Hate Speech, many Facebook posts called for “genocidal attacks against an ethnic group or a religion — or both at the same time; and ordering people to burn civilians’ properties, kill them brutally, and displace them." The violence in the streets and on Facebook escalated to the point that the Ethiopian Government had to shut down the Internet for three weeks. However, neighboring countries could still post and access the hateful content of the matter, and the volunteer activists could not access the Internet to flag hate speech. Therefore “there are hours of video that came from the diaspora community, extremist content, saying we need to exterminate this ethnic group,” according to Professor Endalk Chala of Hamline University.
Facebook officials ventured to Ethiopia to investigate, but did not release their findings. Facebook announced that they are hiring moderators who can speak Amharic and other languages in Ethiopia but did not provide extensive detail.
Private companies.
Internet intermediaries have developed disparate definitions of hate speech and guidelines to regulate it. Some companies do not use the term hate speech, but have a descriptive list of terms related to it.
Yahoo!
Yahoo!'s terms of service prohibit the posting of "content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libellous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable."
Twitter.
In December 2017, Twitter began enforcing new policies towards hate speech, banning multiple accounts as well as setting new guidelines for what will be allowed on their platform. There is an entire page in the Twitter Help Center devoted to describing their Hateful Conduct Policy, as well as their enforcement procedures. The top of this page states "Freedom of expression means little if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. We do not tolerate behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person’s voice. If you see something on Twitter that violates these rules, please report it to us." Twitter's definition of hate speech ranges from "violent threats" and "wishes for the physical harm, death, or disease of individuals or groups" to "repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone."
Punishments for violations range from suspending a user's ability to tweet until they take down their offensive/ hateful post to the removal of an account entirely. In a statement following the implementation of their new policies, Twitter said "In our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process" . . . "We’ll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks, and will keep you posted on progress along the way". These changes come amidst a time where action is being taken to prevent hate speech around the globe, including new laws in Europe which pose fines for sites unable to address hate speech reports within 24 hours.
YouTube.
YouTube, a subsidiary of the tech company Google, allows for easy content distribution and access for any content creator, which creates opportunity for the audience to access content that shifts right or left of the 'moderate' ideology common in mainstream media. YouTube provides incentives to popular content creators, prompting some creators to optimize the YouTuber experience and post shock-valued content that may promote extremist, hateful ideas. Content diversity and monetization on YouTube directs a broad audience to the potentially harmful content from extremists. YouTube allows creators to personally brand themselves, making it easy for young subscribers to form a parasocial relationship with them and act as "regular" customers. In 2019, YouTube demonetized political accounts, but radical content creators still have their channels and subscribers to keep them culturally relevant and financially afloat.
YouTube has outlined a clear "Hate Speech Policy" amidst several other user policies on their website. The policy is worded as such: "We encourage free speech and try to defend your right to express unpopular points of view, but we don't permit hate speech. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes, such as: race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation/gender identity". YouTube has built in a user reporting system in order to counteract the growing trend of hate speech. Among the most popular deterrents against hate speech, users are able to anonymously report another user for content they deem inappropriate. The content is then reviewed against YouTube policy and age restrictions, and either taken down or left alone.
Facebook.
Facebook's terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that "Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases." It further states that "We allow humour, satire or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content."
Instagram, a photo and video-sharing platform owned by Facebook, has similar hate speech guidelines as Facebook, but is not divided in tiers. Instagram's Community Guidelines also forbid misinformation, nudity, self-injury glorification, and posting copyrighted content without authorization.
Facebook's hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers, as well as many Artificial Intelligence monitors. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However, only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments. In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, "We’re sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build…We must do better." 
There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's hate speech policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes. For example, the statement "Female sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks," would not be considered hate speech on Facebook's platform and therefore would not be removed. While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation.
Facebook has been accused of holding bias when policing hate speech, citing political campaign ads that may promote hate or misinformation that have made an impact on the platform. Facebook adjusted their policies after receiving backlash, accusations, and large corporations pulled their ads from the platform to protest the platform's loose handling of hate speech and misinformation. As of 2020, political campaign ads have a "flag" feature that notes that the content is newsworthy but that it may violate some community guidelines. 
Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content. When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content's severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys "violent speech or support for death/disease/harm." Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies.
In March 2019, Facebook banned content supporting white nationalism and white separatism, extending a previous ban of white supremacy content. In May 2019, it announced bans on several prominent people for violations of its prohibition on hate speech, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen.
In 2020, Facebook added guidelines to Tier 1 that forbid blackface, racial comparisons to animals, racial or religious stereotypes, denial of historical events, and objectification of women and the LGBTQIA+ community.
Hate Speech on Facebook and Instagram quadrupled in 2020, leading to the removal of 22.5 million posts on Facebook and 3.3 million posts on Instagram in the second quarter of 2020 alone.
Microsoft.
Microsoft has specific rules concerning hate speech for a variety of its applications. Its policy for mobile phones prohibits applications that "contain any content that advocates discrimination, hatred, or violence based on considerations of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, status as a veteran, or membership in any other social group." The company has also rules regarding online gaming, which prohibit any communication that is indicative of "hate speech, controversial religious topics and sensitive current or historical events."
TikTok.
TikTok lacks clear guidelines and control on hate speech, which allows bullying, harassment, propaganda, and hate speech to become part of normal discourse on TikTok. Far-right hate groups, terrorist organizations, and pedophiles thrive on TikTok by spreading and encouraging hate to an audience as young as 13 years old. Children are naive and easily influenced by other people and messages, therefore they are more likely to listen and repeat what they are being shown or told. The Internet does not have an excessively monitored space that guarantees safety for children, so as long as the internet is public, children and teenagers are bound to come across hate speech. From there, young teenagers have a tendency to let their curiosity lead them into furthering their interest and research into radical ideas.
However, children cannot take accountability for their actions in the way that adults can and should, placing the blame on not only the person who posted the vulgar content, but the social media platform itself. Therefore, TikTok is criticized for their handling of hate speech on the platform. While TikTok prohibits bullying, harassment, and any vulgar or hateful speech in its Terms &amp; Conditions, TikTok has not been active long enough to have developed an effective method to monitor this content. Other social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook have been active long enough to know how to battle online hate speech and vulgar content, but the audience on those platforms are old enough to take accountability for the messages they spread.
TikTok, on the other hand, has to take some responsibility for the content distributed to its young audience. TikTok users are required to be of at least 13 years of age, however that requirement can be easily waived, as apps cannot physically access users' age. Researcher Robert Mark Simpson concluded that combatting hate speech on youth-targeted media "might bear more of a resemblance to regulations governing adult entertainment than to prohibitions on Holocaust denial."
Media and Information Literacy.
Media and Information Literacy aims to help people to engage in a digital society by being able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically; while being able to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.
Citizenship education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict. One of its main objectives is raising awareness on the political, social and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including freedom of speech and the responsibilities and social implications that emerge from it. The concern of citizenship education with hate speech is twofold: it encompasses the knowledge and skills to identify hate speech, and should enable individuals to counteract messages of hatred. One of its current challenges is adapting its goals and strategies to the digital world, providing not only argumentative but also technological knowledge and skills that a citizen may need to counteract online hate speech.
Information literacy cannot avoid issues such as rights to free expression and privacy, critical citizenship and fostering empowerment for political participation. Multiple and complementary literacies become critical. The emergence of new technologies and social media has played an important role in this shift. Individuals have evolved from being only consumers of media messages to producers, creators and curator of information, resulting in new models of participation that interact with traditional ones, like voting or joining a political party. Teaching strategies are changing accordingly, from fostering critical reception of media messages to include empowering the creation of media content.
The concept of media and information literacy itself continues to evolve, being augmented by the dynamics of the Internet. It is beginning to embrace issues of identity, ethics and rights in cyberspace. Some of these skills can be particularly important when identifying and responding to hate speech online.
Series of initiatives aimed both at providing information and practical tools for Internet users to be active digital citizens:
Education is also seen as being a tool against hate speech. Laura Geraghty from the ‘No Hate Speech Movement' affirmed: "Education is key to prevent hate speech online. It is necessary to raise awareness and empower people to get online in a responsible way; however, you still need the legal background and instruments to prosecute hate crimes, including hate speech online, otherwise the preventive aspect won't help."

Anne Worsley

Anne Worsley religious name Anne of the Ascension (1588 – 1644) was an English nun. She was the founding prioress of the English Carmelite convent in Antwerp.
Life.
Worsley's parents were John and Eleanor (born Hervey) Worsley. Her father had lived on the Isle of Wight. They were persecuted because they were Roman Catholics and they went into exile in the low countries. Anne decided on a religious life at the age of fifteen when she was living abroad. She decided to be a nun and opted for the Carmelites. This was not unusual, her cousin Edward Worsley was a Jesuit and three of her siblings Thomas, William and Elizabeth became a Jesuit, a priest and a nun respectively. She initially chosen to become a poor Clare but her mother said the life was too austere so the Carmelites gained a novice.
She was the founding prioress of the English Carmelite convent in Antwerp where her first novice was younger sister Theresa. She had visited Antwerp with her mentor Anne of Saint Bartholomew and other sources attribute the leadership of the Antwerp convent to her until she died in 1626. She had been separated from her mentor Anne of St Bartholomew and so when Mary Lovel created a new English Carmel in Antwerp she transferred. The new organisation was established in May 1619 and her initial unhappiness was compounded when she was elected prioress just five weeks after her arrival. The exiled recusant Mary Lovel was not always pleased with the way Anne organised the new convent and she found the management difficult. Lovel would speak outside of the convent against it management. In 1622 Lovel returned to England to raise more funds and when she returned she was livid that two Flemish nuns had joined the community. Lovel threatened to cease her funding so the Flemish nuns had to be ejected. Lovel effectively left the convent in 1625.
Worsley died in 1644.

London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwaymen, Maritime and Transport Staff

London Underground Ltd v National Union of Railwaymen, Maritime and Transport Staff [1996] ICR 170 is a UK labour law case, concerning the right to strike.
The case is also notable as Millett LJ stated in the course of his judgment that:
Facts.
London Underground Ltd claimed an injunction from the RMT making new members support a strike after a ballot had been taken. The RMT called on members to strike and notified employers under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 section 226A it would hold a ballot, gave them a list of 5000 union members under s 234A. The ballot was 4-7 August, 2000 members voted in favour, 622 against. It notified the result under s 234A, with a strike called from 25 August to 4 September. Twenty members had since joined. Mance J held the union had no statutory immunity for any inducements to the 69s members who joined after the ballot, but did not lose immunity for the whole strike. The union appealed. 
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal held there was full immunity. Under TULRCA 1992 s 226 a union had statutory immunity from suit for inducing any members to strike where it was supported under TULRCA 1992 ss 226–232. The strike itself had to have support of a ballot, not an individual itself taking part, so if a majority were in favour the strike was lawful and no immunity was lost for inducement of new members joining after the strike ballot.
Millett LJ said the following.

Adamson Mushala

Adamson Bratson Musanda Mushala was a Zambian rebel leader who rebelled against the rule of the Zambian government of Kenneth Kaunda from 1975 to 1982 when he was shot by Zambia Army officers.
Rebellion.
Before his rebellion, Mushala initially belonged to the United National Independence Party (UNIP), fighting colonial minority rule. He was sent to China for guerrilla training with a view to coming back to fight the colonial government, but upon his return, Zambia was already independent. He demanded to be the Minister Of Tourism and Wildlife in the UNIP government, which Kaunda denied. Out of frustration, he left Zambia together with his followers and went to the then South West Africa (Namibia) under the control of South Africa. He advanced in his guerrilla training and in 1975, after inspiration from Jonas Savimbi of Angola, he came back to Zambia and rebelled against the UNIP government until 1982.
It was believed that Mushala was strongly believed to be surviving through a complexity of witchcraft and supernatural powers. There were some unconfirmed reports in Solwezi that the government had even hired some witchdoctors locally and abroad, to come and try to capture him but all was in vain.
Death.
Adamson Mushala was gunned down in 1982 in a military ambush in the remote areas of Northwestern Province near Solwezi, where his rebellion began with a post-independence dispute in the 1960s and ended with a bullet through his eye.
His body was paraded for public viewing at Solwezi General Hospital.
Aftermath.
After the death of Mushala, his second-in-command Alexander Saimbwende took over the reins and continued the fight until September 25, 1990, when he gave up after a dialogue with the then Member of the Central Committee for North Western Province Alexander Kamalondo. He was flown to Lusaka where he was later pardoned by President Dr. Kenneth Kaunda.

Euphorbia "×" martini, or Martin’s spurge, is a hybrid between two species of flowering plant, "E. amygdaloides" × "E. characias" subsp. "characias"
in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. It was found growing wild in southern France. Growing to tall and broad, it is a dwarf evergreen subshrub with narrow grey-green leaves and in late spring and early summer, sprays of lime green flowers, often with a red or maroon eye. It is useful as a spreading, weed-smothering groundcover. Though hardy down to , it is a Mediterranean plant best grown in a sheltered spot in well-drained soil in full sun.
All parts of the plant are toxic if eaten, moreover euphorbias produce an irritant milky sap when cut or broken.

Morgan v Fry [1968] 2 QB 710 is a UK labour law case, concerning the right to strike at common law.
It is notable as Lord Denning MR said the following: 
Facts.
The Port of London Authority negotiated with a single union. Morgan, a lockman, was a member of a breakaway union. The first union threatened to strike unless the breakaway union members were dismissed, Fry arguing it was a genuine threat to industrial peace. He did not intend for anyone to be dismissed in particular. Morgan was dismissed because of the threat, and sued for intimidation and conspiracy. 
Judgment.
Lord Denning MR held that if proper notice, the length of time to terminate a contract, was given then a strike was lawful, and because the strike was lawful there was no tort of intimidation. The defendants’ honest belief they were acting in the interests of the union negatived any allegation of conspiracy. 
Lord Denning MR said the following.

Ashok Leyland FAT 6×6

The Ashok Leyland FAT 6×6 is an all-terrain military truck developed and produced by Indian automobile manufacturer Ashok Leyland. Designed for towing heavy artillery guns, it will replace the aging fleet of Scania SBAT111S used by the Indian Army.
Development.
In 1986, when the Indian Army purchased 410 FH77B Bofors howitzers, they also ordered 660 SBAT111S trucks. 30 years later, these trucks had become obsolete and the Army looked for a replacement.
Ashok Leyland is one of the biggest suppliers of logistics vehicles to Indian Army; the company's Stallion truck has over 60,000 units in service with Indian Army. Thus, the development of FAT or Field Artillery Tractor was started as a private venture to replace the ageing fleet of Scania trucks.
Design &amp; features.
The truck is designed on Leyland's "Super Stallion" platform. It is powered by Ashok Leyland's in-house developed 8-litre Neptune series engine that gives of power and 1,400 Nm of torque at 1,300 rpm. This is mated to an 8-speed manual transmission (2-speed transfer case). The truck runs on full-time 6-wheel drive system with all axles having differential lock.
The FAT 6x6's towing capacity is rated at 8 tonnes. The driver's cabin can hold four people and the crew cabin just behind it can hold six. The cargo bay is fitted with a 2.7 tonne crane for loading/unloading ammunition and other equipment. There is a roof hatch
for observation, emergency exit and firing. At the front, the truck has a 10 tonne self-recovery winch.
Other features include a fire and smoke detection unit, an infrared rear-view camera and central tire inflation system. For driver's comfort, cab is equipped with HVAC.
Production.
In March 2016, Ashok Leyland won a contract for supplying 450 units of the FAT 6x6 along with other "Super Stallion" vehicles and 825 units of "Ambulance 4x4" to the army. The total order was worth ₹800 crore. In 2017, the first batch of trucks was delivered.

Italian frigate Alpino (F 580)

Alpino was a frigate operated by the Italian Navy during the Cold War.
Design.
The was designed by CNR in Riva Trigoso and named after types of soldiers and specifically after two World War II s. The design was authorised in the 1959/1960 Italian naval programme but was radically redesigned in 1962. "Circe" was laid down as the lead ship in 1963 but was renamed "Alpino" in June 1965 prior to being launched in 1967.
As originally designed, "Alpino" was to have armament based on the preceding . Optimised for anti-submarine warfare, the vessels were designed around a hangar for an Agusta-Bell AB.204 helicopter, complemented by a single-barrel Menon mortar mounted forward. An early drawing shows the hangar straddled by a pair of guns with a single gun mounted fore and aft to provide anti-aircraft defence. By 1962, the efficacy of the 40 mm was in doubt and the design was redrawn with three 76 mm guns, but this was deemed insufficient. At launch, the vessel had no less than six single mounts.
The propulsion system uses a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) system first trialled on the destroyer "San Giorgio". The system allied two diesels and one gas turbine per shaft with a hydraulic coupling to enable the vessel to either run on diesel power alone, at low speed, or diesels, at high speed, and gas turbines simultaneously. Two Tosi OTV-320 diesels were paired with each Tosi-Metrovick G.6 gas turbine to provide a maximum speed of on diesels alone and with all engines running.
Service.
Commissioned on 14 January 1968, "Alpino" quickly made a mark as a pioneer of sharply raked bows, the first frigates so equipped in Italian Navy service, as well as gas turbines and variable depth sonar. Between 14 January and 6 June 1973, the ship undertook the longest continuous voyage in the Italian Navy, covering and travelling as far as the Labrador Sea, for which it was awarded a symbolic Blue Nose.
"Alpino" acted as the trial ship for the experimental SPQ-5A Sarchiapone radar between 1973 and 1987. It was reportedly able to locate aircraft during their take-off from the aircraft carrier at a distance of .
A SLQ-A ECM system was also added during the 1970s. This was subsequently upgraded to SLQ-D. Consideration was also given to installing the Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile system to improve anti-aircraft capability.
The ship was further upgraded during a refit that ended in June 1985. Hull-mounted sonar was fitted and the variable depth sonar rendered inoperable.
Mine warfare flagship.
Between 14 April 1996 and 31 January 1997, "Alpino" was converted into the flagship for minewarfare, a mine countermeasures support ship, a combat diver support ship and signals intelligence ship with the new penant number A5384. The vessel acted in the flagship role to the "Gaeta"-class minehunters "Crotone" and "Chioggia" from 18 March to 22 June 2002 during a NATO training exercise in Northern Europe. From 13 May 2004, "Alpino" commanded MCMFORSOUTH while on exercise in the Black Sea.
Thirty-eight years after being originally commissioned, the ship was decommissioned on 31 March 2006.

Isabelle Druet

Isabelle Druet (born 19 September 1979) is a French operatic coloratura mezzo-soprano who has performed internationally. She began her career as an actress and co-founded a theatre company, La Carotte. She has performed in concert and recorded with the ensemble Le Poème Harmonique. On stage, she has performed at opera houses in Paris, Nancy, Lyon and Düsseldorf, among others.
Career.
Born in Niort (Deux-Sèvres), Druet started as an actress, taking theatre courses in high school in Salins-les-Baths. She then pursued a "Diplôme d'études universitaires scientifiques et techniques" (DEUST) (Diploma of scientific and technical university studies) degree in Besançon, studying at the University of Franche-Comté. Though she sang in the university choir, her musical preferences were for reggae and Indian music. In 2000, she co-founded a theatre company based in Besançon, La Carotte, where theatre, mime, music, dance and storytelling performances were mixed. Torn between theatre and music, she finally moved to Paris and studied music for two years in the 7th arrondissement before entering the National Conservatoire.
Studying voice at the Conservatoire de Paris, Druet graduated summa cum laude in 2007. She obtained a master's degree, writing a thesis, "La construction du personnage à l'opéra", and attending masterclasses with René Jacobs and Agnès Mellon, among others. In June 2007 she won a first prize in singing with unanimous praise from the jury at the Conservatoire in Isabelle Guillaud's class. That same year, she was elected in the category "Révélation classique lyrique" of the Adami. Simultaneously with her final two years at the Conservatoire, Druet performed in the Opéra-Comique, Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Théâtre du Châtelet, as well as at regional festivals. Among her roles were Zaïde in "Europa Galante" by André Campra under the direction of William Christie, which toured in 2005; playing the sorceress in "Dido and Aeneas", singing roles in "The Clemency of Titus", and playing in the Conservatoire's productions of "Eugène Onegin" as Mme Larina and in Handel's Alcina as Ruggiero, among many other performances.
In 2008, she was awarded second place in the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels, Belgium and sang at Carnegie Hall in New York City with the baroque ensemble, Les Arts Florissants under the direction of William Christie. The following year, she co-created with Marc Mauillon a presentation for the Emergence Festival. Premiering together, they performed "La Valse perdue" (The Lost Waltz) by Jacques Offenbach at the Musical Theater of Besançon. The duo continued to perform together, singing at the concert of the Revelations of Victories in 2010, when each of them were awarded the distinction of "laureate" in the Victoires de la musique classique. After touring throughout Europe, performing both operatic roles and singing baroque lyric concert music, Druet made her US orchestral debut performing with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in 2015. Combining music from two different composers, Argentine Alberto Ginastera and French Maurice Ravel, the concert under the direction of Leonard Slatkin was praised for the thoughtful presentation. Druet was praised for her passionate performance in Ravel's "Two Hebraic Melodies", based upon an Aramaic version of the Kaddish. Particularly noted was her performance in Ravel's "Sheharazade", for her "intelligent phrasing that was seemingly attuned to every nuance embedded in the text".
Opera.
In 2010, Druet performed the role of Arcabonne in Lully's "Amadis". In 2011, she appeared in the title role of Bizet's "Carmen" at both the opéra national de Lorraine in Nancy and at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf. She sang the title role of Rossini's "L'italiana in Algeri" in Metz. She appeared as Dido in Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas". Druet made her debut at the Paris Opera in 2011 as the Page in "Salome" by Richard Strauss. In 2013, she was Orphée in Gluck's "Orphée et Eurydice" in the revised version by Hector Berlioz at the , alongside Marion Tassou as Eurydice. She appeared as Concepción in Ravel's "L'heure espagnole" in Lyon, which was recorded, and as Baba Turk in Britten's "The Rake's Progress". She has appeared at the Paris Opera as Tisbe in Rossini's "La Cenerentola", as Annina in Verdi's "La traviata", and as Ciesca in Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi".
Concert.
Druet began performing with the ensemble Le Poème Harmonique, as the group allowed her to explore her interest in a variety of music styles. In 2010, she was featured in a production of "Cadmus et Hermione" by Lully at the Opéra Comique accompanied by Le Poème Harmonique and Vincent Dumestre. Druet appeared in concert with Le Poème Harmonique, performing and recording rarities such as music by Luis de Briceño and his contemporaries. In "Firenze 1616", they focused on Domenico Belli's "Orfeo dolente", and music of his time by Claudio Saracini, Giulio Caccini and Cristofano Malvezzi. She recorded Shakespeare Songs with pianist Anne Le Bozec, works inspired by characters from plays such as Juliet and Desdemona, including songs by Schubert, Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Korngold, the ballad "La mort d'Ophélie" by Saint-Saëns and "Five Ophelia Songs" by Brahms. A review notes her "fine, cultured voice", in four languages.

Neisseria sibling sRNAs NmsR/RcoF

NmsRA and NmsRB (Neisseria metabolic switch regulator), RcoF1 and RcoF2 (RNA regulating colonization factor) as well as NgncR_162 and NgncR_163 (Neisseria gonorrhoeae non-coding RNA) are all names of neisserial sibling small regulatory RNAs described and independently named in three publications. NmsRB/RcoF1/NgncR_163 was shown to be the predominant sibling. The sRNAs are tandemly arranged, structurally nearly identical and share 70% sequence identity. They translationally down-regulate genes involved in basic metabolic processes including tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and amino acid uptake and degradation. The target genes include: "fumC", "sdhC", "gltA", "sucC", "prpB" and "prpC". The expression of the sRNAs is presumably under the control of RelA, as shown for "N. meningitidis". Furthermore, the sRNAs interact with Hfq protein and target repression of putative colonization factor of the human nasopharynx PrpB mRNA, hence one of the proposed names is RNA regulating colonization factor.

Laguna Miñiques

Miñiques is the name of a lake and a volcano in Chile. It lies south of Laguna Miscanti and at the foot of the Cerro Miscanti volcano. The lake is fed from Laguna Miscanti by seepage and its waters are brackish.
Lake.
Laguna Miñiques lies at an altitude of and is a lake with a surface area of . It is a fault-bound lake like Laguna Miscanti and Laguna Lejia farther north, and receives inflow from Laguna Miscanti by seepage; a lava flow separates Laguna Miñiques from Laguna Miscanti. Like Miscanti, the waters of Laguna Miñiques are brackish. 
Biology.
The cladocerans "Alona pulchella" and "Daphnia", the copepods "Boeckella poopoensis" and unidentified species of cyclopoida inhabit the lake. The lake is part of the Los Flamencos National Reserve and a tourism destination.
Climate.
The regional climate is dry and influenced by the Atacama Desert in that regard, although the summits of the Western Cordillera have higher precipitation amounts, especially towards the north such as at Parinacota. The dry climate restrains the development of glaciers in favour of a terrain that is influenced by periglacial processes. Presently, the average precipitation on Laguna Miñiques is about and the annual temperature averages .
During the Pleistocene and earliest Holocene however increased precipitation resulted in advances of glaciers and in the growth of lakes. In the case of Miñiques, the lakes Miscanti and Pampa Varela (now a dry lake) farther south became connected; a stream delta at Miñiques goes back to that time.

Dry's Bluff

Dry's Bluff is a mountain in the Great Western Tiers Range in Tasmania. The walk to its summit is listed in The Abels as one of the hardest day walks in Tasmania with an elevation gain of over 1000m from the base of the plateau. Access to the start of the walk is through Bob Brown's residence Oura Oura which has the sign "Trespassers Welcome" on the gate.
History.
It is probably named after Richard Dry, the first Tasmanian-born Premier of Tasmania, and son of Richard Dry Snr. an Irish political convict. Richard Dry Snr. was granted large amounts of land at Quamby Plains 30km north of the mountain.
Geography and geology.
Dry's Bluff lies just south of Liffey at the edge of the central plateau and its summit is above sea level. It is made of Jurassic dolerite columns which are characteristic of the Great Western Tiers.
Access.

Limenitis doerriesi

Limenitis doerriesi is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Amur (Khabarovsk), Ussuri, Northeast China, Korea) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
"L. doerriesi" Stgr. (57b only male* [the depicted female is "Limenitis helmanni" ab."duplicata" Staudinger] ), 61d female (see gallery)) is so extremely similar to the preceding ["L. helmanni"] that there is justification for doubting the specific distinctness. It has at the apex of the cell of the forewing a feeble reddish brown stripe (not represented in the figure), there being in the female occasionally also a reddish spot anteriorly in the centre of the cell. Near the distal margin of both wings, contiguous to a row of sharply marked small black spots, there are mostly also white elongate spots (absent from the figure of the male), which are not present in the anterior area of the forewing, but may be considerably enlarged at the centre of the distal margin. The white spots situated between the median veins of the forewing stand somewhat nearer the middle of the wing than in "duplicata" [form of "L. helmanni"] . The inner edge of the while band on the underside of the hindwing is said to afford an essential difference from "duplicata". This edge in "doerriesi" projects below the subcostal somewhat towards the distal margin , and is here as well as between the radials quite straight or feebly undulate (concave towards the base), while in "duplicata" the brownish portion of the basal area projects twice in arc-shape into the respectivewhite spots of the band. In the male the rest of the underside is almost as in "duplicata", the white band, however, is somewhat narrower and there are distinct black dots in the grey spots of the marginal area. In the rather larger female the outer area of the underside is more evenly ochreous, with white marginal lunules and a row of small elongate white spots in a narrow grey band; before each of these spots there is a black dot, the anal angle as in the male bearing a double dot. Amurland: Sutshan (Ussuri).

Blohm &amp; Voss P 184

The Blohm &amp; Voss P 184 was a German design for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft during World War II. Carrying a crew of five, it was of aerodynamically clean appearance and its wing had an unusually high aspect ratio.
Design.
Developed in 1943, the P 184 was a large, long-range reconnaissance and patrol landplane capable of superseding the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 "Condor". It was of conventional layout but, like many B&amp;V designs, of innovative structure using a high proportion of steel.
The fuselage nose was fully glazed to provide excellent vision to the crew, all accommodated in the nose cabin. Behind the cabin, the entire centre section of the fuselage formed one giant integral fuel tank. The tail housed a defensive gun turret and a single retractable tailwheel. Further defensive armament was provided by a remote-controlled barbette under the fuselage.
The mid-mounted wing was of very high aspect ratio, having a large span combined with a relatively short chord to make it highly efficient. Four identical nacelles, distributed along the constant-chord centre section of the wing, each housed a BMW 801E radial engine providing almost takeoff power, with a retractable main undercarriage leg behind. The outer wing sections had a slight taper. As with most B&amp;V designs, the main wing structure was an integral steel box which served as additional integral fuel tankage.

My Enemy (Chvrches song)

"My Enemy" is a song recorded by Scottish synthpop band Chvrches, featuring guest vocals from Matt Berninger of The National. Written and produced by the band, it was released through Glassnote on 28 February 2018, as the second single from their third studio album, "Love Is Dead" (2018).
Background and release.
Matt Berninger made a brief cameo in the music video for the album's lead single "Get Out". On 25 February 2018, "My Enemy" appeared on the music streaming platform Deezer for a short amount of time, as a screenshot of the song playing on Spotify surfaced on the internet. The song was confirmed when the band revealed the album's track list the day after. It premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show as the "World Record" of that day. Chvrches' front woman Lauren Mayberry praised Berninger's work the interview, stating that the band is "huge fans of the National and have been for a long time" and had played a few festivals together. They got to know each other while they were working on the 7 Inches For Planned Parenthood project that Berninger spearheaded. "We kept in touch after that and, when it came time to record 'My Enemy', Iain and Martin suggested I email Matt to see if he'd like to sing on it. We never realistically thought he'd have time to do it but he replied right away and recorded the track at his house the next day."
Multi-instrumentalist Martin Doherty told "Pitchfork" that he initially sang on the Berninger's verse. "We realized pretty quickly it would lend itself well to the duality of two points of view, once Lauren had come in with the lyric. But when my voice was on the verse, it felt somehow wrong to me. I thought we could make this into something special with someone like Matt, who can sell stories so purely, who sings one word and I'm there. The first time I ever heard 'Fake Empire' from "Boxer", I will never fucking forget that."
Critical reception.
Bianca Gracie of Fuse complimented Chvrches' ability to "effortlessly express tangible emotions in synth-pop", writing that the song has "a completely different tone" than "Get Out" and "leaves you feeling surprisingly empty, but satisfied enough to give it another play". Scott Russell of "Paste" sees the song as "another indication that Chvrches are aiming high on their new album, packing more punch than ever in their soaring synth-pop anthems". Brian Haack of Grammy Award praised the song, writing: "The resulting collaboration touches all the right notes of Chvrches trademark sound: it's lyrically lush and sonically layered enough to wow crowds at festival stages, but also packed with hooks and catchy vocal melodies that should play well on radio and streaming platforms."
Lauren O'Neill of "Vice" wrote: "It's airy, light, and more downbeat than its predecessor, and is especially significant as a different sonic landscape from the sort that we're used to from Berninger, who for the record sounds great here." Hayden Manders of "Nylon" opined that it is "decidedly more morose than 'Get Out', but cathartic nonetheless". He felt that "the song itself is somber, more in the vein of previous songs like 'Tether' and 'Down Side of Me.'" Robin Murray of "Clash" regarded it as "a record of both quiet and significant change for the Scottish group", calling it "a brooding, crystalline piece of synth pop" in which "every element feels exactly measured". Will Richards of "DIY" deemed it "a slower, more contemplative counterpart to the sky-reaching, ballsy 'Get Out'", writing that "Matt and Lauren's voices prove a near-perfect pair". He concluded his review by naming it "the first true example of the trio countering their chorus-driven, synth-pop bangers with something slower but just as affecting".

King &amp; Prince

King &amp; Prince is a five-member Japanese idol group under Johnny &amp; Associates that debuted in 2018. The group was originally a Johnny's Jr. unit, "Mr. King vs Mr. Prince" that was composed of 2 separate units: Mr. King and Prince. The units later performed as one group for TV Asahi's "Roppongi Hills Natsu Matsuri Summer Station" in June 2015. Their debut was announced at a press conference on 17 January 2018 along with the establishment of Johnny &amp; Associates' new record label under Universal Music, "Johnny's Universe", with King &amp; Prince becoming the first artists to sign under the label. They have sold more than 6.8 million physical copies in Japan. 
The group used to have six members: Sho Hirano, Ren Nagase, Kaito Takahashi, Yuta Kishi, Yuta Jinguji and Genki Iwahashi. However, Genki Iwahashi withdrew from King &amp; Prince and Johnny &amp; Associates on 31 March 2021 due to panic disorder.
History.
2015–2017: Beginnings.
Johnny &amp; Associates announced the group's formation in a press conference on 5 June 2015. The group was formed to be special supporters for TV Asahi's "Summer Station" event. Mr. King vs Mr. Prince was divided into two subgroups: "Mr. King", consisting of Sho Hirano, Ren Nagase, and Kaito Takahashi and "Mr. Prince", consisting of Yuta Kishi, Yuta Jinguji, and Genki Iwahashi. Producer Johnny Kitagawa chose their name in hopes that each member would "spark off each other" and "improve themselves through friendly rivalry". The group's first original song, "Summer Station" was used as the official theme song for the "Summer Station" event, which ran from July to August 2015. The group was meant to disband after the event. However, in August 2015, the members announced that they would continue activities as a group.
By 2016, Mr. Prince had changed their name to "Prince" and the six members predominately worked within their respective units. Mr. King released a photo book and were special supporters for "Summer Station 2016", while Prince performed in the "Johnny's Ginza" musical and started to host their own variety show, "Mayonaka no Prince". In September 2017, the six members performed in the Johnny's Jr. concert "Summer Sta (Kimi ga) King's Treasure". After the concert, they asked Johnny Kitagawa to let them debut together.
2018–present: Debut and success.
On 17 January 2018, their debut was announced in a press conference, along with the establishment of Johnny &amp; Associates' new record label under Universal Music, Johnny's Universe, with King &amp; Prince becoming the first artists to sign under the label. Their debut single "Cinderella Girl" was released on 23 May 2018. It was used as the theme song for the drama "Boys Over Flowers Season 2" which stars member Sho Hirano. "Cinderella Girl" was a commercial success; it sold over 577,000 copies in its first week, making it the first debut single in over 12 years to exceed initial sales of 500,000 copies. This also made it the most commercially successful debut of the decade. By late June King &amp; Prince had become the highest earning new artist, with a total gross of ¥870,000,000. In September 2018, "Cinderella Girl" was certified 3x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 750,000 units.
Following the success of "Cinderella Girl", King &amp; Prince embarked on a nationwide arena tour titled "King &amp; Prince First Concert Tour 2018". The tour began in August at the Yokohama Arena with a sold out show to 15,000 guests. When the tour concluded, the audience totaled about 260,000 fans. On 10 October 2018, King &amp; Prince released their second single titled "Memorial". The single was used as the theme song for the television drama "Bukatsu, Suki Janakya Dame Desu ka?" starring members Kaito Takahashi, Yuta Jinguji, and Genki Iwahashi. Another song included in the single, "High On Love", was used as the theme song for the film "You, I Love" which stars member Hirano. "Memorial" sold more than 400,000 copies in its first week, and topped the Oricon Singles Chart. In the same month of release, it was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAJ for shipments of 500,000 units.
In November 2018, Genki Iwahashi went on hiatus indefinitely to concentrate on treatment for his panic disorder. The group's management announced in February 2019 that he would rejoin the group and participate on their third single, "Kimi wo Matteru", but in March it was noted that he was to continue receiving treatment.
On 31 March 2021, Genki Iwahashi officially left King &amp; Prince and retired from the entertainment industry.

Finger heart

The finger heart gesture is a trend that was popularized in South Korea during the 2010s. The thumb and index finger of one hand are crossed to form a heart shape, and an invisible virtual heart is imagined above it.
Popular usage.
Before the appearance of finger hearts, it was common to make small hearts with two hands or to make large hearts by raising and curving both arms above the head. Conventionally, heart display using both hands and arms has been performed worldwide, but finger hearts are also called Korean Finger Hearts because they originated and became popular in South Korea.
Finger hearts got popularised by three celebrities, Korean actress Kim Hye-soo and K-pop artists Nam Woohyun and G-Dragon.
In South Korea, it is a known symbol among K-pop stars and their fans, and is popularly performed using the thumb and index finger. The thumb and index finger gesture has become popular across Asia due to the popularity of K-pop and Korean dramas, and increasingly so in other parts of the world as a factor of the Korean Wave.
During the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, The North Face provided gloves with highlighted thumb and index finger sleeves to highlight this symbol.

Peter Newton (winemaker)

Peter Leigh Newton (27 August 1926 – 4 February 2008) was an English-American winemaker, the founder of Sterling Vineyards and Newton Vineyard.
Early life.
Peter Leigh Newton was born in London on 27 August 1926, the son of racing driver Frank Newton (who won the Montagu Cup in 1908 at Brooklands). He and his brother Kenneth were educated at Charterhouse School. He earned a law degree from Balliol College, Oxford in 1949. Newton served in the British Army Rifle Corps during World War II.
Career.
Newton became a journalist with the "Financial Times" by chance, after writing a letter to the editor of the newspaper with "his views on the nationalisation of the UK iron and steel industry", and they offered him a job. In 1950, he was posted to San Francisco as their West Coast correspondent. In 1951, he founded his first business, Sterling International, a San Francisco wholesale paper company specialising in tissue paper, at first importing British products into the US and later specialising in the trading of paper and pulp, manufacturing in Canada, Trinidad and Thailand, and later sold it.
Newton founded Sterling Vineyards in 1964 and later, Newton Vineyard. He was responsible for designing and building Sterling Vineyards in 1973, on a hill close to Calistoga, with access to the winery building via an aerial tramway. Prince Charles visited from England in 1977, and was "delighted" by the winery and its wines. In 1979, Newton sold Sterling to Coca-Cola, and started a new more exclusive venture, Newton Vineyard, a pioneer in Napa Valley Merlot, and best known for its "trademark" unfiltered Chardonnay and Merlot.
Personal life.
In 1950, he met an American, Anne St. Aubyn, at a party at his home in Pelham Place, Kensington, London. They married on 28 December 1951 at St Dominic's Church, San Francisco (her hometown), and had three children, Carol Boone of San Francisco; Gail Showley of St. Helena; and Nigel Newton of London. Anne Newton died in 1970. In 1979, he married Su Hua Lin, and they divorced in 2005.
In later life, he was very proud that his granddaughter Alice, then eight, "discovered Harry Potter", after his son Nigel Newton, founder of Bloomsbury Publishing, gave her in 1997 a chapter of a new manuscript by the then unknown J. K. Rowling, already rejected by many other publishers, and she loved it. 
At his home in St. Helena, California, Newton built 15 separate gardens, including Zen, rose, hanging and traditional English, even including a croquet lawn. 
Newton died on 4 February 2008, at his St. Helena home, aged 81, and was buried there at the Grace Episcopal Church Cemetery.

Missing on Lost Island

Missing on Lost Island (aka Ztracený ostrov (Czech), Verschollen Auf Lost Island (German)) is a 2000 Slovak adventure game developed by Mayhem Studios, and published by Bohemia Interactive.
Development.
The game was developed by Riki Computer Games, which later transformed into Mayhem Studios. The Czech voice overs were done by Jiří Lábus, who had previously lent his voice to Slovak adventure game "Ve stínu havrana". The original intention of the title, according to Bonusweb.cz, was to make a serious adventure around the theme of pirates, unlike previous games like the comical "The Secret of Monkey Island". According to Absolute Games, the intention of the debut game from Mayhem Studios was a classic title in the style of "The Secret of Monkey Island" meets "Indiana Jones".
In 2002 when German publisher ARI Data declared bankruptcy, Gamepad acquired the distribution license for German territory.
Plot.
Tim and Diana are on a quest to return to their own time period and location.
Gameplay.
The title is a third-person point-and-click adventure game. Visually, it is reminiscent of the classic adventure games from the first half of the 1990s. The game is in a 256-color palette. The 2D game features handpainted backgrounds.
Critical reception.
Bonusweb.cz thought that while the game had some favourable features, it fell short of promising Czech adventures like "Polda 3" and "Fairy Tale about Father Frost, Ivan and Nastya". Four Fat Chicks favoured the game's low-key characters to the obnoxious style seen in games like "". Quandary thought the game was amusing with some delightful animations. Mr Bill's Adventure Land praised the impressive realistic movement in the game.

Brenda Muntemba

Brenda Muntemba (2 July 1970 – 19 March 2019) was a Zambian diplomat who was serving as the Zambian High Commissioner to Kenya at the time of her death. She had also served as the Commissioner of Police, Southern Province and Chief Program Officer at UNESCO in Zambia. She was a school teacher between 1993 and 1995 at Leopards Hill High School and was also a part-time radio presenter for Radio Phoenix and Christian Voice. Muntemba authored and published four motivational books, under Langmead and Baker; "OFF DUTY" (2011) "In Retrospect" (2013), "Secrets Unveiled" (2015) and The Architect (2018).
Education.
Owing to the fact that her father, Bradley Chesters Muntemba was a police officer, Muntemba and her two sisters, Hazel and Priscilla, attended many primary schools around Zambia, i.e., Northrise in Ndola, Lotus and Northmead and Jacaranda in Lusaka, Hillside in Chipata, and Livingstone Primary in Livingstone. She, however, attended Roma Girls Secondary School, between 1982–1987 and graduated with a bachelor of arts (French major and Economics minor) from the University of Zambia in July 1993. She then proceeded to obtain a specialised masters in translation (French into English) from Marc Bloch University, Strasbourg, France in 2001. Muntemba also undertook leadership training under the United States government ‘Leadership Exchange Programme,’ and the British Council ‘Making a difference Leadership Programme,’ offered to government leaders. She held a certificate in Copyright and Related rights under the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).
Career.
When President Michael Sata, Zambia’s 5th Republican President, was elected into office, he took great steps in putting women in positions of authority. Therefore, Muntemba was appointed Police Commissioner, Southern Province in 2011 alongside five other senior police women commissioners. In 2012, Ms. Muntemba went back to police headquarters as Commissioner Operations. Her stay as Commissioner Operations was short-lived, as she was transferred to Cabinet Office following politically motivated misgivings. During this time, the Cabinet Office assigned her to the Ministry of Education as Zambia’s Chief Programmes Officer for UNESCO (July 2013 – Feb 2015), a position that constantly took her back to her country of language training, France. On 2 February 2015, His Excellency President Edgar Lungu appointed her into foreign service, subsequently retiring her from the Zambia Police Service. Muntemba took her oath of office for the role on the 22nd of April 2015, as President Lungu inducted her as the High Commissioner to Kenya. Her first oath was taken in August 1996 as Assistant Supertintendent, the second in October 2011, as Commissioner of Police, and latterly the third as High Commissioner.
Personal life.
Muntemba was born in Kitwe, to parents Bradley Chesters Muntemba and Hilary Mulenga. Bradley was an officer in the Zambia Police Service, having joined as a direct-entry cadet sub inspector in 1967, and died as assistant commissioner of police, commanding officer, central province of Zambia at the age of 48 years old.
Hilary served the community in various capacities. She served twice the Republic of Zambia as a Constitution Review Commissioner during the Mung’omba and Mwanakatwe Constitution Review Commissions, was one of the founding members of the Women’s Lobby Group in Zambia, as well as the Business and Professional Women’s Association.
Muntemba married Reverend Sulanji Andrew Sichilembe on 27 October 2006, at Lusaka’s Anglican Cathedral of the Holy Cross. She was later ordained as a pastor on 30 December 2012, by Apostle Gift Ntitima at the under Jesus is Life Church, Lusaka. They had a daughter, Lukundo Mirriam Nachilembe.
Death.
Muntemba was involved in a head-on road collision on 26 February 2019 and was admitted to hospital where she died on 19 March 2019. She was 48.

José Bento Pessoa

José Bento Pessoa (7 March 1874, in Figueira da Foz – 7 July 1954, in Lisbon) was a Portuguese cyclist. He was the holder of the 500m world record, that in 1897 won the Spanish National Road Race Championships. José was also a founding partner of the "Ginásio Club Figueirense". The official name of Estádio Municipal José Bento Pessoa was given in his honor.
Career.
From 1892 to 1905, with a break from 1902 to 1905, Passeo raced in Spain; Paris; Ghent, Belgium; Geneva, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Berlin; and Pará, Brazil. In Spain he raced in Vigo, A Coruña, Seville, Bilbao, Salamanca, Ávila, and Madrid. He lived in Madrid for eight months and in Paris for two years. 
In May 1897, at the inauguration of the Chamartín velodrome in Madrid, he won the international competition and beat the world record of the 500 meters, which belonged to Edmond Jacquelin, lowering the time from 34.6 to 33.2 seconds. In Spain, he became an idol, having won all 68 races he entered. On April 10, 1898, at the Velodrome of Geneva, before 20,000 people, he beat the Swiss champion Théodore Champion. He would win other races in Paris, Berlin and perhaps the highest point of his career, the Zimmerman Grand Prix – at the time the most important cycling race in Europe, created in honor of Arthur Augustus Zimmerman – beating the world champion Willy Arend. 
He won a large number of medals and art objects, and among the pecuniary prizes he obtained was what he won in Pará - 10.000 strong escudos (43.75£). When the news of the victories came to his land, the enthusiasm of the figueirenses spread in noisy and festive manifestations: the philharmonic came out, the facade of the Prince Theater illuminated, there were marches, au flambeaux - a madness. And when the champion came to rest - half Figueira was going to party him. He even went from the train station to home into the shoulders of the most enthusiastic. This happened, for example, when, shortly after the defeat of Bento Pessoa, at the feasts of St. John of 1901, he returned from Oporto, where he had twice overthrown José Dionísio at the Velodrome Maria Amélia. (...) On September 1, 1901, the country's cycling clubs paid tribute to the great champion. In order to receive a message and a toast, the cyclist-bureau "Lisboa-Figueira" was organized. José Bento Pessoa was not only a world champion, the greatest speed cyclist of his time, but also a competent coach.

Deposed Crown Princess Kim

Crown Princess Hwi of the Andong Kim clan (1410–1429), also known as Deposed Consort Kim, was the wife of Munjong of Joseon, while he was still the Crown Prince, but was demoted to commoner and thrown out of the palace after she used witchcraft to gain her husband's affection.
Biography.
She was born into the Andong Kim clan, as the youngest child and daughter of Kim Oh-mun, a high-ranking official in charge of military affairs, whilst her grandfather was a magistrate at the Dongnyeongbu (;).
King Sejong selected Lady Kim as consort for his heir apparent, the future King Munjong, in 1427. After journeying from her home, she camped outside Hanseong and the Crown Prince was sent to greet her and escort her to the Eastern Palace.
In 1428, the Crown Princess requested to visit her natal home, to attend the burial rites for her grandfather.
Witchcraft.
Court records indicate that, in the winter of 1428 – 1429, the Crown Princess asked her maid, Ho-cho (호초), how she could gain her husband's love. Ho-cho told her to cut her rivals' shoes into pieces and burn them to ash. She recommended that the consort test the method on two maids that she was already jealous of, Ho-dong (효동) and Deok-kim (덕김), which she promptly did. Crown Princess Hwi then requested further methods and Ho-cho instructed her to drain the fluids from a snake, then rub those essences onto a cloth. Ho-cho claimed that if she wore that cloth in the presence of the Crown Prince, he would love her. Meanwhile, another maid, whom the consort had brought to the palace from her natal home, Sun-deok (순덕), discovered the remains of the burnt shoes in her mistress' perfume pouch. Sun-deok questioned Ho-cho as to how the consort had learnt such things, but hid the shoes.
When the rumours of Crown Princess Hwi's activities reached King Sejong, he ordered that she be confined to her quarters, and her staff, including Sun-deok, were questioned. Ho-cho was sent to the Uigeumbu and Sun-deok told officials where to find the shoe remains. In shock, the King lamented his choice of such a daughter-in-law, ordered that her seal be retracted, her name removed from the ancestral temple and that she be demoted to commoner. The former consort was expelled from the palace so that she would not pollute the royal family.
Aftermath.
After Lady Kim was deposed, her father was also demoted and her brother was removed from his position in the Dongnyeongbu. Ho-cho was beheaded for instructing her mistress in witchcraft.
Several court officials also attempted to have other palace ladies, as well as Lady Kim's parents, interrogated to establish whether they had either been involved in teaching her or covered up her behaviour, but King Sejong denied all these requests.

Nathaniel Grubing

Nathaniel Grubing (fl. 1692-1697) was an English pirate who sailed in service to the French. He is best known for leading several raids on Jamaica before his capture.
History.
Grubing was English and Jamaica-born but sailed for the French after the outbreak of King William's War, as did many other English sailors – Jacobites and Catholics, debtors, and privateers dissatisfied with England's discouragement of privateering. Jamaica's Governor Beeston wrote, “Among the chief of these rogues was one Grubbin, who was born here of English parents, and who knowing every part of the Island had done much mischief by landing in the night, robbing lone settlements, and going away again before notice could be given to any force to oppose him.”
In early 1692 Grubing raided Spanish River in Jamaica. Local authorities commissioned two armed sloops to chase Grubing and other French privateers and offered a reward for his capture. They soon commissioned a third sloop to sail after him and strengthened the island's fortifications. The sloops were unsuccessful and that September they ordered a fourth captain to command the efforts against Grubing, though insubordinate officers hampered his efforts.
On Hispaniola in the summer of 1694 a Jamaican sloop took aboard Grubing's wife, who complained that he “used her very ill.” On his next raid Grubing warned the Jamaicans to return her or “he would carry off every woman he met with till he had his wife again.” He made good on his threat, kidnapping a Major's wife and the 14-year-old daughter of a minister's widow. Beeston sent representatives to French Governor Du Casse to complain but the French ignored their flag of truce and captured Beeston's men as well.
Finally in January 1697 an Englishman named Captain Moses apprehended several Frenchmen, Grubing among them. Beeston rewarded him handsomely. Du Casse demanded Grubing's return and threatened a captured English Captain named Price in return. Beeston was not swayed: “that shall not hinder me from causing Grubbin to suffer whatever the law may condemn him in, nor do I think that Mons. Ducasse will venture to do anything to an innocent man for the punishment of a criminal.”

French ship Fier (1694)

Fier was a first-rate three-decker ship of the line of the French Royal Navy. She was armed on completion with 90 guns, comprising twenty-six 36-pounder guns on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on the middle deck, and twenty-six 8-pounder guns on the upper deck, with ten 6-pounder guns on the quarterdeck. In 1706 an extra pair of 36-pounders was added on the lower deck, and an extra pair of 8-pounders on the upper deck, giving her 94 guns in total,
Designed and constructed by Honoré Malet and Pierre Masson jointly, she was begun at Rochefort in 1693 and launched on 1694, thus becoming the last three-decker to join Louis XIV's Navy. She took part in the Battle of Vélez-Málaga on 13 August 1704. In July 1707 she was sunk in shallow water at Toulon to avoid the fire from bomb vessels, but was refloated in October. She was condemned at Toulon in March 1713, and was sold to be broken up in November 1715.

Municipalities of Brunei

Municipalities in Brunei are settlements which have been incorporated by the government to run as municipalities. They are independent from the hierarchy of the country's subdivisions but nevertheless overlap with mukims and villages, the second- and third-level administrative divisions of Brunei. The governing body of a municipality is municipal department () which is a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs; the head is a chairman (, officially ) which is equivalent to mayor.
List.
There are four settlements in Brunei which have municipal status, namely Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei; Kuala Belait, a town and capital of Belait District; Seria, a town also in Belait District; and Tutong, the town of Tutong District. Although Muara in Brunei-Muara District and Bangar, the capital of Temburong District, are officially known in Malay as and (literally 'Muara Town' and 'Bangar Town'), they do not have municipal status but instead administered as village-level subdivisions.

Highfield House, Heckfield

Highfield House, also known as Highfield Park, is an early 18th-century Queen Anne style country house in Heckfield, Hampshire, England. A Grade II* listed building, it is now a hotel and venue centre.
It is built in brick with Bath stone dressings with a hipped tile roof and three facades. The north front is in three storeys, the remainder in two. There is a large 19th-century porch with Doric columns.
In 1757 the house, then known as Heckfield House, and its surrounding estate was incorporated into the neighbouring estate of Stratfield Saye, then owned by the Pitt family. Highfield (or Heckfield) House was occupied around that time by General Sir William Augustus Pitt, who improved the building and its associated parkland. Ten years after his death in 1809 the house was renamed Highfield to avoid confusion with another Heckfield House nearby.
For some years the house was residence of the Hon. General Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, an army officer during the Peninsular war, and a personal friend of the Duke of Wellington. War Cabinet member and former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain died of cancer in November 1940 whilst living in the house.
In the 1980s Highfield Park (as it was then called) was an Educational Services Center for the Digital Equipment Corporation, combining IT training with the country house experience.
The building is now a 3-star hotel, known as Highfield Park, standing in of parkland, which offers accommodation as well as event and conference facilities.

In 1742, Morden inherited the Norfolk properties of his mother's brother Harbord Harbord, and assumed the surname Harbord in place of that of Morden by royal licence to meet the will's conditions. In the 1740s he began the construction of Gunton Hall designed by the architect Matthew Brettingham. He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath on 28 May 1744 and a baronet on 22 March 1746. He was returned unopposed again at the 1747 British general election. He voted consistently for the Government. He retired at the 1754 British general election.
Death and legacy.
Harbord died on 17 February 1770, leaving two sons. His eldest son Harbord (1734–1810) succeeded to the baronetcy.

Mike Roman

Michael Roman is an American political operative and opposition researcher. Roman was a staffer for President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018. He subsequently worked for the Trump 2020 campaign. Prior to working for Trump, Roman ran an in-house intelligence unit for the Koch brothers.
Roman has a history of making misleading and unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud. On Election Day in 2020, he posted baseless and deceptive claims of voter fraud.
Career.
He began his career as a Republican Party activist in Philadelphia, his hometown.
Early in his career Roman was a political consultant in his home state of Pennsylvania and in New Jersey. He was director of Election Day operations at the Republican National Committee. He has been employed by the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain. Roman also served as chief of staff to former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling.
Roman was a senior advisor on the 2016 Trump campaign as the campaign's chief poll watcher.
Prior to joining the Trump presidential campaign, Roman headed up an intelligence gathering operation for Charles and David Koch, industrialists and high-profile Republican donors. The now-defunct office surveilled and gathered intelligence on liberal opponents of conservative policies.
Roman describes his blog "Election Journal" as dedicated to "fraud, cheating, dirty tricks, absurdity and other election news." According to Richard L. Hasen, Chancellor's Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Irvine, the blog appears to focus, "only on incidents favoring Republican's claims against Democrats. During the 2008 presidential election, "Election Monitoring", combined GoogleMaps, with Twitter, Flickr and YouTube to enable voters and poll watchers to post what they saw as instances of voter disenfranchisement and election fraud in a real time, online map. One scholar, while recognizing the non-verifiable nature of this approach, asserted that it "opens up new potential for election monitoring that addresses some of the limitations that established and official (election monitoring organizations) face.
White House role.
Roman's role in the Trump White House as Director of Special Projects and Research, which "Politico" calls a "a vague title that reveals almost nothing," has drawn attention because in previous administrations it was usual for opposition researchers to work for the campaign or on the staff of the presidential transition team, rather than directly for the White House. He left the White House in April 2018.

Surendre Rambocus

Surendre Sradhanand "Soerinder" Rambocus (5 May 1953 – 8 December 1982) was a Surinamese serviceman. For a short period, he was the highest ranking officer of the Suriname National Army. He was involved in the unsuccessful coup d'état of March 1982 against the then dictator of Suriname, Dési Bouterse, and was executed on 8 December 1982 as one of the December murders.
Biography.
Rambocus was born on 5 May 1953 in the Nickerie District. He attended the Royal Military Academy in Breda, Netherlands and graduated in 1978 on a thesis about coup d'états. He then became a second lieutenant in the Suriname National Army.
Background.
The Netherlands granted Suriname independence on 25 November 1975. The hastily-created army had many non-commissioned officers, but very few officers. The army was commanded by Yngwe Elstak who demanded discipline and was adamant that there was no promotion without graduating from the military academy. The NCOs tried to form a union, demanded better pay and opportunities of promotion. Prime Minister Henck Arron refused to recognise them and arrested the ringleaders, who were to go to trial on 26 February 1980.
1980 coup d'état.
On 25 February 1980, 16 non-commissioned officers of the army deposed the government, and set up a military dictatorship, led by sergeant Desi Bouterse. Rambocus was not a member of the coup plotters, however he was sympathetic to their cause, and the subject had been discussed privately. In an interview with Jozef Slagveer after the coup, Bouterse revealed that he did not trust Rambocus. Nevertheless, Rambocus and Jeff Wirht were the only officers who accepted the new regime. Rambocus was appointed by the military authority as highest ranking officer of the Suriname National Army, and was ordered to maintain discipline in the army. 
Rambocus became more and more critical of the regime. Rambocus was of the opinion that soldiers do not belong in the centre of power. He was dismissed by the National Military Council, and later arrested three times. In December 1980, he was released by , the Minister of Justice, because he had been jailed without charge. He then left for the Netherlands, and became a law student at the University of Utrecht. According his brother, he returned to Suriname in May 1981 without providing any specifics.
Rambocus coup d'état.
On the night of 10 to 11 March 1982, Rambocus freed Sergeant Major Wilfred Hawker from jail. Together they committed a counter-coup, and took control of the . They called themselves the National Liberation Council. The plan was to attack Fort Zeelandia, the headquarters of Bouterse, with a tank, however Lachman, a member of the council, defected to Bouterse with the tank, and the conspirators were arrested.
Hawker was executed by firing squad which was broadcast on television. Baal Oemrawsingh, professor and former member of parliament, was considered the brains behind the coup. His dead body was discovered on 15 March 1982, and labelled a suicide. Paul Somohardjo was arrested, but received permission to visit the funeral of his grandmother. He used the opportunity to escape to the Netherlands.
Rambocus and his subordinate Jiwansingh Sheombar were imprisoned in Fort Zeelandia. A trial followed, in which the lawyers John Baboeram, Eddy Hoost, and Harold Riedewald argued that the counter-coup from Rambocus could not be unlawful, because the Bouterse regime itself had come to power in a non-legitimate way. The court nevertheless sentenced Rambocus to twelve years in prison.
December murders.
On the night of 7 to 8 December 1982, various people were captured by the soldiers of Bouterse and taken to Fort Zeelandia, among them the lawyers Baboeram, Gonçalves, Hoost, and Riedewald. Rambocus was also taken from his cell in the Memre Boekoe barracks and transferred to Fort Zeelandia. There, Rambocus called Bouterse to account for his actions, in the presence of almost all the original perpetrators of the Sergeants' coup, and challenged Bouterse to a duel with Uzis, so they could fight it out without innocent casualties. However, he was sentenced to death, and on 8 December, Rambocus and 14 others at Fort Zeelandia were tortured and later killed.
On 23 March 2012, Ruben Rozendaal, also suspect in the trial of the December murders, declared under oath to the court martial that Bouterse had personally killed Rambocus and Cyrill Daal at the time. , the former minister of agriculture confirmed the story in his book "De Decembermoorden in Suriname" (1983). According to the report of the International Commission of Jurists, his face was swollen and he was riddled with bullets.
Surendre Rambocus was the brother of, among others, the Dutch politician .

Bellia gens

The gens Bellia, also written Billia and Bilia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned in history, but several are known from inscriptions. 
Origin.
As the Bellii are not mentioned by ancient writers, there are no traditions relating to the origin of this gens, and the nomen is not listed among the gentilicia for which Chase was able to ascribe a particular origin; it resembles other gentiles formed using the suffixes , "-ellius", and "-illius", frequently derived from cognomina ending in "-ulus", but sometimes from words ending in "-illus" or "-ellus". The root was probably "bellus", handsome or beautiful, but the use of surnames such as "Clemens" and "Pacatus" by some members of this gens suggests that the name was associated with "bellum", war. The nomen Duilius or Duellius was derived from an older form of "bellum", and so might be a cognate of "Bellius". The nomen "Bellienus" seems to be derived from this gentilicium, which may give a clue to the geographical origin of the family, since the suffix "-enus" was common in names from Picenum and Umbria, and some of the inscriptions of the Bellii are from Pisaurum in Umbria.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Bellii were "Gaius", "Marcus", "Titus", and "Numerius". The first three were very common throughout Roman history, while "Numerius" was somewhat more distinctive, and typical of the Roman countryside. The only other regular praenomen found among the Bellii was "Lucius", perhaps the most abundant of all Roman names. "Primus", given in the filiation of a Roman matron from Gallia Narbonensis, was an archaic praenomen, but in its masculine form it was little used in historical times, except as a surname, or in Cisalpine Gaul, where unusual praenomina were fashionable. It could have been the praenomen of the woman's father, but was more probably his surname. "Suavis", given in another filiation, is not known as a praenomen, and may also have been the father's surname, but because one of the persons named in the same inscription was either a slave or freedwoman, it may be that the Suavis referred to had been a slave, or at least was not a Roman citizen, and so did not possess a regular praenomen.
Branches and cognomina.
There is no evidence that the Bellii were ever divided into distinct families. They used a variety of personal surnames, some of which belonged to freedmen, and were their original personal names. Other surnames included "Belliolus", a diminutive of "Bellius", evidently given to a little boy; "Clemens", gentle, mild; "Marcellinus", a diminutive of "Marcellus", probably indicating that an earlier ancestor was named "Marcellus"; "Pacatus", peaceful, calm; "Plautus", given to someone with broad or flat feet; and "Reginus", indicating someone who came from Rhegium.

After HScott closed at the end of 2016, a new team to the KNPSE signed Dippel for 2017 in Rette Jones Racing. Dippel raced three races with ARCA Racing Series team Win-Tron Racing in 2017, at Toledo Speedway and the series' two dirt track races. He failed to finish two but turned in a third-place showing at Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack. In 2018, Dippel signed with Chad Bryant Racing and finished sixth with the team in his first race at Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway.
In early February 2018, Dippel and RJR confirmed a second season together in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East. Dippel left the team after one race, citing a lack of performance, and joined MDM Motorsports for the second race on the schedule. After that, Dippel joined DGR-Crosley for the remainder of the 2018 season. He won his first race with the team, at Langley Speedway, after winning the pole. He and teammate Tyler Ankrum used tire strategy to their advantage, conserving them at the start to have the most speed at the end. Before the season finale, it was announced that after deliberation within the team following the previous race, Dippel and the team would move in different directions. The move came after Ankrum had voiced displeasure with Dippel's driving after the end of the New Hampshire race. Dippel had also intentionally crashed Ankrum at the conclusion of the race at New Jersey Motorsports Park. Team owner David Gilliland stated: "After much internal discussion following the race at New Hampshire, we agreed parting ways was the right decision for all parties involved. Tyler has been an integral part of our program this year and we thank him for his contribution to our growth and success. We wish him and his family nothing but the best going forward."
Gander Outdoors Truck Series.
Parlaying off of his K&amp;N efforts, Dippel made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut at Eldora Speedway in 2018 with DGR-Crosley, driving the organization's No. 17 entry. On September 26, 2018, it was announced that he would join GMS Racing's No. 25 entry for the four remaining races of 2018. His best result on the year came at the Eldora race, finishing thirteenth.
For 2019, Dippel was announced to take over the No. 02 truck at Young's Motorsports, replacing Austin Hill. His first career top-ten finish came at Texas Motor Speedway in April. Dippel drew the ire of competitor Ben Rhodes at the Eldora Dirt Derby; Dippel failed an attempted slide job on Rhodes late in the race, pushing Rhodes into the fence and dropping him six spots behind Dippel. After the race, Dippel rammed into Rhodes on the cooldown lap, leading Rhodes to attempt to drag Dippel out of his truck on pit road after the race before being pulled away by NASCAR officials. Dippel later called out Rhodes in an expletive-laced tirade, calling it "cool" that Rhodes would miss the playoffs and implying that Rhodes was scared of fighting him. Rhodes, in a calmer postrace interview, called Dippel a dirty driver.
On August 23, 2019, days before the Chevrolet Silverado 250 at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Dippel was indefinitely suspended by NASCAR for violating its conduct policy. At the time of his suspension, he was 13th in points with three top-ten finishes. On the Monday after the suspension was announced, it was confirmed by NASCAR that the suspension stemmed from a traffic stop and subsequent arrest in New York when state troopers found drugs linked to Adderall in Dippel's vehicle. The charges were dropped the following week and he was reinstated.
Personal life.
In March 2019, Dippel was arrested on account of reckless driving during the Martinsville Speedway race weekend, later pleading guilty to improper driving. In summer 2019, Dippel was ejected from a casino near Pocono Raceway for having a fake identification card. In August 2019, Dippel was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in New York after state troopers found amphetamines in his car. The charges were eventually dropped after the amphetamines in the car were found to have belonged to a friend who claimed responsibility to leaving it in the car.

Minnie Baldock

Lucy Minnie Baldock (née Rogers; 20 November 1864 – 10 December 1954) was a British suffragette. Along with Annie Kenney, she co-founded the first branch in London of the Women's Social and Political Union. 
Life and activism.
Lucy Minnie Rogers was born in Bromley-by-Bow in 1864. She worked in sweated labour shirt factory and married Harry Baldock in 1888, and they had two children. The East End of London was known for its poor conditions and the Baldocks joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) after the socialist Keir Hardie became their local Member of Parliament (M.P.) in 1892. She worked with Charlotte Despard and Dora Montefiore. She took charge of the local unemployment Fund that was used to mitigate extreme hardship. Women were not then allowed to be Members of Parliament, but the ILP chose her as their candidate to sit on the West Ham Board of Guardians in 1905.
Baldock and Annie Kenney formed the first London branch (in Canning Town) of the then Manchester based Women's Social and Political Union in 1906, holding meetings at Canning Town Public Hall. Baldock attended 21 December 1905 pre-election meeting of the Liberals at the Royal Albert Hall dressed as a 'maid' to Annie Kenney (who wore a fur coat) and both sat in a box and Kenney hung a banner over the edge saying 'Votes for Women' and called out, resulting in a disturbance. The next day Baldock visited Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman with Kenney and Teresa Billington to ask about when Liberals would deal with female suffrage, resulting in Dora Montefiore congratulating Baldock's 'noble stand' in a postcard. Baldock became a paid employee of the WSPU and a mentor to Daisy Parsons, and had a postal order for 30shillings from Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to cover the costs of attending meetings in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. Speakers invited to address the Canning Town group included Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Annie Kenney and Flora Drummond. Baldock also organised and spoke at an open air meeting in Upton Park. Baldock was arrested on 23 October 1906 (along with Nellie Martel and Anne Cobden Sanderson) for disorderly conduct during the opening of Parliament. In 1907 she reported to the group on her visit to Jane Sbarborough in Holloway Prison when she heard about signalling between suffragettes, imprisoned at the same time, but not allowed to talk to each other. Baldock was also at the prison gate with Christabel Pankhurst to support Flora Drummond and others released to have a celebratory hotel breakfast. She also spoke in June 1907 at a Knightsbridge home event at the request of Louise Eates, Kensington WSPU and in August at a home in Kensington with Emmeline Pankhurst as noted by Sara Jessie Stephenson in her pamphlet "No Other Way,"
In November 1907, Baldock was recording being ejected from a Liberal MP's event on the Isle of Dogs but stood on a chair outside a window calling out "Votes for Women". In summer 1908 she was in Nottingham with Elsa Gye to build up its WSPU. In April 1909 she was with around 500 suffragettes at breakfast in Picadiily for Mrs Pethick-Lawrence's release from custody. 
Arrest.
Baldock was with twelve women who were arrested after walking single file through the streets towards the House of Commons with Mrs. Pankhurst in February 1908 "to present a petition from the Conference at Caxton Hall, and to the refusal of the authorities to treat suffragist offenders as first-class misdemeanants." Baldock was arrested along with Mrs Pankhurst and others and was charged with resisting and obstructing the police.
Baldock had to leave her two boys with their father whilst she served a month in jail and her fellow suffragettes assisted, including Maud Arncliff Sennett sending toys. Baldock got out a message published in "Votes for Women 1 March 1908 p 82," that "I love freedom so dearly that I want all women to have it, and I will fight for it until they get it" In April that year, Emily Cobb, WSPU offered to sponsor the cost of a house help so that Baldock could be 'set free to do work you "can" do [ for the Cause] and many of us can not', and in May Baldock was with Annie Kenney in Bristol , renting a house near the venue Augustine Birrell Liberal MP and Irish secretary of state, was to be speaking at, to help Elsie Howey and Vera Holme who hid overnight in the Hall to get into the event. In October 1909, Baldock was arrested again with Flora Drummond and the Pankhursts back at Clement's Inn.
As a suffragette who had been to jail she was given the honour of planting a commemorative tree at Eagle House in Somerset in February 1909. The house was the home of Mary Blathwayt's parents who supported the cause. Her father took commemorative photographs and afterwards he sent her flower plants in the following April for her garden.
The following year Baldock spoke on Wimbledon Common, and had her travel paid by Minnie Turner, to support Mary Clarke campaigning in Brighton for a week in the summer.
In 1911, Baldock was diagnosed with cancer and she underwent surgery performed by Louisa Aldrich-Blake. Baldock recovered but broke contact with the increasingly militant WSPU. She did keep in contact with Edith How-Martyn and she was still a member of the Church League for Women's Suffrage. At the start of 1913 she and her family had to move to Liverpool for her sons to seek work in shipyards, although she and husband were also reported to be in Southampton in 1914.
Baldock took part in Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral, carrying the purple white and green colours (1928) and attended her statue unveiling in 1930. Baldock also supported How-Martyn in documenting the movement in the Suffragette Fellowship.
She lived to be ninety and died in Poole in 1954.
Posthumous recognition.
Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018. In 2011, Poole Museum and the National Lottery funds sponsored a short film on Baldock's life called "The Right to Vote" by Kate O'Malley starring Michelle O'Brien.

Harbord Harbord

Harbord Harbord (possibly 1675 – 28 January 1742) was an East Anglian landowner and Member of Parliament. He was known as Harbord Cropley from his birth until 1742.
Life.
He was the eldest son of Colonel William Cropley of Shelland in Suffolk. and his wife Catherine Harbord, daughter of Sir Charles Harbord, surveyor general to Charles I of Great Britain. William was Catherine's second husband, after the death of her first (Thomas Wright of Kilverstone, Norfolk). Sir Charles had bought Stanninghall from the Waldegraves in 1648 and left it to his only son John Harbord, who also acquired Gunton.
Harbord Cropley was educated in Drinkstone and Bury-St-Edmunds before attending Caius College, Cambridge from 9 May 1694. His mother's brother John Harbord died without heirs in 1710 and left most of his estates to Harbord Cropley, who changed his name to Harbord Harbord. This enabled a minor political career - he was elected for Norfolk in a by-election in 1728, voted for the Excise Bill in 1733, but did not stand for re-election in 1734.
His first wife was Jane Rant, daughter of Sir William Rant of Thorpe Market, Norfolk. She died by 17 May 1737, when he remarried to the widow Rebecca Wrench, daughter of Sir Benjamin Wrench, a doctor from Norwich - Rebecca's first husband had been John Marcon of Norwich. Harbord did not have issue by either wife and so passed his Norfolk properties to William Morden, son of his sister Judith.

Indiana University School of Nursing

The Indiana University School of Nursing is an academic college of higher education connected to Indiana University with its main research and educational facilities on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus and at Indiana University Bloomington. The School offers nursing programs and clinical training at all of IU's regional campuses and IU Health hospitals in Indiana, as well as online. It is known for its nursing research and education, scholarship of teaching and nursing practice, and for its collaborations with IU hospitals and clinical partners. Established in 1914 as the Indiana University Training School for Nurses, it awarded its first nursing diplomas in 1917 and was renamed the IU School of Nursing in 1956. It offers a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, and two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The IU nursing school has received multiple research grants from the National Institutes of Health.
As of 2017 "U.S. News &amp; World Report" ranked the IU School of Nursing at twenty-eighth in the country for its master's degree program and twenty-third for its DNP degree; College Choice ranked IUPUI's undergraduate nursing program twenty-third among U.S. colleges and universities. In addition, the National League for Nursing has designated the IU School of Nursing as a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education has accredited the IU School of Nursing programs in Indianapolis and Bloomington. Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne, IU East, IU Kokomo, IU Northwest, IU South Bend, IU Southeast, and IUPUI are members of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
History.
The Indiana University Training School for Nurses was founded in 1914 as part of the IU School of Medicine in Indianapolis; it was renamed the IU School of Nursing in 1956. The nursing school became known for its excellence in nursing research and education, scholarship of teaching and nursing practice, recruitment of well-educated faculty and school administrators, and for its collaborations with IU hospitals and clinical partners.
Founding in Indianapolis.
The Indiana University Training School for Nurses was established at Indianapolis in 1914; its first student arrived on June 19, 1914. At the time of its founding, the IU program was one of about 1,800 nursing schools in operation in the United States. It was also one of the four early nursing schools in Indiana that was affiliated with a university. The IU nursing school was planned in connection with the construction of the Robert W. Long Hospital, the IU School of Medicine's first teaching hospital. Long Hospital, which opened in 1914, was built on a tract of land near City Hospital, about northwest of the downtown Indianapolis (the present-day site of Indiana University – Purdue University at Indianapolis).
While Long Hospital was under construction, Doctor Charles P. Emerson, dean of the IU School of Medicine, chose Alice Fitzgerald as the first Director of the IU Training School for Nurses and the Superintendent of Nurses. (From its founding in 1914 to 1956, when it became IU's tenth academic school and was renamed the IU School of Nursing, the school's director was responsible for IU hospital's nursing staff and the education of IU nursing students.) Fitzgerald arrived in Indianapolis in the fall of 1913 to help equip the new hospital and organize the nurses training school. Fitzgerald also worked with the faculty at IU Bloomington to establish the criteria for students to earn bachelor's and nursing degrees from IU. She also established the nursing school's initial curriculum and designed its first uniforms.
Bertha Ellen Rizer of Worthington, Indiana, was the first nursing student to arrive for training on June 19, 1014. Eight other women joined Rizer to form the first class of nursing students. In 1915, its second year of operation, the nursing program had a total of seventeen enrolled students. Five students completed their three years of training in 1917 and become IU's first graduating class of nurses. They received the nursing diplomas on June 13, 1917, at commencement ceremonies on the IU campus in Bloomington, Indiana. By 1931 IU had 168 student nurses in training at Indianapolis, but enrollment declined during the Great Depression. By 1941, when the IU Training School for Nurses was first accredited by the National League for Nursing Education, it had graduated 1,300 nurses.
Early facilities.
Until the completion of the IU School of Medicine's academic building (Emerson Hall) on the present-day IUPUI campus, nursing students attended classes at Long Hospital and at the IU medical school's facility at Market Street and Senate Avenue, which was several blocks east of the hospital. After the new building opened in 1919, nursing students used its laboratories, as well as classroom space in Long Hospital. With the opening of the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children in 1924 and the William H. Coleman Hospital for Women in 1927, both of which are located on the IUPUI campus, clinical training opportunities were significantly increased for nurses in the areas of pediatrics, maternity, and gynecology. Completion of the Kiwanis Wing (1930) and the Rotary Convalescent Home (1931) at Riley Hospital further expanded IU's hospital services and clinical training facilities in Indianapolis.
During its first years of operation in Indianapolis, IU had no residence halls for nurses on campus. IU hospital nurses and student nurses were housed on a private floor of Long Hospital and in nearby homes, referred to as cottages, that the university had purchased or leased. Between 1923 and 1925, small stucco cottages for nursing student housing were built near Long Hospital and after Riley Hospital was completed in 1924, a few student nurses were housed the hospital's intern and nursing wing. Increased the demand for nurses and additional enrollment of nursing students made it necessary to construct additional housing.
Ball Residence for Nurses, which was dedicated on October 7, 1928, was the first permanent resident for nursing students on the IU campus in Indianapolis. Funding for its construction came from a $500,000 gift from IU trustee George A. Ball of the Ball Brothers of Muncie, Indiana. The residence hall was named in honor of the Ball family. George Ball donated an additional $10,000 to improve the landscape around Ball Residence in 1929 and create the Nurses' Sunken Garden and Convalescent Park, which included formal gardens and Robert William Davidson's bronze statue, "Eve," at the center of a fountain. The fountain and statue were installed when garden was completed in 1934. Students nicknamed the statue "Flo" in tribute to Florence Nightingale.
In 1966, a year after construction began on IU Hospital (the present-day IU Health University Hospital), the IU School of Nursing began planning a building of its own. The new academic building on the IUPUI campus was dedicated in May 1974.
Early programs.
At a time when most nursing schools did not require students to have a high school diploma in order to enroll, IU's early nursing students had to be a high school graduate, rank in the upper third of their high school graduating class, and meet the admission requirements of the IU School of Liberal Arts. Prospective nursing students also had to have earned credits for college-level coursework from IU or other college or university before enrolling in its three-year nursing program. (Previously-earned credits could shorten the hours required for the student to earn a graduate nursing diploma.) In addition, the nursing curriculum allowed students to earn a bachelor's degree after completing the required hours of courses in IU's College of Liberal Arts and the nurses training program in Indianapolis.
Faculty of the IU School of Medicine and the IU College of Liberal Arts initially provided training for nursing students in Indianapolis that included classroom lectures and demonstrations, as well as clinical training at Long Hospital. Training in psychiatric nursing was conducted nearby at Central State Hospital. Student nurses were also on duty in Long Hospital for eight hours each day, Monday through Friday, and for six hours on Sunday, until the requirement was phased out in the 1960s. After World War II, when the demand for trained nurses continued to remain high, the IU School of Education at IU Bloomington expanded its curriculum by offering its first program leading to a master's degree in nursing education.
In 1956, when the IU Training School for Nurses was renamed the IU School of Nursing, separate directors were established for the IU nursing school and hospital nursing staff. Emily Holmquist became the first dean of the IU School of Nursing in 1957, which began a new era for the School. By the late 1950s, the IU School of Nursing had become known as "a Midwestern center for nursing scholarship, teaching, research, and service," but it transitioned into a school with a national reputation for its advanced nursing programs and research.
In the late 1950s the IU nursing school began its first global training programs and made changes to its curriculum and degree programs. The School's first international exchange program was introduced in 1959, when the faculty helped develop nursing schools in Korea. Subsequent projects provided nursing students with cross-cultural studies and global service opportunities in Australia, Costa Rica, and India, as well as Moi University in Kenya, the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Liberia, and at Peking University and Sun Yat-sen University in China. During the same period, the IU nursing school also discontinued its three-year general nursing degree (the last of this type of diploma was issued in 1960) and replaced it with a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree that the National League for Nursing accredited in 1961. The School's curriculum also expanded to include offerings in public health nursing. Continuing education programs and a two-year associate degree were launched in the mid-1960s. Adult and pediatric nurse practitioner programs began in 1971. IU established the established the state's first clinical nurse specialist program and first doctor of nursing science degree (DNS) in Indiana in the mid-1970s.
The opening of the nursing school's new academic facilities in Indianapolis in the mid-1970s provided opportunities to introduce new instructional methods. The School became a pioneer in the early creation and use of closed-circuit television and video instruction. It was also an innovator in the use of digital technology and distance learning, including the development of online nursing courses and degree programs, as well as instructional videos. In addition, the School's faculty became leaders in the National Black Nurses Association, founders of the Midwest Nursing Research Society and the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists, and organizers of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners. In 1922, six IU nursing students founded Sigma Theta Tau International, a global nursing society.
Curriculum and enrollment.
The present-day IU School of Nursing's curriculum provides professional training and a broad, foundational education that encourages high standards of scholarship and expert care of patients. As of 2017 its degree programs include a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree, a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree, and two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Doctor of Philosophy in nursing (Ph.D.). The IU School of Nursing's two–year Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) degree was phased out and moved to Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana. IU's final ASN degrees were conferred in 2004.
In 2017, the "U.S. News and World Report" ranked the IU School of Nursing twenty-eighth for its master's degree program and twenty-third for its DNP degree among U.S. colleges and universities and ranked the IUPUI School of Nursing's online graduate program thirty-ninth. College Choice ranked the IUPUI's undergraduate nursing program twenty-third among U.S. colleges and universities.
A total of 329 graduate students were enrolled in graduate nursing programs at IUPUI for the 2017–18 academic year; an additional 108 students were enrolled in its online graduate nursing programs.
Accreditation.
In May 1941 the IU Training School for Nurses was on the first list of the National League of Nursing Education's accredited schools of nursing. In 1992 the League accredited the IU School of Nursing’s degree programs on all eight of the IU campuses. More recently, the National League for Nursing has designated the IU School of Nursing in Indianapolis as a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education in two categories: Advance of Science of Nursing Education (2012–21) and Promote the Pedagogical Expertise of Faculty (2006–22).
The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education has accredited the IU School of Nursing’s BSN, MSN, and DNP programs. Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne, IU East, IU Kokomo, IU Northwest, IU South Bend, IU Southeast, and IUPUI are members of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
Facilities.
The IU School of Nursing's main building is on the Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis campus, with nursing programs and clinical training are offered at IU's regional campuses in Indiana and at IU Health hospitals. In 1966 the School began planning its new facility at IUPUI. Construction began on the $7 million, nearly building in 1970. It is located between Long Hospital and IU's Clinical Building, south of Riley Hospital, and is a part of the IU Health Medical Center complex. The School of Nursing building was dedicated in May 1974. A $600,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health and a $300,000 appropriation from the state legislature provided additional funding to construct a television studio in the building.
In 2006 the IU nursing school established the Center for Research in Nursing Education in Indianapolis. In 2008 it opened the Jean Johnson Schaefer Resource Center for Innovation in Clinical Nursing Education, a training facility at IUPUI.
Research.
The School's research projects over several decades have established its "national reputation as a center of excellence for scholars of nursing education." In 1976 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Nursing Faculty Fellowship Program in Primary Care chose the IU School of Nursing as one of four training sites in the U.S. "to provide extended primary health care nursing skills training, curriculum development, physician collaboration, and clinical research." Since that time the nursing school has developed and implemented primary care programs around Indiana, including maternity and prenatal care programs, community health care projects, rural family health care, geriatric care, and health care programs for immigrants. For more than twenty years the School has received funding for research from the National Institute for Nursing Research at the National Institutes of Health. NIH-funded projects began in 1999 with the nursing school's Center for Enhancing Quality of Life in Chronic Illness (CEQL), one of nine core research centers in the country at that time. Its other NIH-funded project include the Behavioral Cooperative Oncology Group of the Mary Margaret Walther Program for Cancer Research and the Center for Research in Nursing Education.
A School-hosted research conference in 1977 resulted in the establishment of the Midwest Nursing Research Society. More recently, the School's research initiatives have included Research in Palliative and End-of-Life Communication and Training (RESPECT) that was established in 2013.

Bob the Builder (2015 TV series)

Bob the Builder is a British CGI animated children's television series and a reboot of the animated television show of the same name. It was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 5, beginning on 1 September 2015 and PBS Kids in the United States in 14 November. 
Despite being set in an alternate continuity from the original series, most online sources list the reboot as the 19th season and onward.
Production and broadcast.
After the original show ended in 2011, Mattel bought the "Bob the Builder" franchise for a revamped original series. The series was given a visual overhaul for both the environmental hybrid characters and the scenery, with Bob and his team moving to the bustling metropolis of Fixham. The CGI animation remained and the construction projects and buildings are significantly larger and more advanced. Mr. Bentley is now seen with a new character, Mayor Madison and a new builder named Leo joined the building team. Several new vehicles have CGI faces were also introduced, including a heavy delivery vehicle named Two-Tonne.
Turner Broadcasting System later bought the broadcasting rights for the 2015 series for the United Kingdom to be repeated on Cartoon Network UK's sister preschool channel Cartoonito UK. The channel began airing the series in January 2016. After the second season ended Rainmaker Entertainment announced that they have ceased animating the show due to issues the company was having at the time. DHX Media announced that they had started work for the third season and that their Halifax studio have officially replaced Rainmaker Entertainment.
The show also aired on Family Jr. in Canada, as well as 10 Peach "(formerly known as Eleven)" and ABC Kids in Australia in 2016. In the United States, it aired on PBS Kids from 2015 until 2018. Qubo aired the reboot series on 26 August 2019 for only the third series, but the original British dub is aired on that channel, instead of the American dub. The show currently airs on Kids Street.
Reception and criticism.
The reboot was poorly received by longtime fans of the older series. Criticism focused on the characters' redesigns and the changes to their personalities.

The Gardens Casino is a cardroom casino located in Hawaiian Gardens, California. The casino was founded in 1997 and only offers card games. The casino started with a space of 59,900 square feet. In 2016, the casino underwent a $90 million renovation and expanded to 200,000 square feet.
In 2017, the casino faced a possible loss of license after admitting it failed to follow federal anti-money laundering laws. Keith Sharp, the Gardens Casino’s general counsel, stated managers have taken responsibility for the failure and "have made tremendous steps in improving our programs".
On December 5, 2019 California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced a $3.1 million settlement with Hawaiian Gardens Casino for “misleading gambling regulators and violating the Bank Secrecy Act.” The settlement was in addition to the $2.8 million penalty imposed on the casino by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The casino was also required to complete a 24-month compliance period to meet the terms of the settlement. 
The television webcast show, "Poker Night in America", has hosted shows at the casino with an upcoming live show set to be broadcast in March 2018.

Annot Robinson

Annot Robinson, nicknamed Annie, (née Wilkie) (8 June 1874 – 29 September 1925) was a Scottish suffragette and pacifist. She was sentenced to six months for trying to break in to the House of Commons. She helped to found the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.
Early life.
Born Annot Erskine Wilkie on 8 June 1874 in Montrose, Scotland, to John Wilkie (a draper) and Catherine Jane Erskine (a teacher). Wilkie was one of three daughters. Her sister, Helen Wilkie, later became Secretary of the Dundee branch of the Women’s Freedom League. Helen was a "gifted orator" who organised women for a Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) march in Edinburgh in 1907 and was part of the deputation who met with Winston Churchill in 1909.
Wilkie was a pupil teacher at Montrose Academy until she was 16. She then went on to teacher training college, before taking external classes in English, French, Astronomy, Comparative Religion and History at the University of St Andrews, where she was awarded the LLA in 1901.
Campaigning for women's suffrage.
Wilkie worked as a teacher in Dundee and it was while she was working here that she was influenced by Agnes Husband (a member of the Dundee Labour Party.)
In 1906 she became the first secretary of the Dundee branch of the Women’s Social and Political Union. In 1907 she moved to Manchester and became an organizer for the Women’s Social and Political Union, as well as joining the local branch of the Independent Labour Party, which she had become a member of the year before. In 1908 she and other members of the Women’s Social and Political Union tried to break into the House of Commons after arriving hidden in a furniture van, for which she was sentenced to six months in prison. In 1910 she became an organizer for the Women's Labour League and offered a conference resolution condemning the leadership of the Labour Party for failing to support the Women’s Labour League and women's suffrage. She later became an organizer for the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, but during the war she resigned from that, helped found the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, organized Women's Peace Crusades throughout the nation, and worked for equal pay for female munitions factory workers. After the war she worked as a Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom organizer until 1922, and as such traveled to America, Britain, and Holland.
Death.
She died in Perth Royal Infirmary during an operation, and Ellen Wilkinson wrote her obituary. Wilkinson described her as "a big woman and a big personality" with "an exquisite sense of the ridiculous and a sharp tongue."
Posthumous recognition.
Her name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

Teeboy

Teeboy () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is "Tubwee".
Geography.
Teeboy is bounded on the north by Arderry townland, on the west by Corratillan, Culliagh and Muineal townlands and on the east by Drumlougher, Gortnacargy and Tirnawannagh townlands. Its chief geographical features are Bunerky Lough (Irish = Loch Bun Adhairc = The Lake of the Butt of the Horn), the River Blackwater, County Cavan, forestry plantations, small streams, a gravel pit, spring wells and dug wells. Teeboy is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 472 statute acres. The sub-divisions in the townland are Whitepark; Blackpark; Rock Field; Kilepark; The Gurteens (Guirtíní = The Small Gardens); Cruckane (Cnocán = The Little Hill); Poolaphouca (Poll an Phúca = The Púca's Hollow in the Fort); Torreewa (Tor Riabhach = The Speckled Hill); Curraghstill (Currach a sTéill = The Bog of the Division); Mallai Buidhe - a field owned by Mr Peter McGovern in 1938, covered with yellow ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Teeboy was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Gortnekargie" (Irish "Gort na Carraige", meaning 'The Field of the Rock'). 
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as "Teeboy".
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as "Toeboy".
Another name for the townland was Aghadrumderg (Irish- Achadh Droma Deirg = The Field of the Red Ridge).
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 4 June 1611, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, "two polls of Tewbay to Breene Og Magauran, gentleman". He was the son of Brian Óg Mág Samhradháin who was chief of the McGovern clan until his death in 1584 (On 30 April 1605 King James VI and I had granted a pardon to him as "Brian McGaran of Tolaghagh", for fighting against the King's forces.). An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 24 October 1631 found that the said Brian Óg McGovern by deed of trust dated 20 November 1614 granted the lands of "Lissconnaught" (Irish= 'Lios Connachta', meaning "The Fort of the Descendants of Conn"), comprising 2 polls in Owengallees, 2 polls in Teeboy townland and a half poll in Bartonny, to the use of himself and his wife Mary O'Birn and after their death for their son Edmond McGovern, born in 1616. The said Brian Óg McGovern died on 1 October 1631.
The aforesaid McGovern lands in Teeboy were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Tewboy" with the proprietor being "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford".
A grant dated 7 July 1669 from King Charles II to John, Lord Viscount Massareene included 2 poles comprising three parcels of land being 345 acres 1 rood and 28 perches, 10 acres 1 rood of profitable land and 9 acres 2 roods and 32 perches of unprofitable land in "Toebegg".
A deed by Thomas Enery dated 29 Jan 1735 includes the lands of "Teeboy".
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Teeboy". A further deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774 includes the lands of "the two poles of Teebay".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Tewboy".
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Teeboy otherwise called Tuboy otherwise the two Tubboys".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list thirty-six tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance survey Namebooks state-"The soil is light and is intermixed with lime stone...There is a large lake on the east side of the townland".

Murder of Ján Kuciak

Ján Kuciak (17 May 1990 – 21 February 2018) was a Slovak investigative journalist. Kuciak worked as a reporter for the news website Aktuality.sk, focused mainly on investigating tax fraud of several businessmen with connections to top-level Slovak politicians. He and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, were shot dead in February 2018 in their home in Veľká Mača, Galanta District, Slovakia.
Kuciak was the first journalist murdered in Slovakia since the country's independence. The murders caused shock and disbelief throughout the country, sparking mass popular protests and a political crisis, with the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico on one side, and President Andrej Kiska and opposition parties on the other. The crisis culminated on 15 March with the resignation of Prime Minister Fico and his entire cabinet, followed by the forming of a new cabinet led by Peter Pellegrini.
According to the prosecution's indictment, well-known businessman Marian Kočner tasked Alena Zsuzsová with arranging Kuciak's murder, and she in turn tasked Zoltán Andruskó, who ordered Tomáš Szabó and Miroslav Marček to carry out the murder. Andruskó, a businessman from Chotín, admitted to ordering the murder, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Marček, a former soldier, admitted to shooting Kuciak and Kušnírová and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. His cousin Tomáš Szabó, a former policeman, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for participating in the murder. 
The case is to be retried by the Special Criminal Court, after Kočner and Zsuzsová's acquittal was overturned by the Supreme Court on 15 June 2021. 
Background.
Ján Kuciak was born on 17 May 1990 in the village of Štiavnik in Bytča District. He studied and graduated with a master's degree in journalism at the University of Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra, where he continued his studies as a postgraduate student in the field of mass media communication. While working on his PhD, he also held a teaching position at the same faculty.
He later started to work for the newspaper "Hospodárske noviny", before taking up a position in the editorial office of "Aktuality.sk", primarily as an investigative journalist. He particularly focused on cases of tax evasion, including ones related to the then-ruling party Direction - Social Democracy headed by PM Robert Fico. He had previously written about companies with unclear ownership as well as suspected systemic embezzlement from European Union funds.
The most prominent subject of his articles was businessman Marian Kočner, who first became known in Slovakia in 1998 due to his unsuccessful attempt to take over the private television news network TV Markíza with the help of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS). In his June 2017 articles, Kuciak described several discrepancies in the halted investigation of a case involving Kočner and the suspicious transfers of his hotels in Donovaly, which resulted in a €8 million VAT refund in 2010-2012. On 5 September 2017, Kočner phoned Kuciak and confronted him over his work, using profanities and saying that he would start gathering damaging information about Kuciak and his family. Two days later Kuciak filed a complaint against Kočner, but was not spoken to about the issue by police until over a month later. Kočner was accused of tax and insurance premiums evasion in the Donovaly case in late September 2017. 
In a December 2017 article, Kuciak described suspicious activity in a legal case in which Kočner’s firm IIDH was suing pharmaceutical distribution company Unipharma and its subsidiary for €45 million. In response, the Ministry of Justice launched an investigation into the actions of the judge involved in the case. In the last article published before his death, Kuciak wrote about suspicious transactions involving Kočner in the Bratislava apartment building Five Star Residence. According to the article, 19 apartments were sold to and from five different firms fully or partially controlled by Kočner at least twice, raising questions about possible tax-related criminal activity.
Death.
At the time of his death, Kuciak was 27 years old. He lived in the village of Veľká Mača, about 65 km (40 miles) east of the capital Bratislava. On the morning of 26 February 2018, police were called to his home by family members after the couple had not answered phone calls for more than four days. Kuciak's fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. The family stated that Kušnírová's cellphone appeared to switch off three days later, probably due to a dead battery.
Police entering the house found Kuciak and Kušnírová shot dead. Kuciak had been shot twice in the chest, while Kušnírová had been shot once in the head from the front. Both were shot at close range with a 9 mm caliber handgun. There was no evidence of a struggle and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Police found two empty cartridges at the crime scene as well as several unused bullets. The murders were initially believed to have been committed some time between February 22 and 25, but were subsequently suspected to have taken place in the evening of February 21.
Reactions.
The murders sent shockwaves throughout Slovakia. The day after the news broke, gatherings were held around the country in tribute. Candles were lit at the Slovak National Uprising Square in Bratislava and in front of the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak worked. Similar gatherings were also organised in the Czech cities of Prague and Brno. President Andrej Kiska stated that he was "shocked and horrified that something like this happened in Slovakia". Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament, called on Slovakia to launch a thorough investigation, offering international support if needed, adding that "the European Parliament will not rest until justice is done". Ringier Axel Springer, the parent company of Aktuality.sk, called the murders a "cruel assassination", vowing to redouble their journalistic efforts.
Protests.
On Friday 2 March, up to 25,000 people gathered in Bratislava to commemorate the murdered couple. On 9 March, protests were held in 48 towns and cities in Slovakia as well as 17 other cities around the world. In Bratislava alone, about 60,000 people held a protest march, the biggest turnout of any demonstration since the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The protests were endorsed by several universities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, teachers, school associations, artists and non-governmental organizations. 21 universities cancelled afternoon lectures to allow students and employees to attend the protests.
Two days after Prime Minister Fico's resignation, an even larger demonstration was held in Bratislava with over 65,000 people participating under slogans such as "Enough of Smer" and "Early elections". Former Speaker of Parliament and ex-presidential candidate František Mikloško made an impassioned speech during the protest saying that "the revolution started by the parents has to be finished by their children". He argued that only twice in the history of post-war Czechoslovakia have popular protests managed to make the government resign: in November 1989 and now, adding that "when somebody tries to abuse their power in the future, they should remember March 2018 and the mass protests". Mikloško's speech was accompanied by the ringing of keys, reminiscent of the Velvet Revolution in 1989.
Investigation.
In a press conference the same morning, Slovak Police President Tibor Gašpar stated that the murders "likely have something to do with [Kuciak’s] investigative activities". The Government of Slovakia offered €1 million for information leading to the murderers. Prime Minister Robert Fico made the announcement during a press conference with Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar. During the press conference, described by critics as "surreal" and "bizarre", they displayed packs of banknotes amounting to one million euros, which the government promised to give to anyone who came forward with relevant information that could help explain the murder. Furthermore, Prime Minister Fico announced the creation of an inter-agency task force involving employees of the General Prosecutor's Office, Special Prosecutor's Office, the Interior Ministry and the SIS in attempting to solve the case.
At the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the Italian organized crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta. He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling Smer-SD party. On 28 February, "Aktuality.sk" published Kuciak's last, unfinished story. The article details the activities of Italian businessmen with ties to organised crime who have settled in eastern Slovakia, and have spent years embezzling European Union funds intended for the development of this relatively poor region, as well as their connections to high-ranking state officials, such as Viliam Jasaň, a deputy and the Secretary of the State Security Council of Slovakia, or Mária Trošková, a former nude model who became Chief Adviser of Prime Minister Robert Fico. Both Jasaň and Trošková took leave of absence on the same day, stating that they would return to their positions once the investigations were concluded.
Initial arrests.
On 1 March, four days after the discovery of the murders, heavily armed units from the Slovak Police Corps' elite National Crime Agency (NAKA) raided several locations in eastern Slovakia, in the cities of Michalovce and Trebišov. Antonino Vadalà, an Italian businessman mentioned in Kuciak's report, was detained along with his two brothers Sebastiano and Bruno, as well as his cousin Pietro Caprotta and several other men of Italian origin. All the detained men were released from custody after 48 hours, due to lack of sufficient evidence. On the day of the arrests, General Prosecutor Jaromír Čižnár ordered the police to give no further updates to the press or the public regarding the investigation. Vadalà was rearrested on 13 March, this time due to an international warrant issued by the Italian police. According to the arrest warrant, Vadalà is suspected of drug trafficking as well as money laundering. Among other offences, he was said to have been planning to import large quantities of cocaine from South America. On 23 April, Slovakia approved Italy's request for extradition.
As a result of their investigation into the murder, the Slovak police stated that Kuciak had been murdered because of his work as an investigative journalist, and that the murder was a contract killing.
Arrests made in September.
On 17 September 2018 the prosecutor published a facial composite (identikit) of a person who allegedly could have been involved in the assassination, or may have information about people closely connected to the crime. The prosecutor added that the murder had been carried out by professionals as a contract killing. A man from Veľká Mača named Marek claiming to know the person from the image was subsequently questioned by police. He said it was his former colleague Miroslav Č., then living in Ostrava, who told the media that he did not understand why he was on the identikit.
On 27 September 2018, heavily-armed elite forces from the National Crime Agency (NAKA) arrested eight suspects in Kolárovo. Three of them, Tomáš Szabó, Miroslav Marček, and Zoltán Andruskó, were charged with the murder and other crimes, and the others were released. Minister Denisa Saková announced that around 200 individuals had been questioned in relation to the murder. The attorney of Ján Kuciak's family, Daniel Lipšic, commented that "the scale of the investigation, even with help of Europol and other foreign investigative organisations, was unprecedented".
On Friday 28 September 2018, Alena Zsuzsová was also arrested in relation to the murder, and became the fourth person to be charged with the murder. It became clear that releasing the identikit was a tactical move by the police. The man pictured was related to one of the accused and after the identikit was released the suspects started to communicate more intensively.
On 30 September 2018 the prosecution's motion to take all four accused into custody was approved by the Special Criminal Court in Banská Bystrica.
Subsequent investigation.
On 4 October 2018, Lívia Kňažíková, the attorney of Zoltán Andruskó, confirmed that he was cooperating with police, and had named Marian Kočner as the individual ordering the killing.
On 14 March 2019, Kočner was charged with ordering the murder. At the time, Kočner was already in custody in relation to the case of forging of promissory notes involving TV Markíza.
On 11 April 2019, Miroslav Marček told police that he was the one who shot Kuciak and Kušnírová, which disproved an earlier theory that Szabó was the shooter and Marček the driver.
Political crisis.
The same day the murder was announced, Prime Minister Fico called on the political opposition not to "exploit" the situation. Meanwhile, a number of opposition politicians accused the ruling Smer-SD party of indirect involvement. Member of Parliament Veronika Remišová, from the opposition OĽaNO party, compared the killings to the infamous murder of Róbert Remiáš, a police officer who was assassinated in 1996, in an act widely believed to have been a contract killing by the Slovak mafia on the orders of Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. On 27 February, Freedom and Solidarity and OĽaNO demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar. 
The crisis escalated on 4 March when President Kiska made a live broadcast on state television, warning the government against further polarising the country. He called for either a "radical cabinet reshuffle" or a snap election. Kiska's speech infuriated Fico, who accused him of "joining the opposition". Furthermore, he accused the president of conspiring with Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros in the planning of a coup d'etat, based on the fact that President Kiska met with Soros at Soros' apartment in New York City in September 2017, ostensibly to discuss issues related to the Roma minority.
On 28 February, two days after the news of Kuciak's murder broke, Minister of Culture Marek Maďarič announced his resignation. Announcing his decision to the press, Maďarič stated that "as a culture minister, I can't cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my tenure." Robert Kaliňák, Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister, resigned on 12 March 2018 after weeks of mounting pressure. The Most-Híd party, the junior coalition partner in the government, had demanded the resignation of Kaliňák in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD. The next day, Most-Híd joined the calls for snap elections, announcing that it would leave the government if it failed to reach a deal with its two coalition partners, Smer-SD and the Slovak National Party (SNS). Most-Híd Chairman, Béla Bugár, announced the decision after an eight-hour session of the Most-Hid Republican Council, the party's decision-making body.
Fico resigns.
On 14 March, following a meeting with President Kiska, Prime Minister Fico announced that he would resign to avoid early elections and "solve the political crisis". During the meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions to be met by the President in order for him to resign, including that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Smer-SD, as the largest party in parliament, would name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind, widely reported in Slovak media as Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of Fico and his cabinet, and tasked Pellegrini with the forming of a new government.
Continued protests.
On 22 March 2018, President Andrej Kiska appointed a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. Tomáš Drucker, former Minister of Health, was appointed Minister of Interior. Protest organisers announced on the same day via Facebook that they were cancelling the upcoming "For a Decent Slovakia" protest, and that they were forming a civic platform while closely watching the new government's next steps. 
Three days later they announced that if Drucker did not remove Police President Tibor Gašpar from office, protests would start again. On 28 March, they announced further protests. Around 30,000 people protested in Bratislava on 5 April. Drucker resigned on 16 April, saying that after a three-week assessment he did not agree with dismissing Gašpar, and would not remain as minister if it polarized society. The next day, Pellegrini and Gašpar announced that they agreed that Gašpar would step down at the end of May in order to calm the tensions. 
On 26 April President Kiska appointed Denisa Saková Minister of Interior. After Gašpar's departure, Milan Lučanský became acting Police President, before being confirmed on 15 April 2019.
Criminal proceedings.
First-degree court trial.
On 30 December 2019, one of the accused, Zoltán Andruskó, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after striking a deal with prosecutors. Andruskó pleaded guilty to all charges against him, and agreed to be a witness for the prosecution in the trials of the other defendants. Due to his cooperation with the murder investigation, the prosecutor proposed a reduction in his sentence from the usual sentence given for these crimes (25 years or life sentence) to 10 years in prison, though this proposal was rejected by the court. The court requested a sentence of 15 years in prison, which Andruskó accepted. His prison sentence began the same day.
The trial of Marian Kočner, Alena Zsuzsová, Tomáš Szabó and Miroslav Marček began on 13 January 2020 at the Special Criminal Court in Pezinok. The 2016 murder of Peter Molnár, a businessman from Kolárovo, was included in the case.
On 6 April 2020, Marček was sentenced to 23 years in prison after his case was allocated a separate trial. The prosecutor appealed against the sentence, after which the Supreme Court increased Marček's sentence to 25 years.
The trial of Kočner, Zsuzsová and Szabó lasted 22 days. In a verdict delivered on 3 September 2020, Tomáš Szabó was found guilty of involvement in the murder of Kuciak and Kušnírová, the murder of Peter Molnár, and of unauthorised carrying of weapons, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Marian Kočner was found guilty of unauthorised carrying of weapons and given a fine of €5,000. Kočner and Alena Zsuzsová were acquitted of charges related to the murders of Kuciak and Kušnírová. The court stated that their involvement in the murders was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The court explained its verdict by stating that not a single piece of direct evidence was put forward against Kočner, with the indictment being built on a series of circumstantial evidence; the only direct evidence against Zsuzsová was the testimony of Zoltán Andruskó. The prosecutor immediately appealed against the court's ruling to acquit Kočner and Zsuzsová. 
Following the verdict, Kočner remained in prison, having been sentenced by a first-degree court to 19 years in a case of forging of promissory notes involving Markíza - Slovakia. Zsuzsová was released and immediately re-arrested, as she is charged with involvement in the attempted murders of prosecutor Maroš Žilinka, Daniel Lipšic, and prosecutor Peter Šufliarsky. The Special Criminal Court in Banská Bystrica ordered custody for Zsuzsová on 5 September 2020, and extended it on 16 March 2021.
Various public officials (domestic and international), media representatives, and organizations reacted negatively to this ruling. President Zuzana Čaputová wrote on Facebook that she was shocked by the verdict and needed to understand its explanation, adding that she respected it but expected that the case would not end and would continue to the Supreme Court. Prime Minister Igor Matovič stated on Facebook: "It seems that for now the apparent instigators of the murder would like to slip out of the clutches of justice… Let’s believe that justice will wait for them both."
Appeal.
The supervising prosecutor submitted his appeal to the Supreme Court on 23 October 2020. In the appeal, he reasoned that the first-degree court refused to take into account crucial evidence, that the court's reasoning was wrong and based on unclear and incomplete findings, and that the court did not deal with all circumstances important for the verdict. He further argued that in coming to its decision the court used evidence which was not presented before the court during the trial. He contested the court's reasoning about the unreliability of witnesses Andruskó and Tóth, as well as the court's failure to correctly assess the conflicting statements made by Kočner and Zsuzsová, among other arguments against the verdict. He proposed that the Supreme Court return the case to the Special Criminal Court to be retried by a different three-judge panel, suggesting that additional witnesses be called and additional evidence be considered. Kuciak's parents and their attorney identified with all proposals made by the prosecutor. Kušnírová's mother and her attorney Roman Kvasnica also appealed against the verdict, again asking the Supreme Court to order the case to be reconsidered by the Special Criminal Court, this time by a different three-judge panel.
The case was allocated to a three-judge panel at the Supreme Court on 16 November 2020.
On 4 December 2020, Zsuzsová was convicted by a first-degree court of participation in the 2010 murder of László Basternák, ex-mayor of Hurbanovo. She was sentenced to 21 years in prison. On 12 January 2021, the Supreme Court confirmed the sentence of 19 years and a €10,000 fine for Kočner in the case of forging of promissory notes involving Markíza - Slovakia. He therefore also remained in prison. Other criminal proceedings are ongoing against both.
Peter Kubina replaced Daniel Lipšic as the attorney of Kuciak's parents, as Lipšic was elected Special Prosecutor of the Slovak Republic on 5 February 2021.
On 15 June 2021, the Supreme Court confirmed the sentence of 25 years in a maximum-security prison for Szabó and overturned the acquittal of Kočner and Zsuzsová, returning the case to the Special Criminal Court for further consideration. The court explained its decision by noting that the first-degree court came to its verdict prematurely, did not clearly establish the facts of the case, did not deal with all circumstances of the case, did not intelligibly explain its verdict, did not consider all the evidence, evaluated the evidence which it did consider in an unlawful manner which led to an incorrect legal conclusion resulting in acquittal, and unlawfully evaluated evidence not presented before the court during the trial. The Supreme Court further reasoned that the first-degree court evaluated the evidence in a manner at odds with elementary logic, instead of describing and chronologically evaluating the evidence. The case will be retried by the same three-judge panel of the first-degree court whose ruling was overturned. The prosecution, the parents of Kuciak and Kušnírová, and various Slovak public officials including President Čaputová welcomed the verdict.

Planned murders.
Collaborating with the investigators, Zoltán Andruskó described the planned murders of prosecutor Maroš Žilinka, Daniel Lipšic and prosecutor Peter Šufliarsky. According to Andruskó, Zsuzsová ordered the murders of Žilinka and Lipšic in autumn 2017 and paid him a €20,000 deposit. They were to be killed at the same time if they met, and if not, Žilinka was to be prioritized. The promised sums for the murders were €70,000 for the murder of Žilinka (with an extra €10,000 promised for the murder of each of his family members) and €200,000 for the murder of Lipšic. After being turned down by certain Hungarians, Andruskó went on to task Szabó and Marček with these murders. They accepted but did not act for two months. He then asked his acquaintance Dušan Kracina from Komárno to arrange Žilinka's murder. Kracina allegedly arranged the murder with Serbian accomplices, but Andruskó halted it shortly before it was carried out, out of fear. Andruskó kept telling Zsuzsová that the murders were still being planned. She then ordered the murder of Ján Kuciak through Andruskó, which was carried out by Szabó and Marček.
In summer 2018, Zsuzsová tasked Andruskó with the murder of prosecutor Peter Šufliarsky, for which she promised a €100,000 reward. Szabó and Marček were supposed to carry out the murder, initially planning to use an explosive planted in a garbage can in front of Šufliarsky's house. Andruskó was unable to acquire an explosive, so they acquired a gun. They monitored Šufliarsky until their arrest in September 2018 in the Kuciak case.
These crimes were initially included in the investigation of the murders of Kuciak and Kušnírová. The investigation was reallocated by Minister of Interior Denisa Saková to the Ministry of Interior's Office of the Inspection Service in February 2019, an action Lipšic criticized. In September 2020, the case was returned to the National Criminal Agency (NAKA) for investigation. Žilinka and Šufliarsky have said they believe the motive behind the ordering of their murders was their prosecution work. Lipšic expressed the belief that the person who ordered his murder was Kočner. As of June 2021, the individuals charged with these crimes are Kočner, Zsuzsová, Szabó, Kracina and a Bosnian national identified as Darko Dragić.
Surveillance of journalists.
Marian Kočner, Peter Tóth, and three men who formed a group organized by Tóth, were charged with misdemeanors by the National Criminal Agency over the surveillance of a group of individuals, mainly journalists, among them Ján Kuciak. The misdemeanor with which they are charged is classified in Slovak law as a "violation of the confidentiality of oral speech, and of the confidentiality of other manifestations of a personal nature".
Awards and legacy.
Ján Kuciak was given various awards:
The association Investigative Center of Ján Kuciak (ICJK) began their activity in January 2019. Its goals are uncovering organized crime and its connections to politicians or public institutions, and cooperation with other investigative centers (such as OCCRP).
In popular culture.
"Scumbag" (Slovak: "Sviňa") is a 2020 thriller directed by Mariana Čengel-Solčanská and Rudolf Biermann, based on the novel of the same name by Arpád Soltész. Both the novel and the film were partially inspired by Kuciak's murder and related events.

Janus v. AFSCME

Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, No. 16-1466, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), abbreviated Janus v. AFSCME, was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court on US labor law, concerning the power of labor unions to collect fees from non-union members. Under the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, which applies to the private sector, union security agreements can be allowed by state law. The Supreme Court ruled that such union fees in the public sector violate the First Amendment right to free speech, overturning the 1977 decision in "Abood v. Detroit Board of Education" that had previously allowed such fees.
Background.
"Abood v. Detroit Board of Education".
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 authorized trade unions in the private sector to be established to represent employees in collective bargaining for wages and other benefits from employers. Frequently, unions also engage in political activity to support their goals by donating to political campaigns. These activities are paid for through fees and dues collected from its members. Some unions are also able to collect fees from non-members in the same workplace through agency shop or union equity agreements. Within the public sector (unions that include members working for state and local governments), which are governed by individual state laws, the use of such agreements had been previously allowed by the Supreme Court in "Abood v. Detroit Board of Education", , which determined that as long as such dues collected from non-members was used only for the union's purposes of collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment, it did not violate the non-members' First Amendment of the United States Constitution. It was also determined in "Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild Inc.", , that private-sector unions have a duty of fair representation to all workers in a bargaining unit under the National Labor Relations Act, and that unions were allowed to negotiate agreements which state that "membership" was required as a condition of continued employment, even though the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 had outlawed agreements requiring formal union membership. About 22 states have unions with these collective agreements in place that apply to their public sector workers.
Challenges to "Abood".
Since about 2006, with the appointment of Justice Samuel Alito which gave the Court a conservative advantage, groups opposing agency fees, such as the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, have brought cases challenging "Abood". These groups contended that within the public sector, all union activities could be considered political since they ultimately seek to influence government policy, and thus violate the First Amendment.
In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in "Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000", , which considered a "Temporary Special Assessment to Create a Political Fight-Back Fund" imposed upon a class of 42,000 State of California employees who were nonmembers, the Court held that a union had violated their rights by collecting fees in the absence of the notice and procedural requirements of "Teachers Local No. 1 v. Hudson", 475 U.S. 292 (1986). While the case did not directly challenge "Abood", the Court called into question the continued viability of "Abood", as well as an earlier decision, "Machinists v. Street", 367 U.S. 740 (1961), stating that “dissent is not to be presumed—it must affirmatively be made known to the union by the dissenting employee," which has been used by unions to justify payment of full union dues from nonmembers who do not, in addition to remaining nonmembers, object to paying fees equal to full union dues.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in "Harris v. Quinn", , which considered the validity of an agency fee policy affecting home health care workers receiving public funds in the state of Illinois; the Court held that the health care workers were not public-sector employees and thus could not be required to pay agency fees. While the Court did not rule directly on the First Amendment challenges to "Abood" in this decision, the majority opinion questioned the validity of "Abood". Justice Alito, writing for the Court, stated in the decision from "Harris" that within the public sector, every activity of a public sector union could be considered political. "In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pensions, and benefits are important political issues, but that is generally not so in the private sector. ... [A]s state and local expenditures on employee wages and benefits have mushroomed, the importance of the difference between bargaining in the public and private sectors has been driven home."
Procedural history.
The immediate case began in 2015 when newly-elected Illinois governor Bruce Rauner took office. Rauner had run on an anti-union platform, and once in office, he issued an executive order that suspended collection of agency fees from non-union members who benefitted from a contract negotiated by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represented Illinois public sector employees. Rauner also preemptively filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the AFSCME to challenge agency shop agreements as unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment. (Case 15-C-1235). Rauner used the decision from "Harris" to support these actions, arguing that agency-shop agreements violate nonmembers' right to free speech. Rauner's executive order and comptroller instructions were challenged by AFSCME and other unions.
In Rauner's federal case, the unions sought to dismiss the case, claiming he had no standing. In May 2015, the District Court judge found that Rauner lacked sufficient standing to issue the challenge, as he had "no personal interest at stake." Three state employees attempted to join the suit as co-plaintiffs, but the judge denied this order. Instead, the judge allowed the case to continue with the three employees as the sole plaintiffs. These employees included Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist, who had contested the fees. 
Janus claimed that he should not need to pay fees to AFSCME because doing so constitutes paying for political speech with which Janus disagrees. Under Illinois law, state government can require its employees to pay fees to a government union as a condition of employment. In March 2015, the three government employees represented by attorneys from the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center and Virginia-based National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation took legal action to intervene in the case. In May 2015, after Rauner was dropped from the case, it proceeded under the name Janus v. AFSCME.
Meanwhile, the case of "Friedrichs v. California Teachers Ass'n", , had been working its way to the Supreme Court, which dealt with a similar complaint. In July 2015, after "Friedrichs" had been issued certiorari by the Supreme Court, the Illinois suit was put on hold pending "Friedrichs". The Supreme Court heard the case, which challenged the Ninth's Circuit's decision affirming "Abood." Before the Court could issue the decision, however, Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, and the case was decided 4–4, leaving in place the Ninth Circuit decision. Observers believed that the Court would have likely ruled against agency fees based on the progression of the case.
With no decision from "Friedrichs", the Illinois cases were restarted. A new complaint was filed by Janus and other plaintiffs, alleging that the fees they paid under an agency-shop agreement violated their First Amendment rights. The unions sought to dismiss the case, arguing that "Abood" was settled law. The District Court dismissed the case. On appeal in May 2017, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling to dismiss the case on the basis of "Abood". (16-3638).
Supreme Court.
On April 10, 2017, Neil Gorsuch was appointed to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Gorsuch was widely expected to side with conservative bloc, who ruled against the unions in "Friedrichs". Observers believed that based on the past deliberations, the decisions in "Harris" and "Friedrichs", and Gorsuch's conservative jurisprudence, "Janus" would likely prevail before the Supreme Court. Janus petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, which was granted on September 28, 2017. The Supreme Court heard the oral argument of the parties on February 26, 2018.
Opinion of the Court.
On June 27, 2018, the Court ruled in a 5–4 decision that the application of public sector union fees to non-members is a violation of the First Amendment, ruling against AFSCME. Justice Alito wrote for the Court, joined by Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, and Gorsuch. Alito wrote that agency-shop agreements violate "the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern." Alito recognized that losing these fees would put a financial burden on the public sector unions, who would continue to have to represent nonmembers even without their agency fees, but stated that "we must weigh these disadvantages against the considerable windfall that unions have received." In the decision, the Court held that the conclusion reached by "Abood" was inconsistent with the First Amendment and thus overruled that decision.
Dissent.
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Kagan criticized the majority opinion as one that "overthrows a decision ["Abood"] entrenched in this nation’s law — and in its economic life — for over 40 years." Justice Sotomayor wrote her own separate dissent, critical of the weight given to First Amendment protections that had been established in "Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.", and subsequently used by the Court in cases like "National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra", .
Subsequent developments.
Public-sector union officials predicted that they would lose 10 to 30 percent of their members and tens of millions of dollars in revenue in the states that would be affected. The nation's two largest public sector unions lost the vast majority of agency-fee payers after the ruling. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees went from 112,233 agency-fee payers to 2,215 (a 98% decline) while Service Employees International Union went from 104,501 to 5,812 (94%), as per 2018 filings. However, there was little change in numbers of dues-paying members, and AFSCME retained 94% of members and agency-fee payers.
Following the Supreme Court ruling, Mark Janus left his job with the state of Illinois to join the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative think tank that funded his case. 
Professionals in other fields have raised legal challenges to mandatory dues. For example, attorneys in Wisconsin have challenged the "integrated bar" requirement in their state, which (like more than half of U.S. states) requires all practicing attorneys to be dues-paying members of the state bar association, under the same reasoning as "Janus". The case, "Jarchow v. State Bar of Wisconsin", was initially dismissed by the Western District Court of Wisconsin. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's decisions and the plaintiffs subsequently appealed this case to the Supreme Court, where their writ of certiorari was denied on June 1, 2020 over the dissents of Justices Thomas and Gorsuch.
Award to Janus opposed.
Janus received the Whittaker Chambers Award from the National Review Institute – an award opposed by the family of Whittaker Chambers, which caused the NRI to discontinue the award two years after its creation.

Isluga River

Isluga River is a river in Chile and Bolivia, and is also known as Sitani or Arabilla. It starts at the confluence of the rivers Chaguane and Huinchuta and flows for before reaching the Laguna Mucalliri of the Salar de Coipasa. It receives water from the volcanoes Isluga, Cabaray and Quimsachata as well as the Sierra Uscana.
The watershed of the river lies mainly in Chile and has a dry climate, resulting in a small river discharge of about . There are a number of towns and hamlets in the catchment, as well as wetlands with a number of animal and plant species.
Course.
The Isluga River (also known as Sitani or Arabilla) begins at the southern foot of the high Cerro Alpajeres west of the town of Chaguane at the confluence of the Chaguane and Huinchuta. In its upper parts the Isluga River is also known as the Arabilla River. The Chaguane is long and receives water from the Laguna Parinacota, which in turn is nourished from two creeks that join it from the west and north. The Huinchuta (also known as Pasijro) is also long but comes from the northwest and turns south before joining the Chaguane.
After the confluence, the Isluga River proceeds in southeast-eastward direction save for a brief turn northeast, past the towns of Chaguane and Arabilla; between the two the Quebrada Taipicollo joins from the northwest. After Arabilla it turns more eastward and receives waters from the Laguna Arabilla farther south; the Isluga River here passes through wetland territory. It flows past the towns of Chapicollo, Enquelca and Coraguane before turning sharply to the south. After this turn the river continues first southeast-east, then due east between Cachaguano and Isluga where it has a slight northeasterly tilt, and finally southeastward towards Sitani and Cotasaya. The penultimate part of the river runs irregularly eastward towards Colchani and Pisigua. After a total course of before ending into the Laguna Mucalliri, which is part of a system of wetlands at Salar de Coipasa. The Cariquima River ends into the same general area and is sometimes considered to be part of the Rio Isluga. From that area, the Sitani River continues into the Salar de Coipasa proper.
The Isluga River is entrenched between river terraces. It receives several tributaries that drain the Quimsachata, Isluga and Cabaray from the north; the Alsare from Cabaray is a major tributary. From the south it receives tributaries from the Sierra Uscana, including the long Mauque which joins the Isluga River in the Fisica Choque/Chaque wetland.
Watershed.
The Isluga River drains of Chile's Tarapaca Region and a further of Bolivia, and lies at an average elevation of elevation. The catchment of Isluga is more gentle than Pacific-draining catchments, resulting in the formation of wetlands.
The region has an arid climate. Most precipitation arrives from the Amazon and falls mainly during the summer months. This results in the region having a steppe vegetation above elevation with about precipitation. Above elevation lies a montane desert climate with precipitation amounting to . During the Quaternary, the Altiplano was at times wetter than today, resulting in the formation of lakes.
Much of the watershed is dominated by Oligocene to Quaternary age volcanic rocks formed by basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite. In the central and eastern parts there are also sedimentary formations of Pleistocene to Holocene, including alluvial and lacustrine deposits; these sedimentary formations are concentrated in the central parts of the catchment high Isluga volcano is still active, with eruptions in 1900 and 1963; other important mountains are the high Cabaray and the high Cerro El Fraile.
During the Pliocene-Pleistocene, tectonic uplift raised the Altiplano to heights of over . A number of endorheic systems such as the Lauca River and the Isluga River drain the Altiplano. Part of the Isluga catchment was covered by lakes, which have left wetlands and small lakes.
Discharge.
Water temperatures at Ríos Arabilla at elevation range . The salinity is dominated by chloride, sodium and sulfate owing to high evaporation and the dissolution of salts in the catchment. The waters are eutrophic.
A stream gauge was active at Bocatoma (between the towns of Isluga and Sitani) between 1995 and 2001, and at Puente in 1998. At Bocatoma discharge is fairly constant with the exception of the spring months; average runoff is about but can increase to over or decrease to less than . A more recent report indicated a discharge of at the Bocatoma station.
Biology.
Plankton is dominated on the floral side by bacillariophyceae such as "Navicula" and "Synedra" while the faunal side is characterized by cladocerans ("Alona" and "Bosmina"), copepods ("Boeckella"), ostracods in shallower parts and rotifers.
Coleoptera of the genus "Australelmis" and chironomid flies further populate the waters. The fish "Orestias agassii" and "Trichomycterus" pencil catfishes such as "Trichomycterus rivulatus" live in its waters. These fish are all vulnerable or at the risk of extinction. The Peru water frog has also been found, as are several mollusc species of the taxa chilinidae and veneroida and snails of the genus "Heleobia".
A number of different plant species grow in the waters of the Isluga River, such as "Carex", "Catabrosa verdermanni", "Deschampsia caespitosa", "Deyeuxia curvula", "Drabella", "Distichia muscoides", "Distichlis humilis", "Eleocharis", "Festuca nardifolia", "Juncus", "Lilaeopsis lineata", "Oxychloe andina", "Potamogeton strictum", "Ranunculus", "Sarcocornia pulvinata", "Scirpus atacamensis" and "Triglochin palustris". The wetlands along the river are an important environment in the Altiplano.
The steppes surrounding the catchment feature a flora which includes quenoa and yareta; depending on the availability of water different places are dominated by different plants. Among the fauna are flamingos and vicuñas, lizards of the genus "Liolaemus", the frog "Pleurodema marmoratum" and the toad "Rhinella spinulosa". The amphibian and reptile faunas are little known, unlike the bird fauna.
Human activity.
The towns of Colchane, Isluga and Pisiga lie in the watershed, which is part of the commune of Colchane. There are further hamlets and villages in the catchment of the Isluga River. Most of the watershed is undeveloped, with agriculture being the main form of land use.
Wetlands in the catchment were important for pastoralism, which along with tourism of the Volcán Isluga National Park is an important economic resource for the area. Irrigation takes place in the watershed, but there is little information on it. An old plan of a transbasin diversion envisaged transferring water from the headwaters of the Isluga River to the Quebrada de Camiña by way of a tunnel to increase the water supply to the Camiña valley. Concerns have been raised in 2011 in Bolivia about diversions of the Isluga River.
History.
During the 16th century the Isluga region was part of the Caranga confederation, which extended to Lake Poopo. The Spanish Crown at that time was pursuing a plan to concentrate the native population in towns; in 1578 the border between the Corregimiento de Arica and Corregimiento de Caranga was drawn across the watershed and coincides with the present-day Chile-Bolivia border.

Mikio Ikemoto

 is a Japanese manga artist. He originally worked as the chief assistant for Masashi Kishimoto's manga series "Naruto" from 1999 to 2014. After its conclusion, Ikemoto was chosen to illustrate the 2016 sequel series, "", working alongside writer Ukyō Kodachi.
Biography and works.
As a child Ikemoto was a fan of "Bikkuriman" stickers. However, since he could not afford them, he instead drew his own stickers. Ikemoto's friends enjoyed them so much that they started buying stickers from him. By this point of his life, Ikemoto felt he had the talent for art.
In March 1997, Mikio Ikemoto submitted his first one-shot manga, titled "Cosmos", to the manga magazine "Weekly Shōnen Jump", for which he won a Tenkaichi Manga Award. The one-shot was later published in the July 7 issue of the magazine, gaining a small cult following despite its mature subject matter. "Cosmos" was then serialized in "Monthly Plasma", an independent manga magazine, from June 1997 to September 1999, and a sequel one-shot was published in the April 26, 1999 issue of "Weekly Shōnen Jump".
By this time Ikemoto had become interested in the work of fellow rookie manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. Upon hearing that Ikemoto had been contacted by Shueisha to work as an assistant on a comedy series and was moving to Tokyo, Kishimoto felt that his art would be wasted on that genre. With work beginning on the "Naruto" serialization, Kishimoto asked his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, to scout Ikemoto and recruit him as an assistant. Ikemoto was grateful for the offer, since he felt that "Naruto"s genre was what he had originally wanted to work on, and accepted the job, beginning work with the seventh chapter. During the early days of making "Naruto", Ikemoto was Kishimoto's youngest assistant, and the latter jokingly said this made him and his other assistants envious. Ikemoto's responsibilities included drawing crowds and background figures, adding white to speed lines, highlights and characters' eyes, whiting out art that went out of the panels, putting stars in night skies, and adding in half-tones. He was also occasionally tasked with creating the designs for new characters. Ikemoto recalls how often Kishimoto requested his help with adding more details to the manga chapters, leading him to draw more clones created by Naruto Uzumaki as well as an unspecified character who could become giant.
When the manga ended in 2014, Shueisha asked Kishimoto to start a sequel. However, Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed that Ikemoto draw it based on the experience he had. Kishimoto advised Ikemoto not to imitate his art style and instead make his own. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed with the fact that Kishimoto is not drawing , Ikemoto stated he would do his best in the making of the manga. Ikemoto mentioned he remained optimistic about his art style. Kishimoto also revises the manga's scenario. Besides illustrating the manga, Ikemoto also provides illustrations for the "Boruto" light novels. The manga had one million copies in print as of January 2017 while Studio Pierrot also produced an anime series based on it.
Style.
Aside from "Naruto", Ikemoto said his art was influenced by "Kinnikuman" and particularly "Dragon Ball". He noted that the lack of tone in Akira Toriyama's art makes drawing easier and said he still uses "Dragon Ball" as a reference for his own action scenes. Ikemoto admitted he is pretty bad at drawing comedy, but also noted that the way the story of "Boruto" has evolved does not lend itself well to comedy. While feeling honored to create the art for "Boruto", Ikemoto stated he feels grateful that the series is released monthly rather than weekly due to the stress the latter could bring since the required amount of pages is nearly 20 per chapter. However, Ikemoto still finds the monthly serialization challenging. Regular chapters of "Boruto" tend to surpass 40 pages, with one week required to create the thumbnails and 20 days to produce the pages while the rest of the time is used for coloring or giving the chapters other touches. His drawing methods involve criterium (Mechanical Pencil) on IC's paper for the sketches. He uses ink for finished drawings. Despite the differences between their art styles, Ikemoto uses Copic's markers for the colored pages, similarly to how Kishimoto did with "Naruto".
The 's director Hiroyuki Yamashita said he enjoys Ikemoto's style, praising his oblong landscape layout for frames. He found Ikemoto's style more realistic than Kishimoto's due to the former's attention to the character designs' details. He also pointed out that Ikemoto's way of illustrating Momoshiki Otsutsuki's new appearance after consuming Kinshiki Otsutsuki surprised him due to how different it was compared to the original design from the . Amy McNulty of "Anime News Network" shared similar comments, particularly regarding the way Ikemoto's art resembles Kishimoto's as well as how well-illustrated his fight scenes are. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi stated he enjoyed Ikemoto's artwork, praising his style.

Troutbeck (horse)

Troutbeck (1903–1930) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was beaten in three starts as a juvenile in 1905 but improved to become an exceptional racehorse in the following year. He won his first three races in 1906 before sustaining his only defeat of the season when finishing third in the Epsom Derby. He won his next five races including the Jersey Stakes and the Sussex Stakes before ending the year with a win in the St Leger. He remained in training at four but failed to win any major races although he did finish second in the Coronation Cup. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and the United States but was not a success at stud.
Background.
Troutbeck was a bay horse bred and owned by Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster at Eaton Hall in Cheshire. The colt was sent into training with William Waugh at the Kingsclere stable in Berkshire.
Troutbeck was one of the best horses sired by Ladas who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1894. His dam Rydal Mount was a daughter of the influential broodmare Rydal whose other descendants have included Molvedo, Niniski, Belmez, Bellypha and Pearl Diver.
Racing career.
1905: two-year-old season.
Troutbeck ran three times as a two-year-old but failed to win or place although he showed somepromise when coming home fourth behind the filly Colonia in the Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse in August.
1906: three-year-old season.
Troutbeck began his second season on 18 April at Newmarket Racecourse and recorded his first success by taking the 47th Newmarket Biennial Stakes. At Chester Racecourse in May the colt maintained his progress, winning two races including the Dee Stakes. On 30 May Troutbeck was one of twenty-two runners to contest the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles and started a 33/1 outsider. After disputing the lead from the start he went to the front in the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished third behind Spearmint and Picton, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. Shortly after winning the Duchess of York Plate at Hurst Park in June Troutbeck was dropped back in distance for the seven furlong Jersey Stakes Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Herbert Jones and won at odds of 4/7. Less than a week later he won the Sandringham Plate at Sandown Park to record his third victory in the space of ten days. In August the colt won for the seventh time as he took the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse at odds of 1/4, with Jones again in the saddle and then recorded yet another success in the City of London Breeders' Foal Plate at Kempton.
On 12 September at Doncaster Racecourse Troutbeck, ridden by the French jockey Georges Stern, started at 5/1 for the 131st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. The filly Keystone II started the 5/4 favourite while the other runners included Gorgos, Plum Tree (Goodwood Cup), Beppo and th French colt Storm (third in the Grand Prix de Paris). The start of the race was very untidy and saw several horses left behind but Troutbeck responded quickly, went to the front, and opened up a clear advantage over his rivals. Troubeck still held the lead entering the straight but Beppo and Keystone were now close behind and the unconsidered outsider Prince William began tomake rapid progress along the inside rail. The closing stages saw a "desperate struggle" with Troutbeck prevailing by a head from Prince William, with Beppo and Keystone a head and a neck away in third and fourth. The finish of the race was extremely rough, with much bumping and barging between the first four horses, leading one observer to remark that it resembled "a combination of skittles and polo".
Stern became the first French jockey to win one of the British Classic Races, while the winning time of 3:04.2 was a new record for the race.
1907: four-year-old season.
Troutbeck remained in training as a four-year-old in 1907. In the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June he finished second to The White Knight with Polymelus in third. He faced The White Knight again in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles but finished unplaced. In July at Lingfield he was beaten by the three-year-old Wool Winder in a two-horse race for the valuable Lingfield Park Plate, conceding 24 pounds to the winner. He was retired from racing shortly afterwards.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Troutbeck an "inferior" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Troutbeck began his stud career in England at an initial advertised fee of £49. After standing for several years in England he was sold for 460 guineas in 1917 and was exported to the United States in January 1920. He had little success as a sire of winner in either location. Troutbeck died in 1930.
