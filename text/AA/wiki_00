Klau and Buena Vista Mine Superfund site

The Klau/Buena Vista Mine is a Superfund site located approximately 12 miles west of Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, California. It consists of two abandoned mercury mine sites (Klau and Buena Vista) that are located on adjacent properties on a northwest–southeast ridge of the Santa Lucia Range in the California coastal mountains. Mercury mining and ore processing operations occurred at these mines between 1868 and 1970.
Episodic weather events left deep erosional channels throughout the site, thereby releasing mercury-laden sediment, which had contributed significant levels of mercury to downstream Las Tablas Creek and Lake Nacimiento Reservoir.
History.
The Klau Mine opened in 1868 and yielded nearly 18,000 flasks of mercury by 1940. Operation of the Buena Vista or Mahoney mine started in 1900 and was active until 1970. The Buena Vista mine produced more than 15,000 flasks of mercury. Buena Vista Mines, Inc. has owned the Buena Vista Mine at least since 1957 and the Klau Mine since at least 1964.
For more than 20 years, acid-contaminated water has drained from the mine into Las Tablas Creek. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) ordered the Buena Vista Mines, Inc. to stop discharging water or treat the water before it was released into the creek. In 1994, the company constructed an earthen holding pond to capture the mine water and evaporate it. The pond was built from an existing cattle pond, dug 12 feet deep, and designed to hold 1.5 million gallons of acid-contaminated water. In early 1995, San Luis Obispo County experienced heavy rains. Buena Vista Mines inspected the pond on March 24, 1995, and noticed that the water was one inch from the top. Using a water pump, they pumped out 180,000 gallons and lowered the water level about by 18 inches. David Schwartzbart, an engineering geologist for RWQCB, observed the water run down a concrete channel into the Las Tablas Creek. Schwartzbart tested the water and determined that it was highly acidic. After the criminal charges were brought, Buena Vista Mines constructed a second pond that had a 1,200,000-gallon capacity. They also installed a treatment facility that could treat 10,000 gallons of water per day.
In 1999, the RWQCB requested the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9's Emergency Response Office to assist in preventing the continued release of mercury-laden sediments and other contaminants from the site. Short-term removal work involved site stabilization, which reduced the discharge of acid mine drainage (AMD) and discharge into Las Tablas Creek. In 2000, EPA removed 120,000 cubic yards of contaminated materials from the drainage channel and secured it in an on-site repository to prevent immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 2002, EPA stabilized a sinkhole on site and also stabilized a slope failure on site. In 2006, EPA removed the mercury processing building (retort) and some mercury-laden soils. Contaminated materials stored on site are temporarily capped and will be addressed in the site's long-term cleanup.
Damage to fishery.
During an investigation conducted by California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in February–March 2006, elevated levels of mercury that pose health hazard were found in six species of fish from Lake Nacimiento. Water analysis has shown that the water is safe to drink and recreate in. However, mercury in the sediment has been converted to methylmercury by organisms living in the sediment and then there has been bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish in the lake.
Cleanup efforts.
EPA has spent about $6 million so far to contain the dangerous runoff from the Klau/Buena Vista. The owner, Buena Vista Mines, Inc., began the effort after years of court battles with the state water board. Shortly after the cleanup started, it became too expensive and the mining company quit. In 1999, RWQCB requested EPA to assist on preventing the release of the mercury-laden sediments to water reservoir. The cleanup is paid for by an EPA Superfund.
Legal actions.
It was alleged that the Buena Vista Mines, Inc. intentionally violated the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act by discharging pollutants into Las Tablas Creek which flows into Lake Nacimiento. On January 20, 1998, the Court of Appeal, 2nd District, Division 6, California dismissed the violations on the ground that the mine had established a defense of necessity.

Pashtun Tahafuz Movement

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM; "Paṣhtūn Zhghōrənē Ghōrźang"; ) is a social movement for Pashtun human rights based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The movement was founded in May 2014 by eight students in Dera Ismail Khan.
During PTM's public demonstrations and sit-ins, several demands were presented to the Pakistani government and military, including punishment to the retired police officer Rao Anwar, a truth and reconciliation commission on extrajudicial killings in the country, presenting missing persons before courts, and removal of landmines from the Pashtun tribal areas. The movement is led by Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen, a human rights activist from South Waziristan. Other prominent activists in it include Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar. PTM claims to be an unarmed and peaceful resistance movement working within the lawful boundaries of the Constitution of Pakistan. However, the Pakistan Army and several journalists have claimed that the movement is trying to create discord in the country along ethnic lines, as well as following a foreign agenda. The movement has seen strong support from neighboring Afghanistan, which traditionally has an uneasy relationship with the government of Pakistan.
History.
Background.
The secular "Pashtunistan" movement has been a sensitive issue since Pakistan's independence in 1947. A large Pashtun population exists in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to some scholars, Pakistani authorities have promoted Islamization as an opposing force. The PTM has however refrained from comment on Pashtun unity.
Pashtun territory has been a war zone since the 1980s, since the Cold War between the Soviet Union and United States and the following conflict between western and Islamist forces. The secular PTM therefore campaigns against war, blaming both Islamists and the Pakistani military for the destruction.
Early history.
The movement was founded as Mahsud Tahafuz Movement in May 2014 by eight students in Dera Ismail Khan. as an initiative for removing landmines from Waziristan and other parts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas, affected by the war in North-West Pakistan. 
The movement rose to prominence in January 2018 when it began a justice movement for Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was extrajudicially killed in a fake encounter staged by the police officer Rao Anwar in Karachi. When the movement gained popularity among the Pashtuns in late January 2018, the word "Mahsud" in its name, which referred to the Mahsud tribe from Waziristan, was changed into "Pashtun" to refer to all Pashtuns.
The movement, which has inspired global Pashtun solidarity, has been dominated by youth, and thrives on social media while lacking significant coverage in mainstream media. According to Saleem Shah, it has challenged military power where typical Pashtun nationalist parties have not dared. However, the PTM lacks organizational structure and a political manifesto, as of 2018.
In November 2018, PTM launched a justice movement for Tahir Dawar, a police officer and Pashto poet who was abducted from the capital Islamabad and tortured to death, with his corpse found 18 days after disappearance in the Dur Baba District of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. PTM, as well as Tahir's family, demanded that Tahir's murder must be investigated through an international commission rather than a Pakistani one because the case involved two countries. PTM again gained international press coverage in February 2019 when the Balochistan Police allegedly extrajudicially murdered one of the leaders of PTM, Arman Loni, in Loralai. Protests followed which led to the detention of more than 20 PTM activists, including Gulalai Ismail and Abdullah Nangyal. In May 2020, after the assassination of PTM leader Arif Wazir, another wave of widespread protests was held during which several PTM activists, including Gilaman and Nadeem Askar, were arrested by Pakistani authorities. The Pashteen hat (also known as the Mazari hat) has become the most iconic symbol of PTM, as Manzoor Pashteen regularly wears it at public rallies and events.
Kharqamar incident.
On 26 May 2019, PTM members including Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, the two PTM members in the Parliament of Pakistan, protested in the Kharqamar area of Datta Khel Subdivision, North Waziristan. The PTM claimed that the gathering had been organized by peaceful and unarmed activists to protest against the beating up of a woman by the military on May 25 and other human rights abuses in the area, but the military alleged that the PTM leaders instead wanted to “exert pressure for release of suspected terrorists’ facilitators”. As the military forces shot into the PTM protest gathering, more than 13 PTM supporters were killed and over 25 others injured. However, according to Pakistani military, five Pakistani soldiers were injured as result of PTM members firing. Following the incident several PTM members, including Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar, were arrested by the security forces after the incident and curfew was imposed in the area. A day after this incident, the opposition parties walked out of the National Assembly of Pakistan in protest, and asked Asad Qaiser, the Speaker of the National Assembly, to produce Wazir and Dawar before the parliament so that they could explain their viewpoint about the incident at the parliament, but the speaker refused.
On 1 June 2019, the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mahmood Khan, announced a financial package of Rs2.5 million for the families of the people killed in the Kharqamar incident and Rs1 million to those injured in the incident. On 14 October 2020, the government withdrew the Kharqamar case against PTM, and Wazir and Dawar were acquitted of all charges.
Objectives.
The main demands of PTM presented during the Pashtun Long March's gatherings in 2018 included, among others:
Terrorism.
The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement has highly demanded that landmines must be removed from the Pashtun tribal areas. The PTM leaders have criticized Pakistan's military establishment for terrorizing lands of Pashtun people several times. They adoped a famous Balochi slogan "ye jo dehshatgardi hai, iske peeche wardi hai" (Those in uniform are behind terrorism). PTM also demanded several times that Rao Anwar and other police officers involved must be punished for the alleged murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud. PTM also demands a truth and reconciliation commission must be established for all the people who are killed extrajudicially like Naqeebullah Mehsud in alleged fake encounters by the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan The missing persons who are imprisoned at unknown places must be tried in a court of law, and forced disappearances must be stopped
Torture of Pashtuns.
PTM demands that torture and collective punishment against entire villages and tribes in the Pashtun tribal areas, especially after a violent incident, must be stopped The humiliation of locals at army checkpoints in the Pashtun areas must be ended.
Pashtun marches.
Islamabad sit-in.
On 26 January 2018, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a protest march starting from Dera Ismail Khan. Pashteen started the march along with 20 friends, but many people joined it along the way, as it passed through Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Domel, Karak, Kohat, and Darra Adam Khel, reaching Peshawar on 28 January. Then after passing through Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi, and Tarnol, the march reached Islamabad, where a sit-in called "All Pashtun National Jirga" was organized from 1 February outside the National Press Club. The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun labourer and aspiring model, Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was shot dead by police force in Karachi during an alleged encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns. It asked the government to set up a judicial inquiry for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in police encounters. The jirga demanded to stop racial profiling of the Pashtuns in Pakistan, and to bring the Pashtun missing persons before the court of law, so that those who are innocent but held could be freed. The jirga also demanded Pakistan Army to guarantee that they will not abduct or open fire on innocents in the tribal areas, or use violence or collective punishment against entire villages and tribes, and that they will not impose the frequent curfews on the movement of locals even after minor incidents. Another demand was to remove all landminess planted in the tribal areas, which have resulted in many civilian casualties. The protesters said that since 2009, more than 35 people including children had been killed due to landmines in South Waziristan alone.
The sit-in in Islamabad ended on 10 February, but the organizers of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement announced that they would reconvene the protest if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. Advisor to Prime Minister on political affairs, Engr. Amir Muqam appeared in front of the protesters with the hand-written agreement from the Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi that included three clauses, agreeing to apprehend Rao Anwar, speed-up the clearing of Mines in South Waziristan, an intermediate college establishment in name of Naqeebullah Mehsud, and promised to addressed "genuine gravencies" raised by Jirga members. Muqam also told the protestors, "the way you held the peaceful protest is really commendable and others should learn a lesson to record their protests this way. I’ll stand by you in trying times and you can come to discuss with me all of your legitimate issues anytime."
On the 13th of May, 2018 Family members of missing Pakistanis participated in a protest rally by Pashtun Tahafuz Movement in Karachi, Pakistan by holding photos of their relatives 
Public gatherings.
PTM has held public demonstrations in Bajaur, Quetta, Wanna, Peshawar, Lahore, Swat, Karachi, Dera Ismail Khan, Swabi, Bannu, Cologne, Tank, Bamyan, Miramshah, Loralai, Charsadda, Zhob, and Chaman.
Media blackouts.
The powershows and rallys of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement are not shown by mainstream media channels as they are not allowed by the Establishment, leaving social media as the primary channel for communicating with the rest of Pakistan and strengthening the narrative that the PTM is being ignored by the system.
On 23 March, the PTM meeting was scheduled to be held in Peshawar University, but Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Islam Zeb, issued an order under section 144 CrPC, imposing ban on political meetings in University and stated any violation against the order shall be preceded against u/s 188 PPC and order will be exercised "for 30 days unless modified or withdrawn." Later the meeting was held in Baghi-e-Naran, Hayatabad with 200 person attending the gathering.
The movement's anthem is "Da Sanga Azadi Da?", which means "What kind of freedom is this?". Many Pashtun's have discovered their voice with this anthem and it encloses the various grievances they have from being caught between the militants and the military.
On 26 April 2019, Mohsin Dawar tweeted that he and his fellow National Assembly member Ali Wazir were barred from holding a press conference at National Press Club (NPC) despite having prior bookings. Many prominent politicians including Pakistan Peoples Party's Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Farhatullah Babar and Bushra Gohar condemned NPC for their move. The next day, NPC issued statement claiming that the lawmakers had not made any prior bookings. The Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told the journalist Hamid Mir not to invite PTM members on media in response to a question by the journalist as to whether the media houses should invite PTM leaders on TV channels. On 29 April 2019, Asif Ghafoor said PTM would no longer be tolerated. "Their time is up," he said of PTM at the press conference.
Controversy.
Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emir Noor Wali Mehsud has expressed support for the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement. Some expert believes that TTP expressing support for the PTM and other insurgents groups in Pakistan, suggest that TTP is trying to grow its support base in Pakistan.
PTM openly criticizes the Pakistan Army and accuses the Pakistani state of violating the basic human rights of the Pashtuns, while the Pakistan Army has claimed that PTM is backed by foreign powers and their gatherings are "engineered". PTM claims that as a result, news organizations in Pakistan have been pressured to ignore PTM, and university professors have been forced to identify the students attending PTM's protest gatherings. Some Pakistani politicians and journalists also view PTM as working on a foreign or Pashtun nationalist agenda. However, PTM's leadership has claimed that they are protesting through peaceful means within the Constitution of Pakistan.
Founder of Aware Girls, Gulalai Ismail, claimed she was threatened with death by the Inter-Services Intelligence after she joined the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement and protested against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings allegedly conducted by the Pakistani state. After raising awareness of sexual assault allegedly committed by Pakistani security forces on women, Gulalai Ismail fled the country as police forces were on their way to arrest her.
Leaders of PTM including Ali Wazir and Mohsin Dawar have been criticized for making controversial remarks and using racial slurs against other ethnic groups in Pakistan. Ali Wazir has also been criticized by Pakistani media for terming Lahore and Rawalpindi as "terrorist hotspots" and demanding United States to attack them in a speech in Charsadda. Based on these remarks Information Minister of KPK , Shaukat Ali Yousafzai demanded him to be removed from National Assembly proceedings.

Woolundunga, South Australia

Woolundunga is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the western side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-east of the city of Port Augusta.
Boundaries for the part of Woolundunga within the City of Port Augusta in the west were proclaimed on 17 February 1994 while the part within the District Council of Mount Remarkable in the east was added on 13 March 1997.
The locality’s name is of Aboriginal origin and is considered by the South Australian historian, Geoffrey Manning, to be derived from the name of “springs near Mount Brown” claimed to belong to a group of Aboriginal people with “the same name.” The name was used in 1851 for a pastoral enterprise called the ‘Woolundunga Run’ which was established by J. Pat(t)erson on pastoral lease no. 32 and which was located in part of the locality due to the presence of two homestead ruins both bearing the name within the current boundaries.
Woolundunga is bounded in part by roads including the Horrocks Pass Road (B56) which passes through the pass of the same name on its southern side and the Augusta Highway which forms its western boundary.
Land use within the locality is concerned with ‘primary industry’ activities dominated by pastoralism and other classes of agriculture with land in the locality’s east being zoned to preserve “the natural and rural character and scenic features.”
Woolundunga is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government areas of the City of Port Augusta and the District Council of Mount Remarkable.

Kirstie Clements

Kirstie Clements (born 23 March 1962) is an Australian author, editor, journalist and speaker. Clements served as editor-in-chief of "Vogue Australia" for thirteen years from 1999 to 2012. She has previously acted as director and chief creative officer for luxury lingerie brand Porte-á-Vie and features editor for "Harpers Bazaar Australia".
Early life.
Clements was born on 23 March 1962 in Sydney, Australia. She grew up in the Sutherland Shire, a local government area in the southern region of Sydney, New South Wales. Clements has one older brother, Anthony. Their father died of a brain tumor when Clements was five years old.
In her youth, Clements attended Sylvania High School. She described her desire to leave her hometown at an early age, stating "Not to dismiss it, but at that point I was much more interested in the band scene. I was interested in punk, in literature, in magazines, in popular culture, and the Shire wasn’t where I was going to get that from."
At the age of sixteen, Clements moved to the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst with her mother Gloria. Describing herself as poor, Clements would often shop at disposal stores and op-shops in order to discover clothing and fashion.
Career.
First job with Vogue Australia.
At the age of 23, Clements was working in a bookstore when she saw a job being advertised in the newspaper for receptionist at Vogue Australia. Clements immediately applied for the position and was granted an interview. The last of twenty different girls to be interviewed, Clements met with a woman described as "probably in her late 60s. Glamorous; white blonde hair, blue eyes, great legs, she was gorgeous. It was about six o'clock at night and she was drinking out of a tea cup, and I’m sure it was gin… I loved her immediately and she hired me." Clements began working behind the reception desk the very next day.
Clements quickly moved on from the reception desk, taking on various jobs within the Vogue Australia offices. Describing her quick promotion, Clements stated, "I just put my hand up for everything. My key to success is to make yourself useful, just put you hand up for everything… and you’ll find what you shine at. Essentially I found I wasn’t very good at taking orders, but I was really good at giving them"
Clements departed "Vogue Australia" in the early 1990s to move to Paris and work as the foreign correspondent for "Vogue Australia", and the newly launched "Vogue Singapore". She joined the fashion show circuit, travelling constantly, and interviewing the world's top designers, beauty experts and business leaders.
"Harper's Bazaar".
Clements returned to Australia in 1997 where she briefly worked as Beauty Editor for "Vogue Australia" before joining glossy magazine rival "Harper’s Bazaar." Clements was brought on as associate editor for the magazine and worked there for just over two years from 1997 to 1999.
Return to "Vogue Australia".
Clements returned to "Vogue Australia" in 1999 to be hired as the magazine's editor-in-chief. Clements succeeded Juliet Ashworth, who was former editor-in-chief from 1998 to 1999. Clements described her return to "Vogue Australia" as a challenge to rebuild its image following a demise in the 1990s. She stated, ""Vogue" was pretty broken at that point… When I went back it took three years to build it back to what I felt was a standard that it should have been." Under Clements 'Vogue Australia' was voted Magazine of the Year 2012, had the highest readership figures in its history and had the greater market share of luxury advertising. Subscriptions also rose to a 51% ratio, and was the most visited fashion website in Australia at the time. Vogue.com.au was launched under Clements in 2000.
Early on in her career as editor-in-chief, while working on a November issue, Clements was faced with an almost empty roster of booked advertisements with mere weeks to go. With a goal of 120 pages of ads, the magazine had booked just one advertisement due to a staff error. This forced Clements to undertake a restaffing of the entire office. Commenting on her preferences for staff hires, she stated, "I liked to have a local staff, and an Australian staff. I didn't like to use freelancers that much if I could help it."
When interviewing applicants for potential positions at "Vogue Australia", Clements remarked how surprised she was by the number of young girls who expressed an obsession with a fashion label instead of an original style or desire to make things. She elaborated by stating that she was "always highly dubious because I wanted them to have a passion for art, for books, for culture, for literature, for dance, for theatre, for costume design... anything but, as a matter of fact, fashion… I didn’t want people who were obsessed with labels, and I still stand by that."
Discussing her approach to management at "Vogue Australia", Clements stated, "I learnt how to be diplomatic. I think most of my job was diplomacy. Diplomacy between staff members, diplomacy between management, diplomacy to clients, to creatives." She commented that working with creatives was more rewarding than collaborating with any other worker due to their passion and vision. "They don’t care about the bonus, they don’t really care about the wage, but they care about the product, and if you can actually equip them with the materials, and the idea, and the vision, then they really can just run on praise."
Dismissal from Vogue.
In November 2006, Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Limited (rebranded as News Corp on 1 July 2013) acquired Independent Print Media Group's FPC Magazines which included Vogue Australia. News Limited placed management of the newly acquired FPC magazines ("Notebook, Delicious, Super Food Ideas, &amp; Vogue Australia)" under its NewsLifeMedia branch.
Clements was fired from her position as editor-in-chief six years after the News Limited acquisition, on 16 May 2012. She was called into a meeting with NewsLifeMedia CEO Nicole Sheffield who directed her to collect her belongings and depart the "Vogue Australia" offices immediately without offering an explanation as to why she was being fired. Clements left the office and went to have a drink at Bondi's Icebergs bar while news of her departure was announced.
Clements was succeeded by Edwina McCann, former editor-in-chief of rival magazine "Harper’s Bazaar Australia."
Current career.
The day after her firing from "Vogue Australia," Clements received a phone call from Louise Adler of Melbourne University Press who invited her to write a book about her career. Clements soon after signed a book publishing deal with Melbourne University Press to publish an auto-biography titled "The Vogue Factor". The book was published in February 2013 and detailed Clements memoirs of her 25-year career at "Vogue Australia." The book went on to become a bestseller in a number of markets worldwide, and Clements made an appearance on US talk show "The View" which was hosted by Barbara Walters to discuss the book"." "The Vogue Factor" was released in the UK by Faber and Faber in July 2013, with a US edition following in February 2014 published by Chronicle"."
Clements described writing the book as a cathartic experience which encouraged her to look back at her time with "Vogue Australia" with fondness despite the way she was let go.
Following the release of "The Vogue Factor," Clements wrote the novel "Tongue in Chic," which was published in November 2013 by Victory Books and is described as a behind-the-scenes exposé of the fashion and luxury magazine industries. Clements also co-authored "Fashion, The First Fifty Years from The Australian Women’s Weekly," which was published by the National Library Australia in 2014.
From 2014 to 2017, Clements worked as a creative consultant and editorial ambassador for Australian department store chain Myer and contributed to its "Myer Emporium Magazine", a custom magazine owned by Bauer Media Australia. During this time, Clements also launched an independent publishing house and content production company, Imprint Agency. She currently serves as its director.
In March 2017, Clements co-launched luxury lingerie brand Porte-á-Vie with former colleague Lisa Hili. She serves as the company's director and chief creative officer.
Clements often makes public speaking appearances and contributes to a number of fashion and beauty publications such as "The New Daily." She is a board director for FARE (Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education) and an ambassador for Australian children's cancer charity Camp Quality.
Clements appeared on Australian TV show "Australia’s Next Top Model" Cycle 4 which aired from 22 April – 1 July 2008. She served as a guest judge on a panel alongside Alex Perry and Charlotte Dawson.
Personal life.
In June 1992, while Clements was working as a freelance journalist in Paris she married French-Algerian nightclub bouncer Mourad Ayat. Clements met Ayat while covering collections and moved to Paris in 1994. Following their marriage and a stint working in Paris, the couple moved back to Australia in late 1997 with their two sons.
Clements is a mother to twin sons, Sam and Joseph Ayat (born 1995). Clements and her family reside in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

<doc id="56565072" url="?curid=56565072" title="Kosovo Derby">
Kosovo Derby

The Kosovo Derby also known as Gjilan Derby or Anamorava Derby is a football rivalry between fierce rivals Drita and Gjilani. Both of the clubs are from Gjilan one of the 7 largest cities of Kosovo. The derby was started in 1995 after the split of Drita. Initially the Kosovo media did not give importance to this derby but since 2012 the media has changed opinion for the derby. The rivalry comes about as Gjilani split from Drita and thus a new club was created.
History.
For the past 20 years the match had attracted tens of thousands of partisan fans, even as Kosovo remained in political and sporting limbo following its war of independence from what is now Serbia between 1997 and 1998. Gjilan derby has added importance. In May, 2015, Kosovo was recognised by UEFA.
In 1995, the last stage of the championship of the Kosovo Superleague 1994/95, the main players of the Drita were dissatisfied with the leaders of the club, respectively with the treatment they had, so they split from Drita and created a new club in the city of Gjilan, which was originally called Gjilan '95
Until 1999, when the Kosovo War ended, this game was difficult to develop because the Serbian government did not allow Albanians to play at the stadiums.
Fans accused each other of lying about the foundations of the clubs. Intelektualët believe that SC Gjilani was founded in 1995 only after they inherited the FK Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane that was founded in 1945, Crvena Zvezda Gnjilane is accused by Intelektualët as a Serb nationalist club. While Skifterat accuse that FC Drita before had the name KF Poleti which was founded by Serbs and after a few years after many Albanians were in the club, for this reason the club changed its name to Drita. Both stories have been rejected by many officials from both clubs and citizen of the city.
Supporters.
Intelektualët.
Drita, in the 1997–98 championship was a great team wherever in Kosovo and in many sporting games, the meetings started but it was difficult to name the fans. The Ballkani and Drita match was a tough game because Ballkani fought for the survival and Drita for champion, so the fans traveled to Suva Reka for the last time without a name after this game, before the game against biggest rival Gjilani, the board succumbed and after many debates the name was assigned because most of the players except they played were also writers, poets, politicians and so on.
The Intellectuals are the biggest ultras group in Kosovo, with many transfers outside Gjilan. They also have the record of audience in football of Kosovo, the biggest was against Gjilani in 2011 with 13,000 fans and they traveled also in 2002 with 30,000 fans to the final of the Kosovar Cup in the Fadil Vokrri Stadium.
Skifterat.
"Skifterat" are the clubs ultras group. They are formed in 1999, and are the biggest rivals of Drita supporters. The name means "Falcon" in English!
Incidents.
The great rivalry among these teams has also led to hooliganism. A few days before the game is played, the tensions between the two groups increase, where there have been mass incidents between them. Even often they have conquered the pitch of stadium to face each other.

Horncastle boar's head

The Horncastle boar's head is an early seventh-century Anglo-Saxon ornament depicting a boar that probably was once part of the crest of a helmet. It was discovered in 2002 by a metal detectorist searching in the town of Horncastle, Lincolnshire. It was reported as found treasure and acquired for £15,000 by the City and County Museum, where it is on permanent display.
The fragment is long and made of silver. Its elongated head is semi-naturalistic, depicting a crouching quadruped on either side of the skull, divided by a mane along the centre. The boar's eyes are formed from garnet, and its eyebrows, skull, mouth, tusks, and snout are gilded. Its head is hollow; in the space underneath, which was filled with soil and plant matter when found, are three rivets that would have attached it to a larger object, probably a helmet. The fragment would probably have formed the crest terminal of one of the "crested helmets" used in Northern Europe during the sixth through eleventh centuries.
The boar's head terminal is one of several representations of the animal on contemporaneous helmets. Boars surmount the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, and form the ends of the eyebrows of the Sutton Hoo and perhaps York helmets. These evidence a thousand-years-long tradition in Germanic mythology associating boars with the deities, and protection. The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke the protection of a mother goddess, and in the Anglo-Saxon epic "Beowulf", the poet writes that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.
Description.
The fragment represents a boar's head. It is hollow, with a shell made of silver, parts of which are gilded, and has garnet eyes. The fragment is long, and semi-naturalistic in style. The head is elongated, capped by a prominent mane dividing the skull, and terminates in a blunt snout, defined by three grooved and gilded lines. On each side above the snout are more grooved and gilded lines representing the mouth, which includes pointed tusks. The boar's two small eyes are formed with lentoid cabochon garnets, set in beaded gold filigree work with a double collar. Two gilded eyebrows, cast in relief, are well clear of the eyes and set against the skull. This is also gilded, and repeats on either side the pattern of a crouching quadruped. The figure's head is twisted backwards, its jaws biting across its body and back foot, which, like the front foot, has three toes.
When the fragment was found it was filled with soil and plant roots. Three rivets on the underside—one near the mouth, two at the opposite end—would have served to attach it to a larger object, most likely a helmet.
Discovery.
The fragment was found on 1 May 2002 in Horncastle, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. It was discovered by a Mr D. Turner, who was searching with a metal detector. As required for found objects more than 300 years old and with more than a 10% silver content, it was reported under the Treasure Act 1996, and subsequently declared treasure. Valued at £15,000, it was purchased by the City and County Museum, Lincoln—now known as The Collection.
The acquisition was funded by the Art Fund, the MLA/V&amp;A Purchase Grant Fund, Friends of Lincoln Museum &amp; Art Gallery, and the Lincolnshire County Council Heritage Service Purchase Fund. As of 2019 the fragment is on display at The Collection alongside a variety of Anglo-Saxon grave goods.
Typology.
The boar is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and dates from the first half of the seventh century AD. Although its original purpose cannot be conclusively determined, the style and size of the boar suggests that it formed the terminal of a helmet crest. Figural terminals adorn the crests of many contemporaneous helmets, such as the Sutton Hoo helmet, which has a dragon terminal at either end, and the one from Staffordshire, which features a horse-head terminal. Boar iconography is also found on helmets from the period, typically on the crests, as with the Benty Grange, Wolaston and Guilden Morden examples, or at the ends of the eyebrows, as on those from Sutton Hoo and perhaps York. The Horncastle fragment, with its lentoid eyes, tusks, and defined mane, is stylistically similar to the boar atop the Benty Grange helmet.
Taken in context, the boar would probably have adorned an early model of the "crested helmets" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. Such helmets are characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest, from which the name of the helmet type derives and at one end of which the Horncastle boar was probably once attached.
Iconography.
The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was "venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time." Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La Tène examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish examples three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They probably represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection.
Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four legions, including the England-based twentieth, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman introduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the "Beowulf" poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

Symphony No. 12 (Glass)

Symphony No. 12 ("Lodger") is the twelfth symphony by the American composer Philip Glass. The work was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered January 10, 2019, with John Adams conducting the LA Phil at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. The European premiere followed on May 9, 2019 with a performance by the London Contemporary Orchestra at Southbank Centre.
Based on David Bowie's 1979 album "Lodger", it completes Glass's trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie's Berlin Trilogy of albums, which previously inspired Glass's first and fourth symphonies, based on "Low" and "Heroes", respectively. Glass had indicated his intent to write this third work as early as 1997, when he told the "Los Angeles Times" that he had discussed approaches to its composition with Bowie.
Reviews.
The premiere was greeted with positive reviews in the LA Times, with soloist Angélique Kidjo praised for "illuminating on every level" the lyrics of David Bowie.
The San Francisco Classical Voice was not so kind, calling the work "as overstuffed as a lumpy couch" and criticizing the choice of vocal soloist for the work.
The premiere in London at the Royal Festival Hall was positively reviewed by the Financial Times complimenting Angelique Kidjo's performance: "With a husky, Marlene Dietrich-style low end, she was a bracingly expressionist presence, reimagining Bowie’s surrealistic verses as Weimar cabaret. She rose impressively to the demanding role." Bachtrack gave a favorable review also: "Glass wrote the work with the formidable voice and presence of Kidjo in mind, and she gave a performance of deep presence and strength, her voice beginning in a purposeful, chromatic drone that followed Glass’ chromatic lines, but drawing the audience in a journey of gradual expansion and emotion as the symphony progressed. The music itself is lush and formidable, overlaid by the presence of the Royal Festival Hall’s imposing organ which acts as a forceful parent to the orchestra."
Compositional technique.
Instead of basing the symphony on Bowie's musical themes, "Symphony No. 12" is based on the lyrics of David Bowie's "Lodger" and employs a larger orchestra (including an organ) and vocal line.
The work is in seven movements:

<doc id="56565155" url="?curid=56565155" title="Project Wickenby">
Project Wickenby

Project Wickenby was a long-running joint-agency investigation initiated by the Australian Government in 2005 to combat offshore tax evasion. The investigation was jointly run by the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission.
After 76 people were charged and 46 convictions recorded, the investigation concluded on 30 June 2015.
According to the Australian Taxation Office, Project Wickenby was responsible for recouping $985.67 million.
Background.
Although Project Wickenby became public in 2005, the operation was prompted by the discovery of a laptop computer during an Australian Crime Commission raid in February 2004, when the hotel suite at the Sheraton Towers in Melbourne where Swiss accountant Philip Egglishaw was staying was searched. Egglishaw was meeting with corporate lawyer Michael Brereton, who is believed to have been the target of the raid. However, Egglishaw's seized laptop was discovered to have the details of hundreds of Australians allegedly linked to his offshore accountancy business, Strachans, based in the Channel Islands.
During Project Wickenby, numerous examples of fraudulent activities were uncovered including false invoices, sham loans, fake asset transfers, hidden share trading and sham labour hire along with various dubious ways of repatriating funds back to Australia such as holding accounts offshore to avoid audit trails.
High-profile targets.
Project Wickenby is noted for investigating several high-profile figures including actors Paul Hogan and John Cornell as well as music industry executive Glenn Wheatley.
Former cricketers Allan Border and Shane Warne were also questioned during the investigation.
Cornell and Hogan were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing and reached a "without admission" settlement with the ATO in 2012. Hogan had been previously banned from leaving Australia after attending his mother's funeral in 2010 while the ATO pursued Hogan.
However, Wheatley pleaded guilty in 2007 to three tax-related charges including a failure to declare nearly $300,000 he made from a John Farnham tour and his earnings from a 2003 Kostya Tszyu boxing match. Wheatley was sentenced to fifteen months in prison by the Victorian County Court.
Other targets.
Three company directors who were arrested in June 2005 on the Gold Coast were the first to be charged as part of the investigation. The Gold Coast businessmen were named as Adam Hargraves and two shareholders in his publishing company Phone Directories Co (PDC), his brother Glenn Hargraves and Daniel Stoten.
The three men were arrested after police raided their homes, the company's head office and the home of Adam Hargraves's accountant. Phone Directories Co Pty Ltd published telephone books in regional areas of Australia including Rockhampton and Mackay. The company is now known as Local Directories.
While Glenn Hargraves was later found not guilty, Adam Hargraves and Daniel Stoten were found guilty by a Supreme Court jury of charges of conspiring to defraud a Commonwealth entity after defrauding the tax office of $2.2 million. They were sentenced to 6½ years' jail.
However, Hargraves and Stoten's lawyers appealed both the conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals against the convictions but the two men were resentenced, this time to five years' jail replacing the original sentence of 6½ years.
Accountant Philip de Figueiredo was implicated in both the Hargraves case and the Wheatley case, and he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with Wheatley to defraud the Commonwealth to cause a loss and two similar charges connected to the Hargraves and Stoten case on the Gold Coast where it was discovered de Figueiredo had set up a network of offshore companies to inflate the business expenses of Hargraves and Stoten.
An international arrest warrant was issued for Philip Egglishaw in 2013 after it was alleged he stole $34 million from Paul Hogan's Swiss bank account. Egglishaw denied the allegation, describing the accusations as 'completely false'. While attempting to leave Switzerland in May 2017, Egglishaw triggered a red notice, which drew attention to his wanted status and was subsequently arrested by Italian authorities. He was released in July 2017 after the Australian prosecutor's office did not turn up to the hearing.

Patricia Lindop

Patricia Joyce Lindop FRCP (21 June 1930 – 1 February 2018) was British professor of radiation biology at the University of London and the organiser of at least 100 "Pugwash" meetings at which scientists met to discuss their campaign for nuclear disarmament.
Early life and family.
Patricia Lindop was born on 21 June 1930, the second child of Elliot D. Lindop and Dorothy Jones. Her father was an engineer who had worked for Shell in India and later owned his own fuel distribution business. She was educated at Malvern Girls' College in Worcestershire and it was there that she met her future husband, Gerald Paton Rivett Esdale (died 1992), who was a pupil at the neighbouring boys' college. They married in 1957 and had one son and one daughter.
Career.
Lindop was one of the first women to win a place to study medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College which had resisted accepting female students until forced to change its policy by the University of London. She received a first class degree. By 1954 she was working as a general practitioner and beginning to develop an interest in the effects of radiation on the human body. She started to work with the Polish physicist, and later Nobel Prize winner (1995), Joseph Rotblat at the University of London and they conducted experiments using thousands of mice to determine the effect of radiation on living organisms. Together they published 40 papers on the subject.
Later, Lindop became professor of radiation biology at St Bartholomew's but not before facing opposition to the appointment of a woman to the post.
Lindop organised at least 100 "Pugwash" conferences with Rotblat, who had worked on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War but became vehemently opposed to them after seeing their effects on Japan. The Pugwash movement was a group of scientists who campaigned for nuclear disarmament and Lindop often held meetings of Pugwashites, as they are known, at her home in Hampstead, London.
She was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1977 (member, 1956). She was chairman of Thames Liquid Fuels (Holdings) Limited from 1992.
Later life.
Lindop suffered a stroke at the age of 50 that restricted her movement and ability to speak, effectively ending her academic career. A more severe stroke in 1993 left her confined to a wheelchair and unable to move her mouth. She died on 1 February 2018.

The Tale of Shim Chong (film)

The Tale of Shim Chong () is a 1985 North Korean musical film directed by Shin Sang-ok.
It is based on the traditional story of the same name. The story is of Shim Chong, the daughter of a poor blind farmer. The peasant signs a deal with a monk to deliver 300 sacks of rice in return of his sight, but is unable to deliver the goods. Shim Chong agrees to be sacrificed to the God of the Sea on behalf of sailors who need to appease the deity. She is thrown into the sea and meets the god who praises her for her filial piety. Shim Chong returns to the surface inside a giant orchid that fishermen take to the king of the land. The king falls in love with her and helps her find her desperate father who has gone missing by organizing a feast for all the blind people in the kingdom.
"The Tale of Shim Chong" was made when Shin and his wife Choi Eun-hee, who plays the part of Shim Chong's mother, were abducted to North Korea. The two were allowed to complete the filming of the underwater sequences of the film at the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich, West Germany. The negatives of the film went missing for some time, before Shin re-discovered them in Pyongyang.
"The Tale of Shim Chong" has been likened with the work of Busby Berkeley.
Plot.
Shim Chong is the daughter of a poor blind farmer whose wife has died. Her father visits a temple one day and is told by a monk that his blindness could be cured in exchange for 300 sacks of rice. The farmer agrees to supply the sacks, but soon realizes that he is not able to.
Meanwhile, a group of sailors lament that they have angered the God of the Sea. The only way to appease the god is to sacrifice a young girl. Shim Chong agrees to be the sacrificial offering if the sailors provide the sacks of rice her father is missing and some money. Once the farmer finds out about this deal he unsuccessfully tries to stop Shim Chong.
Shim Chong is taken to the sea in the sailors' ship and thrown overboard. The seas immediately calm. Shim Chong sinks to the bottom of the sea and meets the God of the Sea. The god has been waiting for her to arrive in his realm and praises her for her filial piety. In the underwater world, Shim Chong also meets her deceased mother.
Shim Chong leaves the world of the God of the Sea by floating to the surface inside a giant orchid. A group of fishermen discover the orchid and take it to the king who rules the land. Shim Chong emerges from the orchid and the king falls in love with her. Shim Chong, however, can only think about her father who has gone missing. It turns out he had found a new woman, but the woman cheats her and takes all of the money that Shim Chong had asked from the sailors.
The king helps Shim Chong find her father by organizing a feast for all blind people in his kingdom. When Shim Chong recognizes her father at the feast, he miraculously regains his eyesight.
Cast.
Choi Eun-hee acts the part of Shim Chong's mother.
Themes.
The theme is of suffering and filial piety.
Production.
"The Tale of Shim Chong" was directed by Shin Sang-ok while he and his wife Choi Eun-hee were abducted to North Korea. It is in the genre of a musical film. The story is based on an ancient Korean folk tale The Tale of Shim Chong about a princess of a realm at the bottom of the sea. Shin had already made a film based in the story in 1972 in South Korea.
The underwater world is populated by dancers in exotic outfits. Although they are masked, their way of dancing gives away the fact that they are Western actors. This otherworldly realm is contrasted with the kingdom on dry land, which is inhabited by people acted by Koreans.
With the permission of Kim Jong-il, Shin and Choi traveled to the Bavaria Film Studios in Munich, West Germany, where they shot the underwater sequences of the film. Shin was helped in special effects by the team that made the film "The NeverEnding Story". Shin and Choi's every move in Munich was followed by seven North Korean bodyguards. Nevertheless, Johannes Schönherr, the author of "" raises the question why they did not try to defect in a city that was in the West, where it would have been comparatively easy at any rate. Instead, Shin and Choi returned to North Korea after the filming was complete. The film was released in 1985, the same year that he directed "Pulgasari" and saw the release of his film "Salt".
Shin sent the negatives of "The Tale of Shim Chong" to Kim Guh-wha, a Shin Film representative in Hong Kong to add Chinese subtitles. Kim was the man whom, as Shin later discovered, had handed him over to North Korean agents in Hong Kong in 1978. The negatives went missing at some point. Shin rediscovered the negatives when he visited Kim Jong-il's film archives in Pyongyang.
Critical response.
Paul Fischer, the author of "A Kim Jong-Il Production" likens it with the work of Busby Berkeley, calling it "an extravagant musical ... with fantasy creatures, expensive costumes, and underwater scenes".

General Sergei Ivanovich Mal'tsov () (1810–93) was a Russian industrialist of the nineteenth century.
His father, Ivan Akimovich Mal’tsov expanded the family business, previously based on glass and linen production by developing the metallurgy industry in Lyudinovo, Kaluga Oblast. From this basis Sergei developed the Mal’tsov industrial region an area which covered about 215,000 hectares mostly along the Bolva River. He turned the industrial region into a major centre of machine building. It was here that the first rails, locomotives, steamships, and screw propellers were made in Russia. By 1875, Mal’tsov was able to found a corporation which included over 30 enterprises with a combined capital of 6 million rubles. These works were nationalised in 1885.

Hans Joachim Meyer

Hans Joachim Meyer (born 13 October 1936) is a German politician (CDU). He served in the de Maizière cabinet as the last East German Minister for Education and the Arts. After reunification he became in the regional government of Saxony. In addition, he served between 1997 and 2009 as President of the Central Committee of German Catholics ("Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken" / ZdK).
Life.
Hans Joachim Meyer was born in Rostock. He grew up, after 1945, in the Soviet occupation zone which was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After successfully completing his school studies in Rostock he moved to the Berlin area. He attended the ("Deutsche Akademie für Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft") in Potsdam between 1955 and 1958 but was excluded after six terms before he could complete his degree because he "failed to connect with the working class" ("wegen "mangelnder Verbindung zur Arbeiterklasse""). The real issue, he later told an interviewer, was his commitment to the Catholic Church. His decision while still at school to join the CDU back in 1952, at a time when the ruling party was engaged in a robust campaign to take control of rival political parties, will already have drawn him to the attention of the authorities as a potential dissident in the making. For the next year he worked as an "assistant" at the VEB Lokomotivbau Potsdam-Babelsberg (factory) as the nearby rail-locomotive plant was known at that time. After that, resigning from the CDU in 1961, he was able to restart his university studies, now embarking on a course at the Humboldt University of Berlin of English and American Studies and Philology. His decision to select a subject that was seen by the authorities as less directly political was vindicated, in that this time he was able to complete his course, emerging with his university degree in 1964. He remained at the Humboldt as a teacher and senior research assistant between 1964 and 1982. He received his doctorate in 1971. His dissertation was, again, resolutely non-political: it comprised a semantic analysis of the modern English verb prefix "Up" when compared to related prefixes in English and German (""Semantische Analyse der modernenglischen Verbalpartikel "up" im Vergleich zu verwandten englischen und deutschen Verbalpartikeln""). Ten years later his habilitation, received in 1981, could have opened the way to a lifelong university career, had "events" not intervened. He was assigned to the Foreign Languages section between 1973 and 1977, becoming deputy director for education and training. Between 1978 and 1990 he headed up the Intensive Languages Training section at the Humboldt. He also held an appointment as Professor of Applied Linguistics between 1985 and 1990.
During his academic career in East Berlin Meyer was engaged with the church. Between 1973 and 1975 he served as a member of the Dresden Pastoral Synod of the region covered by the German Democratic Republic. Between 1976 and 1982 he worked with the Pastoral Council for the Bishopric in respect of East Berlin.
During the later 1980s the winds of Perestroika blowing cross from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance on the streets in the German Democratic Republic, (even if the government was appalled). In November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became apparent that Fraternal Forces from the east had received no orders to intervene militarily. There would be no repeat of 1953 or of the tragedy of 1968 in Prague. A seemingly unstoppable series of events now unfolded leading to the country's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free and fair election. In previous general elections, turn-pout had always been recorded at around 99% of eligible voters and the proportion of votes cast for the ruling Socialist Unity Party had always been recorded at around 99% of votes cast. However, results in March 1990 indicated significant levels of support for various political parties, with the CDU and its centre-right allies winning 48% of the votes. Shorty after that Meyer received and accepted an invitation to join the new government headed up by Lothar de Maizière, despite not being at this stage a member of any political party, and despite not having stood for election to the national parliament ("Volkskammer"). Between 12 April and 3 October 1990 Meyer served as the German Democratic Republic's last Minister for Minister for Education and the Arts. His responsibilities included participation as leader of the East German delegation at the between May and September 1990. The commission was mandated to adapt an education system that would be implemented across a unified Germany. The commission's output was summarized in the Reunification Treaty (Articles 37 &amp; 38) which came into force in October 1990 and was then implemented both at government level and on the ground.
In August 1990 the East German CDU (party) formally merged back into the West German CDU from which it had been forcibly separated by the post-war division of Germany, and Hans Joachim Meyer took the opportunity to rejoin the party from which, out of "disappointment over the party's limited political options", he had resigned in 1961. Directly following reunification he joined the regional government of Kurt Biedenkopf in Saxony, serving between November 1990 and May 2002 as .

T. K. V. Desikachar

Tirumalai Krishnamacharya Venkata Desikachar (21 June 1938 – 8 August 2016), better known as T. K. V. Desikachar, was a yoga teacher, son of the pioneer of modern yoga as exercise, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. The style that he taught was initially called Viniyoga although he later abandoned that name and asked for the methods he taught to be called "yoga" without special qualification.
Biography.
Desikachar was born in Mysore, son of the pioneer of modern yoga Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, under whom he studied. He moved to Madras (now Chennai) in the early 1960s. He had trained as an engineer, but, inspired by his father's teachings, he studied under his father in the 1960s, and from the 1970s he taught in many parts of the world. He published many books, especially the 1995 "The Heart of Yoga". During his thirty years of study, Desikachar learned the practice and application of yoga techniques and texts, for therapeutic, exercise, and spiritual purposes.
Desikachar developed Viniyoga, a term from the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. This approach is claimed to be holistic and aligned with the "Yoga Sutras".
In 1976 Desikachar and A. G. Mohan founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (KYM), a yoga therapy clinic and yoga center in Madras, India, as a non-profit public charitable trust. Under Desikachar’s leadership, it offered teacher training and individual instruction in asana, pranayama, meditation, yoga philosophy, and Vedic chanting. It conducted research into the impact of yoga on people suffering from schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, and depression. It has been recognized by the Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India. The institution is a public registered charity, identified by the Department of Family Health and Welfare of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Family.
His wife, Menaka Desikachar, taught yoga and Vedic chanting at KYM and continues to do so at Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation (KHYF), founded in 2016. Bushan Desikachar, Dr. Kausthub Desikachar and Mekhala Desikachar are his three children. Kausthub is the Chief Executive and a senior teacher and yoga therapy consultant at KHYF. Kausthub was the Executive Trustee of the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (KYM) till 2012, when he stepped down after sexual misconduct allegations.
Death.
Desikachar died on 8 August 2016 in Chennai, India at the age of 78.

Integral bridge

An integral bridge contains no expansion joints to accommodate enlargement due to increased temperature. Horizontal (axial) movements due to thermal expansion and braking loads are instead transferred to the fill adjacent to the abutment. The omission of the expansion joint removes a pathway for the penetration of chloride-bearing road salts to the bridge's sub-structure. In the United Kingdom there is a presumption that most new short to medium length bridges will be of the integral type.
An early example of an integral bridge is masonry arch bridge. Some of the earliest examples of integral bridges in reinforced concrete were constructed as part of the United Kingdom's M1 motorway in 1959.
Description.
An integral bridge contains no expansion joints, spanning monolithically from abutment to abutment. Movement due to thermal expansion and contraction or braking loads is accommodated by the end walls or abutments. Where intermediate supports are specified (e.g. bridge piers) these may also serve to resist thermal expansion movements.
The omission of the expansion joint removes a significant maintenance and durability issue, as it serves as a point of ingress for road salts which allows the abutment, piers and deck soffit concrete to come under chloride attack that can cause degradation and eventual span failure. A 1989 British study showed that the majority of expansion joints surveyed in existing bridges had failed and allowed water (and hence salt) ingress.
The movement experienced at the abutment in an integral bridge is an order of magnitude greater than those designed with movement joints. The size of movement depends on the stiffness of the bridge structure and the fill adjacent to the abutment (which is subject to compaction). The movement is largest in the upper portion of the abutment, where thermal effects are greatest. Highways England specify that integral bridges should be designed to limit movement to . Due to repeated expansion and contraction cycles the backfill adjacent to the abutment is subject to ratcheting, whereby the material's stiffness is increased. The maximum stiffness level is reached after around 100–200 thermal expansion cycles.
Types.
Highways England recognises four types of integral bridge, defined by the construction of their abutments:
Where bridge bearings are used on an integral bridge (as is often the case for end screen abutment types) the structure is sometimes referred to as semi-integral.
Use.
It is widely accepted that short to medium length bridges should be designed as integral structures to minimise maintenance requirements. Highways England's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (applicable to the whole of the UK and many parts of it, including the section on integral bridges, applying to the Republic of Ireland) states that all bridges with deck length less than and skew of less than 30 degrees should be designed as integral structures unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

Lyulya kebab

Lyulya kebab or lule kebab is a type of kebab cooked on skewers. It is made from minced meat. It is a specialty of Armenian, Azerbaijani, and other cuisines of countries in South Caucasus, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
Preparation.
The soft portion of the mutton is ground with onion using a meat grinder and mixed with pepper and salt. There should be 400 grams of onion in per 1 kilogram of minced meat. This ratio is followed, to make it stay on the skewer. The meat mash is mixed well and stored in a cold for an hour. Later the mince is extracted from the refrigerator and is mixed well. The mince is wrapped around the skewer. The mince gets slightly long form on a slightly wide skewer. Then it gets fried on coal barbecue, called a mangal. It’s cooked for 10-15 minutes. The kebab is served between the lavash. Sprinkling sumac on it is optional.

Granada Street

Granada Street, also known as Senator Jose O. Vera Street, is a road in Quezon City, Metro Manila, the Philippines. It runs from Nicanor Domingo Street as an extension of Gilmore Avenue to the boundary with San Juan, where it terminates at Bonny Serrano Avenue and becomes Ortigas Avenue.
Route description.
The land on which the street lies on used to be part of an estate owned by the family of Jose O. Vera, founder of Sampaguita Pictures and later Senator from 1946 to 1949. In the late 1950s, Mayor Norberto Amoranto convinced the Vera family to permit construction of the street through their property, part of a project to improve connectivity between Quezon City — at the time the capital of the Philippines — and the surrounding suburbs, particularly those headed to New Manila from Mandaluyong and Pasig. The family sold one hectare of land to the Quezon City government at a significant discount to facilitate construction of the road, and its completion enabled direct access to Quezon City from eastern Metro Manila without needing to go through side streets or Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. In 2004, the street was renamed after Vera by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City.
Today, Granada Street is known for being home to several "parol" (Christmas lantern) vendors which line both sides of the street, giving it the name "Parol Row". Also known as the "Parolan sa San Juan" ("Lantern Area on the San Juan"), selling lanterns here began in the 1990s, when Sampaguita Pictures crewmen made lanterns and sold them outside the studio premises to generate extra income. Several vendors sell their lanterns here from September to December every year, with some selling the rest of the year as well. The street is also a culinary destination, having held this distinction since the 1970s. Modern-day dining establishments along the street include Gavino's Donuts, known for their Japanese-style donuts, and Mien-San, known for their Chinese-style steamed brisket and other dishes.

KTM 790 Duke

The KTM 790 Duke is a naked parallel-twin motorcycle, manufactured by KTM from 2017. The Duke's liquid cooled eight-valve DOHC engine uses a 285° crankshaft in order to mimic KTM's 75° V-Twins. Its power output is 105 bhp.
The Duke is KTM's first parallel-twin bike; previously the factory had produced only singles and V-twins. Released in 2018 for the European market, KTM propose to release the Duke as a 2019 model to the US market in late 2018. Starting in 2021, this new model will be produced in China. It appears that no changes will be made to KTM's warranty, which covers the lesser of two years or twenty-four thousand miles, and guarantees the frame, swingarm, ignition system, engine parts inside the crankcase.
The Duke is also the first middleweight naked with an inertial measurement unit within its electronics that include ride-by-wire, fuel modes, and multi-level traction control. It also includes a bi-directional quickshifter. With a dry weight of 169 kg, the pared-down design is said to make the Duke the lightest bike in the middleweight naked market. KTM cooperated with Maxxis to develop special tyres for the Duke.
Reception.
The KTM Duke has received positive reviews.
In Motor Cycle News, senior bike tester Michael Neeves wrote that the KTM "manages to combine the best bits of its rivals", with "the speed and electronic sophistication of the Triumph Street Triple R, the punch and simplicity of the MT-07 and the cheekiness of the MT-09 ... with a dash of crazy 1290 Super Duke R". Neeves praises the KTM's riding position and comfort, but points out that wind protection is non-existent. His overall verdict: "Its engine is a peach, the chassis balanced and it's topped off with superbike-spec electronics".

Corrachomera

Corrachomera () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Currach-Humra.
Geography.
Corrachomera is bounded on the north by Owencam and Tullywaum townlands, on the west by Tullyveela and Tullynaconspod townlands, on the south by Cartronnagilta and Greaghnadoony townlands and on the east by Corlough townland, Leitra, Corlough and Tullytrasna townlands. Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, forestry plantations, gravel pits, dug wells and spring wells. Corrachomera is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 337 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Corrachomera was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as "Corcamderry" and lists the proprietor as "Lieutenant Arthur Newborogh" and the tenant as "John Trench", both of whom appear in other Templeport townlands in the same survey.
The 1658 Down Survey map depicts the townland as "Curcanderry" (Irish "Corcach Doire" meaning 'The Marsh of the Oakwood').
On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the lands of "Curcandry alias Curranderry" to Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, for a term of 99 years. Saunders' son Morley Saunders leased his interest in "Coracomgery" to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy by deed dated 24 December 1720. Deeds, tenant lists etc. relating to Corrachomera from 1650 onwards are available at- by searching for Derryvella.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as "Corcramgerry".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Curraghcombera or Curcanderry" and the owners as "John Finlay" and "George Finlay" and the previous owner as "Colonel Ennery deceased".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list sixty-seven tithepayers in the townland.
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The townland is bounded on the S. side by a large mountain stream".
The Corrachomera Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 138, being 62 males and 76 females. There were twenty-six houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 122, being 64 males and 58 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were twenty-two houses in the townland, two of which were uninhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists thirty eight landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 118, being 54 males and 64 females. There were twenty-two houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twenty seven families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are twenty seven families listed in the townland.

Martin Shakkum

Martin Lucianovich Shakkum (; born September 21, 1951 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, USSR) is a Russian politician, economist and psychologist. He is member of the State Duma since 1999.
Shakkum was a candidate in the 1996 Russian presidential election.
Biography.
Early life.
Born on 21 September 1951 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast. Studied at school No.7 of Krasnogorsk. Graduated from Kaliningrad Higher Military Engineering College, then All-Union Correspondence Civil Engineering Institute. For three years he worked as an employee of the laboratory of the Space Research Institute in Moscow.
From 1978 to 1991 he worked as a service–engineer, chief engineer, deputy chief and then chief of special works of the Main Department for Construction in the Moscow Oblast.
From 1991 to 1999 Shakkum was CEO, Vice President and then President of the International Fund for Economic and Social Reforms ("Reforma" Fund). This Fund was created by Martin Shakkum together with academicians-economists Stanislav Shatalin, Leonid Abalkin, political scientist Andranik Migranyan and other prominent scientists and public figures.
Presidential campaign.
Shakkum ran for President as independent candidate in the 1996 Russian presidential election.
An associate of radical economist Shatalin, Shakkum was on the right wing of the Russian political spectrum. While he presented an authoritarian personality, he held moderate positions on many social issues.
To protect the rights and liberties of citizens against government corruption and abuses of power, Shakkum proposed forming a chain of executive power, excluding the possibility of concentration of various forms of power in the hands of individual central and regional elites. Specifically, he proposed forming 19 federal administrative districts across Russia, creating a system of separate federal executive bodies.
He also proposed requiring all civil servants of federal and regional government bodies and deputies of elective bodies to publish their income reports and documentation of all property belonging to them and their immediate relatives, including adult children, both in Russia and abroad.
To address the nation's economic woes, Shakkum proposed, "establishing a reliable system of control over cash flows and strengthening the country's banking system by reorganizing it and creating special investment banks."
At the same time, however, Shakkum supported the existence natural resource monopolies, such as Gazprom, and warned against attempts to split them into smaller entities.
Shakkum's original registration had been rejected by the Central Election Commission on account of lacking a sufficient number of signatures. However, Shakkum successfully managed to appeal through the Supreme Court.
In April 1996, he created the Socialist People's Party and became its leader.
Shakkum received 277,068 votes in the first round (0.4% of the overall vote).
Subsequent career.
In 1998, Shakkum survived an assassination attempt. On 8 September, around 9 PM, near his house, his car was shot from the machine gun. Shakkum has not suffered, the employee of Fund "Reform" Valery Basok, who was with him in the car, received a slight injury. Commenting on the attack, Shakkum stated that he could not link the incident to his personal and public life.
In December 1999, Shakkum was elected to the State Duma for the Istra single-member constituency. He was supported by the electoral bloc Fatherland — All Russia.

Frank Lugard Brayne

Frank Lugard Brayne (6 January 1882 – 3 April 1952) was an administrator in the Indian Civil Service (ICS) during the British Raj era. A nephew of Lord Lugard, who was zealous in his attempts to improve what he considered to be a "backward" Africa (to fight against slavery and human sacrifice), Brayne had a similar evangelical outlook and was considered to be a maverick in the ICS. He attracted the opprobrium of both his colleagues and Indian people themselves in his attempts to improve the life of villagers in the Punjab Province of India.
Life.
Frank Lugard Brayne was born on 6 January 1882. A son of the Reverend R. T. W. Brayne, he attended Monkton Combe School before being admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he held a scholarship.
Brayne passed the competitive examination for appointment to the ICS in 1905. He was sent to the Punjab, where he worked for some time as secretary to Delhi Municipality during the period when the planning of New Delhi was underway. During World War I, he served with the 18th Lancers of the British Indian Army, being mostly based in the Middle East. He was appointed a Temporary Lieutenant in June 1915, and the Kingdom of Serbia awarded him the Order of St. Sava, fifth class, in 1917.
He was awarded the Military Cross in 1919 while serving as a Temporary Lieutenant in Egypt. The citation for that award was: 
After the war, Brayne returned to the Punjab and in 1920 he married Iris Goodeve, a daughter of Edgar Goble. He became district officer of Gurgaon, some from Delhi, at a time when the area, comprising a population of around 700,000, was suffering greatly from a recent influenza epidemic, a failed monsoon and the return of soldiers from the war. To counter the deprivation, Brayne initiated what became known as the Gurgaon Scheme, in which he hoped to alleviate the plight of peasants in all its aspects by encouraging and facilitating the idea of self-help. He wrote several books about this, including "Village Uplift in India", "Socrates in an Indian Village", "Socrates Persists in India", and "Socrates at School", as well as one comparing rural life in India with that of England. The scheme was not a success.
Clive Dewey argued, in his book "Anglo-Indian Attitudes: The Mind of the Indian Civil Service", that Brayne's approach to rural uplift was bound to fail, because Indian peasants did not share Brayne's evangelical values – not least his belief that poverty-stricken cultivators in famine-stricken areas could revolutionise their standard of living by working harder and practising thrift, without any assistance from the state. His conclusions, which were supported by years of research in Indian archives and by extensive interviews with Brayne's contemporaries, were accepted by several members of the ICS and have been endorsed by subsequent historians. Philip Mason, himself a former member of the ICS, and the author of the most famous history of the service, described Brayne as being More recently, Atiyab Sultan said that Brayne's interventionism had a "missionary zeal" and that his methods were "more prescriptive" than those of Malcolm Lyall Darling, who was another somewhat maverick British administrator in Punjab.
One of Brayne's sons, Thomas Lugard Brayne, became embroiled in a controversy in "The Times Literary Supplement" and the "Telegraph" following the publication of Dewey's book in 1993. He believed that Dewey had seriously misrepresented his father, unreasonably portrayed the character of the ICS itself, and misled the Brayne family, whose collection of private papers he used. In his rejoinders, Dewey pointed out that when he asked for permission to use Brayne's papers, he believed that Brayne's Gurgaon Experiment had been a success, because he only had Brayne's vainglorious accounts of his own achievements to go on; and he only lost confidence in Brayne's form of "rural reconstruction" after the overwhelming mass of evidence showed how dismally it had failed. It was impossible, he maintained, to take Brayne at his own valuation. Brayne boasted that he could 'do anything with propaganda' – and propaganda is what his work remained. At best, it raised the official awareness of the problems of the peasantry, without providing effective solutions.
By 1937, Brayne was Commissioner for Rural Reconstruction in the Punjab and in 1940 he was Financial Commissioner (Development) there. In December 1941, he was appointed as a 2nd Lieutenant, having retired from the ICS to become welfare officer and then Commissioner for Resettlement of Soldiers in Punjab.
Brayne returned to England prior to Indian independence. He settled at The Glebe, a farm in Ashill, Norfolk, where he attempted to apply his theories of agriculture to an area of . He died on 3 April 1952 at The Glebe, at which time his military rank was stated as being Colonel. He was survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters.
Awards.
Aside from being awarded the Military Cross, Brayne was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1941, having been made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1937. He also held the Volunteer Decoration. His wife, Iris Goodeve Brayne, had been awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal in 1928.

River Ledge Historic District

The River Ledge Historic District is a primarily residential historic district located along Jefferson, Scott, and Lincoln Streets between Franklin and Maple Streets in Grand Ledge, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
History.
The Grand Ledge area was first settled in the 1840s. In 1849, a dam and sawmill were constructed across the Grand River at the site, and in 1850 the first commercial establishment in the town opened. In 1853, the first portion of the new settlement was platted; by 1860 about 225 people lived in Grand Ledge. It was about this time that development in the River Ledge Historic District began, as Jefferson became one of the most prestigious streets to live on. In 1869, the Ionia and Lansing Railroad was constructed through Grand Ledge, bringing a trade catering to visitors, as well as a new manufacturing base, to Grand Ledge. Along with the new prosperity came accelerated development in the district, as well-to-do local businessmen and manufacturers began constructing houses.
Some of the earliest residents of the district include Edmund Lamson, the founder of Grand Ledge and the first village president; Frank D. Fitzgerald, Governor of Michigan from 1936 to 1939; Edward A. Turnbull, owner of the Grand Ledge Chair Company; hardware dealers Hillard J. Babcock and Sylvester B. Granger; grocer George Coryell; building contractor Elmer Edwards; and doctors Abraham DeGroff and Andrew G. Stanka.
Gtowth in the district continued to accelerate through the nineteenth century, with the period of most growth occurring between about 1895 and 1920. Development began to slow then, with the last historically significant structure in the district, the public library, constructed in 1931.
Description.
The River Ledge Historic District contains 282 buildings, of which 235 contribute to the historic nature of the district. All but eight of the buildings were constructed as housing, and nearly all of the houses are single family residences. The structures in the district date from the 1850s to the 1920s, and include a broad range of architectural styles, including Greek Revival and Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Bungalow/craftsman. The district contains the hares of many prominent citizens of early Grand Ledge, as well as several historic civic and church buildings.
Some of the significant structures in the district include:

Bishopsgate House is a large house in Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, England. Its 42-acre estate lies close to one of the entrances to Windsor Great Park. It was built immediately to the south of the old Bishops Gate House that was demolished in the twentieth century.
History.
In 1863, Bishops Gate House was home to Charles Joyce, a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, and in 1872, a four and a half year lease (then renewable yearly) was granted to Richard James Ashton.
During the Second World War, the house was the headquarters of 4 Wireless Group of the Royal Corps of Signals, who occupied a number of large country houses in the Egham area.
Bishopsgate House was built in the later twentieth century and is "one of several British homes" of the Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali and his second wife Christina Estrada, until his death in July 2016, who acquired it from his parents in about 2001. There were "three butlers, six gardeners, five maids, two laundry girls, two drivers, two personal assistants, two nannies and an estate manager on the staff". Juffali's art collection, estimated at £4 million, which includes art installations and sculpture in the garden and fittings from the house, will be auctioned onsite by Bonham's on 26 March 2018.

The Life of Sir William Petty, 1623–1687

The Life of Sir William Petty 1623-1687 is a book, written by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, and published in 1895. It is a biography of Sir William Petty, the 17th-century scientist, known for his inventions, his charting of large parts of Ireland, in the Down Survey, and his publications on many different topics, like "political arithmetic" and political economy.
Bibliographical information.
335 p.
Fitzmaurice founded his biography of Sir William Petty largely on the manuscripts in the so-called 'Bowood' papers. The papers originally belonging to Sir William Petty passed to his grandson, John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne (1706-1761), who bought Bowood House in Wiltshire, England in 1754.
The letters written by Sir William Petty to Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) were later added to the Bowood papers by the 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne.
Apart from the Bowood papers, Fitzmaurice also studied manuscripts in the British Museum, in the Bodleian Library and in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin.
The biographer: Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice.
Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (1846-1935), also named Edmond George Petty-Fitzmaurice, was a descendant of William Petty and a liberal politician. He also published a biography of his great-grandfather, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne in 1912, biographies of Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville (in 1905) and of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (in 1901), and some theatre plays.
The biography.
The biography is chronological. In the first chapter the life of Petty up to 1652 is summarized. It ends with his application as surgery-general in Cromwell's Irish army.
In the second and third chapter, which cover a total of 80 pages, an extensive description is given of the Down Survey, the cadastral survey carried out by Petty in 1655 and 1656, and especially on the long aftermath of that survey. After the survey Petty was accused of fraud and bribery, and it took him years to clear his name.
The next chapters cover the period from 1660 to 1678, in which Petty published much of the works that, centuries later, brought him fame among economists and statisticians. A separate, central chapter (Chapter 7) is devoted to his "Political Arithmetic" (and his opinions concerning political economy).
The last three chapters give an overview of the period from 1678 until Petty's death in 1687.
Critical reception.
The "Life of Petty" was reviewed in different journals.
 wrote a review in Die Neue Zeit, 1896.
He was happy to see that a biography on William Petty had appeared: 'Finally, more than two hundred years after his death, the most genial of the English political economists of the seventeenth century has found his biographer', writes Cunow in his review in Die Neue Zeit in 1896. But, does he write subsequently, the (large amount of) work that is done by Fitzmaurice, does not provide a satisfactory result and does not offer a clear image of the character (of Petty). Questions like 'what where the influences that worked on Petty's intellectual development?' are not answered and only on very few places insight is given into the depth of Petty's ideas ('Ideenwelt'). Neither gives Fitzmaurice an account of the less attractive sides of Petty's character, like his ruthless addiction to profitmaking.
Cunow also makes some remarks concerning Bevan's "" (1894).
 wrote a review in "The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science" of 1896, together with a review of .
Hull finds a sharp distinction between the first six chapters (1623-1678) and the last chapters. In the first chapters Fitzmaurice "writes chiefly from sources already well known (…). . Relatively little that is new appears." Whereas the latter part of the book is largely based on (until then less known) Petty's correspondence with Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) and on several unprinted letters to Lady Petty.
 wrote a review in The American Historical Review, 1895. He thought that a reader will profit of this book, full of information, and giving abundant means of arriving at a fair estimate of Petty's character, "only in proportion to what he already knows of the period; and even those who have some tolerable acquaintance with the time will find themselves at a loss to explain many of the allusions with which Petty's papers are bestrewn.

Arcs of Descent and Ascent

The Arcs of Descent and Ascent (), an ontological circle, are described in Neoplatonism, as well as in Islamic and Sufi cosmology, mainly inspired by the works of Ibn al-Arabi. In the Arc of Descent ("qaws al-nuzuli"), from unity to diversity, God creates successively the Intellect (Supreme Pen), the Universal Soul (Guarded Tablet), Prime Matter, Nature, the Universal Body (including the imaginal world) and the Earth. The Arc of Ascent ("qaws al-su'ud") is the way back to the Presence of God, the process of spiritual perfection.
In a hadith attributed to Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shi'i Islam, the arc of descent is described as having seven stages. These stages have been commented on in Shaykhism.
In Bábism and the Baháʼí Faith.
In the Bábí and Baháʼí Faiths the seven stages of the Arc of Descent are described as follows: Will (Mashiyyat), Determination (Iradih), Destiny (Qadar), Decree (Qada), Permission (Idhn), Term (Ajal), and Book (Kitab). In "Some Answered Questions" 'Abdu'l-Bahá states that "man is in the ultimate degree of materiality and the beginning of spirituality; that is, he is at the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the furthermost degree of darkness and the beginning of the light. That is why the station of man is said to be the end of night and the beginning of day." 
The Báb explained that the obligatory prayer symbolizes a spiritual journey from the realm of the body to the realm of the heart, which can be described as an arc of ascent, mirroring the arc of descent from God to creation. "The Seven Valleys" of Bahá'u'lláh is another example of the arc of ascent. It describes the valley of search, the valley of love, the valley of knowledge, the valley of unity, the valley of contentment, the valley of wonderment, and the valley of true poverty and absolute nothingness. 'Abdu'l-Bahá describes the following: The depraved soul, the self-accusing soul, the inspired soul, the assured soul, the contented soul, the accepted soul, the perfect soul, the soul of the Kingdom of God (malakút), the soul of the Dominion (jabarút) and the Divine Soul (lahút).

James Turnbull Thomson

James Turnbull Thomson (1810 – c. 20 August 1876) was a publican and brewer, recognised as the founder of Balhannah, South Australia.
History.
Thomson was a son of Rev. James Thomson, pastor of Steeple Church, Dundee, and his wife Hannah Thomson, née Turnbull.
He emigrated to South Australia aboard "Georgiana", arriving in Adelaide in August 1839. Before leaving Scotland he purchased Section 4208 in the Mount Barker region.
Another reference has him purchasing the land from Hampden Dutton after arriving in the colony.
In 1840 Thomson was involved with Robert Cock and J. L. Crabb in a venture to sell lots of land in Balhannah, which Thomson named for his mother (and also his sister) Hannah, the prefix Bal being a Gaelic word meaning "place" or "town", as in Balnagowan and Balmoral. He built the Balhannah Inn, which he let to one S. Bartlett who left shortly after.
A year later he reopened the Inn, with himself as publican,
followed by James Anderson. In 1855 Thomson's application for a licence was refused, while Edward Morris's application for the Golden Cross Hotel (now the Balhannah Hotel) was granted, sparking a feud which culminated in Thomson's serving time in jail for slander.
He brewed his first beer at Balhannah in August 1843 with the assistance of W. Milne and W. Johnston, one of the brothers who later founded the Oakbank Brewery. In June 1844 he was obliged to mortgage his property and in 1855 had a second attempt at beer brewing.
He was several times in financial difficulties, on one occasion helped out by his father, who purchased his property, then mortgaged it to pay a debt to Alexander Cock.
His body was found in marsh land near the North Arm Road, Dry Creek. He never married and appeared to have no relations in South Australia, though one John Thomson (1794–1869), later of "Lilybank", Mount Pleasant, and family are known to have stayed in the Balhannah region during their first years in the colony.

William Aikenhead

William Aikenhead (7 May 1842 – 3 April 1902) was an Australian politician, who was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1898 until his death in office in 1902.
Aikenhead was born in Launceston. His father, James Aikenhead, was the founder, editor and proprietor of "The Examiner" newspaper, and later became a politician on the Tasmanian Legislative Council. In 1869, James Aikenhead transferred his editorship of "The Examiner" to his son, where he worked for ten years.
On 21 June 1898, Aikenhead stood as a candidate in a by-election for the electoral district of Devonport. He was elected, however one of the other candidates, John McCall, petitioned the Supreme Court of Tasmania that Aikenhead had engaged in bribery and "treating by agent"—Aikenhead's representative, Archibald Phillips, had promised electors a "go in" if he was elected, and the night after the election plied local hotels with free beer paid for by Aikenhead. The court found against Aikenhead, and declared his election void, although they did not declare McCall elected, and instead called another by-election. Aikenhead was disqualified from running for Devonport for two years, however when the member for Latrobe, Henry Murray, resigned to contest the Devonport by-election, Aikenhead nominated for the Latrobe vacancy and was elected.
Aikenhead was re-elected in the March 1900 general election, and continued to serve until his death in office on 3 April 1902. He was succeeded by Murray, who had been defeated in 1900, and returned to his old seat when elected unopposed in the by-election triggered by Aikenhead's death.

S-Net

S-Net is a worldwide inter-satellite communications network consisting of four satellites and being operated by the Technical University of Berlin.
Description.
The project has the goal to investigate and demonstrate inter-satellite communication technology within a distributed and autonomously operating nanosatellite network. All satellites are equipped with a S-Band radio emitter and receiver, which not only enables communication with the ground-based control center but also allows for communication between the individual satellites. The number of satellites in the network was set to four as this number represents the best cost-benefit-ratio. With four satellites, a total of six independent communication links are possible, while only three are possible with three satellites. Moreover, four is the lowest number that enables multi-hop communication.
The satellites are powered by solar cells and batteries and have a planned lifetime of one year. 
Future applications of the technology may be more effective monitoring of global issues like climate change, disaster management, maritime systems monitoring and even enable satellite constellations for high-bandwidth internet access.
Launch.
The four satellites were successfully launched on a Soyuz-2.1A rocket from Vostochny Site 1S in Russia on 1 February 2018. The launch was originally scheduled for 22 December 2017, however due to the failure of a Soyuz-2.1B rocket, Roscosmos decided to delay the mission. The spacecraft were released into orbit at an altitude of approximately 580 kilometers at an interval of 10 seconds. The launch represents the tenth mission of the TU Berlin, sending a total of 16 satellites to space.

Ignazio Florio Jr.

Ignazio Florio Jr. (Palermo, 1 September 1869 – Palermo, 19 September 1957) was an Italian entrepreneur, heir of the rich Florio economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.
Biography.
He was the son of the Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Ignazio Florio Sr. and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. When his father died in 1891, Ignazio Jr., at the age of 22, inherited one of the greatest fortunes in Italy. The Florio business empire had far-reaching interests in sulphur, tuna fishing, Marsala wine, insurance and banking, and metallurgy (the "Oretea" foundry) and engineering. The Florio family was a major share holder in the "Navigazione Generale Italiana" (NGI), Italy's main shipping company at the time and one of the major one's in Europe.
In 1893, like his father before him, he married a woman from the old Sicilian aristocracy, Francesca Paola Jacona della Motta dei baroni di San Giuliano, who would become known as the "Queen of Palermo", as she became a prominent protagonist of the Belle Époque in Palermo. He was the principal impresario of the Teatro Massimo, when the building was finished in 1897. He was also the main shareholder and financier of the Sicilian daily newspaper "L'Ora", founded in 1900 and published in Palermo.
In the heyday of its existence reportedly some 16,000 people depended on the Florio business empire, and the press sometimes referred to Palermo as 'Floriopolis'. However, as international competition increased and the economic importance was moving to the north of Italy, to the cities of Milan, Turin and Genoa, the family had to face an increasingly deteriorated economic reality resulting in bankruptcies and closures of activity. In 1897 he had founded the "Cantiere navale di Palermo" (Palermo Shipyard) to service the commercial fleet. Construction was protracted, however, and Florio was forced to sell his stake in the shipyard to Attilio Odero in 1905. He was also forced to sell the family's interests in NGI in 1908. The blockage of maritime and commercial activities caused by the First World War paralyzed the activities of the Florios.
The Florio empire began to fade. The shipping lines depended mainly on state subsidies; the beneficial effects of the Unification of Italy had disappeared and the size of the economic empire had made it increasingly difficult to be directly manage by Ignazio, without the interference of the banks and competitors in the north. The stagnation of the family businesses, despite the awareness of the imminent decline, resulted in huge debts and all the Florio companies either were sold or disappeared. Contrary to what the founder Vincenzo Florio Sr. had done in the first half of the nineteenth century, the later generations did not sufficiently diversify their interests in new markets and did not invest in the new technologies available at the beginning of the twentieth century. They were simply trying to maintain the already acquired market positions, without opening new and more profitable ones.
Despite the increasing economic difficulties, the Florios maintained their expensive way of life. After the sale of Villa Florio all'Olvuzza in 1924, the family moved to Rome. Between 1925 and 1935 the economic collapse deprived Ignazio Junior of all his assets. In 1935 Donna Franca's jewels and their furniture and real estate were auctioned in Palermo. In spite of everything, the Florios never failed: Ignazio Florio jr did not escape his responsibilities, he sold all the companies and the whole family patrimony to pay his debts to the last penny, before retiring to private life. The last years of his life were marked by total apathy, deafness and complete loneliness except for the presence of his wife. After the death of the latter in 1950, he returned to Palermo where he died on 19 September 1957.
Issue.
Ignazio Jr. and his wife Franca had five children:

Alfredo Cremonesi

Alfredo Cremonesi (15 May 19027 February 1953) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and member from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions. He studied in Crema and Milan before setting off from Genoa to Naples and then to the Burmese missions via boat. He pledged that he would never return to the Italian mainland and spent the remainder of his life working with the Burmese people in mountain villages despite the great difficulties he faced. Cremonesi was also a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II after the Japanese occupied the nation.
The Burmese independence reached in 1948 prompted guerrilla conflict which caused great unrest and destruction to the point that Cremonesi and other missionaries were forced into exile so as to remain safe. But he reached out to the guerillas and received their permission to return to the village he worked in. It was also there in that village that government forces mistook him for a rebel - or a supporter of the rebels - and shot him dead alongside the village chief and two girls.
The beatification process for the late priest opened in 2004 and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis approved his beatification and it took place in Crema on 19 October 2019.
Life.
Childhood and education.
Alfredo Cremonesi was born on 15 May 1902 in Ripalta Guerina in Cremona as the first of seven children to the grocer Enrico Cremonesi and Maria Rosa Scartabellati. His siblings (in order) were:
He received his baptism on 16 May in the local parish church from Angelo Bassi. One cousin was Amina Uselli and a paternal aunt was the nun Sister Gemma (16 July 1878−3 April 1958). Cremonesi received his Confirmation on 4 October 1908 from the Bishop of Crema Ernesto Fontana and then made his First Communion on 1 April 1909. His father was a devoted Christian who opposed Fascism and it was his mother who oversaw the religious education of the seven children. It was in his childhood at some stage that he read the journal of Thérèse of Lisieux and from that point fostered a deep devotion to her. His brother Ernesto was also a devoted Christian whom the Nazis arrested and jailed in a concentration camp where he would die in 1945 before the European Theatre conflict ended. Cremonesi sent a letter to his parents upon learning this and said that "I am proud to be his brother" and that "Ernesto will be able to do more in paradise than he could have done on earth".
His time in school was interrupted due to a severe disease and he was forced to spend most of that time confined to his bed. His frail health since childhood led to people concluding that he would never be able to enter the missions since it would be improbable that he would be cured of his consistent ailments. The desire to enter the missions had been a dream he had for sometime since his late childhood and into his adolescence. But he defied the odds (and the expectation of doctors who thought he would die in a few months) and overcame his disease with Cremonesi attributing his healing to Thérèse of Lisieux. Upon his recuperation he transferred to Milan for education in an institute that the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions managed to prepare new missionaries on 17 September 1922. He became known for being both impetuous and a gifted writer who published a collection of poems.
Ordination and departure.
Between October and November 1923 he received the minor orders before being elevated into the subdiaconate on 19 April 1924 and the diaconate on 29 June 1924. The seminarian received his ordination to the priesthood in October 1924 (from the P.I.M.E. bishop Giovanni Menicatti in the San Francesco Saverio church) and then in June 1925 learned that his dream to enter the missions was to take place for he would be sent to the then-Burma. Cremonesi received a special dispensation for his ordination since he had not reached the canonical age required for ordination. Cremonesi celebrated his first Mass on 19 October 1924 in San Michele and on 5 October 1925 received the cross of the missions from the Archbishop of Milan Eugenio Tosi. But before being sent to the missions he was put in charge of teaching the Italian language in the Seminario Minore di San Ilario in Nervi in Genoa. He left Genoa for Naples and set sail from there on 16 October 1925 but before leaving declared he would never return to his homeland despite the insistence of his relatives to return for a visit. His mother did not take well to his desire for the missions but relented to her son's wishes and maintained correspondence with him on a frequent basis. Cremonesi celebrated his last Mass before leaving in Crema in the Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie on 4 October 1925.
Apostolate.
But his new mission also proved difficult for the enthusiastic Cremonesi who suffered from loneliness for a brief time upon his arrival on 10 November 1925. He worked with the Karen people in an isolated mountain village and often had to travel miles between communities to visit the people. His first assignment was in Yedashé in western Yoma to visit villages and he was successful in the conversion of some of the natives. He was later transferred to Donokù and would remain there until the outbreak of World War II in relative peace. Cremonesi was often exhausted from his extensive trips and he even once contracted malaria. During the 1920s he maintained correspondence with the P.I.M.E. superior Paolo Manna and met with Manna when he visited the Burmese missions on 19 February 1928.
The outbreak of World War II saw the British-run Burma enter the conflict to the detriment of Italian missionaries who soon found themselves as enemies due to Benito Mussolini declaring his alliance with the Axis powers. To that end he was moved further north to Moshò to work in the villages. Near the end of the war he was forced to live in the forest where he ate herbs in order to survive. Cremonesi wrote of the trials he endured during the war in a letter dated on 20 February 1946; he refers to his lack of food and clothing (limited to what he had on) and noting that villages were devoid of people with marketplaces being abandoned.
In 1941 he avoided Japanese imprisonment in a concentration camp in India after the Japanese occupied the nation. He lived eating herbs cooked in salt and water during this time but was discovered and caught. In the final month of the war a Japanese officer took him and tied him up for the night before allowing him to leave in the morning where he took refuge in the woods. Cremonesi did not understand the reason for his release but attributed it to the intercession of God.
Cremonesi fostered a great devotion to Thérèse of Lisieux and to the Sacred Heart. He practiced Eucharistic Adoration each night for one hour before the tabernacle and awoke around 4:00am to celebrate Mass.
He returned to Donokù after the war had ended to resume his work. But Burmese independence from the British Empire in 1948 prompted conflict once the Karen people rebelled and started to resort to use guerilla tactics against the new government. This conflict would endure even after Cremonesi's later murder. In August 1950 the rebels attacked the village prompting both Cremonesi and the inhabitants to flee into the forest before he took refuge close o the mission in Taungngu. Cremonesi was saddened that these occurrences had taken place and he referred to his current state as an exile. On 25 March 1952 he was permitted to return to the village where he was able to resume his work after he made contact with the guerillas who allowed him to return to the village. Cremonesi knew of Clemente Vismara and wrote of him in high esteem.
Murder.
The rebels defeated government soldiers - on 7 February 1953 - which prompted the surviving government forces to flee to the village that Cremonesi was stationed in. But the soldiers soon became convinced upon their entrance that the villagers favored the rebels and were perhaps allies to the rebels. This presented a clear danger to the villagers which prompted Cremonesi to intervene to assure them that there were no rebels nor rebel allies present in the village. This convinced the soldiers who left the village in peace. But the rebels ambushed the soldiers just outside the village which prompted the soldiers to return in anger to seek out Cremonesi believing it had been a set up. The soldiers even perceived his clothing to be alike to that of the rebels. Cremonesi's words went ignored and the soldiers fired their machine guns at him and the village chief who both collapsed to the ground (the village chief died while Cremonesi was still alive after being shot in the chest). Two girls were behind them and were killed in that attack. The villagers fled into the forest during the commotion while the soldiers entered the local church and desecrated it before setting the village ablaze. Once this was done the commander approached the injured Cremonesi and shot him in the face at point-blank range when he realized the priest was still alive.
The villagers returned to the remains of their village on 8 February to collect and inter the dead which included Cremonesi (while also washing his remains). But the villagers - before his burial - cut some parts of his beard and bloodied shirt and sent it to P.I.M.E. authorities in Taungngu in an envelope with an inscription: "Relics of the martyr Father Cremonesi to be sent to his parents". On 7 May 1953 a P.I.M.E. priest visited Donokù for the identification of his remains which were exhumed for a solemn funeral and burial in Taungngu. His death was announced in Crema in the diocesan paper "Il nuovo Torrazzo" on 14 February 1953 in a piece entitled "Abbiamo un martire".
Beatification.
The beatification process opened on 29 March 2004 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled the late priest as a Servant of God and issued an edict that declared "nihil obstat" (no objections to the cause). The general forum for the process (the investigation) was transferred on 4 March 2004 from Taungngu to the Cremona diocese but it was also conducted in the Taunggyi archdiocese. The diocesan process of investigation was opened in 2004 and concluded on 9 June 2004 in the two dioceses with their respective heads (Bishop Dante Lafranconi and Matthias U Shwe) overseeing the process. The C.C.S. issued a decree on 9 February 2007 that made the diocesan investigation valid while historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved Cremonesi's cause on 13 May 2014 after assessing the historical context in which he died.
The postulation drafted and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2015 for evaluation while nine theologians confirmed the cause in their meeting held on 6 February 2018. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members met and approved the cause on 5 March 2019. Pope Francis approved the cause on 19 March 2019 which allowed for Cremonesi to be beatified; it was celebrated on 19 October 2019 in Crema with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding over the celebration on the pope's behalf.
It has been confirmed from some officials close to the cause in Cremona that the beatification - if and when approved - would be celebrated in Cremona. It was later elaborated on that there were high hopes that Cremonesi could be beatified in October 2019 when the cause received papal approval.
The current postulator for this cause is Francesca Consolini.

Ghosts of Sayala

Ghosts of Sayala (, translit. "Afaryt el-Sayala") is a 2004 Egyptian TV series directed by Ismail Abd al-Hafez and written by drama writer Osama Anwar Okasha, the last one he wrote before he died. The show stars 23-year old Ahmed El-Fishawy, Abla Kamel, Hassan Hosny, Zeina, Mahmoud El-Hadini, Safia El Emari and others. It was aired for 37 episodes in one season produced and aired by EMPC.
Production.
The opening song was performed by Hani Al-Abd.
In a 2018 interview, Ahmed El-Fishawy stated that his role in the show still his favorite role of his acting career.
The show had some problems during production and also with advertisers, which led to exclude it from the Ramadan season.
Synopsis.
The story follows numerous simple people from the same poor and rural region of Sayala which is located in Bahary, Alexandria. Contrastingly, there is a completely different classy element; an old billionaire and his family based in Cairo. The old man learns that he has a son from a third wife from Sayala, which made him feel utterly ashamed of himself. As result, he decides to write his will giving his newly known son the big share of his money and assets, an action that made his family so distressed, as they don't even know they have another sibling from another wife, moreover, he comes from a much lower social class. And then, the events get more complicated when it's time to execute the will.
After getting the money, Maghaouri's life changes slowly into a luxurious style, also his family. On the other hand, Qesmat Hanem and her family couldn't bear the unexpected distribution of money and assets, and the suspicious appearance of Maghaouri, so they start battles legally and through other ways.
The first scene of the series is somehow an overall conception of the events and also the moral philosophy of the story, the scene set in a local cafe in Sayala, and then starts the monologue-wise conversation between an old man (A'am Asaliya) and a falsely claimed reporter, the old man spoke frankly and modestly about his long stay in the urban area, his views on the people and how poverty sometimes might create cooperative little communities and more strong beliefs and ethics, though, the evil always come from many ways. There are many scenes in almost every episode in the show which we can find portraits of these thoughts or even through a blunt dramatic dialogue.

Utsira High

Utsira High is a basement high and horst in the southwest of the Norwegian continental shelf. It lies east of the Viking Graben and west of the Stord and Egersund basins 190 km west of Stavanger. It was on the Balder oil field at the flank of the Utsira High that oil was first discovered in Norway in 1967.
The basement is of Utsira High is composed of granite that formed in Ordovician times. Parts of these granites contain saprolite and saprock that formed from weathering above sea level during the Early Mesozoic. before they became buried in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous-aged sandstone. These weathered rocks may be unconventional petroleum reservoirs.
The strandflat at Bømlo island is considered a sedimentary rock-free equivalent to the Utsira High.

Early life and career.
He was born in Naples in 1929: the son of a glass craftsman, he had lost his mother in 1941 and had done a little bit of everything, even the kitchen boy and the porter, to help run the family. He first took the master's qualification, in 1946, at the "Pasquale Villari school", then the year after his high school diploma at "Umberto high school", as a private owner".
Academic activity.
Graduated in medieval history, and subsequently in literature at the Federico II University of Naples, in 1956 he won a scholarship, made available by the Italian Institute for Historical Studies, of which he would later become secretary.
In 1963 he obtained a free lecturer and taught at the universities of Salerno, Cagliari and Naples.
He has been Professor of Medieval and Modern History at the Frederick University since 1966. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Literature and Philosophy of the same university from 1972 to 1979. He was a professor of modern history at the Suor Orsola Benincasa University in Naples.
He has been president of the Neapolitan Society of Homeland History since 1980; member of the scientific council of the Higher School of Historical Studies of San Marino. He was president of the Venice Biennale from December 1978 to March 1983 and of the European Society of Culture from 1982 to 1988. From 1977 he was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.
Politics.
Member of the Italian Republican Party, he was a municipal councilor in Naples from 1970 to 1993, of which he was also Assessor for Public Education from 1970 to 1973. In 1975 he was appointed mayor of the city, but he gave up his position because he was unable to set up a government.

Between 1983 and 1987 he was undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Heritage (first and second Craxi government). In this office he was the author of a series of ministerial decrees that imposed restrictions on various landscape assets (so-called "galassini"): he subsequently gave this administrative complex a more solid legislative foundation than that offered by the previous Bottai law of 1 June 1939, no. 1089, promoting the law 8 August 1985, n. 431 for the protection of the landscape (known as the "Galasso law"). From 1988 to 1991 (De Mita government / sixth Andreotti government) he served as undersecretary of the Ministry for extraordinary intervention in the South.
Journalistic activity.
Galasso also carried out an intense journalistic activity, as a columnist and protagonist of cultural debates: among many, that of April 2007 in the "Corriere della Sera" around the homologation of the Risorgimento - and then of the Rinascimento - as an ante -litteram, which he clearly rejected. He has collaborated with numerous national newspapers and periodicals: Il Mattino, Il Corriere della Sera, La Stampa, L'Espresso, among the main ones. He directed the magazine Comprendre, official organ of the Venetian Foundation "European Society of Culture".

Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute

The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute (CNMI) () is a medical institute of the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University in Thailand. In addition to providing medical services to the general public, it is also one of the two main facilities for training students of the faculty.
History.
The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute was initiated from King Bhumibol's royal address regarding the construction of a medical facility for both treatment and education in the Samut Prakan Area. This is to increase the number of healthcare services provided for local residents, as most citizens in the area work in the secondary sector in factories and industrial plants. It would also provide medical services for provinces in the eastern region of Thailand including: Chonburi Province, Rayong Province, Chanthaburi Province, Trat Province, Chachoengsao Province, Prachinburi Province and Sa Kaeo Province. Furthermore, the majority of hospitals located in Samut Prakan are of the private sector, unaffordable to those with lower income. 
With regards to the faculty, the increased numbers of patients and the extremely limited space of Ramathibodi Hospital in central Bangkok meant expansion was very difficult. Furthermore, Ramathibodi Hospital primarily handles tertiary care patients, meaning there was very little opportunity for medical students to have primary and secondary care exposure.
It was built in commemoration of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 7th cycle (84th) birthday anniversary on 5 December 2011 to increase the outreach of medical services in Samut Prakan Province and neighbouring provinces as well as increasing opportunities for the medical treatment in the locality. 
The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute opened on 25 December 2017 by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. In 2020, it was used as an isolation facility for patients infected by COVID-19 admitted by the Faculty of Medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients were transferred here for medical care from the main Ramathibodi Hospital site in central Bangkok.
Medical education at the site was initiated in the 2021 academic year.

Around Brazil

Around Brazil is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in 2005 and released by ACT Music.
Recording and music.
The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in September 2005. All of the tracks were recorded at the Rainbow Studio in Oslo, except for "Partita de Março", which was recorded in Cologne. The album was produced by Siegfried Loch.
Nabatov plays prepared piano on "Depois que o Ilê passar". "Valsa de Pôrto Das Caixas" is a delicate waltz by Antônio Carlos Jobim. On "Partita de Março", the formal theme gradually emerges, "almost like the sculptor finding the form that is already present in the uncut stone." It quotes Jobim's "Waters of March" and Bach.
Release and reception.
"Around Brazil" was released in Germany by ACT Music on 26 May 2006. It was the fifth in their Piano Works series. "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" described it as "a quite extraordinary essay in modern pianism [...] he takes each piece out into areas of creative improvisation that no one else would have thought of". They also highlighted the extreme separation of bass and treble in the recording. The MusicWeb reviewer wrote that, "If you care about good jazz – or good music of any kind – you need to buy this CD."

Archibald Cary Smith

Archibald Cary Smith (September 4, 1837 December 8, 1911), professionally known as A. Cary Smith, was a naval architect and marine engineer. He studied marine painting for a short time and did some art work. He is known as the first American to develop the concept of designing a yacht on paper using calculations and comparisons. The method of drafting has since been followed in many educational institutions and universities for the teaching of yacht construction.
Smith designed the first iron yacht in America. In his 55-year career he designed many yachts. One of those was for the German Emperor who had previously bought on the market a yacht Smith designed and was so pleased with it that he then ordered a bigger version. Smith was associated with several yacht clubs and societies.
Biography.
Smith was born at New York City on September 4, 1837. He was named after Archibald Cary, an ancestor. Smith's parents were Rev. Dr. E. Dunlap Smith and Jane B. Cary Smith. He had several siblings. Smith's family came to New York City from Philadelphia. He was educated at the University Grammar School of New York City. Smith's paternal grandfather was an ironmaster and had gone to sea as a sailor. Smith was inspired to travel because of his grandfather's adventures and became interested in sailing. In New York City near his father’s church at a street corner was a community water pump. As a young boy, he and his companion friends would dam the streets and then pump water into them to make a small pond. They then would float a homemade sailing craft on their street pond. This was his first experience as a naval architect.
Smith lived near the yard where the yacht "America" was being built. He spent his time at the yard watching its construction. He then went home and reproduced her in small models he would make of the yacht. He had a strong desire to build boats so was allowed to go to Pamrapo in New Jersey under the tutoring of Captain Bob Fish, a professional yacht skipper. From him he learned the practical side of yacht building and sailing. He later took one term of naval architecture under W.W. Bates, who was a shipwright and later Commissioner of Navigation.
Smith built "Comment" early in his career in 1860. It was an 18-foot sloop. The craft defeated all rivals for years in competition races and built a reputation. In time Smith became known as a skilled helmsman of yachts in New York. Later he abandoned yachts and took up marine painting under Mauritz de Haas for a short time. It was during this time he came up with ideas other than being an artist. Robert Center came to America from Europe in 1870 and sought Smith's aid in designing and building an iron yacht in America based on the design of the English cutter "Mosquito." Center had with him a copy of Marrett's English book on how to design a yacht using a drawing on paper. Smith then studied the book and designed in 1870 the cutter "Vindex" that was built for Center. It was built by Reaney, Son &amp; Archbold in Chester, Pennsylvania, on the Delaware River in 1871.
The Vindex was the first American iron yacht. It was designed by Smith as a systematic drawing instead of using the rule-o-thumb method of working off a wooden model as was done up to that time. The experience designing the "Vindex" started Smith on his career of designing yachts on drawings using calculation, which became the new method of all yacht construction. From that time on in his career he designed every class of yachts and schooners using systematic calculated drawings. This new method was then taught at Cornell University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the Webb Academy at New York. After a 55-year career as a naval designer, Smith died in New York City on December 8, 1911.
Yachts designed.
Smith as a naval architect and marine engineer designed several yachts and schooners. Among these were "Comment" (1860), "Intrepid" (1878), "Mischief" (1879), "Norma" (1879), "Fortuna" (1883), "Priscilla" (1885), "Cinderella" (1886), "Iroquois" (1886), "Banshee" (1887), and the "Yampa" (1887). He designed the steamers "New York," that was the first steam pilot boat in the New York harbor; "City of Lowell," "Chester W. Chapin," "Refuge" and "Free Lance" that were used at Long Island Sound. He also designed and built the iron yacht "Vindex."
Smith designed the schooner yacht "Meteor III" for the German Emperor in 1902, which came about from the previous yacht "Yampa". Smith had originally designed and built "Yampa" for Chester W. Chapin, which in time came into the hands of the emperor. The Kaiser desired to have an additional similar yacht as the Yampa, however bigger and faster, so contacted Smith to design one.
Society memberships.
Smith was associated with the Society of Naval Architects and Engineers. He was a board member of the Larchmont Yacht Club and New York Yacht Club. Smith was an active member of the Seawanhaka Yacht Club when it was renamed the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club in 1882. He gave lectures at the Club on how to design and construct yachts because of his extensive experience. Examples of his lectures were "How to Build a Yacht" and "Construction of Keel Yachts."

Shushi Carpet Museum

Shushi Carpet Museum () was founded by Vardan Astsatryan in 2011. The museum opened its doors to the public in 2013, when its location, Shusha (, Շուշի), Azerbaijan was under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh.
71 rugs and carpets from the Shushi Carpet Museum are on display in Yerevan at the National Museum-Institute of Architecture after Alexander Tamanyan.
History.
The original collection was composed of two parts. The founding private collection included old carpets made by famous Armenian carpet weavers from different villages in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The second part of the collection comprised old Armenian carpets found and bought by its founder, Vardan Astsatryan, from Austria, Switzerland, Turkey (Istanbul), and Germany.
Until November 1, 2020, the museum had two buildings under its supervision. A fund was established in 2011 by donors from the United States. In 2012, a proper building was designated for displaying the carpets given by donors from Moscow, Russia.
The museum had carpets on display, as well as traditional Historical and cultural artifacts. These artifacts received expert evaluation, underwent restoration and then were put on display.
Until the end of October 2020, the museum consisted of about three hundred (300) carpets and flat weaves. This original collection had dated from the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century. The majority of the collection presented traditional Karabakh carpet-weaving and Armenian carpet-weaving styles. In addition to the locally woven carpets, there were Turkoman, Afghan and Persian rugs, carpets, and flat weaves in the museum's collection. There were also Russian cultural artifacts in the museum. During his visit to the museum in August 2013, the President of the Republic of Artsakh Bako Sahakyan stated that the carpet museum plays an important role in preserving our national traditions and values and also for the development of tourism.
On October 29, 2020, an explosion of a large rocket, amidst heavy shelling of the city of Shushi (Azerbaijani: "Şuşa") by Azerbaijani Armed Forces during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, damaged the museum buildings. On November 1, 2020, the most valuable items of the collection (about 160 carpets and rugs) were evacuated to Yerevan (Armenia) to avoid further destruction. The remainder of the collection, consisting of 100–120 carpets as well as other cultural artifacts were left in Shusha.
Currently, the collection is on display in the National Museum-Institute of Architecture after Alexander Tamanyan and History Museum of Armenia

Dancing with the Stars (South African TV series)

Dancing with the Stars SA is a South African dance competition television series that premiered on February 4, 2018 on M-Net. The show is the South African version of the BBC Worldwide format "Dancing with the Stars". The show is produced by Rapid Blue and co-hosted by Tracey Lange and Chris Jaftha.
The format of the show consists of 6 male and 6 female celebrities paired with a professional dancer. Each couple performs predetermined dances and competes against the others for judges' points and audience votes. The couple receiving the lowest combined total of judges' points and audience votes is eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains.
Scoring and voting.
Every dance is scored out of 40 by the four Judges (each judge contributing a score out of 10) and these Judge's scores create the official ranking of the contestants for the week. Pre-registered voters cast their vote during the live show for their favorite couple (a maximum of 100 votes on the website platform and 100 votes on the mobile platform; a total of 200 votes per registered voter). The ranking determined by the judges gives each position on the leaderboard assigned points. With 11 contestants the system works as follows; first place is awarded 11 points, second place is awarded 10 points, third place is awarded 9 points and so on until eleventh place which is awarded 1 point. The public vote is tallied at the end of the Live Show and a ranking is determined based on those votes. Once again, this ranking assigns points based on position. With 11 contestants the system works as follows; first position is awarded 11 points, second position is awarded 10 points, third position is awarded 9 points and so on until eleventh position which is awarded 1 point. For each contestant the points earned by the Judge's ranking and points earned by the public votes are added to create a final score and the couple with the lowest combined score is eliminated.
Times and reception.
The show airs on M-Net on a Sunday at 17:00 to 19:00 and the Live Results Show takes place after M-Net's flagship Investigative show "Carte Blanche" from 20:00 to 20:30.

Kids Saving the Rainforest

Kids Saving the Rainforest (KSTR) is a Costa Rica-based non-governmental non-profit 501 C3 organization founded in 1999 to plant trees in depleted areas of the country, and to rescue, rehabilitate and, when possible, release the animals who live in these forests. Since its inception, Kids Saving the Rainforest has planted or is in the process of planting nearly 100,000 trees and rescued and rehabilitated 3,000 wild animals, two-thirds of which have been released back into the wild.
KSTR's mission is: "to protect the diverse wildlife of Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast by rehabilitating wildlife, conducting original scientific research, training volunteers, and promoting conservation."
History.
Kids Saving the Rainforest was founded in February 1999 by two nine-year old girls, Janine Licare and Aislin Livingstone, who were living in the jungle of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. The girls made paper-mache bottles and painted rocks and sold them by the side of the road to raise money for saplings that would be planted in the nearby forest.
Since then, KSTR has become a fully functional environmental organization with a board of directors. Licare's mother, Jennifer Rice is president. The staff includes a number of full-time people plus volunteers.
KSTR is located outside Manual Antonio, Costa Rica, but has projects in 18 countries.
Programs.
Rescue, rehabilitate and release.
KSTR rescues and rehabs animals that are brought to their facility. In addition, the ones that can not be released back into the wild are given sanctuary for life on the property. The goal is to release as many animals as possible. With an average of 200 rescues a year, over 75 species have been rescued at their center. This includes, among others, two- and three-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, kinkajous, coatis, marmosets, tamarins, orange-chinned parakeets.
Wildlife bridges.
KSTR started a Wildlife Bridge Program in 2000, originally to protect the endangered titi monkeys (squirrel monkey). They have since put up 130 bridges and 14 different animal species have been using them. Meanwhile, the titi monkey population has doubled. Whenever an arboreal animal is electrocuted by live wires, hit by a car, or attacked by dogs, KSTR reviews the necessity of a bridge and places it for them to cross high off the ground. 
Reforestation.
Since its inception, KSTR has planted over 7,000 trees, is in the process of planting another 80,000 on donated property elsewhere in Costa Rica, and reforests in other countries as well. 
Volunteers.
In order to run its facility and care for the animals, KSTR relies on volunteers who come in from around the world to help with all aspects of its programs. The volunteers clean, repair, and build cages, work on trails, prepare food for the animals, observe behavior, and more. Many volunteers are housed where they work at KSTR, but some opt for a day of volunteer work offered by area tour companies.
Education.
A key element of KSTR is education about biodiversity conservation. Visitors who take the tours of the facility are given an educational talk about the rainforest and its inhabitants.
Funding.
KSTR operates entirely on donations.

In the region referred to locally as the "Seven Rivers" area (the seven rivers being the Jardine, MacDonald, Skardon, Doughboy, Ducie and Jackson Rivers, and Crystal Creek), which constitutes the very narrow coastal stretch from the northern side of Port Musgrave as far as the Doughboy River, and also the inland area of Crystal Creek and the middle Jardine River, were the "aŋkamuṯi" -speaking people. The non-coastal "aŋkamuṯi" of the Jardine River were alternatively called "yampaɣuƫaŋu" or "utuðanamu" (meaning "leaf people" and "scrub dwellers" respectively). The "aŋkamuṯi" have previously been referred to in the literature by the name "ŋkamuṯi" ("Gamiti" in Roth 1910:96), "Ngkamadyi" in McConnel (1939-1940:60) and "Nggammadi" in Sharp (1939:257), which was used for the "aŋkamuṯi" by the CV-dropping groups to the south of Port Musgrave (Crowley 1981:146).

He later moved on to play leading roles, and appear in other high-profile Tamil films such as "Sketch" (2018).
Career.
Born in Chennai, Abhishek finished schooling at Kola Saraswathi Vaishnav Senior Secondary School and then completed his Bachelor of Business Administration from Madras University, before beginning a career in modelling during 2004. Abhishek worked in advertisements and the modelling circuit in Chennai and first acted in Malayalam film "Casanovva" with Mohanlal.

South River (Ontario)

The South is a river in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound District, Ontario, beginning in the Western Uplands of Algonquin Provincial Park and emptying into Lake Nipissing. The river takes its name from an arm of Lake Nipissing into which it flows, South Bay.
Geography.
Situated in the northwestern quadrant of the Algonquin Dome (of which the Almaguin Highlands form the western edge) the headwaters of the South are located in wetlands north of Togo Lake at an elevation of 465 m. The river heads in a northwesterly direction, meandering through the Almaguin Highlands before emptying into Lake Nipissing at 195m, descending some 270m along its course.
Tributaries.
The South has a number of smaller tributaries, chief among them are, Paul, Beatty, Genesee, McGillvray, Black (Gurd), Trout, Bray, Black (Machar), Smyth, and Craig.
Communities.
An estimated 4750 people live along the South, the river itself giving rise to many villages in the Highlands, including Nipissing, Powassan, Trout Creek, and the eponymous South River. These communities were built around the rapids and waterfalls along the river, harnessing the energy and force of the cascading water to power sawmills in the 19th century. Logging was the chief industry in the region, attracting many pioneers, settlers, immigrants, and lumber barons, all seeking a livelihood from the vast resources of timber that abounded in the river’s watershed.
The South flows through the following townships: (from upstream to downstream) Paxton (unorganized Nipissing District), Joly, Laurier, Machar, Gurd, Powassan (South Himsworth), and Nipissing.
Hydroelectricity.
There are numerous control and electricity producing dams located on the South, making use of the rapids and waterfalls much the same way the early sawmills did. Ownership of the dams is a mix of private companies and government corporations.
Tourism.
The South has always been a popular canoe route, with arguably the most famous person to paddle its waters and take inspiration from it, being the early 20th century artist Tom Thomson. In the Village of South River on the shores of the waterway is located the Tom Thomson Park, the site in which Thomson would pull his canoe from the river and board the train bound for his studio and clients in Southern Ontario.
The Municipality of Powassan organizes a canoe race every summer along the portion of the river within its boundaries.
There are numerous wilderness outfitters and tourist camps interspersed with private cottages and homes dotting the shores of the South.

Nun's Island Distillery

Nun's Island Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery which operated in Galway, Ireland, from at least 1815, and possibly as early as the late 1700s, until circa 1908.
At its peak, in the late 1800s, output at the distillery reached 400,000 gallons per annum, and with a workforce of over 100, the distillery was one of the largest local employers. Owned by the Persse family from the 1840s onwards, the distillery produced single pot still whiskey known as Persse's Galway Whiskey. The whiskey was sold locally in Connacht, where for much of the 1800s, Nun's Island was the only licensed distillery. However, it was also exported, and is said to have been a sold to the British House of Commons, a fact proudly noted on their labels.
Production at the distillery ceased circa 1908, with the remaining stocks wound down off over several few years.
A bottle of Persse's whiskey was placed for auction in 2002 with a reserve price of £100,000 - however, it failed to sell. The bottle later sold for £3,300 in 2014.
History.
The early history of the distillery is somewhat difficult to piece together. It is known that a distillery on Nun's Island was being operated on by a John Joyce in the late 1700s. This distillery, which was subsequently taken over by Patrick Joyce, is thought to have ceased operations in 1807.
A Patrick Joyce is recorded as running a small distillery on Nun's Island again in 1823. Therefore, it is possible that the closure was temporary. By 1828, output at the distillery had increased to 130,000 proof gallons per annum. There are claims that the distillery ceased operations again in the late 1830s. However, a newspaper advertisement from 1841 reports that a distillery "lately occupied and worked" by Messrs. James and Patrick Joyce was to be sold on 4 February 1841. The advertisement noted that the distillery was held under a 300-year lease, which had commenced in August 1815. This tallies with Alfred Barnard's 1887 report that Joyce's owned the distillery from 1815 to 1840.
In about 1840 or 1841, the distillery was purchased by the Persses, a local family who ran several other distilleries in the area. There is some conflicting information with regard to the precise and nature of the sale date. Barnard reported that the distillery was sold by the Encumbered Claims Courts in 1840. However, a newspaper article from the era reports that the distillery was to be sold by private contract in February 1841. As Barnard mentions that the Persses enlarged the original operation, the confusion may be due to piecemeal purchases of different sections of the site, or delays in finalising the sale as the distillery had been repeatedly advertised for sale beginning in at least early 1840.
Initially the Persses converted the distillery to a woollen mill, which was known for producing excellent friezes. However, when their lease on the nearby Newcastle Distillery expired in 1846, they moved their distilling operations at the Nun's Island complex, and re-established the site as a distillery.
In 1886, the distillery was visited by British historian Alfred Barnard, as recounted in his seminal publication "The Whiskey Distilleries of the United Kingdom". Barnard noted that at the time of his visit Nun's Island was the sole distillery operating in Connacht, and had an output of about 400,000 gallons per annum. In addition to offices, workshops, stables, and storehouses, the distillery buildings included two lofty Maltings and Corn stores built of stone, five storeys of which were devoted to the storing of corn, and two to malting purposes; an elegant brew house equal to any in Ireland; a back house containing thirteen washbacks, each with a capacity of about 18,000 gallons; a still house containing a 16,000 gallon wash still, a 10,000 gallon spirit still, and a 6,000 gallon low-wines still; a spirit store occupied by a 12,000 gallon vat; and five warehouses, holding a total of about 5,000 casks at the time.
Like many other Irish distilleries, Nun's Island encountered financial difficulties during the early part of the 20th Century, is thought to have closed shortly before World War I.
Since closing, some of the distillery complex has been demolished. However, several of the main distillery buildings, notably the large riverside warehouse, are still extant.

Maureen Baginski

Maureen A. Baginski is a former Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) director at the National Security Agency (NSA), and executive assistant director of intelligence at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
Early life and education.
Before beginning her intelligence career, Baginski graduated with a BA and MA in Slavic languages and linguistics from the University of Albany, where she also received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 2005 for her service to the nation.
Public sector career.
Baginski began her career in intelligence in 1979 as a Russian language instructor at the NSA during the Cold War. She held various positions over her nearly quarter-century at the NSA, including lead analyst for the Soviet Union, assistant deputy director of technology and systems, chief officer of the director, executive assistant to the director of NSA/Central Security Service, senior operations officer in the National Security Operations Center, and SIGINT director, NSA's third highest position. Baginski was the SIGINT director on September 11, 2001, and was critical to the NSA's response after the terrorist attacks while also directing the Extended SIGINT Enterprise in order to acquire, produce, and disseminate foreign SIGINT to a variety of government and military customers.
In the documentary film “A Good American”, then-senior NSA executive Thomas Drake quotes Baginski as saying “9/11 is a gift to NSA. We’re gonna get all the money we need and then some,” in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Retired NSA Analyst Bill Binney - the star of the film - describes Baginski’s reaction as “sickening.” 
In 2003, Baginski left her position at the NSA to become the executive assistant director of Intelligence at the FBI. As the executive assistant director of Intelligence at the FBI between 2003-2005, Baginski successfully led the bureau's first-ever intelligence program. She was in charge of adapting the FBI's intelligence capabilities with information technologies, and created an intelligence-sharing platform that helped identify and stop terror plots. As the head of intelligence at the FBI, Baginski helped develop an intelligence career service so that intelligence professionals would be able to advance in their careers at the FBI. Many high-ranking government officials, including President George W. Bush and FBI Director Mueller, acknowledged and applauded Baginski's significant changes at the FBI which improved its capabilities to safeguard the United States of America. Upon her retirement from the FBI, Director Mueller asked Baginski to remain as a senior advisor to the FBI, a position which she accepted.
Private sector career.
Since retiring from the FBI, Baginski has held multiple positions within the private sector. She has been a board member at BearingPoint Inc., Argon ST, and SI International Inc. Baginski has also been President of National Security Systems at SPARTA Inc., chief executive officer at National Security Partners LLC, and Chairwoman Emeriti of AFCEA.
Awards.
Throughout and after her career in the public sector, Baginski received several awards, including two Presidential Rank Awards, two Director of Central Intelligence National Achievement Medals, the Director of Military Intelligence’s Leadership Award, and NSA’s Exceptional Civilian Service Award, and the FBI Intelligence Analysts Association Award.

Cap and Bells (horse)

Cap and Bells (known in England as Cap and Bells II, 1898 – after 1916) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After showing promising form in the United States as a juvenile in 1900 she was set to race in England. In June 1901 on her British debut she recorded an emphatic win in the Epsom Oaks, becoming the first American horse to do so. She never recaptured her Epsom form and was retired from racing in 1903. After returning to United States she had some success as a broodmare.
Background.
Cap and Bells was a bay or brown mare bred in Kentucky by the father and son partnership of James R. Keene and Foxhall Keene the latter of whom owned her during her racing career. She was initially sent into training in the United States.
She was from the second of only two crops of foals sired by Domino, an outstanding American racehorse who died in 1897 at the age of six. Her dam, the British-bred mare Ben-My-Chree, was a daughter of Ulster Queen, making her a close relative of Louvois (2000 Guineas) and Louviers (runner-up in the Epsom Derby).
Racing career.
1900: two-year-old season.
At Brighton Beach Racetrack on 24 July Cap and Bells won the Spinster Stakes, beating the favourite Sweet Lavender "with ease". On 25 August the filly was stepped up in class for the Belmont Futurity Stakes which at that time was the most important race for two-year-olds in the United States. She led the field until the home but faded down the stretch and finished unplaced behind W. C. Whitney's Ballyhoo Bey. Shortly after the race it was announced that Keene intended to campaign his filly in England in 1901.
1901: three-year-old season.
On her arrival in England Cap and Bells entered training with Sam Darling at his stable at Beckhampton in Wiltshire.
On 7 June Cap and Bells, ridden by the American jockey Milton Henry, was one of twenty-one fillies to contest the 123rd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The race was run in fine weather in front of a near-record crowd. Despite her lack of experience on the surface (turf) and the distance she was made the 9/4 favourite, with Lord Derby's filly Santa Brigida (third in the 1000 Guineas) the only one of her opponents to start at less than 10/1. She had not been among the favourites in the build-up but was heavily backed on the morning of the race. The favourite's stablemate Noonday set the pace and led the field into the straight but Cap and Bells went to the front soon after and drew away to win "in a canter" by six lengths. Lord Ellesmere's 50/1 outsider Sabrinetta (ridden by the American C Jenkins) finished second, with three lengths back to Minnie Dee (owned by Richard Croker and ridden by another American Lester Reiff) in third place. According to the "Los Angeles Herald" "the race furnished extraordinary proof of the superior ability of American breeders, trainers and jockeys". Foxhall Keene donated the prize-money to British and American charities, including the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund.
Later that year, Keene reportedly declined an offer to match his filly against W. C. Whitney's Epsom Derby winner Volodyovski.
1902: four-year-old season.
Cap and Bells remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover her best form. In the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June she finished tailed-off in last place behind William the Third. Cap and Bells returned to the United States in 1903.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cap and Bells a "superior" winner of the Oaks.
Breeding record.
At the end of her racing career, Cap and Bells was retired to become a broodmare for the Keenes' stud. he produced at least eight foals between 1905 and 1916:

Nicolas Saboly

Nicolas Saboly (30 January 1614 – 26 July 1675) was a French poet, composer and choirmaster. He composed many Christmas carols in the Provençal dialect which form one of the monuments of poetry in that language and have been repeatedly republished until the present day.
Life.
Nicolas Saboly was born on 31 January 1614 in Monteux to a family of herdsmen.
His great-grandfather Claude Saboly and his grandfather Raymond Saboly followed this occupation. 
It was Raymond Saboly who came to settle in Monteux.
Nicolas was the youngest son of Felisa Meilheuret and Jean Saboly.
He had an older brother named Jean-Pierre Saboly and three sisters named Anne, Félicia (Felisa) and Claire.
Student destined for the priesthood.
Saboly's father died on 15 August 1619, and Nicolas entered the Jesuit college of Carpentras. 
At the end of his schooling he became a member of the Congregation of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin on 14 May 1628.
In the autumn of 1628 he left his college to begin taking classes at the University of Avignon. 
He received the tonsure in 1630 and attended courses in law and theology, as evidenced by two notarial acts of 12 March 1632 and 27 December 1633, which he witnessed as a student of theology. 
In 1634 he left the University without taking his degrees. 
On 27 September 1635 he was ordained a sub-deacon, deacon and priest.
Career as choirmaster.
In 1639 Nicolas Saboly obtained the position of organist and choirmaster of the Saint-Siffrein Cathedral() in Carpentras.
He was occasionally employed in local festivals, such as on 22 September 1639 when the clergy of Caromb asked him to play the organ for the parish festival of St. Maurice.
He received 10 florins and 12 sous for his performance.
His name disappears from the accounts of Saint-Siffrein after 20 June 1643, when he was replaced by the choirmaster David.
Nicolas Saboly went to Arles where he was choirmaster from 1643 to 1646, then the cathedral of Aix-en-Provence from 1652 to 1655.
He was in Nîmes in 1659.
He was choirmaster of the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon() from before 1668 until his death.
Ecclesiastical benefices.
Like many priests of his time, Saboly obtained several ecclesiastical benefits. 
On 16 April 1633 he became chaplain of St. Mary Magdalene in the Cathedral of Saint Siffrein in Carpentras.
He kept this benefice until 1663.
On 28 March 1658 he was issued a certificate of studies that found he had attended courses at the University of Avignon from 1628 to 1634, and was given a certificate of aptitude for obtaining profits in the dioceses of Nîmes and Uzès.
On 10 June 1660, after a lengthy process, he obtained a pension of 100 lt. (livre tournois) from the papal administration to take on the priory and the benefit of Saint-Benoît-de-Cayran in the diocese of Uzès.
After returning to Avignon he obtained the chaplaincy of Saint Mary, which he still held in 1663.
Testament and death.
On 21 April 1671 Saboly's will was notarized by François Julien in Marseilles.
Saboly made his niece Claire Saboly (wife of Christophe Chardenas, bourgeois of Roquemaure, Gard) ) his universal heiress. 
He also bequeathed 600 lt. to his servant Isabeau Sevique, and reserved from his niece's legacy an annuity with 600 lt. of capital yielding 30 lt. annually to be paid to the chapter of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon so that after his death two masses would be said each week in his memory. 
He died four years later on 25 July 1675 in Avignon.
He is buried in the choir of the Saint-Pierre church.
Saboly's career as a choirmaster was standard for this period. 
He is famous for the carols that he composed.
Works.
Printed works.
First editions in fascicle.
The first editions of Saboly's carols consist of eight bound instalments, dated between 1668 and 1674, kept in Paris Ars. : BL 9478. The titles of the instalments are:
Editions in collection with other authors.
In the second part of the 19th century Saboly's were often published with those of Antoine Peyrol (18th century) and Joseph Roumanille (1818-1891). 
These many editions reflect the literary movement of the Félibriges. The list below is not exhaustive.
List of carols.
Saboly did not compose all the Christmas carols that were attributed to him. 
They were originally published without music because they were sung to popular tunes that everyone knew by heart.
Saboly simply gave a note like "on the air of the echo", "on the air of the pastouro" or sometimes "On an air by Saboly".
The Provencal Documentation Center has retained in its booklet devoted to this author a list of 48 carols definitely composed by Saboly.
Following are the carols are according to the François Seguin edition of 1856:
First book (1667)
Second book (1668)
Third book (1669)
Fourth book, titled "Story of the birth of Jesus Christ" (1670)
Fifth book (1671)
Sixth book (1672)
Seventh book (1673)
Eighth book (1674)

Couleé-D

Couleé-D is an extended play (EP) by American drag performer Shea Couleé, released on June 23, 2017. Ahead of the EP's release, music videos co-directed by Shea Couleé were released for all three songs on June 22. The collection was produced by Shea Couleé and VAM studio. Fellow "RuPaul's Drag Race" contestant The Vixen is featured on the track "Cocky".
Composition and production.
The visual album "Couleé-D" has three tracks with accompanying music videos: "Ride", "Cocky", featuring fellow "RuPaul's Drag Race" contestant The Vixen as well as Lila Star, and "Feeling So". She recorded a total of eleven tracks, but decided not to release a larger collection. She said, "There [are] all these different sounds and different vibes—there's also really great stuff that's unreleased that I'm holding onto because I think what I want to do is to just release smaller albums, EPs and then have visuals for all them and continue telling the stories."
According to "Out"'s Rose Dommu, the EP "doesn't have a particular narrative' and offers "three distinct elements of Couleé’s drag persona". The videos were co-produced by Shea Couleé and the Chicago-based production company VAM, and filmed locally immediately following her appearance of RuPaul's DragCon LA.
Songs.
Shea Couleé has said of the opening track, "'Ride' is the really laid back band-jam homegirl jam that she would listen to [while] smoking a blunt with your friends—just like chilling at a cookout". She said of the second song: "'Cocky' actually came about because [during "Drag Race"], there was a contestant that had been kinda running her mouth in the streets about me and calling me 'Cocky' after her exit. I've always prided myself on being able to maintain a sense of humility and perspective about my abilities and what it is that I can do as an artist and performer. So I was really like, 'Oh yeah girl?'"
On the origins of the EP's third and final track, Shea Couleé has recalled: 
Release and promotion.
The EP was released unexpectedly on June 23, 2017, coinciding with the finale of the ninth season of RuPaul's Drag Race, preceded only by "Out" exclusive release of the three accompanying music videos on June 22.
Reception.
James Besanvalle of "Gay Star News" said the EP and accompanying music videos, "all with very different vibes", "show a unique diversity" of Shea Couleé and "[prove] she's a triple threat – she can dance, sing and act". "Out" Rose Dommu said the music videos "[cement] her as one of the most versatile, talented and hard-working queens in "Drag Race" herstory".

Toowoomba East State School

Toowoomba East State School is a heritage-listed state school on the corner of Arthur and Mary Streets, East Toowoomba, Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1935 to 1936 by the Queensland Department of Public Works. It was originally known as Queen's Park State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2017.
History.
Toowoomba East State School (SS) opened in 1887, on its current site east of Queens Park, to service the population growth in East Toowoomba at the time. The school is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. The school retains a Depression-era brick school building (Block A, 1936); set in landscaped grounds, with sporting facilities and mature trees. The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment.
Traditional country of the Giabal and Jarowair people, European settlement of the Toowoomba area commenced in 1840 when squatters occupied pastoral runs on the Darling Downs. At the junction of two routes to Gorman's and Hodgson's gaps through the Main Range, the small settlement of Drayton evolved from 1842 as a stopping place for pastoralists and travellers. Six kilometres to its north-east was an area known as "The Swamp" – renamed Toowoomba by 1859 – which was first surveyed in 1849 as 12 suburban allotments of Drayton.
Toowoomba grew rapidly due to its superior land and water supply, support from squatters and land speculators, and, from 1855, providing an easier route to Brisbane via the Toll Bar Road. Toowoomba was declared a municipality (the Borough of Toowoomba) in July 1860, and by the 1861 census it was clear that Toowoomba had eclipsed Drayton. The Main Line railway arrived in 1867 (connecting to Brisbane in 1876), and Toowoomba's economy diversified to include numerous small-scale manufacturing outlets, while the majority of administrative, service and other government and education functions for the surrounding region were centred on the town. Toowoomba was also popular as a summer retreat for the colony's elite. It was declared a city (the City of Toowoomba) in 1904 and by 1911 had a population of 10,636.
Toowoomba was an early centre for education, with the area's first National School (later Toowoomba South State School) opening in 1865. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early/new communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.
To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.
Toowoomba East SS, opened on 17 January 1887, was established on a 2.5 acre (1ha) reserve for a National School at the corner of Mary Street and Margaret Street, which had been gazetted in 1872. Although there was local pressure for a school in East Toowoomba from 1876, when fund raising by the community began, the population was not large enough to justify a state school. As a result of later population growth, the Queensland Government approved a school in East Toowoomba in October 1885. By this time the community had collected £200 of the £290 required as its one-fifth share of the £1433 construction cost, and the school was also initially referred to as Queen's Park State School. The school consisted of a timber building set on brick piers, with two classrooms, close to the corner of Mary Street and Arthur Street. It was designed to accommodate 250 students, and had admitted 235 students by February 1887.
Growing student numbers – with 778 enrolled by 1927 – soon led to additions to Toowoomba East SS. By 1913 there were three timber buildings; a fourth (Infants) wing was added in 1928; and a fifth wing in 1932. A school residence, built in 1889, stood in the southeast corner of the reserve, fronting Mary Street; and a school bell on a stand was erected the same year.
As well as more buildings, the school required larger grounds to cater for growing student numbers. In 1926, 1.25 acres (0.5ha) of land was added.
The school was also beautified by tree plantings from 1888, including on the west side of the original school reserve and along its Arthur and Mary Street frontages. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land. Twelve camphor laurels were planted along the west fence in 1898, to provide shelter from westerly winds and by 1922 Toowoomba East SS had "large camphor and other ornamental and shade trees".
The school's timber buildings were still not sufficient for student numbers, and in the mid-1930s a new brick school building was approved for Toowoomba East SS. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of public building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building program to provide impetus to the economy.
Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program administered by the Department of Public Works (DPW). This included painting and repairs to school buildings. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.
In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public building program designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. The construction of substantial brick school buildings in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation.
Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Most were designed in a classical idiom to project the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings, being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.
Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles were derived from contemporary tastes and fashions. Over time, variations occurred in building size, decorative treatment, and climatic-responsive features.
Construction of the Depression-era brick school building (Block A in 2017) at Toowoomba East SS occurred during 1935–36, for a cost of £16,326. The new building was sited parallel to, and facing, Arthur Street, after relocation of the old timber buildings. As the new building was only designed for 640 students, and enrolment was 1000 by the time it was officially opened on 8 May 1937 by James Kane, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for East Toowoomba, it was necessary to retain at least four of the old timber buildings. These were relocated at a distance behind the new brick building to form a parade ground between them. The school residence was removed .
Block A was constructed with three levels, consisting of an undercroft with two floors of eight classrooms above, for a total of 16 classrooms. The undercroft comprised play areas with concrete floors and drinking troughs and had openings leading out to the grounds via broad concrete stairs. The first and second floors had similar layouts. They comprised a long wing of six classrooms divided by a central stairwell. The eastern three classrooms had connecting doors; while the western three classrooms were separated by folding partitions, which could be opened to form a large assembly room. Each classroom was oriented so that students faced west to a wall-mounted hyloplate (blackboard) and had two large banks of windows on their south side, giving gentle southern natural left-hand light to students, forced to write with their right hand. A verandah-like, open corridor ran along the north side of the classrooms providing access. Projecting north from the corridor was a central entrance block. On the first floor this comprised an entry hall, reached from the front garden by a branching stair, with a head teachers and male teachers room, one either side of the hall. On the second floor, this block comprised a female teachers room and a cloak room. At each end of the long wing was a short perpendicular wing, comprising a stairwell, perpendicular corridor, cloak room and another classroom, which had north-facing windows and hyloplates on the east wall to ensure light from the "correct" side. At the landing of the central stairwell between first and second floors was a balconette that opened out to the south side overlooking the parade ground behind.
The walls of the three storeys were differentiated, with painted cement render on the undercroft, exposed brickwork for the first floor up to the window sill height of the second floor, and painted cement render above that to the eaves line. Sunhoods, supported on substantial timber brackets, shaded all banks of windows on the first and second floors. The hipped and gabled roof was clad with asbestos cement shingles, and the three gables on the north side of the building were battened and clad with fibro-cement. A large ventilation fleche topped the centre of the roof above the entrance.
During the 1950s further additions were made to the school's accommodation and grounds. In 1955, additional land was added to the west side of the school grounds, resumed from neighbouring residential allotments. Later grounds extensions, to the west and south of the original school reserve, from the 1960s onwards, meant that by 2012 the grounds covered 3.4ha. By 1956 a highset brick extension (Block B in 2017), with two classrooms had been constructed attached to the west end of the rear (south) of Block A. This building was renovated in , enclosing its verandahs and demolishing the wall between verandahs and classrooms to create larger teaching areas.
Changes were also made to Block A. In 1966, the cloak room at the west end of the first floor was converted into a Health Services room. In , two classrooms at the east end of the first floor of the centre wing were used as staff rooms, while another classroom was used as the principal's office, and another was divided in half by a partition to accommodate a store room and Health Services Room. One cloak room was converted to a store room while another was converted to a work room. In , the undercroft was partially enclosed with glass louvres and doors. The northern corridors were enclosed with glazing by 1997. In , the centre wing was altered in "upgrading" works. This involved partitioning the northern corridors on both floors to create practical learning areas; replacing the French doors from the corridor into the classrooms with a single wide door with a half leaf; demolishing partitions between the classrooms on both floors to create two classrooms out of each set of three; and relining the ceilings with flat sheets to provide fire proofing.
Changes and additions to facilities since the 1960s have included: a school swimming pool (1966); new classroom buildings (1969–71); the removal of three of the early timber school buildings in the 1970s; a new library and a dental clinic facing Mary Street (1973); two pre-school buildings south of the swimming pool, near Margaret Street (by 1978); a Centenary Hall facing Arthur Street; covered ways south of Block A; and a new administration building north of Block A (1991). The last of the early school buildings, the 1928 Infants building (later designated the Clare Gormley Block), was demolished sometime between 2009 and 2011. In 2015, 807 students were enrolled. Students utilise sports fields in Queens Park to the west, and the Clive Berghofer Stadium to the north.
In 2017, Toowoomba East State School continues to operate from its original site, and its Depression-era brick school building is a local landmark. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.
Description.
Toowoomba East State School occupies a large, 3.37ha site in East Toowoomba, fronting Arthur Street to the north and bounded by Mary Street to the east. A substantial Depression-era brick school building, Block A, stands at the front of the school grounds, surrounded by mature trees and gardens. Attractive views are visible to and from the school and it is conspicuous in the area due to its handsome architecture, open playing fields, and impressive mature trees.
Block A (1936).
Block A is a symmetrical two-storey building set high on an open undercroft level and has a hipped and gabled roof clad with tiles. At the roof's central peak is a prominent metal ventilation fleche with round cupola, visible from the surrounding residential neighbourhood. The building character expresses a composed simplicity through the use of attractive, simple, and low maintenance materials with minimal decorative features, including extensive use of glazed dark face bricks internally and externally contrasting with smooth-rendered concrete dressings and plain, regular fenestration.
The building comprises an undercroft level of open play spaces below two levels of teaching rooms and its facades are defined horizontally with three materials: smooth-rendered masonry with lined coursing at undercroft level; facebrick for the first floor up to the sill level of the second floor; and painted roughcast render above. The building form is a long wing of classrooms with a centre stairwell. A long corridor across the front (north) of this wing provides access to the rooms. The corridor has simple rendered balustrades with square balusters; it has square openings on the first floor and arched openings on the second floor. However, these openings have been enclosed with later glazing that is not of cultural heritage significance. Projecting forward of the centre of the corridor is an entrance block of primarily teachers' rooms, and at either end of the long wing is a short perpendicular wing comprising a classroom, a former cloak room, and a stairwell. The central entrance block and the end wings are emphasised by front-facing gable roofs with timber battening, banks of multi-paned timber-framed casement windows with fanlights, and window hoods supported by large timber brackets. At the centre of the entrance block is a branching cement rendered stair with simple metal balustrades. It leads up to the front arched doorway, which is flanked by narrow window openings and shaded by a window hood that features a battened triangular pediment.
The building layout is highly intact, retaining its original configuration. The undercroft retains original perimeter seats, metal grilles to openings, and rounded corners to the brick pillars. However, some new lightweight partitions have been installed to create storage spaces, which are not of cultural heritage significance. The undercroft play area is connected to bitumen-surfaced play areas in front and behind the building via multiple openings and broad concrete steps.
The first floor configuration comprises a short entrance hall with teachers rooms either side, leading to the corridor and classrooms behind. The wall between the corridor and the classrooms retains tall, double hung timber-framed windows, and French doors with fanlights, and although some French doors have been replaced with later doors, the fanlights survive throughout. However, the partitions between the classrooms of the centre wing have been removed to create larger classrooms, with nibs and bulkheads retained to indicate their former location. New partitions have been installed in one classroom and to enclose the cloak rooms for further staff rooms, and in the centre wing to create larger classrooms.
The first and second floors are very similar configurations, with identical removal of partitions and similar insertion of new partitions.
On both levels, the classrooms feature abundant natural light, simple timber joinery, and lofty ceilings. The corridors, cloak rooms, stairwells, and stairwells have smooth concrete ceilings, which is the original condition. The classrooms of the end wings retain the original sheets and battens lined ceilings but those of the centre wing are lined with recent flat sheet material and have modern cornices. The stairwells have simple iron balustrades with moulded clear-finished timber handrails and concrete stairs.
At the stair landing between first and second floors of the centre stairwell, a set of timber-framed, glazed French doors lead out onto a narrow balcony that overlooks a parade ground immediately to the rear of the building. Capable of only accommodating one or two people, the balcony is the centre and focus of the southern facade composition, emphasised by a small projecting bay with a triangular pediment at the roofline bearing "1936" in raised, rendered numerals, and including a moulded rendered architrave that stretches up to the second-floor window above, topped by a stylised "keystone". The balcony is supported by scrolled rendered brackets and has a simple metal balustrade with an attached metal flagpole. It draws attention through its use of decoration on an otherwise simple facade and being centred under the tall roof fleche.
Attached to the western end of Block A is a high-set one storey classroom building, Block B (by 1956), which is not heritage-listed. A doorway has been cut into the rear (south) wall of the first floor stairway at this end of Block A to connect through to the building.
Grounds.
The grounds of the school are largely flat with open playing areas and other teaching buildings. The boundaries of the school have mature trees, including camphor laurels ("Cinnamomum camphora") at regularly spaced intervals and other specimen trees, including jacarandas ("Jacaranda mimosifolia").
The main front entrance to the school is emphasised with a metal arch with "EAST STATE SCHOOL" in metal letters over a concrete path flanked by long, stone edged garden beds. This entrance is aligned with the centre of Block A.
Other stone edged garden beds stand around the base of Block A.
At the rear of Block A is a large open bitumen-surfaced parade ground. This is a simple and plain area that provides an unfussy setting to and allows uninterrupted views of Block A, as well as an open and flexible playing and assembly space for the school.
An early metal school bell stands on a tall post in the rear parade ground close to the southern wall of Block A.
Views to Block A occur from the surrounding residential neighbourhood and Toowoomba East State School is an attractive and prominent element in the built landscape.

The place retains an excellent, representative example of a government-designed school building that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies.
The Depression-era brick school building (1936) is a result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programs during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Toowoomba East State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school built during the Depression-era. These include: a large brick school building set in landscaped grounds with mature shade trees, assembly, play, and sports areas.
The Depression-era brick school building is an excellent, substantial, and intact example of its type, demonstrating the principal characteristics, which include: a handsome edifice standing at the front of the school; symmetrical two-storey form of classrooms and teachers rooms above an undercroft of open play spaces; a linear layout of the main floors with rooms accessed by corridors; loadbearing masonry construction; prominent projecting central entrance bay, and high-quality design to provide superior educational environments that focus on abundant natural light and ventilation. It demonstrates the use of stylistic features of its era, which determined its roof form, joinery, and decorative treatment.
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
Through its conspicuous position at the front of the school, substantial size and height, symmetry, elegant composition, restrained use of decoration, and fine craftsmanship, the Depression-era brick school building has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, by which the Department of Public Works sought to convey the concepts of progress and permanence.
The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Framed by mature trees, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.
Toowoomba East State School has a strong and ongoing association with the community. It was established in 1887 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Toowoomba children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Toowoomba and is a prominent community focal point.

The Railway Detective

The Railway Detective is the eponymous opening title in the series of detective mystery novels written by Keith Miles under the pseudonym Edward Marston. Set in 1851, it is about a railway robbery which is investigated and ultimately solved by two Scotland Yard detectives, Inspector Robert Colbeck and Sergeant Victor Leeming. The novel was published in 2004 by Allison &amp; Busby of London. The book's cover depicts part of "The Railway Station" (1862) by William Powell Frith. According to the publishers in a 2018 news release, the series has been optioned for television adaptation by Mammoth Screen.
Plot introduction.
In April 1851, shortly before the opening of the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, a mail train on the London and North Western Railway (L&amp;NWR) is halted between Leighton Buzzard Junction and Linslade Tunnel by a group of men disguised as railway police. Using duplicated Chubb safe keys, they steal all the mailbags and a consignment of over £3,000 in sovereigns being transferred from the Royal Mint to a bank in Birmingham. The train driver, who tries to resist the robbers, is badly injured and his fireman is forced to drive the engine forward to where a section of track has been removed, causing a derailment. The robbers escape and the alarm is raised by telegraph to the Metropolitan Police Force in Scotland Yard, London, where it is received by Detective Superintendent Edward Tallis, head of the Detective Department.
Plot summary.
Tallis summons Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck to his office and orders him to lead the investigation. It is quickly established that there is an "unresolved tension" between Tallis and Colbeck which is an underlying theme of the whole series, although the two have great professional respect for each other. Colbeck and Detective Sergeant Victor Leeming travel to Leighton Buzzard where they meet Inspector Rory McTurk of the railway police. McTurk strongly resents their involvement but Colbeck and Leeming soon establish that members of the railway police were guilty of deserting their posts on the train in order to play cards, thus making it much easier for the gang to carry out the robbery. Meanwhile, train driver Caleb Andrews is not expected to survive and his daughter Madeleine arrives in Leighton Buzzard to care for him.
Colbeck is convinced that the gang had inside information and were certainly in possession of duplicated safe keys. He and Leeming begin enquiries at the organisations involved with the shipment: the L&amp;NWR, the Post Office, the Royal Mint, the fictitious Spurling's Bank in Birmingham and the Chubb factory in Wolverhampton. As a result, they become aware of Daniel Slender, who duplicated the safe keys at Chubb; William Ings of the Post Office, who was involved in the mail train's scheduling; and Albert Woodhead of the Royal Mint, who unwittingly advised Ings of the gold consignment. The L&amp;NWR and the Birmingham bank are absolved of involvement in the crime.
Ings is the first of the suspects to be pursued and Colbeck discovers that he is hiding in the notorious Devil's Acre. To find Ings, Colbeck seeks help from Brendan Mulryne, a former colleague who is now a resident there. Mulryne establishes a connection between Ings and the prostitute Polly Roach but, though he finds Roach, he is too late to prevent the murder of Ings. In due course, Slender meets a similar fate. It is clear to Colbeck that the gang are eliminating loose ends and weak links to remain undetected. Colbeck is concerned about the unnecessary destruction of the steam engine after the robbery and believes he is looking for someone with influence who hates the railways.
Although Tallis dismisses Colbeck's theory, it is valid as gang leader Sir Humphrey Gilzean has an obsessive hatred of railways. He blames them for the accidental death of his wife. The gang strikes again at the Kilsby Tunnel, placing gunpowder at one end in a bid to destroy both the tunnel and a train carrying glass sheets for use in the Crystal Palace. The explosion is detonated too soon to destroy the train and causes only superficial damage to the tunnel. Colbeck makes the connection and realises, despite more opposition from Tallis, that an attempt will be made to destroy the locomotives on display at the Great Exhibition.
Colbeck is right about the Crystal Palace and, aided by Leeming and Mulryne, is able to arrest Jukes and the Seymours one night when they try to destroy the "Lord of the Isles". The gangsters refuse to give information about their leaders. Gilzean and Sholto have added to their haul by blackmailing the senders of complicit letters which were in the stolen mailbags. They are fearful of imminent arrest and Gilzean instructs Sholto to find someone whom Colbeck cares about to distract him from the investigation. Caleb Andrews is no longer a critical case and has been taken home where Madeleine is looking after him. She has met Colbeck in the course of the investigation and there is a mutual attraction between them which develops as the novel progresses. Sholto follows Colbeck and observes the affection he has for Madeleine during a visit to the Andrews household. As a result, Gilzean and Sholto kidnap Madeleine and send a demand to the Met for the release of Jukes and the Seymours.
Working on what little is known about the three prisoners, Colbeck and Leeming discover their common military background and make the link between them and two of their former officers who both left the Army on the same day. These are Gilzean and Sholto. Colbeck establishes that Gilzean has a pathological hatred of railways and even Tallis agrees that the case has been solved, so the investigation is now a manhunt but with Madeleine's life at stake. Fortunately for Madeleine, Gilzean is protective of her and will not allow Sholto to molest her. Tallis leads a raid on Gilzean's Berkshire residence but he bungles it and the criminals escape, still holding Madeleine as a hostage.
Colbeck finds documents in Gilzean's house which convince him they are taking Madeleine to Bristol to board ship and flee the country. The criminals are travelling by road and so Colbeck and Leeming go to Bristol via the Great Western Railway (GWR). They arrive first and intercept the two criminals on board their ship in harbour. Madeleine, unharmed, is freed and reunited with her father. The bond between Colbeck and Madeleine is permanent and, when Colbeck receives two complimentary tickets from the grateful Prince Albert for the opening of the Great Exhibition, he invites Madeleine to join him.
Historical references.
The Detective Department of the Metropolitan Police Force (the Met) was founded in 1842 and so was only nine years old in 1851, when the story is set. Richard Mayne, who was the joint first commissioner of the Met, is depicted in meetings with Tallis, Colbeck and Leeming. His co-commissioner, Charles Rowan, had retired the year before. Mayne was in charge of policing at The Great Exhibition which opened on 1 May and was an outstanding success, thanks in no small part to effective policing. Mayne is the only real person who plays an active part in the novel.
The novel mentions Prince Albert as the exhibition organiser and Joseph Paxton as its main designer. Gilzean's hatred of Paxton was because of Paxton being a director of the Midland Railway, whose chairman John Ellis is an enemy of Gilzean. The "Lord of the Isles" was a noted locomotive which was displayed at the Great Exhibition before it entered service on the Great Western Railway (GWR). Colbeck mentions the 6-2-0 "Liverpool", the "Puffing Billy" and the 4-2-2 "Iron Duke" in the context of the exhibition. In the second book, when Madeleine begins to seriously pursue her hobby of locomotive artworks, the "Lord of the Isles" is her first subject. 
Caleb Andrews drives for the L&amp;NWR but his train was travelling on the route built by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&amp;BR) and opened in 1838. The L&amp;BR was amalgamated into the L&amp;NWR in 1846, having been operational since 1833. Robert Stephenson was the L&amp;BR chief engineer. The line from Euston to Birmingham included the Linslade and Kilsby tunnels which both feature prominently in the book. Marston describes the problems Stephenson faced at Kilsby, where quicksand was unexpectedly encountered. The Crystal Palace's construction materials, its cast iron framework and sheets of glass, were manufactured in Birmingham and Smethwick, so they were transported by rail through the Kilsby tunnel to London.
Train robbery was a new phenomenon in the 1850s. There were two in reality before 1851, both on the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1849. Security was non-existent and the robbers in each case climbed out of their own carriage into the mail van and back. The first major incident was the Great Gold Robbery on the South Eastern Railway in May 1855. The first train robbery in America was by the Reno Gang in Indiana in 1866; there were more infamous robberies in later years by the James–Younger Gang and Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch.
The Birmingham bank manager, Ernest Kitson, explains to Colbeck the purpose of the Bank Charter Act 1844 which was introduced by the late Robert Peel as prime minister. The Act is often called the "Peel Banking Act". It placed strict limits on the issue of banknotes by individual banks who were required to balance all banknotes in their possession with a requisite supply of gold coin or bullion. In the novel, it is because Spurling's fully complied with these rules that a gold consignment was being sent to them.
On his trip to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Colbeck is disturbed by seeing the Black Country and afterwards tells Leeming that he now understands exactly what William Blake meant when he wrote about the "dark, satanic mills". Colbeck is nevertheless intrigued by industry, especially the railways, and in conversations he refers to Edward Bury, Thomas Russell Crampton and Daniel Gooch as engineers and locomotive designers he especially admires. Caleb Andrews speaks well of Alexander Allan, who claimed to be the designer of the Crewe type locomotive involved in the robbery. The engine was a 2-4-0 introduced by the L&amp;NWR for freight in 1845. Allan was L&amp;NWR works manager at Crewe Works from 1843 to 1853.

Lungzubel

Lungzubel which means "Stone rice beer containers or jars" in the Biate language are stone relics found in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district in Assam and its surrounding areas extending to the neighboring state of Meghalaya.
Etymology.
Lungzubel means a rice beer jar or container in the Biate language. The literal meaning of Lungzubel are – 'Lung' means Stone, 'Zu' means Rice beer and 'Bel' means Jar, which comes together as “Stone Rice Beer Jar”.
History.
Lungzubels are one of the historical treasures of the Biate tribe. However, the origin of the Lungzubels remains shrouded in obscurity. According to Biate legends and elders, erection and carving of stone monuments has been the cultural practice of the Biate tribe from time immemorial, the most popular among them viz. the Lungzubels, Lungmaicham (stone altar), etc. These stone monuments or relics are generally a pictogram of a successful or triumphant Biate chief or warriors who gained honour in the past. Moreover, the fact that rice beer used to play an important role in the rituals and festivals of the Biates in the past throw much light on why the Lungzubels were carved out. One theory also holds that these stone jars are the handiwork of Lamlira, a legendary Biate warrior who led the Biates to their present hills believed to be in the 12-13th century.
Location.
Lungzubels are not confined to a particular place but are spread out in all Biate inhabited areas in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district and the adjoining state of Meghalaya across the Kangkalang (Kopili) river mainly in the Saipung Elaka, East Jaintia Hills district. Dr.B.Pakem, a renowned writer and former Vice-Chancellor of North Eastern Hill University also wrote that these round stones and hollow ground resemble those found in the nearby Sumer Elaka, between Umkyurpong and Kseh villages in Meghalaya. He believed that it might have been the sacrificial or dancing places of the Biates' forefathers in the past. In Dima Hasao, the most well-known location is a small Biate village called Khobak, about 130 km from the district headquarters Haflong. Lungzubels are also found in some other areas albeit in small numbers. It is widely believed that these places may also have been inhabited by the Biates in olden days.
Present condition and preservation.
Most of the relics were gradually destroyed over time, by nature or man, as it was left abandoned and unguarded for a long time. It is believed that the advent of Christianity among the Biates in the 19th century could have been the main reason behind the neglect of these cultural treasures as Christianity doesn't encourage intoxicated drinks of any kind. Originally animists, conversion to the new faith may have led the Biates to abandon their age old practice of brewing rice beer which is still a practice among some of their neighboring brethren tribes.
Encouragingly, because of the relentless efforts of the Biate Devanpui (Biate Apex Body) and the Biate Cultural Organization, Assam (BCOA), the importance of the relics and the need for its preservation have been acknowledged, and hence, as a result, Lungzubels around Khobak and its surrounding areas in Dima Hasao district are now being maintained and looked after by the Archaeological Dept. of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Assam. Moreover, with a view to promote tourism in the district as well as to showcase the Lungzubels to the world, Lungzubel festival was also organised by the Biate Cultural Organisation (BCO) of Assam, in collaboration with 22 Sector Assam Rifles, State Tourism Department and Archaeological Department and a Haflong-based NGO named Make a Difference (MaD) Society, on September 16, 2015 at Khobak where thousands of people from all spheres attended the day-long programme that included a pipe band display by the Assam Rifles and traditional dances performed by the local villagers belonging to the Biate community. The steps taken by the Assam Government has been commendable and the Lungzubels are now well looked after. Moreover, in the Assam Budget 2019-20, the Lungzubels at Khobak have been included in the list of eight important tourist/historical places of Dima Hasao district which will receive infrastructure upgradation grant as part of the "Asom Darshan" scheme launched by the Government of Assam as a tourism development initiative. This will go a long way in preserving and promoting the relics as well as in developing the areas around it. In the neighboring Meghalaya state, however, no concrete steps have been taken by the Government of Meghalaya to preserve the Lungzubels found in East Jaintia Hills district as of yet. They continue to be in a state of neglect.
Connectivity.
Khobak is well connected by an all weather motorable road and one can visit the place at any time of the year. It is located about 130 km from Haflong.

James B. Dozier

James Bell Dozier, also known as James Doshier, was born in Warren County, Tennessee on May 2, 1820, and died in 1901.
He is one of only eight civilian recipients of the Medal of Honor. As a civilian scout during the Indian Wars., he received the award "for gallantry in action and on the march." This occurred in 1870 at the Little Wichita River in Texas during a battle with the Keechi.
Revocation and reinstatement of the Medal of Honor.
In 1917, the U.S. Army—after Congress revised the standards for the award—removed from the rolls 911 medals previously awarded to civilians or for actions that would not warrant a Medal of Honor under the new higher standards. Dozier's medal was among those revoked. In 1977, Congress began reviewing numerous cases; it reinstated the medals for Dozier and four other civilian scouts on June 12, 1989.

400th Raider Infantry Battalion

The 400th Raider Infantry Battalion (Indonesian: "Yonif Raider 400/Banteng Raiders") is one of the 42 active Indonesian Army Raider Infantry Battalions. It was founded on 23 March 1953 and was transformed into its present form on Army Day, 22 December 2003 - one of the first generation Raider Battalions to be raised. The "Banteng Raiders" honorific honors the battalion being raised in response towards the threat posed by the Darul Islam's armed wing, the "Tentara Islam Indonesia", in its area of operations as part of Kodam IV/Diponegoro territorial command, and its origins date back to 1950. It also took part in the events following the 1965 30 September Movement, wherein infantrymen from the Battalion were operationally deployed to Jakarta. (Ironically, the leader of the movement. Lt Col Untung Syamsuri, was a former commanding officer with the battalion.)
The battalion today is stationed in Semarang in Central Java.
Brief history.
In January 1950, the Darul Islam movement was beginning to threaten the peace in Central Java, just weeks after the Netherlands government awarded all its colonial processions to the United States of Indonesia, ending centuries of Dutch rule. To deal with the grave military situation in the province, given the worsening health of the then Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Sudirman, the then Chief of Staff of the Army, Col Abdul Harris Nasution, through the commanding general of the then 4th Territorial Command Diponegoro, Col Gatot Soebroto, began the process of creating a commando formation to deal with the increasing presence of the DI's military arm the "Tentara Islam Indonesia" (Islamic Army of Indonesia). Thus was born what would be the basis of the 400th Raider Infantry Battalion - the "National Freedom Bull Operational Command" ("Komando Gerakan Banteng Negara"), under Lt Col as its first commanding officer, who the following year was succeeded by future Chief of Staff of the Army, then Col Ahmad Yani and assisted by Lt Col Bachrum. The "Banteng Raiders", the military part of that operation, were raised as two independent special forces companies and a training company beginning in February 1950 in Tegal, Central Java.
To complement the Raider Companies, by the time the then "454th Infantry Battalion Banteng Raiders" was officially raised on 23 March 1953, 4 more companies were formed:
The battalion's actions from 1954 to 1958 against TII detachments operating in Central Java led to the end of the DI/TII threat to the citizens of the province, leading to the 1954 death of , the provincial DI/TII commander.
In 1961, the battalion transitioned to being parachute infantry, the first infantry battalion to be designated in the airborne and air assault role in its military region AOR.
Transition to Raider Infantry.
It was no surprise that then Chief of Staff of the Army (and later Minister of Defense) GEN Ryamizard Ryacudu was the guest of honor in the 2003 Army Day parade in Jakarta when the battalion was, together with 10 other infantry battalions, presented new Colours as part of the formal introduction of the Raider Infantry specialty of the Army Infantry.
The battalion finished its transitional training in the new role in Cilacap in the spring of 2003. That Army Day parade was the first of the battalion in this new role as a special operations and commando-ready battalion of the Army infantry. It was a proud moment of the very battalion founded by national hero-martyr General Yani, whose innovative way in which the battalion was organized and equipped for - guerilla warfare and non-conventional operations against domestic and international threats - made this battalion the pioneer amongst the first 11 Raider Infantry battalions of the modern day Indonesian Army. Having marked earlier that year it's Golden Jubilee in March, it was a fitting finale to a year of celebrations of 50 years of service.

Ulmus glabra 'Nitida'

The wych elm cultivar Ulmus glabra 'Nitida' [:'shining', an allusion to the smooth upper surface of the leaves], the smooth glossy-leaved wych, was described by Fries from specimens collected by P. C. Afzelius in 1841 on the island of Stora Karlsö, Sweden, as "Ulmus montana nitida", in "Novitiae Florae Suecicae: continuatio, sistens Mantissam" III: 20 (1842). The "Novitiae Florae Gotlandicae" (1844) confirmed "U. montana" f. "nitida" as present on the islands of Stora Karlsö and neighbouring Lilla Karlsö off Gotland, Sweden, but did not report it from Gotland proper. A Stora Karlsö specimen from the Herbarium E. Fries is preserved in the Botanical Museum of Uppsala. The tree was listed by Rehder as "U. glabra" f. "nitida" (1915), a designation adopted by Krüssmann (1984), the latter copying Rehder's 'Norway' provenance error. 
A smooth-leaved wych occasionally appeared in collections outside Scandinavia. Syme in "English Botany; or, Coloured Figures of British Plants. Volume VIII" (1868) included an "U. montana" var. "nitida".
"U. minor" is present on Gotland, leaving open the possibility that Fries's "Ulmus montana nitida" was not pure wych. 
Description.
Krüssmann described f. "nitida" as having "leaves smooth above" and glabrous young shoots. An 1895 herbarium specimen from Lilla Karlsö shows a typical wych leaf with a short petiole, and a samara with seed on stalk side of centre, a feature of unhybridised wych. 
Sowerby described var. "nitida" as having "all the essential characteristics of "U. montana"" [wych elm] but with leaves "shining and glabrous above". Ley (1910) noted that in the Kew specimen the samara was "rounder at the point than in the type", with the "notch distinct, its basal angle acute, reaching more than one-fifth [of the] way to [the] seed cavity". 
Pests and diseases.
See under wych elm.
Cultivation.
The tree was planted in the streets of Skanör, Sweden, in the 19th century. 'Nitida' was described by Rehder (1915) as a form present in Norway (probably an error for Sweden) "and perhaps also in England". It was cultivated at Kew in the early 20th century as "Ulmus scabra (glabra)", the smooth-leaved wych, where it was described by Ley (1910), who had not seen it growing naturally in England. He later, however, prepared a herbarium specimen of a similar wych elm from Edmondsham, Dorset. Elwes and Henry do not mention the Kew specimen in their 1913 work.

Arcadea

Arcadea is an American synth-metal band from Atlanta, formed in 2015 by Mastodon drummer Brann Dailor, Zruda guitarist Core Atoms, and guitarist Raheem Amlani. Arcadea's self-titled album was released in June 2017 via Relapse Records.
History.
Arcadea was founded in 2015, by upside-down guitarist Core Atoms and drummer Brann Dailor in Atlanta, Georgia. With the addition of guitarist Raheem Amlani, the three-piece began recording tracks at Amlani's Orange Peel Studios in Atlanta in 2015. The result was an 11-song album which was released on Relapse Records on June 16, 2017. Arcadea is the second music collaboration between Rochester, New York natives Atoms and Dailor who played in the progressive funk trio Gaylord, in the late 1990s. 
The song "Through the Eye of Pisces" from the album was featured on an ident for the British free-to-air TV channel E4 titled "Cult", which first aired in October 2018 and was created by British sci-fi artist Essy May from the production company Funtasy who also made the artwork for the band's debut album.
Musical style and influences.
For all three band members, Arcadea was a departure from previous music projects in both concept and sound. While Atoms is known for his unique guitar playing style, Arcadea's premier album features no guitars—both Atoms and Amlani play only keyboards and synthesizers. For Dailor, it was an opportunity to sing lead vocals on the majority of songs in addition to drums. In an interview for Prog-Sphere Atoms explains, "Since we all have our own bands with more traditional instrumentation, we wanted to do something different but still rooted in our love of prog."
Both Dailor and Atoms credit Stevie Wonder, early Genesis, and other 70s progressive rock as influences for Arcadea.

Biography.
Early life and education.
Marnie Oursler was born outside of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County, Maryland into a family of homebuilders. The tradition began with her great-great grandfather and has been passed down through five successive generations. Her father, Marvin Oursler, owns Marrick Homes in Prince Frederick, Maryland.

Career.
Oursler bought her first house at the age of 24 in Bethany Beach, Delaware for $240,000 - costing her all of her savings.

Nine months later, she sold the house for $340,000, using the profits to build another beach house. After living in that house for two years, Oursler sold it and built a third house.
Realizing her talent and passion for the homebuilding business, Oursler began tracking real estate patterns in 2007.

It is very important to mention that PID carried on its work even during the days of the liberation war of 1971.
Just after the Liberation War, Regional Information Office of the then Provincial East Pakistan Government was reorganized as the present Press Information Department. Later, in 1984 following the advice of Enam Committee, the Research and Information preservation Departments again merged with the Press Information Department.
PID plays the nucleus role in disseminating information through press and media coverage for the people of national and international level to inform government's activity, policy - decision, development plan etc. in the form of handout distributed to the press and electronic media for having coverage as the main source of government. At the same time it functions as the two way traffic like letting people know about government's activity and getting the feedback of the mass and reaching it to the government. PID helps creating awareness among them. This department is considered as one of the most sensitive Government organizations.
PID works every day from the early morning to the midnight as news-flow never stops for a single bit of moment around the world. PID even remains open during all the national and government holidays and carries on its regular work and time schedule with its three main sections, sub sections and cell. The three main sections are Press, Administration, Protocol and Monitoring. The subsections are Research and Reference (R&amp;R) and Facts and Personalities (F&amp;P), Administration, Accreditation, Press Trend and News Brief, Coordination, Press Clippings, Press, newsroom, Photo and Feature etc. 
Three Regional Offices of PID in Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi are running for field level activities. Another four Regional Offices of PID in Barishal, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh got approval to in 2020 and those field level offices have started to function. 
The top position of PID is the Principal Information Officer (PIO) who is equivalent at the rank of Secretary (Grade-1) of Bangladesh Government. Two Additional Principal Information Officer (APIO)s assist the Principal Information Officer in all respects at the work and responsibility of PIO. For public relations and ministerial publicity of different ministries/divisions, PID attaches its personnel (member of Bangladesh Civil Service Information cadre) there. PID also attaches its officers and photographers to the Prime Minister's office, President's office, National Parliament and other relevant offices for Press and media liaison.

Vishwanath Datta

Vishwanath Datta (1835 — 25 February 1884) was a Bengali Attorney at law, philanthropist and novelist. He was the father of Swami Vivekananda, Mahendranath Dutta and Bhupendranath Dutta.
Early life.
Vishwanath was born in an aristocratic Hindu family of North Kolkata. His father Durgaprasad (1816—1850/55) preferred "Sannyas" life and left home when Vishwanath was six years old only. There is an interesting incident when he longed to return to Calcutta after five years of wandering for sanyass which Swami Vivekananda used to listen in his childhood. It happened so that, in somewhere between 1845 or 1846 Durgaprasad returned to Calcutta, He was recognised by one of his neighbours who locked him in a tiny room in his house so he cannot escape and remain in a starving condition as Sanyassi. He was locked in this room for 3 days. At last, on the third day the neighbour's wife Sarita Devi took pity on him and helped him escape from the house. Later Vishwanath was brought up by his uncle. He entered in Gourmohan Addy's school or Oriental Seminary. After completion of graduation in 1859 Datta worked as a clerk under an attorney, Charles Peter.
Career.
Datta was an enlightened person of the 18th century, free from religious superstitions, known for his charity and liberal outlook. He was well versed in Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, Arabic and Urdu languages. 
He married Bhuvaneswari Devi in 1851 and had nine children. Narendranath Dutta, his sixth child and second son, who later became famous as Swami Vivekananda, was born in 1863. 
In 1866 he applied for the post of proctor to Sir Barnes Peacock, the first Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court. His prayer was approved by Justice Walter Morgan (judge). Datta also maintained a law firm in Kolkata named Dhar &amp; Datta. Later he faced serious economic troubles for frequent litigation and lawsuits among Datta family.
Literary works.
Datta wrote a Bengali autobiographical novel named "Sulochana" based on a joint family dispute. In 1882 the novel was first published in Kolkata (then "Calcutta").

Church of St. Martin, Borschemich

The Church of St. Martin () was a Roman Catholic church in the village of , Erkelenz in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It was built between 1906 and 1907 in the Gothic Revival style to designs of the architect . It took over the role from a medieval church which was located nearby, which was demolished upon completion of the new building.
The church was deconsecrated in 2014, and it was demolished in February 2016 as part of the destruction of the entire village of Borschemich in order to make way for the Garzweiler surface mine. A was built as its replacement in Neu-Borschemich between 2013 and 2015.
History.
The Church of St. Martin was built between 1906 and 1907 according to designs of the architect and under the direction of the contractor Max Sauer. It was blessed on 27 October 1907 by dean Hermann Josef Kamp from Erkelenz, on behalf of the Archbishop of Cologne, Anton Hubert Fischer. The church was consecrated in honour of Saint Martin of Tours on 9 October 1915 by the auxiliary bishop .
The building took over the role of an earlier church, which was originally built in the 12th century, and was rebuilt in 1451 and renamed, extended and reconstructed in 1784. By the 19th century, the old church was insufficient, and it was demolished after the completion of the new church building
The church was built out of brick, and it had a single aisle with three bays in the nave, behind which was a triumphal arch and a choir. It had arched groin vaults. The three-storey bell tower was high, and it stood at the southern corner of the church. The building had a capacity of 150 people seated and 100 standing.
The church suffered some damage in 1945 during World War II, but it was repaired in 1950. A comprehensive renovation of both the exterior and interior was undertaken in 1982.
Deconsecration and demolition.
The village of Borschemich was on the planned route for the extension of the Garzweiler surface mine, a large lignite mine operated by the company RWE. The entire village was therefore demolished in the 2010s, with the company building a new settlement known as Neu-Borschemich as its replacement. RWE purchased the Church of St. Martin in 2013, and it was deconsecrated on 23 November 2014. The village's other major landmark, the , was demolished in 2015. Demolition of the church began at 10:00 am on 15 February 2016. The sacristy was demolished first, followed by the sanctuary. The tower was demolished a few days later.

 is an asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Apollo group, with an estimated diameter of . It was first observed on 9 February 2018, by astronomers of the Catalina Sky Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona, during its close approach to Earth.
Orbit and classification.
 is an Apollo asteroid. Apollo's cross the orbit of Earth and are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.92–1.34 AU once every 14 months (438 days; semi-major axis of 1.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic. It is, however, not a Mars-crossing asteroid, as its aphelion of 1.34 AU is less than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins its first observation at Mount Lemmon in February 2018.
Close approaches.
The object has a minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , which corresponds to 17.6 lunar distances (LD). On 14 February 2018, 14:44 UTC, it came within 18.66 LD of the Earth "(see diagrams)". Its next close approach will be on 14 February 2024, at a similar distance.
Physical characteristics.
The Minor Planet Center estimates a diameter of 59–190 meters. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures between 100 and 190 meters in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 22.33, and an assumed albedo between 0.057 and 0.20, which represent typical values for carbonaceous and stony asteroids, respectively.
As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

<doc id="56567770" url="?curid=56567770" title="Abietinella abietina">
Abietinella abietina

Abietinella abietina is a species of moss of the genus "Abietinella" in the family Thuidiaceae. It is a small, distinctive pleurocarpuous moss with stems that are erect and branches which are spreading, reminiscent of a tiny conifer. It’s extremely rare variety abietina is grown with the commoner var. hystricosa on coastal sand dunes. Abietinella abietina is a species which is perennial in terms of growing season, which means it can be found during all months of the year.
Characteristics.
"Abietinella abietina" shoots are of either green or dark brown. The tips of the shoots are usually yellow or green. The shoots are once-pinnate which have branches in four rows (arranged with two on each side of the stem) in two planes. Secondary stems are the length of about 5–10 cm. The leaves of the stems of "Abientinella abietina" are broad and oval shaped. They are longitudinally ridged and have a broad base. The leaves of the branch are smaller compared to the leaves of the stem which are bigger.
"Abietinella abietina" has the ability to grow stems which are about 2–8 cm in length (but rarely ever 12 cm). Branches arise in four ranks from these stems. The branches are often spread out at wide angles which result in sparse branches. The leaves of "Abietinella abietina" are broadly ovate, patent, and they pilcate at the base and they also taper to a long acuminate apex. The leaves of the branches are rather concave and broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a rather shorter apex.
Habitat.
"Abietinella abietina" favor soils which are shallow mostly in unimproved grassland which overlies calcareous sandy soil, dune slacks, and banks in quarries. It is known to hardly ever occur on base-rich slopes or rocky ledges in mountains. It would be extremely rare if found.
Similar species.
A similar plant is "Thiudium tamarscinum", which is 'tripinnate'; it consists of pinnately compound leaves arranged in a single plane. Because of this, it has a feathery look, more so then "A. aaietina".

Boeddeker Park

Boeddeker Park, more formally known as Father Alfred E. Boeddeker Park, is an urban park in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. This 1-acre park was renovated and reopened in 2014, especially intended to serve the needs of people in the surrounding neighborhood who experience amongst the highest levels of poverty in the city. The park was completed with a large mural, Everyone Deserves a Home, on the building above the park in 2016.
History.
The park was named after Father Alfred E. Boeddeker, a Franciscan friar who served the Tenderloin community for over forty years and founded the St. Anthony Dining Room to serve food for the poor and needy of the area. The park originally opened in 1985, and quickly became emblematic of urban decay with a lack of safe playground space for children and the growth public drug sales. Though the area of the Tenderloin was generally diverse, the park became associated with violence and danger, causing the diversity to stay away as it increasingly became associated with drugs and crime. The park was later infused with a $9 million renovation and reopened in 2014. 
Features.
The park includes an outdoor park with large lawn, adult exercise area with outdoor fitness equipment, a basketball court, youth play equipment, a walking path with accessible ramps. The park also has a clubhouse with a multipurpose room, office, and restrooms. 
Recognition and awards.
Boeddeker Park won an American Institute of Architects San Francisco Honor Award for its design, a collaboration between The Trust for Public Land, the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, and WRNS Studio. It is certified by the Sustainable SITES Initiative for its park sustainability systems.

Kėdainiai Hospital

Kėdainiai Hospital is one of the oldest hospitals in the region, providing general inpatient, outpatient, rehabilitation, medical nursing and support services for the residents of Kėdainiai district in Lithuania.
History.
The first hospital in Kėdainiai was established in 1888 with an appointment of Ivanas Eustachovskis as the chief medical doctor. The hospital had 10 beds and was located in a rented house on Didžioji street. The initial tenancy agreement has been concluded for three years, then extended to 12 years at an annual rental fee of 300 rubles.
In 1897 the hospital was relocated to its own wooden building donated by Victoria Totleben in memory of her late husband general Eduard Totleben. Later, the same Victoria Totleben commissioned to build a new hospital built of brick, which opened in 1900 and was named Kėdainiai Eduard Totleben Village Hospital (today the building is occupied by a local Labour Exchange office). The hospital had 40 beds and its own electricity generator, as Kedainiai did not have a constant power supply at the time.
In 1937, now under the local government's initiative, a new 75-bed hospital worth 330,000 litas was built nearby and named the Hospital Palace. However, the joy was short-lived as it was demolished by retreating Nazi army in 1944. Rescued equipment was moved to the Village Hospital, which again served the main hospital's function.
Due to the shortage of beds and poor working conditions, the local government has repeatedly called the Lithuanian Ministers'
council asking for funds to rebuild the demolished hospital. Eventually, in 1965 a new 240-bed hospital was built in the new location where it remains today.

John Murray (abolitionist)

John Murray (1787–1849) was an abolitionist and social activist who served as Corresponding Secretary of the Glasgow Emancipation Society.
Early life.
Born in England, probably at Portsea where he was baptised in May 1787, he was orphaned at an early age and brought up by paternal relatives in Caithness who provided him with ‘that excellent educational and religious training which is given to the children of the middle and higher classes in Scotland’. Following a pulmonary haemorrhage in his early twenties, he went to the West Indies and found employment as a millwright at St Kitts. He remained there for several years, became acquainted with Dr. William Stephen, a brother of William Wilberforce’s legal adviser James Stephen, and joined with him in protesting the mistreatment of slaves on the island. When Murray later laboured in the abolitionist cause, the Stephen connection fostered close co-operation between him and the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society led by George Stephen.
Abolitionist work.
While in the West Indies, Murray became committed to what historian Duncan Rice has called ‘organizational radicalism’. He was convinced that slaveholding and patronage ‘were forms of property ownership distorted to a point that made them the symbolic antithesis of vital Christianity’.
Returning to Scotland, he quickly identified himself with the abolitionist and other reform movements and became a member of the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society on its formation in 1822. When that Society ceased to meet, following the abolition of slavery in the British colonies, he called for the establishment of a new association to work for the suppression of slavery worldwide.
His appeals led to the Glasgow Emancipation Society being formed in December 1833 with the Quaker tea merchant William Smeal and himself as its executive officers. The two men became ‘the soul of the Society’ and their conduct of its affairs was largely autonomous. Its object was the global abolition of slavery, and the Society was able to build on a vibrant local tradition of both abolitionism and benevolence. Their administrative efficiency was evidenced in 1838 when more than 100,000 signatures were collected for the Society’s petition demanding an end to the ‘apprenticeship’ of freed slaves in the West Indies — a powerful response by the Empire’s second city to Lord Melbourne’s negative stance at a meeting with Murray and other Glasgow delegates a few months earlier.
In 1840 Murray was a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London; there his proposed scheme for protecting the African continent against slavery was tabled. Shortly afterward a schism occurred in the Glasgow Society and, as part of the reordering of its affairs, Murray was appointed Corresponding Secretary while Smeal became Minutes Secretary and Treasurer. In practice, Murray may always have led the conduct of the Society’s communications. He ‘used more than one ream of paper for manuscripts upon the great cause which he seemed born to carry out’, supplying information and argument to other abolitionist organisations, arranging speaking engagements, preparing addresses and resolutions, and bombarding political leaders at home and abroad with reasoned protests and carefully formulated proposals.
From its birth, the Glasgow Emancipation Society prioritized pressing for British support for the abolitionist struggle in America. Murray identified himself with William Lloyd Garrison’s demands for immediate and unconditional freedom of slaves; he read Garrison’s ‘Appeal to the Friends of Negro Emancipation throughout Great Britain’ (August 1833) to the assembly that resolved to form the Society and later established a warm personal rapport with Garrison and other leaders of the American abolitionist cause who visited Glasgow, often accommodating them at his home and pressing his own money on them for travel expenses. Charles Lenox Remond reported being nursed through several days of fever in ‘the truly hospitable house of my dear friend John Murray’.
Among others from the American movement on familiar terms with Murray was Frederick Douglass, who described him as ‘the firm, the untiring, the devoted friend of the slave’ and captured the force of Murray’s commitment when recalling the campaign for the Free Church of Scotland to return American slaveowners’ donations: ‘While he lived that Church obtained no repose.’
Other activism.
From 1841 onwards the Glasgow Emancipation Society became increasingly militant not only in the abolitionist interest but across a range of issues dear to its officers, including international peace, constitutional reform, and temperance. Murray was prominent in the Glasgow Anti-War Society, sat on the committee of the Glasgow Voluntary Society (committed to disestablishment of the Church), called for total abstinence, and was a delegate to the International Peace Congress at London in 1843 and Brussels in 1848.
On returning from the West Indies he had set up as a spirit merchant but, becoming convinced of the evil of strong liquor, he gave up the trade and donated his stock to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. When he declined to drink or serve fermented wine at the Lord’s Supper of Old Kilpatrick Relief Church, he was removed from his position as an elder of the Church; on his appealing against such removal, the Paisley Presbytery expelled him from membership of the Church, and when he carried the matter onward to the Synod his expulsion was confirmed.
Even as early as 1841 the wide-ranging radicalism of his views was observed by Nathaniel Peabody Rogers: ‘If there is a revolution in Scotland within twenty years, the name of John Murray will not be undistinguished in its history.’
Legacy.
Shortly after the death of the American statesman Henry Clay in 1852, James McCune Smith compared the legacy of Clay’s forty years at the heart of American public life with the enduring achievements of John Murray. In favour of the latter, he declared, ‘I cannot help thinking how much more has been done for the cause of human progress by this faithful servant to his own convictions of the truth.’
Service with Forth &amp; Clyde Canal Company.
Murray’s paternal family had intermarried with the influential Oswalds of Shieldhall, and he was able to engage the support of his kinsman James Oswald, MP for Glasgow, for some of the Emancipation Society’s initiatives. Oswald later became one of the Society’s Vice-Presidents, and he was also instrumental in obtaining employment for Murray with the Forth and Clyde Canal Company.
While an inspector of works for the Company in 1828, Murray recommended the navigational trials which ultimately led to the Canal being used by steam vessels, thereby overcoming the generally prevailing prejudice against such use and resulting in the Canal becoming the principal conduit for Glasgow-manufactured goods to the ports on the Firth of Forth. He was subsequently made Collector for the Company. This appointment brought with it the house at Bowling Bay which was visited by many transatlantic abolitionists.
Death and family.
Murray died at Bowling, after successive attacks of paralysis, on 26 March 1849. He left a widow, Anne, née Thomson (a committee member of the Glasgow Ladies’ Auxiliary Emancipation Society from its formation in 1834 until her death in 1850). The couple had two sons and a daughter. Each of the children was involved in their father’s work from an early age. The elder boy, James Oswald Murray (1823–70), contributed verses in support of the abolitionist cause to various publications, and arranged the printing of the French translation of Frederick Douglass’s "Narrative" in 1847, but was so impregnated with ‘the Garrison spirit’ that Elihu Burritt had to abandon plans to involve him in his peace campaign. James Oswald Murray was also an able artist whose portraits included that of his father, drawn at Bowling in April 1848.

San Gaggio, Florence

The Church of San Gaggio () is a Roman Catholic church located on via Senese in Florence, Italy. It was once associated with a large convent.
An early church at the site was associated with the Patarines, and demolished by the followers of St Peter Martyr. Under the patronage of Donna Nera Manieri and the Corsini family, a church at the site was founded in the mid-14th century and dedicated to St Catherine "delle Ruote". In 1353, it was joined to an adjacent monastery of "Santa Caterina a Monte", and dedicated to "San Cajo" (Saint and Pope Caius). The name was corrupted to "San Gaggio". The church was subsequently heavily patronized by the Corsini family.
Interior.
The interior has a chapel of St Andrea Corsini (1603), frescoed by the studio of Bernardino Poccetti and housing an "Annunciation with Saints" by the studio of Francesco Brina. The main altar was designed by Cigoli, who painted the oval fresco of the "Mystical Marriage of St Catherine" and the "Dispute of St Catherine". The 14th-century funeral monuments of the Corsini family, including Bartolommeo and Filippo, were moved to a chapel in the cloister of the church of Santo Spirito.

<doc id="56568283" url="?curid=56568283" title="Edmond Lepelletier">
Edmond Lepelletier

Edmond Lepelletier (26 June 1846 – 22 July 1913) was a French journalist, a prolific popular novelist and a politician.
He is known for his lifelong friendship with Paul Verlaine.
He was initially a radical, fought for the Paris Commune, and wrote for republican journals.
Later he abandoned his friends and became nationalist and antisemitic.
Early years.
Lepelletier was born on 26 June 1846 in Paris.
He was born in the Monceau district of Batignolles.
He received a classical education at the Lycée Bonaparte (now the Lycée Condorcet), then enrolled in the Faculty of Law, where he gained a Bachelor's degree.
He never pleaded as a lawyer, and later became a publicist.
He married, and was the father of the playwright Saint-Georges de Bouhélier and of the wife of René Viviani.
He fought 17 duels, was wounded, and only retained his limbs thanks to the surgeon Jules-Émile Péan.
He defended the surgeon obstinately when he was viciously attacked by the press.
Toward the end of the Second French Empire Lepelletier was condemned for attacks on Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine.
In the Sainte-Pélagie Prison he met Louis Charles Delescluze, later military commander of the Paris Commune, the writer Jules Vallès, Raoul Rigault and other future supporters of the Commune.
In 1867 he became a political journalist, writing in the "Nain Jaune" of Paris.
He contributed to the "Peuple souverain", "Suffrage universel", "Patriote français", "Rappel à l'homme libre", "Droits de l'homme", "Radical", "Marseillaise", "Mot d'ordre" and finally to "L'Écho de Paris".
Lepelletier became known for his novels, mainly drawn from dramatic works, including "Le Capitaine Angot" (1875), "Le chien du commissaire" (1876), "Ivan le nihiliste" (1880), "L'Amant de cœur" (1884) and "Laï-tou" (1885).
They were written with the same brisk, colorful style that was found in his political articles.
Radical.
During the Franco-Prussian War (1870) Lepelletier enlisted in the 69th line regiment, then joined the 110th, and took part in the defense of Paris with his regiment.
He was a delegate to the Council of State of the Paris Commune.
For this, he was arrested after the Commune was repressed and held in preventative detention for a long time before being sentenced to one month's imprisonment.
He wrote later in his history of the Commune, "An idea germinated in the blood-soaked fields of Paris: Paris was to be free and autonomous, it was to practice the dictatorship of example, to serve as model for cities, provinces, states and kingdoms. Paris as a focal point of democracy and the center of social progress was, first of all, to become the capital of the united states of Europe and then to be the Rome of a universal federation of nations."
Lepelletier was a friend of Verlaine until his death, and wrote his biography.
Lepelletier recalled that Paul Verlaine (1844–96) was infatuated with Arthur Rimbaud, a very affected young man, and imposed him on all his friends.
In 1871, the day after Verlaine and Rimbaud had flaunted their relationship in the Odéon Theatre lobby, Lepelletier wrote in his gossip column that, "Paul Verlaine was arm-in-arm with a charming young lady, Mlle. Rimbaut."
At dinner a few days later Rimbaut threatened Lepelletier with a steak knife.
Lepelletier wrote that he threw the boy back into his chair, saying that in the recent war he had not been afraid of Prussians, and now he was not going to be bothered by a little troublemaker like Rimbaud.
He thought Verlaine's addiction to absinthe "undermined his moral and cerebral stamina, and eventually led to his social and even intellectual downfall."
He helped Verlaine in his last moments, and took care of his family.
Le Pelletier held very radical views, but they moderated when he began writing for "l'Echo de Paris".
For many years he was an active propagandist of Freemasonry, and held a high rank in this movement. 
In January 1882 he founded a Freemasons lodge, Les Droits de l'homme (Human Rights).
This quickly became one of the most brilliant and active lodges in the Grand Orient de France.
In 1888 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour.
During a meeting of the Cirque d'Hiver in 1889 he laid the foundations for the great Republican Union movement that defeated Boulangism.
In the legislative elections of 4 October 1889 the Blanquists and Boulangists cooperated, dividing the electoral districts of Paris between the two parties.
Lepelletier ran as Republican candidate for the Seine for the 2nd constituency of the 17th arrondissement of Paris but was defeated in the first round by the Blanquist Ernest Roche, who won 8,953 votes against 7,758 for Lepelletier.
He was an anti-revoluationary candidate again in 1893 in the 2nd constituency of the 17th arondissement of Paris.
He was again defeated by Ernest Roche.
He was appointed a justice of the peace for the canton of Marly in 1889, but was dismissed in 1899.
Nationalist.
In 1898 Lepelletier completely abandoned the Republican majority to join the Nationalists.
In 1899 he was President of the International Congress of the Press in Rome.
He resigned from Freemasonry, left his political friends and ran successfully in the 1900 Paris municipal election for the Batignolles district as an antisemitic candidate. 
As an editor at "l'Echo de Paris" he strongly opposed review of the Dreyfus trial.

Thomas Worsley Staniforth

Thomas Worsley Staniforth (7 June 1845 – 25 March 1909) was a British hymn writer.
Life.
Thomas was born in Sheffield, England to Thomas Staniforth, a Grinder and Cordelia Worsley. His family lived in the Wicker area of the city. Prior to becoming interested in music, Thomas worked as an Accounting clerk. By the time of the 1871 Census he had relocated to Brighton and is described as an Organist. Thomas primarily worked at St Paul's Church, Brighton as Organist and Choirmaster and later moved onto a position as music master at Highgate School in London.
On 27 February 1872 his hymn "O Thou Our Souls" was chosen to be performed at St. Paul's Cathedral during a thanksgiving service for the recover of then Prince of Wales Edward VII. Other notable hymns composed by Staniforth include "Jerusalem my happy home" and "St Paul" He was also a regular contributor to the Sheffield Telegraph for whom he wrote articles on church history and music.
Towards the end of the century he retired back to Sheffield. On 5 October 1898 he married Sarah Susannah Nicholson (Denton), a widower at the Wicker Parish church. He died on 25 March 1909 and was buried on 29 March 1909 at City Road Cemetery.

Legacy sediment

Legacy sediment (LS) is depositional bodies of sediment inherited from the increase of human activities since the Neolithic. These include a broad range of land use and land cover changes, such as agricultural clearance, lumbering and clearance of native vegetation, mining, road building, urbanization, as well as alterations brought to river systems in the form of dams and other engineering structures meant to control and regulate natural fluvial processes (erosion, deposition, lateral migration, meandering). The concept of LS is used in geomorphology, ecology, as well as in water quality and toxicological studies.
LS is distributed in spatially heterogeneous ways throughout a landscape and accumulates to form various landforms. It can progress through the fluvial system through facies changes from hillslope colluvium, to floodplain and wetland alluvium, to fine-grained lacustrine and estuarine slackwater deposits. The temporal nature of LS is time-transgressive, meaning that initiation and peak rates of deposition can take place at different times within a fluvial system, as well as at different times between regions. The intermittent transport of LS can be thought of as a cascading system that reworks LS deposits from hillslopes, into channels and onto floodplains, such that anthropogenic sediment will be mixed with and non-anthropogenic sediment.
River systems record past and present imprints of anthropogenically-forced changes to the environment. LS is an element of change in this context, as it drives fluxes of energy and matter (connectivity) through fluvial systems and provides indication of past land-uses and river dynamics that can inform future trajectories of river response. In this sense, acknowledging the concept of LS can benefit informed policy development in stream restorationn, water quality and sediment budget management, protection of aquatic ecosystems, and flood risk. Moreover, the implications of legacy effects associated with anthropogenically modified sediment dynamics are critical in the context of ecosystem services.
Definitions.
Post-settlement alluvium.
Definitions predominantly indicate post-settlement alluvium in North America created as a result of agricultural clearance. “Legacy Sediment (n.) Sediment that (1) was eroded from upland slopes during several centuries of intensive land clearing, agriculture, and milling (in the eastern U.S., this occurred from the late 17th to late 19th Centuries); (2) collected along stream corridors and valley bottoms, burying pre-settlement streams, floodplains, wetlands, and dry valleys; and that altered the hydrologic, biologic, aquatic, riparian, and chemical functions of pre-settlement streams and floodplains; (3) accumulated behind ubiquitous low-head mill dams in slackwater environments, resulting in thick accumulations of fine-grained sediment, which distinguishes ‘‘legacy sediment’’ from fluvial deposits associated with meandering streams; (4) can also accumulate as coarser grained, more poorly sorted colluvial (not associated with stream transport) deposits, usually at valley margins; (5) can contain varying amounts of total phosphorus and nitrogen, which contribute to nutrient loads in downstream waterways from bank erosion processes. . .’’ 
Anthropogenically-caused episodic sedimentary deposits.
As a result of criticism related to the limited scope and applicability of this definition, a more flexible and generic definition has been proposed that (1) includes a broader range of human activities, (2) considers more sediment types apart from post-settlement alluvium, and (3) respects the spatial (nonuniform) and temporal (time-transgressive) variability of LS: 
Types and related landforms.
Types.
LS encompasses sediment of differing structures and textures. They can be colluvial, containing poorly sorted, angular rock fragments deposited by mass wasting or sheet erosional processes, alluvial, containing well sorted, rounded clasts and very-fine grained suspended sediment deposited by fluvial processes.
Associated landforms.
Most LS is generated on highlands by erosional processes related to mass-wasting, sheet flow, rills and gullies. The deposited colluvium has a low travel distance and accumulates in midslope drapes near the site of erosion, in aprons or sediment wedges at the base of the slope or in fans at the mouth of gullies, debris flows and tributaries.
Floodplains store alluvium through lateral and vertical accretion, i.e. bedload deposits are being incorporated into the floodplain. Depositional episodes reflect the balance between the amount of sediments available and the capacity for it to be transported. Accordingly, the nature of LS on floodplains can be of different nature: (1) graded, when an excess of sediment and a deficit in transport capacity buries floodplains in continuous deposits, (2) cascading, when abundant sediment and limited transport capacity results in a series of frequent, but separated pockets, (3) punctuated, when limited sediment supply but efficient transport leads to deposition only in locally isolated pockets.
In low energy environments like lakes, wetlands, estuaries, LS are dominated by very fine-grained material, such as silts and clays, and form beaches and beach-dune complexes.
Source to sink relationships.
Another way to conceptualize the spatial pattern of LS throughout a watershed is through the notion of source and storage or sink zones. Stores differentiate themselves from sinks through their temporal persistence in the landscape, the first being temporary, while the second are more long-lasting. Highlands are characterized by local storage points near the sediment production zone, with larger storage spaces downstream in wider valleys with low gradients. Stores in this parts of a watershed have generally low residence times, as they are episodically reworked by the fluvial system. Sources are linked to sinks through transport or transfer zones, generally characterized by either high transport capacity or little accommodation space for sediment to accumulate in, e.g. steep narrow valleys that are highly effective in transferring sediment downstream. Sinks are most common in low-lying, low gradient areas where flow energy is dissipated across large surfaces, so that accumulation is dominant. Here, storage space and residence time of the deposits increases considerably relative to upstream parts of a watershed.
Legacy effects.
Scientific studies documenting the widespread alteration of sediment dynamics (i.e. sediment supply, sediment entrainment, transport, erosion, deposition and storage) by humans lead to the evidence that human activities have come to dominate erosional, depositional and geochemical processes in ecosystems. This is especially pronounced in river systems, given that rivers are the lowest topographic points of any landscape and consequently collect water, solutes, mineral sediment and particular organic matter from the landscape, but also precipitation, solutes and particulates from the atmosphere. Furthermore, increased sediment supply to rivers but reduced sediment transport within a fluvial network resulted in the creation of legacy effects along almost all rivers across the world. For example, even though accelerated anthropogenic soil erosion has increased sediment transport of rivers across the globe by 2.3 (± 0.6) billion metric tons per year, sediment delivery to the world's coasts and oceans has been reduced by 1.4 (± 0.3) billion metric tons per year because of retention within reservoirs. More than 50% of the major watersheds over the world are impacted by dams. In the United States alone, it is estimated that only 2% of river kilometers are not affected by dams.
Human activities lead to legacy effects on river sediments, which manifest themselves as changes to the location, amount and composition of sediments. Legacy effects are temporally and spatially variable and the resulting sediment have varying spatial extents, accumulation rates and residence times within a river system. For example, removal of beaver dams may initially cause local sedimentation within a portion of basin that comprises solely a few hectares. Similarly, one milldam constructed within a river enhances deposition of sediment over several hectares. Conversely, construction of hundreds of kilometers of bank revetment structures, such as levees, has a much more extensive impact across a basin of nearly eliminating overbank sedimentation. Likewise, removal of native vegetation within an upland region of a basin may lead to significant aggradation of valley bottoms along almost the entire course of a river network. Wastewater treatment can remove contaminated sediment within less than a year, but heavy metals and synthetic chemicals may remain within river sediments at toxic standards for decades to centuries.
Three main effects of anthropogenic manipulation of ecosystems are to enhance sedimentation, to reduce or eliminate sedimentation and/or to contaminate sediments with various pollutants.
Enhanced sedimentation.
Sedimentation is enhanced by activities that either increase sediment supply to the river from upstream (e.g. agricultural clearing, mining, grazing) or other parts of the watershed or decrease the transport capacity of the river (e.g. flow regulation).
The effects thereof may induce river metamorphosis, i.e. a whole-shift alteration of river morphology. For example, changing crops from grains to potatoes in late 19th century Poland resulted in such increased sediment yields, that meandering rivers metamorphosed into braided rivers. Copper mining in the headwaters of the Ok Tedi River in Papua New Guinea generated about 80 thousand tonnes per day of waste tailings and 121 thousand tonnes per day of mined wasted rock, which were discarded in the river and affected the entire course of the river network, as well as the nearshore environment. The river system responded by aggrading over 6 meters in parts of the basin a decade later. In California, the Bear River still continues to rework and move down sediment generated by mining activities more than a century after these stopped.
Indirectly, climate change can also enhance sedimentation through changes in precipitation and discharge patterns, which have been shown to result in increased mass movements, alterations of wildfire regimes and increased glacial melting.
Reduced sedimentation.
Sedimentation is reduced or removed altogether when human activities reduce sediment yields from upstream (e.g. dams and reservoirs within upland regions, sediment detention basins) or reduce the river channel's physical complexity (e.g. channelization, drainage) or disconnect river channels from adjacent floodplains and wetlands (e.g. levees, removal of beaver dams and logjams/large woody debris).
Rapid dam construction in the Mekong River system resulted in 38 dams (as of 2014) and an additional 133 proposed for the main stream and its tributary streams – if all of these were to be constructed, the overall sediment trapping capacity would be 96%. Estimates show that about 100 billion metric tons of sediment are presently stored in reservoirs that have been constructed over the past 50 years. Levee construction in the lower Mississippi River reduced overbank flows by 90%. Bank stabilization measures associated with this project reduced bank erosion and meander lateral migration, while dikes induced bed scour during low flows due to increased flow velocity. Overall, this project lead to a decrease of sediment storage on the floodplain from 89,600 to 7,000 square kilometers between 1882–2000. In Australia's Cann River, wood removal from the channel transformed downstream segments of the river network from a sediment sink to a sediment source.
Contaminated sedimentation.
Human activities introduce or concentrate naturally occurring (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) or synthetic contaminants and pollutants that get absorbed in sediments and may lead, at toxic levels, to chronic or severe disruption of physiologic mechanisms in all organisms. The most common contaminants that can absorb fine sediment are trace metals, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pathogens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
For instance, two tailing dams of gold mines located in Romanian tributaries of the Danube failed, thereby releasing vast amounts of cyanide-contaminated water and sediment for tens of kilometers downstream, which killed riverine organisms and affected human drinking-water supply for weeks. In the Rio San Juan basin of Peru, acid mine drainage was diverted into a natural lake, leading to extremely high concentrations copper, zinc and lead in the lake sediments. Samples taken by the USGS during 1993-2003 showed that median concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural streams are six times greater than background levels and that, across the US, concentrations in streams commonly lie above levels recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency in order to protect aquatic life.

Ignazio Florio Sr.

Ignazio Florio Sr. (Palermo, 16 December 1838 – Palermo, 17 May 1891) was an Italian entrepreneur and politician, member of the rich Florio economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.
Biography.
The son of Vincenzo Florio Sr., the founder of the economic family dynasty, and of Giulia Portalupi, Ignazio was born in Palermo on 17 December 1838. After the death of his father, in 1868, he resolved the problems of the division of the inheritance that could have meant the liquidation of the flourishing enterprise. 
The other heirs, his sisters Giuseppina and Angelina, were not interested in the family businesses and preferred the payment of their parts. This required cash outflows of over 4 million lire, corresponding to more than a third of the value of all assets. Ignazio succeeded in dealing with the financial effort without affecting the productive activities. Free from constraints, he set about to consolidate and further develop the business empire.
In 1874, Ignazio Florio Sr. purchased the island of Favignana and the whole archipelago of the Aegadian Islands in order to expand the tuna business started by his family. Over time he brought the flotilla of the paternal shipping line "Societa in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio &amp; Vicenzo Florio" (Florio Line) to a hundred units and in 1881 merged with the Rubattino company in Genoa, giving rise to the Navigazione Generale Italiana. At the time of the merger, the Florio Line was already a major company with a monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean. "The New York Times" described the Florios as the "merchant princes of Europe". The Florio Line brought 50 ships into the merger, while Rubattino contributed 40.
He also considerably developed all the other industries founded by his father. In 1883 he was appointed Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, due to the fact that he had paid three thousand lire of direct taxation for three years because of his assets or industry. At his death in 1891 Ignazio Sr. left his two sons, Ignazio Florio Jr. and Vincenzo Florio, with assets valued at around 100 million lire.
Issue.
Ignazio Jr. and his wife – baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona – had three children:

Ecotive Metrocab

The Ecotive Metrocab (sometimes called New Metrocab), first presented in December 2013, is a purpose-built electrically powered hackney carriage manufactured by Ecotive, a subsidiary of Kamkorp. The vehicle is designed to comply with Transport for London’s taxi regulations, which, from 1 January 2018, ban new diesel-powered taxis and require zero-emissions capability.
The vehicle is electrically powered and has a 1.0-litre petrol engine to extend its range. It is the first authorised electric-powered London black cab. In March 2014 several vehicles were lent to taxi drivers for evaluation.
The Metrocab’s main competitor is the LEVC TX, another completely new electric taxi built to London’s 2018 regulations, and successor to the well-known TX4.
Manufacturing.
Prototypes were shown to the press in January 2014 and a “small fleet” of vehicles were running with the taxi operator ComCab in early 2015.
In May 2015 it was announced that, following a £50,000,000 investment, 3,500 Metrocab vehicles per year will be manufactured by Multimatic at an expanded plant in Tile Hill, Coventry.
Technical specifications.
The manufacturer claims fuel economy of 98 mpg (2.88 L/100 km) on the ECE101 cycle, a range of over 348 miles (560 km), emissions of less than 65g/km CO2 per km. It has regenerative braking and can be recharged from a mains electric outlet, as well as by its own petrol engine. It has a turning circle of 25 feet (London taxi regulations specify a maximum turning circle of 25 ft or 7.62 m). It has six passenger seats, with an optional 7th passenger seat in the front. Top speed is restricted to 80 mph. The lithium-ion polymer large format cells have a stored capacity of 12.2kWh.
Peak motor power is 2 x 50 kW. Peak wheel torque is 2 x 1,400Nm.
Trademark challenge.
By 2015 London Taxi Company (LTC, now London EV Company), makers of the long-running TX4 taxi, were planning their own electric taxi, the TX5. In June 2015 LTC sued the makers of the Metrocab, claiming breach of trademark. A lawyer for LTC was quoted in the press as saying “It is actually all about the shape”.
In his January 2016 judgement, Mr Justice Arnold rejected all of LTC’s claims. He considered that “both LTC’s registered trade marks, which depict models of its taxis, were invalid and that even if LTC’s trade marks had been valid, they would not be infringed by the new Metrocab due to the low degree of similarity between the Metrocab and the LTC taxi”.
In November 2017 the judgement was confirmed at the Court of Appeal. A Metrocab spokesman said: “It is a great pity that unnecessary time has been wasted on a false accusation … We have continued to trial, improve and develop our technology over the last three years with taxi drivers in active service and are extremely proud of our decision to design and develop the entirety of the Metrocab here in the UK. We are looking forward to getting production up and running in Coventry following the court’s decision.”

Idaikaadar (Tamil: இடைக்காடர்) was a Tamil siddhar of the Sangam period. He authored verse 54 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.
Biography.
Unlike Idaikaadanar of the Sangam period, who was a poet by profession, Idaikaadar was a siddhar. Idaikaadar hailed from Idaikattur near Madurai. He belongs to the Idaikkali country. He is known for composing poems with excellent exemplifications. He has written in praise of the Chola King Kulamuttratthu Thunjiya Killi Valavan (Purananuru verse 42). He has also authored the grammar text "Oosimuri".
He is believed to have attained jeeva samadhi at Thiruvannamalai. He hosted navagrahas during a famine. A small navagraha temple remains at the site today at Idaikattur.
Literary contributions.
Verse 54 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai, an encomium written on Valluvar and the Kural literature, is attributed to Idaikaadar. The verse suggests, "Valluvar pierced a mustard and injected seven seas into it and compressed it into what we have today as Kural." It can be noted that Avvaiyar I fortified the meaning of this verse by replacing the first word "mustard" with the word "atom." He is one of the two contributors of the Tiruvalluva Maalai who have penned the verse in the Kural venba metre, the other one being Avvaiyar I.

George and Alfred

"George and Alfred" is a short story by P. G. Wodehouse and a Mr. Mulliner story. It was published in "Playboy" magazine in the US in January 1967. The story was also included in the 1966 collection "Plum Pie".
An earlier version of the story featured Reggie Pepper and was published as "Rallying Round Old George" in "The Strand Magazine" in December 1912. An American edition of this story was published in "Collier's Weekly" on 27 September 1913, titled "Brother Alfred".
In "George and Alfred", Mr. Mulliner goes to Monte Carlo, along with his nephew George, who gets into trouble after getting drunk. To help George, Mr. Mulliner comes up with an idea that takes advantage of the fact that George has a twin brother, Alfred.
Plot.
At The Angler's Rest pub, the topic of twins arises, and Mr. Mulliner recounts the following story involving his nephews, the identical twins George and Alfred. Alfred is a magician in London professionally known as "The Great Alfredo", while George is a low-ranking scriptwriter in Hollywood, being essentially a yes-man to his boss Jacob Schnellenhamer. Mr. Mulliner befriends Schnellenhamer and sees George on Schnellenhamer's yacht heading to Monte Carlo. George is eager to collect an inheritance left to him by his godmother from his trustee, P. P. Bassinger, in Monaco.
At Monte Carlo, Mr. Mulliner is surprised to see Alfred, who is performing at the Casino. Mr. Mulliner tells Alfred that he is with the filmmaker Schnellenhamer. Alfred leaves for rehearsal before Mr. Mulliner can tell him that George has also come. Later, Schnellenhamer says that Sam Glutz, whom Schnellenhamer came to Monte Carlo to do business with, was mugged and knocked out near the Casino. He was found by a passer-by and taken to a hospital. Sergeant Brichoux of the Monaco police arrives, looking for George Mulliner. George's wallet was found near where Glutz was mugged. Concerned, Mr. Mulliner looks for George.
He finds George, who had been drinking because Bassinger gambled George's inheritance away and ran off to South America. George remarks that he dreamed he had brawled with someone. Mr. Mulliner concludes that George must have mugged Sam Glutz when drunk. He tells George to flee, but George's passport is on the yacht. George cannot get it while the police are around, and he says his uncle would never find it. George resigns himself to his fate, saying of life, "You can't win". Mr. Mulliner, hearing "twin", gets an idea: George will retrieve his passport pretending to be Alfred.
On the yacht, a man claiming to be Alfred shows up and pitches an idea to Schnellenhamer to include a magician in his next film. Mr. Mulliner realizes this is actually Alfred. Alfred goes further into the yacht to get materials to demonstrate his tricks, and then George appears, pretending to be Alfred. Sergeant Brichoux is about to arrest George when a bandaged man, Sam Glutz, approaches. Schnellenhamer tells him that they have the mugger, George, and that he has fired George. However, Sam reveals that George actually saved his life by fending off the mugger. Sam hires George and promises him a large salary. Sam, George and Mr. Mulliner leave to have lunch. Meanwhile, Alfred returns to demonstrate his tricks to Schnellenhamer.
Differences between editions.
There are many differences between the Mr. Mulliner and Reggie Pepper versions of the story. In the Reggie Pepper story, Reggie's friend George Lattaker kisses the maid Emma Pilbeam out of sheer joy when he gets engaged to Stella Vanderley, but Stella sees this and ends their engagement. (Voules, Reggie's valet, also ended his engagement to Emma after seeing George kiss her.) This induces George to drink, and he vaguely remembers getting into a brawl. Also, George is due to receive a legacy from his trustee, his uncle Augustus Arbutt, but is told that he must wait because a man is claiming to be George's long-lost twin brother Alfred.
The Prince of Saxburg-Liegnitz gets mugged near the Casino, and George is suspected. Reggie suggests that George pretend to be Alfred to avoid arrest. George discovers later that the uncle invented the twin brother to buy time to flee after gambling away George's money. Voules finds out about George pretending to be Alfred, and Reggie bribes him to remain silent. Count Fritz von Cöslin, the Prince's equerry, reveals that George saved the Prince's life. Voules suddenly appears, now wealthy and outspoken after a winning streak at the casino; seeking revenge on George for kissing Emma, he betrays George's identity, and is surprised when the Count wants to reward George. Voules reconciles with Emma. Reggie fires him, but Voules was planning to quit anyway.
The plots of the British and American editions of the Reggie Pepper story are essentially the same, though in the latter edition, Reggie Pepper and his friends are American rather than British. Reggie's valet Voules is still English; Reggie introduces him as "an Englishman who had spent most of his time valeting earls, and looked it".
Background.
The references to Hollywood in the Mulliner story "George and Alfred" were inspired by Wodehouse's experience as a scriptwriter in Hollywood in the 1930s.
Publication history.
The Reggie Pepper story "Rallying Round Old George", published in 1912 in the "Strand", credited both Wodehouse and Herbert Westbrook (who would collaborate with Wodehouse on the stage adaptation of the story) as authors. This story was illustrated by Charles Crombie. The American edition titled "Brother Alfred", which only credited Wodehouse as the author, was illustrated by Wallace Morgan in "Collier's". The Mulliner story "George and Alfred" was illustrated by Bill Charmatz in "Playboy".
"Rallying Round Old George" was collected in the American edition of "The Man with Two Left Feet" in 1917, and in the UK collection "My Man Jeeves" in 1919. "George and Alfred" was featured in the 1972 collection "The World of Mr. Mulliner", and in the 1985 collection of Hollywood-related Wodehouse stories, "The Hollywood Omnibus".

Frances Stephens (golfer)

Frances "Bunty" Stephens (married name Frances Stephens Smith or Frances Smith Stephens; 26 July 1924 – 23 July 1978) was an English amateur golfer.
Personal life.
Stephens was born in Lancashire where her father Fred was club professional at Bootle Golf Club. She faced discrimination from golf administrators because of his working class occupation. In 1955 she married Roy Smith, a Scottish Airlines pilot killed in a 1957 crash in Libya. They had one daughter. Stephens curtailed her playing career to raise her daughter, but subsequently was active in golf administration and developing junior golf. She was made OBE for "services to Ladies Golf" in the 1977 New Year Honours, a year before her death from cancer.
Golf career.
Stephens' home club was Royal Birkdale. She won the British Ladies Amateur in 1949 and 1954, and was runner-up in 1951 and 1952. She played in all six Curtis Cups from 1950 to 1960, and was non-playing captain of the Great Britain and Ireland team in 1962 and 1972. Her final-hole victories over Polly Riley in the 1956 and 1958 tournaments secured a win and a draw respectively for the British team, the first time it retained the cup. In the United States she was "hardly known", though she finished tied for 6th in the 1949 U.S. Women's Open. She was also a non-playing captain of the British team in the Vagliano Trophy.
Herbert Warren Wind called her a "slight, quiet, entirely undramatic girl" and an outstanding clutch player. Enid Wilson said she had "a very frail physique but ... the temperament of a tigress". Her swing had a pronounced hiatus at the top, which Wind called "most unimpressive", although Henry Cotton said she had "one of the prettiest swings in the game".

Perpetuum Immobile is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in concert in 2000 and released by Leo Records.
Recording and music.
The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in concert at Loft, in Cologne, on 26 November 2000. The producers were Nabatov and Leo Feigin. All of the nine tracks were written by Nabatov. The pianist plays "One-handed Bandit" with his right hand only.
Release and reception.
"Perpetuum Immobile" was released by Leo Records in January 2002. "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" wrote that "The influences on this solo recital come from the entire modern classical canon, and quite explicitly so." The AllMusic reviewer wrote: "Nabatov's solo piano work is entirely different than his ensemble recordings: Alone, he displays a strong romantic side that can be alternately dark and brooding or vigorously upbeat. His use of the pedals adds an atmospheric element that never devolves to mawkishness, but instead embraces life."

Final practice.
Kyle Busch was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 38.779 seconds and a speed of .
Race.
Stage 1.
Martin Truex Jr. led the field to the green flag at 3:46 p.m. Winner of three consecutive Cup races, Kevin Harvick was shooting for a higher spot in history with a fourth Sunday, but that march ended early in the race when he collided with Kyle Larson on the backstretch, bringing out the first caution on lap 39. They were running side by side when Harvick appeared to move down the track and into the side of Larson’s car. The impact sent Harvick’s car into the outside wall, causing heavy damage.
The race restarted on lap 43.
Martin Truex Jr., master of stage wins last season, scored his first of the new year, leading Kyle Busch by 3.5 seconds. Also in the top 10 were Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Larson, Kurt Busch, Erik Jones, Clint Bowyer and Denny Hamlin. The second caution of the race flew on lap 62 for the conclusion of the first stage.
Stage 2.
The race restarted on lap 67.
Trevor Bayne slapped the outside wall after slight contact with Ryan Newman. The incident produced the race’s third caution of the race, which was on lap 109. Bayne called his meeting with the wall one of the hardest of his career.
The race restarted on lap 114.
Truex scored again at the end of stage two, leading Brad Keselowski by 1.8 seconds. Following were Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Erik Jones, Joey Logano, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Larson, Clint Bowyer and William Byron. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 122 for conclusion of stage 2.
Final stage.
The race restarted on lap 127.
The fifth caution of the race flew on lap 130 when David Ragan spun out in turn 2, so Ty Dillon won the free pass under caution.
The race restarted on lap 132.
The closing portion of the race featured a battle for the lead matching Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and Kyle Larson. With 18 laps to go, Truex had a five-second lead over Busch and Larson, who were fighting for second.
Martin Truex Jr., last year’s Cup champion, returned to victory lane — a place he visited eight times in 2017 — and, at the same time, dropped Kevin Harvick’s name from NASCAR’s marquee. At least temporarily.
Post race.
“This is a reassurance that what we’re doing is working,” Truex said. “It just feels good to win. I don't really worry about who's winning or who else is fast. Obviously, the 4 (Harvick) has been quick and they have a great team. But, as we’ve seen today, we can put together a run like that, as well.
“It feels good to be able to find that speed.”

, provisional designation , is a dark and elongated asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 30 September 2014, by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope (WISE) in Earth's orbit. Closely observed at Goldstone and Arecibo in February 2018, it has a rotation period of 8.7 hours.
Orbit and classification.
 is a member of the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.90–1.70 AU once every 18 months (541 days; semi-major axis of 1.30 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30 and an inclination of 30° with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 1.70 AU, it is also a Mars-crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation by WISE in September 2014.
Close approaches.
As a potentially hazardous asteroid, has a minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.05 AU and a diameter of greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is currently , which translates into 13.8 lunar distances (LD).
2018 flyby.
On 7 February 2018 it passed from the Earth when its apparent magnitude brightened to 14. Goldstone observed it until the following day. While this was an 8.1-million kilometer flyby, the next close flyby of 6.3 million km will occur on 5 February 2058, and another 7.6 million km on 8 February 2095. It will also have a 3.2 million km flyby of Mars on 26 September 2048.
Physical characteristics.
The asteroid's spectral type is unknown. Due to its unusually low albedo "(see below)" it is likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid.
Rotation period.
On 9 February, radiometric observations by the Arecibo Observatory revealed that the asteroid has an elongated, lumpy shape. The radar images also gave it a rotational period between 8 and 9 hours. A refined period of 8.7 hour agrees with (photometric) lightcurve observations by American photometrist Brian Warner at the Center for Solar System Studies () during 9–11 February 2018, who obtained a period of 8.729 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.93 magnitude, which also indicates a non-spheroidal shape ().
Diameter and albedo.
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, measures 0.971 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.068. During its close approach in February 2018, radiometric observations by Arecibo Observatory determined that the object is at least wide.
Numbering and naming.
This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 4 November 2017 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

Philip W. Nuber

Major General Philip William Nuber (September 27, 1939 – May 21, 2003) of United States Air Force, was director of the Defense Mapping Agency from December 1994 to May 1996.
Early life and education.
Nuber was born in Bozeman, Montana on September 27, 1939. He earned a BS degree in electrical engineering from Montana State University in 1962. Nuber graduated from the Air Command and Staff College in 1975 and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces the following year. He completed the University of Pittsburgh's Management Program for Executives in 1987 and Harvard University's National and International Security Management Course in 1991.
Air Force career.
Nuber began active military service in March 1962, and earned his pilot wings in June 1963. His assignments included:
Defense Mapping Agency.
Nuber became director of the Defense Mapping Agency in December 1994, a post he held until May 1996. He brought the DMA to world attention when he provided the Global Geospatial Information System (GGIS) to President Clinton's Dayton Peace Accord to settle the boundaries of Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Kosovo. The leaders saw three-dimensional satellite imagery and mapping data of their nations, enabling them to quickly resolve boundary issues.
As director, Nuber oversaw the agency's reinvention task force. Initiated by Nuber's predecessor, Major General Raymund E. O'Mara, the task force sought to transform the DMA from a map provider to a timely source of geospatial information and services. It presented Nuber with a proposal for a completely restructured agency based on three groups: Operations, Acquisition and Technology, and Installation. He embraced and implemented the changes, profoundly changing the DMA and enhancing its talent and tradecraft. Nuber retired June 1, 1996; after 34 years of service.
Death.
Nuber died of cancer on May 21, 2003. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
Awards and decorations.
Nuber had more than 4,200 flying hours and was a veteran of three hundred combat missions. His

Mason Weaver

Clarence "Mason" Weaver is a social critic, motivational speaker, commentator, and author. He wrote "It's OK to Leave the Plantation" (1998). An African American and a conservative, he has been a guest on various conservative television programs. He is also an advisor to President Donald Trump.
Background.
Weaver changed his legal name to "Mason Weaver" in 1999. A former AM radio talk show host, he had been using this name on air for several years. Fox News describes him as a former member of the Black Panther movement.
M. Christopher Brown II wrote about meeting Weaver, exchanging ideas, and lessons he learned from him in his 2007 book "Not Equal: Expanding Educational Opportunity in Society".
"It's OK to Leave the Plantation".
In his 1998 book "It's OK to Leave the Plantation," Weaver recounts his personal trajectory "from Berkeley militant to conservative businessman," and likens the contemporary dependence of significant numbers of African Americans on government aid programs to slavery, complete with "overseers" and "drivers" of black citizens in the "mental plantation" of welfare programs, according opinion writer Vin Suprynowicz.
Kimberley Wilson of Project 21 described it as "a remarkably hopeful book written by a man who has not only faced naked racism and discrimination, but also suffered greatly because of it."
Cal Poly controversy.
On November 12, 2002, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo student Steve Hinkle posted a flier on a public bulletin board announcing a College Republicans-sponsored talk by Mason Weaver. The flyer listed the name of Weaver's book "It’s OK to Leave the Plantation" the name of the author, the date and time of the event and a picture of Mr. Weaver. Several students had complained the flier was offensive. Mr. "Hinkle offered to discuss the flier, but to no avail. After he left, a student called the university police, whose official report stated that officers had responded to complaints about “a suspicious white male passing out literature of an offensive racial nature.” The Cal Poly Judicial Affairs Office, after a seven-hour hearing in February 2003, found Hinkle guilty of "disruption of a campus event". The university was then sued by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) and the ACLU.

Club career.
Vitesse.
Buitink first joined Vitesse in 2010, from local side Veensche Boys. He made his first-team debut during Vitesse's 3–1 home victory against Feyenoord on 11 February 2018, replacing Luc Castaignos in the 80th minute.
On 31 October 2018, Buitink scored his first goal in professional football. In the last minute of a KNVB Cup match against Heracles Almelo, he decided the 0–2 end result. His first goal in the Eredivisie followed on 2 March 2019. On that day, manager Leonid Slutsky allowed him to come on for Mohammed Dauda against NAC Breda after thirty-three minutes, as NAC were leading 0–1 after a goal by Giovanni Korte. Buitink scored the equaliser nine minutes after the break and Vitesse ultimately won 4–1 thanks to goals from Maikel van der Werff, Alexander Büttner and Matúš Bero. Buitink was allowed to start in for the first time in an Eredivisie match against ADO Den Haag on 30 March 2019. ADO managed to score three goals in total via Sheraldo Becker and Lex Immers twice, but Buitink saved a 3–3 draw with a hat-trick.
During the 2019–20 season, Buitink did not score for Vitesse in competition. In January 2021, he sent on a six-month loan to PEC Zwolle. Four days after his move, he was allowed to start against Heracles Almelo. That team went into halftime with a lead thanks to goals from Lucas Schoofs and Delano Burgzorg. Five minutes after the break, Buitink assisted Virgil Misidjan's goal. Coach John Stegeman substituted Buitink in favour of Reza Ghoochannejhad, who would eventually take care of the 2–2, which also turned out to be the final score.

Araneus trifolium

Araneus trifolium, the shamrock orbweaver, is a species of orb weaver in the family Araneidae. It is found throughout the USA and in Canada.
The abdomen of "Araneus trifolium" can have various colors. Most commonly, it is seen in a beige or brown color. Occasionally, the abdomen of the spider has a greenish touch to the brown color or it may even be yellow or orange. In the latter case, "Araneus trifolium" is sometimes confused with the orange orb weaver species "Araneus marmoreus", also called pumpkin spider. The shamrock spider can be distinguished from other orb weaver species by the several white dots on its back. The legs of "Araneus trifolium" are usually brown or beige colored with several white bands around the joints. 
The shamrock spider creates a web to catch its prey. Small flying insects who fly into the web will get stuck in the sticky net. The web of an orb weaver can be up to two feet (60cm) in diameter. 
The bite of a shamrock spider can be painful but it is not dangerous for humans with effects comparable to a bee sting.

Silberhütte (Braunlage)

Silberhütte was once a village in the formerly free mining town of Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz mountains in Germany, but since its merger on 1 November 2011 it has been part of the borough of Braunlage. The name of the village goes back to the silver works that was existed here until 1912 and which smelted the ores from the mines around Sankt Andreasberg.
According to Ließmann (2003), the smelting of the ores was carried out here soon after the opening of the Sankt Andreasberg silver mines. These naturally had a raised arsenic content. The silver works was located at the confluence of the Wäschegrundbach and the Sperrlutter - so that there was enough water power to drive the machines in the smeltery. Not only did the smelting workers here have to endure toxic emissions but, even in older accounts, there is talk of the massive nuisance caused by toxic, arsenic-containing, fumes from the smeltery which, in unfavourable weather conditions, swept into the town and occasionally forced the people living there to flee.
The first smelting works are recorded at this locality around 1550. At the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the smeltery was sold and demolished. When the silver mining industry flourished again in the 1680s, a new larger smelting works was built, which - rebuilt and extended several times - was in operation until 1912. 
In 1836, the responsible mining authority allowed the construction of a separate arsenic works on the Silberhütte site. In addition to arsenic trioxide, a toxic white powder, arsenic glass was also produced. Handling the powdery poison was very difficult. The workers were only sent into the chimneys to sweep the arsenic with a damp cloth in front of their faces - without a special bonus, hardly any worker was willing to sweep the arsenic dust. A contemporary report by master smelter, Seidensticker, stated that, "the arsenic trioxide produced cannot be weighed because this would cause disproportionately high costs and endanger workers' health more than the rest of the arsenic work put together."
Closure of the silver works.
Around 1900, there were discussions about closing silver smeltery, but this was not carried out straight away out of consideration for its employees. After the Samson Pit had been taken out of service, ores from overseas were smelted until it was finally decommissioned in 1912. This delay was intended to cushion the loss of jobs in Sankt Andreasberg. The land and buildings were sold to wood-processing and other trades on the condition that it should create jobs. In the following years, however, it became clear that this requirement could not be fulfilled. Most of the silver smelting works were purchased by Rudolph Alberti, who temporarily operated the Harz "Glück Auf" factory at this location, but they were all shut down in 1929. That same year the timber works and crate factory, which had also been located on the site, closed.
Metallwerke Silberhütte/Schmiedag AG.
During 1934m Federstahl AG Kassel bought the land and real estate of the "Glück Auf" works. In addition, further plots of land and real estate were purchased by Bauholzwerke und Kistenfabrik St. Andreasberg, the Prussian State Forestry Commission, the firm of C. F. Hertwig and Mr and Mrs Albrecht. In October that year, Federstahl AG Kassel moved its headquarters to Sankt Andreasberg and changed its name to Metallwerke Silberhütte. By November 1934, it announced it was starting work. At first, however, major construction work was necessary, which took more than a year; construction activity was brisk during autumn and winter 1935. The management's report for 1935 states that in Shed I, which was located on the site of the former "Glück Auf" works, hunting cartridges were to be produced and in Shed II, which was located on the premises of the former timber and box factory, steel boats were to be produced. Shed III, which was on land owned by C. F. Hertwig, was leased to[Schmiedag] in Hagen/Westphalia.
Production started in 1936. Shed I produced infantry ammunition for the standard Wehrmacht rifle, Shed II produced clips for rifle ammunition, and Shed III was leased to Vereinigte Gesenkschmiede (Schmiedag), which produced shell cases for artillery ammunition.
In July 1935, 44 workers and employees were employed on converting existing buildings and constructing new ones. A year later, when production started, the number of employees had already risen to 143, and the number of employees continued to rise in the following years, from 336 in July 1937 to 348 in July and 348 in July. 
In 1938, 16,562,000 rounds of ammunitation were manufactured at Shed I, and in 1940 the factory was expanded with the addition of air-raid shelters and laboratory buildings.
In Shed II, where production also began in 1936, "strip-iron products" were manufactured from 1937 onwards, and there is no longer any indications of steel boat production. In 1938, 8,900,000 clips were produced. The company also invested in Shed II in 1940 by purchasing a low-voltage machine.
As the war started, production and weekly working hours increased and two-shift operation was introduced.
As a result of the war, production figures continued to rise, although the quantities demanded by the army were not attained, with the exception of a few months. The demand for labour increased, so that from 1942 onwards, Soviet forced labourers were employed. The production of the ammunition clips was moved to Shed I in order to erect RAD barracks on the site where the forced labourers were accommodated. In addition, residents of Sankt Andreasberg were required to work and skilled workers recruited by the Wehrmacht were recalled from duty.
On 1 April 1945, the workforce comprised 1,141 people, including 374 workers, 36 salaried employees and 731 foreigners. The village of Silberhütte was captured without a fight by the US Army on 14 April and the forced labourers were freed. However, shortly afterwards, they were interned again in the same camp as before and transported away on 20 June 1945. The facilities were plundered after 14 April 1945. The dismantling of the remaining facilities was completed by 1950. Afterwards, the properties were put to industrial re-use.
British Army Mountain Training Camp (AMTC).
Until 1990, the Army Mountain Training Camp (AMTC) of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was located on the site of Shed II. The camp offered space for a maximum of 200 people. Here, BAOR soldiers were trained in various skills such as skiing, mountaineering and climbing as well as survival techniques.
Pollution.
In 2004, a study by the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES) on heavy metal pollution in red deer and roe deer, found high concentrations of lead and cadmium in the area of the silver smelting works in their livers and kidneys and partly also in their muscles. However, the residues of arsenic, antimony and mercury in muscles and storage organs were only small. The levels of cadmium in the organs exceeded the residue levels of the EU's Contaminants Regulation, in some cases, considerably. However, this regulation does not apply to the meat and edible tissues of wild game. There are copies of the investigation report in the forest offices at Lauterberg and Riefensbeek. 
In 2005, the Lower Saxony Forestry Office in Lauterberg had around 6,000 tonnes of contaminated hazardous waste disposed of from the site above the Silberhütte - stockpile material from the smelting works and contaminated soils as well as residues from flue gas ducts and chimneys. The materials were highly contaminated with arsenic and heavy metals. The buildings had simply been destroyed after the closure of the hut and remained on site. Investigations of the site revealed that the area had to be cleaned. Excavators removed the contaminated material. Afterwards, the excavated area was covered with unpolluted soil and a loose layer of mountain meadow hay was laid out to prepare for reforestation. With this remediation, the district of Goslar as the licensing authority and the Lower Saxony Forestry Office of Lauterberg as the land owner also took precautions for water protection in the planned "Pöhlder Becken" water protection area.

She was still in service on the outbreak of the Second World War, taking part in the German Invasion of Poland at the start of the war and the evacuation of East Prussia towards the end of the war in Europe.
She survived the war, and was transferred to the Soviet Navy in 1945, and was renamed "Pronzitelny". The ship was stricken in 1949.

The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ordered from Germaniawerft and the other six ships from AG Vulcan. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders.
"G196" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load.
Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 145 tons of coal and 76 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at .
The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two on the ship's beam in the gap between the forecastle and the ship's bridge which were capable of firing straight ahead, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.
"G196" was laid down at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard as Yard number 156 and was launched on 25 May 1911 and completed on 2 October 1911.
The ship was extensively modified in 1923, with the forecastle being lengthened to behind the first funnel, the bridge structure and funnels being modified. The boilers were replaced by three oil-fired boilers, with power dropping to and speed to . Two 10.5 cm L/45 guns replaced the 8.8 cm guns, while the torpedo armament remained four 50 cm tubes, but arranged in two single and one twin mount. By the Second World War, her torpedo tubes had been removed, while two 20 mm anti-aircraft guns had been added.
Service.
On commissioning, "G196" joined the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, and remained part of the 2nd Half Flotilla in 1914.
First World War.
On 28 August 1914, the British Harwich Force, supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. The German defensive patrols around Heligoland consisted of one flotilla (the 1st Torpedo Flotilla) of 12 modern torpedo boats forming an outer patrol line about North and West of Heligoland, with an inner line of older torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division at about . Four German light cruisers and another flotilla of torpedo boats (the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) was in the vicinity of Heligoland. G196, a member of the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, formed part of the outer screen of torpedo boats. At about 06:00 on 28 August, , another member of the outer screen reported spotting the periscope of a submarine. As a result, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla was ordered out to hunt the hostile submarine. At 07:57 "G194" was fired on by British warships, and soon "G194" and "G196" were retreating towards Heligoland, pursued by four British destroyers. The 5th Flotilla and the old torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division also came under British fire, and were only saved by the intervention of the German cruisers and , with the torpedo boats , and "T111" damaged. The Torpedo boat , leader of the 1st Flotilla, trying to return to Heligoland on hearing gunfire, ran into the midst of the Harwich force and was sunk. The intervention of the supporting British forces resulted in the sinking of the German cruisers , and . The British light cruiser and destroyers , and were badly damaged but safely returned to base. "G196" was undamaged.
On 11 September 1915, the German cruisers and set out from Wilhelmshaven to lay a minefield off the Swarte Bank in the North Sea, with the High Seas Fleet sailing in support. On the return trip, the High Seas Fleet ran into a newly laid British minefield. "G196", which was off the port beam of the battleship , struck one of the mines and was badly damaged, being towed into port by another destroyer.
In 1918 "G196" joined an Escort Flotilla, and she was renamed "T196" on 22 February 1918. She remained a member of the 1st Half-flotilla of the 1st Escort Flotilla at the end of the war.
Between the wars.
After the end of the First World War, the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles left Germany with a small navy of obsolete warships. The Versailles treaty limited the German Navy's torpedo forces to 16 destroyers and 16 torpedo boats, with only twelve of each in active service, with replacement of the existing ships not allowed until 15 years after they were launched. Replacements could not exceed 800 t displacement for destroyers and 200 t for torpedo boats. "T196" was retained as a destroyer under the treaty, and remained in active service in the new Reichsmarine. In 1923 "T196" was allocated to the North Sea station. "T196" was modernised in 1923, but was still obsolete and in the 1930s was transferred to subsidiary roles, being used for training and as a Fleet Tender, and from 1938 as a minesweeper command ship.
Second World War.
On the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939, "T196" was the flagship of the Officer Commanding Minesweepers and was deployed in support on the German Invasion of Poland. On 4 September "T196", along with the pre-dreadnought battleship and the old minesweeper "Von der Groeben" (formerly ), bombarded Westerplatte.
In late January 1945, the Germans began a mass evacuation of soldiers and civilians from East Prussia and Danzig, which were threatened by the advance of Soviet forces. On 10 February "T196" and the torpedo recovery vessel "TF19" were escorting the liner "Steuben" from Pillau, when the Soviet submarine "S-13" torpedoed and sank "Steuben". Only about 300 of the more than 3000 aboard could be saved.
Soviet Union.
On 27 December 1945 "T196" was transferred to the Soviet Union as a War Prize, named "Pronzitelny" () The ship joined the Soviet Baltic Fleet in February 1946 and was stricken for scrapping on 30 April 1949.

El Shafee Elsheikh

 
El Shafee Elsheikh (born 16 July 1988), known as Jihadi George, is a Sudanese-born British man who has been designated a terrorist by the United States and identified in the press as one of the four Jihadi Beatles who took part in atrocities of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS and Daesh. Elsheikh has denied being a member of "the Beatles" but admits joining the ISIL terrorist group.
Early life.
Born in Sudan, Elsheikh spent his youth in London, England. "The Daily Telegraph" reports he was a follower of a local football team, Queen's Park Rangers, and dreamed of joining the team when he grew up.
Allegations of ties to terrorism.
In 2014 and 2015, Daesh held dozens of European and North American captives, and the brutal conditions of their detention was widely reported. Four English-speaking Daesh fighters played a central role in the brutality. Their identities were initially either not known or security officials did not make their identities known to the public, so the press dubbed the four as The Beatles, with Mohammed Emwazi, the most well-known being known of the group, having been dubbed Jihadi John. Later, Elsheikh was reported to have been one of the other three Beatles.
On March 30, 2017, Elsheikh and four other men were named as suspected terrorists, by the US State Department, under Executive Order 13224. This Executive Order signed by President George W. Bush, shortly after al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001, allowed the State Department to bar US citizens, US financial institutions, and other US corporations, from having any financial transactions with designated individuals.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured Elsheikh, and his friend Alexanda Kotey, on January 24, 2018. as he was fleeing from the collapse of Daesh, the short-lived "Islamic State". The pair were reported to have been trying to blend in with genuine civilian refugees, fleeing the collapse of the last Daesh enclaves.
Prosecution.
"The Independent" reported that the United Kingdom government was considering agreeing that Kotey and Elsheikh could be transferred to the Guantanamo detention camps.
Detention in Guantanamo could be indefinite detention, without charge, if transferred to US custody. For a civilian trial, they would likely be detained at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, if they were convicted. "The Independent" described how bleak conditions would be at the Florence Supermax, confinement to a featureless cell, for 23 hours a day, practically no human contact, exercise periods in a small featureless courtyard, near their cell.
Another option under consideration is trial at the International Court in The Hague. According to "The Independent", the UK government would first strip Kotey and Elsheikh of UK citizenship, prior to agreeing to transfer to The Hague.
"The Guardian" quoted Tobias Ellwood, the UK Minister of Defence, who argued that transfer to Guantanamo was inappropriate.
In a face-to-face interview with Jenan Moussa of Al Aan TV in Kobanî, Syria, at the beginning of April 2018 Elsheikh said he was interviewed by US and Syrian Democratic Forces officials, but not by UK officials.
On 7 October 2020, Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey were brought to the United States to face charges of beheading western hostages.

Central Women's Sniper Training School

The Central Women's Sniper Training School () was a Soviet military school for training female snipers for battle in the Second World War, more commonly referred to as the Great Patriotic War among Soviet Troops. Throughout the war the school trained 1061 snipers and 407 sniper instructors. The school yielded several highly successful snipers who became decorated veterans, and two graduates were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.
History.
The school was established in Veshnyaki, Moscow Oblast after an order issued on 20 March 1942 by the People's Commissariat of Defence to establish the school. Potential students had to be at least 20 years old, physically fit, graduated at least seven of their secondary school classes, and pass the initial 4-day Vsevobuch program. After a parade and swearing upon an oath the school was officially opened on 3 May.
In February 1943 students of the school donated 69,260 rubles of their combined savings to kickstart further rifle manufacturing. That same month a practice shooting range was opened in Kosino. In May the school officially became the Central Women's Sniper Training School. On 25 June the school was ordered to form two battalions and a unit of sniper instructors after 50 graduates were sent to the Kalinin Front and another 54 sent to the Northwestern Front among the first batch of cadets. In July a second set of cadets swore their military oath and began their training. Cadets who passed the Moscow Higher Military Command School exam in addition to graduating achieved the rank of junior lieutenant. Of the March 1944 graduating class, 150 were sent to the Northwestern Front, 75 to the 2nd Baltic Front, 200 to the Western Front, 75 to the 1st Baltic Front, and 85 to the 1st Belorussian Front.
In May 1944 the third batch of cadets took their oath and began training. On 25 November 1944, 559 of the women left the academy for active duty before the rest of the remaining 411 students of their graduating class were deployed to the warfront in February. Those students included 95 sent to the 1st Belorussian Front, 87 sent to the 2nd Belorussian Front, 110 sent to the 1st Ukrainian Front, and 119 were sent to the 4th Ukrainian Front.
The school was disbanded from 15 March to 10 May 1945 while personnel were transferred to the Moscow Higher Military Command School.

Wellshill Cemetery

Wellshill Cemetery is a 19th century cemetery in northern Perth in Scotland. The cemetery is still operational and is under the control of Perth and Kinross Council.
In general the grounds are well-landscaped and well-maintained but with some minor vandalism in the central sections. Unlike many council cemeteries stones are not laid flat if considered dangerous but instead are marked with caution tapes.
History.
The cemetery was opened in 1844 as a private cemetery. The original section and original entrance gates lie to the south-east.
A parochial (free section) was added to the north around 1860 and further private sections added to the west (now the centre)
and far north. A modern section was added by the Council on former Jeanfield recreation ground to the west, and is known as Jeanfield Cemetery.
A wall exists between the two cemeteries but the wall has a gap at each end for mutual access.
Modern access is from the south-west on Jeanfield Road. The feature nearest the modern entrance is the monument and attached graves of the 381 Polish pilots who died serving Britain during the Second World War. There are over 90 Commonwealth service personnel and one Belgian soldier buried in the cemetery from the First World War and over 120 Commonwealth personnel from the Second. The cemetery contains a total 573 war graves, maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, of persons who died of wounds, mainly at Perth Royal Infirmary, and other causes.
The Polish code-breaker Lieutenant Colonel Gwido Langer was also originally buried here in 1948, as a Polish Signal Corps grave within the Polish war graves, but his body was exhumed in 2010 for reburial in Poland with full military honours.
Notable interments.
The only grave of note (apart from war graves) in the Jeanfield section is the poet William Soutar (1898-1943)

MÁV Class V40

The MÁV Class V40 was an electric locomotive of the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the first production electric locomotive using the Kandó system. It had a wheel arrangement of 1'D1' or 2-8-2 and a single traction motor driving through side rods.
Overview.
Power for the electrification of railway traffic in Hungary could be extracted most economically from the nationwide 50 Hz electricity grid. Therefore, Kálmán Kandó developed his eponymous drive system, which is based on single-phase AC overhead lines and three-phase traction motors. The conversion of the current for the traction motor is provided by a rotary phase converter. The system was demonstrated on a test locomotive from 1923 and, from 1932 to 1935, the route from Budapest to Hegyeshalom was electrified at 16 kV, 50 Hz. The first electric locomotives on the line were of the MÁV V40 class. They were mixed-traffic locomotives with a top speed of 100 km/h. A total of 29 locomotives of this class were used on the said route. In the 1960s, the traction current system in Hungary was converted to 25 kV, 50 Hz and the Kandó locomotives were withdrawn.
Preservation.
V40.016 is preserved in the Hungarian Railway History Park, Budapest, after standing for years at Budapest East Railway Station.
Technical features.
The single-phase alternating current taken from the overhead line was converted into three-phase current by the phase converter and supplied to a single traction motor which was a 48-pole asynchronous motor. The phase converter provided four fixed speeds (25,50,75 and 100 km/h) and intermediate speeds were obtained using a liquid rheostat.
Final drive was through a Kandó triangle with one arm connected to an auxiliary idling shaft to minimise unwanted vertical forces. The locomotive was built on a rigid frame. Two of the driving axles had side play, which was controlled by Krauss-Helmholtz bogies.
Other Kandó locomotives.
The experimental Kandó locomotive was MÁV Class V50, built 1923. Its wheel arrangement was E or 0-10-0. A freight version of the Class V40 was also built. This was the Class V60, built 1932, which had a wheel arrangement of F or 0-12-0.

Stuart Turner (company)

Stuart Turner Ltd is a British engineering company, based in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, founded by engineer Sidney Marmaduke Stuart Turner in 1906.
History of the company.
Before World War I.
Stuart Turner Ltd was incorporated in 1906 and started to produce model steam engines, gas engines for domestic electricity, lathes, etc. Stuart Turner went on to produce further model steam designs, and in 1906 there were nine models in the range. By 1907 more space was needed so premises were rented at Market Place in the centre of Henley-On-Thames, where the company remained for many years.
The 2-stroke engine with crankcase compression had been invented by Joseph Day in the mid-1890s. This made possible lightweight engines and new applications. Stuart Turner was exploring making small 2-strokes for motorcycles and generators. In 1911, Stuart Turner developed a complete motorcycle using a Chater-Lea frame and Druid forks. The key part manufactured by Stuart was the 2-port single cylinder 2-stroke engine rated at 2 1/2 HP (71 x 75.5mm bore and stroke giving 299cc). They exhibited it at the 1911 Olympia show (on the stand of R.G. Nye and Co of London). 
In 1912 and 1913 they marketed the Stuart Stellar (some early references use 'Stella') motorcycle, this used an in-line two-cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine complete with shaft drive. Engine capacity is variously quoted as 743 cc and 786 cc. This would be comparable with the Scott motorcycle of the time which had a transverse water cooled two-stroke twin-cylinder engine of 532 cc. However, in-spite of the innovative design, the Stellar was not a success and only 26 examples were built.
The firm secured the contract to make engines for the Dayton motorised bicycle made by Charles Day Manufacturing Co in Shoreditch, London, which was until then purely a bicycle manufacturer. This went on sale in late 1913. The engine has a one-piece cylinder and head with a rear-facing spark plug, and was of 162 cc, rated at 1.5 HP. The bore was 57 mm and the stroke 63.5 mm, and it had a U.H. magneto and Amac (NB not Amal which is a different company) carburettor. Both single-speed and two-speed versions were available, and prices in July 1914 were 20 to 28 guineas according to specification.
Two employees, Alec Plint and W.G. Ayling, rode the Dayton bikes in motorcycle endurance events run by the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU), such as the six days trial. Weighing only 148 lb, these were usually the smallest motorcycles competing. These events included riding between and taking part in various tests, such as hill starts, acceleration and braking, cold starts, and climbing steep rough hills. Total distance for the 1914 event was 674 miles. The Daytons did well given that they were considered rather lacking in power as revealed by this excerpt from the Motor Cycle magazine of July 1914 – 'Ayling (Dayton) footed vigorously, but got his lilliputian engine to the top'. Production of engines for the Dayton was 20 engines per week, but production of the Dayton motorcycle ceased in 1915 due to the first World War.
Many of the technical developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on five Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet non-return valve is the subject of another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.
In 1914, the company manufactured a generating plant for the Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance. It was used in the ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.
During World War I.
During World War I (1914–18), the company produced nuts and bolts, gas valves and a klaxon horn for gas attack warnings. The workforce expanded to over 300 men and 100 women. In 1917, Stuart Turner acquired Broadgates Inn in Market Place, Henley-on-Thames, and has used this as a base ever since.
The inter-war years.
Shortly after the war, Stuart Turner introduced the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants. This engine was to form the basis of a range of engines used for small power applications, particularly as marine engines and to drive generators, though also to drive equipment and pumps. Castings were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268 cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535 cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines, Stuart Turner produced a reversing gearbox and optional final drive reduction gear; everything else, up to and including the screw propeller, was also available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number; so, for example, a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas Dynamotor, Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter).
Between 1932 and 1935, Stuart Turner produced the small (1/2 HP) type N engine, which had an overhung crank. This model seems to have been superseded by the type R 2-stroke engine, which was introduced in 1934 with a full width crank. The R2 being 84 cc, and the R3 having a larger bore size and hence 123 cc. These small engines were used for general utility, but also the R3M for pleasure boats, hire boats. The R3 was to continue in production until 1977.
The model engineering range was extensive throughout the inter-war years, with much production sold as kits of castings, though some complete engines were also sold. Most of the models were designed to be representative of a class of engine, mainly steam driven, rather than an accurate scale recreation of a specific engine. Internal combustion engines were also available as kits, including the 'lightweight' 2-stroke petrol engine. From 1935, Stuart Turner was also the United Kingdom agent for the American 'Brown Junior' 10 cc engine for which they developed an aluminium (elektron) airscrew. Some of the engines were intended to do a job of work rather than for the entertainment of a model engineer, for example, the 1935 Sandhurst horizontal 2/3 bhp engine, which was described thus: 'This engine will run on gas or petrol and is designed for continuous work such as dynamo, workshop or pump driving. It is supplied only as castings for the amateur to machine up.'. The larger steam engines, for example, the model 6A, are capable of 4 bhp and powering steam launches, thereby blurring the distinction between whether they were model engines, or designed to do a job of work, or both.
Many ancillaries were sold to illustrate the power from the model engines, such as the Avery Multipolar dynamo. In the 1906 catalogue, this dynamo (output of 20 volts, 4 amps at 1200 rpm) was said to have been "designed for use with a Stuart No2 engine". A variety of dynamos were sold over the years allowing them to be matched to the power of the model engine.
Stuart Turner also produced a wide range of boilers to power their steam engines, and sold matched boiler and steam engine as complete 'steam plants'. The most common boilers are the small 501 and 504 copper horizontal types used to drive the model steam engines, but they also produced a range of riveted steel vertical boilers up to 20 inches diameter, and 36 inches high, either with a central flue or with multiple tubes. They also offered brazing services for customers' boilers.
They also produced two complete model steamboats. The 24-inch Henley was produced from 1925, and had a single-cylinder S.T. oscillating steam engine, and the 39-inch Isis was launched the next year with a model 495 boiler and the twin-cylinder Star steam engine. These boats were produced until at least 1936, probably until the war disrupted matters. There was a version of the Henley steamboat powered by a Stuart Turner electric motor; this boat was sold as the 'Magician'. The 4-volt electric motor was also sold separately.
In 1923 the War Office invited Stuart Turner (and other firms) to design a very light air-cooled engine and generator for wireless. It was to be carried on a pack mule. The whole plant must not weigh more than 84 lb, it had to run in any temperature from freezing to 60 °C; it must not be affected by being carried upside down or in any position; it must govern within 5% and there were various other conditions. The result was that five firms produced engines but the Stuart Turner engine was the only one which fulfilled the requirements and passed the tests. This was the W.D. engine, which was a 4-stroke side-valve flat twin, and continued in production for 20 years. Two of these engines were taken on the 1933 Everest expedition to power the wireless sets.
From 1928 until the war, the company issued nine patents (again naming Alec Plint) for milking machines and developed a diaphragm pulsatory milking machine which was marketed by Gascoine of Reading, who later took over the rights. They also developed pumps, and in the 1933 Bond's catalogue a complete Stuart Turner electric motor and centrifugal pump on a baseplate with 180, 800, or 1120 gallons per hour was advertised. This evolved into the current product line of centrifugal pumps.
In 1932, Stuart Turner produced the model K 4-stroke engine, which was a single-cylinder overhead-valve engine designed to power refrigeration units. Only 64 were made, the last in 1938.
In 1934, Stuart Turner introduced the S type steam engine. This was not a model but a fully enclosed single-cylinder commercial power unit of 1 to 1.5 HP designed to drive generators or fans or pumps. It stood 22 inches tall with a 10-inch flywheel and weighed about 120 lb. Preston Services have stated that there were both slide valve and piston valve versions, only 247 were made between 1934 and 1962.
In 1938, Stuart Turner developed a single-cylinder 2-stroke diesel with crankcase compression, the model H. At the time this was the smallest commercial diesel engine in the world. These engines were sold mainly to the RNLI for charging batteries.
During World War II.
The company produced a number of products for the military during World War II (1939–45), including combined boiler, steam engine and generator plants, designed to be used by resistance fighters or troops operating covertly behind enemy lines to power radio transmitters. The first of these modest-sized steam generator plants was called the Firefly, and was based around the Stuart Sirius engine, later ones named Mk814 had a bespoke single-cylinder piston valve engine.
Stuart Turner also produced many internal combustion generators with uses such as charging aircraft batteries and providing dummy runway lights on fake airfields. Stuart Turner engines were built into the back of AEC fuel bowser trucks to drive a Zwicky Ltd pump to transfer fuel to aircraft. These P5XC engines were referred to in-house as the Zwicky engines.
After World War II.
Stuart Turner continued to make engines (especially marine engines), pumps, generators, and model kits throughout the post-war years, though several of the pre-war model internal combustion engines did not reappear.
The pre-war single-cylinder diesel engine was joined by a new twin-cylinder 2-stroke diesel in 1953, the H2/H2M/H2MR. Whereas the single had used crankcase compression to scavenge the cylinder, the twin-cylinder had two air pumps. Rated at 9 HP, the capacity was 780 cc, and weight 240 kg. The Single Cylinder Model H was updated to the H1, and many of its detail design features were changed, and ultimately it looked very much like a H2 minus a cylinder. Only 15 H1's were made. The single-cylinder diesel was phased out in 1960 and the twin in 1968, with only about 400 of each model produced.
A four-stroke twin-cylinder petrol engine (the 12HP ST4/ST4M/ST4MR/ST4RE) was introduced in May 1968. Rated at 12 HP, it was the most powerful engine in the range. This side-valve engine was 955 cc capacity and weighed 155 kg. Both hand-start and electric-start versions were produced, but production was only about 150 engines, and it was phased out in 1975.
In 1969, the P5 and the P55 twin were replaced by the more powerful 5 HP P6 and 10 HP P66 (both at the higher speed of 1650 rpm). There were a number of detailed differences, including a change to the ignition system, but the bore and stroke remained the same.
Stuart Turner marketed some small marine diesels from the Spanish marine engine company Solé as the Stuart Solé. Solé converts engines from a wide variety of manufacturers for marine use. From a 1977 Stuart Solé operators manual, it is known that Stuart Solé engines were available in 6 hp and 9 hp variants, which seem identical in appearance to the Solé Mini-1 and Mini-2 engines, based on Lombardini engines and made by Solé between 1974 and 1986. These were a common fitment in vessels made by the Cornish Crabbers boat-building company in the late 1970s and probably into the early 1980s, one 1981 example being listed for sale with an 11 hp Stuart Solé engine.
Stuart Turner ceased their marine engine production in 1978, and the spares and support were transferred to another company. In 1987, Stuart Turner Ltd acquired Morewood Model Engineers and the Stuart Model range moved to Cheddar in Somerset. Still branded as Stuart Models, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Stuart Turner Ltd. Cheddar Models Ltd was formed as an offshoot from Stuart Models in the late 1980s. In 1991, the brand and range were sold to David Jones of Jones and Bradburn and it moved to Guernsey. When Cheddar Models went bankrupt in 2005 models and plans were absorbed back into the Stuart Model range. At some point, possibly as part of this reorganisation, Stuart Models had acquired the rights to the Plastow Traction Engine model range, which they sold in October 2006 to Bridport foundry of Dorset, who had been responsible for the castings. In July 2012 Stuart Models was bought by Bridport Foundry.
Stuart Turner Ltd continued making domestic water pumps staying at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England.

Cape Bersen'yeva (Russian: "Mys Bersen'yeva") is a headland in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia.
Geography.
The cape is on the northeastern side of Tugur Bay, 20 km (about 12 mi) to the west of Seneka Point. It is high and conspicuous, rising to a height of 162 m (531 ft). 
History.
American whaleships frequented the waters off the cape between 1854 and 1889, anchoring off it and sending whaleboats down the bay for bowhead whales or sending boats to the cape itself to cruise for whales as well. Boat crews also camped at the cape. They called it Silas Richards Bluff, after the ship "Silas Richards", of New Bedford, which was wrecked in a bay near the cape on 13 July 1854. On 27 July 1867, the bark "Java", of New Bedford, was ordered out of Tugur Bay near the cape by a Russian man-of-war.

Cyclone Gita

Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita was the most intense tropical cyclone to impact Tonga since reliable records began. The second named storm and first major tropical cyclone of the 2017–18 South Pacific cyclone season, Gita originated from a monsoon trough that was active in the South Pacific in early February 2018. First classified as a tropical disturbance on 3 February, the nascent system meandered near Vanuatu for several days with little development. After acquiring a steady east trajectory near Fiji, it organized into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 9 February near Samoa. Arcing south in a clockwise turn, the system rapidly intensified, and became a severe tropical cyclone on 10 February near Niue.
Throughout its path in the South Pacific, Cyclone Gita affected multiple island nations and territories. Tonga was the hardest-hit, with severe damage occurring on the islands of Tongatapu and ʻEua; two fatalities and forty-one injuries occurred in the kingdom. At least 171 homes were destroyed and more than 1,100 suffered damage. Violent winds destroyed homes and left the two islands largely without power. Torrential rains and damaging winds caused widespread disruptions in Samoa and American Samoa, prompting emergency declarations in both. Outlying islands in the Fijian Lau Islands were significantly affected, particularly Ono-i-Lau and Vatoa. Wallis and Futuna, Niue, and Vanuatu were also affected, but impacts in those areas were minor. Total damage from Gita is estimated to be in excess of US$252 million, primarily in American Samoa and Tonga.
Meteorological history.
On 3 February, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 07F, which had developed within a trough of low pressure, about to the southeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name="TDS 03/02"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The system was poorly organized and was located along an upper-level ridge of high pressure, in an area of high vertical wind shear. Over the next couple of days, the system moved erratically near northern Vanuatu and remained poorly organized, with convection located to the south of the low-level circulation center.&lt;ref name="TDS 05/02"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The system subsequently started to move south-eastwards, towards the Fijian Islands and a favorable environment for further development, on 5 February. The system subsequently passed near the island nation during 8 February, where it developed into a tropical depression and started to move north-eastwards towards the Samoan Islands. During 9 February, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 09P, after an ASCAT image showed that it had winds of in its northern semicircle. The FMS subsequently named the system Tropical Cyclone Gita early, after the United States National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Pago Pago requested that the system be named early for warning and humanitarian reasons.&lt;ref name="TDA 09/02"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
After Gita was named, a prolonged period of rapid intensification ensued as it quickly intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, before it passed within of Samoa and American Samoa. After moving past the Samoan Islands, Gita turned southeast, then southwards, under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the northeast. On 10 February, Gita rapidly intensified to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale while traversing anomalously warm sea surface temperatures of between . The system bypassed Niue to the east during this intensification phase. On 11 February, Gita continued to intensify into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. At the same time, Gita turned westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the south. Around 12:00 UTC on 12 February, the cyclone passed near or over the Tongan islands of ʻEua and Tongatapu as a high-end Category 4 severe tropical cyclone. At this time, maximum 10-minute sustained winds were estimated at 195 km/h (120 mph) making Gita the strongest cyclone to strike the nation since reliable records began. The JTWC estimated the system to have reached its overall peak intensity at this time as a Category 4-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale with 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph).
At 18:00 UTC on 13 February, Gita reached its peak strength approximately 205 km (125 mi) south of Kandavu, Fiji, as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone with ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), gusts to 285 km/h (180 mph), a minimum pressure of 927 mbar (hPa; 27.37 inHg).
Impact.
Gita impacted the Pacific island nations and territories of Vanuatu, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, Samoa, American Samoa, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Caledonia, and New Zealand, with the most significant damage being reported in the Samoan Islands and Tonga. Owing to the cyclone's significant and widespread impact, the name "Gita" was retired following its usage and will never be used for a South Pacific tropical cyclone again.
Samoa.
Gita brought torrential rain to parts of Samoa on 8–9 February. Accumulations averaged across the country, peaking at along the eastern slops of Mount Le Pu'e on Upolu. Storm-force winds impacted the nation, reaching at Faleolo International Airport and in Apia. Multiple rivers in the city burst their banks and inundated homes. At least 233 people sought refuge in emergency shelters. Landslides and flooding rendered many roads impassable. Communications were briefly lost with the southern coast of Upolu. A state of disaster was declared for the nation on 10 February. Damage to the power grid reached $10 million. No casualties were reported nationwide.
American Samoa.
On 8 February, the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Pago Pago issued a tropical storm watch, a high surf advisory, and a flash flood watch for all of American Samoa as the nascent cyclone approached the territory. With Tropical Depression 08F existing simultaneously to the south of Fiji, uncertainty existed in the exact track of Gita. However, NWS Forecasters emphasized the risk of flash floods and mudslides as the interaction of two cyclones led to persistent monsoonal flow across the region. In the two days preceding Gita's arrival, this monsoon trough produced significant rains, reaching . Monsoonal rains continued for two days after Cyclone Gita, and the flash flood watch was finally discontinued on 12 February. The American Samoa Emergency Management Agency advised residents to "remain on alert and secure loose items as necessary". The tropical storm watch was soon upgraded to a warning, indicating the expected arrival of gale-force winds within 36 hours. Pago Pago International Airport suspended operations for the duration of the storm. The NWS discontinued the tropical storm warning late on 9 February as Gita moved away from the territory.
Cyclone Gita reached American Samoa on 9 February, bringing heavy rains and strong winds from 4:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. local time. The strongest winds were recorded at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory Office in Cape Matatula on Tutuila; sustained values reached and gusts peaked at . These winds tore roofs of structures and downed trees and power lines across the territory, with the most severe damage reported in Nu'uuli and Tafuna. Approximately 90 percent of the island was left without power and water and nearly 1,000 people required evacuation. The NWS Office lost power; the Honolulu, Hawaii, office issued forecasts in the interim. Rainfall in Pago Pago exceeded . Flash floods and mudslides occurred territory-wide, with valleys and low-lying areas being most affected. Multiple streams flooded and prompted evacuations in Malaeloa village. Landslides were reported in Avau, Amanave, and Poloa. Approximately 3,000 people reported damage to their crops. Destruction of banana, papaya, and breadfruit crops temporarily limited the availability of food.
Offshore, the cargo ship "Uila o le Sami" sank near Taʻū during the storm. Approximately off Leone Bay, the Taiwanese-flagged fishing vessel "Chui Kai Fa No. 1" grounded on 5 February and split in half. The vessel was previously adrift in international waters following a fire on 4 November 2017. The grounding of the "Chui Kai Fa No. 1" prompted the closure the closure of the port of Pago Pago until 11 February. The vessel contained an estimated of diesel fuel and a light oil sheen was reported in the area. Inclement weather produced by Cyclone Gita impeded response efforts by the United States Coast Guard.
An assessment by the American Samoa Public Works in March 2018 determined that Cyclone Gita destroyed 387 homes, inflicted major damage to more than 1,300 homes, and damaged a further 1,600. The American Samoa Department of Commerce estimated that half of the territory's population suffered some form of property loss and placed total damage at US$200 million. A 2019 report by the American Samoa Economic Forecast calculated combined direct and indirect losses at US$186 million. The National Centers for Environmental Information calculated a lower damage total of US$52 million. In contrast to the scale of damage, no fatalities or injuries were reported.
On 10 February, a Coast Guard AC-130 conducted aerial surveys of the territory and a small group of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel were deployed. By 18 April, almost 100 federal personnel were deployed to the territory. United States President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for American Samoa on 11 February. The United States Army Reserve assisted FEMA and the American Red Cross with the deployment of personnel and distribution of relief supplies. Furthermore, the Army Reserve Pago Pago facility was converted into a staging area for the disaster response. The United Nations Development Programme initiated a US$100,000 response plan on 16 February to support the local governmental response. President Trump later declared the territory a major disaster area on 2 March. Following this declaration, the Internal Revenue Service announced that residents could apply for tax exemptions. Health officials advised residents to boil water amid an enhanced risk of dengue fever. StarKist Samoa donated US$50,000 to the American Samoa Government on 16 March. On 9 April 2019, Representative Nita Lowey (D-NY) introduced the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 () bill to the 116th Congress. The bill, signed into law by President Trump on 6 June, provided just over US$17.2 billion for disaster recovery nationwide; of this US$18 million was allocated for American Samoa and made available through February 2020. However, distribution of these funds was delayed and Governor Lolo Matalasi Moliga urged the United States Department of Agriculture to expedite the process. Through March 2021, FEMA provided US$31,198,512.50 in financial assistance: $20,543,787.44 in individual funds, US$9,763,391.26 for public assistance, and US$891,333.80 for a hazard mitigation program. A further US$40 million was provided through the Small Business Administration, intergovernmental agreements, disaster grants, and private distributions.
A prolonged downturn in the territory's tuna industry in the decade preceding Gita led to an economic recession. The nationwide reconstruction efforts and the influx of money in the wake of the cyclone spurred slight growth of the American Samoa economy, reflecting in the gross domestic product increasing by 2.2 percent in 2018, and a pause in the recession. This economic stimulation quickly subsided and American Samoa's economy contracted in 2019.
Tonga.
Prior to and during the cyclone, approximately 5,700 residents sought refuge in public shelters. Power was turned off prior to the storm's arrival. Striking Tonga on 12 February, Cyclone Gita brought destructive winds to the capital island of Tongatapu. Initial surveys across the island revealed 119 homes destroyed and another 1,131 damaged, primarily in Nukuʻalofa. Many areas were left without water and power. Many structures lost their roof during the height of the storm. Older structures suffered the greatest damage, including the Tongan Parliament building, built more than 100 years ago, which was flattened by the storm. Fuaʻamotu International Airport sustained damage, along with the domestic terminal, prompting officials to keep the airport closed. Across Tongatapu, 3 people suffered major injuries while another 30 experienced minor injuries. An elderly woman died while trying to find shelter after her home was destroyed. One person died from a heart attack potentially related to the storm in Fuaʻamotu.
On the neighboring island of ʻEua, the storm knocked out power to all residents and caused extensive damage. Similar to Tongatapu, older structures suffered severe damage while newer buildings fared well. Crops were largely destroyed. Fifty-two homes were completely destroyed on the island; eight people suffered injury, including one severe. Total damage were estimated at T$356.1 million (US$164.1 million), including a NZ$20 million (US$14.5 million) damage to the power grid.
Immediately following the storm, a curfew was imposed for all of Tonga. Personnel from His Majesty's Armed Forces rescued people during the storm and began clearing roads at daybreak on 13 February. National Emergency Management Office spokesman Graham Kenna called the storm "the worst situation [he has] been in" during his 30-year career. MP Lord Fusituʻa described the impact as the worst since at least Cyclone Isaac in 1982. India provided US$500,000 humanitarian aid to Tonga under UNOSSF. On 13 February, Australia provided A$350,000 (US$275,000) in emergency supplies via the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to assist more than 2,000 people. Australia also sent humanitarian supplies to the Tongan Red Cross. Two civilian humanitarian specialists were deployed to assist Tonga's National Emergency Management Office. A medical expert also provided assistance to assess health infrastructure. New Zealand provided NZ$750,000 (US$544,000) in assistance.
Fiji.
During Gita's formative states on 6–8 February, the depression brought heavy rain and gusty winds to northern Fiji resulting in some flooding. Accordingly, the FMS issued alerts for these hazards across the affected regions. Rainfall reached in Udu Point on 6 February.
On 13 February, the center of Gita passed roughly south of Ono-i-Lau in the Lau Islands of Fiji. Observations from the island revealed peak sustained winds of with gusts to . Twenty-four hour rainfall reached , greatly contributing to the island experiencing its wettest February on record; the monthly total was . Flooding from tidal surge preceded the core of the cyclone by several hours. Structural damage was reported in Doi Village, including one home that lost its roof. Communications with Ono-i-Lai and nearby Vatoa were disrupted for roughly a day. Across both islands, 10 homes were destroyed and 26 more sustained damage. Many structures sustained roof damage and crops were devastated. Local leaders on Ono-i-Lau called the storm the "worst in living memory". Damage to the nation were at FJ$1.23 million (US$606,000).
New Caledonia.
On 16 February, the New Caledonia branch of Météo-France issued a level 1 hurricane alert for the Isle of Pines, southeast Grande Terre. This was soon raised to level 2, prompting the closure of schools and businesses across the municipality. In advance of the storm, most tourists visiting Isle of Pines were evacuated to Nouméa; however, many stayed to ride out the storm. Municipal buildings were opened to the public as shelters. Domestic flights at Nouméa Magenta Airport were suspended during the storm's passage. Offshore, removal operations of the grounded cargo ship "Kea Trader"—situated over Récif Durand about east of Nouméa—were suspended with workers repositioned to Nouméa. The two broken halves of the ship were ballasted to minimize movement in the expected rough seas. The cyclone ultimately had little effect across the territory; some damage to vegetation and marinas was reported.
Australia.
While located nearly east of Queensland on 17 February, large swells propagating from the cyclone impacted Australia's Pacific beaches. Conditions remained hazardous through 19 February. Surf was largest from Gold Coast to Sydney, with peak swells of at Tweed Heads and at Palm Beach. Surf Life Saving Queensland closed all beaches between North Kirra and Southport. Although most people heeded warnings and closures, some "thrillseekers" surfed and used jet skis. One person required rescue in the Jumpinpin Channel. A surfer and swimmer were pulled from dangerous rip currents at Burleigh and Mooloolaba, respectively. Off Nambucca Heads, New South Wales, one person was pulled out to sea by rip currents on 17 February. Surf Life Saving New South Wales stated that rescue operations shifted to recovery the following day as there had been "a significant amount of time since this gentleman disappeared". Helicopters conducted aerial surveys on 19 February to assist local police and rescuers. Search and rescue operations were ultimately suspended on 21 February without success. Two people were rescued off the coast of Manly when their boat sank amid swells. Throughout New South Wales, authorities conducted dozens of rescues.
New Zealand.
As Cyclone Gita threatened to hit New Zealand as a strong ex-tropical cyclone, New Zealand's MetService issued heavy rain warnings and strong wind warnings covering a wide expanse of the country. Campers, hikers, and boaters in the Marlborough Sounds were told to evacuate, and residents there were warned that communications could be cut off by the storm. Several schools in the region of Nelson were closed, while in the West Coast, schools in the districts of Buller and Grey were closed. Air New Zealand cancelled a number of flights on 20 February.
As Gita bore down on the South Island, bringing floods and strong winds, a state of emergency was eventually declared on 20 February. Total insured losses across New Zealand reached NZ$35.6 million (US$26.1 million). In Taranaki, Gita resulted in NZ$4.5 million (US$3.1 million) worth of damage. A tree fell on a water main near the water treatment plant south of New Plymouth, leaving 10,000 homes without water for 3 days and 26,000 homes on a boil water notice for 7 days.
Other nations.
As Gita's precursor tropical disturbance impacted Vanuatu's Torba province during 6 February, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department warned that heavy rainfall, thunder and lightning would impact the area and advised people to take extra precautions. Additional alerts were raised on 15–16 February as Gita tracked southeast of the nation. Between 8 and 9 February, the system brought strong winds and heavy rain to Wallis and Futuna. Some power outages were reported on Wallis, though overall effects were negligible. On 8 February, weather alerts were issued for Niue as Gita approached from the northeast. The cyclone bypassed the island to the southeast the following day with minimal effects. Sustained winds at Niue International Airport reached with gusts to .

The" Wied-Scala" is an art-house cinema in Neitersen in the Westerwald region of Germany. It was first opened as a normal cinema in 1956. It takes its name from the river Wied, which flows immediately by the cinema building. The foyer of the cinema has a small café, which is supplemented in summer by a beer garden. The arena and balcony offer 110 seats. For events without seating, it can accommodate about 220 people. Since its reopening in 1988, the Wied Scala has established itself as a venue for culture and events covering for a wide variety of themes and, since 1989, it has been regularly received awards for an outstanding film programme at state and federal level. In recent years comprehensive modernisation measures have been carried out to upgrade the video and sound technology, as well as seating and fire protection, in order to cope with the rising demands on infrastructure and safety. In spite of these measures the cinema very largely retains its 1950's décor and original character.

"A or B" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima. It was released as a single by Sony Music Associated Records on October 25, 2017. It was written and composed by Jam Note and arranged by Manaboon. The limited edition of the CD single comes with a DVD including the music video for "A or B" and its making-of. "A or B" was used in televised commercials for Kao's liquid fabric softener "Flair Fragrance", starring actress Satomi Ishihara.
Background.
"A or B" is the first single by Nakashima since the release of her eighth studio album, "Tough", and was released two months following the release of her cover album, "". The single's artwork depicts Nakashima on a white swing in front of a soft pink backdrop. The limited edition artwork has Nakashima in a similar position against a dark gray backdrop. The dueling visuals are meant to represent Nakashima swinging between options "A" and "B"; imagined here as the "rain" and "shine" dispositions of a woman in love.
Critical reception.
"A or B" is a light soulful pop song, following in the same vein as her previous single "Koi o Suru". CDJournal praised Nakashima for her "unstrained and pleasant-sounding" vocal performance. CDJournal critics noted that with her last two singles, Nakashima has been successfully shedding her "diva" image.
Chart performance.
"A or B" debuted at number 38 on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart. The single charted for two consecutive weeks and sold a reported total of 2,000 copies. The song also charted on "Billboard Japan"'s Top Singles Sales charts, also ranking at number 38.

Mary L. Fonseca

Mary L. Fonseca (1915–2005) was a Massachusetts state senator who represented the Second Bristol District from 1953 to 1984. As Assistant Majority Leader, she was the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts Senate.
Fonseca was known as a strong supporter of working women and public education. In her first senate speech, she successfully argued for an end to discrimination against women teachers in Massachusetts public schools.
Early life.
She was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the daughter of Mary Botelho and José Leite, both Portuguese immigrants. Her father owned a small grocery store on the corner of Webster and Alden Streets. After graduating from Durfee High School in 1932, she wanted to go to college but, as she explained in an interview, "as the oldest girl in a family of 12, I had to go right to work." She worked at the Fall River Public Library, and later as a secretary for the U.S. Census Bureau.
Political career.
She first became interested in politics as a teenager, when she accompanied her mother to meetings of the Portuguese-American Civic League. Soon she began taking part in the League's fundraising drives, and organized a Junior Council for young members.
She was elected to the Fall River School Committee in 1945 and served two four-year terms. During her last year on the committee she served as vice chairman. Concerned about rising unemployment in her area, she successfully ran for state senate in 1952, running a low-budget campaign out of her family's modest third-floor apartment. She was the first woman to represent the Second Bristol District in the senate, the first Portuguese-American woman elected to the Massachusetts Senate, and possibly the first Portuguese-American woman to be elected to any legislative seat in the United States. As Assistant Majority Leader (or Majority Whip) from 1973 to 1984, she was also the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts senate.
Fonseca earned a reputation as a champion of women and public education. In her "maiden speech" on the senate floor, she argued in support of a bill ending discrimination against married women teachers:
There are only two bachelors and three women in the Massachusetts State Senate. That means out of 40 senators, 35 of you are going to have to make a determination before we leave here today as to whether or not your wives became less competent the day they married you. When a male teacher gets married, his pay is not lowered, nor are his annual leave and pension rights taken from him, yet there is a double standard where women are concerned. Why?
After having been voted down repeatedly for years, the bill finally passed. Fonseca went on to chair the Senate Committee on Education, and was a strong supporter of Southeastern Massachusetts University (now the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth) and Bristol Community College in Fall River. In 1974 she successfully argued in favor of tax deductions for working mothers' daycare expenses.
Personal life.
She married John C. Fonseca Jr., an insurance company employee, in 1948. The couple had two children, John and Irene. Her husband died in 1970.
She was active in many civic and charitable organizations, including the Business and Professional Women's Foundation, the National Order of Women Legislators, the Portuguese-American Civic League, the Salvation Army Women's Auxiliary, and the Holy Name Women.
Towards the end of her life Fonseca suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She died of a heart attack in the County Gardens Nursing Home in Swansea, Massachusetts. Mary L. Fonseca Elementary School in Fall River is named in her honor.

The Highwaymen (film)

The Highwaymen is a 2019 American period crime drama film directed by John Lee Hancock and written by John Fusco. The film stars Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson as Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, two former Texas Rangers who attempt to track down and apprehend notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde in the 1930s. Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann and William Sadler also star.
The film had been in development hell for many years, with producer Casey Silver looking into the project as early as 2005. Originally pitched by Fusco as a possible Paul Newman and Robert Redford project, the film began development at Universal Pictures but never came to fruition. In February 2018, it was reported Netflix had picked up the rights to the film and that Costner and Harrelson would star. Filming took place later that month and in March, shooting around Louisiana and at several historical sites, including the road where Bonnie and Clyde were killed.
"The Highwaymen" had a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 15, 2019 before being released digitally on March 29, 2019 on Netflix. It received mixed reviews from critics.
Plot.
In 1934, after two years on the run, criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow break several associates out of Texas' Eastham Prison Farm. Texas Department of Corrections Chief Lee Simmons persuades Governor "Ma" Ferguson to hire former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer to track down the criminals. Reluctant to leave retirement and his wife Gladys, Hamer joins the manhunt after the fugitive gang is involved in a devastating shootout in Missouri, and he recruits his former partner, Benjamin Maney Gault.
Information from FBI wiretapping of the fugitives' families leads Hamer and Gault to conclude that Bonnie and Clyde are returning "home" to Dallas. Watching Bonnie's mother's house, they see a man throw a bottle into her yard, which is soon thrown back, but a boy escapes with it. Dismissing the Rangers' theory, the FBI believe the fugitives are in Brownsville. Hamer and Gault meet with Dallas Sheriff "Smoot" Schmid, who introduces them to Deputy Sheriff Ted Hinton, a childhood friend of Bonnie and Clyde who can identify them on sight. The gang kills two policemen in nearby Grapevine; Hamer and Gault investigate the scene and determine that Bonnie has a rabbit, which Hinton suggests is a present for a family member.
The Rangers drive to Oklahoma and question a gas station attendant, who declares his support for the criminals. Hamer assaults the man into admitting the gang passed through en route to a migrant camp, where a local girl confirms the gang stayed. A radio bulletin alerts the Rangers to two more murdered officers but, being outside their jurisdiction, they are barred from passing the police roadblock, which a frustrated Hamer drives around. They continue to Coffeyville, Kansas, correctly guessing that Bonnie and Clyde will stop there for supplies. As the Rangers move in on the fugitives, an adoring crowd surrounds the criminals' car. Hamer and Gault give chase, but Bonnie and Clyde escape through a dirt field.
Learning that Clyde had breakfast in Amarillo, the Rangers return to Dallas to find the rabbit has been delivered to Bonnie's family. Hamer meets Henry Barrow, Clyde's father, who affirms that his son must be stopped. The Rangers have Simmons furlough Wade McNabb, an incarcerated associate of the gang, hoping to draw them out. While Hamer interrogates McNabb at a bar, Gault is threatened in the restroom by thugs sympathetic to the gang, but subdues them. Learning that Bonnie plans to meet a hairdresser the next day, the Rangers surveil her mother's house again. A man throws another bottle into the yard, which is retrieved by the same boy but intercepted by the Rangers; it contains a message that the gang are heading elsewhere. Realizing McNabb warned the gang, the Rangers visit his home and discover him beaten to death.
Simmons recalls Hamer and Gault to Austin, but they return to their theory that "outlaws always go home", predicting that the fugitives are going to Bienville Parish, Louisiana, home of gang member Henry Methvin's father, Ivy. Searching Ivy's house, the Rangers find evidence of the outlaws' recent stay. They join forces with local Sheriff Henderson Jordan and Deputy Prentiss Oakley to confront Ivy; in exchange for his son's safety, he reveals that the gang will soon return. The lawmen are joined by Hinton and Dallas Sheriff's Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Gault tells them of his first deployment with Hamer: they killed a gang of bandits, including a fleeing 13-year-old boy. Ivy informs them the gang is arriving the next day, and the posse prepare an ambush on the road to his house, staging his truck as if it has broken down.
Bonnie and Clyde arrive, stopping to assist Ivy, and Hamer orders them to raise their hands. Instead, the criminals prepare to draw their own weapons, but are gunned down. The bullet-riddled car with Bonnie and Clyde's bodies is towed to Arcadia, Louisiana and mobbed by onlookers. Refusing $1,000 for an interview with the Associated Press, Hamer and Gault drive home.
Production.
Development.
Around 2005, producer Casey Silver began to develop "The Highwaymen", an original pitch from John Fusco that once had Paul Newman and Robert Redford poised to play the veteran Texas Rangers who put an end to the violent robbery spree of Bonnie and Clyde.
The project had been a long-time goal of Fusco's to portray Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the proper light of history. Fusco researched extensively in Texas and became friends with Hamer's son, the late Frank Hamer Jr. By 2013, the project was under development at Universal Pictures.
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was in negotiations to extricate the production from Universal Pictures. At the time of the report, Netflix was in early discussions with Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner for the two lead roles and with John Lee Hancock as director. The script was written by John Fusco. Casey Silver, who had been developing the project while it was at Universal, was set to produce.
On February 12, 2018, it was announced by Netflix that the film had entered production. Hancock was officially confirmed as director, and Harrelson, Costner, and Silver were confirmed as producers. They are set to produce alongside Michael Malone and Rod Lake.
Casting.
Alongside the announcement of the film entering production, it was confirmed that Costner and Harrelson would be playing Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, respectively. In addition, it was announced that Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann, and William Sadler had also joined the cast.
Filming.
Principal photography for the film commenced on February 12, 2018, in New Orleans, Louisiana and was expected to last until April 10, 2018. The production was set to film in other locations around the state including Covington, LaPlace, Hammond, Baton Rouge, and Garyville. On February 21, 2018, filming took place at Laurel Valley Plantation in Thibodaux, Louisiana. The production moved to Donaldsonville, Louisiana where filming took place through February 26, 2018 and where it reportedly shut down an area of the town’s historic district. On March 5, 2018, filming occurred at the Old Louisiana Governor's Mansion in Baton Rouge. Production reportedly caused streets surrounding it to be blocked off for the majority of the day.
From March 21 to 25, 2018, filming took place on Highway 154. Reportedly, the production was reenacting the killing of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow near where the actual event took place. To recreate the scene on what is now an asphalt two-lane highway, the film crew planted trees along the right-of-way and added dirt to cover the blacktop road. Later that month, filming took place on an old U.S. Route 380 bridge that sits southwest of Newcastle, Texas crossing the Brazos River; this bridge was a stand-in for the old Young County Bridge on the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma which had been closed down decades earlier. Principal photography for the film concluded on March 29, 2018 in Shreveport, Louisiana. The production reportedly had a budget of $49 million.
Release.
The film premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 10, 2019 during the South by Southwest film festival, as part of the "Headliners" series of screenings. It then began a limited theatrical release on March 15, 2019 before beginning to stream digitally on March 29, 2019 on Netflix. In April 2019, Netflix reported that 40 million households had watched the film during its first month of release.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Highwaymen" depicts law enforcement's side of the Bonnie and Clyde manhunt -- a story that's unfortunately not quite as entertaining despite its marquee leads." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
The film received a nomination for the Satellite Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film in 2020.

Prior to the formation of the Continental Cup in 1993, the Europa Cup served as the second level of international ski jumping, ranking below the World Cup. Athletes competing in the Europa Cup were usually juniors and jumpers fighting for a spot on their nation's World Cup team. Often some World Cup athletes would also compete in the Europa Cup inbetween World Cup events.
The International Ski Federation considers the last two Europa Cup seasons in 1991/92 and 1992/93 where they competed only in Europe and with only European ski jumpers, as first two Continental Cup seasons. Starting from the 1993/94 season the Continental Cup was officially started with events in North America and Asia and the Europa Cup was absorbed in the new Continental Cup as a result.

Living (Christianity)

In the Church of England a priest was able in the past, by patronage, to hold several preferments at one time. 
This was called a living. The actual work was allocated to a curate at a minimal salary. Authors such as Anthony Trollope highlighted the injustice of this practice and it is no longer permissible.

I'll Be Your Girl

I'll Be Your Girl is the eighth studio album by the American indie rock band The Decemberists, released on March 16, 2018 on Capitol and Rough Trade. Produced by John Congleton, the band experimented with new instrumentation during the album's recording sessions, including several synth-based compositions inspired by New Order and Depeche Mode. The album was preceded by the singles, "Severed" and "Once in My Life".
Writing and composition.
The album's lyrical content was, in part, influenced by the US 2016 presidential election and its immediate aftermath. Vocalist and guitarist Colin Meloy noted: "["I'll Be Your Girl"] celebrates the absurdity of our current predicaments. I think it really is a reflection of my outlook immediately post the 2016 election, where there was immediately this onset of despair. Like real despair. Real depression, and then sort of climbing out of it. Seeing other people feeling the same way, similarly climbing out of their hole and just witnessing events as they came along, rather than with tears. There was almost like an ironic humour but with anger, and those sort of go together. It was about finding the balance between real rage and humour – discovering the wild absurdity in it, but not being blithe."

WarGames (interactive media)

Narratively, the show follows a young group of people that are involved in the hacker culture, attempting to use their skills to create societal change. Interactively, the viewer is presented with several video feeds, representing what each of the characters is watching or doing, and can choose which one to focus on; this will affect how the work is presented to the viewer later, though will otherwise not change the narrative.
Development.
MGM's 1983 film "WarGames" was both a critical and financial success for the distributor. While the studio attempted a sequel, "" in 2008, the work ended up going direct-to-video. In June 2011, MGM announced plans to remake "WarGames". At the time, this move was seen as a way by MGM to capitalize on its highly-successful library of films from the 1980s. Seth Gordon was originally slated to direct with Noah Oppenheim to write the script. In June 2014, Dean Israelite had been hired to produce the work, and with potentially Arash Amel slated to write the screenplay. As late as February 2015, Israelite was still working on the project which was still in its scripting phase, but by April 2015, Israelite had been picked up for producer of "Power Rangers", lead to concern for his participation for "WarGames".
By October 2015, the project had shifted to become an interactive media work, co-produced by MGM and Interlude (the former name of Eko), with plans to release by early 2016. The move was seen as experimental by MGM, as the work would forgo any theatrical release or revenues, though could still be monetized depending on how the interactive work was presented to viewers. They saw an "audience-driven interactive story experience" as a perfect fit for the "WarGames" property. Shortly after this announcement, MGM invested heavily into Interlude, which had raised from investors including MGM, Warner Music Group, Samsung, Sequoia Capital and Intel Capital.
Around March 2016, Interlude hired Sam Barlow as executive creative director and creative lead for the "WarGames" project. Barlow had gained attention in 2015 for his video game "Her Story", which required players to piece together a narrative by assembling segments of video footage in the right order. "Her Story" received critical acclaim on its release. Barlow said of the opportunity with Interlude to work alongside people that wanted to make "personalized, reactive stories with a heightened emotional impact".
By December 2017, MGM announced that the interactive media series would be called "#WarGames" with an anticipated start in early 2018. By February, Eko confirmed that the series would be six episodes long, and would be broadcast with interactivity on its own website, mobile app, Nerdist.com, Steam and on Vudu.
Story.
According to Barlow, their original idea for the narrative was to be similar to the film, in which hackers would stumble upon something that appeared to be a game, but proved to have more a more "nefarious purpose". However, they recognized there would be too much jarring between the live-action and in-game segments, and instead took a different route, by envisioning how a member of the hacker culture would interact. The viewer of the work would be put in place of a hacker, looking at the hacker's computer monitor, showing various streams from cameras, video calls, and other audiovisual elements that they could bring anyone to the forefront at any time. Rather than having the viewer make any explicit decision, the work would instead track what video element had the user's attention, and decide which way the story would go from there. Barlow likened this to trying to listen into conversations at a party: one can hear the conversations as they go on, but to really understand them one must focus on a specific conversation.
With further development of the story, Barlow created a narrative around the character of Kelly, played by Jess Nurse, who is meant to represent "the breadth of modern hacker culture and its humanity". Barlow was able to "take the questions raised by the original movie and ask them again in a world where technology has fundamentally changed our lives" with his script. During development, the show "Mr. Robot" came out, which also focused on the hacker culture, leading Barlow to make sure that they presented accurate scenarios related to hacking within "#WarGames"; they hired security consultants to make sure their hacking scenarios were potentially doable. Further, to distinguish themselves from the more serious tone taken by "Mr. Robot", Barlow aimed his script to be light-hearted and with an optimistic outlook.

Lansing Civil Air Patrol Quonset Huts

The Civil Air Patrol Quonset Huts were three Quonset huts located at 16601 Airport Road in Lansing, Michigan, near Capital Region International Airport. The huts were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and are part of the Historic American Engineering Record. The huts are missing and presumed demolished.
History.
These Quonset hits were manufactured by the Butler Manufacturing Company and shipped to Lansing in 1941. They were set up at this location in November, 1941 to house the newly established 9622nd USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. Soon after, the Civil Air Patrol was established, and the Lansing unit began using the huts. For the remainder of World War II, the Lansing Quonset huts were used as a pilot training facility for both the Civil Air Patrol and the USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. The three huts were used continually after the war until 1958, when they were dismantled and put into storage in response to a perceived military threat to the airport. However, the huts were put back into service in 1963, and were used until at least the early 1990s, despite planned demolition in the 1980s.
However, by 1995, the huts were deemed as airport hazards by the Federal Aviation Administration and vacated. Demolition was scheduled at that time.
Description.
The three Quonset huts sat side by side. All three were constructed from prefabricated corrugated steel panels placed horizontally over arched steel ribs and purloins. The huts were eighteen by forty-eight feet, with a center height of eleven feet. Each hut had a single door on the end, and eight windows, four on each side, measuring 31 by 39 inches. The windows were hinged at the top of the frame and open from the bottom.

The Organisation of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) is an international non-profit organization with European Economic Interest Grouping status. It was created in 1979 to promote greater cooperation among European cancer centres and institutes. The head office of the organisation is located in Brussels at the University Foundation.
Mission, History, and Background of OECI.
OECI's mission is to provide all European cancer patients with information and healthcare to fight their specific cancer type. To do this, OECI has relied on its network of almost 100 institutions across Europe to help them reach their goals.
In analogy with the NCI's network of designated comprehensive and clinical cancer centres (see NCI-designated Cancer Center), OECI has developed an Accreditation and Designation Program. The goal is to improve the organization and teamwork between cancer centres around Europe.
The OECI is an organization that prides itself on a quality-based approach. The OECI is also recognised as the only European process specifically designed to unite and provide services for cancer centres. Adding to its list of achievements, the OECI program obtained ISQua Accreditation in 2017. ISQua is the umbrella organization responsible for the Joint Commission International accreditation and other international accreditation schemes.
OECI is the main European network of accredited cancer centers on a European scale. It plays a role in helping EU Member State authorities to organize their cancer healthcare systems.

Miniature Train at Monarch Park

The Miniature Train at Monarch Park was a gauge miniature railway at Oil City, Pennsylvania around 1901. 
Operation.
The park’s Miniature Train was hauled by a steam locomotive, which was built like a standard trunk line steam locomotive. The locomotive and its tender were scale models, the passenger cars were open-air. In making its rounds, it stopped periodically to replenish coal and water. Among the engineers were Charlie Thomas, Dick O’Neil, and a person of short stature named George Hawks, who was very popular with his passengers. The trains ran on a circular track laid with T-rails spiked to miniature sleepers.
Locomotive.
The lilliputian locomotive was made around 1901 by the Armitage-Herschell Company in North Tonawanda, New York, when miniature railways were coming into favour. Their locomotives could pull up to 10 passenger cars, having seating capacity for 40 children or 20 
adults. The locomotive was a facsimile of the regular type of passenger steam locomotives.

John A. Gilmour (born May 17, 1993) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently playing for HC CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).
Playing career.
Prior to joining Providence College, Gilmour played in the United States Hockey League for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders and Gilmour Academy. It was while he was playing for the Roughriders that Gilmour committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for Providence College.
Gilmour was drafted 198th overall in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Calgary Flames. The Flames did not offer him a contract and he continued playing for Providence College.
On August 18, 2016, Gilmour signed a two-year, $1.85 million entry-level contract with the New York Rangers. Gilmour spent the first half of the season in the AHL, and was named to the 2018 AHL all-star game. He made his NHL debut in a 4–3 win over the Flames on February 9, 2018. Gilmour recorded his first NHL goal on February 13, 2018, in a 3–2 loss to the Minnesota Wild. Gilmour became the first New York Rangers rookie defenseman to score an overtime goal when he scored a goal 1:22 into overtime on February 28, 2018, against the Vancouver Canucks.
While attending the Rangers training camp, Gilmour was reassigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack to begin the 2018–19 season. During the season, Gilmour set a Wolf Pack franchise record for goals by a defenseman in a season with 20, and was named an AHL All-star for the second consecutive season.
On July 1, 2019, Gilmour left the Rangers as a free agent to sign a one-year, one-way $700,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres. He began the 2019–20 season, with the Sabres as a healthy scratch before he was assigned on a conditioning stint to AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. He appeared in 4 games with the Sabres, going scoreless.
As a free agent from the Sabres, and with the 2020–21 North American season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilmour belatedly signed a contract abroad in agreeing to a one-year deal with Russian club, HC CSKA Moscow of the KHL, on December 14, 2020.

Ministry of the Navy (Turkey)

The Ministry of the Navy () was a former government ministry in Turkey. During the first two governments of Turkey the naval affairs were managed by a directorate. But on 22 November 1924 during the formation of the 3rd government of Turkey a new ministry was established for the naval affairs. However soon the ministry was blamed for a chain of accidents during the maintenance of the battle cruiser Yavuz. The minister was put on trial and the ministry was abolished at the end of the 4th government of Turkey on 1 November 1927. The responsibility of the ministry was transferred to the Ministry of National Defense. 
Aftermath.
On 6 July 2011, during the formation of the 61st government of Turkey the name of the ministry of "Transport and Communication" was changed to Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication, but this ministry is responsible only in civilian maritime affairs.

Eric C. Tostrud

Eric Christian Tostrud (born 1965) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.
Education and career.
Eric C. Tostrud, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, was born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1965.  He received his B.A. in Political Science and Speech "cum laude" from St. Olaf College in 1987.  Judge Tostrud received his J.D. "summa cum laude" from William Mitchell College of Law in 1990, and he was admitted to the Minnesota Bar in October 1990.  He clerked for Judge Edward J. Devitt of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota from 1990 to 1992, and for Judge George E. MacKinnon of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1992.
Judge Tostrud spent his entire career as a practicing lawyer with the Minneapolis firm Lockridge Grindal Nauen.  He was an associate with the firm from 1992 to 1997, a partner from 1998 through 2014, and of counsel from 2015 through his appointment to the federal bench.  During his time with the firm, Judge Tostrud maintained a complex litigation practice concentrated almost exclusively in the federal courts primarily in the health care, insurance coverage, fraud, and financial services fields.  His pro bono service included representing military veterans before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.
While in practice, Judge Tostrud taught often as an adjunct professor at William Mitchell College of Law and at the University of Minnesota Law School. In 2015, Judge Tostrud began teaching law full time as a Distinguished Practitioner in Residence, first at William Mitchell and then at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.  Judge Tostrud's areas of teaching included legal writing, the federal courts, federal jurisdiction, federal civil procedure, complex litigation, electronic discovery, and the business of lawyering. Judge Tostrud's service as a member of the Mitchell Hamline faculty ended with his judicial appointment.
Federal judicial service.
On February 12, 2018, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Tostrud to an undetermined seat on the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On February 15, 2018, his nomination was sent to the Senate. Tostrud was nominated to the seat on the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota vacated by Judge Donovan W. Frank, who assumed senior status on October 31, 2016. On April 11, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On May 10, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by a voice vote. On September 6, 2018, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote. He received his judicial commission on September 10, 2018.
Community involvement.
Judge Tostrud has served his community in a variety of ways.  Among the more significant points of service, he has been active in his church, Augustana Lutheran Church in West St. Paul, Minnesota, serving on council and as congregational president, among other activities.  He served as a trustee of William Mitchell College of Law from 2006 to 2015.  He founded the Kloeck-Jenson Endowment for Peace and Justice Studies at St. Olaf College in 2001, a program that continues to fund student opportunities for social entrepreneurship and public service.  Judge Tostrud also spent considerable time volunteering and coaching in the West St. Paul Area Youth Hockey Association.

Love in a Cold Climate (1980 TV series)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Love in a Cold Climate is a 1980 British television series produced by Thames Television. It is an adaptation of the Nancy Mitford novels "The Pursuit of Love" (1945) and "Love in a Cold Climate" (1949), set between 1924 and 1940, with a screenplay adaptation by Simon Raven. It was originally broadcast on the ITV network in eight episodes. The series starred Lucy Gutteridge, Rosalyn Landor, Michael Aldridge, Judi Dench, Vivian Pickles, and Jean-Pierre Cassel.
Production.
The filming of the serial has been described as "most uncharacteristically relaxed" for the actors, as it had been scheduled during what proved to be a long-running dispute between ITV and the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians union. At first, there was a work-to-rule, and the actors were not called until 11 am, with filming ending at about 4 pm. The dispute then escalated into a full strike, and filming was abandoned, with the actors being paid a retainer until it could be resumed.

Junior Firpo

Héctor Junior Firpo Adames (born 22 August 1996), known as Junior Firpo or simply Junior, is a professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Leeds United. Mainly a left-back, he can also play as a centre-back or right-back.
Club career.
Real Betis.
Born in Santo Domingo, Junior moved to Benalmádena, Málaga, Andalusia at the age of six and joined Real Betis' youth setup in June 2014, aged 18, from Puerto Malagueño. He made his senior debut with the reserves on 15 February 2015, starting in a 1–1 home draw against Granada B for the Segunda División B championship.
Definitely promoted to the B-side ahead of the 2015–16 season, Junior appeared regularly during the season, which ended in relegation. On 17 April 2016 he scored his first senior goal, netting the third in a 4–0 away win over Algeciras.
On 1 August 2017, after spending the whole pre-season with the main squad, Junior renewed his contract until 2021. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut the following 12 February, starting in a 1–0 away defeat of Deportivo La Coruña, becoming the first Dominican Republic-born player to have ever featured in La Liga.
Junior scored his first professional goal on 17 March 2018, netting the first in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol. On 19 August, after being promoted to the main squad, he agreed to a contract extension until 2023.
Barcelona.
On 4 August 2019, Junior signed a five-year deal with Barcelona for €18 million 
plus €12 million in add-ons. He made his debut three weeks later in a 5–2 home win over his former club Betis, playing the last nine minutes in place of Rafinha. On 28 September, Junior scored his first goal for Barcelona and the second goal against Getafe in 2–0 win. On 27 November, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 3–1 group stage victory over Borussia Dortmund.
On 13 February 2021, Firpo scored his second (and last) goal for Barça in a 5–1 home win over Alavés.
Leeds United.
On 6 July 2021, Firpo signed a four-year deal with Premier League club Leeds United for a fee of €15 million plus add-ons, with Barcelona reserving rights to 20% of his future sales. He is expected to replace Ezgjan Alioski at the left back role after Alioski's contract expired, and made his debut for the club in that position on 14 August in the second half of the season opener at Old Trafford, where he came on as a tactical substitute for Rodrigo in a 5–1 loss.
International career.
Despite being born in the Dominican Republic, he has spent the majority of his life in Spain and continues to hold citizenship for both countries. On 9 October 2015, he played the entire second half of a 0–6 non-FIFA friendly loss for the Dominican Republic senior national team against the Brazil Olympic team.
On 31 August 2018, Junior was called up to the Spain under-21 team for two 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying matches against Albania and Northern Ireland. He made his debut on 7 September, starting in a 3–0 win against the former.

Mehli Irani

Mehli Dinshaw Irani (26 June 1930 – 3 April 2021) was an Indian cricketer, who played as a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Irani played in the Kanga Cricket League for over 50 years. He made one appearance for Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, and also played club cricket for Bombay University and Parsee Cyclists.
Career.
Irani was a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He captained the St. Xavier's College cricket team, and later played club cricket for Bombay Gymkhana and Parsee Cyclists. At Bombay Gymkhana, Irani played alongside Rohan Gavaskar, the son of Test cricketer Sunil Gavaskar.
In December 1951, Irani played for Bombay University in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the match, he played alongside Madhusudan Patil, the father of Test cricketer Sandeep Patil. In the 1952–53 season, Irani captained a Bombay University team that included five future Test match players: (Nari Contractor, Naren Tamhane, Chandrakant Patankar, Gundibail Sunderam and Ramnath Kenny). In one match captained by Irani, five catches were dropped in the opening over. The Bombay University team won that year's Rohinta Barion Trophy, after defeating Delhi in the final. In 1953, Irani made his only appearance in the Ranji Trophy, playing for Bombay in a match against Baroda. He was out lbw to Vijay Hazare for 17. Irani's team-mate Shishir Hattangadi said that Irani was disappointed to have only ever played one Ranji Trophy match.
Irani played in the Kanga Cricket League, a monsoon season cricket tournament, for 57 years, starting in 1949. He described the difficulty of batting in the tournament: "A person who gets 30 or 40 runs is as good as getting a 50 or a 100 when you play on a dry wicket, the uncertainty of the wicket added to Kanga League’s beauty." He played for Parsee Cyclists, and took over the captaincy of the side from Nari Contractor. In 1991, Irani stumped Sachin Tendulkar in a Kanga League match. Irani played as a wicket-keeper even in his 60s, before retiring from cricket at the age of 69.
Personal life and death.
At Bombay Cricket Club, Irani was nicknamed the "centre table man". Irani was married to Dhanu, and they had two daughters. He continued to attend Bombay Gymkhana cricket matches even after his retirement, until he moved to Dubai in December 2020 to be near one of his daughters. Irani died on 3 April 2021 in Dubai, and his death was announced by the Mumbai Cricket Association. His funeral was held the next day.

Enamel fracture

An enamel fracture, or chip, is a complete fracture of the tooth enamel without the involvement of the dentine and pulp. A fracture occurs when a tooth contacts a hard object with enough force to break a section of enamel. Chips form with minimal plastic deformation since enamel is strong but brittle. A fracture typically occurs as an irregular break on the occlusal edge of the enamel, and is therefore different to other forms of tooth wear that leave smooth surfaces. Pulp sensibility testing is recommended to confirm pulpal health. Treatment depends on the size of the fractures. If a tooth fragment is still available, it can be bonded to the tooth. For small or minor fractures, it can be smoothed to remove rough margins and edges. For a larger or major fractures, dental composite resin can be used to mask the defective enamel for aesthetic purpose. In archaeological samples enamel fractures can give insight into the diet and behaviour of past populations.

Reckless Love (Cory Asbury album)

Reckless Love is the second solo studio album by American Christian worship musician Cory Asbury, and his third album overall. Bethel Music released the album on January 26, 2018, his first full-length release with the label. Asbury worked with Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury in the production of the album.
Preceded by the release of the album's popular title track as a single in October 2017, "Reckless Love" was released to critical acclaim, while achieving commercial success with a No. 1 debut on "Billboard"'s Christian Albums chart in the United States, as well as the OCC's Official Christian &amp; Gospel Albums Chart in the United Kingdom, with top 100 mainstream chart entries in Australia, Switzerland and the United States. "Reckless Love" won the Worship Album of Year at the 49th Dove Awards in 2018. It was nominated for Top Christian Album at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards.
Background.
Cory Asbury started out as a worship leader with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City from 2005 and appeared on several IHOP-KC releases. He released a duet album with Matt Gilman titled "Holy" in 2008, followed by his solo debut called "Let Me See Your Eyes" in 2009 via the IHOP-affiliated label, Forerunner Music. In 2012, Cory Asbury moved from Kansas City to Colorado Springs, Colorado to join New Life Church as worship pastor where he served as a worship leader with New Life Worship and Desperation Band. He featured on New Life Worship's "Strong God" (2013), and co-wrote some songs on "Banner" (2014) as a Desperation Band member.
Asbury joined the Bethel Music collective in May 2015 and made his first appearance on a Bethel Music collective release performing the song "Son of God" on their eighth live album, "Have It All" (2016). In December 2016, he moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan to serve as a worship pastor of Radiant Church. After a nine-year solo hiatus, he released "Reckless Love" in January 2018, an album that is described as "a whole-hearted telling of an essential story in Scripture: a Father's desire for connection with the ones he made, knows, and relentlessly loves." The album is said to have been inspired by the lessons that Asbury learnt in his journey from boyhood to manhood.
Artwork and packaging.
In a post on Bethel Music's Instagram page regarding the cover art for the album and the single, Cory Asbury expressed that he had to become a father to learn how to become a son. He shared that the cover of the single "Reckless Love" signified an introduction to his personal story, saying "The beginning. The genesis. An innocent little boy with goofy, spiky hair and not a care in the world. Just a little kid. A son. No worries. No wounds. Carefree and confident in the perfect little world my parents provided for me." Asbury then stated that the album cover denotes his life coming full circle, saying:
On the journey from boyhood to manhood there were a million cracks in the road. But somehow the grace of God swooped in with wings otherworldly and carried me safely over each one. And finally, those mighty wings set me down in a broad place. Now I'm a father to my own little boy. And somehow, in so becoming, I'm a little child again. Fully free and fully alive in my Father's eyes. The brokenness didn't break me. No, we rewrote the story in crimson ink. And I dance again like a little boy. Nothing between us. Innocent and free just like You always wanted. And I realize I've always been the dream of Your heart. A son.
— Cory Asbury, via Bethel Music's Instagram feed
Promotion.
Bethel Music announced the commencement of the album's pre-order period on January 5, 2018, with "Endless Alleluia", "Reckless Love" and "Water and Dust" being released as promotional singles as they were availed for instant download.
Singles.
Cory Asbury released "Reckless Love" via Bethel Music on October 27, 2017 as the lead single from the album. A version of "Reckless Love" adapted for radio airplay was released in digital format on January 5, 2018. Three weeks prior to its impact date, the song was already spinning on radio stations across the United States.
Critical reception.
Reviewing for Eden.co.uk, Aaron Lewendon concluded that "Through "Reckless Love", God's strength is liked not to a celestial force, but to the limitless resolve of the most loving of parents. It's a love that conquers death, that brings freedom, and that brings the one thing we've been searching all our lives for; security." Timothy Yap, reviewing the album for Hallels whilst rating it three-point-five-out-of-five, believes that "the album abounds with great worship moments." AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung described the album as presenting a "passionate and yearning message with uplifting midtempo numbers that recall secular bands like Coldplay, OneRepublic, and The Script." Jay Wright of NewReleaseToday concluded in his review of the album: "Every word and every line Cory Asbury sings in "Reckless Love" resonates with the warm and gentle love of God. Cory describes our Father as One who is passionate and will stop at nothing to win our hearts. Serene melodies mix with stunning harmonies to bring an album that invites the listener to sit back and simply receive God's unending love. "Reckless Love" has certainly been worth the wait!"

Santa Maria Avvocata

Santa Maria Avvocata is a Catholic church located at the end of Via Avvocata in Piazza Dante in the Historic Center of Naples, Italy.
History.
The church building dates back to the 16th century, when the Carmelite priest Alessandro Mollo built a church with a small convent. By the end of the century, Cardinal Alfonso Gesualdo, the Archbishop of Naples, had purchased the complex and raised it to the status of a parish church.
In the subsequent centuries, the church was remodeled in the Baroque style common to many of the churches in Naples. The facade was re-designed by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro with stucco.
The center of the parish was then moved from Santa Maria Avvocata to the nearby Church of San Domenico Soriano.
The nave is bright and full of decorations and festoons. Its plan is rectangular and the high altar is made of multicolored marble. The design of the interior is similar to that of the nearby Church of Sant'Antonio a Tarsia. Several frescoes inside are by Luca Giordano and Vincenzo Galloppi.
On the left side of the facade is a door that leads to the quarters of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament of Avvocata, where there are frescoes by Andrea dell'Asta and Francesco Solimena.

Geissorhiza melanthera

Geissorhiza melanthera is a small perennial plant of 14–18 cm (5½–7 in) high that is assigned to the Iridaceae. It survives the dry southern summer through storage of its resources in a corm. The stem carries two or three erect, sticky leaves of up to 18 cm (7 in) long, H-shaped in cross-section. This species blooms with six to twelve bilaterally symmetrical flowers, in a spike. Sometimes the spike has one side branch with fewer flowers. Each flower has six pale beige perianth lobes, a purple-red ring around a purple red tube and three blackish stamens. Each flower is subtended by two 1¼–2¼ cm (½–⅞ in) long green bracts. This species was found flowering from the end of September till mid October. It is an endemic of the western slopes of the Piketberg mountains in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Taxonomy.
The species was described in a publication in 2013 by South African botanists Peter Goldblatt and John Manning. It belongs to the section "Engysiphon".
Ecology.
The bee fly "Megapalpus capensis" is the only species that has been observed visiting the flowers of "Geissorhiza melanthera". Remarkably, "G. melanthera" is the only Iridaceae known to be pollinated by a bee fly. "Megapalpus capensis" is also known to visit several "Pelargonium" species, all of which have white, cream or pale pink petals with blackish markings and mostly dark anthers. "Gorteria diffusa" that is visited by the same bee fly species often has dark spots on some or all of its yellow or orange ray florets, that closely mimic the bee fly's appearance. The species grows in deep sandy soils, on gentle slopes facing south, in an ecosystem called Leipoldtville Sand Fynbos.
Conservation.
"Geissorhiza melanthera" is known from only two locations, one of which has been requested to allow to reclaim it for the cultivation of rooibos. It is therefore considered endangered.

<doc id="56570683" url="?curid=56570683" title="CREATES Act">
CREATES Act

The CREATES Act of 2019 is a U.S. federal law which includes measures intended to reduce prices and increase the competitiveness of generic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally standalone legislation sponsored by Patrick Leahy in the Senate and David Cicilline in the House of Representatives, those bills were incorporated into the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 which was signed into law on December 20, 2019.
The bill had been drafted in some form since 2016. Measures in the bill are intended to prevent pharmaceutical companies from blocking companies from producing generic drugs by refusing to sell drugs to the new companies, or taking advantage of safety regulation to block new drugs. Generic drug companies would be allowed to sue to gain access to samples. The resulting impact of the bill would be a reduction in generic drug prices via increased market competition.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would save $3.8 billion over a 10-year period by reducing drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid.
History.
The bill was intended for inclusion in the February 2018 budget package. However, as a result of lobbying from pharmaceutical companies and other opposition, the provision was removed from the final budget provision.
Support.
The bill had support from conservatives including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. Liberal Democrat senators have also voiced support of the bill including Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. The bill was also supported by prominent think tanks including conservative groups Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, as well as liberal think tanks Families USA and Public Citizen.
Public surveys found 75% of Americans said the President and Congress "need to do more" to reduce drug prices, while around 10% of those surveyed said that they think that they have done enough.
Opposition.
The CREATES Act was opposed by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). Opponents said the bill was not good solution to the issue of Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy with Elements to Assure Safe Use, or "REMS with ETASU" processes. These programs can include physician training, patient registries or follow-up testing.

In particular, JMM strives to fight any foreign elements that have the potential to disrupt the racial harmony and unity in Malaysia. JMM also aims to uphold the integrity and leadership of professionals in managing the country's assets.
Prior to 2011, JMM had struggled to find relevance in the current Malaysian political and socio-economic climate and it was through the extraordinary efforts of Azwanddin that key issues promoted by JMM such as the anti-corruption stance, received prominence in the Malaysian sphere.
JMM began to receive significant public and media attention due to its anti-LGBTQ stance since 2011. As a devout Muslim and the president of JMM, Azwanddin voiced his concerns on the influence of LGBTQ in youth, the rise of HIV diagnosis among these communities and the resulting breakdown of marriages due to one partner being a closeted gay or lesbian. Of course, these views do not resonate with the current Malaysian and global liberal views on sexuality and JMM's stance on LGBTQ remains a controversy to these parties.
Cerebral Palsy.
Cerebral palsy is close to Azwanddin's heart as one of his sons suffers from this condition. As a member of the Family Support Group of Cerebral Palsy at Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Azwanddin provides his whole-support towards the cause.
Youth Empowerment.
Azwanddin believes that youth is important for the Malaysia's development and in 2017, he became the patron of Rojak United - a voluntary youth engagement and data-driven entity focusing on apolitical civic issues concerning youth.
Awards.
Azwanddin was awarded with "Darjah Indera Mahkota" which carried a "Datoship" title from the Sultan of Pahang in October 2016. In 2018, he was conferred the Malaysian Civil Defence Force (APM) Honorary Colonel Award

Santa Maria Assunta, Settignano

Santa Maria Assunta is a Roman Catholic parish church located in Settignano, a frazione of Florence in the region of Tuscany, Italy.
Description.
A church at this site was originally founded in the 12th century, but underwent a reconstruction in 1518. In 1595, two naves were added under the direction of Alessandro di Francesco Bandini. Among the ancient Florentine families who patronized the church were the Alessandri, Alamanni, Giugni, and Falconieri. The external facade is plain with only an early 16th-century terracotta with a "Virgin and child with young St John". Also in 14th century, a series of facial masks are embedded in walls.
The interior contains a fresco of the "Resurrection" by Maso da San Friano; in the chapel of the Holy Sacrament is a "Last Supper" (1615) by Andrea Commodi. The church also has frescoes (1593) by Santi di Tito also with a statue of Santa Lucia. The main altar has a 15th century crucifix and the apse cupola frescoes were painted by Pier Dandini. A terracotta "Madonna and Child with Angels" by Andrea della Robbia is housed in the church. It also houses a baptismal font (1745), a 15th century ciborium, and a wooden pulpit (1602) whose design is attributed to Bernardo Buontalenti and sculpture to Gherardo Silvani. The church once had paintings by Cigoli.
Adjacent to the church is the Oratory of the Holy Trinity, with frescoes of the "Adoration of the Infant Jesus" by a pupil of Desiderio da Settignano. The piazza of the church has a statue dedicated to Niccolò Tommaseo by the sculptor Leopoldo Costoli.

Action of 2 January 1783

The action of 2 January 1783 was a minor naval battle that took place in the Caribbean Sea during the last stages of the American War of Independence. Severe fighting between a Royal Navy frigate HMS "Magicienne" and a French frigate "Sibylle" went on for nearly two hours, but in that time both frigates were reduced to wrecks.
Events.
Background.
Captain Thomas Graves was in command of HMS "Magicienne" and was part of the British blockade off Cap-François, Saint-Domingue by the Royal Naval Jamaica station.
Off Cap-François into the open sea, a French convoy was sighted by HMS "Endymion". At 0630 the "Endymion" made a signal that the convoy was French. The French convoy had sailed from Cap-François on 27 December 1782 carrying goods and money to Chesapeake Bay. A ship of the convoy had strayed and steered toward the British ship. At 0900 the "Endymion" came up with her and captured what turned out to be the "Celerity", a rich prize valued at 20,000 Francs. Meanwhile, the "Magicienne" came up to assist in shifting the prisoners and goods. At 0930 "Endymion" signalled "Magicienne" to chase to the northeast. Kergariou-Locmaria decided to steer toward the British in order to draw them away from the convoy and signalled the convoy to continue on its course.
Action.
Graves then set about clearing his ship for action. Shortly after, the three leewardmost of the French vessels bore away and followed the French convoy. The French warships raised their colours and prepared to give battle.
At 1230 the "Magicienne" closed up with the smaller ship, the French sloop "Railleur" of 14 guns, and a short action took place. After having fired two broadsides into the sloop, the French frigate "Sibylle" dropped back to assist the struggling "Railleur", and "Magicienne" moved away. "Sibylle" was rated at 600 tons and mounted twenty-six 12-pounders and six 6-pounders. She had been coppered and was a fast-sailing frigate. She had a crew of 271 men under the Comte de Kergariou-Locmaria. "Magicienne" sailed on and soon got on the port quarter of the "Sybille". The guns were practically muzzle to muzzle as men hurled shot by the hand and frequently at each other through the port holes with half pikes and gun rammers to distract each other from firing.
At 1415 the "Magicienne" had nearly silenced the "Sybille’"s fire and the British began to hope and expect that the French would soon surrender. Then, a French shot brought down "Magicienne"’s mizzen and fore-topmast. The wreck fell clear of the "Sybille" and she fell astern. Just after "Magicienne"’s masts fell, a broadside from the British ship cleared "Sybille"’s forecastle and killed eleven men. Kergariou was struck down on the quarterdeck and his men thought he was dead for some time but he was only wounded. Lieutenant de vaisseau Charles Gabriel Morel d'Escures, the second in command, continued the action.
About 1420 the "Magicienne’"s fore and main masts went overboard. "Sybille" now made off as "Endymion" and "Emerald" were seen to approach. "Magicienne" was unable to do anything except fire every available gun into her stern. The action had lasted for an hour and forty-five minutes.
Aftermath.
The "Magicienne" was towed by "Endymion" and "Emerald" and went to Jamaica a fortnight later. The only prize, the "Celerity", never made port and was lost on a rock on 9 January off the island of Heneaga. The "Sybille" had been severely damaged and was captured on 22 January 1783 by HMS "Hussar" under Thomas McNamara Russell. Thomas Graves later produced two engravings of the battle, one representing its beginning, and the other its end.

Francis Erskine Loch

Admiral Francis Erskine Loch (April 1788–13 February 1868) was a senior commander in the Royal Navy during the early 19th century. He served as naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.
Life.
He was born in April 1788 in Drylaw House north of Edinburgh (now within the city boundary) the son of George Loch (1749–1788) and his wife Mary Adam, daughter of John Adam of the Adam family of architects.
He entered the Royal Navy on 1 September 1799 aged eleven as a cabin boy under Captain Andrew Todd on in the Mediterranean with the fleet of Lord Keith. On 17 March 1800 Loch narrowly escaped death when the ship was destroyed by fire and blew up killing 673 men off the Italian coast near Leghorn. Loch was one of the few survivors. Loch served as a midshipman aboard , aad . He was present at the blockade of Genoa in May 1800 aboard "Minotaur". Still with Lord Keith's fleet, he joined under Captain John Stewart. He was placed on the island of Rhodes overseeing the equipping of gunboats bound for Egypt and Lake Mareotis early in 1801. He took part in the landings at Aboukir Bay and was among the party that cut out a Greek vessel from under the guns of the castle overlooking the bay. He then joined and then until November 1801 before transferring back to "Foudroyant". He returned home in 1802.
From May 1803 to 1805 he served under his cousin, Captain Adam on the captured French frigate in the North Sea and the English Channel. On "Chiffonne" he saw major action on 10 June 1805 when "Chiffonne" was among the Royal Navy vessels that drove two French corvettes and 15 gun-vessels ashore at Fecamp. The French warships had been escorting 14 transports. In December 1805, he transferred to with Captain Charles Adam. In January 1806 he was promoted to lieutenant on under Rear Admiral Charles Stirling. His most important action in this period was on (the replacement ship to the earlier one of that name), at the blockade of Rio de la Plata. He stayed with "Queen Charlotte" until his promotion to captain.
His first command was on in 1812. He moved to in 1815, and in 1821. In the latter he served in the East Indies and Persian Gulf, acting as the senior officer for this zone. His last active service was from June to September 1839 on in the Mediterranean.
He was invalided out of active service in the summer of 1839. From September 1839 to September 1841 he was commander of HMS "Victory", not the famous ship, but a guard-ship placed at Portsmouth. In 1847 he was made naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria (a prestigious but non-active role). Loch then underwent several promotions, but without command: rear admiral (1850); vice admiral (1857); admiral (1860).
He retired to Edinburgh in 1860, living at 22 George Square as neighbour to Reverend Patrick Clason. He died in Cheltenham on 13 February 1868.
Family.
Loch's had several important family connections: great grandfather- William Adam; great uncle – Robert Adam; uncle – William Adam of Blair Adam; cousin – Admiral Sir Charles Adam; nephew – Captain Granville Gower Loch RN 
In 1822 he was married to Jesse Robertson in Edinburgh. Jesse was the daughter of Major Robertson, Barrack-Master-General of North Britain. Their known children were:
Francis' children included Major General Granville George Loch (1870–1950)
Memorabilia.
His diary and sketch-books are held at the National Archive in Kew.

Nuclear shaped charge

Nuclear shaped charges refers to nuclear weapons that focus the energy of their explosion into certain directions, as opposed to a spherical explosion. Edward Teller referred to such concepts as third-generation weapons, the first generation being the atom bomb and the second the H-bomb.
The basic concept has been raised on several occasions, with the first known references being part of the Project Orion nuclear-powered spacecraft project in the 1960s. This used beryllium oxide to convert the X-rays released by a small bomb into longer wavelength radiation, which explosively vaporized a tamper material, normally tungsten, causing it to carry away much of the bomb's energy as kinetic energy in the form of tungsten plasma. The same concept was explored as a weapon in the Casaba/Howitzer proposals.
The ideas were explored by Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Studies and Tests.
Project Orion in the 1960s envisioned the use of nuclear shaped charges for propulsion. The nuclear explosion would turn a tungsten plate into a jet of plasma that would then hit the drive pusher plate. About 85% of the bomb's energy could be directed into the target as plasma, albeit with a very wide cone angle of 22.5 degrees. A 4,000 ton spacecraft would use 5 kiloton charges, and a 10,000 ton spacecraft would use 15 kiloton charges. Orion also researched the possibility of nuclear shaped charges being used as weapons in space warfare. These weapons would have yields of a few kilotons, could convert about 50% of that energy into a plasma jet with a velocity of 280 kilometers per second, and could theoretically get beam angles as low as 0.1 radians (5.73 degrees), quite wide but considerably narrower than the propulsion unit.
The nuclear shaped charge concept was also studied extensively in the 1980s as part of Project Prometheus, along with bomb-pumped lasers. Using a combination of explosive wave-shaping and "gun-barrel" design, up to 5% of a small nuclear bomb could reportedly be converted into kinetic energy driving a beam of particles with a beam angle of 0.001 radians (0.057 degrees), far more concentrated than the earlier-proposed plasma jet, though this decreases to 1% efficiency at 50 kilotons (half a kiloton of energy in the beam) and efficiency suffers greatly at even higher yields. There has only been one known nuclear shaped charge test, conducted in 1985 as part of Operation Grenadier. During the test, codenamed 'Chamita', the intent was to use a nuclear detonation to accelerate a one kilogram mass of tungsten at one hundred kilometers per second, in the form of small particles focused in a cone-shaped beam. The test succeeded in propelling one kilogram of tungsten/molybdenum particles to seventy kilometers per second, about 0.59 tons of kinetic energy. As the yield of the detonated nuclear device was 8 kilotons, this came out to only 0.007% efficiency.
Princeton nuclear physicist Dan L. Fenstermacher stated that there is a fundamental problem associated with the Casaba Howitzer concept that becomes dire at higher yields: a good portion of the bomb's energy inevitably becomes black-body radiation, which would quickly overtake the propelled mass. This poses the risk that most of the particles will be vaporized or even ionized, rendering them useless for dealing damage to the target. He concluded: "The NKEW concept is thus one that may "require" subkiloton explosives to be feasible... Whatever the case may be, it is clear that demonstrating a rush of hypervelocity pellets from a nuclear blast, while perhaps impressive, in no way guarantees that a useful weapon will ever be derived from this concept."

I Need You (Paris Hilton song)

"I Need You" is a song recorded by American socialite Paris Hilton. Heiress Records released it as a digital download on February 14, 2018, (Valentine's Day). Michael Green produced "I Need You" and co-wrote it with Hilton and Simon Wilcox. A version of the song leaked in 2010, but Hilton said she re-recorded portions of the vocals and instrumental as a dedicate to her then-fiancée Chris Zylka. It is a doo-wop and pop ballad that features holiday-related puns about love. Green based the single's style on 1950's music; critics found it to be a departure from Hilton's previous pop and dance-oriented releases.
"I Need You" was praised by critics, partially for Hilton's decision to experiment with a different musical genre. It peaked at number 31 on the Dance Club Songs "Billboard" chart, Hilton's fifth appearance on it. A music video, directed by Zylka, was released on February 14, 2018, through Hilton's official YouTube account. Hilton said Marilyn Monroe's performance of "I Wanna Be Loved by You" and Jessica Rabbit inspired the video. In it, Hilton wears lingerie, poses in a bed covered with red rose petals, and pops out of a cake. Commentators described the bed scene as an homage to the character Angela Hayes from the 1999 film "American Beauty". Remixes by various artists, including Hector Fonseca, were made to promote the track.
Recording and release.
Paris Hilton co-wrote "I Need You" with its producer Michael Green and songwriter Simon Wilcox. On receiving the instrumental track, Hilton described it as the "first time I had someone send me a song that I immediately was like, I could write to this right away", and said she wrote the lyrics in "a few hours". Heiress released it as a digital download on February 14, 2018. "I Need You" was Hilton's first single in three years, following her 2015 release "High Off My Love", and her first ballad.
A week before the song's release, Hilton posted photos from the music video on her Instagram account as part of a countdown. "Papers Claire Valentine and "Life &amp; Styles Evan Real wrote that Hilton was channeling Marilyn Monroe and Bettie Page for the images, and "Allure"'s Emily Wang considered pin-up models to be the inspirations. When describing the direction of her second album, Hilton said it would be more dance-orientated, and clarified that "I Need You" would be "the only song on there like this".
Even though Hilton promoted it as a "new single" on her social media, the song leaked in 2010; music critics had believed it was a track from her second album, initially expected for release in the fall or winter of that year. Hilton said she re-recorded portions of the vocals and instrumental, and released it as a dedication to her then-fiancée Chris Zylka; she explained: "At that point in my life [when I wrote it], I wasn’t with anyone, so this is the perfect point in my life to release it because now the words definitely mean something." Hilton previewed the song for Zylka while they were driving home from the recording studio; he cried on hearing it.
Composition and lyrics.
"I Need You" is a doo-wop and pop ballad that lasts three minutes and 35-seconds. Michael Green looked to 1950s music as inspiration for the composition. Hilton described "I Need You" as "the ultimate Valentine’s Day song" and "a song that people could listen to ... , smile and make out to". It is a departure from Hilton's previous pop and dance-oriented releases since she wanted to record "something timeless and classic". "Cosmopolitans Eileen Reslen wrote that "I Need You" has a softer sound than Hilton's 2006 singles "Stars Are Blind" and "Nothing in This World". "Times Raisa Bruner described its tone as "a sugary doo-wop vibe". Critics noted that Hilton uses "breathy vocals" throughout the song.
The track opens with Hilton saying: "Babe I love you so much so I wrote you this song. I need you." She sings about love, saying she will "never lose sight of the reasons that I love you", and the safety felt in a relationship: "You make me want to be the woman I've always wanted to be." The chorus is: "Every hour of the day (every hour of the day), every day of the week (every day of the week). I need you (I need you)." The lyrics feature puns about holidays, such as "I wanna be the bunny in your Easter". Other examples include: "I wanna put the happy in your Birthday / And I wanna be the merry in your Christmas / I’m always giving thanks for you on every Thanksgiving." "Out" magazine writer Hilton Dresden described the song as "over-the-top syrupy and smothering". "Paper"'s Michael Love Michael said it was about a "profound neediness" and a desire to spend a day with a significant other.
Reception.
"I Need You" received generally positive reviews from music critics. It was included Vulture.com's list of the best songs for the week of February 14, 2018, and a playlist for 2018 Best Songs of the Week. Critics likened the song to a Valentine's Day gift, including "Bustles Shannon Carlin who described it as a "deliciously over-the-top holiday treat". Idolator's Mike Wass said Hilton replaced Cupid the "true messenger of love" in the song, and "Peoples Nicole Sands praised the lyrics as "written in the name of love". The song's composition was also the subject of praise. Michael Love Michael enjoyed its "featherlight doo-wop arrangement", and the "Gay Times"' Sam Damshenas identified the song as a "bubbly, doo-wop inspired affair". In a less enthusiastic review, "Vogue Australia"'s Francesca Wallace wrote "the song actually isn’t too bad".
Some critics praised Hilton for pursuing a different musical style. Hilton Dresden wrote the single reflected a "softer, moodier direction" for Hilton. Michael Love Michael viewed it as a "refreshing sonic direction" in Hilton's music career. Raisa Bruner cited "I Need You" as a part of Hilton's "ongoing reinvention", and considered it one of the top five songs released in the week of February 16, 2018.
Commercially, "I Need You" debuted at number 48 and peaked at number 32 on the Dance Club Songs "Billboard" chart. It marked Hilton's fifth appearance on the chart, following "Stars Are Blind", "Turn It Up", "Nothing in This World", and "High Off My Love". According to Cait Munro of "Refinery29", the song was not as commercially successful as "Stars Are Blind", which she labeled a "cult hit".
Music video and promotion.
Chris Zylka directed and produced the single's accompanying music video, which was released on February 14, 2018, through Hilton's official YouTube account. Hilton felt "more comfortable" with Zylka as the director. The video was shot in February 2018, and the editing process took roughly a week. A behind the scenes video was uploaded on her YouTube account on May 28, 2018. She explained Marilyn Monroe, specifically her performance of "I Wanna Be Loved by You""," and Jessica Rabbit inspired it. She described it as "a Valentine to [Zylka] and to all of my fans".
Hilton appears in "various stages of undress" throughout the video. She is shown wearing different wigs and 1950s-inspired fashion, including various types of lingerie. She bakes cupcakes while wearing a polka dot apron and pops out of a cake. For another scene, she appears naked on a bed covered in red rose petals, which critics felt was an homage to the character Angela Hayes from the 1999 film "American Beauty". For the shot, Hilton wears nude fish-net leggings and jewelry rather than being fully naked like Hayes was in the movie. Emily Wang wrote that Hilton's various outfits included "other photographic homages to classic Americana imagery", likening some of her looks in the video to those of Jayne Mansfield and Barbie dolls from the 1950s. Shannon Carlin of "Bustle" compared the clip to a David Lynch production.
Remixes by various artists, including Stash Konig, Dirty Disco and Nitemover, were made available to promote the track. They were released primarily on SoundCloud through the individual producers' accounts, while Hector Fonseca and Zambianco posted it on their Facebook account. Hilton commissioned the remixes "so that [she] can play it in Ibiza and during [her] concerts".

St. Mary of the Angels Church, Hollywood

St. Mary of the Angels Church, Hollywood, formally the St. Mary of the Angels Anglo-Catholic Church, Hollywood, California, and referred to locally as "St. Mary's", is an Anglo-Catholic church in Hollywood, California, in the Los Feliz neighborhood.
History.
St. Mary's was founded by Rev. Neal Dodd, an Iowan native who moved to Hollywood, California and became a technical advisor and eventual actor in the early years of Hollywood’s film industry development. His involvement in the early days of Hollywood as priest on and off screen earned him many nicknames, like “The Padre of Hollywood”, “Hollywood’s Padre”, and “One Take Dodd”.
Originally, St. Mary's and her congregation gathered in a small storefront on N. Vermont Avenue in Hollywood, before moving to a space on New Hampshire Avenue where a Lutheran church now stands. The old church building on New Hampshire was razed in preparations for the Lutheran church's construction.
Architecture.
The first church building for St. Mary's was a rented storefront on N Vermont Avenue that still stands today. However, St. Mary's moved not too long after. After having raised $1100USD (February 4, 2018 equivalent: $17,832.09), a small church building was built in a week on New Hampshire Avenue.
The present building was designed in the Spanish Mission-style by noted architect Carleton Winslow. Much of the planning occurred in 1929. Church records of tentative specifications for St. Mary's include specific details for a great deal of wood carpentry, including oak and birch wood with oil staining, varnish, and Lammens "Permo" waterproof brush coats, as well as hand made mission tiles for the roofing. Galvanized iron, steel, copper, concrete, and other materials help complete St. Mary's.
Finials, decorative addictions at the top of the building's façade, were included as well, made of cast stone. At some point, they were no longer a part of the building but were replaced in 2011.
A part of its architecture also includes an addition made in the mid-1900s wherein the altar space was changed slightly to accommodate a 16th-century della Robbia faience from Florence.
The della Robbia faience.
The faience is a terra cotta and porcelain altarpiece of the Annunciation, along with two side statues of St. John and St. Francis as well as two smaller side statues of floral arrangements in large vases. It was donated to St. Mary's according to church history in the 1920s by the founder of The Broadway and Bullocks department stores and was a fixture in the church when it was on New Hampshire Avenue.
When the current church building for St. Mary's was built, it was installed outside as a permanent fixture in one of the walls of the small church courtyard garden before being moved inside during the mid-1900s.
According to church records, the remodel of the sanctuary to accommodate the della Robbia required extensive flexibility. The pews inside the church were removed in order to make room for a track to be temporarily installed from the front doors of the church to the altar. A crane was required to carry each piece of the faience to and down the track, sideways. The entirety of the faience weighs over 15 tons.
Furthermore, the church building's floor was reinforced, especially under the altar sanctuary before any of the installation could occur. The area where the faience currently resides was originally a squared-off ending to the building but was replaced with a curved, steel shell was installed behind the altar at the time of installation. Wrought iron work was installed where the della Robbia had been in the garden.
Music and choirs.
Organ.
The organ at St Mary's was originally built in 1906 for the S.A. Sanderson residence in Long Beach, California. It was sold in 1912 to E.F. Robbins for his home in Pasadena, California. In 1927, William Ripley Dorr purchased the organ for his studio in Los Angeles, California. Some time after, it was sold to St. Mary's and dedicated. Also according to church history, W.C. Fields underwrote part of the organ.
The organ has tubular pneumatic key action and pneumatic stop action. It also has two (2) manuals, 10 stops, and 10 ranks. Its manual compass is 61 notes and its pedal compass is 30. It also has an attached keydesk.
Organists and Choirmasters.
The Organist and Choirmaster has the responsibility of directing the St Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum.
Since 1820 the posts of Organist and Choirmaster have been held by a number of musicians, often being combined.
Choirs.
The choir at St. Mary's is known as the St. Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum. They sing at each Sunday Solemn High Mass as well as specific High Holy Days throughout the year, including Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter Masses.
Much of their repertoire comes from the hymnals found in the pews. They also practice anthems or special Mass Parts responses for the weekly services.
Prior selections include:
•"I Was Glad" by C. Hubert H. Parry
•"Laud We The Name Of God Most Holy" by J.S. Bach
•"Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis" by Orlando Gibbons
•"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place" by Johannes Brahms
•"Kyrie" and "Agnus Dei I" from Palestrina's "Missa Brevis"
Church service schedule.
High or Low Masses.
St. Mary's has a rich tradition with regards to their celebration of the Mass. However, this tradition is shared in different ways. A "High Mass" has more music and song in the form of Gregorian Chant or other kinds of chant throughout the Mass. There are also more people involved with the ceremonial aspect of the Mass helping the priest, usually including a deacon and a subdeacon. Incense is also used during the service. A sermon is almost always shared after the Gospel readings at a High Mass. Usually, the High Mass at St. Mary's is a Solemn High Mass; however, Festal High Masses are celebrated on major feast days, with principal service on Sundays and major holy days.
By contrast, a Low Mass is celebrated by one priest, usually assisted by an acolyte. The words of the liturgy are spoken, not sung, incense is not used, and sermons are rarely included.
The Solemn High Mass for the church is celebrated every Sunday at 10:00 AM PST. 
Low Masses include the Sunday Low Mass at 8:00 AM.

Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin

Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin, located in the very southern region of California, is one of the driest basins in the state. With climate change predicted to have strong effects into foreseeable future, the region is viewed with a skepticism in the sustainable use of water at current rates of consumption. Both natural and man-made geographic divisions within this basin allow for a closer inspection of the various management techniques implemented throughout the years, and provide a basis for what may be pursued for an uncertain future.
Geography of region.
The Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin is housed underneath the Borrego Valley, which lies in both San Diego and Imperial counties of southern California. It reaches from the San Ysidro Mountains in San Diego County, to the east, where it enters Imperial County. As of 2016, the California Department of Water Resources split this basin into two sub-basins, Borrego Springs and Ocotillo Wells. The total surface area of this basin is 150,000 acres (240 square miles), encompassing three aquifers throughout the valley. 
The natural landscape of this area consists mostly of shrublands, rocky outcrops and sediment, with sparse forested areas. The altitudes in this region ranges from 30 feet below sea level in the Lower Borrego Valley, and exceeds 4,500 ft above sea level in the San Ysidro Mountains. The average amount of precipitation gained in the Borrego Valley basin is usually less than 5 inches, and falls throughout the year, due to the climate being mostly the same year-round. It is mostly arid and dry, with a slightly cooler winter. 
The valley contains three aquifers: the upper, middle, and lower. The uppermost aquifer is made of alluvial, fan, playa and eolian deposits from the time between the Holocene and Pleistocene, and is up to 1,000 feet thick at the northern end of the basin. This layer provides the main source of water for the Borrego Valley. Beneath this layer lies the middle and lower aquifers, containing Pleistocene-age continental deposits such as consolidated sand, gravel, and boulders. The middle aquifer is thickest in the center of the valley, measuring 700 feet, while the lower aquifer reaches depths of 1800 feet in the southern portion. 
Borrego Springs Sub-Basin.
This region lies exclusively in San Diego County, with its northernmost edge in the Santa Rosa Mountains, and the San Felipe / Yaqui Ridge anticline and San Felipe fault in the south. At the western boundary, the San Ysidro Mountains provide the demarcation, while the eastern edge is defined by both the Coyote Creek and Superstition Mountain faultlines. Coyote Creek flows into the valley toward Borrego Sink, the prominent collection point for runoff, that sometimes overflows into the San Felipe Wash. Flow between the sub-basins is inhibited due to the immense alluvial sediments in Borrego Springs being cut off from the San Felipe Wash by the presence of large geologic structures. The effect had on each sub-basin is a reduced influence of groundwater pumping; the pumping of water from one area will not easily effect the next area. 
Ocotillo Wells Sub-Basin.
Unlike Borrego Springs, this sub-basin lies in both San Diego and Imperial counties. The westernmost region of Ocotillo Wells lies along Fish Creek and the Coyote Mountains, and a surface drainage divide extending from the Coyote Mountains to the Superstition Mountains provides the eastern boundary. Groundwater in this basin is sourced from the mountains to the northeast, similar to the Borrego Springs sub-basin.
Recreation.
This scenic area provides ample opportunity for hiking, observing nature, golfing, and trips to the nearby Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. There is also an assortment of camping locations, as well as wildflower and wildlife viewing areas.
Uses of groundwater.
While this region consists of desert, seemingly counter-intuitive uses of water persist. These include irrigation, not only of agricultural fields, but also vegetated landscapes like golf resorts. Another main water use, though a bit more practical, is the use of septic systems to dispose of wastewater. From 1945 to 2010, a decline of up to two feet per year in groundwater levels occurred, mainly in the northern area of Borrego Valley, where agriculture predominates.
As of 2010, a total of 50 wells were used for agricultural purposes, while eight service golf courses, and residential users rely on 14. More wells exist or are planned, but only 20 of the existing ones are monitored in their usage.
Groundwater use by the agricultural sector, recreation, municipalities, and even Anza-Borrego Desert State Park cumulatively required four times as much water as what can naturally recharge in the basin. Due to this, the U.S. Geological Survey and Borrego Water District began working together to develop a better understanding of Borrego Valley's hydrogeology, in order to know what hydrologic effects might arise from future land development projects.
Groundwater availability and quality.
Availability.
Groundwater availability is worrisome for the Borrego Valley because water levels have decreased more than 100 feet in some areas of the basin. The Borrego Valley Hydrologic Model was created to recreate historic conditions so that past movement and use of both surface and groundwater could be analyzed, in hopes of addressing what future conditions may hold for the valley. Groundwater becomes available via percolation from various intermittent streams, such as Coyote Creek, which flow from the mountains in the northwest. It is estimated that a total 5,500,000 acre feet of groundwater can be stored in the Borrego Springs sub-basin, but as much time has passed, and over-drafting has occurred, the storage capacity may be more limited. The Ocotillo Wells sub-basin was estimated to be able to hold roughly 6,250,000 acre feet, but a similar situation to Borrego Springs plays into the shrinkage of capacity.
Quality.
Groundwater quality is extremely important to this region, as it is the only source of water available for agriculture, recreation, and general public use. Groundwater quality in this region is mostly affected by the available quantity. This is to be expected, as the concentration of dissolved solids will become greater in groundwater stocks that are decreasing in volume. One issue that is associated with this is that as groundwater levels fluctuate, their ability to flow from underlying aquifers to wells is impacted, and can cause erratic amounts of present toxicants to either increase or decrease in the water. An analysis on historic water quality data from the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin performed by the U.S. Geological Survey concluded that total dissolved solids (TDS) and nitrate in the upper level of the aquifer exceeded the water-quality thresholds for each given substance (500mg/L and 10 mg/L respectively). TDS, sulfates, and nitrates were found to have variable levels throughout the upper aquifer as well as geographic location within the basin. This same study examined the rate of groundwater recharge for the basin, and found that very little is actually occurring, mostly attributed to changing climatic conditions. Instead of water percolating down into this basin, the water has been shifted in its area of deposition, so that recharge is happening adjacent to the bordering mountain ranges. 
Municipality.
The creation of the Borrego Water District in 1962 stemmed from the community wanting to protect the valley's groundwater from being sent to Salton Sea area, where much development was taking place. The Borrego Water District (BWD) is the only body to serve the needs of about 800 customers with nearly 1,600 acre feet per year thru 2,100 metered water connections, provides sewage treatment, flood control, and pest (gnat) management in select zones within the service area.
The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act requires that each basin deemed high or medium priority in the state forms a Groundwater Sustainability Agency, in which the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin falls. The goals for these GSA's are to "avoid “undesirable results” in groundwater elevations, storage levels, water quality degradation, land subsidence, seawater intrusion and downstream interconnected water impacts," all by July 2019. Estimates made in 2015 by the U.S. Geological Survey say that the over draft of the basin is about 13,000 acre feet per year (4.2 billion gallons). This is adds up to be around 70% of the current use of water throughout the entire basin, so the GSA associated with the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin aims to reduce yearly water usage from 19,100 acre feet down to 5,700 is needed for sustainability.

Genoplesium turfosum

Genoplesium turfosum, commonly known as the alpine midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to a small area in the higher parts of New South Wales. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five dark purplish-red, crowded flowers with a sparsely hairy labellum.
Description.
"Genoplesium turfosum" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf with a purplish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between two and twenty five flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are dark purplish-red and about wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg-shaped, about long, wide and reddish-purple with darker bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark bands. The labellum is linear to egg-shaped, long, about wide with a few coarse, blackish hairs up to long on its edges. There is a dark purplish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in November and December.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Genoplesium turfosum" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Corunastylis turfosa" but the change is not accepted by the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet ("turfosum") is a Latin word meaning "peaty" or "boggy", referring to the habitat of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The alpine midge orchid grows with dense sedges in boggy places in the Kosciuszko National Park.

Mydas clavatus

Mydas clavatus is a species of Mydas fly that is native to temperate, eastern North America. It is named for its clubbed antennae, which is however a general feature of the Mydas flies. An orange to red mark on the abdomen is distinctive. It is a Batesian mimic of certain spider wasps, and is consequently quite bold in its movements. Adults fly in mid-summer.
Description.
They are large, black and somewhat glabrate flies that measure some 25 to 30 mm in length, with a wingspan that may exceed 50 mm. A prominent orange to red mark is evident on the ventral side of the second abdominal segment. Their visual mimicry is apparently complemented by curling and jabbing of the abdomen in a mock stinging routine.
Biology.
The eggs are deposited singly in soil or rotting wood. The larvae, as with "M. brunneus" and "M. tibialis", are predatory on the larvae of deadwood-feeding scarab beetles ("Osmoderma" species.) and can be found in standing and downed trees with extensive heart rot. The adults seem to be pollen and nectar feeders only, and have been observed at "Asclepias", "Saponana", "Spiraea", "Monarda", "Pycnanthemum", "Teucrium" and "Verbena" flowers. When not nectaring, adults may be seen resting on plants or actively running around on the ground. Though the mating behaviour is unknown, it is suspected that males may defend the vicinity of larval food sources.
Habitat.
They are present in various habitats, including deciduous woodlands, fields, meadows, gardens, and other.

Louise Celia Fleming

Louise Celia "Lulu" Fleming (January 28, 1862 – June 20, 1899) was a medical doctor and one of the first African-Americans to graduate from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania. She returned from Africa to improve her skills and she was the first African-American woman to be commissioned for work in Africa by the Woman's American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society. 
Biography.
Fleming was born on January 28, 1862 to slave parents on Col. Lewis Michael Fleming's Hibernia Plantation in Hibernia, Clay County, Florida in 1862. She converted to Christianity at age 15 at the Bethel Baptist Institutional Church in Jacksonville. She was encouraged to attend university and graduated from Shaw University in 1885. Fleming obtained a basic education and became a public school teacher in Saint Augustine, Florida.
In 1886 the "Woman’s Baptist Foreign Mission Society of the West" invited Flemming to become their missionary representative to the Congo. She accepted the invitation and arrived in the Congo in 1887, stationed at Palabala. She worked in the Congo with girls, teaching Sunday school, primary classes and English classes. Flemming returned to the United States in 1891 in order to regain her health.
The same year, with the idea of alleviating illness in the Congo, she enrolled in the Women’s Medical College in Philadelphia. She graduated in 1895.
Flemming returned to her mission in the Congo, becoming the only African-American woman doctor in the country. In 1898 Fleming contracted African trypanosomiasis and returned to the United States. Fleming died on June 20, 1899 at the Samaritan Hospital in Philadelphia at the age of 37.

Selase Agbenyefia or Selase Yaaya Agbenyefia (born 1978) is an officer in the Ghana Air Force and she became the first Ghanaian female helicopter pilot.
Life.
Agbenyefia was born in 1978 and 1989 she started at Mawuko Girls Secondary School. Two years later she was at Mawuli Secondary School. She took a BSc in Business Administration at the University of Ghana, graduating in 2009. Agbenyefia also holds a Postgraduate Certificate in Public Administration from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration.
Agbenyefia had gained the unusual ambition of becoming a pilot. She applied to join the air force but when she turned up with the other recruits she found that she had been assigned to the army. She challenged this with Major General Joseph Narh Adinkra and she was told that the air force did not take women. She challenged this and her tenacity was rewarded when she was sent away with other prospective pilots for training.
The prospective candidates were reduced to 20 and then to 15 when they were based at the Ghana Military Academy at Teshie in Accra. Her first flight was in an Aero L-29 Delfín Jet Trainer which she first flew with Air Commodore Philip Ayisa in September 1998. There had been women pilots before in Ghana but the two who did fly retired after the 1966 coup in Ghana, so she was the first for 35 years, it is said that she is the first woman pilot of military helicopters in West Africa for 48 years.
In 2015 she was credited with saving President John Mahama's life when she made an unscheduled landing.

Survival of the Fittest (TV series)

Survival of the Fittest is a British reality TV series that premiered on ITV2 on 11 February 2018. The programme comes from the same production company that is behind "Love Island".
The series pits the girls and boys against each-other as a "Battle of the Sexes". They compete in various mental and physical challenges. The show is presented by Laura Whitmore, and is narrated by Brennan Reece.
The series is filmed in South Africa with contestants living in a luxurious lodge. The series finished on 2 March 2018 with the girls being crowned the winners of "Survival Of The Fittest". Mettisse was voted the fittest girl of the girls team and chose to split her £40,000 cash prize with her team, so each girl received £10,000.
Billed as a sister-show to "Love Island"; the series was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.
Contestants.
On 11 February 2018, 6 boys and 6 girls began competing in a battle of the sexes for a cash prize of £40,000.
The boys and girls compete against each other in a series of team challenges throughout the series. The winning team will automatically be safe from elimination while the losing team will face the public vote. The opposing team will then decide who is to be eliminated among those who are not saved by the public vote. When a contestant is eliminated, a new contestant will join the lodge as replacement.
After Shanice's arrival on Day 16, there will be no more replacements as the public votes for the "fittest boy" and "fittest girl", and only 4 girls and 4 boys will make the final.

Flag of the Duchy of Teschen

The flag of the Duchy of Teschen was established in 2016 through the initiative of regional history enthusiasts in cooperation with the prominent Polish heraldic and vexillologist Alfred Znamierowski. The flag refers to the coat of arms and the historic banners of the Duchy of Teschen. The modern flag is an expression of respect for the history and tradition of the Duchy of Teschen, and also part of the different identities of the present inhabitants of the Cieszyn Silesia towards Lower and Upper Silesia. 
History.
The oldest image of the Duchy of Teschen flag or banner was shown on the personal seal of the first duke, Mieszko I. That seal was attached to the document from 1297. The next premises of the flags, or rather ducal banners, date from the 14th century, and are associated with Duke Przemyslaw I Noszak (read: Noschack) who, from 1355, took an active part in political life, becoming one of the most important figures in the court of the Czech rulers over time, which included Emperor Charles IV and King Wenceslas IV. Unfortunately, banners from this period have not survived to our times.
The banner of the Duchy of Teschen, since 1605, remains the oldest preserved image of the ducal flag. The banner was ordered by Duke Adam Wenceslas, who, in 1605, was appointed commander of the Silesian army. As a of the Habsburgs, he was involved in wars in Hungary and Moravia. The banner was made of blue satin and 160 x 240 cm in size. In the front part, there is a gold-painted eagle of the Duchy of Teschen, and the free part ends with two sharp tongues.
The ducal banners, which bore the image of golden eagles in a crown on a blue background, were used until the death of the last Piast ruler, Elisabeth Lucretia. From 1742, the official flag of the Duchy of Teschen was the Austrian Silesia flag, which included the Duchy of Teschen. 
Colours.
The flag's colouring refers directly to the preserved iconographic messages of the dynastic coat of arms of the Teschen Piasts and the 17th century banner of the Duchy of Teschen. From the end of the 13th century, the shield of the dukes of Teschen was a golden eagle facing left in a blue field. From the 15th century, it was a golden crowned eagle, although the image of the crowned eagle appeared in the 14th century on the castle tiles during the Duke Premysl I Noszak era. Some foreign sources, such as the Stockholm Codex Bergshammar, from 1430 to 1436, show the Teschen eagle with a red beak, tongue, and claws. However, later sources, such as the "Silesian Arms," from 1577 to 1578, depict an eagle with only a red tongue, emerging from the half-open beak, which is in the golden colour of the eagle. This unchangeability of the image and colours is confirmed by Siebmacher's coat of arms, and a later description in the work of Spener. The contemporary flag of the Duchy of Teschen also refers to this colour scheme.
Eagle of the Duchy of Teschen.
In the Duchy of Teschen, from the end of the 15th century, the crowned eagle appeared unceasingly on all ducal seals, coins, and banners, until the death of the Duchess Elizabeth Lucretia in 1653. Thanks to the relations with the court of the last Jagiellon family during the 16th century, the image of the Teschen eagle on the Piast seals was modelled on the eagle from the crown seal of the Kingdom of Poland. The only differences were the form of the crown itself and the colours. On the head of the Polish eagle was the Renaissance-Baroque closed crown, while on the coat of arms of the Duchy of Teschen was the medieval open crown. It is important that the crowned eagle meant priority over the eagle (e.g. Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia), which could not be crowned. In European heraldry, the crowned eagle is a state eagle and means sovereignty. The eagle on the contemporary flag of the Duchy of Teschen (also Duchy of Cieszyn) is a direct representation of the 16th century version

Monolith Tour

The Monolith Tour was a concert tour by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. Staged in support of the band's fifth studio album "America" (2018), the tour visited arenas and stadiums throughout 2018 and 2019. It was initially announced in October 2017 with European dates being released at the same time, with North American dates announced afterwards. It began on March 12, 2018 in Basel, Switzerland, and concluded on August 17, 2019 in Großpösna, Germany. The support acts for the tour included Walk the Moon, K.Flay, MisterWives, Joywave, and Welshly Arms.
The tour was promoted by Live Nation and sponsored in-part by AT&amp;T. Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary.
Background.
Thirty Seconds to Mars officially announced the tour on October 6, 2017, shortly after releasing the song "Walk on Water" as the lead single from their fifth studio album. The band debuted live the song at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, during a performance which was described as groundbreaking since it became the first live broadcasting shown through innovative infrared technology. The announcement came after the band concluded a promotional tour with Muse and PVRIS, which was one of the highest-grossing North American tour of 2017, according to "Pollstar"'s annual year end tour chart. On February 8, 2018, tour dates were revealed for North America in two legs. Frontman Jared Leto made the announcement on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", giving members of the audience a ticket to an upcoming show. In addition, it was announced that the band's fifth studio album "America" will be released on April 6, 2018. Walk the Moon, K.Flay, MisterWives, Joywave, and Welshly Arms were confirmed as the supporting acts on select dates.
Development.
Initially, twenty-nine shows were scheduled in Europe beginning in March 2018. Pre-sale tickets for the tour were offered to the band's fan club members on October 11, 2017, before going on sale to the general public on October 13. Initial dates for the tour sold out, prompting Live Nation to extend the tour with additional dates. In February 2018, thirty shows were announced to take place across the United States and Canada, beginning in June 2018. For the North American dates, Thirty Seconds to Mars partnered with Citigroup and AT&amp;T; the latter partly sponsored the tour, including the Camp Mars Music Festival held in Malibu, California, by the band. Tickets for North American dates went on sale to the general public on February 16 at Live Nation. Copies of the album are included along with the purchased tickets. Special privileges were provided to Citi bank card holders, who had the opportunity to utilize the pre-sale in multiple locations on February 13.
On March 16, 2018, it was announced that the lead guitarist of the band, Tomo Miličević, would be taking a break from touring due to personal matters. In June 2018, he officially announced his departure from the band.

Casa dello scugnizzo

The Casa dello Scugnizzo (House of the Scugnizzo), is a multifunctional foundation of social assistance in the district of Materdei in Naples.
History.
It was founded in 1951 by Father Mario Borrelli in one of the poorest districts of Naples to care for the street children of Naples. During the war, Naples was a major base for American and other allied Navies. At the end of the war, Italy, and Naples in particular, was desperately poor. When the navies sailed to their home waters after the war, many children were left in Naples with no care or social support. Mario Borrelli recognised this issue and set up the Casa dello Scugnizzo to provide a refuge for these children where they could be fed and educated, helping them to achieve fulfilling lives. Borrelli also helped to set up a network of committees throughout Europe and America to provide funding and support.
In 1958, the film "The Kiss of the Sun" (also known as "Il bacio del Sole-Don Vesuvio"), was released in cinemas and was distributed throughout Europe, while British television (ITV Television Playhouse) produced a biographical script in episodes entitled "Children of the Sun".
Social care.
In addition to child care, the foundation now helps women, the elderly and immigrants thanks to collaboration with other bodies.

Makarony po-flotski

Makarony po-flotski (Russian: "макароны по-флотски", literally navy-style pasta) is a Russian dish made of cooked pasta (typically macaroni, penne or fusilli) mixed with stuffing made of stewed ground meat (usually beef or pork), fried onions and seasoned with salt and black pepper. Originally served in maritime forces, the dish became popular in Russia due to its simplicity, low costs and short time of preparation. Makarony po-flotski became especially popular after World War II during times of poverty in the Soviet Union.
Preparation.
The pasta is cooked in salted boiling water. The onions are well chopped, while meat is minced. After pouring some oil on the pan the chopped onions are fried and after they get a golden color the meat is added to them to get fried. The ground meat can be replaced by canned meat ("tushonka"). The stuffing is seasoned with salt and pepper. When the meat is fried and the pasta is cooked they are mixed together. The dish is usually served without any additions, but can be eaten with pickles.

Sachem Head Capital Management

Sachem Head Capital Management is a value-oriented investment management firm based in New York City, managed by Scott Ferguson.
The fund was founded in 2012. According to "Fortune", Ferguson "tends to be less combative than other activists."
Founding.
Ferguson, a protégé of Bill Ackman at Pershing Square Capital Management, founded Sachem Head in 2012. The name derives from Sachem Head, an overlook in the Pocumtuck Range in New England.
Executives.
Ferguson is Managing Partner and Portfolio Manager. Michael David Adamski is General Counsel, and Geoffrey Hamilton and Scott Arnold are analysts.
Ernesto Cruz, formerly of JAT Capital and Highline Capital Management, joined Sachem Head in 2013, becoming a partner and an analyst of technology stocks. In February 2017, he left Sachem Head to become a portfolio manager for GIC Private Ltd., Singapore's sovereign wealth fund.
Investment activities.
As of January 2014, Sachem Head had around $4 billion in assets under management.
Sachem has taken positions in Zoetis Inc., an animal health-care group. A month after CDK Global, an IT provider, went public in early October 2014, Sachem Head became its biggest investor. As of 2016, CDK's stock had risen by more than 80%.
As of February 2017, Sachem Head's largest position was in Autodesk, which manufactures 3-D design software, and which returned 7.7% in 2016.
In January 2018, Sachem Head asked Whitbread, owner of the Premier Inn chain in the United Kingdom, "to consider a break up of its Costa Coffee chain from its hotels and restaurant businesses." Sachem Head believed that such an action would "boost the value of its individual businesses."
Profitability.
A 2016 article in Fortune noted that while other protégés of Bill Ackman were "struggling," Ferguson was "doing well," outperforming not only Ackman but the market. In 2014, Sachem Head's fund returned 20.5%.

William Bilsland

Sir William Bilsland LLD (17 March 1847 – 27 August 1921) was a Scottish baker who owned one of Scotland's largest bakeries, and was Lord Provost of Glasgow. He was an elder of the United Free Church of Scotland and a supporter of the temperance movement.
Life.
He was born on 17 March 1847 at Ballat near Balfron, the son of Ann Blair and James Bilsland, a farmer.
He was educated at Dalmanoch school in Bonhill living there with his uncle, Dr Alexander Leckie.
From 1860 to 1869 he worked as a grocer's assistant in Glasgow. In 1869 he opened a shop at 223 Garscube Road. In 1872 he opened a bakery in Greenhill Street and also acquired an existing bakery in Elderslie Street.
Bilsland Brothers.
In 1877, with his brothers, he bought a large piece of ground on Hydepark Street and on which they built the large Hydepark Bakery, adopting the company name of Bilsland Brothers.
By 1900 they employed 200 people and made 230,000 loaves of bread a week, over 10 million loaves per year. They supplied 1600 retailers. Workers were well-paid, worked a 40 hour maximum week, unusual for the time, and all received free bread.
In 1912 they acquired the rival company of Gray and Dunn (but retained their name as Gray Dunn &amp; Co). The main company was rebranded as Glasgow Bakeries.
The company traded until 1985. The bakery was demolished in 2015.
Politics.
In 1886 he became a town councillor representing the 13th ward in Glasgow.
In 1905 he was elected Lord Provost, succeeding John Ure Primrose. He served until 1908 during which time he saw many artistic projects, in particular the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. During this period he lived at 28 Park Circus a beautiful, three-storey Georgian circus form, just east of Kelvingrove Park.
In 1907 King Edward VII created him a baronet, as Sir William Bilsland, Baronet of Park Circus, for his services to Glasgow.
He died on 27 August 1921.
Family.
In 1885 he married Agnes Anne Steven (d.1935). Together they had two childrenAgnes Anne (1896-1970) and Steven Bilsland, who inherited the business on his death.

David Turnbull (footballer)

David Turnbull (born 10 July 1999) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Celtic and the Scotland national team. He began his career at Motherwell, and has won both of the major Young Player of the Year awards (SFWA and PFA).
Club career.
Motherwell.
Raised in Wishaw, Turnbull joined the Motherwell Youth Academy in 2009. He was selected for the Scotland football team (represented by North Lanarkshire school pupils) at the 2014 International Children's Games alongside fellow Motherwell player Jake Hastie, who had already been a teammate for several years during their development. On 27 April 2016, Turnbull, Hastie and another long-term academy colleague Allan Campbell were in the "Well" team that won the Scottish Youth Cup, beating Heart of Midlothian 5–2.
Turnbull made his senior debut for Motherwell on 10 February 2018, in a 2–0 victory away at Dundee in the Scottish Cup. On 8 May 2018, he made his first start and Scottish Professional Football League debut in a 1–0 victory away to Partick Thistle. Later that month he was an unused substitute in the 2018 Scottish Cup Final which Motherwell lost 2–0 to Celtic.
On 31 October 2018, Turnbull scored his first goal for Motherwell against St Mirren. In January 2019, he was the sole goalscorer in two consecutive league wins in the space of four days, at home to Hibernian and away to Dundee. A few days later he signed a new contract with Motherwell, running until summer 2021. In May 2019, amid more goals and growing media praise for his performances, he was nominated for the season's PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year, along with Jake Hastie; the award was won by Ryan Kent. Turnbull won the SFWA Young Player of the Year award for 2018–19, voted for by Scottish football journalists. He was the first Motherwell player to win that award since James McFadden in 2001–02.
In June 2019, Motherwell agreed a club-record £3.25 million fee with Celtic for Turnbull. The proposed deal collapsed when medical tests found that Turnbull would require preventative surgery on his left knee, and the clubs could not agree revised terms. Turnbull returned to Motherwell, had his knee operation – performed by renowned London surgeon Andy Williams – then underwent a rehabilitation programme across the winter (alongside teammate Charles Dunne who was recovering from a groin injury) and resumed full training in February 2020. His mental and physical recovery was chartered in a behind-the-scenes club documentary which followed him from the day of his collapsed move through operations, rehabilitation and to his eventual return to first-team action. He made his return to the first team as a second half substitute at home to St Mirren on 25 February. On 11 March 2020, Turnbull signed a contract extension with Motherwell to run until 2022. With the 2019–20 season halted days afterwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland, he successfully re-established himself as an important member of the side at the outset of 2020–21.
Celtic.
Turnbull joined Celtic on 27 August 2020, on a four-year deal. The fee of around £3 million was a club record for Motherwell. After three substitute appearances during September, he made his first start for the club on 4 October against St Johnstone.
International career.
Turnbull has played at under-16, under-19 and under-20 level for Scotland. He made his debut for the under-21 team in March 2019. He was added to the full national squad for the first time in May 2021, ahead of the delayed UEFA Euro 2020 tournament. He made his debut on 2 June 2021 in a friendly against Netherlands, as a starter.

Samuel Carter (Tavistock MP)

Samuel Carter (11 November 1814 – 30 December 1903) was a British Radical politician and lawyer.
Early life and career.
Carter was the only son of John Carter and Sarah Green, daughter of John Laimbeer. He began his career in his family tannery business, but in 1844 quit to pursue a legal career, entering Middle Temple as a student in 1844, and being called to the bar in 1847. He practiced on the Western Circuit, where he often acted as defence counsel.
Political career.
He first stood for election Tavistock, seeking election on both a Radical and Chartist platform, as well as seeking the extension of the franchise including to women, in 1847 but was not elected until a by-election in April 1852. He campaigned on the grounds of judicial scrutiny, using his legal background. Yet, within nine weeks of his election, parliament was dissolved before he had even taken his seat.
While he was also returned at the general election in July of the same year, this was declared void on 21 February 1853 as he was "not duly qualified". A House of Commons select committee found that, despite Carter owning a home, a tannery, and shares in the local gas company, as well as a bank balance of £47 12s and 8d, he did not meet the property qualification and was unseated. Instead, Robert Phillimore was elected in his place.
Nevertheless, during this brief period of his career, Carter did cause furore in the Commons, after this time being able to take his seat. On 16 November 1852, he complained of the £80,000 cost for the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, five times more than to bury Lord Nelson.
Five years after his unseating, Parliament removed the property qualification for MPs.
Later life.
Carter, having been unseated, resumed his legal career, becoming a revising barrister - involving checking electoral rolls - before losing that job in 1894 after causing offence to too many people.
He married to Caroline Bennison, daughter of John W Bennison, in 1858, and together they had one child: Reginald Llewellyn Bennison.

National Little Britches Rodeo Association

The National Little Britches Rodeo (NLBRA) is one of the oldest youth based rodeo organizations. It was founded in 1952, and sanctions rodeos in over 33 states. NLBRA allows children ages 5 to 18 to compete in a variety of different rodeo events. It’s championship event is the National Little Britches Finals Rodeo. The NLBRA headquarters is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. The NLBRA was founded in Littleton, Colorado. The Finals were held in Pueblo, Colorado, but moved to the Lazy E in Oklahoma in 2016.
The PRCA partners with the NLBRA to offer rodeo camps and safety clinics for contestants. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of the American Cowboy opened up a National Little Britches Rodeo Association exhibit September 20, 2015. In December 2013, Hope Counts was adopted as the Crisis Fund of the NLBRA.
The NLBRA is featured on a national television western lifestyle show that airs on RFD-TV titled "Little Britches Rodeo". They also have a spin-off travel show titled "Little Britches on the Road".
NLBRA Events.
The NLBRA provides three different age groups. Little Wrangler is a coed age group of children between the ages of 5 and 8. Kids ages 9–13 are junior contestants. Senior contestants are ages 14 through 18. Both the junior and senior divisions are broken down into boys and girls events. There are also coed events for the junior and senior categories.
In addition there are awards based up senior and junior all-around cowgirl and all-around cowboy.
A number of notable Pro Rodeo cowboys got their start in Little Britches rodeo.

NLBRA also features a rodeo queen contest every year at their National Finals. They have three categories: National Queen, National Princess, and National Little Wrangler Princess. The categories are by age group. The National Queen is for contestants 14–18 years old. The National Princess is for contestants 9–13 years old. The National Little Wrangler Princess is for girls ages 5–8.
To be eligible, contestants must accumulate enough points, in rodeo competition, to qualify for the National Finals. The rodeo queen contest involves horsemanship, speaking, and a written test. Several contestants have gone on to win state title for Miss Rodeo America.

Ludger Wößmann

Ludger Wößmann (; born in Sendenhorst on July 1, 1973) is a German economist and professor of economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). Moreover, being one of the world's foremost education economists, he is the director of the ifo Center for the Economics of Education at the ifo Institute. Beyond the economics of education, his research interests also include economic growth and economic history. In 2014, Wößmann's empirical research on the effects of education and his corresponding contribution to public debate were awarded the Gossen Prize (the German equivalent of the John Bates Clark Medal), followed by the Gustav Stolper Prize in 2017.
Biography.
A native of Sendenhorst (North Rhine-Westphalia), Ludger Wößmann earned a MA from the University of Marburg in 1998, a PhD (Dr. sc. pol.) from Kiel University in 2001 under Horst Siebert, and obtained his habilitation from the Technical University of Munich in 2006 under Robert K. von Weizsäcker and Hans-Werner Sinn, with all degrees being in economics. Additionally, he also studied at the University of Kent at Canterbury (1995–96) and at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) (1998–99), where he worked as a researcher before and after his PhD (1999–2003). In 2003, Wößmann became Senior Researcher at the ifo Institute, where he took over the leadership of the ifo Center for the Economics of Education one year later. Following his habilitation in 2006, he has worked as a professor of economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In parallel to his academic career in Germany, Wößmann has also held visiting appointments at the Hoover Institution (2007, 2014–15), at Harvard University (2007) and at Aarhus Business School in Denmark (2006).
Wößmann maintains affiliations with several economic research institutions around the world, including the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, CESifo, Warwick's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE), and Harvard University's Program on Education Policy and Governance (PEPG). Moreover, he is a fellow of the International Academy of Education, sits on the editorial boards of the "Economics of Education Review" and "Education Economics", is a member of the Executive Committee of the German Economic Association and chairs its Research Committee on the Economics of Education. Finally, he is also a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) as well as of the German Academy of Science and Engineering and the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.
Academic research.
Wößmann's research has focused on educational achievement and long-term economic growth and development. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Wößmann belongs to the 1% of most cited economists, with a leading position in rankings of education economists. Together with Eric A. Hanushek and Stephen Machin, Wößmann has been a co-editor of the "Handbook of the Economics of Education", the main academic reference in the field of economics of education, since 2011.
Student achievement.
One major strand of Wößmann's research studies the determinants of student achievement, including the role of class size and teacher quality, of educational institutions and education systems, and of tracking and early childhood education. Key themes that emerge from this research focus on the often small effect of quantitative educational inputs such as class size, on students' cognitive skills in developed countries and the substantial effects of educational institutions and systems as well as of the quality of teaching. In this context, Wößmann's analyses of students' performance using TIMSS and PISA data find central exams and control mechanisms, school autonomy in personnel and process decisions, individual teachers' influence over teaching methods, limits to teacher unions' influence on curriculum scope, scrutiny of students' achievements and competition from private schools to be related with higher student performance, findings for which Wößmann and John Bishop provide theoretical foundations. As a consequence, Wößmann has argued in favour of policies promoting school accountability, school autonomy, and school choice, the latter including school choice through public funding for private schools as means to improve learning outcomes. However, while Wößmann emphasizes that school autonomy has positively affected student achievement in developed countries or countries with high-performing education systems, he also cautions that school autonomy may have the opposite effect in countries with low-performing education systems, including many developing countries. In other words, he emphasizes that educational reforms need to be applied with nuance.
Moving beyond the efficiency of education, Wößmann (with Gabriela Schütz and Heinrich Ursprung) has also investigated the inequality of educational opportunity in developed and emerging countries and finds the organisational setup of the education system to have a substantial effect. In particular, he finds private financing of education (but not publicly funded private schools), early tracking and very short as well as very long preschool education to exacerbate educational inequality. Relatedly, Wößmann finds family background to strongly and similarly affect student performance in both European countries and the United States, with the influence of family background being strongest in Germany and Britain and lowest in France and Flemish Belgium. In sum, however, Wößmann argues that education and training systems can advance efficiency and equity at the same time by exploiting complementarities between high returns to (public) educational investment concentrating during early childhood for poor families and high returns during later stages for wealthier families through a policy mix which effectively includes public early childhood education and lifelong training in addition to conventional vocational and higher education.
Economic growth and development.
The other major strand of Wößmann's research addresses the determinants of long-run economic development and short-run economic growth, including education, religion, culture, innovation, and economic structure. Addressing Lant Pritchett's puzzle of a missing link between growth rates in schooling and in economic output, Wößmann and Eric Hanushek find that cognitive skills, rather than mere schooling, are most strongly related to individual earnings, income inequality and economic growth, with important roles for both minimal and high-level skills as well as for complementarities between skills and economic institutions. Consequently, they conclude that measures of school enrollment and attainment tend to underestimate the very large gap between the skill levels of developing and developed countries' populations and that global economic convergence requires a closing of that gap, including through the restructuring of developing countries' educational institutions. Relatedly, Wößmann and Hanushek find that using educational attainment instead of school attainment as a measure of human capital enabled lower growth in Latin American countries' human capital in the second half of the 20th century to largely solve the "Latin American growth puzzle" by explaining up to two-thirds of income differences between that region and the rest of the world. The initial conclusion of Wößmann and Hanushek's research of a strong positive relationship between countries' growth in cognitive skills and economic output has been robust to more sophisticated measures of cross-country educational achievement.
More recently, Wößmann's research has also investigated the international returns to skills as well as the labour market outcomes of different types of education. Criticizing again the use of school attainment as a measure of human capital as well as previous studies' focus on early career earnings, Wößmann and Hanushek (with Guido Schwerdt and Simon Wiederhold) find the lifetime returns to skills based on PIAAC data on adult skills to be about a quarter higher than earlier estimates. Differences between countries' returns to skills estimates are considerable: 14 out of 23 countries display returns to skills in excess of 12% per standard deviation increase, with six countries sporting returns to skills in excess of 21%, the largest returns being offered in the United States at 28%; generally, higher union density, stricter employment protection and larger public sectors are associated with lower returns to skills. Comparing the employment outcomes of general and vocational education, Wößmann, Hanushek and Lei Zhang identify a tradeoff between the gains in youth employment afforded by vocational education and the increased adaptability and higher prime-age employment associated with general education, especially in the context of technological change.
In another part of his research on economic growth, Wößmann has studied the roles of innovation, trade, structural change, and the internet. Analysing the impact of structural change in a dual economy on growth, Wößmann and Jonathan Temple argue that changes in the structure of employment will increase productivity more the higher the inequality between both sectors' marginal products of labour, suggesting that differences in labour reallocation may account for a substantial part of cross-country differences in economic growth. Drawing on theories of the relationship between trade and growth, Wößmann investigates whether innovation in Germany causes exports and suggests that innovation aimed at addressing specific challenges faced by manufacturing on average increases the export share of these firms by about 7%. Last, in their estimation of the effect of broadband infrastructure, a prerequisite for high-speed internet, Wößmann, Nina Czernich, Oliver Falck and Tobias Kretschmer find that a 10% increase in broadband penetration among OECD countries is associated with an increase in annual per capita growth of 0.9–1.5pp. 
Regarding long-term economic development, Wößmann has been investigating the roles of education, religion and culture in work with fellow economist Sascha Becker. Challenging Max Weber's theory of Protestants' work ethic as the main cause for their higher prosperity, they instead argue that Protestant economies prospered because Protestant society emphasized laypeople's Bible lecture, which in turn increased human capital and, by extension, economic prosperity, and find Prussian Protestants' higher literacy in the 19th century to account for most of the difference in economic prosperity to Catholics. In another use of historical Prussian census data, Wößmann, Becker and Francesco Cinnirella present evidence for the existence of a trade-off between child quantity and child education prior to the beginning of Germany's demographic transition, with an endogenous relationship between fertility and education. Finally, in a study of the long-term impact of the Habsburg Empire's civil service on public attitudes, Wößmann, Becker, Katrin Boeckh and Christa Hainz find a positive "Habsburg effect" on current trust and bureaucratic integrity for individuals living in border communities that were narrowly within the Habsburg Empire relative to those that were narrowly without.

Wilcannia Athenaeum

The Wilcannia Athenaeum is a heritage listed, rusticated sandstone building in the town of Wilcannia, New South Wales. Built in 1883 and located at 37 Reid St, the Athenaeum was established to be an institution for community education, a school of arts and included a public library. It has served a number of functions including as a social centre, a library, a newspaper office, a municipal council meeting place, the Wilcannia Telecentre and is now a museum.
Building.
A sandstone single-storey building in Victorian Free Classical style with a parapet and central semi-circular entablature with urns, the style of the building reflects the aspirations of the residents of Wilcannia in an era when it was an administrative centre and the third largest inland river port in Australia.
The building is heritage listed.
History.
The original committee for the Athenaeum included Edward Bulwer Lytton ("Plorn") Dickens, the youngest son of Charles Dickens and Frederic Trollope, son of Anthony Trollope, who was responsible for ordering books for the town library. Walterus Brown, the editor of the short lived "Wilcannia Times" newspaper, published from 1874-1888, was a great supporter of the Athenaeum.
In more recent times, the Athenaeum was the location for the Wilcannia Telecentre and currently operates as the Wilcannia Athenaeum Pioneer Museum.

Donald McWhinnie

 Donald McWhinnie (16 October 1920 – 8 October 1987) was a BBC executive and later a radio, television, and stage director.
Educated at Rotherham Grammar School, McWhinnie worked for the BBC in administrative roles in the 1940s and 1950s and was drama Script Editor from 1951 to 1953. In the later 1950s, he became a radio director, and from the 1960s to the 1980s he was a director of television drama.
McWhinnie, Frederick Bradnum, and Desmond Briscoe together established the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 1959, McWhinnie directed a production of "Embers", a radio play by Samuel Beckett. First broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, the play won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year. McWhinnie wrote about his approach to radio drama in "The art of radio".
In 1962, McWhinnie was nominated for a Tony Award for his screen version of Harold Pinter's "The Caretaker".
In 1965, he directed the first Broadway theatre production of the Bill Naughton comedy "All in Good Time", which opened at the Royale Theatre, New York, on 18 February 1965 and closed on 27 March 1965. It starred Donald Wolfit, Marjorie Rhodes, and Richard Dysart.
The inaugural episode of the BBC Television Shakespeare in December 1978 was announced to be "Much Ado About Nothing", directed by McWhinnie and starring Penelope Keith and Michael York. The episode was shot at a cost of £250,000, edited, and announced as the first of the series, but then was suddenly pulled from the schedule and replaced with "Romeo and Juliet". No reasons were given by the BBC, although newspaper reports suggested the episode had been postponed for re-shoots, due to worries that an actor's "very heavy accent" would be a problem for US audiences. However, there were no reshoots, the episode was abandoned and was later replaced by a new adaptation. It appears that the BBC management regarded the production as a failure.
In 1981, McWhinnie was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director for "Translations".

Mount Morgan State High School

Mount Morgan State High School is a heritage-listed state high school and technical college at 4 Central Street, Mount Morgan, Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1908. It was formerly known as Mount Morgan Technical College. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015.
History.
Mount Morgan State High School was established in the central Queensland mining town of Mount Morgan in 1912, as one of Queensland's first secondary schools. It commenced operating on the Mount Morgan Technical College site, which the two institutions shared until 1964. The former Technical College Building (1908) and Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918), both masonry buildings, are important in demonstrating the growth of technical colleges in Queensland and the establishment of state high schools. These purpose-designed buildings are excellent examples of technical college and Department of Public Works buildings. The Technical College Building has aesthetic significance for its composition and materials, and as a landmark in the town. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity.
European settlement commenced at Ironstone Mountain (Mount Morgan's initial name) when mining of gold began there in 1882. In 1888 Mount Morgan's population was 4000 people scattered in a series of settlements located close to the Dee River and the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company mine. In time, the town centre developed around Morgan and East Streets. Mount Morgan became a municipality (the Borough of Mount Morgan) in 1890 and in the two decades after its creation most of the town's infrastructure was established. From 1898 the town was linked by the Mount Morgan railway line to Rockhampton over the steep Razor Back Range, reducing the town's isolation. According to the 1901 census the population of the area was 8486, with 6280 living within the Mount Morgan municipality. By 1903 the town had a wide variety of facilities and amenities.
After achieving a record annual gold output in 1889 (the highest in the colony), the Mount Morgan mine was the second largest gold producer in Queensland between 1890 and 1909. During the last five years of the 19th century the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, which operated the mine, trebled its annual output of ore, employing an army of new men who increased the town's population to 10,000. The highest production of gold was achieved during the period from 1887 to 1897, after which production fell. From 1906-7 the production focus of the mine changed from gold to copper, but falling copper prices impacted adversely on this.
Technical education classes started in Mount Morgan in 1900 to meet the growing need for skilled labour for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. Classes were initially held in the Mount Morgan School of Arts building in Morgan Street, starting with an enrolment of eight. The Technical College was overseen by a committee, which commenced fundraising for a building in 1905.
Technical education in Queensland grew and evolved after the first technical college was established in Brisbane in 1882. Technical education developed out of the Mechanics Institute and School of Arts movements which arose in Great Britain in the early 19th century, initially "to instruct artisans in the scientific principles of arts and manufactures". In 1902, the 17 technical colleges in Queensland established a Board of Technical Education to advise the Minister for Public Instruction. In 1905, this Board was abolished and a separate branch of the Department of Public Instruction created to oversee technical education. The total number of technical education students enrolled in Queensland in 1905 was 4171 and the state subsidy for technical education was more than .
In 1906, the Mount Morgan Technical College Committee realised that a new building for the expanding college would be costly, so the institution should be responsible to the Queensland Government rather than the School of Arts. The Committee drew up a constitution that was adopted by the School of Arts Committee on 31 May 1906 and subsequently by the government. The college's new board had 12 members - three appointed by the government; four appointed by Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company; two elected by subscribers of 5s and over; two elected by students of certain standing; and one appointed by subscribers of or more.
Queensland's private schools, technical colleges and schools of arts were not built to a standard plan, but were individually designed with variation in style, size and form. Plans for the Technical College Building (now known as Block A) were prepared in the office of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. The design was approved by the college's board and the Department of Public Works, and the contract for erection of the building was awarded to J K Evans of Rockhampton in November 1907, with Arthur Jenks appointed Clerk of Works. By 1908 enrolments in the Mount Morgan technical education classes had increased to 323 and classes were conducted in various building around the town, attesting to the need for a site dedicated to the technical college.
The Mount Morgan Technical College Building, located on the corner of Central and Dee Streets, was completed at the end of 1908. Wherever possible, the building was constructed from materials obtained in Queensland. The bricks were supplied by the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company and made at the company's brickworks (known locally as Gunthorpe's brickworks after its long-term manager, Robert Gunthorpe), situated behind the Mount Morgan railway station. The stone came from G Sanderson's quarry at Stanwell, while all the timber used in the building was Australian. The furniture was specially designed and manufactured in Rockhampton by W A Lawson.
After the building's completion, The Capricornian newspaper praised the new building and the community:"The people of Mount Morgan are to be warmly congratulated on the splendid Technical College which has now been completed and will be opened in the course of the next few weeks. With the exception of the College in Brisbane and the School of Mines in Charters Towers it is by far the finest college in the state, and as a building it certainly surpasses the Charters Towers institution. The cost is over £6000 and the college will be opened free from debt, a remarkable achievement. The Government ... assisted ... by a contribution of well over £4000, and the Mount Morgan Company directly and indirectly subscribed £800, besides presenting the land... The people of Mount Morgan ... provide[d] ... [s]omething like £800 in hard cash..."Money collected from the community to build the Technical College Building was raised from functions, "brick-selling" donations, donations from individuals and businesses, plus from Walter Russell Hall, Director of the mine. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company donated land for the site of the Technical College (worth ); the Secretary's house; another house for the Principal; as well as the Manual Training Building.
Queensland's prosperity from mining and agricultural pursuits in the first decades of the 20th century enabled the government to implement a campaign of construction of large public buildings. This was the case for the Mount Morgan Technical College which received from the Queensland Government for every raised by community.
The technical college was officially opened by the Hon William Kidston, Premier of Queensland, on 24 April 1909. The Capricornian printed the following description of the building at its opening:"The outside of the building... shows only pure materials - brick and stone and timber. No stucco has been allowed in any shape or form, the only plaster being on the inside of the walls of the rooms to ensure ... smooth surfaces for the purposes of light and cleanliness. The question of lighting the rooms both day and night has had especial study and we consider the desired result has been achieved. The main building contains seven classrooms - four on the ground floor and three on the first floor - and in addition, a board-room and library combined, a main entrance hall or vestibule and a museum, besides passages and verandah balcony. The rooms have all been designed to suit present and future conditions and include a demonstration theatre, where demonstrations in physics, chemistry and cookery are held. In additional to the main building, practical classes are held in plumbing in what is called the malthoid building and in practical mechanical engineering and carpentry in the workshops of the Mount Morgan Goldmining Company. The total amount spent on the building is £4301 and on equipment £1699, making a total of £6000."
A plan marking the early layout of the Technical College Building shows it as an L-shaped, two storey structure, with the primary entrance facing east and a secondary entrance to the south. An L-shaped verandah, sheltered by a skillion roof, wrapped around the rear (northwest) of the building at ground level, and a roof lantern provided natural light to the southern classrooms on the first floor. The eastern and southern elevations were each approximately symmetrical and were divided into bays by tall pilasters. The parapets of the central bays were taller than those of the other bays; and the parapet in the centre of the eastern elevation featured the words "TECHNICAL COLLEGE". At the time the Technical College Building opened, Mount Morgan's population was approaching its peak of 13,000 reached in 1910.
Dramatic reform of the Queensland education system began around 1909 and continued until the beginning of World War I. During this period a high school system was introduced, technical education was expanded, the University of Queensland was inaugurated, a teachers' training college was established, the requirement for a local contribution towards construction costs for new schools was abolished, and the school leaving age was increased from 12 to 14 years. Although technically compulsory since 1875, school attendance was not enforced until 1900. Subsequently, student numbers rose across Queensland during the first 15 years of the 20th century.
In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering it to be of little relevance to Queensland's economy which was based on primary industries. The Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided scholarships for high-achieving students to attend elite grammar schools, although few were awarded. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after World War II.
The first high schools were established within existing technical colleges, utilising their buildings. This was the case in Mount Morgan when, on 12 February 1912, Mount Morgan State High School opened in the Technical College Building as one of the six first state high schools in Queensland. Opened by Norman F White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Engineer for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited, the high school initially enrolled 87 pupils. The Technical College continued to operate in the building.
To accommodate the transition from a technical college to a shared facility, the interior of the Technical College Building at Mount Morgan was altered. A 1912 plan, signed off by Thomas Pye, the Deputy Government Architect at the time, shows these changes. Ground floor alterations included: a new partition of glazed shutters and centre-pivoting fanlights added to a southern classroom; a new screen added to the northeastern classroom to accommodate a classroom and "Typewriting and Shorthand Classroom"; and the "Hat and Cloak Room" was converted into a corridor. On the first floor a gangway was constructed over the staircase; the museum adjacent to the stair landing was partitioned off and converted into a library; and the southern, main lecture hall was divided by partly-glazed partitions to create a classroom, dressmaking room and machine drawing classroom. The plan also shows a timber-framed domestic science scullery and ladies cloak room added to the northern end of the rear verandah, and an L-shaped balcony added to the first floor.
From their introduction, the design of high school buildings was the responsibility of the Department of Public Works. The first purpose-built high school buildings were constructed in 1917 and were large, elaborate buildings that were variations of a standard design introduced in 1914, as well as vocational buildings built to standard designs.
The Government Technical Schools Act had been passed in 1908, allowing for the establishment of vocational education-based studies in Queensland schools. Mount Morgan State High School reflects this integration of technical education into the state school system. A Workshops Building (later Science Block and Workshop and now known as Block B), constructed in 1913, had this purpose. The Workshops Building, a single-storey, masonry structure with a Dutch-gable roof, was constructed in the northwestern corner of the site and was primarily accessed from the east. Its interior was divided into two spaces - a blacksmith's shop to the north and a machine shop to the south - which were connected by a set of dual doors. Each space had a western teachers room that flanked the central dividing wall, and a chimney protruded from the northern end of the building.
By 1913, the school site included the Technical College Building, the Workshops Building, a residence, a large shed and a reservoir.
In February 1918 the Department of Public Works decided to add another story to the Science Block and Workshop. The estimated cost was and the work was performed by day labour. The ground floor was converted from a machine shop and blacksmiths' shop to a drawing room and classrooms. The first floor addition provided a lecture room, a classroom, a physics laboratory, a chemical laboratory and offices. It was accessed via a set of exterior stairs, in the centre of the eastern elevation, and the original Dutch-gable roof was refixed atop the addition.
In 1923 plans were drawn for extension of the domestic science scullery to its west to include a laundry. The locations of some lightweight interior partitions within the Technical College Building were also altered. Also at this time, the library was moved to the southern end of the first floor; and its former location was converted into a principal's room. In conjunction with this work, completion of 'improvements to the frontages of the college' consisting of "brick and iron fence, steps, gates, etc", designed by a Mr Johns, and a reinforced concrete retaining wall, running north along the Central Street (Burnett Highway) boundary, were constructed in 1924. The brick fence runs along the site boundary, in the southeastern corner of the site. It frames the Technical College Building and flanks a set of tapered stairs that lead to the building's eastern entrance.
The late 1920s brought unemployment to Mount Morgan. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company went into voluntary liquidation in 1927 and its machinery was sold. However, former mine manager, Adam Alexander Boyd, raised sufficient funds to register a company, Mount Morgan Limited, in June 1929, to exploit the Mount Morgan ore reserves. Initially income was derived from recovering copper from water in the mine, but falling copper prices and a lack of finance, combined with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, meant that liquidation again looked certain.
In the same period, educational changes occurred. In December 1928, the Mount Morgan Technical College was brought under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, and in 1929 Mount Morgan Intermediate School opened on the site of the high school and technical college.
Mount Morgan Mine began open-cut gold mining in 1932. In that year the Queensland Government decided to subsidise the gold mining industry as part of a scheme to increase employment. This government initiative came at a crucial time for the future of Mount Morgan Limited. So successful was the mine that, within eight months, the initial loan of was repaid and further government assistance was not required.
The re-opening meant there was demand for skilled labour again, so classes resumed at the Technical College and the institution became known as the Mount Morgan High and Intermediate School and Technical College. In 1937, Mount Morgan High School celebrated its Silver Jubilee.
The Mount Morgan campus continued to add vocational buildings. By the 1950s the site had acquired: an assay laboratory at the northeastern end of the site; and a carpenters and trade shop located between the Science Block and Workshop and the residence. A 1954 plan shows the location of various concrete retaining walls - one along the northern end of the eastern boundary and another through the centre of the site, between the Technical College Building and the Science Block and Workshop.
The 1960s brought more change to educational opportunities in Mount Morgan. The Intermediate School closed in 1963 and the Technical College closed in the following year. 1968 marked the end of the Mount Morgan High School Past Pupils Association, established in 1924, which had played an important social role in the community and raised funds for improvements to the high school.
Celebration of Mount Morgan State High School's Diamond Jubilee took place on 15 April 1972 coinciding with the official opening of a new classroom block built by the Education Department. Changes at the Mount Morgan mine, affecting employment, took place from the 1970s. In February 1976, staff numbers at the mine were reduced to below 500. In 1981 open cut mining ended when the ore body was exhausted. Smelting ceased in 1984 but extraction of gold from 28 million tonnes (Mt) of tailings took place from 1982 until November 1990.
During the mine's 108-year life approximately of gold, of silver and of copper were mined at Mount Morgan from underground and open cut operations.
Changes on the school site by 1997 included: the demolition of the residence and large shed, and the construction of a sports storage shed and games area in their place; the construction of various teaching buildings - one over a section of the central concrete retaining wall, and three others at the northwestern end of the site; and a toilet block added to the northeastern corner of the site.
The school grounds have also increased in size. Between 1972 and 1980 land to the west of the Science Block and Workshop was added. A large lot north of Bedsor Street was incorporated in the school site by 1954 and in 2015 it is primarily used for sporting facilities. Part of Bedsor Street was closed in 1985 and the school site was reconfigured into one lot in 2011. The Mount Morgan State High School's centenary was commemorated in 2012, recognising its importance to the town.
In 2015, the former Technical College Building (Block A) is used for administration and teaching purposes, and the former Science Block and Workshop (Block B) is used as a library and resource centre. The Mount Morgan State High School is important to Mount Morgan, having been a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. Since establishment it has been a key social focus for the Mount Morgan community with the grounds and buildings serving as the venue for social events.
Description.
Mount Morgan State High School occupies the southern end of a corner block within the town of Mount Morgan; approximately southwest of Rockhampton. Facing east, the site is approximately , and slopes gently down towards the eastern boundary of Central Street (Burnett Highway), the main thoroughfare through Mount Morgan. The site is also bounded by Bedsor Street to the north, Carlton Lane to the west, and Dee Street to the south. It contains a complex of buildings, with the earliest structure, the former Technical College Building (Block A) (1908), in the southeastern corner of the site; and the former Science Block and Workshop (Block B) (1913, extended 1918) approximately in the centre of the site. The former Technical College Building, which prominently fronts the Burnett Highway and Dee Street intersection, is a landmark in its setting and makes an important visual contribution to the streetscape. Other significant elements on-site include: a facebrick fence along the eastern and southern site boundaries; tapered entry steps to the former Technical College Building; a rendered masonry retaining wall along the eastern boundary; a concrete retaining wall in the centre of the site; and a mature fig tree.
1908 Former Technical College Building (Block A).
The former Technical College Building is a two-storey, masonry structure, with a corrugated metal-clad hipped roof and roof lantern concealed from the street by tall facebrick parapets. It is L-shaped in plan and has a strong street presence derived from its simple and regular massing, grand proportions, and symmetrical composition. An L-shaped ground-floor verandah and first-floor balcony wrap around the rear (northwest) side of the building, providing circulation and access to the interior spaces. A timber-framed, weatherboard-clad former scullery flanks the northwestern end of the verandah and stands on low brick stumps.
The building is elegantly composed of red facebrick walls and pilasters, and sandstone dressings. Its red brickwork is English bond with a light mortar. The street-facing elevations are divided into symmetrical bays by tall facebrick pilasters. The parapets of the central bays on both street-facing elevations are tallest; with the parapet in the centre of the eastern, Burnett Highway elevation featuring the words "TECHNICAL COLLEGE" in render. The building's primary entrance is aligned with this parapet and comprises timber panelled doors with a two-light arched fanlight. It has decorative sandstone surrounds and a keystone inscribed with the date "1908". A secondary entrance is located in the southern, Dee Street elevation. Further access is gained via the rear verandah and balcony.
Most original windows have been replaced with modern aluminium frames. Windows on the eastern and southern elevations are generally casements with two-light fanlights, positioned between brick pilasters; however the central bay windows have arched fanlights, with arched sandstone lintel cappings. Timber-framed, double-hung sashed windows survive in the rear verandah and balcony.
The rear verandah has square timber posts, timber floor boards, a timber battened valance and a decorative timber balustrade of crossed members. The floor-framing of the balcony above forms its ceiling. The balcony has square timber posts with decorative brackets and capitals, timber floor boards, and a raked ceiling with exposed timber structural framing. Most of the balcony's balustrade has been replaced with modern bag-racks, and the timber and metal stairs on the northern and northwestern elevations are recent additions.
Internally, the ground floor layout comprises a central foyer with long, narrow classrooms (formerly cookery and typewriting spaces) to the north, administration spaces and classrooms (formerly secretary and board room, and classroom) to the south, and a large classroom (formerly two classrooms) to the southwest. This southwestern classroom retains an early, glazed bulkhead partition in the centre of the space, supported by a cast iron column.
The first floor is reached by a central cedar staircase with a decorative balustrade. This is flanked on the first floor to the east by office space (formerly library), to the north by long and narrow classrooms, and to the south and southwest by classrooms (formerly machine drawing classroom, dressmaking room and classroom). The south and southwestern classrooms retain early partitions that are half-glazed and lined with tongue-and-groove (T&amp;G) timber.
Most interior spaces have plastered walls with v-jointed (VJ) timber board ceilings with early fretwork ceiling vents. The first floor lecture room retains its coved ceiling, and the roof lantern is visible in the space. A pressed metal ceiling is featured in the foyer space. Skirtings, cornices and architraves are generally early and of timber. Most skirtings are wide and have a detailed profile. Many early, four-panel doors survive, some of which retain early fanlights. Modern lightweight partitions and recent carpet floor-linings are not of cultural heritage significance.
1913 Former Science Block and Workshop (Block B).
The former Science Block and Workshop is a two-storey, masonry structure, with a corrugated metal-clad, Dutch-gable roof. The roof gablets are louvred and a row of masonry chimneys survive on the western (rear) and northern sides. The building has a facebrick lower storey and a facebrick and rendered upper storey - the colour of the facebrick changes between the two storeys, indicating the 1918 first floor addition. A modern steel ramp has been added at the rear. The front (eastern) stair has been replaced in steel and is sheltered by a wide, modern awning.
The majority of modern doors and windows are modern, although most remain within early openings. Several early, multi-light fanlights survive. All window hoods and modern awnings are not of cultural heritage significance.
The interior of both the ground and first floors are primarily divided into two large spaces by a central, brick wall (now painted). Most walls are painted brick or are lined in flat sheeting. The ceilings of the ground floor level are plaster and those on the first floor are T&amp;G timber boards. Square lattice ceiling vents survive on the first floor. Skirtings are generally simple timber of a simple profile, and cornices are rounded plaster. Lightweight modern partitions and modern carpet floor-linings are not of cultural heritage significance.
Grounds and landscape features.
The school grounds are well established with a variety of mature trees. A large, mature fig tree (Ficus sp.) is located north of the former Science Block and Workshop.
A red facebrick fence (-54) surrounds the former Technical College Building on the south and east sides. It consists of pillars, linked by walls and metal bars - both the pillars and walls have concrete caps. The fence frames the main entrance of the school; running adjacent to a tapered stair that leads to the eastern entrance of the former Technical College Building. Early cast iron lamps are located on two pilasters either side of the stair.
A rendered masonry retaining wall (1924) adjoins the northern end of the brick fence, and runs along the eastern boundary. Stone and concrete retaining walls (pre-1954), with a central stair, also survive east of the former Science Block and Workshop.
Through its prominent corner location, large scale and limited material pallet, the former Technical College Building has landmark attributes and makes an important contribution to the Burnett Highway streetscape.
Expansive views to both the Mount Morgan Mine Site and the surrounding townscape are obtained from within the school grounds and from the school buildings.
Heritage listing.
Mount Morgan State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Mount Morgan State High School is important in demonstrating the evolution of state and technical education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains: an excellent example of a purpose-designed Technical College Building (1908), which was erected to facilitate the training of a skilled workforce for Mount Morgan's mine; and a Department of Public Works-designed Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918), which was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies.
Constructed during the first two decades of the 20th century, Mount Morgan State High School is also important in demonstrating the significance of mining in colonial and early 20th century Queensland. Mount Morgan was a major mining area, which is reflected in the quality and size of the Technical College Building and the Science Block and Workshop.
Mount Morgan State High School, as one of the first six state high schools in Queensland, is important in demonstrating the pattern of development of secondary education in Queensland. The school also demonstrates the way secondary and technical education were interlinked in the early 20th century, with secondary classes often established at technical colleges.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Mount Morgan State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland technical college complex from the early 20th century, with later modifications. Technical college complexes were custom-designed, and typically featured separate buildings for specialist departments. Significant buildings at Mount Morgan State High School are a substantial Technical College Building (1908) and a former Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918). The buildings are set within a landscaped site that includes mature shade trees and retaining walls.
The Technical College Building, designed in the office of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, is an excellent, intact example of a Queensland technical college building from the early 1900s. It is a large, masonry structure with contrasting decorative capping and lintels; built in a confident and stripped classical style; with grand and imposing street-facing elevations; and sited in a prominent location within the grounds. The interior layout is functional, with a variety of classroom configurations designed for specialist classes.
The former Science Block and Workshop is a good example of a vocational workshop building constructed for a specialist technical college department. Located away from the main Technical College Building to minimise noise disruption, the building is of masonry construction, has plainer finishes than the Technical College Building, and features chimneys that were associated with workshop furnaces.
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
Highly intact, the Technical College Building at Mount Morgan State High School is important for its aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, landmark presence and streetscape contribution.
The building's symmetrically composed design, ordered street elevations, contrasting high-quality materials (stone and red facebrick), and assertive massing denote a place of learning and stability. Through its size, symmetry, form, materials and siting on a prominent corner along the Burnett Highway, it asserts a landmark presence in the townscape.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Schools and technical colleges have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.
Mount Morgan State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Mount Morgan community. Established in 1908 with the fundraising efforts of the local community, generations of Mount Morgan students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Mount Morgan and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Genoplesium validum

Genoplesium validum, commonly known as the Blackdown midge orchid, is a species of small terrestrial orchid that is endemic to the Blackdown Tableland National Park in Queensland. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty five greenish-brown flowers with reddish stripes and a hairy labellum. This species is treated as "Corunastylis valida" in Queensland.
Description.
"Genoplesium validum" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf with a reddish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between fifteen and thirty five flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are greenish-brown, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is elliptic to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and greenish with narrow, dark purplish bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark purplish bands. The labellum is elliptic to broadly oblong, about long, wide and dark purplish-black with its edges densely covered with short, coarse purplish hairs. There is a dark purplish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from December to April.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Genoplesium validum" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Corunastylis valida", a name that is accepted in Queensland but not by the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet ("validum") is a Latin word meaning "strong" or "powerful", referring to the robust habit of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The Blackdown midge orchid grows in sandy soil in rocky places on the Blackdown Tableland.

Cory Asbury

Cory Hunter Asbury is an American Christian musician, worship pastor and songwriter. He is a worship pastor at Radiant Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and is a member of the Bethel Music collective.
Starting as an intern with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005, Asbury's career as a musician grew as he collaborated with Matt Gilman leading to the release of "Holy" in 2008, followed by his first solo album, "Let Me See Your Eyes", in 2009 by Forerunner Music, and numerous appearances on IHOPKC albums, with songs such as "Where I Belong", "Shekinah", "All Is for Your Glory" and "Holy Ghost Party". In June 2012, Asbury moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to join New Life Church where he began as an associate worship pastor, becoming a member of its ensembles, Desperation Band and New Life Worship.
After signing with Bethel Music in 2015, Asbury made his first appearance with the Collective on "Have It All" (2016). He became more known with the release of "Reckless Love" in late 2017, a hit single that preceded his breakthrough second full-length album, also titled "Reckless Love", in early 2018 which was a commercially successful release, having charted in the United States and internationally. "Reckless Love" was nominated for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song in the 2019 Grammy Awards. His third studio album, "To Love a Fool", was released on July 31, 2020, which featured the singles, "The Father's House", "Sparrows", and "Dear God".
Early life.
Cory Asbury was born on October 15, 1985. Music affected him profoundly in his childhood, and he developed his songwriting ability growing up in North Carolina. Asbury began leading worship at his local church when he was seventeen years old. When Asbury finished high school at Franklin High School in 2004, he considered studying at UNC Chapel Hill, but his friends that graduated at the Onething internship with International House of Prayer (IHOPKC) in Kansas City persuaded Asbury to attend IHOPKC instead, so Asbury began his internship at IHOPKC on January 1, 2005, where he started his musical career.
Music and ministry career.
2005–2012: "Holy", "Let Me See Your Eyes" and IHOPKC releases.
Asbury began his career during his seven-year stay in Kansas City with the International House of Prayer, starting in the Onething internship program. He made his first appearance on an IHOPKC compilation titled "Immersed", released in December 2007, alongside several artists including Misty Edwards and David Brymer. Forerunner Music then released "Holy", a collaboration by Asbury with Matt Gilman, on July 10, 2008. The album consists of twelve tracks with Asbury and Gilman performing six each.
On September 1, 2009, Asbury released his first solo album with Forerunner Music, called "Let Me See Your Eyes", which included appearances by Jaye Thomas, Edwin Botero and Nathan Prior. Produced by Seth Yates, "Let Me See Your Eyes" is an indie pop collection which also incorporates various musical styles including soul, rap and electro. The song "My Beloved", which featured Jaye Thomas, had been released as Asbury's first single from the album in July 2009.
In 2010, Asbury was featured on two IHOPKC albums, "Where I Belong" by Onething Live and "Joy" by Forerunner Music, alongside Jaye Thomas and Laura Hackett Park, on both releases. The song "Shekinah", which Asbury performed live with Jaye Thomas and was released as a part of "Joy" in November, became their first "Billboard" chart entry, as it peaked at No. 11 on the Gospel Digital Song Sales chart. Released in 2011, Asbury appeared on "Before His Eyes" by Onething Live, performing "Reason to Dance".
On July 24, 2012, Onething Live released its third live album, "Magnificent Obsession", with Asbury featuring on "All Is for Your Glory" and "Never Gonna Leave Me Dry". This album was Onething Live's breakthrough release, with the album making its debut on "Billboard's" Christian Albums chart at No. 17, and on Heatseekers Albums chart at No 10, credited as IHOPKC Worship.
2012–2016: New Life Church, Bethel Music signing and Radiant Church.
After spending seven years at the International House of Prayer, Asbury and his family moved to Colorado Springs to join New Life Church where he assumed the role of associate worship pastor on June 1, 2012. He led worship on Sunday morning and the Sunday night services as well as the Desperation Student Ministries on Wednesdays. On August 13, 2013, New Life Worship released "Strong God", an album recorded live at New Life Church through Integrity Music, with Asbury singing "All to Him" and "Ascribe". "Strong God" peaked at No. 6 on "Billboard's" Christian Albums chart, and at No. 165 on the "Billboard" 200. Asbury also co-wrote "Fun" with Jon Egan and Jason Ingram for Desperation Band's live album, "Banner" (2014).
In May 2015, Asbury was signed by Bethel Music and became a part of its Artist Collective. On March 11, 2016, Bethel Music released its eighth live album, "Have It All", with Asbury singing on the song "Son of God", his first feature for Bethel. "Have It All" started at No. 2 on the "Billboard" Christian Albums Chart in its opening week with 25,000 copies sold, peaking at No. 12 on the "Billboard" 200. He has toured with Bethel Music and has also led worship at the Heaven Come Conference, an annual Bethel Music event launched in 2016. During his tenure there, he led worship during certain services organized at Bethel Church, the home base of Bethel Music in Redding, California.
In December 2016, Asbury moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he began serving as a worship pastor at Radiant Church.
2017–2020: "Reckless Love".
On October 27, 2017, Asbury released his second single, "Reckless Love", in the lead up to the issue of his second solo album. As the song grew in popularity and achieved commercial success with radio airplay weeks before its release date, his third album of the same name, "Reckless Love" was released on January 26, 2018, by Bethel Music. The album debuted at No. 1 on "Billboard's" Christian Albums chart with 11,000 equivalent album units sold in its first week, while reaching No. 53 on the all-encompassing "Billboard" 200 chart for the best-selling releases in the United States. The title track broke into the top ten of Hot Christian Songs as well, reaching No. 7 after massive gains in streaming and radio airplay. Asbury also peaked at No. 3 on "Billboard's" Emerging Artists chart. "Reckless Love" also broke through internationally as it topped the Official Christian &amp; Gospel Albums Chart in the United Kingdom, and peaked at No. 69 and 73 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart and the Schweizer Hitparade of Switzerland respectively. The song went on to top several Christian radio charts. It reached No. 1 on the Christian Songs chart, staying there for eighteen weeks. The song also peaked at No. 3 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. It was nominated for the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.
In January 2020, Cory Asbury released a new version of "Reckless Love" which featured Tori Kelly, and a devotional book titled "Reckless Love: A 40-Day Journey Into the Overwhelming, Never-Ending Love of God".
2020–present: "To Love a Fool".
On January 24, 2020, "The Father's House" was released as the lead single for his third solo album, "To Love a Fool". On the Hot Christian Songs chart, the song debuted at No. 16, peaking at No. 3 on the chart. Asbury released "Christ Be Magnified" as a standalone single on February 28, 2020. On April 4, 2020, Asbury and Bethel Music released "Egypt" as third single from Bethel Music's album, "Revival's in the Air" (2020). The song peaked at No. 36 on the Hot Christian Songs chart. "To Love a Fool" was released on July 31, 2020. "To Love a Fool" debuted at number four on the "Billboard" Top Christian Albums chart. On September 11, 2020, "Sparrows" was released to Christian radio in the United States as the second single from "To Love a Fool". "Sparrows" peaked at number 6 on Hot Christian Songs chart. Asbury released "Dear God" as the third single from "To Love a Fool", on October 23, 2020. "Dear God" debuted at number 34 on the Hot Christian Songs chart.
On November 6, 2020, Asbury released his first live album, "To Love a Fool – A Rooftop Experience", which contains live versions of the songs that initially appeared on "To Love a Fool" studio recording. The album debuted at number 20 on the Top Christian Albums Chart.
Asbury received two nominations for the 2021 GMA Dove Awards, being nominated for Song of the Year for "The Father's House" and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year for "To Love a Fool".

NASCAR Cup Series

The NASCAR Cup Series is the top racing series of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). The series began in 1949 as the Strictly Stock Division, and from 1950 to 1970 it was known as the Grand National Division. In 1971, when the series began leasing its naming rights to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was referred to as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (1971–2003). A similar deal was made with Nextel in 2003, and it became the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series (2004–2007). Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, and in 2008 the series was renamed the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (2008–2016). In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would become the new title sponsor and the series was renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (2017–2019). In 2019, NASCAR rejected Monster's offer to extend the current naming rights deal beyond the end of the season. NASCAR subsequently announced its move to a new tiered sponsorship model beginning with the 2020 season similar to other US based professional sports leagues, where it was simply known as the NASCAR Cup Series, with the sponsors of the series being called Premier Partners. The four Premier Partners are Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Xfinity.
The championship is determined by a points system, with points being awarded according to finish placement and number of laps led. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins. They compete in the last ten races, where the difference in points is greatly minimized. This is called the NASCAR playoffs.
The series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States, with about half of the races in the 36-race season being held in that region. the schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia. The Daytona 500, the most prestigious race, had a television audience of about 9.17 million U.S. viewers in 2019.
Cup Series cars are unique in automobile racing. The engines are powerful enough to reach speeds of over , but their weight coupled with a relatively simple aerodynamic package (based on the body styles of cars currently available for retail sale in the United States) make for poor handling. The bodies and chassis of the cars are strictly regulated to ensure parity, and electronics are traditionally spartan in nature.
History.
Strictly Stock and Grand National.
In 1949, NASCAR introduced the Strictly Stock division, after sanctioning Modified and Roadster division races in 1948. Eight races were run on seven dirt ovals and on the Daytona Beach beach/street course.
The first NASCAR "Strictly Stock" race was held at Charlotte Speedway on June 19, 1949. Jim Roper was declared the winner of that race after Glenn Dunaway was disqualified for having altered the rear springs on his car; the first series champion was Red Byron. The division was renamed "Grand National" for the 1950 season, reflecting NASCAR's intent to make the sport more professional and prestigious. It retained this name until 1971. The 1949 Strictly Stock season is regarded in NASCAR's record books as the first season of GN/Cup history. Martinsville Speedway is the only track on the 1949 schedule that remains on the current schedule.
Rather than having a fixed schedule of one race per weekend with most entrants appearing at every event, the Grand National schedule has included over sixty events in some years. Often there are two or three races on the same weekend and occasionally two races on the same day in different states.
In the early years, most Grand National races were held on dirt-surfaced short oval tracks that ranged in lap length from under a quarter-mile to over a half-mile, or on dirt fairgrounds ovals usually ranging from a half-mile to a mile in lap length. Of the first 221 Grand National races, 198 were run on dirt tracks. Darlington Raceway, opened in 1950, was the first completely paved track on the circuit over long. In 1959, when Daytona International Speedway was opened, the schedule still had more races on dirt racetracks than on paved ones. In the 1960s as superspeedways were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of races run on dirt tracks was reduced.
The last NASCAR Grand National race on a dirt track (until 2021) was held on September 30, 1970, at the half-mile State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh, North Carolina. Richard Petty won that race in a Plymouth that had been sold by Petty Enterprises to Don Robertson and rented back by Petty Enterprises for the race.
Winston Cup.
Between 1971 and 2003, NASCAR's premier series was sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston, dubbing it the Winston Cup Series. The series was originally called the Winston Cup Grand National Series before "Grand National" was dropped in 1986. In 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned television advertising of cigarettes. As a result, tobacco companies began to sponsor sporting events as a way to spend their excess advertising dollars and to circumvent the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act's ban on television advertising. RJR's sponsorship became more controversial in the wake of the 1998 Tobacco Industry Settlement that sharply restricted avenues for tobacco advertising, including sports sponsorships.
The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement in the series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's "modern era". The season was made shorter, and the points system was modified several times during the next four years. Races on dirt tracks and on oval tracks shorter than were removed from the schedule and transferred to the short-lived NASCAR Grand National East Series, and the remaining races had a minimum prize money of $30,000. NASCAR's founder, Bill France Sr., turned over control of NASCAR to his oldest son, Bill France Jr. In August 1974, France Jr. asked series publicist Bob Latford to design a points system with equal points being awarded for all races regardless of length or prize money. This system ensured that the top drivers would have to compete in all the races in order to become the series champion. This system remained unchanged from 1975 until the Chase for the Championship was instituted in 2004.
Since 1982, the Daytona 500 has been the first non-exhibition race of the year.
ABC Sports aired partial or full live telecasts of Grand National races from Talladega, North Wilkesboro, Darlington, Charlotte, and Nashville in 1970. Because these events were perceived as less exciting than many Grand National races, ABC abandoned its live coverage. Races were instead broadcast, delayed and edited, on the ABC sports variety show "Wide World of Sports".
In 1979, the Daytona 500 became the first stock car race that was nationally televised live from flag to flag on CBS. The leaders going into the last lap, Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, wrecked on the backstretch while dicing for the lead, allowing Richard Petty to pass them both for the win. Immediately, Yarborough, Allison, and Allison's brother Bobby were engaged in a fistfight on national television. This underlined the drama and emotion of the sport and increased its broadcast marketability. The race coincided with a major snowstorm along the United States' eastern seaboard, successfully introducing the sport to a captive audience.
In 1981, an awards banquet began to be held in New York City on the first Friday evening in December. The first banquets were held in the Waldorf-Astoria's Starlight Room and in 1985 were moved to the much larger Grand Ballroom. But in 2001, the banquet portion was dropped in favor of a simpler awards ceremony. And in 2002, the awards ceremony was moved to the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center. However, in 2003, the festivities returned to the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom, and the banquet format was reinstated.
In 1985, Winston introduced a new awards program called the Winston Million. From 1985 to 1997, any driver who won three of the four most prestigious races in the series was given one million dollars. The prize was only won twice; Bill Elliott won in 1985, Darrell Waltrip nearly won in 1989, Davey Allison nearly won in 1992, Dale Jarrett nearly won in 1996, and Jeff Gordon won in 1997. The Winston Million was replaced with a similar program, the Winston No Bull Five, in 1998. This program awarded one million dollars to any driver who won a prestigious race after finishing in the top five of the most previous prestigious race.
The series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s. In 1994, NASCAR held the first Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Between 1997 and 1998, the winner's prize money for the Daytona 500 tripled. This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing.
In 1999, NASCAR made a new agreement with Fox Broadcasting, Turner Broadcasting, and NBC. The contract, signed for eight years for Fox and six years for NBC and Turner, was valued at $2.4 billion.
In 2001, Pixar visited NASCAR tracks as research for the 2006 animated film "Cars", which included the voices of NASCAR drivers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr. To avoid advertising tobacco in a Disney film, "Piston Cup" served as Pixar's allusion to the Winston Cup. Despite the fact that by 2006 the series was renamed to the Nextel Cup.
Nextel and Sprint.
At the end of 2003, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's sponsorship contract expired, and NASCAR negotiated a contract with Nextel, a telecommunications company. In 2004, the series became known as the Nextel Cup Series.
The 2006 merger between Sprint and Nextel resulted in the Cup Series being renamed the Sprint Cup, beginning with the 2008 season.
The Sprint Cup trophy was designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. and is silver, with a pair of checkered flags in flight.
By 2009, the popularity boom of the 1990s had ended, and television ratings over the previous ten years had become more or less stagnant. Some long-time fans have criticized the series for losing its traditional appeal because of abandoning venues in the southeastern United States in favor of newer markets. They have also voiced discontent over Toyota's presence in the series. Japanese telecommunications corporation SoftBank acquired Sprint in July 2013. While NASCAR was suspicious of diversity promotion and aware of the negative implications of the redneck image, it also recognized the opportunities to expand the sport. NASCAR's CEO Brian France has become a prime target for criticism among fans during his tenure from 2003 to 2018.
In 2016, NASCAR announced the creation of a charter system (in association with the Race Team Alliance, formed in 2014), which would guarantee 36 teams' entry to all 36 races. Eligibility for a charter would depend on a team's attempts to qualify for every race within the previous three seasons. In conjunction with this rule, NASCAR also reduced the size of the Cup field to 40 cars.
Chase for the Cup.
Along with the change in title sponsorship for the series, the 2004 season also introduced a new system for determining the series champion, influenced by the system used in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series.
Originally known as the "Chase for the Nextel Cup" (or simply "The Chase", and later changed to Sprint branding), the ten highest-scoring drivers and teams (plus ties) in the first 26 races of the season became eligible to win the championship by competing in a playoff held within the final ten races. This number was increased to 12 teams in 2007. The Chase participants had their points increased to a level mathematically unattainable by anyone outside this field (roughly 1,800 points ahead of the first driver outside the Chase). From the inaugural Chase in 2004 to the 2006 Chase, the drivers were seeded based on points position at the end of the regular season, with first place starting with 5,050 points and tenth place starting with 5,005. From 2007 to 2010, the points totals of each driver who made the Chase were reset to 5,000 points, plus ten additional points for each race victory during the first 26 races. Points would still be awarded as usual during the affected races. The driver leading in points after the 36th race would be declared the champion.
As part of a major change in the points system that took effect in 2011, the qualifying criteria and the points reset were changed as well. From 2011 to 2013, the ten drivers with the most points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two "wild card" qualifiers, specifically, the two drivers with the most race wins who were ranked between 11th and 20th in drivers' points. Their base point totals were then reset to 2,000 points, a level more than 1,000 points higher than that of the first driver outside the Chase. (Under the new point system, a race winner can earn a maximum of 48 points, as opposed to 195 in the pre-2011 system.) The ten automatic qualifiers received a bonus of three points for each win during the regular season, while the two wild card qualifiers received no such bonus. As in the past, the race layouts for the remaining ten races were the same, with no changes to the scoring system. On November 20, 2011, Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards ended the season in a first-ever points tie. Stewart's five season wins (all in the Chase) over Edwards' one win (in the third race of the season) gave Stewart the tie-breaker. Hence he was named the winner of the 2011 NASCAR Cup Series Championship.
For 2014, NASCAR announced wide-ranging changes to the Chase format:
To encourage continued competition among all drivers, a number of awards are given to drivers finishing outside the Chase. The highest finishing non-Chase driver (13th place at the end of the season from 2007 to 2013 and potentially anywhere from fifth to 17th place starting in 2014) is awarded a bonus of approximately one million dollars and was originally given a position on stage at the post-season awards banquet. The awards banquet now focuses solely on the Chase, with all of the series' sponsored and contingency awards moved to a luncheon at Cipriani the day before the banquet.
This playoff system was implemented primarily to make the points race more competitive late in the season, and indirectly, to increase television ratings during the NFL season, which starts around the same time as the Chase begins. The Chase also forces teams to perform at their best during all three stages of the season, the first half of the regular season, the second half of the regular season, and the Chase.
Previously, the champion could have been determined before the last race, or even several races before the end of the season, because it was mathematically impossible for any other driver to gain enough points to overtake the leader.
Monster Energy.
The title sponsorship with Sprint ended after the 2016 season. On December 1, 2016, NASCAR announced it had reached an agreement with Monster Energy to become the new sponsor of NASCAR's premier series. On December 19, 2016, NASCAR announced the new name for the series, Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as well as the new series logo and new NASCAR logo. On April 11, 2018, Monster Energy announced an extension of their sponsorship of the series through the end of the 2019 season.
In 2017, stage racing was introduced. Races were broken up into three stages, four in the case of the NASCAR Cup Series' longest race, the Coca-Cola 600. A stage consists of normal green flag racing followed by a stoppage on a designated lap signified by the waving of a green and white checkered flag, then a yellow flag. The top-10 finishers in each of the first two stages are awarded bonus championship points, 10 points to the winner, 9 points for the 2nd place car, down to 1 point for the 10th place car. The points earned are added to a driver/owner's regular season points total, while the winner of the stage receives an additional point that is added to their point total, after the reset, if they get into the NASCAR playoffs. The stage lengths vary by track, but the first two stages usually combine to equal about half of the race. The final stage (which still pays out championship points to all drivers) usually equals the other half. Also, a regular season points championship is awarded to the driver who scored the most points in the first 26 races (regular season). This championship does not award any bonus points to the winning driver. Otherwise, the points system and playoff format remained the same.
The MENCS trophy was in the form of a chalice that stood at three feet tall and weighed 68 lbs. Made of machined aluminum and taking over 300 hours of craftsmanship, the trophy's exterior was decorated with the outlines of all 23 NASCAR Cup Series tracks. The cup portion was said to hold approximately 600 ounces of liquids, or 37 cans of Monster Energy.
NASCAR Cup Series.
Beginning with the 2020 season NASCAR's top level of competition became known as the NASCAR Cup Series. As part of a tiered sponsorship model, Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Xfinity became the Premier Partners of the series, with Coca-Cola also assuming naming rights of the regular season trophy.
The MENCS trophy design was retained under the new series name, though it was renamed the Bill France Cup.
Drivers' Championship.
The NASCAR Cup Series Drivers' Championship is awarded by the Chairman of NASCAR to the most successful Cup Series driver over a season, as determined by a points system based on race results and victories. First awarded in 1949 to Red Byron, 32 different drivers have won the Championship. The first driver to win multiple Championships was Herb Thomas in 1951 and 1953, while the record for the most Championships, seven, is shared by Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson. Johnson has the record for most consecutive Championships; he won five Championships from 2006 to 2010. So far every Champion has originated from the United States.
Owners' Championship.
The Cup Series Owner's Championship operates in the same manner as the Driver's Championship, except that points are awarded to each individual car. If an owner enters more than one car, each car is viewed and scored as a separate entity. The points in the Owners Championship is identical to the Drivers' list, with one minor exception: Drivers who are not eligible to earn points toward the Drivers' title can still earn points toward the Owners' Championship. An example of this occurred in the first race under the current points system, the 2011 Daytona 500. Under another rule newly implemented for the 2011 season, drivers are only allowed to earn drivers' points in one of NASCAR's three national series. Trevor Bayne, who won the race, did not earn any drivers' points because he chose to run for the Nationwide Series championship. However, he earned 47 owner's points for Wood Brothers Racing (43 base points, three bonus points for the win, and one bonus point for leading a lap).
Before a major change to the points system was implemented in 2011, there was a slightly different addition to the system of allocating owner's points. If more than 43 cars attempted to qualify for a race, owner's points were awarded to each car in the following manner: the fastest non-qualifier (in essence, 44th position) received 31 points, three points fewer than the car in the 43rd position. If more than one car did not qualify, owners' points continued to be assigned in the manner described, decreasing by three for each position. Under the post-2010 point system, only cars that actually start in a given race earn owner's points.
There is a separate "Chase for the Championship" for the owners' points.
A 2005 rule change in NASCAR's three national series, revoked from 2013 onward, affects how the owner's points are used. Through the 2012 season, the top 35 (NASCAR Cup Series) or top 30 (other series) full-time teams in owner points are awarded exemptions for the next race, guaranteeing them a position in that race. These points determine who is in and who is out of the next race and have become crucial since the exemption rule was changed to its current format. At the end of each season, the top 35 contenders in owner's points are also locked into the first five races of the next season.
Beginning in 2013, the rules reverted to a system more similar to the pre-2005 rules. In the NASCAR Cup Series, the first 36 places in the field are determined strictly by qualifying speed. The next six places are awarded on owner points, with the final place reserved for a past Series Champion. If the final exemption is not used because all past Champions are already in the field, it will pass to another car based on the number of owner points.
In some circumstances, a team's owners' points will differ from the corresponding driver's points. In 2005, after owner Jack Roush fired Kurt Busch during the next-to-last race weekend of the season, the No. 97 team finished in eighth place in owner's points, while Busch ended up tenth in driver's points. In 2002, when Sterling Marlin was injured, the No. 40 team finished eighth in owner's points, while Marlin was 18th in driver's points, because of substitute drivers Jamie McMurray and Mike Bliss, who continued to earn owner points for the No. 40. Another example was in the aforementioned 2011 Daytona 500.
Manufacturers' Championship.
A Manufacturer's Championship is awarded each year, although the Driver's Championship is considered more prestigious. In the past, manufacturer's championships were prestigious because of the number of manufacturers involved, and the manufacturer's championship was a major marketing tool. In the Xfinity Series, the championship is known as the Bill France Performance Cup.
Up to the 2013 season, points were scored in a 1960–1990 Formula One system, with the winner's manufacturer scoring nine points, six for the next manufacturer, four for the manufacturer third among makes, three for the fourth, two for the fifth, and one point for the sixth positioned manufacturer. This meant that if Chevrolets placed first through tenth in a given race and a Ford was 11th and a Dodge 12th, Chevrolet earned 9 points, Ford 6 and Dodge 4. Starting in 2014, NASCAR changed the system to mimic the Owner's Championship. Under this system, each manufacturer's best finishing representative effectively earned them the same number of points as that team earned, including any bonus points from leading a lap or winning the event.
Representation.
In NASCAR's earliest years, there was a diverse array of machinery, with little support from the car companies themselves, but by the mid 1960s, participation was exclusively American manufacturers with factory support. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were the primary, if not only, competitors for much of NASCAR's history. Plymouth, while somewhat successful in the 1960s with the Hemi, never won a Manufacturers Championship until Ford pulled out of racing in the early 1970s. GM was still using four different brands in NASCAR in 1991, but within three years, Buick and Oldsmobile were gone. Pontiac survived until 2004, leaving only Chevrolet. 2007 saw the first new brand since 1971, when Japanese manufacturer Toyota joined. Chrysler's Dodge brand returned after a 15-year hiatus in 2001, but departed after 2012, leaving just Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota.
Chevrolet has been the most successful manufacturer as of August 2015, with 749 race wins and 38 manufacturers championships. Ford ranks second with 636 victories and 15 manufacturers championships. Dodge is third in wins with 217, Plymouth fourth with 190, and Pontiac fifth with 155. Toyota currently ranks 9th all time, with 74 victories.
Cup cars.
Cup Series cars (often called "Cup cars") adhere to a front engine rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis and is covered by a 24-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear spoiler, and an aerodynamic splitter. Fielding a car for one season usually costs $10–20 million. Each team may build its own cars and engines (per NASCAR's specifications) or purchase cars and engines from other teams.
The cars are powered by EFI V8 engines since 2012 after 62 years using carburetion as engine fuel feed with compacted graphite iron blocks and pushrod valvetrains actuating two-valves per cylinder, and are limited to 358 cubic inches' (about 5.8 liters) displacement. However, modern technology has allowed power outputs near in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design. In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm. A NASCAR Cup Series engine with the maximum bore of and stroke of at 9,000 rpm has a mean piston speed of 80.44 fps (24.75 m/s). Contemporary Cup engines run 9,800 rpm, 87.59 fps (26.95 m/s), at the road course events, on Pocono Raceway's long front stretch, and at Martinsville Speedway (a .526-mile short-track). At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 9,200-9,400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race. The current NASCAR Cup engines curb weight is roughly at .
The front suspension is a double wishbone design, while the rear suspension is a two-link live axle design utilizing trailing arms. Brake rotors must be made of magnetic cast iron or steel and may not exceed 12.72 inches (32.3 centimeters) in diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, spoiler, NACA ducts in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays is strictly prohibited. While the cars may reach speeds of about on certain tracks, Russ Wicks drove a stock car built to NASCAR's specifications during a speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 2007.
NASCAR Cup Series engines carry a Freescale-provided electronic control unit, but traction control and anti-lock brakes are prohibited. Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track.
Cup cars are required to have at least one working windshield wiper installed on the car for the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, and the Roval at the Charlotte Motor Speedway) as part of the road racing rules package.
Evolution of Cup cars.
Generation 1 (1948-1964).
When the series was formed under the name "strictly stock", the cars were just that: production vehicles with no modifications allowed. The term "stock car" implied that the vehicles racing were unmodified street cars. Drivers would race with factory installed bench seats and AM radios still in the cars. To prevent broken glass from getting on the race track, windows would be rolled down, external lights would be removed or taped over, and wing mirrors would be removed. The 1957 fuel injected 150 model Chevrolet (known as "the black widow") was the first car to be outlawed by NASCAR. The 1957 Chevrolet won the most races, with 59 wins, more than any car to ever race in the cup series. Before the mid-1960s, cars were typically based on full sized cars such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie
Generation 2 (1965-1980).
In 1965, modified chaises came to the sport. In 1966, mid-size cars including the Ford Fairlane and Plymouth Belvedere were adopted and soon became the norm. NASCAR once enforced a homologation rule that at various times stated that at least 500 cars had to be produced, or as many as one car for every make's dealership in the nation had to be sold to the general public to allow it to be raced. Eventually, cars were made expressly for NASCAR competition, including the Ford Torino Talladega, which had a rounded nose, and the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbird which had a rear wing raised above roof level and a shark shaped nose-cap which enabled race speeds of exactly 200 mph. The Ford-based Mercury Spoiler powered by a Ford Boss 429 engine was timed at 199.6 mph. Beginning in 1971, NASCAR rewrote the rules to effectively force the Ford and Chrysler specialty cars out of competition by limiting them to 305ci (5.0L). The cars affected by this rule include the Ford Talladega, Mercury Spoiler II, Dodge Charger 500, Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird. This rule was so effective in limiting performance that only one car that season ever attempted to run in this configuration.
In 1971, NASCAR handicapped the larger engines with a restrictor plate. By 1972, NASCAR phased in a rule to lower the maximum engine displacement from 429 cubic inches (7.0 liters) to its present 358 cubic inches (5.8 liters). The transition was not complete until 1974 and coincided with American manufacturers ending factory support of racing and the 1973 oil crisis.
Generation 3 (1981–1992).
The downsizing of American cars in the late 1970s presented a challenge for NASCAR. Rules mandated a minimum wheelbase of , but after 1979, none of the models approved for competition met the standard, as mid-sized cars now typically had wheelbases between 105 and 112 inches. After retaining the older models (1977 for the GM makes, and 1979 for Ford and Dodge) through 1980, for the 1981 season the wheelbase requirement was reduced to , which the newer model cars could be stretched to meet without affecting their appearance. The Buick Regal with its swept-back "shovel" nose initially dominated competition, followed by the rounded, aerodynamic 1983 Ford Thunderbird. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix adopted bubble back windows to stay competitive. Amid its financial woes, and after dropping its poor performing (both on the race track and for consumer sales) Dodge Mirada and Chrysler Cordoba in 1983, Chrysler Corporation left NASCAR entirely at the end of the 1985 season.
1987 marked a milestone for NASCAR Cup Series cars. During Winston 500 qualifying, Bill Elliott established a world stock-car record when he posted a speed of . Then the unfortunate happened; during the 22nd lap of the race, driver Bobby Allison suffered a flat tire in the middle of Talladega Superspeedway's tri-oval. Allison's car hit the catch fence and tore a hole in the fence approximately long. Several spectators were injured in the accident, including one woman who lost an eye. In the aftermath of the crash, NASCAR mandated the use of a restrictor plate at Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway to reduce speeds. By 1989, GM had switched its mid-sized models to V6 engines and front-wheel-drive, but the NASCAR racers only kept the body shape, with the old V8 rear-wheel-drive running gear, rendering obsolete the "stock" nature of the cars.
Generation 4 (1993–2007).
1993 marked the beginning of the generation that stripped all semblance of "stock" from "stock car racing," the Generation 4 car. The led shot was replaced by the led ingot, the fuel mileage was cut for the drivers to lead more laps, and the bumpers, nose, and tail were composed of molded fiberglass based on production counterparts. When the Ford Thunderbird was retired after 1997, without Ford having any two-door intermediate bodies, the four-door Ford Taurus body was used (although NASCAR racers actually have no opening doors).
While the manufacturers and models of automobiles used in racing were named for production cars (Dodge Charger R/T, Chevrolet Impala SS, Toyota Camry, and the Ford Fusion), the similarities between NASCAR Cup Series cars and actual production cars were limited to a small amount of shaping and painting of the nose, headlight and tail light decals, and grill areas. Until 2003, the hood, roof, and decklid were still required to be identical to their stock counterparts.
It was in this time that NASCAR engaged in the practice of mandating rule changes during the season if one particular car model became overly dominant. This often led to claims that some teams would attempt sandbagging to receive more favorable handicaps.
Because of the notorious manner of the Ford Taurus race car and how the manufacturer turned the car into an "offset" car (the car was notoriously asymmetrical in race trim because of its oval shape), NASCAR ended this practice to put more emphasis on parity and based new body rules in 2003, similar to short track racing, where offset cars had become a burden for race officials, resulting in the "Approved Body Configuration" design.
Car of Tomorrow (2007–2012).
In 2007, NASCAR introduced a radically new vehicle specification known as the "Car of Tomorrow" (CoT). The CoT made its debut at Bristol Motor Speedway in March 2007. Initially, it was only used at 16 selected events. While NASCAR had originally planned to wait until the start of the 2009 season to use the CoT in every race, the date was changed to the start of the 2008 season. Many drivers still had complaints about the CoT, but this new timeline was intended to help teams save money by giving them only one car specification to work on.
The design of the CoT has focused on cost control, parity, and driver safety. The car's width was increased by 4 inches (10 centimeters), the bumpers were re-designed to render bump and run tactics less effective, and the height of the car has increased by 2 inches (5 centimeters) to accommodate taller drivers and increase aerodynamic drag. The driver's seat was moved closer to the center of the car. The change most notable to fans was the addition of a rear wing replacing the familiar spoiler. The wings could be adjusted between 0 and 16 degrees and used with multiple configurations of end plates.
The new rules eliminate the asymmetrical bodies on cars, which had run rampant since the 1998 Taurus release. However, almost all advantages of using one car over another have been nullified. NASCAR requires all CoTs to conform to common body templates, regardless of make and model.
The rear wing remained a controversial feature for a few years. Its appearance was often criticized, and it was accused of forcing cars to become airborne in high-speed spins such as the one experienced by Carl Edwards during the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010 NASCAR decided to replace the wing with the original spoiler. The switch began with the 2010 Goody's Fast Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway.
In 2011, NASCAR altered the nose of the car once more, with the splitter being reduced in size and the braces being replaced by a solid front valence.
A major engine change occurred in 2012 with NASCAR's introduction of fuel injection technology. Initially NASCAR indicated that it would transition to fuel injection midway through the 2011 season but decided before that season to put off the change until 2012.
Generation 6 car (2013–2021).
In 2013, manufacturers were given increased leeway for branding their NASCAR Cup Series cars, creating the Generation Six race car. These changes were made so the cars would resemble their street counterparts more closely, as was done in the Xfinity Series in 2011.
All NASCAR Cup Series cars began utilizing a digital dash sold by McLaren in 2016. This dash includes sixteen customizable preset screens, allowing the driver to monitor all the previous info with several additional elements such as lap time and engine diagnostics, for a total of twenty-four data elements. Information can be displayed as a gauge, numeral, bar graph or LED.
Setup.
The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and aerodynamic components are also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks. A car that understeers is said to be "tight", or "pushing", causing the car to keep going up the track with the wheel turned all the way left, while one that oversteers is said to be "loose" or "free", causing the back end of the car to slide around, which can result in the car spinning out if the driver is not careful. The adjustment of front and rear aerodynamic downforce, spring rates, track bar geometry, brake proportioning, the wedge (also known as cross-weight), changing the camber angle, and changing the air pressure in the tires can all change the distribution of forces among the tires during cornering to correct for handling problems. Recently, coil bind setups have become popular among teams.
These characteristics are also affected by tire stagger (tires of different circumference at different positions on the car, the right rear having the most influence in left turns) and rubber compounds used in tire construction. These settings are determined by NASCAR and Goodyear engineers and may not be adjusted by individual teams.
Changing weather conditions may also affect a car's handling. In a long race, it is sometimes advantageous to prepare a car to handle well at the end of an event while surrendering the advantage of speed at the start. On oval races, rain forces a race to be halted immediately. NASCAR had developed rain tires for Cup Series road racing as early as late 1990s, but initially abandoned them because there at the time were not enough road courses on the schedule to justify the cost of making more tires to replace them as they aged. The first in-race use of rain tires in the Cup Series were at the 2020 Bank of America Roval 400 and the 2021 Texas Grand Prix. Prior to these, a 1956 race at Road America was held in rain; Tim Flock won the race.
Cup tracks.
Presently, the NASCAR Cup Series is held mainly in eastern states, with only six tracks located west of the Mississippi River. Cup Series races are not conducted on standardized tracks; the 2017 season included 21 oval tracks and 2 road courses. The lap length of the oval tracks vary from at Martinsville Speedway to at Talladega Superspeedway. The majority of the oval tracks are paved with asphalt, while 3 tracks are wholly or partially paved with concrete. Although the series historically raced on dirt tracks, it ceased to do so for more than 50 years after the 1970 season. In 2021, dirt racing returned to the schedule with a March event at Bristol Motor Speedway.
While some tracks are true ovals, such as Bristol Motor Speedway, over half the tracks currently in Cup competition are a form of tri-oval. Other configurations include Darlington Raceway's characteristic uneven "egg" shape, the triangular Pocono Raceway, and the rectangle of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
While NASCAR is known for primarily running counter-clockwise on oval tracks, Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International are complex road courses which are raced clockwise. The series' first road course event was held in 1954, at Linden Airport in New Jersey. Since 1963, the series has raced on at least one road course every year.
Courses have a wide range of banking in the corners. New Hampshire Motor Speedway, with 7 degrees of banking, has the flattest corners, while the steepest banking is Talladega Superspeedway's 33 degrees. Tracks also vary in amount of banking on the straightaways, from entirely flat on many courses to 9 degrees at Dover International Speedway.
Race speeds vary widely depending on the track. The fastest track is Talladega Superspeedway, where the record average speed is and the record qualifying lap is , set by Bill Elliott in 1987. The record stands unlikely to be broken, as restrictor plates were made mandatory at superspeedways in 1988 to reduce speeds, and the plates were then replaced in 2019 by tapered spacers which still reduced enough horsepower to prevent cars from going beyond speed of 205 mph. The slowest tracks are Sonoma Raceway, a road course with a record average speed of only and a record qualifying lap of , and Martinsville Speedway, a short, nearly flat "paper clip" oval, with a record average speed of and a record qualifying lap of . The average speed of a race is determined by dividing the winner's race time (from the waving of the green flag to the waving of the checkered flag, including laps spent under caution) by the distance of the race. Time elapsed during red flag periods is not included in the calculation of the average speed.

Dhusha

Dhusha is a village Development Committee in Dhading District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 7190. The Dhusha VDC office is located at Charaundi Bazar, which is one of the Commencing place of the White Water Rafting in Trishuli River which started longway back. The bazar is also the main business area for the whole VDC which is located along the Prithvi Highway. Like the general geographical status of the whole country, Dhusha rises from low altitude to medium - high altitude region. Charaundi Khola (Charaundi Stream), flows very close to the bazar.
Dhusha proudly boasts as it is one of the few VDCs in the country which serves the country producing tonnes and tonnes of vegetables all the year round which mainly comprises Cabbage, Brinjal, Bitter Gourd, Tomato etc. The vegetable that are collected at Dhusha Agricultural Produce Collection Center in Charaundi Bazar, are sent to Kalimati Vegetable Market in Kathmandu and also various cities and towns in the country including Mugling, Narayanghat, Pokhara, Biratnagar, Dharan. The agriculture development and production also helped to ethnic community likes of Chepang Community.
Tourism can be the next source of income in the VDC as the area is rich with natural resources. White water rafting is the main attraction in the area. "Trishuli River", which is one of the famous river for White Water Rafting in the country, flows in between Dhusha (Dhading District) and Ghyalchowk VDC (Gorkha District). The main rafting spots which are within the VDC are just 80 km (approx.) with some good resorts (Royal Beach Camp, Himalika Camp/Resort etc.)mainly targeted for tourist are opened in the area. The VDC is just 80 km (approx.) from Kathmandu, the capital city. "Nohak Gupha (Nohak Cave)" also lies within the VDC which can be one of the longest cave in the country though it is yet to be publicized and verified. Canyoning in also a major attraction for local and foreign tourist in the VDC. It's one of the gateway to the Chitwan District via walking trail.

Evelyn Thomas Butts

Evelyn Thomas Butts (May 22, 1924 - March 11, 1993) was an African American civil rights activist and politician in Virginia. She is best known for challenging the poll tax and took her case before the United States Supreme Court. Butts was part of the civil rights movement and later became an influential member of Norfolk politics.
Early life.
Evelyn Thomas was born May 22, 1924, in Norfolk, Virginia. When she was ten years old, her mother, Lottie Cornick Thomas, died and she was adopted and raised by a politically active aunt. She married Charles Herbert Butts in 1941 and her husband served in World War II. The couple had three daughters together. When Charles retired due to a war-injury, Butts worked as a seamstress and took in boarders to make money. The Butts family moved to the Oakwood neighborhood of Norfolk and Butts became the president of the neighborhood's civic league.
Civil rights activism.
Butts became involved in the civil rights movement in the 1950s. During her time as the Oakwood Civic League, she helped create the Rosemont Middle School in her neighborhood so that children would not have to ride the bus to the segregated school. In 1960, she was involved in picketing the Be-Lo Supermarket for not employing black people in higher-level positions. She also protested against black people being told to sit in certain parts of the football stadium. In 1961, Butts was chosen to run against the incumbent president of the Norfolk NAACP. However, Butts withdrew when it became clear she would lose.
Butts and her lawyer, Joseph A. Jordan Jr., sued the state of Virginia for requiring the poll tax, filing in November 1963. Butts' case was that the tax was unconstitutional since it imposed an "undue financial burden" that violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. In March 1964, this first case was dismissed, but Butts filed another case and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tax. Butts appealed the case and the United States Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal in October 1965. Butts' case was combined with a similar case filed by Annie E. Harper, which reached the Supreme Court first. The case, "Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections", was decided in March 1966, making poll taxes unconstitutional.
After the Supreme Court decision, Butts went on to register black voters in Norfolk, signing up 2,882 "in one six month period." Butts, along with Jordan and other community leaders, helped create the Concerned Citizens for Political Education group, which became a powerful political force in local politics in the 1970s.
Political career.
Butts was appointed the commissioner of the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) in 1975. She would serve on the NRHA for twelve years. In 1982, she was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Housing and Community Development.
Butts ran for city council in Norfolk three times in 1980, 1982 and in 1984, but was never successful. Also in 1984, Butts was a witness in a court trial where she supported an at-large election system in Norfolk.
Butts was forced into retirement from politics in 1990 when she was ousted as the chair of the Concerned Citizens for Political Education. Butts died in her home on March 11, 1993. She is buried in Norfolk's Forest Lawn Cemetery.
Legacy.
On November 1995, Norfolk named a street in her honor. On March 27, 1996, the city held a celebration to mark the 30th anniversary of the poll tax repeal. During the celebration, they honored Butts and other activists involved. In 2017, Butts' daughter, Charlene Butts Ligon, published a book about her mother called "Fearless: How a Poor Virginia Seamstress Took on Jim Crow, Beat the Poll Tax and Changed Her City Forever". The "New Journal and Guide" called the book "thoughtful and information-filled." The book provides intimate details of Butts' life and her activism as seen through her daughter's eyes.

Investments and activist campaigns.
In 2011, Starboard won seats on the boards of SurModics, a maker of biopharmaceuticals, and Regis, a chain of hair-cutting salons.
In December 2011, Starboard sought to gain seats on AOL's board, charging that the firm's CEO, Tim Armstrong, was "wasting money by funding the losses at Patch, a network of local-news websites," and calling on Armstrong to "return to shareholders much of the more than $1 billion it received from the sale of its patents to Microsoft in 2012." Although Starboard lost a proxy battle six months later, Armstrong followed Starboard's advice, spinning off Patch and returning the $1 billion from Microsoft to its shareholders. Consequently, the value of Starboard's AOL stock more than doubled.
After accumulating a 15% stake in Office Depot, Starboard asked for its CEO, Neil Austrian, to be fired, and urged that the firm complete its merger with Office Max. Office Depot gave Starboard three board seats. Starboard also called for a merger between Office Depot and Staples, but the Federal Trade Commission ruled against it for anti-trust reasons, and a judge agreed with the FTC's verdict.
In November 2017, Starboard Value took a 10.7% stake in Mellanox Technologies, an Israeli semiconductor firm. Asserting that Mellanox was spending too much on research and development and other expenses, Starboard urged the company to improve its margins. In January 2018, Starboard Value tried to remove the entire Mellanox board.
In December 2017, Starboard Value bought a 9.9% stake in Cars.com, which it considered to be undervalued and potentially salable.
In August 2018, Starboard Value disclosed that it had accumulated a 5.8% stake in Symantec and had nominated five directors to Symantec's board. Symantec responded that it was evaluating the Starboard nominations and had not yet scheduled its 2018 Annual Meeting. In September 2018, Symantec announced that three nominees of Starboard were joining the Symantec board, two with immediate effect (including Starboard Managing Member Peter Feld) and one following the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
In addition, Starboard has taken activist positions in Smithfield Foods, Calgon Carbon, Tessera Technologies, Yahoo, Brink's Home Security, Macy's, Darden Restaurants, and Papa John's Pizza.
Darden takeover.
In October 2014, after what William D. Cohan of "Fortune" Magazine described as a "brilliantly executed campaign" involving "withering public criticism" of the firm's leadership and "careful courtship" of its major shareholders, Smith effectively took control of Darden Restaurants, a Fortune 500 company that owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse. Among Smith's criticisms was that the pasta at Olive Garden was inadequately salted. On the HBO program Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver did a three-minute comedy bit based on Starboard's presentation. As of February 1, 2018, it had been seen by nearly four million viewers. While owning less than 10% of the firm, Smith replaced the entire board and became Darden's chairman. By doing so, wrote Cohan, Smith "fired a shot over the bows of directors everywhere," informing them that shareholders were now in the ascendant, and "managers ignore them at their peril." According to Cohan, "the scope of Smith's triumph with Darden has left jaws hanging open across Wall Street and beyond. Only in a handful of times in the past few years has an activist managed to replace an entire board of directors, and never at a company the size of Darden." After Starboard took over Darden, its stock went up by almost 60%.
Profitability.
From 2002 to 2014, Starboard generated annualized returns of 15.5%. Fully 84% of its activist campaigns have been profitable. Since 2004, Starboard has replaced over 80 directors on about 30 boards.

As described in a review of the film in a film magazine, Hattie Lou Harkness’ (Bellamy) life with her aunt becomes unbearable and she runs away from the country home, finding employment as a maid with the wealthy Van Gores. Spencer Van Gore (Cooley) stages a mock wedding on board his yacht with the ship’s captain officiating. Learning of the trick, Hattie Lou leaves. Two years later she is out of work. Reading that the yacht has been wrecked and the party of Van Gores lost, she goes with her baby to the elder Van Gore’s home and poses as Spencer’s wife. Grant Van Gore (Bowers), a war invalid there, falls in love with her. Spencer turns up and Hattie Lou learns that the marriage was legal and binding, as the captain deliberately performed it outside the three-mile limit.

Genevieve M. Knight

Genevieve Madeline Knight (June 18, 1939 – August 19, 2021) was an American mathematics educator.
Education and career.
Knight was the youngest of three sisters who all became mathematics and science educators, daughters of a seamstress and a civil service radar specialist. As a freshman at Fort Valley State College in 1957, Knight was studying home economics when the Sputnik launch created a big push for more American students to become educated in mathematics and the sciences. Knight transferred to mathematics, "because it had fewer labs than any of the sciences", and graduated in 1961.
She completed a master's degree in 1963 at Atlanta University, under the supervision of Abdulalim A. Shabazz,
and took a teaching position at the Hampton Institute, also becoming an NSF fellow, a position that allowed her to travel and meet with other college mathematics teachers. In 1966, she returned to graduate school, and completed a doctorate in mathematics education in 1970 at the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Henry H. Walbesser.
Returning from her doctorate, Knight remained at the Hampton Institute, where she became chair of mathematics and computer science. In 1985 she moved to Coppin State College as a full professor. She retired in 2006.
Recognition.
In 1980, the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics named Knight as their College Teacher of the Year.
In 1993 she was named Maryland Mathematics Teacher of the Year, and the Mathematical Association of America gave Knight a Distinguished Teaching Award.
In 1996 the University System of Maryland named her as that year's Wilson H. Elkins Distinguished Professor.
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics gave her their 1999 lifetime achievement award for her service to mathematics education, outspoken support of equity "regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic background", and distinguished teaching. She was the 2013 Cox–Talbot Lecturer of the National Association of Mathematicians, one of the member societies of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences.
In 2018 the Association for Women in Mathematics named her as one of their inaugural Fellows.

Bohunician

Bohunician industry was a paleolithic archeological industry in South-Central and East Europe. The artifacts assigned to this culture are dated between roughly 48,000 and 40,000 years ago. 
They were found at the type site of Brno-Bohunice, Stránská skála (Moravia), Bacho Kiro and Temnata Cave (Bulgaria), Dzierzyslaw (Poland), and others.
The Bohunician is "transitional" between the Mousterian and the Aurignacian, and thus a candidate for representing the first wave of anatomically modern humans in Europe. Its technology resembles the Mousterian Levallois technique, as do the contemporary assemblages of the Szeletian (centered on the Bükk Mountains of Hungary but also present in southern Poland) and the Uluzzian (Italy).
Bohunician assemblages are considered similar to Emiran and Ahmarian ones and Bohunician culture may be linked to them.
For this reason, it is thought likely that the Bohunician indicates the presence of anatomically modern humans, but this has not been corrobated by the discovery of any associated human remains.

Daihonzan Chozen-ji

Daihonzan Chozen-ji (大本山超禅寺) is a Rinzai Zen temple located in Kalihi Valley on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It was established in 1972 by Omori Sogen and Tenshin Tanouye.
History.
In 1970 Omori Sogen and Tenshin Tanouye met in Japan. Tanouye, a music teacher at Farrington High School, trained with Sogen in Japan during summer vacations. Together they established the framework for Chozen-ji and its unique perspective on Zen, combining meditation, martial arts, and fine art.
In 1976 Chozen-ji moved to its current location in the back of Kalihi Valley.
In 1979 Omori Sogen established Chozen-ji as a Daihonzan, the main temple and headquarters of a new line of Zen. This made Chozen-ji the "first Rinzai headquarters temple established outside of Japan."
The temple has been popular among Hawaii's business and political elites, as well as welcoming people from all walks of life and religious affiliations.
Training approach.
Spiritual training at Chozen-ji is integrated with the practice of martial and fine arts, such as archery, ceramics and kendo. It is highly physical, with an emphasis on breath and posture.
Chozen-ji was established as a place to bring shugyō (the deepest possible spiritual training) to the West and cultivate kiai, or vibration, in every aspect of life.
Abbot.
The founding abbot was Tenshin Tanouye. The current abbot is Daian Sayama.
Activities.
Chozen-ji hosts daily zazen and holds regular fine arts and martial arts classes.

Kelly Davis (reporter)

Kelly Lynn Davis is a journalist and investigative reporter from San Diego, California.
Career.
Davis helped launch "San Diego CityBeat" in 2002 with David Rolland and was one of the main editors.
In March 2015, Davis left Southland Publishing, Inc, the publisher of "San Diego CityBeat". After leaving "CityBeat", Davis became a freelance writer. In May 2020, Davis joined The Appeal as a senior editor.
Davis has covered California laws about sex offenders, and has investigated San Diego's homeless situation.
Inmate deaths.
Davis and Dave Maass released a 5-part investigative series starting in 2013 in "San Diego CityBeat" about inmates dying in San Diego jails at the highest rates in the state, many of which were preventable deaths. This series won investigative awards and resulted in new policies and training to reduce suicides. In 2014, after the series had received widespread media attention, an inmate hanged himself while imprisoned and his widow sued San Diego county for negligence. In 2017, San Diego county claimed they didn't know about any problems with inmate deaths despite the widespread media coverage, and demanded that Davis provide her private investigative "notes, interviews and recordings" to help in San Diego's case against the widow. Davis refused. Many media outlets decried the request as inappropriate and a judge ordered a stay. It's been insinuated that San Diego county is trying to target or punish Davis for bringing negative media attention regarding the inmate deaths.
California right-to-die law.
Davis received national attention in 2016 for an essay she wrote about her sister Betsy, who suffered from late-stage ALS and legally ended her life under California's right-to-die law.
Personal life.
Davis is a breast cancer survivor.

FS Class E.360

The FS Class E.360 were electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS), using three-phase alternating current, built for the operation of the Valtellina line. They were ordered by Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network) and were originally numbered RA 361–363. Italian railways were nationalized in 1905 and they then became FS E.361-363 They were leased to Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1906 and returned to Italy in 1907.
Overview.
The locomotives were built for the Valtellina Railway, a 106 km long line with many tunnels and curves. Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó electrified the line in the early 1900s using high voltage three-phase alternating current.
Lease to SBB.
The three locomotives were leased to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) between 1906 and 1907 for the purpose of operating in the Simplon tunnel. The testing of the Simplon line was carried out on 25 January 1906 by a train pulled by a steam locomotive. On the following 26 April, the first test with an electric locomotive was carried out. The choice of the three-phase system was made by Swiss railway technicians after the visits they made to the Italian lines of the Valtellina. The Swiss had no three-phase locomotives of their own at the time so they asked for, and obtained on hire from the newly constituted Italian State Railways, the three new locomotives E.361, 362 and 363. The locomotives gave excellent service on the Simplon line, hauling over 10 trains a day. The only problem was with the current collectors. The original Ganz collectors did not collect current reliably so they were replaced by Brown-Boveri collectors.
Return to Italy.
Locomotive E.363 returned to Valtellina in May 1907 and E.361 and E.362 respectively in October and November of the same year.

Joseph A. Jordan Jr.

Joseph A. Jordan Jr. (1924 - 14 June 1991) was an African American lawyer and civil rights activist. He worked as a lawyer and judge and was part of the lawsuit heard before the Supreme Court of the United States that ended poll taxes.
Biography.
Jordan was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. He went to the Booker T. Washington High School and went on to the Virginia Union University. In 1943, he went into the United States Army and fought overseas with the 846 Gas Company and the 67th Infantry during World War II. In September 1945, he was injured when his jeep slid off of the highway into a mine field. The accident caused him to become paralyzed from the waist down so Jordan used a wheelchair. Jordan went on to earn a degree in sociology. He earned his law degree from Brooklyn Law School. Later, he studied labor law at New York University.
In 1954, he set up a law practice in Norfolk. In 1955, when the state of Virginia planned to create a referendum to allow segregation, Jordan filed an injunction to block the vote. When Jordan and another civil rights activist, Evelyn Thomas Butts, were restrained from picketing a supermarket for not hiring black people in high level jobs, Jordan fought the restraining order, but lost. Jordan was involved in several anti-segregation cases in 1961, 1962 and 1964 in Virginia. In November 1963, Butts hired him to sue the state for requiring a poll tax to vote. The case was dismissed by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1964. In May 1964, Jordan and Butts filed another suit which accused the state of violating four amendments of the Constitution with the poll tax. Butts' case against the poll tax was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and was bundled with another case, "Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections" in 1966"."
When the case went before the Supreme Court, Jordan argued that the poll tax laws had successfully barred black people not only from voting, but from holding office. Jordan said, "Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws, not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia." The decision was made by the Supreme Court in two months and they decided that the poll tax or voting fee did violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
In 1968, Jordan was elected to the Norfolk City Council and became the first black person to hold the seat since 1889. In 1971, Jordan was the only black member of the city council. In 1972, he became the vice-mayor of Norfolk. In 1974, Jordan resigned as vice-mayor in protest, "saying the city is being run by the Norfolk Redevelopment Authority rather than City Council."
Jordan was appointed to the General District Court on July 1, 1977. He was one of only a few African American state judges at the time. He retired from this position in 1986.
Jordan died at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Hampton on June 14, 1991. A public library in Norfolk is named after Jordan. A foundation in his name, the Joe Jordan Foundation, raised funds in his name to build the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Norfolk. The memorial was dedicated in 2000 and had been proposed in the 1970s by Jordan.

Betty Jo Geiger

Betty Jo Geiger (née Springs; born June 12, 1961) is an American female former long-distance runner who competed in events ranging from 3000-meter run to the marathon.
Her greatest individual success was at the inaugural IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships in 1983, where she was runner-up to Britain's Wendy Sly and led the Americans to the team gold medal. Geiger was a key member of the national team at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in the 1980s. Her first team medal – a silver – came at the 1981 championships and following that she helped the United States to three consecutive team titles in 1983, 1984 and 1985. She finished in the top ten on each occasion, being the number one American in 1983 and number two American athlete to Jan Merrill, Joan Benoit and Cathy Branta in the other years. She made one more appearance at the competition in 1986, and also represented her country at the Goodwill Games that year.
She was a four-time national champion, having won the 5000-meter run at the 1986 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships (in a championship record time), the national 10K run three times (1984, 1985, and 1986) and the individual title at the USA Cross Country Championships. She attended North Carolina State University and won four NCAA Championships for the NC State Wolfpack team: a 5000/10,000 m double at the 1983 NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships and victories at the NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship in 1981 and 1983. She won the Broderick Award (now the Honda Sports Award) as the nation's best female collegiate cross country runner in 1984. She was inducted into the NC State Hall of Fame in 2013.
Geiger competed extensively at professional road races and had wins at the Peachtree Road Race, Freihofer's Run for Women (three times), and Gate River Run, as well as runner-up finishes at the Falmouth Road Race and Gasparilla Distance Classic. She married her former college coach Rollie Geiger. In her youth she won the national junior title over 3000 m and was undefeated in Florida high school competitions, with 15 state titles for Bayshore High School in her native Bradenton.

Obsession is the fourth album by American jazz trumpeter Wallace Roney which was recorded in 1990 and released on the Muse label early the following year.
Reception.
The AllMusic review by Ken Dryden stated, "In the early days of his career, trumpeter Wallace Roney was tagged as being yet another Miles Davis-influenced player, though a focused hearing of his fourth CD as a leader will demonstrate how much he was developing his own voice on this exciting hard bop session ... An enjoyable early effort".

Cevian Capital

Cevian Capital is a Swedish investment firm founded in 1996 by Christer Gardell and Lars Förberg, both of whom serve as managing partners. Backed by Carl Icahn, it is the largest activist investment firm in Europe. It has offices in Stockholm, Zurich, and London.
Formerly called Amaranth, Cevian has invested in such companies as ABB, Danske Bank, ThyssenKrupp, Volvo , G4S, TeliaSonera, and Lindex, and played a major role in the sale of Skandia to Old Mutual.
Founding.
Christer Gardell is co-founder and managing partner. Born in 1960, he graduated in business from the Stockholm School of Economics in 1984. After working as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company, he was CEO of AB Custos from 1996 to 2001.
Also holding the title co-founder and managing partner is Lars Förberg. Förberg also graduated from the Stockholm School of Economics. He worked with Gardell at AB Custos from 1997 to 2001 as Chief Investment Officer. Förberg is based in Zurich.
Investment activity.
As of June 2016, Cevian had $13 billion in assets under management. As of September 2017, it had about $15.5 billion in AUM.
In 2006, Cevian launched Cevian Capital II, the largest dedicated active ownership fund in Europe.
The firm invests only in Europe, although 70% of its capital comes from North America. It does not short stocks, use leverage, write open letters, or engage in proxy fights, and it believes in long-term investments. At first its investments were confined to Scandinavia; more recently, according to Zimmerman, the firm's investment focus has been "on the Nordics, UK, Germany and Switzerland," because these countries "have a combination of clearest governance rules in favor of shareholders, good transparency as well as interesting companies." Cevian has not invested in southern or central Europe, Zimmerman has said, "because we don't know those environments and we don't have relationships there, and we can't be certain that the rules, formal and informal rules, are ones that we'll be comfortable with." Gardell has also stated that he and his colleagues need "to know the people, have networks, have a corporate governance tradition we're comfortable with" in order to make an investment.
In 2012, at Cevian's urging, Cookson, a British engineering firm, spun off its performance materials division, increasing investment value for Cookson shareholders by over 25%.
On December 16, 2018, ABB relented to pressure from Cevian and agreed to sell its poorly-performing Power Grids unit.

Jesu Oyingbo

Emmanuel Odumosu known predominantly by his sobriquet Jesu Oyingbo which means "“Jesus of Oyingbo”" was a religious sect leader who claimed he was Jesus Christ returned. He founded the Universal College of Regeneration in Lagos. A self-proclaimed messiah, his personal beliefs included liberal sexual rights and capital accumulation. Sect members worked in various businesses of the movement establishing a self-contained economy within the movement.
Life.
Odumosu was born in 1915 to Jacob Odumosu, his grandfather was Joseph Odumosu, a famous traditional healer in Ijebu Ode. Trained as a carpenter, he served with the Post and Telegraph Department during World War II. An active member in the postal workers union, a general strike in 1945 led to his disengagement from the department. He took on carpentry work and opened a shop on Lagos Island close to Oil Mill Street. However, he struggled as a carpenter and was constantly in debt, he was jailed for six months on charges brought by his creditors. During this period, Odumosu attended various Protestant churches in Lagos, but soon claimed he received visions and dreams from God. He interpreted some of the visions as messianic visions and that he was chosen as a messiah that has come to redeem the world. He began his rebirth by holding evening meetings close to his shop.
Universal College of Regeneration.
Odumosu's early sermons emphasized duality of the world and self-discipline. The natural world which is filled with evil machinations, principalities and powers and a spiritual world, in which he had access. The spiritual world and natural world are in constant battle, with the former emphasized as the redeemer of the natural world. His religious movement started in 1952 at a location in Lagos Island, another major message was self-disciple; consisting of denouncing alcohol, women and tobacco. At onset, initial congregation was small, about 30 members could be counted in 1954. During this time, he instituted tithe giving to assist the poor, Odumosu also encouraged members to fund his evangelical missions. His movement began to grow and better organized, the growth assisted with a donation by a wealthy convert who provided his property for Odumosu's use. One of those properties was in Ebute Metta, where Odumosu decided to settle the movement. Since the founding of the movement, members lived at their own residences, but after the movement to Ebute Metta, Odumosu asked them to leave their houses and live in rented properties close to the church building. Members declared their wealth to Odumosu who took 10% of the tithe and charged them rent. To expand his movement, he began preaching his sermon with loudspeakers placed outside in the church hall, at a location close to Oyingbo Market, where he was sometimes derisively called 'Jesu Oyingbo'. At the new location, he began to emphasize humility and obedience, to initiate new male members, he will whip them with nine strokes of cane. In 1959, he declared himself Jesus, reduced his sermons and began to initiate various business ventures to fund a New Jerusalem. Among the ventures were Jolly Makers and Happy Day food canteens, Deluxe bakeries makers of Goodluck bread, the properties housing this venture were then expanded to include barber shops and lodging. Economy wise, the various businesses provided wages to his followers. In 1960, a schism in the church led to the exodus of most of his members. But Odumosu who had changed from preaching self-discipline to loyalty did not seem to mind, because to continue his business ventures, he needed loyal workers who will serve him.
Odumosu's sexual practices were less conservative than other Christian denominations and he was said to have established sexual rights over many females within his sect.
Odumosu died in 1988.
