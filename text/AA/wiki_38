Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International

Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International (DTCI) was a business segment and division of The Walt Disney Company consisting of Disney's streaming services and overseas media businesses, formed in March 2018. As part of the segment's formation, Disney Streaming Services (formerly BAMTech) was placed under Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International.
In October 2020, the division was dissolved and its business segments were split into Disney International Operations and Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution after Disney initiated a reorganization of its various media and entertainment divisions.
Background.
In 1997, Disney and Sony Pictures formed a film distribution joint venture in Southeast Asia which covered five countries.
From 1999 to 2000, Bob Iger was president of Walt Disney International and chairman of ABC TV Group. until he was promoted to president and chief operating officer of the Walt Disney Company.
Andy Bird became the next president of Walt Disney International in 2004. At the time of Bird's appointment, most countries' units except in Latin America operated independently. He took the Latin America-integrated operation as a guide for other regions. Strategically, Bird wanted their companies to be the Walt Disney Company of India and other countries, not the Walt Disney Company of a certain country, basically tailoring the company to the country with, for example, localization of programming. Diego Lerner, who led Disney Latin America, was thus named President of Disney Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa in 2009.
Buena Vista International and Sony Pictures Releasing International formed fourteen distribution joint ventures, including in Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines. Another Buena Vista-Sony distribution joint venture was set up in Russia in December 2006.
The Walt Disney Company's CIS office in Russia opened in 2006. The company's original plan was for to release three films per year. In 2009, Disney CIS released its first Russian language-film, "The Book of Masters" which took in 10.8 million on a budget of $8 million. By April 2011, the company announced that director Vladimir Grammatikov was hired by the company as creative producer, while two more Russian films were placed into production: A fairy tale and a youth story. Instead, the country's unit took a seven-year hiatus until they announced the production on "The Last Knight" in April 2016. On November 26, 2017, the film became the highest-grossing local-language release of all time in Russia, with a gross of 1.68 billion rubles ($28.8 million).
In 2014, Walt Disney International appointed Luke Kang to head its Greater China unit. Disney's South East Asia managing director Rob Gilby appointed three managers for Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand, who were Herry Salim, Veronica Espinosa-Cabalinan, and Subha-Orn Rathanamongkolmas (Soupy) respectively, in May 2017.
Paul Candland was promoted from president of Walt Disney Japan to president of The Walt Disney Company Asia, consisting of Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and Greater China in July 2014. Stanley Cheung was also promoted from managing director to chairman of TWDC Greater China. Both reported to Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International.
With the retirement of the Asia unit's head Paul Candland after 19 years in September 2017, Disney split the Asia unit into two: North Asia and South Asia. North Asia consists of Japan, South Korea and Greater China and is headed by Kang, while South Asia combined India and South East Asia. The India unit's head Mahesh Samat would assume leadership of the South Asia unit by October 1, and the South East Asia unit's head Gilby left the company. Later in September, Lerner was transferred to a new position within Walt Disney International, with Rebecca Campbell, the then-president of ABC Daytime and ABC Owned Television Stations, named to replace him as president of Disney EMEA. In February 2017, Sony Pictures withdrew from the Philippines-distribution joint venture, followed by a withdrawing in August 2017 from the remainder of the Southeast Asian distribution joint venture with Disney.
In November 2015, Disney UK started Disney's test streaming service, DisneyLife, with Disney films, TV series, books and music tracks, under general manager Paul Brown. The original plan had the service spreading to other countries in Europe, including France, Spain, Italy and Germany in 2016. In October 2017, the Republic of Ireland was the second country where DisneyLife was made available. DisneyLife was launched in China in December 2017 through a partnership between Disney and Alibaba Digital Entertainment, only to have the Chinese government shut it down in August 2018 because of foreign content rules. Instead, in February 2018, Disney and Alibaba reached a new deal that placed Disney content on Alibaba's Youku streaming platform. On May 25, 2018, DisneyLife was expanded to the Philippines, making it the third country where the service was available. In 2019, following the announcement of the UK Disney+ release date, Disney revealed that existing service DisneyLife would be folded into Disney+.
In August 2016, The Walt Disney Company acquired a 1/3 stake in BAMTech for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the said company the future. On August 8, 2017, Disney announced that it would increase its ownership in the company to a 75% controlling stake for $1.58 billion. Disney also reiterated its plan to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service in early-2018, followed by a Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019.

Certain other Fox executives left the company in the reorganization, including head of international distribution Andrew Cripps, and Zubin Gandevia, head of Fox Networks Group in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. Disney's Malaysia and Singapore head Amit Malhotra would lead emerging markets and South Asia Pacific content sales, reporting to Shankar. Chafic Najia, a Disney senior vice president, was promoted to the Middle East'x media cluster manager. Disney's Australia and New Zealand manager Kylie Watson-Wheeler added media networks and direct-to-consumer to her responsibilities.
In July 2019, Marinelli announced her resignation, ending a 34-year long tenure with the company. Disney announced it would combine all the company's media sales and channel distribution into one organization. ESPN's executive vice president Justin Connolly was promoted to the newly created role of president of media distribution, reporting to Mayer.
On January 31, 2020 it was announced that Hulu CEO Randy Freer would be stepping down, as the position of CEO was removed, with all Hulu executives now reporting directly to corresponding DTCI business heads. Hulu's original programming team would continue reporting to chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment and FX on Hulu to the FX chairman.
On March 12, 2020, Vanessa Morrison, who previously served as President of Fox Family and Fox Animation, was appointed President of Streaming for Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production and will oversee development and production of Disney+ film content from The Walt Disney Studios for both Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios. Morrison answers directly to head of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production Sean Bailey.
On May 18, 2020, Mayer stepped down as DTCI chairman to become the CEO of TikTok. He was succeeded by Rebecca Campbell, who was previously the president of Disneyland Resort. This was soon followed by the transfer of the sales division (ad and distribution) to Disney Media Networks.
On August 4, 2020, Disney announced that it would launch a Star-branded streaming service in 2021. This will be a general entertainment service, featuring content from ABC Signature, 20th Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures. The streaming service will be integrated with Disney+ in most countries.
On October 12, 2020, it was announced that Disney would be restructuring its media and entertainment businesses, effective immediately, which resulted in the dissolution of Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International and two business segments being created in its place: Disney International Operations, responsible for managing the international operations of The Walt Disney Company; and Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, responsible for handling the company's streaming services, advertisting operations, and its linear and syndicated television networks.

.dev

.dev is a top-level domain name operated by Google. It was proposed in ICANN's new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program, and became available to the general public on March 1, 2019, with an early access period that began on February 19. To increase the security of the domains, the entire gTLD has been included in the HSTS preload-list; as a result, popular web browsers will only connect to a .dev webpage using HTTPS.
Security.
The .dev top-level domain is incorporated on the HSTS preload list, requiring HTTPS on all .dev domains without individual HSTS enlistment.
History.
Web developers have been using .dev top-level domains within their internal networks for testing purposes for a long time. However, after Google acquired the TLD, such environments have stopped functioning on some modern web browsers.

1983 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy elected its ninth delegation to the Italian Senate on June 26, 1983. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1983 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Six Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua, and this time the industrial Province of Milan, preferred the Italian Communist Party.
Background.
As the red rising seemed to be stopped in Italy, many center-right electors began to think no more necessary a vote for Christian Democracy which lost many seats to minor parties, especially to the Italian Republican Party of former Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

Operational history of the Sukhoi Su-25

1980–1990.
Soviet–Afghan War.
In total, the Sukhoi Su-25 amassed a total of 60,000 sorties throughout its service in Afghanistan until the Soviet withdrawal in February 1989. The first combat Su-25 unit to be formed was the 200th Independent Attack Squadron (OShAE) based out of Sital-Chai in Soviet Azerbaijan. The first aircraft from the unit arrived in Afghanistan in May 1980 with the full unit deploying in June to Shindand airfield in the western part of the country. The deployment was called Operation "Exam" and involved a team of engineers and technicians who would oversee the aircraft and evaluate its performance. The first Su-25 combat missions began on 25 July with the 200th OShAE flying counterinsurgency sorties and close air support in support of the 5th Motorized Rifle Division. By 1982, the Su-25's area of responsibility expanded and the aircraft began flying missions sometimes as far as Kabul with pilots flying on average 4–5, sometimes as many as 8, sorties a day. The aircraft typically flew with external fuel tanks to increase its range but was barred from flying in poor weather conditions or nighttime due to faulty navigational equipment. By the time the squadron left Afghanistan in October 1982, its Su-25s had logged more than 2,000 sorties with no losses, however some had sustained damage due to ground fire. The deployment allowed engineers to make several modifications to the aircraft's weapons systems, replacing them with ones more suited for mountain operations and installing increased countermeasures and defensive systems.
The introduction of the Su-25 in Afghanistan led to a vastly expanded scope of operations by Soviet ground commanders who could now insert their troops deeper into guerrilla territory with better air cover. The Mujahideen grew to fear and respect the Su-25 as the war grew on, adapting their tactics around the assumption of its use. Su-25s were used as development platforms for Soviet precision guided munitions, being some of the first Soviet aircraft to use such munitions in combat, typically against cave entrances or weapons storage sites. In April 1986, the Su-25 used a precision-guided weapon in combat for the first time, firing a Kh-25 and Kh-29 missile against enemy targets. The introduction of precision bombs and missiles allowed the Su-25 to begin flying missions at higher-altitude, reducing the risk posed by anti-aircraft artillery and shoulder launched surface-to-air missiles.
Due to the fact Su-25s were often tasked with flying low-altitude, subsonic, close air support missions in support of ground forces in combat, they made frequent targets for Mujahideen anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles. Some 23 aircraft were shot down over the course of the war, with an additional dozen or so were lost in non-combat related incidents, while another dozen were written off due to extensive damage, and a further nine were destroyed by bombardments on the ground in Kabul and Kandahar. In all, Su-25s represented a quarter of Soviet Air Force (VVS) fixed-wing losses in the campaign.
On 16 January 1984, a Su-25 piloted by a Soviet lieutenant colonel was struck by a 9K32 Strela-2 missile and downed near Urgun, Afghanistan, making it the first shootdown of a Su-25 in the war.
In August 1988, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Alexander Rutskoy was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed. Rutskoy ejected but landed on Pakistani soil where he was captured and later repatriated to the Soviets. Some sources state he was shot down by Pakistani warplanes. The aircraft's wreckage was reportedly salvaged by Pakistan and handed over to the United States. In October of that year, a Su-25 sustained a powerful hit at high-altitude north of Gardez, heavily damaging it but remaining flyable. The strike was reportedly the result of a missile fired by a Pakistani fighter jet.
In January 1989, a missile hit a Su-25 near Kabul killing the pilot in the last combat loss of the aircraft in Afghanistan.
Iran–Iraq War.
The Iraqi Air Force was the first non-Eastern Bloc country to receive the Su-25, with Iraq receiving 69 'K' single-seat variants and four 'UBK' two-seater variants between 1986 and 1987, enough to equip two ground-attack regiments. The Su-25 saw extensive use in the latter stages of the Iran–Iraq War, its first action outside of Afghanistan, in combat against Iranian forces. One Su-25K purportedly survived a direct hit from an Iranian MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile battery, managing to return to base and land. In total, the Su-25 took part in 900 combat sorties in the conflict and many of their pilots were personally decorated by Saddam Hussein. Two Su-25Ks were lost in combat in the war, of which one was lost to Iranian air defenses.
1990–2000.
Persian Gulf War.
The Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 aircraft played little part in the Persian Gulf War as did most Iraqi aircraft. At least one Su-25 squadron saw action during the August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait. During the war, seven of the IAF's Su-25 aircraft were flown to neighboring Iran to shield them from air strikes. Two Su-25 jets were shot down by U.S. F-15C interceptors on 6 February 1991 using AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. However, most of Iraq's Su-25 fleet was destroyed on the ground in precision strikes on hardened aircraft shelters during the war and they were not used for ground attack against coalition forces.
Angolan Civil War.
Angola received its first batch of Su-25 jets from the Soviet Union in 1988. During the Angolan Civil War, the Angolan Air Force used the Su-25 against UNITA forces advancing on Luanda but to little tactical effect as they often flew bombing missions from high altitudes, reducing the aircraft's effectiveness, an issue exacerbated by a withdrawal of Soviet support in 1991 which caused serviceability issues. The Su-25 was also flown by mercenaries from the South African private military company Executive Outcomes based out of Saurimo Airport against UNITA forces beginning in the early 1990s.
War in Abkhazia.
During the War in Abkhazia, the Su-25 was used by the Georgian Air Force, the Abkhazian Air Force, and the Russian Air Force in a series of combat actions in the breakaway province. The Georgian Air Force flew as many as 215 combat missions in the Su-25 during the war. Russian Su-25s flying on the side of Abkhazian separatists performed numerous raids on Georgian positions near the besieged port city of Sukhumi, flying out of an airfield in Gudauta. On at least one occasion, a Russian Su-25 bombed a residential district of Sukhumi, killing a civilian and destroying numerous homes and other buildings. During the conflict, the Russian government asserted that Su-25s bombing Georgian positions were not Russian but, in fact, Georgian warplanes with painted Russian insignia, a claim that drew much doubt since many of these Su-25 aircraft were flying uninhibited through Russian airspace. On 6 January 1993, a Georgian Su-25 crashed in Abkhazia province with the pilot ejecting to safety. On 19 March 1993, a Russian Air Force Su-25 piloted by Major Vazlav Shipko was shot down by Georgian air defenses near Sukhumi, however some sources state he was flying a Su-27. On 4 July 1993, a Georgian Su-25 was struck by an Abkhazian surface-to-air missile, forcing the aircraft into the sea off Sukhumi and killing the pilot.
Eritrean–Ethiopian War.
The Ethiopian Air Force operated the Su-25 during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, after receiving a delivery of a pair of Su-25Ts and two Su-25UBKs from the Russian Air Force in March 2000. Combat operations were flown from Mek'ele and Debre Zeyit. On 15 May 2000, a Su-25 piloted by Flight Lieutenant Wondu Ghenda was shot down by an Eritrean Air Force MiG-29, killing the pilot.
First Nagorno-Karabak War.
During the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, both Armenia and Azerbaijan used Su-25 aircraft inherited from the Soviet Union. However, Armenia's use of its modest five jets during the war was minimal while the Azeri Air Force utilized it heavily in strafing and bombing missions against Armenian targets. At least three Su-25s operated by Azerbaijan were downed during the conflict. One was shot down in 1992 by a missile while conducting a ground attack mission over Armenian territory. In 1994, two were lost in separate incidents. One in February where the aircraft was struck by ground fire causing the pilot to eject and become captured. Another Su-25 was lost the following April with the pilot managing to eject. Human Rights Watch alleges in a 1994 report that Azerbaijan used its Su-25 aircraft in an indiscriminate manner against civilian population centers in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.
Chechen War.
Su-25s saw heavy use by the Russian Air Force again during the First and Second Chechen War. During the First Chechen War, some 140 Su-25s flew 5,300 strike sorties, notably playing an instrumental role in the destruction and the capture of the heavily defended Grozny Presidential Palace, dropping BETAB-500 anti-concrete bombs on it. However, Russian Su-25s rarely operated at night or in poor weather due to faulty equipment and insufficient training, and aircraft rarely used precision munitions, utilizing unguided bombs and rockets for the most part instead. This lack of precision munitions and poor training led to several friendly fire incidents where Russian aircraft hit buildings occupied by Russian troops. However, Russian air losses during the campaign were low due to a lack of capable air defenses. Four Su-25s were lost in combat.
During the initial push into Chechnya, Russian Su-25 and Su-24 strike aircraft destroyed the majority of the dilapidated Chechen air fleet on the ground in a matter of hours. In 1995, facilitated by clear weather, air cover provided by Su-25s allowed Russian troops to push across the Argun River and into the towns of Gudermes and Shali, setting the stage for a decisive victory over separatist forces in the region.
Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed on 21 April 1996, after a Su-25 fired two laser-guided missiles at his position, after an A-50 aircraft pinpointed his satellite phone signal and relayed the location to the Su-25. A picture purportedly from the warhead as it approached Dudayev later surfaced in "Argumenty i Fakty", a Russian newspaper.
In 1999, Russian Su-25s once again saw heavy use in Chechnya with the onset of the Second Chechen War in 1999. During the war, the Su-25 was again primarily a close air support platform, providing support for ground troops at low altitude in conjunction with Mi-24 Hind and Ka-50 helicopters while Su-24s flew higher altitude precision strikes. Su-25s would often fly at altitudes between 16,000 and 20,000 feet before visually acquiring and attacking their targets at lower altitudes, typically utilizing unguided rockets and bombs. For more accurate strikes, Su-25s used Kh-25ML and Kh-29 laser-guided missiles. In a newer tactic not utilized during the First Chechen War, Su-25s engaged in "free hunt" operations, flying ahead of larger Russian formations in visual search of targets of opportunity. On occasion, these flights would be accompanied by reconnaissance Su-24s to increase the probability of locating mobile targets.
A new all-weather with night capability variant, the Su-25T, was introduced into combat during this conflict with notable successes with six of the aircraft flying a total of 20 sorties throughout the fighting. The 'T' model had improved sighting and was modified to include the new B-13 rocket pod.
Six Su-25 aircraft were lost during the Second Chechen War.
2000–2010.
Macedonian insurgency.
In June 2001, the government of Macedonia procured four Su-25 aircraft (three single seat, one two-seater) from Ukraine which promptly entered service in the Macedonian Air Force. In the first aerial combat action of the Macedonian military, they were used to combat ethnic Albanian insurgents in Macedonia. Mostly flown from an air force base near Petrovec, these aircraft were piloted by Ukrainian mercenaries as Macedonia did not have any pilots trained in flying the aircraft. They saw heavy use in ground attack missions against insurgents. During the Battle of Raduša in August 2001, the Su-25s supported beleaguered security forces in the town alongside Mi-24 helicopters.
Ivorian Civil War.
Four Su-25 aircraft (two one seaters, and two two-seaters) were procured from Belarus by the Ivory Coast in 2004. After the outbreak of the First Ivorian Civil War, the government of Laurent Gbagbo used his air force to bomb rebel forces. On 6 November 2004, a pair of Su-25 aircraft based out of Abidjan and piloted by mixed crews of Ivorians and Belorussians bombed a French encampment near the city of Bouaké, killing nine French Licorne peacekeepers and an American aid worker, and destroying several vehicles. The attack triggered the French to destroy the Ivorian air force, firing MILAN missiles at the two Su-25s that had attacked the French troops shortly after they landed, damaging them, and seizing the other two and disabling them.
Sudan and Chad.
The Sudanese Air Force has obtained fifteen Su-25 aircraft from Belarus since 2008. Despite Sudanese government assurances that the aircraft would not be used in the Darfur conflict, United Nations inspectors discovered four Su-25 bombers at El Fasher Airport in the region and numerous reports have surfaced of the aircraft taking part in indiscriminate targeting of villages.
Chad obtained six Su-25 jets from Ukraine to enhance its close air support capability. In May 2009, the Su-25s operated by the Chadian Air Force bombed rebel columns in southeastern Chad, near Abéché.
Russo-Georgia War.
The Su-25 was once again pressed into service in the skies of Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, seeing extensive use by both the Russian and Georgian air forces. At the beginning of the war, Georgia had a fleet of twelve Su-25 aircraft (two of them trainers) at its disposal. The aircraft saw particularly heavy use in fighting around Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital. Out of six Russian aircraft lost in the war, three were Su-25s. All were most likely lost to friendly fire.
The first Russian air loss of the campaign was a Su-25 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Terebunsky of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, shot down over the territory of South Ossetia near the Zarsk pass, between Dzhava and Tskhinvali. He was hit by a MANPADS missile fired by South Ossetian militia around 6.00 p.m. on 8 August, in a case of friendly fire. Earlier in the day, a flight of four Georgian Su-25 planes had attacked a Russian army convoy in the same area. This was one of the few missions conducted by Georgia's Su-25s during the brief conflict as Tblisi reasoned that its aircraft would soon become easy targets for Russian interceptors. The aircraft returned to their bases and were hidden under camouflage netting to prevent them from being located.
At 10:30 a.m. on 9 August, a Su-25 piloted by Colonel Sergey Kobylash, commander of the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, was shot down during an attack on a Georgian military formation south of Tskhinvali, on the Gori-Tskhinvali road. After making his initial approach, Kolybash's aircraft was struck by a missile that impacted his left engine, rendering it inoperable. Not long after, as Kobylash was returning to base at an altitude of 1,000 meters, a MANPADS missile struck his right engine, leaving the plane without thrust. Kobylash ejected north of Tskhinvali in a South Ossetian village of the Georgian enclave of in the Great Liakh gorge, where he was recovered by a Russian combat search and rescue team. Shortly after Kobylash was rescued, South Ossetian militants made the claim they had downed a Georgian Su-25 however this possibility was rejected as Georgia's air force had ceased air operations the day before, more than likely making the shootdown of the Su-25 another incident of friendly fire.
At 1:00 p.m. on 9 August, another Su-25 from the 368th Attack Aviation Regiment, piloted by Major Vladimir Edamenko, was struck by fire from a Russian ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun near Dzhava killing the pilot. Two hours later, a Su-25 mistakenly attacked a Russian military convoy near Liakhva, destroying a fuel tanker and injuring several troops. The Russian soldiers returned fire with a MANPADS damaging the Su-25.
Russian Su-25s also hit numerous targets deep inside Georgian territory including the Marneuli air base, however none of Georgia's Su-25 aircraft were lost. In Tskhinvali, Russian Su-25s attacked Georgian infantrymen as they rested in the outskirts of the city. The strikes killed 20 Georgian troops and injured countless more, causing the entire battalion to abandon their equipment and flee sparking rumors about the battalion's annihilation which played a hand in the Georgian withdrawal from the city. The Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing, a factory that produces Su-25s, was also bombed damaging a runway but otherwise causing no casualties.
2010–present.
Syrian Civil War.
In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense released satellite photos of an airfield in Latakia, a Syrian government-controlled city, showing twelve Su-25 planes on the tarmac. Airstrikes by Russian forces in support of the Assad government began later that same month. The aircraft have been used predominantly to strike opposition vehicles, fighting positions, artillery pieces, and other non-strategic targets in the country.
In January 2015, Syrian Air Force MiG-29s and Russian Su-25s took part in a joint-strike mission against militant targets in what was the first time Syrian and Russian warplanes flew a combat mission together.
In 2016, Alexander Galkin, the Russia's Southern Military District commander, said Su-25s had flown more than 1,600 sorties and dropped around 6,000 bombs since the beginning of Russia's intervention in September 2015. In September 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a video showing two Su-25s helping to rescue Russian troops encircled by Tahrir al-Sham militants. Two months later, a pair of Su-25s flying near Mayadin, in eastern Syria, was suddenly intercepted by a U.S. F-22 jet which abruptly entered the flight path of the two Russian warplanes and deployed flares and chaff in an attempt to cause the Su-25s to change their heading. The United States claimed the incident was not a provocation but a response to the Russian jets crossing the Euphrates River deconfliction line and not responding to radio calls.
On 3 February 2018, a Russian Su-25 piloted by Major Roman Filipov flying over Idlib Governorate was hit by a surface-to-air missile, downing the aircraft and forcing the pilot to eject. Filipov committed suicide to avoid capture on the ground.
Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian Air Force has made use of its fleet of Su-25 warplanes in the War in Donbass, using them for strike missions against pro-Russian separatists, and at times Russian government forces. During the First Battle of Donetsk Airport, Su-25s were witnessed partaking in ground attack missions, at times firing unguided rockets at separatist positions. During fighting at Kramatorsk Airport, Su-25s were used to deliver supplies to besieged Ukrainian troops, flying at a low altitude and parachuting provisions. A rocket and strafing attack on a regional administration building in Luhansk was purportedly carried out by a Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft. During the Battle of Debaltseve in 2015, Russian Air Force Su-25s participated in the route of Ukrainian troops and the subsequent capture of the city. After the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, the Russian military cited the appearance of a Ukrainian Su-25 on its radar in the vicinity of the airliner as evidence that the Ukrainian military were the culprits behind the shootdown.
Four Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft have been lost in combat during the conflict. On 16 July 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 was struck by a missile and downed over eastern Ukraine. The pilot was able to eject and survived. The Ukrainian government placed the blame for the shootdown on a Russian Su-27 fighter jet.
On 23 July 2014, a pair of Su-25 jets flying near separatist-held Savur-Mohyla were shot down while flying at an altitude of 17,000 feet (5,200 meters). Both pilots were able to eject. The Ukrainian military said the aircraft had been downed by a long-range missile system, possibly fired from Russia.
On 29 August 2014, a Su-25 flying near Luhansk was shot down by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot ejected and was recovered by Ukrainian troops.
Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017).
In late June 2014, twelve Su-25 planes arrived in Iraq aboard cargo planes after being purchased second-hand from Russia, entering combat service shortly later in the war against the Islamic State, despite having few munitions in its stockpile compatible with the type. The delivery was accompanied by technicians in order to train the Iraqis in the plane's operation and maintenance. The purchase was made after several delays complicated Baghdad's purchase of U.S. F-16 fighters. Seven more Su-25s from Iran arrived in Iraq before the end of June as well. These aircraft were formerly Iraqi Air Force jets that had fled to Iran during the 1990–1991 Gulf War. Experts noted that some of the aircraft has visible signs of wear and corrosion. In 2015, Iraqi pilots received training in Belarus on flying the Su-25. By 2016, Iraq had 21 Su-25s in its possession.
Iraqi Air Force Su-25s were used for close air support during the Battle of Ramadi and other battles in western Al Anbar Governorate. On 12 August 2014, a Su-25 piloted by Iraqi Colonel Jalil Al Awadi crashed after takeoff at Muthenna Air Base, severely damaging the plane and killing the pilot. Another Su-25 was withdrawn from service after suffering damage when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile during a mission over Kirkuk.

Trinity Court Building

Trinity Court Building is the name of several structures that have occupied the address 70, 74, and 76 Trinity Place, between Rector and Albany Streets, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City.
Third building.
Trinity Church, which owns the site, had its offices and preschool in the 1927 building. In 2015, the church faced a choice of a $33 million renovation to bring it up to code, or to replace it with a new building at a cost of about $35 million. The vestry decided on the latter and tore the structure down. In its place, it planned to construct a new building with an address of 68-74 Trinity Place.
Originally, of primarily luxury condominiums with a modern glass facade was planned. Due to community opposition the plans were changed, with a smaller commercial building incorporating community-friendly uses. The new design also uses bronzed aluminum to better fit in with the church and a preserved footbridge from the previous building, and incorporates stained glass and terra cotta embellishments salvaged form the 1927 edifice. The third building, known as "Trinity Commons", topped out in 2018 and will open in 2021.

Witchcraft (film series)

Witchcraft is a horror film series, that as of March 2018, has 16 direct to video installments, making it one of the horror genre's longest-running interconnected series. It began in 1988, and most films focus, at least partially, on the character of William Spanner, who is a powerful warlock who fights for good despite having an evil lineage.
Setting.
Mythology.
The series begins when Grace Churchill discovers her husband and mother-in-law's plan to use her newborn child, William, as a means to bring about the end of the world. The husband and mother-in-law are evil witches, who worship Satan. While Grace prevents this from happening, it is thought that only William and his mother survives the first film. In the second movie, 18 year old William, unaware of his heritage, and having been adopted by the Adams family, finds that his next door neighbor, the witch who survived from the first film, attempts to seduce him to use his powers for darkness. The Adams are white witches who had rejected the evil of the coven from the first film and stole William away.
Spanner resists the temptation, and in between the second and third movie, becomes a lawyer, getting a job in the district attorney's office. After being fired from the district attorney's office (a move which later movies reveal was caused by his black magic roots being discovered) he opens his own law office. Spanner resists his heritage, preferring a normal life, but events conspire to force him to use his powers, often with the fate of the world at stake. Spanner later becomes more comfortable with his powers and his role in protecting the world against the dark powers. Beginning in Witchcraft VI, Spanner often serves as an unofficial consultant for the Los Angeles Police Department, usually working with Detective Lutz and/or Garner.
While Spanner is the main character of the series, he is not in movies 8 and 10, and is only an infant in the first film. He dies at the end of the seventh movie, and remains dead during the eighth movie, but is resurrected in the ninth movie. He does not appear during the tenth movie, which is set in London, England and follows Lt. Lutz as she assist Interpol with a case, although he is referenced.
Keli is Spanner's Girlfriend in many of the movies, and they are engaged sometime between the tenth and the eleventh movie, but she disappears and is not referred to after the 11th movie.
The 14th–16th movies form a connected trilogy. The 16th film takes place in the "real" world, pokes fun of the film series recasting of the leads and the low budget nature of the series, using the actors from the 14th and 15th movie. The 16th movie explains that the entire series, and its oft recasting of the leads, is part of a careful plot by Satan to control the world.
Cast and crew.

List indicator(s)
Production.
Development.
All movies have been produced by Vista Street Entertainment. Troma Studios released films 1–9. The series maintains an official YouTube channel with behind the scenes information and a Facebook page.
Reception.
Despite its longevity, the series is not well regarded, and the AV Club notes that the series "Witchcraft continually relies on the same stock story lines, most often involving a good warlock struggling against trashy temptresses sent by evil warlocks to seduce him to the dark side." Crave's series project states the series is "trashy ... straight-to-video schlock " and finds little use for the series other than as "notorious video store staples". "The first four movies had the pretense of a supernatural plot and an interconnected mythology, but after that, the series began to slump (or improve, depending on your point of view) in to blatant softcore pornography.
In Creature Feature, a review of the first six movies found much of the same, with the third movie being the best of the first six.
TV Guide states "It's hard to fathom why this cheap-looking, uninspired series has run so long. Perhaps video store buyers and their customers figure that any series with this many installments has to have something going for it. But they'd be wrong." In many of the movies in the series the acting is quite poor by reasonable standards, with the actors sometimes even stumbling over their lines. The sex scenes are often unrealistic and extremely - laughably - fake looking (intercourse movements will be taking place in scenes but in numerous shots you can plainly see the male actor wearing underwear and his genitals will over a foot away from those of the female).
Video Reviewer 22 Shots found that the first 4 movies has a small amount of low budget, cheesy charm, the rest of the series " went more exploitative and sleazy" and were only recommended for fans of ultra-low budget films.
The series claims to be the longest-running horror movie series. "The Amityville Horror" series is longer, having 18 films, but none of the films are direct sequels to each other and parts I, II, and IV are the only films based on books from the Amityville book series that establish references with each other.

Ly Erg

The Ly Erg is a fairy from Scottish folklore, particularly associated with the area in and around the Glenmore Forest, part of the present-day Cairngorms National Park. It is dressed as a soldier, distinguishable from a real soldier only by its red right hand, said to be stained with the blood of its victims. While out walking it will stop near water, and by raising its right hand challenge passersby to fight. But anyone who engages in combat with the Ly Erg will be dead within a fortnight, win or lose.
Writing in 1847, the antiquarian Joseph Robertson tells of three brothers who fought the Ly Erg, each of them dying immediately after their encounter.

GALE (singer)

Carolina Isabel Colón Juarbe (born May 16, 1993), better known by her stage name GALE (pronounced gah-leh), is a Puerto Rican singer, songwriter and actress, best known for her song "Levántate", which was selected as the official song of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup in Spanish by the American Spanish-Language broadcast television network Univision.
Early Life and career.
GALE was born May 16, 1993 in Arecibo, Puerto Rico to a family of musicians. Her grandfather played the cuatro and her father is a musician and guitarist. Growing up, GALE was certain that singing and songwriting was going to be her profession in life. As a child, she imitated Christina Aguilera, Selena, and Shakira, who are some of her early musical influences, and wrote her first song at the age of 8 titled "Amor Sincero".
At the age of 12, GALE and her mother move to San Juan where she began to receive formal musical education at the Escuela Libre de Música, an academic and music school from Puerto Rico, where she specialized in guitar and classical singing and was a member of the school choir. GALE also took private lessons with locally renowned vocal coach Hilda Ramos.
During her high-school years, she begins to train in musical theatre as a member of the Black Box Theatre Workshop in Puerto Rico, later participating in the musical plays Rent, Spring Awakening, Contratiempo, and Viva Julia de Burgos. Musical theatre contributed to her stage presence and artistic development.
During her college years GALE began posting covers on her YouTube channel and singing at local gigs and festivals in Puerto Rico. One of her covers was for "Que No" a song by Puerto Rican singer Pedro Capó who, after seeing the cover, invited GALE to sing with him at one of his concerts. GALE later won a contest to sing with Draco Rosa in front of a sold-out crowd at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico.
After receiving a bachelor's degree in Advertising from the University of Puerto Rico and a certification in songwriting from Berklee College of Music, GALE moves to Miami in 2016 to pursue her professional singing career and begins the production of her first single as an independent artist titled "Fantasma", an Electropop song of her composition and the production of Colombian producer Juan Andres Ceballos, aka Nito. The song was launched digitally on October 25, 2016. Soon after, she began to work on the production of her first album titled "Espirales Sin Sentido", which she funded by selling her 10-year-old SUV and an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.
As the album was being produced, she released two other singles of her composition: “Caramelo”, a Latin Pop track written and produced by herself and the pop ballad "Respirar" at the beginning of 2017. On June 23, 2017 GALE self-released her debut album "Espirales Sin Sentido" under her own label Blue Madness Records, a 10-song album which includes the participation of producer Juan Ceballos and Grammy winners Dan Warner and Felipe Tichauer.
On June 25, 2017 Univision announced on its flagship show República Deportiva that it selected "Levántate", a dance song from the album, as the official song of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup for the promotion and coverage of the soccer tournament. The song was written and produced by GALE and Juan Andres Ceballos and became the promotional single of the album during that time. GALE followed up with "Incontrolable", a dancehall infused track, later that year.
GALE's album promotion came to a halt when Hurricane Maria hit her homeland of Puerto Rico. After experiencing the devastation caused by the force of nature, GALE wrote a song for the people of Puerto Rico called "Aquí estamos" which she released on January 19, 2018.
“Como Cuando" is the latest single off of "Espirales Sin Sentido" released February 20, 2018.

Battle of Skałat

Battle of Skalat in 1657 was part of The Deluge.
Prelude.
In accordance with Treaty of Radnot, in January 1657, the Transylvanian army of 25,000 crossed the Carpathians, joined with Zaporozhian Cossacks and set off towards Kraków, where the situation of the Swedish garrison was desperate. On March 21, Rákóczi captured Tarnów, and on March 28, he reached Kraków. Along the way to the ancient Polish capital, the Transylvanian-Cossack army burned and looted towns and villages, murdering thousands. Since his army was too busy looting Lesser Poland, only 5,000 soldiers reached Kraków, which by the Treaty of Radnot, was to be ruled by Transylvania. On May 13, Rákóczi and Charles X Gustav seized the fortress of Brześć Litewski, and on May 17, after a three-day siege, the Swedes, Cossacks, and Transylvanians captured Warsaw. Soon afterwards, however, the Dano-Swedish War began, and Charles X Gustav left Poland with most of his troops. The ruler of Transylvania began a quick retreat southwards, but on July 11, was defeated in Battle of Magierów, and on July 20, the Transylvanian-Cossack army was completely destroyed in the Battle of Czarny Ostrów. Three days later, Rákóczi signed a peace treaty with the Commonwealth, in which he promised to break the alliance with Sweden, withdraw his troops from Poland, and pay for the damage inflicted by his army.
Battle.
On July 26, 1657, at the Skalat, Crimean Tatars, allied with Poland, surrounded retreating remnants of Transilvanian army. The Tatars killed 500 Transilvanians, capturing 11,000.
Aftermath.
While Rákóczi himself managed to escape, his entire army of 25.000 was annihilated in less than 5 months, with the survivors enslaved.

Pier Hotel, Glenelg

The Pier Hotel was a public inn in Glenelg in the British colony, then Australian state, of South Australia.
History.
The foundation stone for "Moseley's Pier Hotel", as it was originally named, was laid by the Mayor, R. B. Colley, on 7 June 1856. Among official guests were Sir John Morphett.
The Pier Hotel opened Christmas Day 1856. It was a three-storey affair, to a design by architect John William Holmes, and built by Henry J. Moseley, who then operated the hotel as proprietor and publican. Only the first floor had a balcony; it is likely that the second floor was for the publican's private use.
Its naming was not only premature, as the pier (or "jetty" in SA parlance) was not opened until 1859, but also prescient, as its placement was a matter for debate until 1857. The first cargo unloaded at the new jetty was 200 tons of coal off the barque "Anna" for Henry Moseley on 7 November 1865.
His son Henry Moseley, jun. was for a time landlord of the "Pier", but moved on when he declared insolvency despite a great deal of financial assistance from his father.
Patronage was boosted when the Adelaide and Glenelg Railway, which became the Glenelg tram line, went into service on 2 August 1873, bringing in holidaymakers and customers who had leisure time and spending money but did not own a horse and carriage.
In 1876 the building was enlarged by another ten rooms and additional bathing facilities added.
The Holdfast Bay railway line gave a further boost to tourism in the area from 1880.
At some stage Francis J. Botting (1819–1906), owner of the Haussen &amp; Co. brewery, acquired the Pier Hotel. He was also owner of the Family Hotel, Glenelg.
Owners of freehold 1910 F. J. Botting trading as Haussen &amp; Co.
The "Pier" rebuilt and demolished.
In 1908 the owner, Mrs Botting, supplied the Glenelg Council with plans for a proposed replacement hotel, costed at £20,000, provided that the law could be amended to allow of a Company licence.
The Quorn Mercury of 7 October 1910 reported on the "WINDSOR CASTLE HOTEL, Victoria Square West, A. E. Hastwell, Proprietor, Late of Pier Hotel. Glenelg."
In 1910 the Licensing Bench expressed concerns about the condition of the building, and intimated it might not be licensed the following year.
Following Botting's death in 1910 ownership was restructured as The Pier Hotel (Glenelg) Proprietary, shareholder base largely consisting of his testamentaries. Demolition of the hotel began in early 1911 and over 18 months the new hotel built by architect J. Q. Bruce, contractor B. Sutherland, and reopened in November 1912. It had a frontage to the sea of , again of three storeys, the upper two having private balconies on the sea side. A rooftop garden was a feature; it had a balustrade all round. Electric lighting, fans and heaters and electric lifts were among the modern creature comforts, and boasted of "catering for only the best class of people". George Frederick Fox was appointed manager. By Feb 1919 the Government Gazette listed Henry J. Crabb as manager.
Leaseholder Arthur J. Jackman, formerly of Jackman's Grand Cafe, Rundle St. (which became Balfour's) to March 1924. A "temperance permit" (a type of licence to open a licensed premises outside liquor trading hours, to sell 'non-intoxicating liquor') in 1920. The Government Gazette of 27 July 1922 lists an application for renewal with additional bar.
Mr. M. P. Crowe, late of Port Lincoln, bought the leasehold from Jackman in 1924, with 18 years to run. He applied to renew his licence in 1925, as listed in the S.A. Government Gazette of Feb. 12 of that year.
Demolition of the "Pier" began in 1988 and was replaced by the Ramada Grand Hotel, opened on 5 October 1990. It was renamed Stamford Grand Hotel.
The name "Pier Hotel" has since been adopted for another establishment in the vicinity, founded in 2001 at the end of the Anzac Highway.
After its demolition, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Misia Candle Night 2017

Misia Candle Night 2017 was a concert tour by Japanese singer Misia and the sixth installment of the Misia Candle Night concert series. The tour spanned four shows across two locations. The first two shows were held in May 2017, at the Sengan-en in Kagoshima to commemorate its World Heritage Site declaration. The second leg of the tour began and ended with two shows at Kawaguchiko Stellar Theater in Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi in August 2017.
First leg.
On January 16, 2017, the first leg of the tour, dubbed Dai-sanjūsan-kai JTB Sekai Isan Gekijō: Kagoshima Sengan-en Sekai Isan Tōroku Kinen Misia Candle Night (第33回JTB世界遺産劇場‐鹿児島 仙巌園‐ 世界遺産登録記念 Misia Candle Night) and consisting of two shows scheduled for March 25-26, 2017 at the Japanese garden Sengan-en, to celebrate it receiving the distinction of World Heritage Site, was announced. On March 2, 2017, Misia issued a statement through her official website and social media saying that she had been hospitalized with acute viral hepatitis and would have to postpone her upcoming guest appearance at the benefit concert The Unforgettable Day 3.11, as well as the two Misia Candle Night dates. A week later, Misia posted on her instagram that she had been discharged from the hospital and was recuperating at home. The Misia Candle Night shows were re-scheduled for May 27-28, 2017.
On March 31, 2017, a poll was set up through Misia's official mobile app World of Misia where fans could vote for which songs they would like Misia to cover in concert. The top ten vote-getters, including Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing", which Misia covered earlier in 2017 for the Japanese dub of the movie "Sing", Miyuki Nakajima's "Ito" (糸) and Koji Tamaki's "Melody" (メロディー) at the top of the list, were revealed on May 26, 2017.
The charity Candle Night Bar also took place this year and 420,835 yen were raised to be redistributed through the non-profit organization Mudef towards sponsoring the Magoso school in Nairobi's Kibera Slum's entrance into the local music festival.

John K. Rafferty

John K. "Jack" Rafferty (May 1, 1938 – February 17, 2021) was an American politician who served as the Mayor of Hamilton Township, New Jersey from 1976 to 1999 and in the New Jersey General Assembly from the 14th Legislative District from 1986 to 1988.
Early life and education.
Rafferty was born on May 1, 1938 to Mae Knox Rafferty and Francis Peter Rafferty, a tool and die maker. His family were Irish, Catholic, and supporters of the Democratic Party. He later described his father as a "dyed-in-the-wool" Democrat.
After growing up in Hamilton Township and graduating from Trenton Catholic High School, Rafferty enrolled in the Navy, serving aboard the USS Randolph for two years. After leaving the Navy, he received an associate in arts degree from Trenton Junior College. He graduated from La Salle University with a pre-law degree in 1963 and then received his law degree from University of Kentucky College of Law in 1966.
After law school, Rafferty clerked for U.S. District Court Judge George H. Barlow and worked as a legal analyst for the New Jersey Division of Taxation. Governor William T. Cahill appointed Rafferty as Director of the Division of Administrative Procedure. He left state government in 1974, upon the inauguration of Democratic Governor Brendan Byrne.
Political career.
Rafferty made his first run for political office in 1968, when he was an unsuccessful candidate for Mercer County Freeholder.
In 1969, Rafferty was elected to the Hamilton Township council. He was the first Republican elected to the council in 19 years. He served for six terms.
In 1971, Rafferty ran for the New Jersey Assembly to represent Hamilton, Trenton, and Washington Township (District 6B). He ran to fill the seat left vacant by Joseph Merlino. He and Republican running mate Peter Rossi lost the race for the multi-member district to Hamilton recreation director Francis J. McManimon and incumbent S. Howard Woodson.
In 1976, Rafferty won the first open election for mayor of Hamilton following the ratification of the township's new charter, becoming the first Republican mayor of the township in 26 years. He attended the 1976 Republican National Convention as a delegate pledged to President Gerald Ford.
In 1980, after appeals from John P. Sears, Rafferty agreed to serve as the director of Ronald Reagan's New Jersey campaign. Rafferty claimed that he only agreed to serve on the Reagan campaign once he was satisfied that he and Reagan were "philosophically compatible in their politics." Rafferty considered himself a "moderate" Republican who was "moderate-to-liberal" on some issues. After Sears was ousted as Reagan's campaign manager, Rafferty was replaced by Raymond J. Donovan. 
Following the indictment of incumbent U.S. Representative Frank Thompson, Rafferty was approached to run for the seat in 1980, replacing lesser-known Republican nominee Chris Smith. Rafferty declined. Smith won the race and remains the U.S. Representative for Hamilton as of .
In 1981, Rafferty ran for Governor of New Jersey. He hoped to capitalize on his association with now-President Reagan, but finished a distant seventh in the Republican primary, which was won by eventual Governor Thomas Kean.
In 1985, while still serving as Mayor, Rafferty was elected to the New Jersey Assembly amid a Republican wave election. He unseated incumbent Joseph D. Patero. He served one term and did not run for re-election in 1987. Rafferty intended to challenge Francis McManimon for State Senate in 1987, but after polling showed that both his Assembly seat and mayoral seat were at risk, he refocused on his work as mayor.
In 1999, Rafferty retired rather than run for re-election to a seventh term as Mayor.
Retirement.
After retiring from office, Rafferty remained active in local politics and served as executive director of the Hamilton Partnership, a business group that promotes cooperation among its members and works with the township to attract more businesses to town. He was elected to the New Jersey Republican Party State Committee in 2017.
Personal life.
Rafferty married Doris Tramontana, with whom he had two children, Megan and Daniel.
Death.
Rafferty died on February 17, 2021, in Hamilton Township, New Jersey at age 82.

Sienna Shields

Sienna Shields (born 1976) is an American abstract artist specializing in large-format collage pieces. She was also the chief organizer of the HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican? artist collective and the director of its digital work, "Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera" which was accepted for the 2014 Whitney Biennial.
Early life.
Shields was born in Alaska in 1976. Both her parents were teachers and she and two siblings were home-schooled for a time while living outside Anchorage. She graduated from Lewis &amp; Clark College, Portland, Oregon with a degree in Caribbean and Latin American history in 1998. in 2001, she moved to the DUMBO collective in Brooklyn.
Artistic style.
Shields's working process has been influenced by the "energy and chaos" of the collectives in which she lived for much of her working life. Many of her works are variations on collages of acrylic paint and multiple layers of cut or torn paper, assembled into large abstract pieces. She developed this working style after college in part due to financial restraints. Other works include bead sculptures, mixed media art, and digital imagery.
2014 Whitney Biennial.
The Whitney Biennial of contemporary art is an invitation-only exhibition which generally favors young artists and in the past helped bring greater recognition to artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock and Jeff Koons. The Biennial has often faced criticism over issues of privilege, access and inclusivity. Shields organized the Yams Collective (short for HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican?) of 38 international mostly black and queer musicians, poets, actors, writers and visual artists to create a digital film about racial identity for the 2014 edition. Shields was encouraged by this diversity, saying: "I’d go to art events, and I’d be the only black person in the room — here in New York. It was ridiculous." One of the Biennial's curators, Michelle Grabner, had visited Shields in her studio and seen a short video loop she had made in Alaska. This became the instigation for the collective's submission, a 53-minute digital piece in 35 parts titled "Good Stock on the Dimension Floor: An Opera".
Despite the collective's membership, one of the few individual black female artists invited that year was "Donelle Woolford", a creation of Joe Scanlan. Scanlan, a white, male, Princeton University professor hired a succession of actresses to play "Woolford" at events. The inclusion of this "fake" artist led the Yams Collective to withdraw their submission, objecting to "Woolford's" inclusion in a show alongside their work. Shields explained the withdrawal was due to not only Scanlan but also:"...the history of the Whitney and its lack of any kind of initiative in changing its white supremacist attitudes." The collective also considered the inclusion of Scanlan to be a reflection of larger issues of racism in the elite art world. The film instead premiered at the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival.
Personal life.
Shields married fellow artist Chuck Close in 2013 and he included her as a subject in his 2017 series "Subway Portraits" although they had by that time divorced.

William de Ormesby

William de Ormesby (died 1317) was a 13th-14th century English judge. He was the Justice of Scotland between 1296 and 1297 after the invasion of Scotland by England in 1296. 
Life.
His family originated from the village of Ormesby, in East Norfolk. On 10 April 1292 he was appointed, with Hugh de Cressingham and others as justice in eyre in the counties of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, with special injunctions to hear and determine complaints against the king's bailiffs and ministers. His commission was extended on 28 August to include Northumberland. In 1296 he became a justice in the court of king's bench. Ormesby met King Edward I of England at Berwick on the king's return from his triumphant progress through Scotland. At that meeting Ormesby was appointed Justice of Scotland. Edward I requested that Ormesby exact homage and fealty from the Scottish tenants in chief, which Ormesby carried out with unflinching severity and with no politic respect to persons, driving into exile all those who refused the oaths to Edward I.
With the absence of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and Hugh de Cressingham in England, Ormesby bore the chief weight of responsibility for Edward's harsh rule over the Scots. When William Wallace's revolt broke out in May 1297, Ormesby was attacked by Wallace at Scone. Ormesby who had been given warning at the last moment, succeeded in escaping, having to leave all his personal property. After the English defeat at the battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September, Ormesby was appointed on 23 October to raise foot soldiers in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire for the further campaign against the Scots. In March 1298 he was summoned to a council in London and continued duties at the king's bench. In 1305 he was also chief of the justices of trailbaston assigned for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.
Ormesby continued to act as a judge under King Edward II of England, though it is not known whether he continued at the king's bench. William continued to be summoned with the judges to parliament until his death and served as justice of assize in the eastern counties, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. In April 1311, Ormesby was appointed with three others to act as justices of common pleas in the liberties of the bishopric of Durham. Ormesby died before 12 June 1317, which was the date his executors were ordered to send to the crown the rolls, writs, and other records in his possession as justice itinerant in the eastern counties. He was buried in the Benedictine monastery of St. Benet's, Hulme.
Marriage and issue.
William is known to have married Sybilla, the widow of Roger Loveday.

Current Expected Credit Losses

Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) is a credit loss accounting standard (model) that was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on June 16, 2016. CECL replaces the current Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) accounting standard. The CECL standard focuses on estimation of expected losses over the life of the loans, while the current standard relies on incurred losses.
Background.
The financial crisis of 2007-2008 demonstrated that the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) accounting standard does not allow for timely adjustment of reserve levels based on reasonable expectation of future conditions. It relies on losses that are incurred but not realized, i.e., when it is known with some certainty that future cash flows will not be collected. During the crisis, negative outlook of the economy was not taken into account for losses calculations. As a result, reserves were not adjusted for future expected losses. The FASB reviewed the standard and replaced it with CECL. CECL requires expected losses to be estimated over the remaining life of the loans, as opposed to incurred losses of the current standard.
FASB stated that the new standard will improve “financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve predicted that industry allowances would go up by 30% to 50%.
CECL impact.
CECL is expected to have a substantial impact on multiple financial institutions.
CECL criticism.
The Bank Policy Institute points out that CECL forces banks to recognize expected future losses immediately, but does not allow them to recognize immediately the higher expected future interest earnings banks receive as compensation for risk. This could result in a decrease in availability of lending to non-prime borrowers, stunting economic recovery following a downturn.
Another criticism regarding CECL is that in order to estimate expected credit losses, banks are required to forecast the state of the economy. As noted by the American Bankers Association (ABA), “Forecasting is difficult, even for the experts… forecasting organizations largely missed forecasting the financial crisis and openly admit the difficulty in forecasting turns in the economic cycle.” Additionally, CECL was implemented primarily to force banks to maintain countercyclical reserves. Per the "American Banker", all thorough analyses of the effect of the new rules have shown, to differing degrees, that allowances will continue to be procyclical after CECL comes into force during 2020.

In addition to her career as a poet, Lubrin teaches at OCAD University and the University of Toronto and worked as an editor with Buckrider Books, an imprint of Canadian independent press Wolsak &amp; Wynn from 2018 to 2021. She was also a director of the Pivot Reading Series, a biweekly poetry reading series in Toronto. For 2017–2018, Lubrin was a Writer-in-Residence with Poetry In Voice. In 2021, publisher McClelland &amp; Stewart announced Lubrin as their new poetry editor.
Lubrin's second collection of poetry, "The Dyzgraphxst", was published by McClelland &amp; Stewart in 2020.
In 2021, Lubrin was named one of two winners, alongside Natalie Scenters-Zapico, of the Windham-Campbell Literature Prize in poetry. Dionne Brand was also named a winner of the Windham-Campbell prize in the fiction category, the first time in the history of that award that two Canadians were named as laureates in the same year.
"The Dyzgraphxst" was shortlisted for the Governor General's Award for English-language poetry at the 2020 Governor General's Awards, was a finalist for the 2020 Trillium Book Award for Poetry and won the 2021 Griffin Poetry Prize.

Narkeldanga

Narkeldanga is a neighbourhood in North Kolkata in Kolkata district in the Indian state of West Bengal.
History.
The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as "Dihi Panchannagram" and Narkeldanga was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.
Geography.
Police district.
Narkeldanga police station is part of the Eastern Suburban division of Kolkata Police. It is located at 6/1, Dr.M.N.Chatterjee Sarani, Kolkata-700 009.

Bromley, New Zealand

Bromley is a suburb of the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. It lies to the east of the city centre, mostly between Pages Road and the Avon river estuary.
History.
Bromley was named after the town in north-west Kent in England.
In 1883, a sewage farm was established next to the Avon estuary. This was later developed when sewage works were built between 1958 and 1962. As of 2018, the area includes oxidation ponds and a wildlife reserve.
From 1913, Christchurch City Council looked for additional cemetery space and one of the options under consideration was a reserve that the city owned in Bromley, which at the time was located in Heathcote County. In 1915, the designation of the land was changed, preparatory work happened in 1917, and in July the Bromley Cemetery opened for burials. This was just prior to the 1918 flu pandemic and the new cemetery became the main burial ground for flu victims from the eastern part of the city. The cemetery was extended in size in 1940. Ruru Lawn Cemetery opened in 1941 and is the burial ground for the victims of the 1947 Ballantyne's fire. Memorial Park Cemetery has been in use since 1956 and, like Ruru Lawn Cemetery, is operational.
The various parks and cemeteries in Bromley form a buffer between the residential area in the west, and the industrial area and sewage treatment plant in the east. The exception is Maces Road, where the north side is industrial and the south side is residential. Like other suburbs in the east of Christchurch, and in proximity to the Avon River or the Avon Heathcote Estuary, Bromley suffered great damage in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. None of the land in the suburb was red zoned, though.

Double-collared crescentchest

The double-collared crescentchest ("Melanopareia bitorquata") is a species of bird in the family Melanopareiidae. It is found in eastern Bolivia.
Taxonomy and systematics.
The crescentchests (genus "Melanopareia") were previously included in family Rhinocryptidae, the tapaculos. A 2010 publication confirmed earlier work and created their present genus. The International Ornithological Congress (IOC) recognizes the double-collared crescentchest as a species. However, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) and the Clements taxonomy consider it to be a subspecies of collared crescentchest ("Melanopareia torquata bitorquata").
Description.
The double-collared crescentchest has a similar pattern to that of the collared crescentchest but the colors are deeper or different in several areas. Its upper parts are olive brown rather than brown and the underparts a deep ochre instead of buff. It has the same black-bordered white supercilium but the "collar" at the back of the neck is a deeper rufous shade and has a black border.
Distribution and habitat.
The double-collared crescentchest is found in Bolivia's Santa Cruz Department and the western edge of Brazil's Mato Grosso State. It inhabits cerrado, a biome characterized by a mix of savannah and woodlands.
Behavior.
The double-collared crescentchest's diet has not been described but the species is assumed to be insectivorous. Examples of its song are here .
Status.
The IUCN has not assessed the double-collared crescentchest.

Vehicle registration plates of Peru

Peru requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates. Current plates are North American standard 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm).
All vehicles are required to display plates on the front and back. Peculiarly, taxis in Peru are also required to display the characters of the license plates on each side of the vehicle. This is done with a large decal.
1924 - 1973: Early plates.
License plates issued up to 1973 came in a variety of colors and styles. Many years had city names placed on them which created a variety of different plates issued each year.
1974 - 1995 Series.
The first letter of these plates indicated the vehicle type, and the chart below shows the letters assigned to each type. The second letter indicated the region (or province for the City of Lima) where the vehicle was registered. The second chart below shows these codes.
1995 - 2009 Series.
Plates issued during the years 1995 - 2009 continued to use the same format that was begun in 1975. The first letter continued to indicate the vehicle type, and the second letter indicated the region or province. These plates were black characters on a yellow background and they continued to use the same format, ABC-123, until all combinations in a region or province were exhausted. When complete, the old series was followed by plates with black characters on a white background, but they used the format AB-1234.
2010 Series.
The redesign of the Peruvian plates included many changes. The national flag of Peru is displayed in color, without the shield, in the upper left hand corner. The word Peru is centered at the top in all capital letters. There is a holographic label at the top right with the plate number and nanotext, and any attempt to remove it will cause its destruction. The background to the plate has reflective sheeting which contains a high security seal (watermark). At the lower left of the plate a security serial number is laser engraved into the plate. In the background of the center of the plate is a three-dimensional interwoven sine wave. The plates are made of aluminum and are 150 mm tall by 300 mm wide except for motorcycles which are 110 mm tall by 190 mm wide. The holographic seal is also smaller on the motorcycle plates. 
Region and province codes.
The new series of plates began to be issued in January 2010. The first character of the plate continued to designate the region or province, but the letters were reassigned to different regions. With the new plate colors representing the vehicle type, the second character no longer represented the vehicle type.
Regular Series plates.
The second character of these plates first takes on a numerical value of 1 to 9 (in order) followed by the number 0, and then the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order. All vehicles now are issued the so-called "third plate" which is a windshield sticker that includes an RFID chip. The RFID chip allows the police to electronically verify the registration of the vehicle with a hand-held reader. The third plate cannot be removed from the windshield without it being destroyed.
Special Series plates.
All Special Series plates are easily distinguished by the small letter "E," representing the Spanish word "especial", as the first character at the left hand side of the plate. To prevent confusion, the letter "E" is not used to identify any region or province. 
Papal visit.
For the visit of the Roman Catholic Pope, Francis, from 18-21 January 2018, special license plates were created. These plates have all of the same security features as regular plates, but the coloring, yellow and white which are the official colors of the Holy See, the lettering, and the use of the coat of arms of the Vatican, are unique to these plates. Three license plates of the style shown here were produced. Additionally, there were 30 Exhibition plates issued for the Papal delegation.

Benham Historic District

The Benham Historic District is a historic district encompassing ten buildings and a public park in Benham, Kentucky. The buildings form the historic center of the coal town of Benham. Benham was founded by Wisconsin Steel, a subsidiary of International Harvester, in 1912; its major buildings were built between 1919 and 1928, replacing the original buildings as the town grew. Mining operations declined during the Great Depression, and as a result the district represents the main period of development in the town. The buildings in the district include Benham's city hall, post office, grade school, Methodist church, jail, theatre, hospital, firehouse, company store, and meat market.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 21, 1983. The company store is now home to the Kentucky Coal Museum.

Harlan Commercial District

The Harlan Commercial District is a primarily commercial historic district in downtown Harlan, Kentucky. The district is centered on the Harlan County Courthouse and includes 41 buildings which contribute to its historic character. While Harlan was founded much earlier as a rural town, it grew considerably when the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad built a line through the city in 1911; all of the contributing buildings within the district were built between 1910 and 1936. Nearly all of the buildings feature commercial-style architecture; the exceptions are the Classical Revival courthouse and post office and one Moderne commercial building. Downtown Harlan served as the social, civic, and economic center of the Harlan County mining community, particularly during the mining boom of the 1920s, and the courthouse became the site of several murder trials and legal battles during the Harlan County War.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 20, 1986.

Clarence Bolton

Clarence Wheeler Bolton (September 16, 1893 – January 7, 1962) was an American painter and lithographer from Woodstock, New York. He was a prominent member of the Woodstock Art Colony in the early and mid-20th century whose works have been exhibited throughout the United States and internationally.
Early life.
Bolton was born and raised in Wallingford, Connecticut. He attended the School of Fine Arts at Yale beginning in 1913, where he studied sculpture under Lee Lawrie, who created the sculpture of Atlas at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Because of his frail health, he was unable to complete his studies and graduate; in 1917 he was exempted from the draft due to pulmonary tuberculosis.
In 1917 Bolton traveled to Woodstock to visit a friend who lived there and to play a musical gig, and fell in love with the town. Bolton remained in Woodstock for the rest of his life.
In 1921, he met Mary Louise Cashdollar, from a prominent Woodstock family, and they married in 1922.
Career.
In Woodstock, Bolton became enthralled with the local Catskill Mountains landscape, and so, in his words, “sort of forsook” sculpture in favor of focusing on landscape painting. He quickly began studying landscape painting under John F. Carlson, a prominent landscape painter who in 1911-1918 had headed the summertime Woodstock School of the Art Students League. Bolton later took up lithography, again focusing on landscapes. He was one of the first members of the Woodstock Artists Association.
During the Great Depression, Bolton was engaged to paint federal government artwork, most notably working jointly with Charles Rosen in painting the murals at the Beacon, New York, Post Office, which was visited by Eleanor Roosevelt when it was nearing completion. It was during this work for the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Arts Project that Bolton became interested and studied lithography.
Bolton produced woodcut and linoleum-cut prints, many of which appeared in his publication, "The Clatter." He also painted signs for Woodstock-area businesses. Bolton’s artwork was often made into Christmas cards. He also ventured into textile design, and in 1928 won first prize out of some 1,500 entrants in the textile design competition held in New York City by the Art Alliance.
Bolton also purchased a press, on which he published in 1930-1931 a magazine entitled "The Clatter." The material was a mix of Bolton’s own articles and opinion pieces on art, the seasons, and local events, as well as short stories, poetry, and humor pieces; it also included writings by others. It was illustrated with his own woodcut and linoleum-cut prints.
Bolton was most notable for his lithographs, especially for his high level of technical expertise and technique. His style has been described as being stylistically linked with Precisionism which flourished when Bolton was most active. While most of his subjects were traditional serene landscapes and scenes of local village life, he gave their portrayals a highly original, personal twist that also reflected contemporary American and international trends in painting. This can be seen, for example, in his lithographs "Politics, Country Church, In the Woods, Still Waters, Butternut Trees, Solitude, March Winds, and The Birches."
Bolton’s work has been exhibited locally in the Catskills area, in major U.S. art venues and internationally. In addition to numerous local exhibitions and exhibitions at several university art museums, notable exhibition venues of his works have included the Library of Congress, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Corcoran Gallery, the Kennedy Galleries in New York City, the Denver Art Museum, and in London at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
Bolton received a number of prizes and honors in addition to the above-mentioned textile design prize, including the Warren H. Manning Purchase Prize of the Southern Society, (1938), and the Purchase Prize of the Oklahoma Art League (1939).
Personal life.
He and his wife Louise collaborated in local Woodstock business ventures. In the early and mid-1920s they owned a soda fountain café called The Nook, which was a hangout for the students at the Art Students League of New York who studied next door, and where artworks were exhibited. Later, after WWII, he assisted Louise in running her antique shop at The Red Barn, tending shop and refinishing early American furniture.
Bolton retained his interest in music. He was an accomplished mandolinist, and also frequently played the piano at dances, hotels, and social events. He also played piano as the live musical accompaniment to silent movies in the local movie hall.

Jürgen von Hagen

Jürgen von Hagen (born in Iserlohn on December 14, 1955) is a German economist and professor at the University of Bonn, where he currently also serves as director of the Institute for International Economic Policy. He was awarded the Gossen Prize in 1997.
Biography.
A native of Iserlohn, Jürgen von Hagen studied at the University of Bonn, where he earned a diploma and a Ph.D. in economics in 1981 and 1986. During his Ph.D. studies, von Hagen worked as a research assistant at the university's Institute for International Economic Policy (1981–87). After his graduation, he worked as assistant professor and later as associate professor of business economics and public policy at Indiana University (1987–92) before following a call by the University of Mannheim back to Germany in 1992. There, he took over the direction of the Institute for Advanced Studies, before moving back to his alma mater, the University of Bonn, in 1996 as director of the Center for European Integration Studies. Since 2006, von Hagen has directed the Institute for International Economic Policy.
Professionally, von Hagen is affiliated with the European Economic Association and the Centre for Economic Policy Research - of which he is a fellow - as well as with the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Additionally, he is also affiliated with the American Economic Association, Econometric Society, and the Verein für Socialpolitik. Moreover, von Hagen performs editorial duties for a number of academic journals, including the "European Journal of Political Economy", "Journal of Money, Credit and Banking" and the "Scottish Journal of Political Economy" and previously worked as editor for the "European Economic Review". Finally, von Hagen has acted as a consultant for many international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, and European Commission.
Research.
Jürgen von Hagen is one of the leading scholars on the macroeconomics of European integration, the Eurozone, and European public finance. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Jürgen von Hagen belongs to the top 2% of economists.
European public finance.
After early work on the monetary policy of West Germany in the 1980s, von Hagen (with Michele Fratianni) turned towards the study of the European Monetary System (EMS) and Germany's role within it. In particular, they argued that - despite the relative monetary weakness of France and Italy - Germany had merely an independent but not a dominant role within the EMS . Another set of studies by Jürgen von Hagen (together with Kerstin Bernoth, Ludger Schuknecht and Guido Wolswijk) compares the bond yield spreads between countries within the EMU and Canada, analyses the impact of the financial crisis on these spreads, and between EU Member States. They notably find that risk premia increase with fiscal imbalances such as difficulties regarding deficit and debt service payments, making expansionary fiscal policy more expensive.
A substantial body of von Hagen's academic work relates to the relationship between countries' fiscal governance, fiscal institutions and fiscal performance. Within this body of research, von Hagen has highlighted the effectiveness of formal fiscal restraints at the state level in the United States and the importance of centralized budget processes and commitments to maintain fiscal discipline (with Ian Harden). Later research has further emphasized the importance of the political setting within which fiscal decisions are taken. Studying the impact of fiscal rules in the European Union, von Hagen (with Guntram Wolff) finds that the Stability and Growth Pact induced EU governments to increase their use of creative accounting to hide fiscal deficits through stock-flow adjustments, especially during recessions, but had hardly any impact on the success or failure of attempts at fiscal consolidation among European countries in the 1990s; by contrast, von Hagen, Andrew Hughes Hallett and Rolf Strauch find that the economic conditions within which fiscal consolidations were begun in the EU during the 1990s had a strong impact on their likelihood of success by influencing governments' choices among consolidation strategies. Finally, research by von Hagen with Strauch and Mark Hallerberg finds that the centralisation of budgeting procedures was successful in reducing public debt among EU Member States by adjusting the flexibility of fiscal decision-making to the political alignment of the government (coalition), with e.g. fiscal contracts providing an effective commitment device within "ideologically dispersed" coalitions.
European monetary economics and the macroeconomics of European integration.
Jürgen von Hagen has also published extensively on the macroeconomics of European integration and the Eurozone. Before the Eurozone's conception, in the mid-1990s, von Hagen (and Manfred Neumann) supported the vision of a "Europe of Two Speeds", with a monetary union including Germany, France, Benelux, Sweden and Austria that would allow the remaining economies within the EU to converge more quickly with this core union; failing that, he cautioned against the creation of a monetary union before such adjustments would have occurred. Moreover, he already emphasized in the 1990s the risk that excessive budget deficits in the Eurozone may pressure the European Central Bank to violate its fiscal restrictions and bail out excessively indebted governments ex post (by monetizing the government's debt) or ex ante (by keeping interest rates very low), thus in turn priming the Eurozone for high inflation (with Barry Eichengreen).
More general contributions by von Hagen to monetary economics include his analysis (with Manfred Neumann) of the effectiveness of inflation targeting throughout the 1990s, wherein they conclude that it was effective in reducing the level and volatility of inflation by improving the credibility of central bank's monetary policies and his study of the determinants of banking crises (with Tai-Kuang Ho), which finds only a negligible role for money base growth on the likelihood of banking crises, whereas real GDP slowdown, low real interest rates, hyperinflation, large fiscal deficits and exchange rate overvaluation tend to be reliable predictors of banking crises.
Positions on economic policy.
Mirroring his academic work, Jürgen von Hagen has repeatedly emphasized the importance of fiscal discipline and small fiscal deficits at the German and European level. In 1998, he was one of the signatories of the Petersberg Declaration on a Future-Oriented Labour Market Policy in Germany, which called for the deregulation of labour markets and making unemployment benefits conditional on searching a job (among else). However, von Hagen was also very critical of the Hartz labour market reform, arguing that its focus on labour market matching was misplaced, and instead supported economic stimulus through reductions in corporate taxes, wealth taxes, and value added taxes. During the Eurozone crisis, von Hagen supported sovereign debt restructuring procedures for overly indebted countries over the introduction of Eurobonds, an expansion of the European Financial Stability Mechanism, or structural adjustment programmes.

Quantico (season 3)

The third and final season of American drama thriller series "Quantico" premiered in the United States on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on April 26, 2018, and concluded on August 3, 2018. Produced by ABC Studios, Michael Seitzman served as the showrunner for the third and final season, subsequently replacing series creator Joshua Safran. Executive producers include Mark Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper, and Jorge Zamacona. 
The third and final season consisted of thirteen episodes, down from the twenty-two episode count of the two previous seasons. The season aired on Thursdays in the United States at 10:00 pm. On May 11, 2018, after only three of the thirteen episodes in the season had aired, ABC announced that the series had canceled. On May 14, "Deadline" reported that the network would finish airing the remainder of the third season on Friday nights at 8:00 pm.
Overview.
Three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention, former CIA analyst, Alex Parrish had to escape outside the United States in order to avoid arrest from law enforcement authorities. After living anonymously in Italy, she is forced to return to America after Ryan shared information to her about Shelby's kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Shelby, Ryan and Alex recruit Owen and Harry to help them with their mission. Owen invites Jocelyn Turner to the team as the former FBI agent has intelligence about the arms dealer, due in part to their past history. Owing to the extreme circumstances of the covert operation, the team must retrieve Shelby at all costs, before time runs out.
Episodes.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Production.
Development.
In May 2017, ABC renewed the series for a third season of 13 episodes. As part of the renewal process, Safran stepped down as showrunner of the show but remained as a consultant. The following month, it was announced that Michael Seitzman would be "Quantico" showrunner and Safran would be credited as an executive producer. The third season premiered on April 26, 2018.
Casting.
After the third season renewal announcement, it was reported that Yasmine Al Massri and Pearl Thusi would leave the series, and in June 2017, it was reported that Ellis and Tovey would not return as part of a creative overhaul. However, in August 2017, it was confirmed that Tovey would in fact be returning as a series regular. In late July 2017, Marlee Matlin joined the show as a series regular in the third season. She will play the role of ex-FBI agent, Jocelyn Turner. On November 21, 2017, it was announced that Alan Powell will join the show as a series regular in the third season. He will play Mike McQuigg, an undercover agent. On December 6, 2017, it was announced that Amber Skye Noyes will join the third season in the recurring role of Celine Fox. On January 17, 2018, it was announced that Vandit Bhatt will join the third season in the recurring role of Jagdeep Patel. On February 16, 2018, it was confirmed that Aunjanue Ellis has exited the series.
Filming.
Certain scenes of the third-season premiere were shot on location in Italy. Filming for the third season started on October 10, 2017. In March 2018, it was confirmed by showrunner Michael Seitzman that the last few episodes of the third season would be shot on location in Ireland. Filming for the third season ended on April 21, 2018.
Reception.
Critical response.
The third season received mixed feedback from critics, who were divided over its direction in comparison to its predecessors. The season premiere was poorly received. Despite praising the episode's action and pacing and its introduction of Marlee Matlin's character, Dishya Sharma of the "International Business Times" wrote that "it leaves you asking for more". "The Quint"'s Dipti Kharude said that "the briskness of the episode suffocates it". Mark Perigard of the "Boston Herald" was critical of the season's new format and storylines, writing that it "doubles down on the dumb". During a review of the series finale, "TV Fanatic"'s Allison Nichols praised how the season "show[ed] the team putting the pieces together", but cited the relationship between Ryan and Shelby as unbelievable and "one of the more controversial parts".
Hindu terrorist plot.
The fifth episode of the season, titled "The Blood of Romeo", was criticized by some Indian social media users for its alleged anti-Indian sentiment. In the episode, Alex Parrish (Priyanka Chopra) uncovers a plot by Indian Hindu nationalists to commit a terrorist false flag attack with nuclear weapons in Manhattan, and have it blamed on Pakistan. Users had described the plotline as "ridiculous" and "unrealistic" and felt that it had damaged the image of Indians abroad. In addition, they denounced Chopra's participation in the episode as her international profile had made her a "quasi-ambassador for India in the West". Chopra apologised for any hurt caused by the episode and stated that she was a "proud Indian". ABC also apologised and defended Chopra from what they felt was unfairly aimed criticism commenting that she did not have a role in writing, directing or creating the show.
Indian-born British chef Atul Kochhar's contract at the Rang Mahal restaurant in Dubai was terminated by JW Marriott Marquis Dubai after he made comments criticising Chopra's involvement in the episode, which included allegations that Hindus had been terrorized by Islam for thousands of years. Bangladeshi-American writer Sharbari Zohra Ahmed who had previously worked on "Quantico" but was not involved in the writing of the episode was also targeted on social media. These attacks included threats of violence, including rape.

Prasat Ta Krabey

Prasat Ta Krabey or Prasat Ta Krabei, in Khmer () and also known as Prasat Ta Khwai, in Thai (), is a disputed Khmer temple which was built during Angkor period, the golden age of Cambodian history. This 11th century religious site was constructed in order to be dedicated to Hindu god Shiva and has become a tourist attraction site near Cambodian-Thai border in recent years.
Etymology.
Prasat Ta Krabey literally means "Grandfather Buffalo temple". Prasat () is a Khmer word, derived from Sanskrit word ("prāsāda") (), means "temple". Ta () means "grandfather" and the word Krabey () means "buffalo". 
Plan and features.
Ta Krabey temple consists of a single central sanctuary, where houses a Shiva Linga, named "Svayabhuva Linga" (), which means "the self-emergence Linga" and four gopuras face to all four directions in total area of 900 square meters. This sandstone temple was decorated with some carvings, especially the depiction of god Yama mounts on a buffalo as his vehicle, however the construction work of the temple was unfinished as most of the exterior surface of the central tower has no carving. According to architectural style, this temple was built in 12th or 13th century in Bayon style but it is believed that it started being constructed in 11th century. Nowadays, the temple is surrounded by Dângrêk Mountains jungle that provides cool shade and fresh air for visitors.
Location.
The temple is located on Dangrek mountain range, basically on Cambodian-Thai border, 57 km west of Samraong city which is the capital of Oddar Meanchey province and 13 km away from another Angkorian ancient temple, Prasat Ta Muen Thom. Tourists can travel from Samraong city along the national road 56 and a mountainous concrete road that leads to this ancient site.
Cambodian claimed that this temple is situated in Chher Slap village, Kouk Khpos commune, Banteay Ampil district, Oddar Meanchey province, Cambodia. On the Thai side, its location falls within Phanom Dong Rak District of Surin Province. Ownership of the temple has been subject to the Cambodian–Thai border dispute, and military clashes near the temple occurred in 2008 and 2011.

J. Marvin Brown

James Marvin Brown (January 28, 1925 – August 29, 2002) was an American linguist who studied the evolution of Thai and related languages, supervised the teaching of English and Thai at AUA Language Center, Bangkok, Thailand and developed the Automatic Language Growth approach to language teaching.
Early life.
Brown was born in 1925 to Lawrence M. Brown and Fannie D. Brown (née Parker). He grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Education.
Brown studied Mandarin Chinese as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II. After working in U.S. Naval Intelligence in Washington D.C., where he translated Chinese telegrams, he returned to the University of Utah to study on the G.I. Bill and became a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. In order to extend his studies, he transferred to the University of California. There he began studying Thai under linguist Mary Haas, who had been teaching the language on the Berkeley campus in the Army Specialized Training Program. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in Oriental languages, followed by a Master of Arts degree. He began a Ph.D. in linguistics on a scholarship at the University of California, but moved to Cornell University after J Milton Cowan asked him to teach a planned course in Thai there when William J. Gedney became unavailable. At Cornell he taught Thai and continued his doctoral studies with the Cornell Southeast Asia Program.
In 1953 Brown left for Bangkok to continue his research on Thai linguistics and study of the Thai language and remained in Thailand for four years, funded by grants from the Ford Foundation. Returning to Cornell in 1957, he continued his dissertation work there and taught Thai and Burmese. The next year he obtained a Fulbright Fellowship and returned to Thailand to teach linguistics and English in order to train Thai teachers of English, followed by research for his dissertation. Brown had been working on an analysis of Thai grammar, but with time running out he changed to a historical study involving reconstructing ancient Thai from modern dialects. With students from every province of Thailand attending the teacher training college where he had taught, Brown wrote that he was able to obtain the pronunciations of over 1000 words in each of 70 dialects without difficulty. He returned to Cornell in 1960 to teach Thai and Burmese as a teaching fellow and use the data he had collected to reconstruct the phonology of ancient Thai. Brown refused the offer of an assistant professor position at Cornell, having decided to return to Thailand instead.
Brown completed his dissertation and received his doctorate from Cornell around January 1962. It was published in 1965 as "From Ancient Thai to Modern Dialects" by Social Science Association of Thailand Press and has been republished in subsequent years with other writings by Brown about historical Thai linguistics and his theories about phonology.
AUA Language Center.
Brown returned to Bangkok in March 1962 and was hired as staff linguist at American University Alumni Language Center (AUA) by Gordon F. Schmader, whom he had worked alongside at Cornell writing books to teach English to Thais and Burmese respectively. These texts were based on the "General Form", which AUA had been using to teach English since it had opened in 1952.
As staff linguist at AUA, Brown oversaw the teaching of English to Thais and Thai to foreigners. His work included developing English teaching materials and techniques and training new English teachers. He prepared textbooks to teach Thai to foreigners, producing a popular three-volume course on the spoken language, intended for classroom use with a native speaker of Thai, and books on reading and writing Thai.
Brown left AUA in 1980 to study physics at the University of Utah. He returned to AUA in 1984 and began the teaching of Thai using his version of the natural approach, which he would develop into Automatic Language Growth.
Automatic Language Growth.
Brown is notable for originating the Automatic Language Growth (ALG) approach to language teaching, which claims that adults can effortlessly become near-native or native-like in second languages if they learn them implicitly through experience, without consciously practicing speaking. Brown came to believe that, contrary to the critical period hypothesis that adults have lost the ability to learn languages as children do, adults actually retain this ability but obstruct it by using abilities they have gained to consciously study, practice, and analyze language.
"[Brown's] goal had always been to find a way for an adult to become native in their second language," says David Long, the coordinator of the AUA Thai Program. Beginning with his study of Thai under Mary Haas using the Army Method, also known as the audiolingual method, Brown sought to prove the effectiveness of study and practice to this end. However, he described being confounded by observations over his years in Thailand of people who had studied Thai for fewer hours than him achieving fluency in less time, while others who had studied more than him taking longer to become fluent. At AUA, Brown devised elaborate drills for Thai learners with the goal of having them speak correct English without thinking, but found that these had no effect on real language use.
During the 1970s, Brown was influenced by thinkers such as William T. Powers, taking from his perceptual control theory "that language learning must consist of looking and listening, not practicing," and Timothy Gallwey, from whose "Inner Game" writings he "saw that thinking just got in the way of performance." Nevertheless, he persisted with trying to achieve fluency in language through conscious practice. While studying physics at the University of Utah, Brown studied Japanese with drills and practice of speeches, but found that "[n]ot a single sentence was ever triggered by a thought." He described hitting "rock bottom" after teaching a Japanese class to use the same method he had used and learning from the students' reviews that "they all hated [him] and [his] practice."
Brown experienced a "sudden conversion" upon reading a copy of "The Natural Approach" by Stephen Krashen and Tracy Terrell that his colleague Adrian S. Palmer gave him the next day. "In 1983, I first came across Krashen's idea that we acquire languages by understanding messages, and in no other way," recalled Brown. "The thing that caught my attention was 'and in no other way.' I was pretty well sold on understanding happenings, but now I could consider ruling out everything else. No memorizing, no practicing, no speaking!"
In 1984, Brown began teaching language using a comprehension approach of listening to comprehensible input, starting with the following semester's Japanese class, then a natural approach Thai class. He returned to Bangkok to give a demonstration term of natural approach Thai to students and observers funded by the United States Information Agency, and was hired by AUA to give natural approach classes along with the regular structural approach classes.
From the start, Brown's version of the natural approach at AUA differed from that of Krashen and Terrell in significant ways. There was no speaking practice on the part of students, in accordance with Krashen's input hypothesis that "speaking ability emerges on its own after enough competence has been developed by listening and understanding". "We're trying to find out what will happen if we hold strictly to this part of Krashen's theory," Brown and Palmer wrote in 1988 in "The Listening Approach", naming the book after what they called the approach at that time. Therefore, Brown extended to hundreds of hours the silent period where students were not to speak until they could produce language spontaneously, without conscious effort.
Brown's approach also had two teachers speaking to one another in front of the class, which allowed students to observe interaction in the target language without speaking it themselves. "[S]tudents watched two or three Thais act out easy-to-understand scenarios describing Thai customs." wrote author Cleo Odzer of the natural approach Thai classes at AUA in the late 1980s.
According to Brown, students who adhered to the long silent period by first listening to Thai for hundreds of hours without trying to speak were able to surpass the level of fluency he had achieved after several decades in Thailand within just a few years, without study or practice, while other students who tried to speak from the beginning found themselves "struggling with broken Thai like all long-time foreigners." In Brown's view, trying to speak the language before developing a clear mental image through listening had permanently damaged their ability to produce the language like a native speaker.
Brown also reported that students who refrained from speaking but still asked questions about the language, took notes, or looked up words all failed to surpass his level of ability, and some of those who refrained from speaking and all these things still failed to surpass him. In order to experience his version of the natural approach for himself, Brown attempted to learn the Shantou dialect of Chinese by setting up classes with the same format of the AUA natural approach Thai classes. He found that as a linguist he was unable to stop himself from analyzing the language he was hearing, and said this interfered with developing the ability to use the language like a native speaker.
From his experience and observations Brown concluded that, contrary to the critical period hypothesis for second language acquisition, where adults have lost the ability that children have to learn languages to a native-like level without apparent effort, adults actually obstruct this ability when learning a new language through using abilities they have gained to consciously practice and think about language.
Later life.
Brown retired from AUA in 1995 and returned to the United States. He died on August 29, 2002 at the age of 77.
Brown wrote an autobiography, "From the Outside In", detailing his life as a linguist and the development of ALG. This was published posthumously on the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), an online library sponsored by the Institute of Education Sciences of the United States Department of Education. A longer version was subsequently published on the ALG World website with chapters on Brown's theories about physics, the brain, and other topics.
Languages.
"I’ve been trying to learn languages and teach them all my life," Brown wrote in the preface of his autobiography. "I spent the war trying to learn [Mandarin] Chinese, and I spent the next 50 years trying to learn 20 more languages and trying to teach two."
Brown studied Latin in high school and French, Spanish, and Italian in the late 1940s at the University of Utah. He both studied and taught Thai and Burmese at Cornell. He had also studied German and Indonesian. When he taught Thai and English at AUA using his structural approach, he studied Vietnamese to remind him how it felt for students who were beginners at Thai. Returning to the University of Utah in the early 1980s, he studied Japanese and again studied Mandarin. In the 1990s he attempted to learn the Shantou dialect of Chinese by setting up classes that were like his AUA natural approach Thai classes.
According to Brown, while his ability in Thai was reputed as "legendary" and he could be mistaken for a native speaker over the phone, unlike his native English, he had to consciously monitor his production to speak Thai correctly. "When I speak Thai, I think in Thai," he wrote. "When I speak English, I think only in thought—I pay no attention to English." Brown claimed that, in contrast, the ALG approach of implicit learning without study or practice can produce adults who fluently speak a second language like a native speaker without conscious attention to language.

Early life.
Tim Hwang was born on February 20, 1992 in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of immigrants from South Korea. His family later moved to Potomac, Maryland, where he was elected as the student member of the Montgomery County Board Of Education and graduated from Thomas S. Wootton High School in 2010.
At the age of 14, he founded Operation Fly after a church missions trip to Guatemala.
Hwang attended the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, where he was also active in helping to found the National Youth Association (now defunct), a national youth lobby organization". He then was admitted to Harvard Business School.
Business career.
In the Spring of 2013, as Hwang was finishing his degree at Princeton, he launched FiscalNote along with two friends from high school, Gerald Yao and Jonathan Chen. Hwang deferred his attendance at Harvard Business School to start the company while Yao took a leave of absence from Emory University. At the time, FiscalNote began its service as a state legislative tracking service. Hwang, Yao, and Chen, bootstrapped the business with several thousand dollars and incorporated FiscalNote in June 2013.
FiscalNote soon moved the company to Washington, DC and raised several rounds of venture capital. The firm has grown to become one of the largest software employers in the District of Columbia. In 2017, Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a major job training program and economic development package alongside Hwang, pioneering a new model for technology development in the city. Hwang was the protagonist of a Columbia Business School case study in Fall 2015, a 2016-hour-long Korean Broadcasting System Documentary (Empathy: Tim Hwang at the Center of Korea's Attention), and a South Korean biography "24 Year Old Tim Hwang: The CEO that the World is Paying Attention To." Hwang has been widely criticized for making critical comments in the South Korean media about the health of the Korean economy, stating that "the Korean economy is like a patient with crutches."
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hwang fired 30 staff from the CQ Roll Call newsroom, with one source telling AdWeek that the layoffs included the entire team of investigative reporters, and all but one staff member from the print magazine team. A month earlier, Hwang had told a reporter with Washington Business Journal that Roll Call was "on track to bring in $100 million in 2020 revenue and turn a profit.”
Philanthropy.
Hwang is a Trustee on the Board of the Community Foundation of the National Capital Region, a member of the Board of the Afterschool Alliance, a member of The Economic Club of Washington, D.C. and the Young Presidents Organization.

The Refrigerator Monologues

The Refrigerator Monologues is a 2017 superhero fiction novel by Catherynne Valente, with art by Annie Wu, exploring the lives - and deaths - of superheroines, and of the girlfriends of superheroes; the title refers to "Women in Refrigerators", and to "The Vagina Monologues". It was published by Saga Press.
Synopsis.
In a corner of the afterlife, six women meet on a regular basis to commiserate and share their stories. They have all been involved in the world of superheroes and suffered because of it, facing various forms of sexism from heroes and villains alike. Their afterlife, Deadtown, is a mix between a pleasant bohemian neighborhood and a forbidding necropolis. It is populated by a race of friendly, cultured gargoyles who do their best to take care of the ghosts. People frequently leave Deadtown (either willingly or unwillingly) due to the unreliable nature of comic book deaths. They enjoy extinct food and forgotten culture, sharing their stories in order to pass the time. Everyone in Deadtown is forced to wear the clothes they were buried in, even if those clothes say nothing about their real natures.
Each woman is a parody of a famous character from the mainstream Marvel or DC universe, retelling their famous storylines from a new, feminist perspective. Their group is known as the Hell Hath Club, with Paige Embry (an alternate version of Gwen Stacy) serving as the primary keeper of their stories and the group's unofficial leader. She also provides connecting narration for each of the stories. The novella examines the double standards of superheroics, along with the "Women in Refrigerators" practice of killing or torturing female characters in order to assist male character development. The characters consider themselves "released" from the dark and painful world of superhero storylines, ending the book with a punk rock celebration. 
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" called it "dazzling", "brilliantly furious", and "a rage-filled pleasure", and noted that "no comic book expertise is required" — although the "Portland Press-Herald" felt that it "depends a great deal on an insider’s knowledge of comic book lore for maximum enjoyment".
"Den of Geek" described it as "cathartically angry", and commended the "vivid, specific voice" of each character. "Vox" stated that it was "bitingly sarcastic and wistfully regretful, and always ferociously angry". "Kirkus Reviews" judged it to be "entertaining but not a romp", and "ruthless but absorbing and provocative", while "the Washington Post" considered it to be "entertaining but heavy-handed".
Origins.
Valente was inspired to write the book as a result of her anger at the death of Gwen Stacy in the 2014 film "The Amazing Spider-Man 2".
Adaptation.
In December 2018, Amazon Studios announced that Shauna Cross was developing a pilot episode for an adaptation of "The Refrigerator Monologues", to be titled "Deadtown".

John Wright (shipbuilder-sawmiller)

John Wright was a 19th-century Australian shipbuilder, sawmiller and businessman.
Biography.
In 1875, John Wright was the first white settler in Tuncurry, Australia. Born in Scotland, he arrived in Australia on "Lord Worsley" in May 1860. John Wright and Son Shipyards was a successful business until 1958.
Wright adopted the local Worimi Aboriginal place name "Tuncurry" for the area north of Forster, which is said to mean "plenty fish". The Worimi people called John Wright "big boss" and "first fella". Before settling in Tuncurry, Wright sold his share of a sawmilling and shipwright business with Alexander Croll at Bungwahl on the Myall Lakes.
Wright's son Ernest was the first white child born in Tuncurry. Ernest successfully continued the shipbuilding business after John's death. Another son, Sidney Garden Wright managed a large sawmill known as Avalon Mill near Krambach. Sidney married a granddaughter of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. They had ten children in the Mid North Coast area near Tuncurry.
The water front land where the mill and shipyard stood at Tuncurry was gazetted as an area for public recreation and in 1962 was renamed John Wright Park.

The Robert S. Vessey House, on College Avenue in Wessington Springs, South Dakota, was built in 1906. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
It is a two-story Dutch Colonial-style house, with three dormers above its front porch, built on a somewhat terraced corner lot.
It was home of Robert S. Vessey, who became governor of the state. The house was deemed significant in architecture and government: "Architecturally its Swedish-Dutch Colonial appearance makes it one of the better examples of every twentieth century architecture in Wessington Springs. Politically the structure is important for it housed Vessey when he was elected governor in 1908."

Eliezer Gruenbaum

Eliezer Grynbaum or Eliezer Gruenbaum (27 November 1908 – 22 May 1948) was a Polish Jewish communist activist. During World War II, he was a kapo in the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, he wrote memoirs about his experiences.
Biography.
Eliezer Gruenbaum was born in Warsaw in 1908, the second son of a prominent Polish-Jewish politician Yitzhak Gruenbaum. With his father's help, Eliezer arrived in Mandatory Palestine in 1946, where he started writing memoirs. He was however subject to "attacks by right-wing and religious groups eager, among other things, to discredit his father." Due to his past, the Haganah refused to draft him, however following a plea from his father to David Ben-Gurion he was enlisted. He was killed in 1948 Arab–Israeli War during the Battle of Ramat Rachel on 22 May 1948. After his death rumors spread that he committed suicide or might have been murdered in revenge for his kapo past.
Political activism.
At age of 16, he joined the Communist Party of Poland, and in 1929 was imprisoned by Polish authorities for four and half years for his communism-related activism (the Communist Party was at that time delegalized in Poland). He escaped or was released early from prison (after serving two or two and a half years, sources vary) and then moved to Paris, where he was an editor of a Polish worker's newsletter. He fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, and after returning to France, was once again arrested, this time by the French authorities, on charges of sedition (here, the accounts vary again, according to another source, he was arrested in Spain, but escaped safely back to France). After the German invasion of France, he volunteered for the French Army, eventually joining the Polish Army in France, and later joined the French Resistance.
Deportation to Auschwitz.
In 1942 he was arrested (as a communist, not as a Jew) and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. In Auschwitz, he became a kapo, a title given to prisoners supervising forced labor or carrying out administrative tasks. He survived the camp, and after the war he was accused of collaboration with Nazi Germany, and of "mercilessly beating inmates". He was also accused of murdering "tens of thousands of Jewish prisoners". He defended himself claiming that he only accepted the position at the request of other Jews, who wanted one of their own in the position, which was otherwise often filled by anti-Semitic non-Jewish people, including German criminals. Research based on analysis of his memoirs, however, concluded that he became a kapo due to "intervention by communists". At the end of 1943 Gruenbaum was moved from the concentration camps to work in coal mines in Jawiszowice, and finally ended in the Buchenwald concentration camp. After the war, in 1945, he was tried by a communist tribunal on charges of participating in violent beatings, but was shortly acquitted. He resumed his political activities, advocating for the communist takeover of Poland, but he was soon arrested again, in France, accused by fellow Jews of having been the “head of the Birkenau death camp.” In a trial that lasted eight months, he was acquitted again, because the French court concluded that "neither the accused nor the victims were French". As noted by Galia Glasner-Heled and Dan Bar-On, "Eliezer Gruenbaum was never formally convicted, but nor was he actually acquitted of these accusations". He was not welcomed in France, nor in Poland, where the communist party expelled him from its ranks.
Published works.
His memoirs has been called "an extraordinary piece of testimony", since it is the only document of its type written by a concentration camp kapo. They were partially published in 1952 in the "Scrolls of Fire" album, and their inclusion in this memorial book is attributed to his father's political pressure (at that time he was Israel's Minister of the Interior). The excerpt published in the "Scrolls"... album is titled "'In the Courtyards of Death"'.

2010 Orange County, Florida mayoral election

The 2010 Orange County, Florida mayoral election took place on November 2, 2010. Incumbent Republican Mayor Richard Crotty was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, and four candidates ran to replace him. A nonpartisan primary election was held on August 24, 2010, but because no candidate won a majority of the vote, former County Commissioner Teresa Jacobs, a Republican, advanced to a runoff election against fellow County Commissioner Bill Segal, a Democrat. Following a contentious general election, Jacobs was elected Mayor over Segal in a landslide, winning her first term 68-32.
Primary election.
Campaign.
The race to succeed term-limited Mayor Richard Crotty, a Republican, initially included incumbent County Commissioners Mildred Fernández, Bill Segal, and Linda Stewart, former County Commissioner Teresa Jacobs, and businessman Matthew Falconer. Though officially nonpartisan, Segal and Stewart were Democrats, while Falconer, Fernández, and Jacobs were Republicans.
Segal started off as the frontrunner, raising vastly more money than his opponents combined, benefiting from independent expenditures from a business-affiliated campaign group, and winning support from much of the county's political establishment. He emphasized his business experience and campaigned on a plan to create jobs by providing employment incentives to businesses. Segal was criticized by his opponents, however, for his pro-development policies. He also came under scrutiny for attending private, men-only meetings with lobbyists and developers, and for voting for county projects that benefited his business partner financially. Segal, however, compared the meetings to other routine events that he regularly attended, and said that he "never made a dime" on his votes.
Though Stewart raised little money, she launched an "aggressive" and "progressive campaign," focusing on her support for environmental causes, improving public transportation, LGBT rights, and ethics reform. She campaigned on her strong support for SunRail and other transportation projects, which she would've funded through a rental car surcharge and a half-cent sales tax increase, though she called for rolling back a 25-cent toll increase. Stewart was criticized for supporting tax increases and her inability to run the county, with Segal arguing that she didn't have the "savvy," "worldliness," or the "management ability" to lead the county.
Falconer, meanwhile, positioned himself as the Tea Party candidate, and campaigned on his support for slashing the size of county government and his opposition to infrastructure projects like SunRail.
Fernández campaigned on a fiscally conservative platform, arguing for tax cuts, a reduction in the size of government, and strong ethics reform. However, on April 27, 2010, following an undercover sting she was arrested on charges of "bribery, grand theft, and accepting illegal campaign contributions." Segal's campaign manager, Eric Foglesong, had spoken with State Attorney Lawson Lamar's office about Fernández, and was listed as a "confidential source" in court records. Fernández claimed that "special interests" had conspired to launch a "brutal character assassination" against her, and her lawyer accused Segal of coordinating the arrest. Fernández dropped out of the race and was suspended as County Commissioner by then-Governor Charlie Crist, and she would later resign on November 15, 2011, as part of a plea deal.
Finally, Jacobs focused on ending the "good ol' boy network" that she said had long run Orange County and scared off businesses looking to relocate to the region. She emphasized her support for ethics reform and said that she would build the Wekiva Parkway by "renegotiat[ing] bond deals, reprioritiz[ing] current road projects, and look[ing] for private partners to complete the project."
Though it did not make an endorsement in the race, the Florida Democratic Party campaigned against Jacobs, attacking her for being a "lobbyist" and for "spen[ding] her career working against us for special interests" and linked her to former President George W. Bush and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Jacobs argued that the Party repeated Segal's "false accusations," and that she had "never been a lobbyist."
The "Orlando Sentinel" endorsed Jacobs, praising her as "[c]reative and courageous, with a budget director's mind and an environmentalist's heart." The "Sentinel" criticized Segal for his disregard for unbridled development and lack of transparency, and noted that if he won, Falconer would be a "detriment to the county and the region" and would make Orange County "a bleak place." Though it praised Stewart's positions, the "Sentinel" argued that "Jacobs would champion them more forcefully," and that Stewart was "more advocate than administrator."
General election.
Campaign.
Despite Bill Segal's frontrunner status and expectations that he would finish first in the primary, he finished a distant second, only narrowly edging out Linda Stewart.
As Jacobs and Segal advanced to the general election, the rhetoric between both campaigns became heated. Segal attacked Jacobs on ethics, for not supporting gay rights, and for making it "more difficult for minority-owned businesses to get access to county contracts." Jacobs countered that she supported an effort to expand the county's human rights ordinance, and that Segal "fought and ignored" financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules as County Commissioner. On racial issues, Jacobs argued that Segal misrepresented her record and pointed to her work improving quality of life in Tildenville, a small African-American community.
And despite Segal's earlier fundraising advantage over Jacobs, as the general election approached, Jacobs took a fundraising lead over Segal, and released polls showing that she maintained a sizable edge over him.
Meanwhile, Stewart refused to endorse Segal, a fellow Democrat, over Jacobs, a Republican, criticizing their "stark differences on the environment and growth policies." Stewart attacked Segal's environmental record, his pushes to "put urban development into rural settlements," and his "extremely poor judgment in attending lavish 'men-only' cocktail parties funded by lobbyists." However, she declined to endorse Jacobs, either, noting that she had "areas of disagreement" with her.

Châu controlled 4 VC Battalions and approximately 6 district companies. The area had seen little combat due to its small population, low rainfall and limited rice production.
Operation.
On 25 August 1966 the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, equipped with 38 UH-1 helicopters, plus a battery each of 105-mm. and 155-mm. howitzers was deployed to Firebase Betty south of Phan Thiết the capital of Bình Thuận Province for a search and destroy operation that was expected to last 2 months. At the conclusion of this phase the VC had lost over 250 dead for minimal Allied losses.
Following the conclusion of that operation, I Field Force commander LTG William B. Rosson decided to keep Task Force Byrd in place to provide a mobile strike force to support ARVN forces in the area, particularly the 44th Regiment commanded by the Province chief Lt. Col. Nguyen Khac Tuan.
On the evening of 16 October units of the VC 482nd Battalion attacked the Thien Giao district headquarters 18km north of Phan Thiết, penetrating the perimeter and destroying three of four bunkers before being driven off by 1st Cavalry Division helicopter gunships.
The 2/7th Cavalry and ARVN units conducted combined operations throughout late 1966 and into 1967, gradually improving security in the province but seldom encountering large VC units. By late October 1967 the operation had accounted for over 850 VC killed and 300 weapons captured for losses of 23 killed and 278 wounded.
In late 1967 COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland sought to reopen and improve Highway 1 from Xuân Lộc to Phan Rang, restoring the overland link between III Corps and II Corps. Task Force Byrd was to provide security to military engineers as they repaired and improved Highway 1 across Bình Thuận Province. The engineers would also construct platoon-size bases along the highway to provide security for the highway itself and to support pacification efforts.
On 8 November 1967 the VC 840th Battalion and the 450th Local Force Company attacked the under construction Fort Mara (), 15km northeast of Phan Thiết which contained the headquarters and an infantry company from the ARVN 3rd Battalion, 44th Regiment. The unit's U.S. adviser called for support and the commander of Task Force Byrd, Lt. Col. Joseph T. Griffin Jr., sent a 3 UH–1 "Night Hunter" team, with the first helicopter carrying infantrymen equipped with Starlight scope rifles flying low to the ground, the second helicopter dropped flares from a higher altitude and the third helicopter was armed with aerial rockets to return any hostile fire. An AC-47 "Spooky" gunship also arrived to assist the defenders and together they succeeded in holding back the VC until dawn when a company from the 2/7th Cavalry arrived forcing the VC to withdraw. ARVN losses were 28 killed and 35 wounded, while VC losses were 42 killed.
On 22 November the VC launched a mortar attack on an ARVN outpost at Thien Giao. Lt. Col. Griffin sent an infantry platoon to engage the VC. When the helicopters landed in a clearing near the outpost, they were met by small arms and machine gun fire from the VC 482nd Battalion which had planned to ambush such an air assault. Lt. Col. Griffin sent the rest of the 2/7th Cavalry to relieve the stranded platoon and these helicopters were also met by intense fire around the landing zone with 2 forced to crash-land. After several hours the 482nd Battalion disengaged from combat. U.S. losses were 11 dead and 36 wounded, while VC losses were estimated as 21 killed.
Aftermath.
Operation Byrd was suspended on 1 December 1967 and the 2/7th Cavalry join the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, in Operation Klamath Falls along the border between Bình Thuận and Lâm Đồng Provinces. Operation Byrd was succeeded by Operation McLain conducted by the 3rd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment.

She hit Supernova Elite on PokerStars in 2011, 2012 and 2013. This required her to play approximately 2.5 million hands per year. She focused her online games at the $1/$2 to $2/$4 stakes. She calls herself the "Ultimate Grinder" for the volume of hands she plays online. In 2013, she won the $1,000 Ladies No Limit Hold'em Championship at the 2013 World Series of Poker earning $173,922.
In 2016, Bicknell won the $1,500 No-Limit hold'em bounty event and earned $290,768. That same year she signed with partypoker.

Marcus Annius Afrinus

Marcus Annius Afrinus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the emperor's service. He was suffect consul in July-August 66 with Gaius Paccius Africanus as his colleague. He is known primarily from inscriptions.
Bernard Remy states that nothing is known of his origins, but notes C. Castillo suggests Afrinus may have come from Hispania Baetica. The "cursus honorum" of Afrinus is imperfectly known. His first attested office was governor of the imperial province of Galatia from around the year 49 to 54; he is surmised to have been a popular governor, for his name and portrait appear on the coinage of Claudiconium. For reasons unknown, his advancement to the consulate was much delayed; according to the "Lex annales", for non-patricians the gap between praetor and consul was 12 years, while it took Afrinus at least 17 years to advance to the consulate.
We know of only one office from the consular portion of his "cursus". Afrinus was governor of the imperial province of Pannonia, immediately succeeding Lucius Tampius Flavianus in late 69, until the year 73. His life afterwards is a blank.

Tayuan Temple

Tayuan Temple is located in the central area of Taihuai town in Mount Wutai, Shanxi Province, China. Tayuan Temple was originally a stupa of Xiantong Temple. The stupa, named the Great White Pagoda, was constructed in the 6th year of of the Yuan dynasty (1302 AD). In the 5th year of Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty (1407AD), it was expanded to a temple and got its name as Tayuan Temple. It is listed in the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected in Shanxi Province, China.
About.
It is one of the five famous temples for practicing Zen, and also one of the ten famous temples for accommodating monks in Mount Wutai. Tayuan Temple stands in the north facing the south, consisting of rows of temple buildings and dorms for monks. Its axis is filled with magnificent structures such as screen walls, stone tablets, arches, stone stairways, passing doors, gates, drum towers, Tianwang Hall, Daci Yanshou Hall, Cangjing Mansion, Shanhai Mansion, Manjushri Hair Pagoda, and so on. It has an area of 15,000 square meters with over 130 halls and houses.
Currently, there are three exquisite wooden-arch structures that were built during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty. Shakyamuni Buddha Hall stands in front of the temple, Cangjing Mansion (library for sutras) in its back and the Great White Pagoda (Sharira Pagoda) in its middle. The statues in the halls are all well-preserved. There are 20 layers of wooden rotating wheels in the Cangjing Mansion, each of which is placed with over 20,000 Buddhism sutras in Chinese, Mongolian and Tibetan characters. Among them, there are over 2,000 complete and widely-read sutras that were written between the Song Dynasty to the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty.
The Great White Pagoda is the main building in the temple. It is a Tibetan-style pagoda sits on a rectangle base. It is 75.3 m tall, constructed of brick with a lime coating on the outside that gives its white color, towering amongst the mountains and trees and standing out with its white pagoda. The tower spires, trays and pearls are all made of bronze. Wind-bells are decorated in the middle of the pagoda and the trays. When the bells all dance to the blowing wind, you will find the pagoda is so charming and enticing. To the east of the Great White Pagoda stands a smaller white pagoda. Legend has it that inside the pagoda stores the golden hairs of Manjushri Bodhisattva when He presents himself to the people on earth. Therefore, the smaller white pagoda is also called “Manjushri Hair Pagoda.”
In 1983 it has been designated as a "National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area". Today, people recognize this pagoda as a symbol of Mount Wutai. The Tayuan Temple has significant importance in China.

Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan

Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan (born 3 December 1986) is an Indian lawyer and Dalit-Bahujan rights activist. He is an Ambedkarite who is the co-founder and national president of the Bhim Army. In February 2021, "Time" magazine featured him in its annual list of "100 emerging leaders who are shaping the future".
Early life.
Chandrashekhar Azad (Ravan) was born in December 1986 at Chhutmalpur town in Saharanpur district, Uttar Pradesh to Govardhan Das &amp; Kamlesh Devi. His father Govardhan Das was a retired principal of a government school. Azad came to prominence as a Bahujan leader after a hoarding which said "The Great Chamars of Ghadkhauli Welcome You" was installed by him on the outskirts of his village.
Activism.
Azad has established himself as Dalit icon and he is known for his style. "Azad does something more: his style is ostentatious. It rejects docility, mimimalism and discretion. It is not quietly elegant, but emphatically flamboyant. It flaunts Raybans alongside homespun, replaces hipster beards with the twirled 'tache. It is azadi with swag."
Hathras rape case.
Azad and his supporters held a protest at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, where a 19-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras died days after being gang raped, demanding the culprits be sentenced to death. The Dalit woman from the marginalised Valmiki community succumbed to her injuries. He had earlier gone to see the woman, when she was still alive and demanded she be shifted to AIIMS. But she was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University's Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital and shifted to Safdarjung Hospital later where she succumbed.
He held a massive protest on Sunday after he was stopped twice by the UP Police when he was on his way to meet the victim's family. Visuals showed him standing on a truck, addressing a huge crowd. When he was stopped for the first time, about 20 km from Hathras, he marched for around 5 km, along with his supporters, to cover the distance to reach the victim's home. A video showed them carrying flags and raising slogans against the government.
As he met the family on Sunday evening, he demanded "Y+" category security for them. He also urged the administration to let him take the victim's family along with him; the request, however, was turned down. He joined a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar where hundreds of people came with placards and shouted slogans against the incident, which has sparked massive outrage.
The body of the gang rape victim was burnt with petrol in Hathras in the middle of the night by the police, with her family members alleging that the local police did not give them a chance to do the last rites. This happened when Azad was detained by Uttar Pradesh police midway and then been put under house arrest in Saharanpur.
Farm bills.
Azad joined the protesting farmers at the Delhi-Ghazipur border along with hundreds of his supporters and demanded that the new farm laws be withdrawn immediately. Before that, he was detained at his residence in Uttar Pradesh before he joined the nationwide farmers' protest. He also criticised the centre for using water cannons and tear gas against the demonstrators. He alleged the government wants to grab the farmers' land and give it to industrialists.
Political career.
Azad, Satish Kumar, and Vinay Ratan Singh founded Bhim Army in 2014, an organization that works for the emancipation of Dalits through education in India. It runs free schools for Dalits in the Western Uttar Pradesh. In 2019, he originally planned to contest from Varanasi against Modi, but later withdrew his offer to support the SP/BSP combine and prevent the splitting of the Dalit vote in the constituency.
2020 Bihar Assembly elections.
Azad started his career as leader of Bhim Army which is an organisation based in Uttar Pradesh but he later formed Azad Samaj Party to participate in electoral politics. The party allied with Pappu Yadav led Jan Adhikar Party in 2020 Bihar Assembly elections to form a separate front apart from National Democratic Alliance and United Progressive Alliance.
In the elections it contested against these two grand alliances besides another front called Grand Democratic Secular Front, which was spearheaded by Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and contained other regional parties like All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and Suhaldev Samaj Party among others. The front led by Pappu Yadav and Azad was named as Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA).
Azad Samaj Party.
Azad Samaj Party (Kanshiram) is an Indian political party formally launched on 15 March 2020 by Ravan. It is significant that the announcement was made on the 86th birth anniversary of Kashi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party. The sister of the founder of that party, Sarwan Kaur, planned to join the Azad Samaj party. The party planned to contest every seat in Bihar in the 2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. Bhim Army founder Chandrashekar Azad Ravan announced to join the Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) led by Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) of Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav with other regional political parties to contest the Bihar assembly election 2020. Much of the party's popularity comes from the Dalit and Scheduled tribes.

F-box protein 15

F-box protein 15 also known as Fbx15 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FBXO15 gene.
Function.
Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO15, are characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by SKP1, cullin, and F-box proteins, act as protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other protein interaction domains.
Biochemically, Fbx15 is a substrate receptor of an ubiquitin ligase belonging to the family of the F-box proteins. Differently from other F-box proteins, Fbx15 recognizes its substrate Kif1-Binding Protein (KBP) in an acetylation dependent manner.
Importance in embryonic stem cells.
Fbxo15 is a protein expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
It is expressed during coexpression of Oct3/4, c-Myc, Klf4, and SOX2, four genes identified to be important in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation repression.
In mice having a beta-galactosidase gene knocked into the Fbx15 locus, stain was detected in ES cells, early embryos (from two-cell to blastocyst stages), and testis tissue.
There is an enhancer site upstream of the Fbx15-encoding transcription gene that contains an octamer-like binding motif and a Sox-like binding motif. Reporter gene analyses demonstrated that the ES cell-specific expression required this 18-bp enhancer element located approximately 500 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site. Deletion or point mutation of either motif abolished the enhancer activity. It became active in NIH 3T3 cells when Oct3/4 and Sox2 were coexpressed and cooperatively bind to the enhancer sequence.
Targeted deletion of the "Fbx15" gene in mice does not result in embryonic lethality or gross developmental aberrations, despite the fact that "Fbx15-/-" mice are sub-fertile when compared to their wild-type counterparts. This might be explained by the fact that "Fbx15-/-" embryonic stem cells display a proliferation defect - caused by the accumulation of the Fbx15 substrate KBP - generating a short-term bottleneck during the early stages of embryogenesis. In fact, targeting of KBP is required to prevent an unscheduled mitochondrial biogenesis that, in naïve pluripotent stem cells, causes increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and production of reactive oxygen species.
The selective expression of Fbx15 and its dependency on the activity of the pluripotency core factors Oct3/4 and Sox2 promoted the use of the expression of Fbx15 as the first marker of reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells.

Coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod

The coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod is the official symbol of the city from December 20, 2006.
Description.
For the basis of the coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod, the historical coat of arms of August 16, 1781 was taken.
The coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod is an image of a deer on the French heraldic shield framed with the ribbon of the Order of Lenin.
Heraldic description: "On the silver (white) shield a walking red deer is depicted. Horns, eyes and hoofs are black. The shield is crowned with a golden crown tower with five prongs with a golden laurel wreath. Framed on the sides with ribbon of the Order of Lenin".
Symbolic color values:
History.
The history of the emblem of the coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod is controversial. Some historians believe that in the 16th and 17th centuries the elk was depicted on the coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod, and in the 18th century, the King-of-Arms turned it into a deer. In the decree of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich on the production of the stamp of arms from 1666 it was written: "The seal of the Nizhny Novgorod, on it the elk is coming". Other scientists believe that already in the 17th century, a deer was depicted on the coat of arms. They refer to the "Tsarskiy titulyarnik", compiled in the Posolsky Prikaz, after the great Moscow fire of 1626. It read: "Seal of Nizhny Novgorod: deer, under the deer is a land."
The first version of the city's coat of arms was approved on August 16, 1781 by Catherine the Great:
It is noted that "the city of Nizhny has an old coat of arms."
Vladimir Gilyarovsky wrote that barge haulers, for whom the Nizhny Novgorod coat of arms was a symbol of rest and fun, called him "a cheerful goat".
During the Soviet era, the city's coat of arms was not used. However, the GAZ logo was often used, on which a deer was depicted. Most often, a white or gold running deer was depicted on a red background - a symbol of the Soviet Union.
In 1992, the coat of arms was restored. The new city coat of arms was different from the historical one. The shield was surrounded by golden oak leaves, girded with a ribbon of flowers of the national flag of Russia. This version of the coat of arms caused criticism from specialists in heraldry and design. It was pointed out that this variant did not meet the heraldic norms.
The need to change the coat of arms and the flag of Nizhny Novgorod arose after in 2005 the Heraldic Council of the President of Russia decided that the coats of arms of all the administrative centers of the country should have an image of the crown. Under the new rules, the colors of the state flag of the country should not have been present in municipal emblems. The new coat of arms was approved on December 20, 2006.

Future Forward Party

The Future Forward Party (FFP) (, , ; literally 'New Future Party') was a political party in Thailand founded in March 2018 by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, former vice president of Thai Summit Group, and Piyabutr Saengkanokkul, a legal scholar. It was founded on a progressive platform that sought to restrain the military's power in Thai politics, decentralize the bureaucracy, and improve social and economic equality. The party was dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 21 February 2020.
History.
In September 2018, the Future Forward Party was officially recognized by the Election Commission, allowing the party to start registering members and solicit funding.
In the 2019 election, the party won 30 constituency seats in parliament and 50 party-list MPs, including Thanathorn and Piyabutr, a result significantly better than had been expected for a new party. It also later gained an additional seat from a by-election in Chiang Mai, giving it a total of 81 seats.
Following the election, the party faced various legal challenges, which party leader Thanathorn says are politically motivated. Thanathorn was accused of violating election law by the Election Commission, resulting in the Constitutional Court temporarily suspending his MP status until a ruling was reached. Despite this, FFP and six allied anti-junta parties nominated Thanathorn as a candidate for prime minister, but lost to incumbent prime minister and junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha. Thanathorn was ultimately disqualified by the Constitutional Court. One prominent case against the party, which the Constitutional Court accepted in July 2019, alleged that FFP sought to overthrow the monarchy. As evidence, the resemblance between the party's triangular symbol and that of the Illuminati was cited. The case was dismissed in January 2020.
On 16 December 2019, the party's executives and MPs voted to expel four MPs who had consistently voted against the party line, reducing its total to 76 MPs.
The party was dissolved in a Constitutional Court ruling on 21 February 2020, which said that the party was in violation of election laws regarding donations to political parties. The party was loaned 191.2 million baht (about US$6 million) from its leader, Thanathorn, which, according to the court, counted as a donation. The dissolution order drew criticism from commentators inside and outside the country, who characterized it as part of the military's continued interference in Thai politics, noting that the party's vocal anti-military position made it a target and that the other parties' finances were not similarly scrutinized.
The future of Future Forward.
Prior to the court ruling that disbanded his party, Thanathorn disclosed in an interview that, in the event of the party's dissolution, "...we will continue our political journey as a social movement, we'll build a new one outside the parliament. If they dissolve our party, there will be two paths running in parallel—one is a new party in parliament, running under a new name but the same ideology, and the second is a social movement..." The court decision meant that the 65 remaining Future Forward MPs had to find a new party within 60 days. Ten list seats held by now-banned party executives will also have to be reallocated. It is not clear whether the Election Commission will allow candidates on the FFP party list to replace those ten. Competing parties were expected to woo the displaced Future Forward MPs, but the FFP stated that a new party would be ready to accommodate those who wanted to continue its work. A few days after the dissolution, nine MPs defected from the party to join the Bhumjaithai Party in the government coalition. On 8 March 2020, 55 of the remaining 56 MPs announced their relocation to the Move Forward Party under Pita Limjaroenrat, vowing to continue the work of Future Forward. The remaining member joined the Chartthaipattana Party. The extra-parliamentary successor of the FFP, the Progressive Movement, has been announced by former party leader Thanathorn, with an agenda of pushing for further reforms and amending the constitution.
The Election Commission is likely to hear criminal charges against the FFP's leadership, which could result in three to five years imprisonment.
Party leadership.
Future Forward's executive committees were elected in a vote during the party's first official meeting in May 2018.

Robert Sexé

Robert Sexé (17 November 1890–1986) was a French reporter, motorcyclist, photographer and globetrotter. His travels around the world are considered to be an inspiration for the comic character Tintin. He was a reporter for "La Moto", "La Revue de Automobile", and "Le Petit Parisien".
Early life.
Robert Sexé was born in La Roche-sur-Yon, in Western France. He was raised by his father's brother as he was orphaned at a very young age. He studied at French-based Jesuit College of St. Joseph and received a Bachelor of Letters in 1907. He then moved to London to study at the London School of Economics, where he read Economics. He purchased his first motorcycle in 1912. The short-lived newspaper "The Daily Citizen" hired Sexé to be a special correspondent for the Balkan Wars. Sexé was a reporter during World War I.
Around-the-world trips.
He made several trips across the world including travelling the Soviet Union in 1926 on a motorcycle. He also visited the Belgian Congo and the United States. His exploits and photographs were printed in many newspapers across France and Belgium. He received notable press attention when he would visit a country including Russia, Japan, and the United States.
In 1926, Sexé, along with Henri Andrieux, travelled around the world with their Belgian built Gillet Herstal motorcycles. They left Paris on 14 June and ended their trip in Brussels on 3 December. They received cooperation from the Soviet government in their travels in the USSR, with fuel being placed in convenient areas for them to refill their bikes.
Tintin.
Sexé's travels, use of motorcycles, and his similar appearance were all mirrored in Tintin's first two adventures. Herge, the creator of Tintin, started drawing the character in 1929 setting his first adventure in the Soviet Union. "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets", came almost three years after Sexé travelled the country. Sexé's photos of his travels in the country were printed in Belgian newspapers, where Herge resided. According to the BBC documentary "Tintin's Adventure with Frank Gardner", some of the photos that Sexé took match what Herge would later draw, replacing Sexé with Tintin. Tintin was even depicted riding the same model motorcycle, the Belgian-made Gillet Herstal, that Sexé rode across the Soviet Union. The Hergé Foundation in Belgium has admitted that it is not too hard to imagine how Hergé could have been influenced by the exploits of Sexé. The creator of Tintin never revealed who inspired his characters.
Later life.
During World War II, Sexé wrote articles for "La Gerbe", a French collaborationist weekly newspaper that promoted Vichy or Nazi beliefs.
Sexé died in 1986 in Poitiers, France.

Bavarian Forest Nature Park

The Bavarian Forest Nature Park () covers an area north of the Danube as far as the border ridge with the Czech Republic. Its sponsor organisation is the "Naturpark Bayerischer Wald" whose head office is in Zwiesel, Bavaria. It was established in 1967 and is thus the oldest nature park in Bavaria.
Location.
The Bavarian Forest Nature Park lies in the southeast of Germany between the Danube and the highlands of the Bavarian Forest along the Bavarian-Bohemian border. In the east it is adjoined by the Bavarian Forest National Park and in the north by the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park. Its neighbouring protected areas on the Czech side of the border are the Bohemian Forest ("Šumava") Protected Area and Bohemian Forest National Park. In the southeast the area of the nature park borders on the Upper Austrian district of Mühlviertel.
Natural region.
The territory of the Bavarian Forest Nature Park begins at the Danube at a height of about 320-metres above sea level. Here there are the last remains of riparian woodland and structurally rich ox-bow lakes. The Lallinger Winkel is well known for its scattered orchards. On the anterior chain of the Bavarian Forest, the so-called Danube Hills, the last examples of the threatened capercaillie still survive, as they do in the highlands of the inner Bavarian Forest.
An ecologically very rich rock formation is the Pfahl. It runs in a southeasterly direction for about 140 kilometres from the neighbouring Bavarian province of Upper Palatinate to the state of Upper Austria. The weather resistant quartz rock protrudes above the surrounding gneisses by several metres and offers a habitat for many warmth-loving animal and plant species. In the Inner Bavarian Forest there are still structure-rich mixed mountain woodlands and the typical highland spruce forests with raised bogs and areas of "Schachten", the last relicts of mountain pasture.
The Bavarian Forest is part of the largest contiguous forest in Central Europe and, together with the neighbouring Bohemian Forest, is of outstanding importance for nature and landscape conservation. The partly near-natural woods in the border region and the attractive, historical cultural landscape make the Bavarian Forest Nature Park an important component in the conservation of major landscapes.
Numerous animal and plant species which have become very rare or are threatened with extinction in Bavaria and Germany as a whole, have found their last refuge areas in this region.

Crokicurl

Crokicurl is a Canadian winter sport invented by Liz Wreford and Leanne Muir of Public City Architecture and first played in Winnipeg, Canada.
The game is a large scale hybrid of curling and the board game Crokinole. Crokinole is a game in which the players take turn to flick small discs on a circular board, to score highest depending on where the disc lands on the board where the regions are marked with score. In the crokicurl version of the game, rocks are used instead of discs which are roughly the size of a curling stone. The game uses junior curling stones which are 25 lbs instead of 38 - 44 lbs for regular curling stones. The game is played by teams consisting of two players, trying to score points by throwing the stones into the center of the ice where the circles are marked. The highest circle is marked with twenty points.
Crokicurl has spread from Winnipeg all across the county to small towns and large cities including Saskatoon, Calgary, Regina, Kenora, Guelph, Penetanguishene &amp; Midland, ON, Wiikwemkoong, Ramara, and Fort St. John, Gull Lake, SK, Melfort, Binscarth, Sylvan Lake, AB, Hanna, Alberta, Prince Albert, SK, Estevan, Neepawa, Yorkton, Swift Current, Shellbrook, Centre-Ville de Kénogami, Saguenay, Quebec and Cornwall, Prince Edward Island.
The first American rink created, and contested national championship, was on Valentine's Day weekend 2021 in Altoona, Wisconsin.

78K

78K is the trademark name of 16- and 8-bit microcontroller family
manufactured by Renesas Electronics, originally developed by NEC
started in 1986.
The basis of 78K Family is an accumulator-based register-bank CISC architecture.
78K is a single-chip microcontroller, which usually integrates; program ROM, data RAM, serial interfaces, timers, I/O ports, an A/D converter, an interrupt controller, and a CPU core, on one die.
Its application area is mainly simple mechanical system controls and man-machine interfaces.
Regarding software development tools, C compilers and macro-assemblers are available.
As for development tool hardware, full probing-pod type and debug port type in-circuit emulators,
and flash ROM programmers
are available.
Historically, the family has 11 series with 9 instruction set architectures. As of 2018, 3 instruction set architectures, those are 8-bit 78K0, 8-bit 78K0S, and 16-/8-bit 78K0R, are still promoted for customers' new designs.
But in most of cases, migration to RL78 Family,
which is a successor of 78K0R and almost binary level compatible with 78K0R,
is recommended.
Variants.
78K0 Series.
 (also known as 78K/0) is a long-running 8-bit single chip microcontroller,
which is the basis of 78K0S and 78K0R Series. It contains 8× 8-bit registers ×4 banks. For 16-bit calculating instructions, it performs ALU operation twice. Each instructions are performed serially without instruction pipelining. It has 16-bit 64K Byte address space. Some variants of 78K0 have affordable and compact type 8-bit R-2R D/A converter, which does not have monotonicity because it is not trimmed for adjustment nor followed by operational amplifier.
In its earlier stage, the "Program Memory" was one-time PROM (OTP), UV-EPROM, or mask ROM.
But with the times, it became flash memory.&lt;ref name="78K0/Dx2"&gt;
Renesas official: 
&lt;/ref&gt;
78K0S Series.
78K0S Series (also known as 78K/0S) is a low-end version of 78K0.

Battle of Gdov

The Battle of Gdov in the Russo-Swedish War took place on September 16, 1657 in Gdov. The battle was a clear victory for Prince Ivan Khovansky of the Tsardom of Russia over Swedish Governor-General Count Magnus De la Gardie allowing the Russians to regroup after a brief resurgence of Swedish resistance.
Prelude.
After the defeat at Walk, in July 1657, Ivan Khovansky was appointed as the Pskov voivode. His army was reinforced with 10 companies of Reiters and 3 companies of Dragoons (about 1,200 men). In September, the Swedes under Governor-General Count Magnus De la Gardie invaded the Gdov district, but Prince Khovansky timely learned about the invasion of the Swedish army and managed to reinforce the garrison of the city to 1,000 men (300 noble militia, 300 Don Cossacks, 200 Streltsy, 100 Luga Cossacks, 100 mercenaries), but with only two guns. Nevertheless, the garrison managed to repel all attacks, and even make several successful sorties.
Battle.
Upon learning of the arrival of the Swedes, Prince Khovansky hastily advanced to Gdov. On the night of September 16, Russian troops caught the retreating army of Delagardi 3 versts from Gdov on the river Chermi. Beginning the persecution, Prince Khovansky sent forward the cavalry: 12 noble hundreds, Don Cossacks and Reiters. The decisive action was the attack of the Russian Reiters, who knocked the enemy out of position and fled. De la Gardie ordered all his artillery to be thrown into the water. In 15 versts of persecution, Russian troops scattered enemy forces. Swedes lost many officers, banners, artillery and over 1.000 men.
Aftermath.
Having broken the troops of the Governor-General Count De la Gardie, the victory of Prince Khovansky greatly diminished the recent successes of the Swedish army in 1657, and restored the strategic initiative of the Russian army.

The 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared

The 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared is a 2016 Swedish comedy adventure film directed by Felix Herngren and Måns Herngren. The film serves as a sequel to the 2013 film "The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared", based on the novel of the same name by Jonas Jonasson.
Plot.
One year after the events of previous film, Allan Karlsson and company celebrate Alan's 101st birthday in Bali. Allan offers Miriam and Julius his last "Folksoda", a carbonated beverage Allan accidentally helped create during his double agent days at the height of the Cold War in the 1970s. As Miriam and Julius argue over who gets to finish the soda, Allan's pet capuchin Erlander finishes the whole bottle. Soon after, Miriam and her husband Benny depart for Malmköping, while Allan and Julius stay at the resort with Gäddan. 
Allan mentions that while that was the last Folksoda in existence, he stashed away the secret formula inside a Montecristo cigar box in Berlin. Allan tells the story of how his disastrous visit to a Russian lab with Popov led to the creation of Folksoda after the lab burned down in an electrical fire. Julius convinces Allan to call Amanda Einstein, who invites them to come to Berlin and retrieve the formula from her apartment. Julius, Allan, and Gäddan flee the resort (without paying their bill) and head for the airport. During check-in, a pair of security guards recognize Julius from a viral video in which he chases after Erlander on the beach. On the flight to Berlin, a stewardess named Rebecca opens Allan's carry-on suitcase and unknowingly allows Erlander to escape. The pilot contacts the nearest communications tower and makes an emergency landing in Moscow. 
Meanwhile, a woman named Stirna meets with her therapist, Håkan, after she sees news coverage of the viral video featuring Julius and Erlander on the beach and the plane's emergency landing in Russia. She recognizes Allan as the man who stole the secret formula from her father, Popov. Hysterical, she convinces Håkan to join her in tracking down Allan and company in Moscow. At the same time, Rebecca returns home to her husband Bas, who recognizes Allan's description as the man who stole 50 million dollars from Bas's deceased brother, Pim. Bas packs a bag full of weapons and heads to Moscow. 
Allan, Julius, and Gäddan are freed by Russian authorities but keep Erlander under quarantine at the airport. They check into a hotel where Allan recounts the story of how creating Folksoda led to top-secret meetings with Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon. During a film shoot for Folksoda in East Germany, Allan met Popov's young daughter, Kristina. At the airport, Stirna bribes the Russian authorities into giving her Erlander. She pressures Håkan into organizing a swap with Allan: Erlander in exchange for the secret formula. When Allan and Julius arrive, they discover Håkan dead, having choked on the cork of a champagne bottle during an altercation with Erlander. Allan, Julius, and Gäddan board a train for Berlin, with Stirna and Bas in hot pursuit. In Malmköping, Inspector Aronsson receives word that two CIA agents will be investigating a slew of suspicious activity in town, brought upon by Miriam and Benny making international calls about Folksoda to Allan. 
Stirna lies about her identity and joins the group on their trip to Berlin. Bas attempts to hold Gäddan at gunpoint but two passengers disable his weapon. Gäddan hotwires a car in Warsaw and the group proceeds to Berlin. Allan falls asleep and dreams about the night Popov was killed by East German border patrol guards as he tried to leave the country with Allan and the secret formula. With his final breath, he tells Allan that the secret formula must be delivered to "K". 
The group arrives in Berlin and finds Amanda. She reminisces with Allan about a wild party in the 1970s where Allan got a tattoo on his left buttock while under the effects of LSD. Julius walks in on the two of them having sex. At Miriam's behest, Benny goes to Allan's old nursing home and collects his belongings, hoping to find more bottles of Folksoda. Inspector Aronsson meets with the CIA agents, who make plans to visit Benny at his home by the lake. Stirna and Allan locate the cigar box inside a secret compartment, only to find that it contains nothing but cigars. Allan discerns that the formula is in his other cigar box in Malmköping. Unknown to the group, Bas is tracking Stirna using cellphone locator software and follows the group to Sweden. 
Inspector Aronsson and the CIA agents arrive at Benny's home, where their questioning is interrupted by Benny's constant vomiting from nervousness. They head to the nursing home and speak with the staff as to Allan's whereabouts. Concurrently, Allan and Julius sneak into the nursing home's storage area but Allan's belongings are already gone. Allan, Julius, Gäddan, and Stirna race to Benny's house and arrive just in time to save the cigar box from being used as kindling. They retrieve the formula, in microfiche form, and attempt to decipher it on Benny's microfiche reader. 
Stirna confesses to Allan that she is Popov's daughter Kristina. Having finally found "K", Allan gives her the formula and tells her to return home. As Julius tries to stop her, the CIA agents arrive along with Bas, who holds everyone at gunpoint. Benny gives Bas the money Allan stole from Pim and the microfiche reader. Inspector Aronsson shoots Bas, who falls into a well and is killed by his own exploding grenade. The explosion destroys the money and the microfiche reader. The CIA agents arrest Gäddan and extradite him to the United States for his past crimes. Inspector Aronsson receives a medal from the government for his service. Julius discovers that Allan's tattoo on his buttock is a Russian transcription of how to make Folksoda. 
Some time later, Miriam and Benny organize a luncheon at their house for Allan Jr., their newborn son. Stirna, having decided to stay with her new friends, helps Julius with creating Folksoda in an outdoor synthesis lab, but are missing a vital step in the creation process. Allan sits down with his friends to enjoy the meal as he carries both Allan Jr. and Erlander. A lightning bolt strikes Julius's makeshift lab, mimicking the electrical fire Allan caused all those years ago.

Chinese characters for transcribing Slavonic

Chinese characters for transcribing Slavonic were Chinese characters created for the purpose of transcribing Slavonic sounds into Chinese. The Russian Orthodox Church's mission in China had an interest in translating liturgical texts into Chinese and Japanese, and sought to devise new characters for this purpose.
Many of these new characters were proposed by Archimandrite Gurias, the 14th head of the Russian mission from 1858–1864. They would have transcribed certain syllables normally not valid in standard Chinese phonology, such as "vin", "gi", or "reia". These characters were later used for transcription into Japanese as well, with the character pronunciations changed to account for Japanese phonology. However, in both China and Japan, leaders of the Russian missions eventually decided to translate liturgical texts using standard vernacular Chinese and katakana, respectively.
The majority of the new characters were composed through combining two existing characters side-by-side as radicals, which would also indicate their pronunciation. Unlike the typical rule of pronouncing the character based on the side radical, used in pronouncing phono-semantic compounds, the radicals are presented in initial-rime pairs. In a method similar to Fanqie, the right-hand character would indicate the syllable initial, while the left-hand character would be used as an indicator of the final. This approach to character formation was intended for vertical reading, where the flow of the text is from top-to-bottom, and ordered from right-to-left. Two exceptions were vertically-arranged characters used as abbreviations of "Christ" and "Jesus".
Twenty Slavonic transcription characters were included in Unicode Standard version 10.0.

Eliza Emily Donnithorne

Eliza Emily Donnithorne (8 July 1821 – 20 May 1886) was an Australian woman best known as a possible inspiration for the character of Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens' 1861 novel "Great Expectations".
Biography.
Early life.
Eliza Donnithorne was born at the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, and spent her early childhood in Calcutta where her father, James Donnithorne, worked for the East India Company as master of the mint and later as a judge. Her mother was Sarah Elizabeth Donnithorne, nee Bampton. Sarah Donnithorne and the couple's two older daughters died during a cholera epidemic in the 1830s. In 1838, when Eliza was about 17 years old, her father retired and moved to Sydney. Eliza seems to have lived in England for some years with her brother and his wife, before joining her father in New South Wales in 1846. In Sydney they lived at Cambridge Hall (later known as Camperdown Lodge) at 36 King Street, Newtown. When her father died in May 1852, Eliza inherited most of his estate.
Broken engagement and later life.
Although there are multiple versions of the story and historical evidence is scarce, most accounts of Donnithorne's life focus on a broken engagement when she was about 30 years old. Some sources name her fiancé as George Cuthbertson, a clerk with a shipping company. On the morning of the wedding, her fiancé did not arrive at Cambridge Hall for the wedding breakfast. The story goes that she ordered that the feast and decorations be left out, and spent the rest of her life as a recluse. Some versions say that she never took off her wedding dress.
A 1946 retelling captures the recurring details of the story: The guests were assembled, and the wedding breakfast prepared. Eliza, clad in her bridal gown, awaited the arrival of the groom. He never came. She never heard from him again. When the guests had departed, Eliza pulled down the blinds of her house, and for 30 years remained a hermit. The front door was chained pemitting it to open only a few inches; callers never saw her, for when she was forced to speak to them, she remained out of sight. Here, for those long years, lived a woman in whom hope had died. When death at last came to Eliza, those who came to carry her to the greater peace of Camperdown Cemetery found her still clad in her bridal gown. Dust lay thick on the floor, and the window panes were thick with grime. And in the dining room, the wedding feast was uneaten, and the food had mouldered into dust.
Death and legacy.
Donnithorne died in 1886 and was buried at St Stephen's church in Newtown (now Camperdown Cemetery) alongside her father. Her grave remains one of the cemetery's most visited by tourists. When it was vandalised in 2004, the Australian National Trust and the UK Dickens Society contributed to the cost of its restoration.
As inspiration for Miss Havisham.
The claim that Eliza Donnithorne inspired the character of Miss Havisham in "Great Expectations" has been part of Australian literary lore since at least the last decades of the 19th century.
Charles Dickens never visited Australia, but he was interested in the Australian colonies and wrote frequently about them in his weekly journal, "Household Words". There are several theories as to how he may have encountered the story of Eliza Donnithorne.
One 1935 newspaper report describes Donnithorne's father, James, as "a great friend of the famous writer", but offers no source for this statement.
Another theory suggests that the Sydney-based social reformer Caroline Chisholm, who met Dickens in England in 1850 and corresponded with him about the Australian colonies, may have told Dickens about Donnithorne. Chisholm's descriptions of life in New South Wales were published in Dickens' "Household Words", and the character of Mrs Jellyby in Dickens' "Bleak House" was likely based in part on Chisholm. Chisholm would have had opportunity to hear about Donnithorne: she ran a school for girls in Newtown, near Donnithorne's home; Chisholm and her husband were part of the same small Sydney philanthropic circle as Donnithorne's father; and Chisholm and Eliza Donnithorne were at one point treated by the same Sydney doctor.
Some versions of the story speculate that Dickens' sons, two of whom spent time in Australia, told the story to their father. However, they arrived in Australia after "Great Expectations" was published.
Other historians propose an alternative explanation: that Dickens did not base Miss Havisham on Donnithorne, but that Sydney readers drew the connection when "Great Expectations" was published in 1861, and over time embellished Donnithorne's story with details borrowed from Dickens' book. This is the tentative conclusion reached by Evelyn Juers in her 2012 book "The Recluse", the most thorough recent investigation of the story.
In popular culture and the arts.
Opera: "Miss Donnithorne's Maggot" is an operatic work, with music by Peter Maxwell Davies and text by Randolph Stow.
Literature: Eliza Donnithorne features in the children's novel "I Am Susannah" by Libby Gleeson (Angus &amp; Robertson, 1987).

Louisa Stanhope, Countess Stanhope

Louisa Stanhope, Countess Stanhope (28 July 1758 – 7 March 1829), formerly Louisa Grenville, was the second wife of Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope. Some sources have suggested her to be the same person as the contemporary novelist Louisa Sidney Stanhope, but there is no evidence for this other than the fact that the countess is known to have been a great reader.
Louisa was the daughter and sole heiress of Henry Grenville, a diplomat and politician, and his wife, the former Margaret Eleanor Banks. Grenville was a younger brother of Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, and of George Grenville, a British prime minister. She married the future earl on 19 March 1781, less than a year after the death of his first wife, Hester, who had been Louisa's first cousin, her grandmother, Hester Pitt, Countess of Chatham, being Henry Grenville's sister. There were three surviving daughters from Stanhope's first marriage, including Lady Hester Stanhope, who was later sent to live with her grandmother.
Stanhope inherited the earldom in 1786, making his wife a countess.
The couple had three sons:
In 1806 Joseph Farington recorded that "Lord Stanhopes behaviour to his wife Lady Stanhope has caused her to obtain a separate maintenance." He went on to state that the earl had settled £1500 a year on his wife in order to escape the threat of being openly accused of adultery. Mrs Walburga Lackner, who had been taken on by the countess to give music lessons to her children, was left money in the earl's will. 
Louisa died at her London home in Clarges Street, aged 70, after a long illness. John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, wrote to her eldest son on 10 March 1829 to express his condolences.

Under the plan of the Russian command, in the campaign of 1656 the main blow was inflicted on Riga, where a large army led by Tsar Alexis advanced from Polotsk . Auxiliary blows were applied from Pskov to Dorpat (Russian: Yuryev) and from Novgorod to Noteburg (Oreshek) and Nyenschanz. The capture of Dorpat was entrusted to the army of Alexey Trubetskoy.
The army of Trubetskoy was quite numerous. On the paper there were 5546 cavalry (3327 nobles, 832 Reiters, 622 Cossacks and102 Tatars) and about 5,000 infantry (3 Streltsy orders and 4 regiments of the New Order). The garrison of the fortress, commanded by Lars Fleming, consisted of an infantry regiment (448 soldiers in 5 companies), 45 artillerymen and about 100 regular cavalrymen. They were supported by several hundred armed burghers.
Siege.
The main forces of the Russian army approached the fortress in the early days of August. The Swedish garrison actively opposed siege operations, undertaking frequent forays. The fighting was not limited to fighting at the walls of the fortress. The Swedish troops attempted to break through the blockade and conduct reinforcements to Dorpat. The attempt to undermine the walls was not successful, and artillery was also not effective. The best siege guns were sent to the main army near Riga, the quantity and power available was not enough. By this time the main army had already failed at the siege of Riga . On October 23, the Swedish garrison had agreed to an honorable surrender. This was affected by heavy losses from shelling and disease (there were only 140 soldiers left) and the lack of assistance and news from the outside.
Aftermath.
The capture of Yuryev became the greatest success of the Russian army in the war, especially significant against the background of the failure of the main Russian army in the siege of Riga. The city, despite the attempt of the Swedes to retake it, remained in the hands of the Russian troops until the end of the war. Only in 1661 according to the peace treaty the city was returned to Sweden.

Operation Dragnet

Operation Dragnet was a security operation conducted by the 1st Cavalry Division in Bình Định Province, lasting from 26 May 1967 to 27 January 1968.
Background.
In May 1967, I Field Force expanded the mission of the 1st Cavalry Division to include the destruction of the Viet Cong (VC) infrastructure in Bình Định Province. The South
Vietnamese 816th National Police Field Force Battalion was assigned to assist the 1st Cavalry and was stationed at the 1st Cavalry's headquarters at Landing Zone Two Bits.
Operation.
The operation commenced on 26 May, comprising numerous small security sweeps by combined 1st Cavalry/Police units. The 1st Cavalry troops would secure an area and the National Police would interrogate, identify and arrest suspected VC. The National Police progressively built up detailed intelligence of suspected VC and repeated sweeps and interrogations led to the arrest of more and more suspected VC. The operation used many of the tactics of what would later become known as the Phoenix Program.
In September 1967 the 222nd National Police Field Force Battalion replaced the 816th Battalion.
By the conclusion of the operation the 1st Cavalry/National Police had conducted over 900 security sweeps and conducted over 323,261 interrogations leading to the capture of 944 suspected VC.
Aftermath.
Operation Dragnet officially concluded on 27 January 1968, U.S. losses were 12 killed with VC losses claimed as 223 killed.

Sarajevo cable car

Sarajevo Cable Car () is a cable car in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, connecting the old part of the city with the mountain Trebević.
History.
Trebević Cable Car was first built in 1959, and opened for the public on May 3, 1959. It had a capacity of 400 passengers per hour. However, the many years of operation and repairs took a toll on the cable car which resulted in serious problems, so much so that the relevant institutions forbade further repairs of the cable car. Such issues arose in 1977, 1982, 1986, 1987, and in particular on November 18, 1989, when further repairs of the cable car was banned by the Institute "ZRMK" from Ljubljana.
During the Bosnian War (1992–1995), the cable car was completely destroyed.
Reopening in 2018.
After its closing in 1989, Trebević Cable Car resumed operations in 2018. Trebević Cable Car was reconstructed between 2017 and 2018, and officially reopened on April 6, 2018. A total of 33 modern cable cars make up the new system, which can transport up to 1,200 passengers from the city to Trebević per hour, with a ride duration of nine minutes each way.
Mufid Garibija, the designer of the Trebević cable railway station and the starting station, said that the entire lane would be panoramic, and the stations and gondolas would dominate the glass, which would contribute to the enjoyment of visitors in view of Sarajevo. "Gondolas will be in the colors of the Olympic circles and will reflect the unity and multi-ethnicity of Sarajevo," said Garibija.
The cable car has 33 gondolas, of which five are in the colors of the Olympic circles - blue, red, yellow, green and black, one in the color of the flag of BiH, while the other ones are black.
To announce the cable car's reopening, a promotional song named "Trebević opet silazi u grad" (eng: "Trebević is coming to the city again") was officially presented on March 23, 2018. The song was performed by singers Hari Varešanović, Ismeta Dervoz, Zdravko Čolić, and Jasna Gospić, all born in Sarajevo and former members of the band Ambasadori.

Marie Henning

Marie Henning (born Maria Mahnke: 26 December 1895 - 5 January 1948) was a German activist and politician (KPD). After her husband was murdered in 1931 the party nominated her to seek election to the Hamburg Parliament ("Hamburgische Bürgerschaft") in his place. She was successful, and sat as a member of the Hamburg Parliament from September 1931 until democratic institutions were withdrawn during the early summer of 1933.
Life.
Marie Caroline Henriette Mahnke was born at Nossentiner Hütte, a small village in the marshy flatlands between Rostock and Berlin. By 1920 she was living in Hamburg and had been married, since 1913, to . They were both activist members of the recently launched Communist Party. She was a member of the Women's Policy department of the party district leadership ("Bezirksleitung") for the Wasserkant district (surrounding Hamburg to the north of the river. She also belonged to the Soviet sponsored Red Aid workers' welfare association. Meanwhile her husband became a member of the Hamburg Parliament ("Hamburgische Bürgerschaft") in 1927/28. However, he was murdered by Nazi fanatics on 14 March 1931 while heading back from a political meeting to the city on a late night bus. The event resonated widely, with 35,000 demonstrators reportedly following his coffin to its final resting place at Hamburg's Ohlsdorf Cemetery. At the next election, which took place in September 1931, despite being the widowed mother of three small children, Marie Henning stood for election to the parliament in his place. She was elected.
Régime change in January 1933 was followed by a Nazi paramilitary invasion of parliament in March 1933, during the course of which communist members were arrested. Democratic processes were being systematically abolished and the final sitting of the parliament took place in June 1933. Marie Henning was arrested several times during the twelve Nazi years, although sources are vague as to times and places. She appears to have been arrested between May and June 1933 and again in March 1936. Her final arrest came in the context of "Aktion Gitter", a mass arrest of more than 5,000 people that took place overnight on 22/23 August, probably in response to an assassination attempt against the leader on 20 July 1944. Those arrested were identified on (in many cases out of date) lists of people who had been politically active members of (non-Nazi) political parties before 1933. Marie Henning was one of those who were released in September 1944 after just a few weeks in detention.
War ended in May 1945 along with the Nazi régime. Marie Henning lived on for another two and a half years during which she was an active member of the Committee of former political prisoners in Hamburg-Bergedorf ("Komitee ehemaliger politischer Gefangener in Hamburg-Bergedorf "). However, during these final years much of her time was spent in hospital, and she died of cancer in Hamburg on 5 January 1948.
Family.
Marie Henning was married twice: both her husbands predeceased her, and both died violent deaths. Her first marriage, to , ended when her husband was murdered on a bus in 1931. This marriage produced one son and two daughters. The couple's son, Otto, was killed on the Russian front in August 1944.
Her second marriage was to Carl Rohde, a former leader of the pre-Nazi Black-Red-Gold anti-extremist organisation. He was conscripted into the army and died on 5 June 1944 at a munitions depot in when an anti-tank "Panzerfaust" gun exploded.
Celebration.
In 1995 a street was renamed the "Marie-Henning-Weg" in the Neuallermöhe (Bergedorf) quarter of Hamburg.

Chalk Dust - The Umpire Strikes Back

Chalk Dust – The Umpire Strikes Back is a 1982 novelty song by The Brat, which was a collective pseudonym for British comedians Kaplan Kaye and Roger Kitter. The song satirizes tennis champion John McEnroe who was notorious for his temper tantrums. It managed to reach number 19 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1982. Its B-side was a track named "Moody Mole" and the cover art was by illustrator Graham Humphreys.
The song.
"Chalk Dust – The Umpire Strikes Back" is a satire of American tennis player John McEnroe and lampoons his infamous angry behaviour on the tennis court to a synthesizer beat. The entire song is a conversation between McEnroe (played by Roger Kitter) and the referee (played by Kaplan Kaye). They bicker and bicker until the referee finally loses his patience and just shoots McEnroe dead. The line "The ball's in, everyone can see that the ball's in!" was an actual quotation McEnroe used to shout. As McEnroe dies in the song his final words are: "I was talking to myself!", which also a genuine excuse the real-life McEnroe used whenever a referee scolded him for being insulted. The title is a pun on the film "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) and the tennis term umpire. Released on the Hansa label, the single entered the UK Singles Chart on 10 July 1982. It reached a peak of number 19, and remained in the chart for 8 weeks. The song was also a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium and a Top 20 hit in South Africa and Ireland.

Georgius Hornius

Georgius Hornius (Georg Horn, 1620–1670) was a German historian and geographer, professor of history at Leiden University from 1653 until his death.
Life.
He was born in Kemnath, Upper Palatinate (at the time part of the Electoral Palatinate under Frederick V) as the son of the superintendent of the Reformed church there. 
His family was forced to move away in the wake of the Catholic victory at White Mountain, when Horn was still an infant. 
In 1635, he visited the gymnasium in Nuremberg, and in 1637 he was enrolled in University of Altdorf as a student of theology and medicine.
He later worked as a private tutor, in Gröningen and later in Leiden, in the Dutch Republic. In Leiden, he was also enrolled as a student of Friedrich Spanheim. After a two year's sojourn in England, he returned to Leiden, compiling a history of the events of the ongoing English Civil War ("Rerum Britannicarum libri VII", "De statu ecclesiae Britannicae hodierno").
In 1648, he completed a doctorate in Leiden and refused calls to both Frankfurt University and Heidelberg University as professor of theology, instead accepting the position of professor of history, politics and geography at the new University of Harderwijk, where he became rector in 1652. In 1653, he became professor of history at Leiden University, a position he held until his death in 1670.
In his later life, Horn was also greatly interested in alchemy. In 1665, he was swindled out of the considerable sum of 5,000 guilders by a fraudulent alchemist. 
His interest in alchemy als resulted in an edition of Pseudo-Geber in 1668.
From about this time, he also began to suffer from intermittent spells of mental distraction, although he remained a prolific writer until his death.
Among his publications, his Latin works on universal history, intended as a textbook for students, wer especially influential ("Historia ecclesiastica et politica", "Arca Noae", "Orbis Politicus", "Orbis Imperans"). These works were re-published long after his death in both the Netherlands and Germany.
His treated universal history in a modern manner, no longer divided into the history of the four classical empires (Assyria, Persia, Macedon, Rome) but based on the concept of national history, including the history of the peoples of the New World ("De originibus Americanis").
He was also one of the earliest historiographers to divide world history into three major epochs, antiquity from earliest times until the Migration period, the middle period from the Migration period to the year 1500, and modern history from 1500 to his own day.
His coverage of the Migration period is presented as the history of the "Scythian" nation, which is divided into Germans, Huns and Slavs.
In all his works, Horn presents himself as a pious Protestant and as a patriot of his homeland, considering himself a native of and exile from the Upper Palatinate (which had been annexed by the Catholic Duke of Bavaria in 1628).

Environmental issues in Senegal

Senegal's environmental issues are varied. According to the CIA world factbook pressing problems exist with: diminishing wildlife populations which are threatened by poaching, deforestation, overgrazing, soil erosion, desertification, and overfishing.
Deforestation and land degradation.
Like other parts of West Africa and the developing world, social forces and policies are leading to deforestation and ecosystem degradation, leading to effects like Desertification and social erosion. Charcoal production, alongside pressure to expand agriculture in Senegal to meet the quadrupling of population has led to increased loss of forest.
In 2006, Senegal still had 45.1% —or about 8,673,000 hectares—of forest with 18.4% — or roughly 1,598,000 hectares — classified as primary forest. In 2007 Senegal was losing 350,000 hectares of forest per year through slash-and-burn for farming because of its rapidly growing population. Variability of rainfall compounded with issues like climate change, lead About 13% of the land - holding about 22% of the population - are now considered degraded. Senegal had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.11/10, ranking it 56th globally out of 172 countries.
In 2016, the government warned that the Casamance forest cover would have vanished by 2018, if illegal logging continued.
Mitigation.
Since 1970s Senegal has lost 25% of its mangrove forests. Recent efforts have been led by the organization Oceanium to replant the mangroves.
The national Forest Service designed in the early 2000s was designed to democratize and decentralize forest management. However, subsequent analysis by academics found that inequalities favor commercial interests and exploitation by economic forces.
Overfishing.
West African communities face pressure from both overfishing by local fleets as well as Asian and European fleets harvesting from fisheries in West Africa as other fisheries become overfished or collapse. For example fleets in 2017 Saint-Louis, Senegal have seen a large decline in harvest, causing ripple effects on nutrition and food supply in the country, where 75% of animal protein comes from fish.

Karadaiyan Nonbu

Karadaiyan Nonbu is a festival performed by married women from the Tamil community. It is celebrated on the first day of Panguni in the southern calendar as it represents the fish like shape of the eyes of Goddess Parvati. Her Birthday falls on the same day.
Legend &amp; Celebration.
Historically, married women pray to the Hindu goddess Gowri and pray for longevity and well-being of their respective husbands. Women try to echo the devotion and love shown by Savitri for her husband Satyavan, as seen in the tale of Savitri and Satyavan, told in the epic Mahabharata. Married women fast that day. Before the auspicious time, women draw kolam in front of their pooja room, take bath and officiate the ceremony with the pooja. Typically, an offering made out of rice powder and jaggery is prepared and offered to the goddess. It is said that Savitri's devotion towards the goddess Gowri gave her the strength and wisdom to win back her husband's life from lord Yama, the Lord of death. She won the battle not by arms or ammunition, but by her clever arguments. When Yama offered her a wish, she prayed for a thousand sons. After he agreed, Savitri sought the life of her dead husband back to fulfill this wish.
Preparation of adai.
Bhog is a special adai prepared out of rice flour, black eyed peas, jaggery and coconut. It is eaten hot and with butter.

Woof! (band)

Woof! or Woof! Percussion Ensemble were an Australian classical music, four-piece percussion ensemble formed in February 1995 by Robert Cossom, Matthew Goddard, Stephen Hardie and Tracey Patten. In July 1997 they appeared on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio, ABC Classic FM's "Sunday Live" presented by Peter Clarke performing at Iwaki Auditorium, Melbourne. Instrumentation used included xylophone, marimba, vibraphone, drums, key and non-pitched percussion, and log drums.
Their album, "Percy Grainger: Tuneful Percussion" or "Tuneful Percussion" (2000), featuring arrangements and compositions by Percy Grainger, received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 for Best Classical Album. It was recorded between May and November 1999 by the ensemble of Goddard, Hardie, Patten and Christine Baker on percussion. They were joined in the studio by Mary Anderson on harp, Kirsten Boerema on vocals (mezzo-soprano), Wendy Clarke on flute and piccolo, Sylvia Hosking on double bass, Mark Knoop on celeste, harmonium and piano, London String Quartet on strings, Vaughan McAlley on vocals (tenor) and Clifford Plumpton on vocals (bass). James Manheim of AllMusic rated it at four-out-of-five stars and explained, "presents music from a neglected aspect of Grainger's output: his music for 'tuned percussion,' which he defined as glockenspiels, xylophones, and bells, augmented by such related instruments as the celeste, piano, and the instruments of the Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestras."

Bodil Kaalund

Bodil Marie Kaalund-Jørgensen (1930–2016) was an award-winning Danish painter, textile artist and writer, who is remembered above all for her artwork in Danish churches and for her Bible illustrations. She was also a major contributor to the recognition of Greenland's cultural heritage, thanks in part to her "Grønlands Kunst", published in English in 1983 as "The Art of Greenland".
Early life and education.
Born in Silkeborg on 8 November 1930, Bodil Marie Kaalund was the daughter of the painter Martin Kaalund-Jørgensen (1889–1952) and Hilda Jenny Rasmussen (1896–1984), a teacher. It was thanks to her father that she became interested in painting from an early age. Her mother, who never worked professionally, became her teacher when she and her elder sister spent their long summers in their Røsnæs summerhouse. In 1943, the family moved to Lyngby where she lived for the rest of her life.
Kaalund attended the state school in Lyngby. In her early teens, she became interested in religious art. This was reinforced in 1946 when she discovered the work of Edvard Munch while on holiday in Norway. When she was just 18, she exhibited two landscape paintings at Den Frie Udstilling's autumn exhibition.
After matriculating from high school, she studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Kræsten Iversen, Holger J. Jensen and Elof Risebye, graduating in 1954. In 1950, Kaalund married the painter Nikolaj Nielsen. They had one child together, Magnus, but the marriage was dissolved in 1976.
Career.
While at the Royal Academy, Kaalund met the Greenlandic artist and writer Jens Rosing. As a result, she developed a keen interest in the art and culture of Greenland. In 1968, she travelled there to arrange the first exhibition of Danish art ever held in Greenland. The following year, she went on the arrange an exhibition of Greenlandic art in Denmark in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. She later collaborated with Hans Lynge to establish "Grønlands Kunstskole" (Greenland's Art School), which opened in 1972. In 1979, she published "Grønlands kunst" (translated as "The Art of Greenland"), the first extensive work of its kind.
Kaalund became recognized for her artwork with her painting "Korsnedtagelsen" (Descent from the Cross) in 1966. She became one of the first female artists to decorate churches when in 1972 she decorated the altar wall of Erlev Church on the island of Mors with a picture of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. In 1977, she decorated Lemvig Church in the west of Jutland, establishing a lasting relationship with the locality. She was instrumental in establishing the town's "Museet for Religiøs Kunst" (Museum for Religious Art) in 1994. She decorated a total of 27 churches including Solbjerg Church and Hvidovre's Strandmark Church.
She also illustrated several religious works with Biblical scenes. He major work in this connected was the new authorized Danish edition of the Bible which was published in 1992. It contained 159 illustrations. The original watercolours can be seen in the Lemvig Museum of Religious Art. Many of them are based on scenes from the countryside around the Limfjord and the west coast of Denmark.
Bodil Kaalund died in her sleep at her home in Lyngby on 22 December 2016.
Awards.
Kaalund has received many awards, including the Greenlandic Cultural Prize (2000) and the Academy's N. L. Høyen Medal (2002).

Airports Act 1986

The Airports Act 1986 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The act reformed civil aviation in Great Britain and privatised the British Airports Authority from a public department into BAA as a private company. It also granted additional regulatory powers to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
Effect.
The British Airports Authority was established in 1965 by the Airports Authority Act 1965 to take management of the UK's larger airports into public ownership under a government authority. The Airports Act 1986 transferred the powers relating to running government owned airports from the British Airports Authority from the public sector to the private sector as part of a Conservative Party government policy of privatisation. BAA plc. was created as a result of the act to take over the authority's responsibilities. The act also granted statutory authority to the CAA to continue to regulate civil aviation in the United Kingdom as well as BAA. At the time of passage, BAA became responsible for London Heathrow Airport, London Gatwick Airport, London Stansted Airport, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Glasgow International Airport, Edinburgh Airport and Aberdeen Airport. The act only applied to Great Britain and does not apply to Northern Ireland.
The act also included a number of miscellaneous provisions that were eventually mirrored in airport bylaws. This had the effect of making breaches of airport bylaws punishable under criminal law. An example of this was in 2016 where two people were arrested and charged for being "drunk or under the influence of drugs or other intoxicating substances" in "a restricted area of the airport" contrary to Sections 63 and 63.1 of the Airports Act.

Laurie Hislam

Laurence Hislam (1909 – 26 August 1966) was an English peace activist. Hislam's anti-war feelings and activism developed from about 1938, first in the Peace Pledge Union working with Basque child refugees from the Spanish Civil War. His first notable individual activism was in 1939, when he released "rubber ball bombs" from a suitcase, causing chaos in Downing Street, for which he served one month hard labour. As an anarchist conscientious objector in WWII he served periods of imprisonment, wrote for "War Commentary" (Freedom Press) and distributed anti-war literature. In 1945 he joined The London Forum discussion group and later worked for the Freedom Defence Committee in London. In 1951 Hislam moved to Gloucestershire, where he continued with anti-war protests and activism including having his head shaved in 1964 and 1965 for a vigil to commemorate the dropping of a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, many local CND demonstrations and a pilgrimage to Rome hoping to influence Pope John XXIII to condemn nuclear weapons. He was a founder member of the Committee of 100 and took part in many CND protests. He was killed in a car crash in 1966.
Early life.
Hislam was born in 1909, the second of four children in a working-class family in Camberwell, South East London. His father worked in transport, including driving horse-drawn and then steam-powered buses.
Until he was 28 Laurie lived a carefree existence. He was a conventional white-collar worker and his Denmark Hill tennis club, cricket team and its social activities occupied his free time. Then in 1938 he was confronted with peace posters outside Whitfield's Tabernacle in Rye Lane, Peckham, which changed his entire way of life. "War means total destruction." "War solves nothing." "It is the responsibility of each individual to see that it never happens again." The posters were part of an awareness campaign by the Peace Pledge Union (PPU), which Laurie joined. He became involved with the care of Basque child refugees who were living in a house in Langham, Essex, sponsored by the PPU. He kept in contact with two of the refugees after they returned to Spain in 1940.
On 28 August 1939, when war was imminent, Hislam went to 10 Downing Street, and opened a suitcase containing painted rubber balls. A photograph shows Hislam being hustled away by police after being injured by angry members of the crowd in Downing Street. There resulted the first of many prison sentences, one month's hard labour. He was invited by the BBC to appear on television to explain why he had done what he did. The incident and its reporting were reprised in "The Sunday Times" colour supplement on 27 August 1989 in a section on "Fifty Years ago today".
World War II.
Hislam expressed his opinion at London's Speaker's Corner. He registered as a conscientious objector and attended a tribunal, consisting mainly of retired military men. He was vociferous about his pacifist beliefs, confirmation of his registration was refused, and he became liable for military service. He evaded the authorities for a while, continuing anti-war activities, and then went underground under an assumed name.
Within the PPU Hislam belonged to the dissident Forward Movement of anarchists, with John Hewetson and Frederick Lohr. He wrote and distributed anarchist leaflets, including "Enemies of the People", published December 1941 in "War Commentary" by Freedom Press. Through Lohr he met his future wife, Winifred: they lived with him and other anarchists in Westbourne Terrace, London. In 1947 he was working for the Freedom Defence Committee publishing the FDC Bulletin at the time George Woodcock was secretary.
Lohr, Winifred and other members of the London Forum converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Jesuit priests of the Farm Street church, but Laurie was not convinced that he could be both Catholic and pacifist. By 1951 the couple had three daughters and moved to Gloucestershire.
In Gloucestershire.
Hislam lived near Stroud, Gloucestershire, where he worked as a clerk and later a postman. Winifred was a trained teacher and became the main breadwinner. During the fifties Laurie was confirmed a Catholic by William E. Orchard, the pacifist parish priest of St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill. In 1957 the couple bought a plot of land and Laurie built, single-handedly, a three-bedroomed wooden bungalow for the growing family. He took 'single-handed' to the extreme of making his own concrete blocks for the foundations as well as learning the skills of plumber and electrician. In 1957, while working on the construction, he was visited by Chelo and Chivvi, two of the Basque refugee children he had sponsored in 1938, now married and living in Bilbao.
The site of the house was chosen for its position near the Catholic St Mary of the Angels Church at Brownshill. This was the church built for a lay community of Dominican nuns, for whom Hislam worked for a time as a gardener. In the cellar of the bungalow he set up a pottery, building his own wheel and kiln. He sold pots at markets in the West Country. He was a friend of the peace activist John Papworth, whom he had met when both were in prison following an anti-war demonstration and who also had a house in Gloucestershire at this time. Through his work for the Movement for Colonial Freedom, Papworth became a friend, and later personal assistant, of Kenneth Kaunda and he took Kaunda to meet Laurie and his family in Brownshill.
By the time of Hislam's death in 1966, he and Winifred had six daughters aged from 19 to 2.
CND and Committee of 100.
Laurie was a member of the Direct Action Committee that preceded the formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He was arrested and jailed for taking part in the DAC nonviolent protest against all nuclear armaments at Harrington rocket base (Northants) 2 January 1960. A report in the PAX Bulletin refers to a photo on the front page of "The Observer" that included Laurie at the protest. He took part in the first march to Aldermaston in 1958 (organised by DAC) and subsequent CND Aldermaston or other Easter Marches until his death in 1966. He was a founder member of the Committee of 100 and retained a lifelong commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, often at a local level (by which time he was living in Gloucestershire). He was a long time associate of Pat Arrowsmith and family papers include correspondence with Hugh Brock and Bertrand Russell. Russell expressed support for Laurie in all his local pacifist activities and his action in writing to John F Kennedy, Harold Macmillan and Nikita Khrushchev in 1962 to protest against their recent nuclear tests. He received a reply from Macmillan. In March 1961 Ralph Schoenman visited Laurie in Gloucestershire and the two planned the breakaway 'Grosvenor Square' demonstration while walking with the family in the wild daffodil fields of Dymock. This was a breakaway from the main CND march from Aldermaston to Trafalgar Square. Hislam and Schoenman led a group of protesters who sat down in front of the American Embassy. Both were arrested and later fined 40 shillings with 10 guineas costs at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court. On 17 September 1961 Laurie was arrested and jailed for his part in a mass sit-down organised by the Committee of 100 in Trafalgar Square. In 1963 Laurie travelled to Berlin with four other Gloucestershire peace campaigners. They distributed leaflets near 'Checkpoint Charlie' and Laurie crossed briefly to East Berlin before being expelled.
Local Activism in Stroud.
Laurie was an active member of Stroud CND and initiated many small activisms of his own. He courted publicity in the local press (report extracts below) in order to get his message across to the people of Stroud. He lost no opportunity to have discussions with all and sundry about his beliefs and became known affectionately as Stroud's "Ban the bomb man".
Demand for C.D. cash fraudulent, he says.
"A prominent member of the Stroud branch of CND protested today to Stroud magistrates against a rate demand for Civil Defence purposes. Laurence A Hislam was summoned for failing to pay 2s 3d. He said "I believe that the council are levying this money fraudulently in so far as they are taking money for a service which it is physically impossible for them to carry out – namely, for protection of the inhabitants of Stroud in time of nuclear war"" "Evening Post, 23 September 1960"
Protest at sale of goods to pay rates.
"When a wheel barrow and a lawn mower, which Stroud RDC had seized, were put up for auction, the owner Mr Laurence Hislam, was there to protest and hand out leaflets. The articles were impounded because Mr Hislam, a member of CND, had refused to pay the Civil Defence portion of his rates. He claimed the council were taking money for a service they could not provide." "Gloucester Citizen, 3 June 1961"
Stroud nuclear disarmer jailed again.
"Laurence Hislam of Brownshill, Stroud, the nuclear disarmer and member of the Committee of 100 was jailed for 14 days by Stroud Magistrates for failing to pay £6 4s. 3d. of his rates. In defence he said he had refused to pay the portion of his rates allocated to civil defence. He had instead paid the money to the charity 'War on Want'. He declared ... It is tragic that ordinary decent people are passively accepting this drift towards mass annihilation... this is my small effort to make it clear that it is a heinous and devilish thing." "Gloucester Citizen, 5 January 1962." 
While in prison on this occasion Laurie produced a leaflet "Why I am in Jail" for local distribution. His eldest daughter, Susan (aged 14), wrote to him in prison to tell him she stood in Stroud bus station for two hours giving out the leaflets.
Stroud protester answered.
Mr Harold Macmillan, the Prime Minister has replied to a protest made by Mr Laurence Hislam of Stroud against American nuclear tests. Mr Hislam, the Stroud CND member, who recently fasted for 99 hours, had sent the protest, with a petition signed by 1,000 people of Stroud, both to the Prime Minister and President Kennedy against the tests. The reply quotes an extract from The Times "In particular the President and the Prime Minister ... reaffirmed their regret that the Soviet Government had not been willing to join in an effective treaty which would end testing..." Mr Hislam commented "In my view, the responsibility for our policy - based as it is on a threat to annihilate mankind - cannot be passed on to the Russians." ("Gloucester Citizen, 9 May 1962")
Local demonstrators expelled by E. Berlin police.
Five "ban the bomb" demonstrators were yesterday expelled by Communist secret police after they had distributed leaflets in East Berlin. At her Brownshill, Stroud home Mrs Laurence Hislam, wife of one of the demonstrators told reporters that she had not heard of her husband's success in penetrating East Berlin "but they were expecting to get over the border and I thought they would creep in somehow" "Gloucester Citizen", 15 April 1963
Ban-bomb man goes bald as Hiroshima protest.
Nuclear disarmament campaigner Laurence Hislam (54) had his head shaved bald today - the anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He said "I have done this as an unavoidable reminder to other people that they implicitly or explicitly accept the possibility of the use of the hydrogen bomb" He is keeping his beard and moustache "If I had them off too there would be the danger of my friends not recognising me in the street" His wife and five children he said had "come to accept pretty well anything I do". After the shearing Mr Hislam went to Stroud Roman Catholic Church for meditation before walking the 5 miles home to Brownshill. "Stroud News and Journal, 6 August 1963"
Mr. Hislam has the Yul Brynner.
"To mark the guilt of Hiroshima Mr Hislam a ban-the-bomb campaigner had his head shaved to remind people of the horrors of the bomb. Yesterday, he and members of Stroud CND staged a fast to mark the anniversary." "Gloucester Citizen 7 August 1964"
Walk to Rome.
In autumn 1962, Hislam made plans for a pilgrimage to Rome. He had high hopes for the Second Vatican Council which was due to open in October, as Pope John XXIII was known as a man of peace. He began the 1,200 mile walk from his home in Gloucestershire and was joined in London by a younger companion, Neil Snelders. Before they left London an interview by ITV was broadcast on the 6 pm news. They had very little money, although some support from PAX, relying on the charity of the church (not always forthcoming) for accommodation along the route. Hislam wore a placard (re-made in French and then Italian along the way) setting out their purpose and there were many instances of interest and generosity from members of the public as well as occasional hostility. Laurie wrote regular reports for "Peace News" and kept a diary, completed each evening. The first entry states his purpose:
"Pilgrimage from Stroud to Rome,via London with the intention of seeking a Private Audience with Pope John XXlll asking him whether he does not think the time has come when the scandal of Catholics and other Christians (not to mention others not adhering to Christianity) preparing for nuclear war, and supporting policies based upon the readiness to prosecute such a war, should be condemned, and all individual Christians be instructed that by so doing they are acting contrary to the teaching of Christ."
He left home 1 October and reached Rome on 1 December. There followed much frustration with Vatican bureaucrats as the Pope was not in good health. He remained in Rome until 23 December and despite many meetings with Archbishop Roberts and others he was not able to arrange a Private Audience. He put what he wanted to say in a letter, accompanied by a petition from PAX, and was assured that this had been "sent to the Pope". He hoped for a reply, which did not happen, and he was not fully convinced that his letter had actually reached Pope John. A note in his diary towards the end of his time in Rome encapsulates his feelings of frustration and his own very personal commitment: ""It is impossible it seems to convey to anyone the fact that one is really serious in one's intentions. It is difficult for anyone to grasp the idea that one might actually sacrifice something to achieve a step towards peace."
On 11 April 1963 Pope John XXIII issued his final papal encyclical "Pacem in Terris" ("Peace on Earth"), on nuclear non-proliferation but not the full condemnation of nuclear weapons that Laurie had hoped for.
Untimely death.
Laurie Hislam was killed on 26 August 1966 in a car crash in France while driving his family home from holiday in Yugoslavia. The death of the "Ban the bomb marcher" was reported in the "Gloucester Citizen", "Western Daily Press", "Stroud News and Journal", "Cheltenham Echo", "Daily Sketch", "Bristol Evening Post" and also mentioned on the BBC News. An obituary by David Stayt, of Gloucester CND, appeared in the "Stroud News and Journal", "Peace News" and "Sanity" (CND). A 'Personal Comment', written by John Papworth for "Peace News" September 1966 gives his thoughts on Hislam's character: "Laurie was always ready to pursue an argument as far a it would go … his talk was dominated by his concern for peace …. many highly individual attempts to jolt people into a flicker of awareness of the war peril."

Vladimir Lenin monument, Azov

Vladimir Lenin monument in Azov () is a monument dedicated the founder of USSR Vladimir Lenin which is situated in the city of Azov, Rostov Oblast, Russia. It is officially declared as an object of cultural heritage of regional importance.
History.
The monument was opened on 30 April 1978, several days after the 108th anniversary Lenin's birthday. When the monument was being constructed, at the same time, the square around it was also being renovated according to the project of the city's chief architect Vladimir Fomenko and the chairman of the Azov city executive committee Anatoly Ivanov.
The authors of the monument were sculptor Yuri Orekhov and architects Vladimir Peterburzhtsev and Alexander Stepanov. The monument is presented in the form of a half-figure (which is not typical for other monuments dedicated to Lenin) carved from natural Azerbaijani granite. The total height of the monument is 10.8 meters: the height of the rostrum is 5.3 meters, and the height of the pedestal is 5.5 meters. The pedestal is lined with polished granite.
General work on the construction of the monument was conducted by a team of stonemasons from Russian Monumental Art Association, Moscow and by workers of the Azov city repair and construction management. The metal letters on the pedestal were made by the Azov Optical and Mechanical Plant.

Doug Taft

Douglas Taft (9 March 1926 – 29 September 1987) was an English footballer who made six appearances in the Football League playing as a centre forward for Derby County in the 1940s. He was on the books of Wolverhampton Wanderers without playing league football for the club, and also played non-league football for clubs including Gresley Rovers, Chelmsford City, Bedford Town, Peterborough United, Kettering Town, Rugby Town and Hinckley Athletic, where he was player-manager.
Life and career.
Taft was born in Leicester in 1926. He served in the Army during the Second World War, and was playing football for Gresley Rovers when he caught the attention of First Division club Derby County. He was of powerful build, tall and weighing . After demobilisation, he signed professional forms in November 1947, and began his career playing for the reserve team in the Central League. He made his first-team debut in the league match away to Stoke City on 11 December 1948, deputising for Jack Stamps who failed a late fitness test, and scored the opening goal after 14 minutes, but Derby went on to lose 4–2. He returned to the team for the Christmas fixtures against reigning champions Arsenal, and created the goal with which Derby opened the scoring in a 2–1 win at the Baseball Ground:
Taft kept his place for a few weeks, a period that included Derby's first three matches in the 1948–49 FA Cup. The "Star Green 'Un" thought he played his best game for Derby in the fifth-round win against Cardiff City and had developed a good understanding with inside left Billy Steel. However, Stamps returned to the side, and Taft made no more first-team appearances.
He was one of 33 professionals placed on Derby's retained list, but did not remain with the club for long. In July 1949, as part of a deal that took Wolves' Les Mynard to Derby and in the same week as he celebrated his wedding to Norma Allwood, Taft signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers as backup to Jesse Pye. He soon suffered a knee injury that required surgery, which deprived him of a chance to play for the first team when Pye was injured in January. When fit again, Taft was still unable to break into the first team, so he requested a transfer, and was listed at a fee reported as £5,000. There was interest from Second Division clubs, but eventually Taft signed for a Southern League club, Chelmsford City. His season was soon disrupted by injury and the need for a second cartilage operation, but he stayed on for a second season.
Ahead of the 1952–53 season, he was still on Wolves' retained list at a fee reported as £10,000. He reportedly came close to signing for Biggleswade Town of the United Counties League, but instead joined another Southern League club, Bedford Town. Because Ronnie Rooke, the club's player-manager, was established at centre forward, Taft played at inside left for Bedford. He ended the season with 29 goals from 53 appearances in all competitions, 22 from 40 in the Southern League, as the team finished third. The club wanted him to stay on, but the directors wanted to reduce the wage bill, and Taft was one of several professionals to refuse the terms offered.
He signed for Midland League club Peterborough United. He made a spectacular start: he scored in the opening fixture, then contributed five goals to a 9–1 win against Gainsborough Trinity, and a hat-trick in his sixth match, against York City's reserves, took his total to twelve in the first month of the season. His scoring rate slowed, but he finished the season as the Midland League's top scorer with 42 goals. He captained the team in the 1954–55 season, but his goalscoring deserted him, and he played much of the season at right half. He was given a free transfer at the end of the season, and returned to Southern League football with Kettering Town. A season later, he moved on to captain Rugby Town of the Birmingham &amp; District League, and "served his side quietly and efficiently by nearly always being in the open space when the ball has come out his side of the centre. That he has not scored more goals is almost entirely due the fact that he favoured a berth well back to help the halves and the wingers." He moved on to Hinckley Athletic as player-manager, a post he resigned in January 1959.
Taft died in Derby in 1987 at the age of 61.

Marielle Franco

Marielle Franco (, born Marielle Francisco da Silva; 27 July 1979 – 14 March 2018) was a Brazilian politician, sociologist, feminist, socialist, and human rights activist. After earning a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University, she served as a city councillor of the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro for the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) from January 2017 until her death.
On 14 March 2018, while in a car after delivering a speech, Franco and her driver were shot multiple times and killed by two murderers in another vehicle, north of Rio de Janeiro. Franco had been an outspoken critic of police brutality and extrajudicial killings, as well as the February 2018 federal intervention by Brazilian president Michel Temer in the state of Rio de Janeiro which resulted in the deployment of the army in police operations. In March 2019, two former police officers were arrested and charged with the murder of Marielle Franco.
Early life.
Franco was raised in Maré, a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro, where she also resided for most of her life, and began to work to contribute to the household income in 1990 when she was 11 years old. Marielle gave birth to her first and only child in 1998 when she was 19 years old. Franco raised her daughter without the father's help and worked as a pre-school teacher on a minimum wage.
In 2004, Franco, who throughout her career fought for LGBT rights, started a romantic relationship with Mônica Benício. In 2017, the couple decided to move in together in the Tijuca neighborhood with Luyara, Marielle's daughter. Their wedding was scheduled for the end of 2018.
Education.
In 2000, she began her pre-university studies. Following the death of a friend from a stray bullet in 2000, Franco began working in human rights activism.
In 2002, she entered the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro on a scholarship and continued working and raising her daughter as she worked towards a degree in social sciences. She subsequently earned a master's degree in public administration from the Fluminense Federal University. Her master's thesis (titled "UPP: The Reduction of the Favela to Three Letters") concerns the law enforcement program to retake control of Rio's favelas from gangs.
Political career.
Beginning in 2007, Franco worked as a consultant for the state representative Marcelo Freixo, and she coordinated the state legislature's Committee for the Defense of Human Rights and Citizenship. She also worked for civil society organizations, including the Brazil Foundation and the Maré Center for Solidarity Studies and Action.
In 2016, Franco ran for a seat on the Rio de Janeiro city council in the municipal elections. As a black woman and single mother from the favelas, Franco positioned herself as a representative and defender of poor black women and people from the favelas. With over 46,500 votes, Franco was one of the 51 representatives elected, receiving the fifth highest vote total out of more than 1,500 candidates.
As a city council member, Franco fought against gender violence, for reproductive rights, and for the rights of favela residents. She chaired the Women's Defense Commission and formed part of a four-person committee that monitored the federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro. Working with the Rio de Janeiro Lesbian Front, Franco presented a bill to create a day of lesbian visibility in Rio de Janeiro in August 2017, but the bill was defeated by a vote of 19–17.
Final days and assassination.
On 13 March 2018, Franco spoke out on Twitter against the police violence in Rio de Janeiro: “Another homicide of a young man that could be credited to the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church when he was killed. How many others will have to die for this war to end?" ()
The next day, Franco attended a round-table discussion titled "Young Black Women Moving [Power] Structures" (). Less than two hours after leaving the round-table, she and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, were fatally shot by two men who were driving another car. The men fired nine shots at them, four of which struck Franco – three in the head and one in the neck. Franco's press officer was next to her in the back seat and was injured, but survived.
Marcelo Freixo, a Rio de Janeiro legislative assembly member from PSOL who came to the scene shortly after hearing of her killing, determined that the bullets had been directed at her in a clear execution. According to the Rio de Janeiro police, the direction of the nine shots supports the hypothesis that Franco was assassinated. The bullets that killed Franco are from a batch bought by the federal police in Brasília in 2006; Minister of Public Security Raul Jungmann later said that they were stolen from a post office storage facility in Paraíba, but the ministry subsequently retracted this explanation after the Post Office publicly denied it.
In January 2019, police arrested Ronald Paulo Alves Pereira and issued a warrant for Adriano Magalhães da Nóbrega, both suspects in Franco's assassination. Each suspect received honors from president Jair Bolsonaro's son Flávio Bolsonaro in the early 2000s. Nóbrega's wife and mother were still being employed in Flávio Bolsonaro's office in 2018.
In March 2019, police arrested two suspects, former members of the military police allegedly tied to a vigilante militia, for the murder. Prior to their arrest, both suspects had pictures taken with now President Jair Bolsonaro, and one was his neighbor at a luxury apartment complex in Rio. In November 2019, a number of Brazilian media outlets reported that police were investigating possible ties of President Bolsonaro's second son, Carlos, to the case.
Reactions to assassination.
Thousands took to the streets in coordinated protests across Brazil, and both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned her killing.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald, whose husband David Miranda was a fellow City Council member at the time of her assassination and was a close personal friend of Franco's, listed what he referred to as the "most important subjects to cover" regarding Franco's assassination stating:
Her relentless and brave activism against the most lawless police battalions, her opposition to military intervention, and, most threateningly of all, her growing power as a black, gay woman from the favela seeking not to join Brazil’s power structure, but to subvert it.
The double murder of Marielle and her driver Anderson was the subject of condemnation across the political spectrum in Brazil.

Kristy Stratton

Kristy Stratton (born 26 January 1995) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Collingwood Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW).
State football.
In 2014, Stratton won the Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL) Division 1 best and fairest, while playing at Knox. After rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament, she underwent a knee construction in 2015. This surgery and advice from the surgeon prompted her to give up athletics and focus on football. Stratton played for Box Hill Hawks in the VFL Women's (VFLW). In 2017, she only managed to play seven games due to tearing her lateral meniscus.
AFL Women's career.
Stratton was drafted by Collingwood with the club's fifth selection and the 21st overall in the 2017 AFL Women's draft. Joining Collingwood, she teamed-up with Melissa Kuys who captained her when they played for Box Hill Hawks. She made her debut in a 14-point win over the Brisbane at Moreton Bay Central Sports Complex in round 6 of the 2018 season. Collingwood re-signed Stratton for the 2019 season during the trade period in June 2018. Midway through the season, she suffered another injury, this time breaking her hand. In April 2019, Stratton re-committed to Collingwood for the 2020 season, along with Jordyn Allen, Emma Grant, and Sharni Layton. In April 2021, Stratton was delisted by Collingwood. Following her delisting, she re-joined Box Hill Hawks.
Personal life.
Stratton is the younger sister of champion athlete Brooke Stratton. Both of them attended Caulfield Grammar School in Wheelers Hill, Victoria and were active athletes, with Brooke holding many records and Kristy holding the record for 80 metres hurdles in the under-14 category. She grew up as a Collingwood supporter.

Henry Fetherstonhaugh

Sir Henry Fetherstonhaugh, 2nd Baronet (22 December 1754 – 24 October 1846), known as Harry, was an English aristocrat.
The son of Matthew Fetherstonhaugh, 1st Baronet (of the Fetherstonhaugh baronets), he was the Member of Parliament for Portsmouth from 1782 to 1796, but never once spoke in the House of Commons, and has been described as a "witless playboy".
He made the Grand Tour in 1775-76 but passed most of it in sexual and hunting adventures. Like his parents and uncle 25 years earlier, he was painted by Pompeo Batoni in Rome, and later employed Humphry Repton to lay out the gardens to his country manor, Uppark.
Sir Harry was a good friend of the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), who stayed at Uppark during the mid-1780s. He took the teenaged Emma Hamilton as a mistress to live with him at Uppark in 1780 and to entertain his guests at the many parties he hosted, but rejected her when she became pregnant with his child in 1781. A frequent guest at Uppark, Charles Greville, took her in as his mistress on condition that the child, Emma Carew, was fostered out.
On 12 Sept. 1825, when over 70, Fetherstonhaugh married Mary Ann Bullock, his head dairy maid, aged 18 or 21, and upon his death left his entire estate to her. After her husband's death Mary Ann continued living at Uppark with her sister, Frances (b.1817).

14th British Academy Games Awards

The 14th British Academy Video Game Awards hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts on 12 April 2018 at Troxy honoured the best video games of 2017. It was hosted by Dara Ó Briain, who had previously hosted the 12th ceremony in 2016.
Category Changes.
For the 13th ceremony, one new category was introduced. The Game Beyond Entertainment Award will be awarded to celebrate games that have a profound social impact. An official statement from BAFTA explains that the category will award "the best game that capitalises on the unique and maturing medium of games to deliver a transformational experience beyond pure entertainment - whether that is to raise awareness through empathy and emotional impact, to engage with real world problems, or to make the world a better place. While BAFTA has long been rewarding these games for their creative excellence, entries in this new category will be judged solely on content: its emotional impact, thematic fit and innovative use of the medium to explore and deliver impactful messages".
Nominations.
On 21 February 2018, it was announced that Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine Productions, would be awarded the Fellowship award, the highest honour BAFTA can bestow. The nominations for other awards were announced on 15 March 2018.

Abdulfattah Adam

Abdulfattah Adam (, born 1 January 1995) is a Saudi Arabian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Pro League side Al-Nassr, and the Saudi Arabia national team.
Club career.
Adam was first scouted when he played in a friendly match against Al-Jeel during the summer of 2014. Al-Jeel were impressed by him and Abdullah Darwish, the manager at the time, insisted on Adam participating in the team's training. Adam officially signed for Al-Jeel during the 2014 summer transfer window.
Al-Jeel.
Abdulfattah ended his first season with Al-Jeel scoring 10 goals during the course of the 2014–15 season helping them to a sixth-placed finish.

During his last season, the 2016–17 season, Abdulfattah Adam finished the season with 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions. He also finished the season as the league's top scorer for the second consecutive season.

Al-Hazem.
On May 18, 2017, Abdulfattah Adam left Al-Jeel and joined Al-Hazem on a free transfer. Adam started the season poorly and scored just once in his first eight games. However, his form soon began to improve scoring 7 goals in 8 appearances. He left the club during the 2018 winter transfer window and ended his time with Al-Hazem with 17 appearances and 8 goals.
Al-Taawoun.

Pietro Correr (patriarch)

Pietro Correr (c. 1235/40 – c. 1302) was an Italian Roman Catholic clergyman of the Correr family of Venice.
Life.
The son of Angelo Correr, a senator of Venice, Pietro first appears in the historical record in 1265 as pieve to the church of Sant'Aponal. In 1267 he appears as primicerius of St Mark's Basilica and in 1275 as rector of San Maurizio. Another document of 1268 shows him to have been a canon in Verona.
On the death of Tomaso Franco the relevant cathedral chapter was called upon to elect his successor as bishop of Castello, but it split between Correr's supporters and the backers of Bartolomeo I Querini, a cathedral canon and papal chaplain. The conflict continued and see remained vacant for a long time. Correr looked like winning it but eventually in 1274 pope Gregory X invalidated the election and unilaterally made Querini bishop. The anti-Correr faction in the chapter had probably fallen back on an old law that members of the chapter of St Mark's could not hold titles in the diocese of Castello - Correr was still primicerius and thus was technically still part of that chapter. In 1274 he acquired some funds from Aldinello of Bassano and the following year he attacked Alidnello's son Pietro. The dispute lasted three years and the town council of Bassano had to intervene. Several other documents also show he was still acting as primicerius at this time.
In summer 1286 he was elected Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, an honorary title since the Latin Empire had been dissolved after the Byzantine Empire's reconquest of the city in 1261. The Latin Empire had sent western clergy to replace Orthodox ones, but the former were expelled after the reconquest. Even so, the see technically continued, with a chapter of canons electing a patriarch. Correr's election was confirmed by Pope Honorius IV and he was consecrated by Latino Malabranca Orsini, bishop of Ostia. It is unclear if Correr remained in Venice or went east to run the patriarchate's remaining possessions of Crete and at Negroponte - it may have been the former, since on 10 January 1296 he was given some properties in San Pietro di Castello by Cecilia, wife of Matteo Belegno. Some sources name him Archbishop of Candia but this is an error, possibly arising from Pope Boniface VIII's union of that diocese with the patriarchate in 1302, which occurred after Correr's death.

OASIS International

OASIS International is an American company that manufactures drinking water coolers, non-refrigerated water fountains, bottled water dispensers, and dehumidifiers in 80 countries in North America, Asia, and the EMEA regions. Its head office is in Columbus, Ohio and it has production facilities in Mexico and Poland. It also has its European headquarters in Ireland and a permanent office in Shenzhen, China.
The company's history dates to 1910, when it was founded as the "D.A. Ebinger Sanitary Manufacturing Company," and later known as "EBCO." It renamed itself "Oasis" after its popular product lines in 1996.
History.
The company was founded as the D.A. Ebinger Sanitary Manufacturing Company in 1910 with its first warehouse located at 400 West Rich Street in Columbus, Ohio manufacturing toilet, sanitary fixtures, and plumbing supplies. After a series of changes in its product categories, it renamed Ebco Manufacturing Company in 1935 before developing into new categories such as water fountains, coolers, dehumidifiers, as well as refrigeration parts.
The company began branding these products under the "OASIS" name in the 1940s. By 1950, it had employed 200 employees and had begun a major expansion of its facilities with a windowless air-conditioned factory in 1953. This was after expanding into the dehumidifier and juice dispenser product categories to a total of 290,000-sqft in 1960 at 265 North Hamilton Road. 
In 1992, a 30,000-sqft manufacturing facility in Ireland was established for the production and distribution of its products in the European and the Middle Eastern market before it was renamed Oasis Corporation later in 1996 due to the popularity of its Oasis line of products.
By the 1990s, it had achieved having the majority of the market share of the bottled water coolers sold in the industry. It expanded to a new manufacturing facility in Poland in 2001 and subsequently acquired Sunroc Corporation in 2003, then the third largest bottled water cooler manufacturer, before having its assets acquired in 2005 by Patriarch Partners due to competition from lower-cost Asian competitors. It was subsequently renamed to OASIS International.
Products.
Water coolers.
The company manufactures bottled as well as point-of-use water coolers. It holds several patents in water cooler and dispenser technology including the invention of the disposable bottled cooler water dispenser. Popular products include the Kalix line of water coolers as well as the Aquapointe and Versafiller line of bottle fillers.
It also manufacturers accessories such as water filters and water filtration systems and has partnered with Aquisense on a disinfection solution for water coolers through the use of UV LED filtration.
Dehumidifiers.
Since 1960, the company expanded into a new product category of dehumidifiers for commercial purposes and has been manufacturing them ever since after scaling up to a new factory in 1953.
Smart technology.
In recent years, Oasis has addressed environmental concerns of plastic pollution with a focus on eco-friendly products by introducing bottle filler units at airports with bottle counting functionality. It had also expanded its products with smart water coolers. It began collaborating with Flowdaq, and Ireland-based startup and Activewhere, a Portugal-based industry route management developer, in the hardware development of bottled coolers with IoT functionality running on the Sigfox network.

UNE PIECE

UNE PIECE is an Australian retailer of women's swimwear, founded by Carly Brown in 2016. The brand's signature product is a one-piece swimsuit with long sleeves; the upper half of the suit resembling and functioning as a rashie. The suit provides its wearer with UPF50+ sun protection for their arms and back, and a zippered front offers a selectable amount of protection for the chest. The "Original Sexie Rashie" design attracted favourable review in major fashion publications including "Vogue", "Elle", "Marie Claire", and "Vanity Fair", and won Brown second place in the Queensland University of Technology's Bluebox annual innovation challenge for 2017. Brown later named the "Huffington Post", London "Times", and "Vogue" reviews as giving her a sense of validation.
The suits are manufactured from a 4½ times chlorine resistant Italian fabric and feature 28 pieces in their construction (compared to four in a typical rashie). This structure is intended to "flatter and conceal", as a reviewer in "The Times" put it. The design went through eleven iterations before being finalised and is manufactured in a wide range of sizes: (Australian) sizes 6 to 18. The broad range of sizes was a deliberate choice by Brown to make the product as accessible to as many women as practical, stating in an interview "It's not fair just because you aren't a size 8 or 10, you can't get access to beautiful products".
Prior to founding UNE PIECE, Brown was a marketing manager for The Coca-Cola Company and Revlon in London, and a senior marketing manager for Uber in Australia. The idea for the UNE PIECE design came to Brown when she was holidaying in Europe. While undertaking market research for the product, she amassed a waiting list of over 500 buyers, convincing her of the product's viability. The initial production run sold out within a week of availability with future buyers facing a wait of over a month for the second run. She left her position at Uber to work full-time on UNE PIECE in July 2016.
The "Original Sexie Rashie" design was later joined by two variations with back zips in place of the front zip: the "Surfe Sexie Rashie" with a higher neck, and the "Twist Sexie Rashie" with a low-cut neck and twist detailing on the front. UNE PIECE also manufactures a conventional, halterneck one-piece swimsuit based on their "Twist Sexie Rashie" design.

Kreiensen station

Kreiensen station is a Keilbahnhof ("wedge station") in Kreiensen in the German state of Lower Saxony and along with Einbeck-Salzderhelden station one of two stations in the town of Einbeck.
History.
The first station in the Duchy of Brunswick was established in Kreiensen in 1854. It consisted of station buildings, outbuildings and goods sheds, as well as an extension with ancillary facilities. It became more congested with the opening of the Altenbeken–Kreiensen railway in 1865. Following the opening of the Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway of the Duchy of Brunswick and the Vienenburg–Goslar railway in 1866, new construction at the station began in 1886. Reliefs of the Brunswick Lion on the east side and a Prussian eagle on the west side reflect its joint use by Hanover and Brunswick—the Kingdom of Hanover was located directly north and south. Master builder Richard Herzig had 35,000 yellow and red facing bricks and 110,000 common bricks delivered.
Since the tracks divided Kreiensen into two areas, a pedestrian bridge was built. It was designed according to the construction principle of Max Möller with fish-bellied support ribs at spans of 124 m and 58 m.
In 1923, there was a rear-end collision between two trains travelling at night and 47 people were killed.
In 1956, the world's first track-plan signal box was installed by Siemens. It was able to take over the tasks of three old mechanical signal boxes. Two dispatchers each served half of the station, which was only connected on the south side by three tracks. An electronic interlocking that was remotely controlled by the control centre in Hanover was put into operation on 13 November 2011.
The platforms and canopies were renovated in 2014.
Entrance building.
The entrance building was built for the Hanoverian Southern Railway to plans by Hubert Stier in 1886-89. This building from the Wilhelminist period is a brick building with facades covered by tiles. Other elements of shaped stone are found in arched profiles and cornices. Formal design tools are used sparingly on the facades. The cladding with ochre-coloured ceramic tiles is complemented with pillars covered with various terracotta reliefs. Plinths and cornices are made of sandstone. Due to its external monumentality, the building does not reflect the townscape, but instead stresses its importance as a railway junction. It contains a "Fürstenzimmer" ("prince's room"), which was the location of a meeting between Otto von Bismarck and Tsar Alexander III of Russia in 1889. 
It was due to be sold at auction by DB Station &amp; Service in September 2016.
Operations.
The operations include freight and passenger trains. The station is a railway junction. It is served mainly by Deutsche Bahn, NordWestBahn and Metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft. It is used in freight operations by the Ilmebahn for shunting. It is also the location of a bus station of the "Verkehrsverbund Süd-Niedersachsen".
In addition, a single train pair operated by DB Regio Nord runs via Bad Gandersheim, Seesen and Salzgitter-Bad to Brunswick Hbf in the morning.

Ángel Ferrant

Ángel Ferrant Vázquez (Madrid 1890 – 1961) was an avant-garde Spanish sculptor associated with surrealism and kinetic art.
Biography and works.
Son of the painter Alejandro Ferrant, he studied sculpture at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in Madrid, the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and at sculptor Aniceto Marinas’ studio. His first works fit into the academic realism of the new century and have hints of an aesthetic trend called tremendismo which uses realism to shock. The most outstanding one is "La cuesta de la vida" (Museo del Prado) for which he won the second medal at the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1910. In 1913 he travelled to Paris where he came into contact with futurism and although he wasn't a futurist in the strict sense, the influence of Marinetti, with whom he had an epistolary relationship, contributed to the evolution of his sculpture.
When he obtained the position of sculpture and casting teacher, he was assigned to the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in A Coruña. He lived there for two years and then, in 1920 he was transferred to the Escola de la Llotja in Barcelona. He stayed there until 1934, when he established himself permanently as a teacher at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in Madrid.
First contact with the avant-garde.
In Barcelona, he approached the noucentisme and avant-garde artists, whose influence is shown in "La escolar", for which he won the first prize at the National Competition of Sculpture in 1926. The Junta de Ampliación de Estudios gave him a scholarship and in 1927 he travelled to Vienna in order to update the pedagogical methods of the teaching of sculpture.
During these years he spent in Barcelona, he exhibited his works in various art galleries and with different groups, as for instance, the I Exposición de la Sociedad de Artistas Ibéricos, in which he presented two nudes influenced by primitive art, the Saló dels Evolucionistes, the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc, and the Asociación de Escultores and Amigos de las Artes Nuevas (ADLAN.), a group akin to surrealism founded in 1931 that had Ángel Ferrant as a very active member. In 1936 he participated in the Exposición Logicofobista in Barcelona, which was part of the surrealistic trend. His student Eduald Serra was also involved in this exposition. During these years, Ferrant started his investigation about objects, trying out new artistic material within the aesthetic of the "objet trouvé". He also made contact with Alexander Calder, which had his "Circo en miniatura" exhibited by Amigos de las Nuevas Artes.
The Civil War and the Artistic Treasure Committee.
When the war began, he signed the “Manifiesto de la Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas para la Defensa de la Cultura” published in the "La voz" newspaper on July 30, 1936. On early 1937, Ángel joined the Seizure, Protection and Rescue of the Artistic Treasure Committee which was set up on December 15, 1936, and had Roberto Fernández Balbuena as president and his brother Alejandro Ferrant as chairperson. One of his responsibilities as technical assistant was to organise photographic files from all Committee's works. He was also named provisional director of the Modern Art Museum around that time, since the former director Ricardo Gutiérrez Abascal moved to Valencia, and president of the Artistic Treasure Section of the Central Board of the Archives, Libraries and Artistic Treasure. These were positions that could truly exercised since the museum remained closed and the Central Board was an empty superstructure. Ángel was arrested in the Committee units by agents from the Servicio de Información Militar (Military Information Service) or SIM of the Ejército del Centro on May 27. The same agents which the night before arrested the architect Francisco Ordeig (responsible of the stores that the Junta de Incautación had in the Church of San Francisco el Grande), one of his sons and also the public employees from the Committee and members of the National Republican Guard who were in charge of the custody of the art works that were there. There was an accusation on these members because of connivance with the enemy. All Ferrant brothers were released on May 30, after the intervention of Fernández Balbuena and other colleagues from the Committee. They warned about exaggerations and forced interpretations of declarations heard by confidants in the accusations made by officers of the brigade. Apparently, there was no other reason for that arrest but their friendship with Ordeig, who was finally judged in Barcelona one year later.
Ángel was appointed as spokesperson of the Committee that was in charge of the different town tours and seizures in the center of the area, among others. In January 1938, after Fernández Balbuena's designation as representative of the Dirección General de Bellas Artes in Madrid and deputy director of the Museo del Prado, Ángel Ferrant was named president of the Artistic Treasure Board in Madrid. Its reticences to some officials from the Ministry requests and to the Fine Arts management were causing continuous arguments. Ángel presented his resignation in March, but soon he canceled it because he was unwilling to move "The Descent from the Cross," of Rogier van der Weyden, to Valencia. In April 1938 Ángel Ferrant was asked to go to Barcelona, where he stayed until June leaving as responsible of the Committee Matilde López Serrano, a Francoist agent of the SIPM (Servicio de Información y Policía Militar). On September 6 those in charge of the Ministry of Finance, to which the competences of the Artistic Treasure were transferred, proceeded to reshuffle the Committees, headed by the civil governors. Ferrant became the technical assistant and had no executive functions.
Post-war.
After the war, Ferrant and his brother were sued by the Duke of Valencia, whose properties had been saved thanks to the Committee of Madrid. In April, after facing disciplinary proceedings, Ferrant filed an exculpatory statement, in which he explained his actions towards the Committee. In July, Pedro Muguruza, Commissioner-general of the Servicio de Defensa del Patrimonio Artístico Nacional, submitted a report to the Military Tribunal of Officials explaining the Committee's role in the preservation of the patrimony in Madrid. After this dispute he retook the artistic creativity he had left during the war. In this context were highly significant the series of terracotta reliefs of "Tauromaquia" (Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid), dating from 1939, in which Ferrant returns to figurative art with a budget unconnected to the academic field.
In 1943 he was commissioned by the architects Durán de Cottes and López Izquierdo in collaborating in a set of sculptures designed for the façade of the Teatro Albéniz in Madrid, as a reinterpretation of the façades of the Spanish Baroque architecture. His task was to sculpt eleven wooden statues, which by a simple crankshaft mechanism and a small motor would move their jointed parts (they would appear playing guitar, fanning themselves, moving their torso, etc.). The statues could be seen in the façade until 1983. That year they were exhibited and, from then onwards, they were kept in the theatre's foyer. For economic reasons, Ferrant took different orders, such as some of the reliefs of the Descubrimiento column in La Rábida (Huelva), but he also started working again in "objetos hallados" - shells, stones, sticks - assembled in structures of “non-utilitarian expression”.
In 1948 he met the German artist Mathias Goeritz and his Escuela de Altamira, which promoted working with stone or clay objects in which human figures would be outlined. Ferrant and Goeritz published "Figuras del mar", a book with texts in German and drawings made by Ferrant. In 1949, he exhibited his "móviles", similar to Calder and his sculpture "Estáticas". In 1960, Ferrant won the special sculpture award in the XXX Bienal of Valencia.

Platform economy

The platform economy is economic and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such platforms are typically online sales or technology frameworks. By far the most common type are "transaction platforms", also known as "digital matchmakers". Examples of transaction platforms include Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, and Baidu. A second type is the "innovation platform", which provides a common technology framework upon which others can build, such as the many independent developers who work on Microsoft's platform.
Forerunners to contemporary digital economic platforms can be found throughout history, especially in the second half of the 20th century. Yet it was only in the year 2000 that the "platform" metaphor started to be widely used to describe digital matchmakers and innovation platforms. Especially after the financial crises of 2008, companies operating with the new "platform business model" have swiftly come to control an increasing share of the world's overall economic activity, sometimes by disrupting traditional business. Examples include the decline of BlackBerry and Nokia due to competition from platform companies, the closing down of Blockbuster due to competition from the Netflix platform, or the many other brick and mortar retailers that have closed in part due to competition from Amazon and other online retailers. In 2013, platform expert Marshall Van Alstyne observed that three of the top five companies in the world used the platform business model. However, traditional businesses need not always be harmed by platforms; they can even benefit by creating their own or making use of existing third-party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture "81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years." In the year 2000 there were only a handful of large firms that could be described as platform companies. As of 2016, there were over 170 platform companies valued at US$1 billion or more. The creation and usage of digital platforms is also increasing in the government and NGO sectors.
The rise of platforms has been met by a mixed response from commentators. Many have been enthusiastic, arguing that platforms can improve productivity, reduce costs, reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, provide flexibility and accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Arguments against platforms include that they may worsen technological unemployment, that they contribute to the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection, that they can worsen declining tax revenues, and that excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. Since the early 2010s, the platform economy has been the subject of many reviews by academic groups and NGOs, by national governments and by transnational organisations like the EU. Early reviews were generally against the imposition of heavy regulation for the platform economy. Since 2016, and especially in 2017, some jurisdictions began to take a more interventionist approach. Platform workers often work irregular and long hours, putting them at risk of cardiovascular diseases. 
Platform definition.
The 'platform' metaphor has long been used in a variety of ways. In the context of "platform economy", 21st-century usage of the word platform sometimes refers solely to online matchmakers such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit etc. Academic work and some business books often use the term in a wider sense, to include non-digital matchmakers like a business park or a nightclub, and also to other entities whose function is not primarily to support transactions. Platform co-author Alex Moazed explains that “platforms don’t own the means of production, they create the means of connection.” Platforms scholars Professor Carliss Y. Baldwin and Dr C. Jason Woodard have offered a generalised definition of economic platforms where the focus was on the technical side of the platform: "a set of stable components that support variety and evolvability in a system by constraining the linkages among the other components". Woodard and Baldwin have stated that at a high level of abstraction, the architecture of all platforms is the same: a system partitioned into a set of core components with low variety and a complementary set of peripheral components with high variety. Others define it based on the ecosystem perspective where the focus was on the actors around the platform ecosystem (e.g., buyers, sellers). For more discussion of definitions, see the paper "Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions" 
The platform economy.
Also known as the "digital platform" or "online platform economy", the platform economy is economic (the buying, selling and sharing of goods and services ) and social activity facilitated by platforms. Such activity is wider than just commercial transactions, including for example online collaboration on projects such as Wikipedia. While scholarship on platforms sometimes includes discussion of non digital platforms, the term "platform economy" is often used in a sense that encompasses only online platforms.
Relationship with similar digital economy terms.
"Platform economy" is one of a number of terms aiming to capture subsets of the overall economy which are now mediated by digital technology. The terms are used with diverse and sometimes overlapping meanings; some commentators use terms like "sharing economy" or "access economy" in such a broad sense they effectively mean the same thing. Other scholars and commentators do attempt to draw distinctions and use the various terms to delineate different parts of the wider digital economy. The term "platform economy" can be viewed as narrower in scope than "digital economy", but wider in scope than terms like "on demand economy", "sharing economy" or "gig economy". Several scholars have argued that "platform economy" is the preferable term for discussing several aspects of emergent digital phenomena in the early 21st century. 
Digital economy.
The term digital economy generally refers to all or nearly all economic activity relying on computers. As such it can be seen as having the widest scope; encompassing the platform economy, and also digital activities not mediated by actual platforms. For example, economic transactions completed solely by email, or exchanges over EDIs, some of which operate between only two companies so are too closed off to be considered platforms. Some scholars draw a distinction between platforms and earlier websites, excluding even sites such as Craigslist that are used to support economic transactions. Such sites can be considered outside the platform economy, not because they are too closed off, but as they are too open to be classed as platforms.
On-demand economy.
The terms "On-demand" or access economy are sometimes used in a broad sense, to include all activity from transaction platforms, and much else. Some commentators, however, assign the access economy a narrower definition, so that it excludes platforms in the sharing economy. Even when sharing and on-demand platforms are distinguished in this way however, they are still both included in the wider "platform economy".
Sharing economy.
The term sharing economy is also used with a wide range of scopes. According to Rachel Botsman, one of the prominent analysts of the sharing economy, the ‘sharing economy’ as a term has been incorrectly applied to ideas where there is just a model of matching supply with demand, but zero sharing and collaboration involved. There is a fundamental difference between platforms such as Deliveroo, Dashdoor which operates on the basis of meeting instant demand with a constant pool of labour and platforms like BlaBlaCar or Airbnb, which are genuinely built on the sharing of underused assets. So, mere delivery may not qualify as a sharing economy, but it is a mobile-driven version of point-to-point delivery. However, due to the positive connotations of the word "sharing", several platforms that don't involve sharing in the traditional sense of the word have still liked to define themselves as part of the sharing economy. Yet academic and some popular commentators define the sharing economy as only including activity that involves peer to peer transactions; in these narrow definition most of the platform economy is outside of the sharing economy.
Gig economy.
The "Gig economy" refers to various forms of temporary work. The phrase is sometimes used with a broad scope, to include traditional offline temporary and contract work; in that sense, parts of the gig economy are outside the platform economy. In the narrow sense of the phrase, the gig economy refers solely to work mediated by online labour market platforms, for example PeoplePerHour. In this narrow sense, an important sub division is between local and remote gig work. Local gigs require the worker to be present in person as is the case for Uber or most TaskRabbit work. For remote work, also known as the "human cloud", tasks can be done anywhere in the world, as is generally the case with Mechanical Turk or the upwork platform. A 2017 study estimated that worldwide, about 70 million people have registered on the remote labour platforms. The global gig economy, in 2018, generated $204 billion in gross volume (with vehicle for hire services comprising 58% of this value), while this number is expected to grow to $455 billion in 2023. Moreover, surveys yield that 5–9 per cent of adult Internet users in various European countries are involved in working through such platforms weekly, while annual growth rate of the gig platform users is forecasted to be 26 per cent.
The word 'gig' in the term 'gig economy' is suggestive of short-term arrangements typical of a musical event. 
 'Gig' suggests an arrangement similar to musicians being booked for a gig at a particular venue. Such bookings typically have a specified time and won't be long term. As a result, there is no guarantee of repeat bookings, and sometimes no defined method of payment. Parallels exist between etymological meaning of the term related to the musicians’ tasks and the gig economy. For example, gig jobs are classified as contingent work arrangements (in the US-context) rather than full-time or even hourly wage positions. Tasks in the gig economy have been characterized as short, temporary, precarious, and unpredictable. They can also increase accessibility, geographic, and social inclusion in the labour markets, and provide workers with a sense of autonomy.
History.
Pre Internet era.
Businesses operating on some of the principles underpinning contemporary digital platforms have been in operation for millennia. For example, matchmakers who helped men and women find suitable marriage partners operated in China since at least 1100 BC. Grain exchanges from ancient Greece have been compared to contemporary transactional platforms, as have medieval fairs.
Examples of innovation platforms also predate the internet era. Such as geographic regions famous for particular types of production, institutions like Harvard Business School, or the Wintel technology platform that became prominent in the 1980s.
Post Internet.
The viability of large scale transaction platforms was vastly increased due to improvements in communication and connectedness brought about by the Internet. Online market platforms such as Craigslist and eBay were launched in the 1990s. Forerunners to modern social media and online collaboration platforms were also launched in the 1990s, with more successful platforms such as Myspace and Wikipedia emerging in the early 2000s. After the financial crisis of 2007–08, new types of online platforms have risen to prominence, including asset-sharing platforms such as Airbnb, and labour market platforms such as TaskRabbit.
Scholarship and etymology.
According to the OED, the word "platform" has been used since the 16th century, both in the concrete sense to refer to a raised surface, and as a metaphor. However, it was only in the 1990s that the concept of economic platforms began to receive significant attention from academics. In the early 90s, such work tended to focus on innovation or product platforms, defined in a broad sense that did not focus on online activity. Even as late as 1998, there was little focus on transaction platforms, and according to professors David S. Evans and Richard L. Schmalensee, the platform business model as it would be understood in the 21st century was not then recognised by scholars.
The first academic paper to address the platform business model and its application to digital matchmakers is said to be "Platform Competition in Two-Sided Markets" by Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole. An early management research book on platforms was "Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation", by Annabelle Gawer and Michael Cusumano (published in 2002). One of the academics most responsible for connecting those working in the emerging field of platform scholarship was professor Annabelle Gawer; in 2008 she held the first international conference on platforms at London.
The platform business model.
The platform business model involves profiting from a platform that allows two or more groups of users to interact. The model predates the internet; for example, a newspapers with a classified ads section effectively uses the platform business model. The emergence of digital technology has "turbocharged" the model, although it is by no means a sure path to success. While the most successful "born-social" firms can in just a few years achieve multibillion-dollar valuations, along with brand loyalty comparable to the largest traditional companies, most platform business start ups fail. 
Some companies are dedicated to the platform business model; for example, many so-called born-social startups. Other companies can operate their own platform(s) yet still run much of their business on more traditional models. A third set of firms may not run their own platform, but still have a platform strategy for utilising third-party platforms. According to a 2016 survey by Accenture, "81% of executives say platform-based business models will be core to their growth strategy within three years." 
 According to research published by McKinsey in 2019, 84% of traditional firms either owned their own platform or utilised one operated by a third party, while for born digital firms, only 5% lacked a platform strategy. Mckinsey found that firms with a platform presence - either their own or via a third party - enjoyed on average an almost 1.4% higher annual EBIT growth.
Some of the principles governing the operations of matchmaking platforms differ sharply when compared with traditional business models. The selling of products or services is central to most traditional businesses, whereas for transaction platforms, connecting different groups of users is the key focus. For example, a traditional mini cab company sells taxi services, whereas a platform company might connect drivers with passengers. 
Another distinguishing feature of the platform business model is that it emphasises network effects, and the inter-dependence of demand between the different groups that use the platform. So with a platform business, it often makes sense to provide services free to one side of the platform, e.g. to the users of a social media service like Facebook. The cost of this subsidy is more than offset by the extra demand a large user base generates for the revenue generating side(s) of the platform (e.g. advertisers).
According to authors Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson, BlackBerry Limited (formerly RIM) and Nokia lost massive market share to Apple and Google's Android in the early 2010s, as RIM and Nokia were acting as product companies in a world now best suited to platforms. As former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop wrote in 2011 "We’re not even fighting with the right weapons, ... The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems."
Creating a digital platform.
Many books covering the platform economy devote chapters to the challenges involved in creating platforms: both for new platform startups, and for traditional organisations wishing to adopt a platform strategy. Some books are even dedicated just to certain aspects of operating a platform, such as nurturing ecosystems. The work involved in creating a platform can be broadly divided into elements relating to technical functionality and network effects; for many but not all platforms, a great deal of effort also needs to go into the cultivation of ecosystems.
Technical functionality.
Developing the core technical functionality can sometimes be unexpectedly cheap. Courtney Boyd Myers wrote in 2013 that a platform with the core functionality of Twitter could be developed almost for free. A person who already had a laptop could take a $160 Ruby on Rails course, spend about 10 hours writing the code, and then host the Twitter clone on a free Web hosting service. A service that would have a chance of attracting a good user base, however, would need to be developed to at least the level of being a Minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP requires development well beyond a core set of technical functionality, for example, it needs to have a well-polished user experience layer. Boyd Meyers reported estimates that to develop an MVP for a platform like Twitter, the cost could range from $50,000 to $250,000, whereas for a platform needing more complex functionality such as Uber, the cost could range from $1 to $1.5 million. This was in 2013, considerably more has since been spent on technical development for the Uber platform. For other platforms, however, developing the needed technical functionality can be relatively easy. The more difficult task is to attract a large enough user base to ensure long term growth, in other words to create sufficient network effects.
Network effects.
Platforms tend to be a strong beneficiary of network effects; phenomena that can act to increase the value of a platform to all participants as more people join. Sometimes it makes sense for a platform to treat different sides of their network differently. For example, a trading platform relies on both buyers and sellers, and if there is say a shortage of buyers compared to the number of sellers, it might make sense for the platform operator to subsidize buyers, at least temporarily. Perhaps with free access or even with rewards for choosing to use the platform. Sometimes the benefits of network effects can be overestimated, such as with the so-called "grab all the eyeballs fallacy", where a large audience is attracted to a platform, but there proves to be no profitable way to monetise it.
Ecosystems.
In the context of digital platforms, ecosystems are collections of economic actors not controlled by the platform owner, yet who add value in ways that go beyond being a regular user. A common example is the community of independent developers who create applications for a platform, such as the many developers (both individuals and companies) that create apps for Facebook. With Microsoft, significant components of their ecosystem include not just developers, but computer and hardware peripheral manufactures, as well as maintenance and training providers. 
A traditional company embarking on a platform strategy has a head start in creating an ecosystem if they already have a list of partners, alliances and/or resellers. A startup company looking to grow an ecosystem might expose elements of its platform via publicly available APIs. Another approach is to have an easily accessible partnership sign up facility, with the offer of free or subsidised benefits for partners.
Platform owners usually attempt to promote and support all significant actors in their ecosystems, though sometimes there is a competitive relationship between the owner and some of the companies in their ecosystem, very occasionally even a hostile one.
A platform ecosystem can be viewed as an evolving meta-organizational form characterized by enabling platform architecture, supported by a set of platform governance mechanisms necessary to cooperate, coordinate and integrate a diverse set of organizations, actors, activities, and interfaces, resulting in an increased platform value for customers through customized platform services.
Typology.
Scholars have acknowledged platforms are challenging to categorise, due to their variety. A relatively common approach is to divide platforms into four types, based on the principle ways they add utility, rather than being concerned with which particular sectors they serve. These four types are transaction, innovation, integrated, and investment. Other ways to categorize digital platforms are discussed in "Digital Platforms: A Review and Future Directions" 
Transaction platforms.
Also known as two-sided markets, multisided markets, or digital match making firms, transaction platforms are by far the most common type of platform. These platforms often facilitate various forms of online buying and selling, though sometimes most or all transactions supported by the platform will be free of charge.
Innovation platforms.
Innovation platforms provide a technological foundation, often including a set of common standards, upon which an ecosystem of third parties can develop complementary products and services to resell to consumers and other businesses. Examples of platform companies include Microsoft and Intel. Innovation platforms often stimulate ecosystem innovation.
Integrated platforms.
Integrated platforms combine features of both transaction and innovation platforms. Apple, Google, and Alibaba have been classified as integrated platforms. Several integrated platform companies operating multiple discreet platforms and could also be described as "platform conglomerates", while some others are more integrated and derive synergies from combining innovation and transaction platforms.
Investment platforms.
Investment platforms are companies that might not themselves operate a major platform, but which act as holding vehicles for other platform companies, or which invest in multiple platform businesses. 
Global distribution, international development, and geostrategy.
Platforms are sometimes studied through the lens of their differing distributions and impact across the world's geographic regions. Some early work speculated that the rise of the "platform economy" could be a new means by which the United States could maintain its hegemony. While the largest platform companies by market capitalisation remain US-based, platforms based in India and Asia are fast catching up, and several authors writing in 2016 and later took the opposite view, speculating that the platform economy will help accelerate a shift of economic power towards Asia. 
Africa.
Numerous successful platforms have been launched in Africa, several of which have been home grown. In the early 2010s, there were reports by journalists, academics and development workers that Africa has been leading the world in some platform related technologies, such as by "leapfrogging" traditional fixed line internet applications and going straight to developing mobile apps. In the field of mobile money for example, it was the success of Kenya's M-Pesa that brought the technology to global attention. 
Similar systems have been introduced elsewhere in Africa, for example, m-Sente in Uganda. M-Pesa itself has expanded out of Africa to both Asia and Eastern Europe. The system allows people who only have cheap SMS capable mobile phones to send and receive money. This and similar platform services have been enthusiastically welcomed both by the end-users, and by development workers who have noted their life-enhancing effects. Ushahidi is another set of technologies developed in Africa and widely used on platforms to deliver various social benefits. While many platforms in Africa are accessible just by SMS, uptake of smartphones is also high, with the FT reporting in 2015 that mobile internet adoption is happening at double the global rate. Compared to other regions, there may have been less negative effects caused by platforms in Africa, as there has been less legacy economic infrastructure to disrupt, which also has provided an opportunity to build new systems from "ground zero". Though some legacy businesses have still been disrupted by the rise of platforms in Africa, with sometimes only the more productive firms being able to overcome barriers to adopting digital technologies.
By 2017, some of the excitement concerning home grown platform technology and the wider Africa Rising narrative has cooled, in line with recent falls in commodity prices reducing the short-term economic prospects for much of the continent. Yet optimism remains that the continent is heading in the right direction. A global survey identified 176 platform companies with a valuation over one billion dollars, yet only one was based in Africa. This was Naspers, which is headquartered in Cape Town, a city that also hosts many other smaller platform companies. A survey focused on smaller platforms based in Africa found few are either wholly foreign or indigenously owned, with most being a mixture. 
In 2019, Africa's digital platforms recorded a robust growth in form of 365 unique platforms, making up a 37% increase year on year. These represent freelance, shopping and e-hailing platforms. However, as the platform economy in the continent continue to grow, and new platforms enter the market, there is a high level of churn (high numbers of such platforms entering the market, and incumbent ones exiting). Hence, there is the existence of extreme competition for the incumbent platforms. About 64% of the overall platforms mediate activities that are place-based, thereby directly contributing to absorbing the capacity of local labor capacity. These place-based platforms are said to have been useful in the delivery of essential goods to consumers in the light of COVID-19 lockdown measures in key African geographies (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia).
Asia.
The 2016 global survey found that Asia was home to the largest number of platform companies having a market capitalisation over $930bn. Asia had 82 such companies, though their combined market value was only $930bn, second to North America with market capitalization of $3,000bn. Much of Asia's platform companies are concentrated in hubs located in Bangalore and Hangzhou. More specifically, according to the 2016 regional survey, China significantly accounted for 73% of market cap while Northeast Asia, India, and ASEAN had 22%, 4%, and 1% respectively. Within China, homegrown platforms tend to dominate across the whole platform economy, with most of the big American platforms being banned. eBay is allowed to trade in China, but has a relatively small market share compared to Chinese eCommerce platforms and was eventually shut down in 2006. In 2018, Tmall (Alibaba) took the majority proportion of e-commerce market share in China at 61.5%, followed by JD at 24.2%. Outside of China, Asian-based platforms have been enjoying rapid growth in areas relating to eCommerce, yet until the rise of TikTok, less so in social media and search. Facebook, for example, is the most popular social media platform even in India, a country with several large homegrown platforms, while in Myanmar, the "New York Times" described Facebook as "so dominant that to many people it is the internet itself." In 2016, Northeast Asia that consists of Japan and Korea had 17 platform companies with collective market capitalization of $244bn; the top five platform companies and their origin were Softbank (Tokyo, Japan), Yahoo Japan (Tokyo, Japan), Nintendo (Tokyo, Japan), Naver (Seongnam, South Korea), and Rakuten (Tokyo, Japan). India had less platform companies than Northeast Asia. There were 9 major platform companies with collective market capitalization of $39bn and the biggest platforms were two e-commerce companies Flipkart and Snapdeal. The smallest number of market share went to Southeast Asia that was home to three platform companies Garena (Singapore), Grab (Malaysia), and GO-JEK (Indonesia) that collectively had market capitalization of $7bn.
Europe.
Europe is home to a large number of platform companies, but most are quite small. In terms of platform companies that were valued over $1bn, Europe was found to have only 27 in the 2016 global survey. So far ahead of Africa and South America, but lagging well behind Asia and North America.
However, as of 2020 the German and French governments with backing from the European Commission are now pushing the idea of GAIA-X, an integrated super-platform that would give the EU digital autonomy from the influence of large American and Chinese platform providers, sometimes described as an "Airbus for Cloud".
North America.
North America, in particular the United States, is home to the world's top 5 global platform companies Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and IBM. A 2016 global survey of all platform companies with a market cap over $1bn, found 44 such companies headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, with those companies having a total value of $2.2 trillion 52% of the total worldwide value of such platform companies. Overall, the United States had 63 platform companies valued over $1bn, with Canada having one. While North America has less large platform companies than Asia, it is the clear leader in terms of overall market capitalisation, and in having platform companies with a global reach.
South America.
According to data from early 2016, only three home grown platform companies with a market capitalisation greater than $1bn had emerged in South America: these are MercadoLibre, Despegar.com, and B2W. 
The continent is however home to many start up companies. In Brazil, the Portuguese language gives an advantage to home grown companies, with an especially active start up scene existing in São Paolo. Argentina has been the most successful in creating platforms used outside its own borders, with the countries relatively small home market encouraging a more global outlook from its start up platform companies.
With a high proportion of workers already employed on an informal basis, the platform-based gig economy has not grown as fast in South America as elsewhere. Though from a progressive perspective, scholars such as Adam Fishwick have noted that Latin America's tradition of worker organised activism may have valuable lessons for workers elsewhere seeking ways to mitigate the sometimes adverse effects of platforms on their economic security.
Platforms by ownership.
Private sector.
Most of the widely used platforms are owned by the private sector. In the 2016 GCE survey of platform companies valued over $1 billion, a total of 107 privately owned companies were found, versus 69 public companies (public in the sense of being private sector, but publicly traded ). While more numerous, the privately owned companies tended to be smaller, having a total market value of $300 billion, compared to $3,900 billion for the publicly traded companies.
Public sector.
Some digital platforms are run by multilateral institutions, by national governments, and by local municipal bodies.
NGO.
Over 90% of NGOs maintain a presence on the large privately owned social media platforms such as Facebook, with some also operating their own platforms.
Platform cooperatism.
Platform cooperatism involves mutually owned platforms, being run "bottom up" by the people involved. Sometimes these platforms can effectively be competing for business with the privately owned platforms. In other cases, platform cooperatism seeks to help ordinary people have their say about political questions of the day, possibly supporting interaction with local government.
Assessment.
With the increasing centrality of digital platforms to the global economy following the 2008 financial crisis, there was an intensification of interest in assessing their impact on society and the wider economy. Many hundreds of reviews have been carried out: some by individual scholars, others by groups of academics, some by think tanks bringing together folk from a range of backgrounds, and yet others overseen by governments and transnational organisations such as the EU. Many of these reviews focussed on the overall platform economy, others on narrower areas such as the gig economy or the psychological impact of social media platforms on individuals and communities.
Much early assessment was highly positive, sometimes even taking a "utopian" view on the benefits of platforms. It's been argued and to some extent demonstrated that platforms can enhance the supply of services, improve productivity, reduce costs (e.g. by disintermediation), reduce inefficiencies in existing markets, help create entirely new markets, increase flexibility, and labour market accessibility for workers, and be especially helpful for less developed countries. Both the IMF and World Bank for example have suggested that it's the countries and industries that are quickest to adopt new platform technologies that achieve the fastest and most sustainable growth.
Various arguments have been made against platforms. They include that platforms may contribute to technological unemployment. That they accelerate the replacement of traditional jobs with precarious forms of employment that have much less labour protection. That they may contribute to declining tax revenues. That excessive use of platforms can be psychologically damaging and corrosive to communities. That they can increase inequality. That they can reproduce patterns of racism. That platforms have a net negative impact on the environment.
Post 2017 backlash.
Until 2017, most mainstream assessments of the platform economy were largely positive about its benefits to wider society. There were some exceptions; a forthcoming "techlash" had been predicted by Adrian Wooldridge as far back as 2013. Further hardening of attitudes towards platforms from some commentators and regulators had been detectable from at least early 2015. There had been a few highly critical views, e.g. from Evgeny Morozov, who in 2015 described most platforms as "parasitic: feeding off existing social and economic relations". Yet such negative assessments were rare, especially from prominent commentators who had the attention of policy makers. This began to change in 2017. Across the world, the larger privately owned platforms were subject to increasing questioning about their expanding role and responsibilities.
In the US, the "Financial Times" reported a marked change of attitudes towards online platforms across the American political spectrum, triggered by their "sheer size and power". Among U.S. Democrats, leaders of the large platform companies reportedly went from "heroes to pariahs" in just a few months.
There has also been growing hostility towards the large platform companies from some members of the American right. High-profile figures such as Steve Bannon and Richard Spencer have argued for the break up of the large tech companies, and more mainstream Republicans were reported to be running for the 2018 congressional elections on anti big-tech tickets. 
2017 also saw increased critical attention towards the larger platforms from both European and Chinese regulators. In the case of China where several of the larger US owned platforms were already banned, the focus was on their biggest home grown platforms, with commentators expressing concerns that they have become too powerful.
Much recent criticism focusses on major platforms being too big; too powerful; anti competitive; damaging to democracy, such as with the Russian meddling in the 2016 election; and bad for users mental health. In December 2017 Facebook itself admitted passive consumption of social media could be harmful to mental health, though said active engagement can be helpful. In February 2018, Unilever, one of the world's leading spenders on advertising, threatened to pull adverts from digital platforms if they "create division, foster hate or fail to protect children."
Additional concerns have been raised due to the increasing role of AI. Some scientists argue that AI is a black-box and often lacks explainability. AI can operate as a black-box in which principles of conduct and end decisions may not have been predicted or perceived by the AI's creators, let alone users. Therefore, core operations carried out by AI in platforms can be criticized as biased and exploitative. The following threads of platform exploitation can be discerned: exploitation arising from relationship between algorithms and platform workers, from behavioural psychology tactics adapted to algorithmic management, and from information asymmetries enabling “soft” control.
Despite criticism from media figures and politicians, as of early 2018 the large privately owned platforms tended to remain "wildly popular" among ordinary consumers. After leading US platform companies revealed high Q1 revenue growth in late April 2018, the "Financial Times" reported they are untouched by the backlash, in a "stunning demonstration of their platform power". The techlash continued to gather momentum however.
In January 2019 "techlash" was chosen as the digital word of the year by the American Dialect Society. Yet despite ongoing high-profile criticism and legal actions, including CEOs of platform giants being grilled by legislatures on both sides of the Atlantic, the "Daily Telegraph" suggested in December 2019 that the techlash had largely failed to halt the growing power of platforms. 
Further criticism of the big platform companies continued into 2020. In February Mark Zuckerberg himself repeated his view that the big platform companies need further regulation from the state.
By May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the techlash was reported to have been put on hold. In the early stages of the pandemic, several major platforms had made small, but useful and popular contributions to help society respond to the virus, such as Apple and Google forming a partnership to assist with contact tracing. Following the widespread introduction of lockdowns across the world, platforms were credited for helping to keep economies running and society connected, with polls showing the popularity of platform companies among the public had increased. Yet some commentators, for example Naomi Klein, remained concerned about the still growing power of platforms.
In October 2020, antitrust charges were filed against Google in the U.S, starting legal proceedings that may take years to play out, but which have been described as the most significant challenge yet for big tech. Shortly after, the Federal Trade Commission began suing Facebook. Late 2020 saw Russia pass a law that would allow large fines to be levied against platform companies for various reasons, including if they censured Russian citizens. Also in late 2020, the Chinese government announced an antitrust probe of Alibaba, with officials noting the importance of the platform economy to China's development, but also expressing concerns about the risk for excessive market concentration. 
In February 2021, the "Financial Times" wrote that it was once again "business as usual" for the Techlash.
Regulation.
During their early years, digital platforms tended to enjoy light regulation, sometimes benefiting from measures intended to help fledgling internet companies. The "inherently border-crossing" nature of platforms has made it challenging to regulate them, even when a desire has been there. Yet another difficulty has been lack of consensus about what exactly constitutes the platform economy.
Critics have argued existing law was not designed to deal with platform based companies. They expressed concern about elements such as safety and hygiene standards, taxes, compliance, crime, protection of rights and interests, and fair competition.
With many large platforms concentrated in China or the U.S., two contrasting approaches to regulation emerged. In the U.S., platforms have largely been left to develop free of state regulation. In China, while large platform companies like Tencent or Baidu are privately owned and in theory have much more freedom than SOEs, they are still tightly controlled, and also protected by the state against foreign competition, at least in their home market.
As of 2017, there had been talk of a "third way" being developed in Europe, less Laissez-faire than the approach in the U.S., but less restrictive than the approach in China. Possibilities for Co-regulation, where public regulators and the platform companies themselves cooperative to design and enforce regulation, are also being explored.
In March 2018, the EU published guidelines concerning the removal of illegal media from social media platforms, suggesting that if platform companies do not improve their self-regulation, new rules will come into effect at EU level before the end of the year.
The OECD is looking at regulating platform work, while the European Commission has stated that with new forms of work must come modern and improved forms of protection, including for those working via online platforms. With this in mind, the European Commission is planning to launch a new initiative on improving the working conditions for platform workers. In parallel with this, the European Commission has proposed a reform initiative for an EU minimum wage. New and existing labour unions have begun to become increasingly involved in representing workers engaged in the labour market section of the platform economy. With remote platform work having created what is in effect a planetary labour market, an attempt to encourage suitable working conditions on a global scale is being undertaken by the "Fairwork foundation". Fairwork are seeking to move towards mutually agreeable conditions with the co-operation of platform owners, workers, unions, and governments.
On 15 December 2020 European Commission published proposals for two regulations to regulate the platform economy: the digital services act (DSA) and the digital markets act (DMA). The aim of the digital services act is to rebalance responsibilities of users, platforms, and public authorities to European values and to foster innovation, growth and competitiveness, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, SMEs and start-ups. The digital markets act establishes a set of narrowly defined objective criteria for qualifying a large online platform as a so-called “gatekeeper”. Pursuant to the DMA proposal, gatekeeper is a company which:

After the Fall (Keith Jarrett album)

After the Fall is a two-disc live album by American jazz pianist Keith Jarrett recorded with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack DeJohnette. The album was recorded on November 14, 1998 in New Jersey Performing Arts Center but released only in 2018.
Chris Pearson of "The Times" stated "The title refers to Keith Jarrett’s 'fall' into a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome in autumn (or fall) 1996. As the American pianist explains in his sleeve notes, the illness kept him from playing publicly for two years. This concert, recorded near his home in New Jersey, was his first post-recovery attempt to play before an audience. It’s a caveat of sorts, as is its casual capture through the venue’s mixing console. Yet the tape and the trio sound fine."
Reception.
Thom Jurek of Allmusic wrote "This double disc isn't merely a compelling historical document, it is an exemplary concert full of inspired readings of classic jazz tunes ranging from the Great American Songbook through bebop and John Coltrane."

Cámbiame

Cámbiame was a Spanish reality television show focused on makeovers. The style, which was presented by Marta Torné and later by , was developed by and it was broadcast on Telecinco from Monday to Friday from 1:50 p.m. to 3:00 pm, between 15 June 2015 and 13 April 2018.
History.
At the beginning of 2015, due to the success of US makeover TV shows broadcast on Divinity, Mediaset España considered copying this style, going back to old styles of shows such as "Cambio radical" or "El patito feo" (Antena 3). So, in February, the Spanish group approved a pilot episode to the production company .
After some months without relevant news, and despite having a lot of promotion and information for selecting participants through "", in April it was selected in the 2015 edition of the Cannes MIP TV as one of the best non-fiction and entertainment TV shows. Later on, in May, it was announced that Marta Torné would be the host and that Cristina Rodriguez and would be two of the three stylists. Shortly thereafter, was confirmed as the last member of the stylist team, instead of the designer and stylist Gala González, who appeared in the pilot with Cristina and Pelayo, but couldn't participate in the show due to a scheduling conflict.
Finally, once the preparations were completed, Telecinco and Divinity piloted "Cámbiame" simultaneously on Monday 15 June 2015 at 2:20 pm, keeping it on daily broadcast on Telecinco.
After three weeks of broadcasting, Telecinco confirmed that this show would be broadcast at prime time on the main channel under the name "Cámbiame Premium", featuring Jorge Javier Vázquez with the collaboration of the stylists in the daily version. Moreover, it was broadcast live and involved physical changes and also changes in the environment of the participants. After its cancellation, the makeovers were still broadcast in a pre-prime time show called "Cámbiame de noche", presented by Marta Torné.
Furthermore, on 9 December 2016 it was confirmed that Marta Torné would leave the show to retake her career as an actress. After her departure, Telecinco entrusted Carlota Corredera with the hosting of the format. She would join the show in January 2017.
A year later, on 29 January 2018, despite its slight loss of viewership, Telecinco wanted to renew the show by adding new teams of stylists, and replacing the sets where the change was carried out. It also included some changes to the participant's home, with personal advice on shopping and the incorporation of a new jury. Besides, it was live broadcast and it extended its duration. However, the viewership didn't increase with those changes, so Telecinco finally decided to cancel the show. The last episode was broadcast on 13 April 2018 and the show was replaced by the game show "Pasapalabra en familia".
Format.
First round.
The space has a ten-metre mechanical catwalk, which connects the entrance door to the coaches area entrance. For 60 seconds, while the participants arrive at the three stylists to the conveyor belt, they should be convinced by their stories to manage to get a change. If one of the juries pushes the button, the catwalk, which has two green lights of its sides, will turn yellow; and if two push it, the light will turn orange, and if all they push it, it will turn red and it will stop because the jury don't want to change that participant, leaving them out of the programme automatically, unless one of the members of the jury decide to change their hair or make-up or in order to look like a celebrity, a process known as “Cámbiame Clon”. By contrast, if they don't push the button, the participant will have to choose a member of the jury to change his/her style, unless just one push the button it will start the transformation process.
After, the makeover arrived where the transformation process can be seen (clothes, shoes, accessories, hairstyle, makeup, manicure, pedicure, cosmetic dentistry, infiltration and even tattoos), though the result won't be shown until the end. Furthermore, the participants' history is known through family and friends’ testimony. In the end, the catwalk starts to work again to welcome the participant waited by their family and so that he/she can check its change in the mirror.
Second round.
After the programme's change of scenery, they stop the casting, more than one person can participate on each episode and the change starts three hours before "Cámbiame" is broadcast, which you can see live on "Mitele.es." Moreover, at the beginning or during the episode "Cámbiame Cam" may work and it will choose someone from the viewership who wants to change their image. Those processes are carried out by coaches, who are helped by hairdressers and makeup artists when doing the change. Two stylists' team can make two different proposals for one participant. Likewise, sometimes they only make hairstyle and makeup changes.
On the other hand, the show has a studio divided into four areas of work: wardrobe area, hairdressing and makeup area, aesthetic area and hair washing area. There is also a waiting room where final touches are made. Then, after going through all those areas, the contestants go to the set in order to model on the catwalk with his/her new look.
At the end, the stylists explain their work, the price of each garment appears on the look and the jury is responsible for evaluating and sometimes they also grade the changes made by their workmates. But after 24 episodes the jury vanishes and the coaches are the ones who judge.
There is also the possibility to change a person in his/her house. This section is known as ""Cámbiame a domicilio", in which the stylists go around Spain to make a change of image in the participant's house. In the same way, the section "Cámbiame Shopping" will help those people who don't find their clothing style by going shopping with one of the stylists, who will advise them at any time.
In "Cámbiame Collection", the programme also includes aspects about the appearance of some famous people. When they attend events like fashion shows or award ceremonies in "Cámbiame News". "Cámbiame Zoom" carries out an in-depth analysis of some of their styles. "Cámbiame Flashback" focuses on the changes that some celebrities had gone through over the years. In "Cámbiame Remember" we may see how some people that had already changed now maintain their image or in "Cámbiame Copy" they may give us tricks to copy the style of some celebrities. Moreover, through "Cambiamepedia"", the stylists explain the meaning of some concepts related to the fashion world.
Team.
Programmes' viewership.
In its first two years of broadcasting, Cámbiame had an average of 12.7% share and 1.364.000 viewers, making it the preferred choice among commercial television channels. It increased its national average up to 14.3% of Television Rating Point. On 16 March 2016 its viewership record reached a 15.2% record (1,645,000 viewers). Nevertheless, as the programme format changed, the viewership began to decline in its fourth season, with around a million viewers or even less which led to its withdrawal from Telecinco's programming in 2018.

Rug plot

A rug plot is a plot of data for a single quantitative variable, displayed as marks along an axis. It is used to visualise the distribution of the data. As such it is analogous to a histogram with zero-width bins, or a one-dimensional scatter plot.
Rug plots are often used in combination with two-dimensional scatter plots by placing a rug plot of the x values of the data along the x-axis, and similarly for the y values. This is the origin of the term "rug plot", as these rug plots with perpendicular markers look like tassels along the edges of the rectangular "rug" of the scatter plot.

Quadrangular Tower (), or Keeper of the Fortress of Baku (), is a stone keep built in the 14th century. It is part of the Old City in Baku, Azerbaijan. On August 2, 2001, the building was declared a "national architectural monument" by the Cabinet of Azerbaijan.
History.
The tower was built in the 14th century and was an integral part of the fortress wall and the defensive fortifications in Baku. Construction was done to maintain the architecture and integrity of the fortress walls. The towers were built to make the defense system easier. According to medieval authors, within 70 semicircular and northern walls of the Baku Fortress Wall was a quadrangular fortress-type tower. In the Middle Ages it was used as an . The tower was built to store weapons and to further strengthen the northern part of Baku.
In 2014, substantial repair and restoration works were held on the tower by the Old City State Historical-Architectural Reserve Department. After that, it started to operate as the Old City Traditional Art Center under the name "The Tower of Arts."
Architectural features.
The height of the tower is 16 meters, the thickness of the walls is 2 meters. For rapid movement of soldiers, a tunnel continued along the bottom of the wall towards the tower gate. This tunnel surrounded the city on the northern side.

Pete James

Peter James FRPS (1958–2018) was a British archivist and curator of photography, at Birmingham Central Library. He curated photographic exhibitions internationally and served as chair of the Committee of National Photography Collections, as well as receiving the Royal Photographic Society's Colin Ford Award.
Life and work.
James' interest in photography was kindled when he worked for Kodak in Harrow in the 1970s, and visited their Kodak Museum during his lunch breaks.
After obtaining a BA in Humanities, Ceramics and Art History from the Polytechnic of Wales in 1987, James arrived in Birmingham in 1986 to study the History of Photography, and Art &amp; Design at Birmingham Polytechnic for his MA, which he received in 1989. 
He was Curator of Photography Collections – a post created for him – at Birmingham Central Library (latterly the Library of Birmingham) from January 1989 to October 2015. His work there resulted in the library's photography collection becoming one of the United Kingdom's National Collections of Photography.
In 2015, Birmingham City Council made drastic cuts to the Library of Birmingham's funding, and in October that year, James and the entire photography department team were made redundant.
James curated photographic exhibitions in Birmingham, at the Libraries where he worked, at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and at Ikon Gallery; in London, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and at Somerset House; and overseas, at the Royal Palace of Milan and Museum Africa, Johannesburg. He also served as chair of the Committee of National Photography Collections.
He was an Accredited Senior in Imaging in the Creative Industries (ASICI) and a double Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society (FRPS), and received the Royal Photographic Society's Colin Ford Award, given in recognition of a major contribution to photographic history, in 2009.
He was a co-founder of the independent arts organisation GRAIN, which aims to support and develop artists working in photography.
James died on 11 March 2018, aged 60, after suffering from a liver condition. He was survived by his wife and two children.
For some years, he had been researching George Shaw, the first photographer to operate in Birmingham. His paper on Shaw was published posthumously, in the Royal Photographic Society journal "Photo-Historian".

William Niering

William Albert Niering (1924 – August 30, 1999) was an American botanist and internationally recognized wetlands expert, who was Lucretia L. Allyn Professor of Botany at Connecticut College and director of the Connecticut College Arboretum.
Early life and education.
Niering was born in Scotrun, Pennsylvania to George and Emma Everitt Niering. He attended Pennsylvania State University in 1942. His education was interrupted by World War II, when he served in the army from 1942 to 1945; his active service took place in the South Pacific and he attained the rank of staff sergeant. After the war, he returned to Penn State. There, he received his undergraduate degree in Biology in 1948 and his master's degree in Botany in 1950. He received his PhD in plant ecology from Rutgers University in 1952.
Career.
Niering joined the Connecticut College Botany Department in the fall of 1952.
At Connecticut College, Niering served as the director of the Connecticut College Arboretum from 1965 to 1968, and then from 1969 to 1988. In 1988, he became the Research Director for the Arboretum which he served for eleven years. He was acting President of Connecticut College from August 15 to December 15, 1992. He was a popular teacher and he established long-term vegetation research projects, providing opportunities for students to conduct field work and analyze change in the natural landscape over time. He helped found the Environmental Model Committee in the 1970s, a group of staff, students and faculty that help organize and encourage sustainability efforts at Connecticut College. He was an early proponent of sustainability on campus, helping to institute the first campus-wide recycling program.
His research spanned a variety of ecosystems, from Connecticut's shores and inlands to the islands of the South Pacific to the flora of the Southwest. He was an internationally recognized expert on the ecology of wetlands and tidal marshes. His work contributed to the scientific communities knowledge of the importance that wetlands serve in the environment. His work was instrumental in helping to pass the Connecticut Tidal Wetlands Act (1969) which prevented the loss of wetlands to dredge and filling activities. He also worked on ecological restoration efforts on wetlands in Connecticut and Long Island. He was an authority on vegetation management through controlled burns and herbicide application, which he researched and practiced at the Arboretum. From 1974 to 1977, Niering was a member of the advisory group, North Atlantic Regional Advisory Committee. He contributed to policy statements on urban parks as well as contributed to the planning process of the National Park Service. His scientific contributions spanned over many projects throughout his duration on the Regional Advisory Committee. One study in particular focused on the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. In 1978 Congress designated the Pine Barrens as the Pinelands National Preserve; this would not have been possible without the scientific knowledge of William Niering. In February 1980, the United States Department of the Interior awarded Dr. Niering the title of Honorary Park Ranger. This title came equipped with all the privileges and benefits of being a Park Ranger.
Niering was the editor of the scientific journal "Restoration Ecology" from its beginning in 1993 until his death.
Death.
William Niering died suddenly on August 30, 1999 at the age of 75. He had just addressed the incoming class of students at Connecticut College when he collapsed. On December 4, 2000, the Goshen Cove Natural Area Preserve in Waterford was renamed the William A. Niering Nature Preserve to honor his life and work.

TKO (The Knock Out)

T.K.O. (The Knock Out) is the eighth studio album by American singer Mýa. It is the follow–up to her Grammy nominated album "Smoove Jones" (2016) and was released April 20, 2018, on her label Planet 9 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut album "Mýa" (1998). Recorded between 2015–2016, "T.K.O." is solely produced in its entirely by musician and producer Lamar "MyGuyMars" Edwards with additional production from Los Da Mystro, Lyle LeDuff, Hardwerk and Khirye Tyler.
Sonically, "T.K.O." is a contemporary R&amp;B album fusing elements of 1970s and 1990s R&amp;B with a more modern, contemporary sound and serves as departure from her previous studio effort "Smoove Jones", which paid homage to traditional R&amp;B from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. "T.K.O." has spawned eight singles – "Ready for Whatever", "Ready, Part II", "You Got Me", "Damage", "Knock You Out", "With You", "Down" and "Open".
Background.
As tradition, on February 14, 2016, Mýa released her seventh studio album "Smoove Jones" (2016) to commemorate the release of her debut single "It's All About Me" and eighteenth anniversary in the entertainment industry. The release paid homage to R&amp;B/soul/hip-hop with old school elements from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was released exclusively through Apple Music. Critically, "Smoove Jones" received "generally favourable" reviews from music critics. In 2017, "Smoove Jones" received a nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held on February 12, 2017. Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, Mýa released a music video for the fan favorite "Coolin'". Filmed in Sydney, Australia, director Matt Sharp captures the singer's unmistakable beauty while she lets her vocals do the rest on a sandy beach. Later in 2017, Mýa made a guest appearance on GoldLink's album "At What Cost" on the track "Roll Call".
Artwork.
For the album's packaging, Mýa traveled to Nassau, Bahamas and completed a photoshoot for her single and album covers. On the album cover, Mýa is dressed in black lingerie with a black robe draping her body, while directing a smoldering stare into the camera.
Development.
"T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" was recorded between 2015–2016 after the release of "Smoove Jones" (2016) which received a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Album. Like with all her independent projects, Harrison served as executive producer for "T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" as well which entailed her scouting for producers, songwriters, arranging the album's track listing, and keeping track of the accounting. With "T.K.O." though, Harrison decided to form a partnership with musician and producer Lamar "MyGuyMars" Edwards. Edwards had contributed production on her last studio effort, "Smoove Jones", which catered more towards traditional R&amp;B. The creation process for "T.K.O." started when Harrison continued to work with Edwards and formed a musical partnership. Speaking with "Billboard", Harrison acknowledged the process to the project was "easy." However, before dabbling into the contemporary R&amp;B space for her next independent project, Harrison made the conscious decision to release "Smoove Jones" first to satisfy longtime fans that connected with that particular sound, which is more eclectic, classic and old school. Musically with "T.K.O.", since contemporary R&amp;B is more current sonically, Harrison and Edwards just essentially incorporated and fused it with 90's R&amp;B, SWV, Aaliyah, R.Kelly, Mint Condition along with Prince, Teddy Pendergrass and The Isley Brothers influences from the 70s. Using material she recorded back in 2011, 2015, and 2016 from her archive, Harrison commented it was all about "building" and "tweaking" songs. Commenting on the results, Harrison said, "It was all about creating a nice experience for R&amp;B fans, R&amp;B lovers, and have it apply to today’s sound of music, sonically, and that’s what we did." As executive producer, Harrison was held responsible for drafting all of her contracts, handling publishing split sheets, and generating her own revenue for/funding each component of a project and to avoid early leakage of the project or any of her music, Harrison drafts and services a pre- and post-recording agreement to hold the producers, writers, artists, and engineers liable for leakage, sharing, placement, and playing of her music.
Composition.
Music and songs.
Described as "Smoove Jones" part two, "T.K.O." serves as continuation on Harrison's last studio effort except with "Smoove Jones", she blended R&amp;B/soul/hip-hop genre with elements of 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and geared towards traditional R&amp;B, while "T.K.O." is current contemporary R&amp;B with a hint of 90's R&amp;B and influences from the 70s. In terms of sounds, Mýa revealed early on that the album is very heavily leaning on R&amp;B slow jams. "T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" starts with "Open" featuring DMV rapper GoldLink and is describe as a slice of atmospheric trap-flavored R&amp;B. The pulsating, "Down" serves as the album's fourth track. Track five, "Ready For Whatever 2.0" is a reimagining of the album's first single and is an homage to Aaliyah's effortless cool. Inspired by Mint Condition and Prince, "Damage" was recorded back in 2011 and serves as the album's sixth track. Track eight, "You Got Me" is a millennial slow jam that blends combination of steady drums and synths reminiscent of the 90's R&amp;B. The spacey, "Knock You Out" is an Isley Brothers-indebted bedroom jam with guitar licks and spaced-out vocal harmonies and serves as the album's tenth track. The album's final track, the 80's/90's big ballad "If Tomorrow Never Comes" was originally recorded back in 2011 and inspired by the vocal work of R&amp;B group Jodeci.
Release and promotion.
Initially, "T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" was scheduled for a Valentine Day release to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single, "It's All About Me," however the project was unable to make its deadline and pushed back. In an interview with Hot 97, Mýa confirmed "T.K.O." was scheduled for an April 20, 2018 release to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut album "Mýa" (1998). Digitally, the release was distributed through indie distribution company, The Orchard. Her first release under Sony Music company. Through her official website store, physical copies was made available for purchase exclusively in standard, autographed or personalized editions. In honor of her twentieth anniversary and to celebrate "T.K.O."s album release Mýa performed at the House of Blues in New York City on April 27, 2018. She held a private album listening session at UnplugdLA's The Study in Los Angeles, California.
Singles.
In September 2017, Mýa began releasing a series of singles in support of the album. Mýa released the first single from "T.K.O.(The Knock Out)", "Ready for Whatever" on September 22, 2017. A music video for "Ready for Whatever" was produced and directed by Mýa co-starring R&amp;B singer Kevin McCall as her love interest. Less than two months, its follow up single and sequel, "Ready, Part II" was released on November 24, 2017. The song paid homage to R. Kelly's "It Seems Like You're Ready". A third single, "You Got Me", was released on February 14, 2018, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single "It's All About Me". "Damage", the fourth single from "T.K.O." was released on March 23, 2018. Less than a month, a week before the album's release, "Knock You Out" was released as an instant grat download when fans pre-ordered "T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" alongside previous singles "You Got Me" and "Damage." In 2019, as tradition in honor her debut single, Harrison gifted her fans with a new music video to commemorate the anniversary. "With You" was released February 14, 2019. Approximately two months later, in honor of the one year anniversary of her thirteenth studio project, "TKO (The Knock Out)", Harrison gifted her fans with another new video. "Down" was released April 20, 2019.
Reception.
Critical.
"Paper" magazine gave "T.K.O." a favorable review and called it "impressive in its scope" and concluded, "throughout TKO, though Mya is a well-studied product of her influences, she is as an artist all her own, producing, writing, and owning all of it."
Commercial.
"T.K.O. (The Knock Out)" debuted at number forty-one on the Independent Albums chart.

Mabel Ping-Hua Lee

Mabel Ping-Hua Lee (; October 7, 1896 – 1966) was a Chinese-American women's rights activist and minister who campaigned for women's suffrage in the United States. Later in life, Lee became a Baptist minister, working with the First Chinese Baptist Church in Chinatown.
Born in China and raised in New York City, Lee received a bachelor's degree and master's degree from Barnard College, and later a doctorate in economics from Columbia University in 1921, becoming the first Chinese woman in the United States to earn a doctorate in economics. In the 1910s, Lee became an activist for women's suffrage, and participated in the 1912 New York City women's suffrage parade, where she rode on horseback. Following the eventual passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, Lee still was unable to vote due to her status as a Chinese immigrant per the Chinese Exclusion Act. She would not gain the right to vote until at least the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943.
Lee became a Baptist minister in 1924, after taking over her father's church following his death. She went on to run the First Chinese Baptist Church for forty years, while also becoming a leader within the American Baptist Home Mission Society. Lee additionally became a community advocate for the Chinese community in New York and residents of Chinatown, working with the Chinese Community Center. In recognition of her life and advocacy on behalf of women and Chinese immigrants in the United States, the Chinatown U.S. Post Office on Doyers Street was renamed in her honor in 2017.
Early life.
Mabel Ping-Hua Lee was born on October 7, 1896 in Guangzhou during the Qing dynasty of China. Her father was Lee To or Lee Towe, a minister who emigrated to the United States and worked in the American Baptist Home Mission Society. He first served as a missionary to the Chinese community in Washington state in 1898 and then was appointed to minister at the Morning Star Mission in New York City, where he became a leading member in New York's Chinatown. Her mother's name is recorded in US census documents alternately as Lennick or Libreck Lee.
Lee spent her early childhood in China, attending a missionary school where she learned English. She was raised by her mother and grandmother while her father was in America. It has been reported she traveled with her mother to America in the summer of 1900 when she was four years old to reunite with her father. However, most articles, including a 1912 New-York Tribune article, made mention that she settled with her family in New York by 1905. She was also an only child but the same New-York Tribune article writes of a baby sister. Her family lived in a tenement at 53 Bayard Street in Chinatown. She attended New York City's public schools, specifically Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, which was a school meant to accommodate the increase in immigrant children.
Education.
In 1913, Lee began attending Barnard College where she majored in history and philosophy. She joined the Debating Club and Chinese Students' Association. In 1916, she ran for president of this student association against Tse-ven Soong, who later became finance minister of China's national government. She wrote articles for "The Chinese Students’ Monthly", in which she championed for woman's suffrage and argued for equality as necessary in a democracy. While at Barnard College, she also received a master's degree in educational administration.
In 1917, Lee was admitted to Columbia University for a doctorate in economics. The Chinese government was impressed with her research in the agricultural economy and granted her a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship which allowed her to continue her studies. She became the first woman to win this scholarship. She was the vice president of the Columbia Chinese Club and became associate editor of "The Chinese Students’ Monthly". Lee graduated in 1921 or 1922 and earned a PhD in Economics from Columbia University in 1921. She was selected by the Board of Council of Columbia University as the University Scholar in Economics for her research work in agricultural economics. This was the first time a Chinese student was given this award. Her final dissertation was titled "The Economic History of China: With Special Reference to Agriculture" and was later published. Her thesis was the first agricultural economics text written by a foreign Chinese student and maintained a balanced view of western economic ideology and Chinese traditional economic thought within the context of modern agricultural reform.
Post-education.
After her studies, Lee traveled to Europe in 1923 to study postwar economics. A local Baptist newspaper reported, "On March 28, 1923, Miss Lee sailed for France where she is now engaged in the study of European Economics, in fuller preparation for her life work, in her native land, China. A position of great trust and signal honor awaits her arrival in China." Lee had numerous job opportunities including an offer from a Chinese firm interested in trade from the United States to China. She was also recruited for the Dean of Women students at the University of Amoy, now Xiamen University. However, after the sudden death of her father, she went back to New York City in 1924 to care for her mother. She was appointed by the American Baptist Home Mission Society to take on her father's duties and became chairman of the Morning Star Mission. Lee continued to travel to her homeland, eager to join the new generation of workers and help the people of China, but on her third trip to China in 1937, she decided otherwise. Racial and sexist discrimination were likely to reduce her chances of attaining her goals and it became unsafe to live in China with the Japanese invasion and the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. These factors coupled with her familial and religious duties ultimately helped her decide to stay in New York.
Women's suffrage.
Mabel Lee's early suffragist and nationalist consciousness was influenced by her father's religious and nationalistic views for China and by New York's liberal environment. Before she was writing essays advocating equality in "The Chinese Students’ Monthly," she was riding horseback as a teenager in the campaign for women's suffrage in New York state. On May 4, 1912, a fifteen year old Lee led a parade in support of women's voting rights with the likes of Annie Rensselaer Tinker, the Women's Political Union, and Anna Howard Shaw in New York. The parade grew a large crowd, up to ten thousand people were in attendance. Shaw carried a National American Woman Suffrage Association banner that stated: "N.A.W.S.A Catching Up with China" while Lee rode on horseback. She also led Chinese and Chinese-American women in a parade down Fifth Avenue in 1917 as a member of the Women's Political Equality League.
In a 1914 issue of "The Chinese Students' Monthly," Lee wrote that feminism is “the extension of democracy or social justice and equality of opportunities to women”. She continued to write articles throughout college, calling for gender equality but also began giving speeches. At the Suffrage Workshop in 1915, Lee gave a speech that was covered in the New York Times. The speech was titled "China's Submerged Half" and stated:
In 1917, women won the right to vote in the state of New York, amending the state's constitution. However, Lee herself was unable to exercise that constitutional right because of the discriminatory federal naturalization laws of the time. The Chinese Exclusion Act, which was not repealed until 1943, barred Chinese immigrants from the process of naturalization. While Lee fought for equality and the right to vote, she and other immigrant women, were unable to reap the benefits until years later. Her mother supported the suffrage movement but also could not vote. It is unclear if Lee ever voted or if she became a US citizen.
According to the only directly-attributed quote from Lee in a 1912 New-York Tribune article about her, entitled "Chinese Girl Wants Vote", Lee's definition of suffrage was framed in the context of its benefit to the family, specifically a husband.
In a later essay, "The Meaning of Woman Suffrage" Lee authored and published in "The Chinese students' monthly", while providing arguments in favor of suffrage for the "interest" of the race, community, woman herself, husband, and child, she articulated her definition of the feminist movement as follows.
Ministry.
When Mabel Lee's father died from a heart attack in 1924, she took over his role as head of the Baptist mission in Chinatown at the age of 28. Although this was meant to be a temporary position, it would become her life's work. Lee traveled three times to China during the 1920s and 1930s, and even had job offers awaiting her there, but she eventually chose to settle permanently in New York and focus on her father's church.
Lee began raising funds from the American Baptist Home Mission Society and local Chinese American organizations to help fund a Chinese Christian Center in memory of her father. In 1926, she purchased a building for this community center at 21 Pell Street in Chinatown. The center offered English classes, a medical clinic, and a kindergarten. Lee believed that an independent Chinese church was crucial for providing support and a feeling of freedom to its community members, who were otherwise marginalized and oppressed in American society. 
Lee's view that there needed to be a Chinese Christianity and not a European American Protestantism sometimes brought her into conflict with the larger white-led Baptist mission in New York City. In 1954, Lee was able to secure the title of the 21 Pell Street property solely under First Chinese Baptist Church which from then on became fully independent. Paradoxically, this independence coincided with the increasing secularization of younger generations of Chinese Americans, and led to dwindling membership at the church. However, under her leadership the church became the first "self-supporting Chinese church in America." As a bilingual Chinese-American, Lee was able to provide significant assistance to the working class Chinese immigrant community by providing classes teaching the English language, typewriting, and broadcasting and carpentry among other useful skills. Lee even participated by preaching and taught kindergarten and Sunday school. In many ways the church functioned as an underground social service center for the Chinese community.
The First Chinese Baptist Church is still standing and continues to offer the social services Lee started and strives to maintain the community's civil rights she fought for.
Personal life and death.
Mabel Lee never married and managed to maintain economic independence. This was a lifestyle only women with higher education could have had during Lee's lifetime. She never went back to her academic studies, even after friend Hu Shih suggested she continue her "scholastic and intellectual interests". Lee chose to dedicate her life to Christ and the Chinatown community until her death in 1966. She was 70 years old.
Legacy.
In November 2017, a motion was introduced in Congress by Rep. Nydia Velazquez to rename the Chinatown Station U.S. Post Office at 6 Doyers Street in honor of Mabel Lee. The bill was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in March 2018. There was a dedication ceremony at the First Chinese Baptist Church at 21 Pell St. on December 3, 2018 at 11am.
In March 2018, Lee was honored as one of a featured series of women's suffrage activists displayed on LinkNYC kiosks in New York City as part of a partnership with the Museum of the City of New York.
Lee was named a National Women's History Alliance honoree in 2020.

Afro-Bolivian monarchy

The Afro-Bolivian Royal House is a ceremonial monarchy recognized as part of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which does not interfere with the system of the Presidential republic in force within the country. It is centred in Mururata, a village in the Yungas region of Bolivia. The monarchy is treated as a customary leader of the Afro-Bolivian community.
The powers of the Afro-Bolivian king are similar to those of a traditional chief, representing the Afro-Bolivian community.
History.
The components of this royal house are the descendants of an old African tribal monarchy that were brought to Bolivia as slaves. The founding monarch, Uchicho, was allegedly of Kongo and Senegalese origin, and was brought to the Hacienda of the Marquis de Pinedo, in the area of Los Yungas in what is now La Paz Department. Other slaves allegedly recognized him as a man of regal background (a prince from the ancient Kingdom of Kongo) when seeing his torso exposed with royal tribal marks only held by royalty. He was crowned in 1823, and was succeeded by Bonifaz, who adopted the surname of Pinedo, the plantation owner. Bonifaz was succeeded by Don José and Don Bonifacio, the latter of whom was born in 1880 crowned in 1932. When Bonifacio died in 1954, the house was led by his oldest daughter Doña Aurora. Because of the lack of a male heir, the kingdom was left without a king for 38 years. Aurora's oldest son, Julio Pinedo, was given the title of king in 1992. 
The Royal House was officially recognized by the Bolivian state in 2007 with the public coronation of Julio, the current King of the Afro-Bolivian community, which was done by the authorities of the La Paz Department.
King Julio has a son, Prince Rolando, who was born in 1995. By 2021 he was studying law at the Universidad de Los Andes in La Paz and preparing for his prospective role as king, stating that his ambitions were to “keep pushing forward to make the Afro-Bolivian community more recognised and visible, the way my father has done until now”.

The very first Italian registration plates, from 1913 to the end of the 1920s, were rectangular, with a white background and with the name or initials of the colony in red followed by the registration number, on a single line, but the documentation on this is fragmentary. For the Italian colonial troops, however, special military service plates were used with the initials SOM (Somalia) or T (Tripolitania) in front.
Subsequently, until 1935, the Italian colonies used white plates on black with a colonial code on the first line, and up to 5 numbers on the second line. The numbers, in relief, were assigned serially and the plates were made of metal, with the fasces as a seal. The colonial codes were:
Between 1937 and 1941 there was an Italian governorate in Ethiopia and in those years a new type of Italian license plate was issued. They were exactly the same as the previous ones, but they had three squares on the left, colored top to bottom green, white and red, like the Italian flag, with the letters AOI ("Africa Orientale Italiana") for Italian East Africa inside. The front plates resembled standard Italian front license plates, as these were smaller, and only sometimes had the colored squares like the rear license plates.

Metabolic gene cluster

Metabolic gene clusters or biosynthetic gene clusters are tightly linked sets of mostly non-homologous genes participating in a common, discrete metabolic pathway. The genes are in physical vicinity to each other on the genome, and their expression is often coregulated. Metabolic gene clusters are common features of bacterial and most fungal genomes, and are less often found in other organisms. They are most widely known for producing secondary metabolites, which are the source or basis of most pharmaceutical compounds, natural toxins, and chemical communication and chemical warfare between organisms. Metabolic gene clusters are also involved in nutrient acquisition, toxin degradation, antimicrobial resistance, and vitamin biosynthesis. Given all these properties of metabolic gene clusters, they play a key role in shaping microbial ecosystems, including microbiome-host interactions. Thus several computational genomics tools have been developed to predict metabolic gene clusters.
Databases.
MIBiG, BiG-FAM
Bioinformatic tools.
Tools based on rules.
Bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict, and determine the abundance and expression of, this kind of gene cluster in microbiome samples, from metagenomic data. Since the size of metagenomic data is considerable, filtering and clusterization thereof are important parts of these tools. These processes can consist of dimensionality -reduction techniques, such as Minhash, and clusterization algorithms such as k-medoids and affinity propagation. Also several metrics and similarities have been developed to compare them.
Genome mining for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) has become an integral part of natural product discovery. The &gt;200,000 microbial genomes now publicly available hold information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of homologous BGCs, which allows identification of cross-species patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or biological activities. However, current tools are hindered by a bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used to group these BGCs into gene cluster families (GCFs).
BiG-SLiCE (Biosynthetic Genes Super-Linear Clustering Engine), a tool designed to cluster massive numbers of BGCs. By representing them in Euclidean space, BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion.
Satria et. al, 2021 across BiG-SLiCE demonstrate the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential, opens up new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes are sequenced from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry.
Evolution.
The origin and evolution of metabolic gene clusters have been debated since the 1990s. It has since been demonstrated that metabolic gene clusters can arise in a genome by genome rearrangement, gene duplication, or horizontal gene transfer, and some metabolic clusters have evolved convergently in multiple species. Horizontal gene cluster transfer has been linked to ecological niches in which the encoded pathways are thought to provide a benefit. It has been argued that clustering of genes for ecological functions results from reproductive trends among organisms, and goes on to contribute to accelerated adaptation by increasing refinement of complex functions in the pangenome of a population.

Joe Roberts (motorcyclist)

Joe Roberts (born June 16, 1997) is an American professional motorcycle racer. Roberts competes in the FIM Moto2 World Championship in 2021 with Italtrans Racing Team aboard a Kalex chassis bike.
Career.
Early career.
Roberts' introduction to motorcycles was at a young age. He first rode a 50 cc motorcycle just shy of his 4th birthday. Roberts's earliest competition was in youth flat track and Supermoto. From there he transitioned to mini-road racing on kart tracks and then to full sized tracks on a Honda RS125. He competed successfully for two seasons in the USGPRU (United States Grand Prix Racer's Union) finishing 3rd in points in 125GP in 2010. At the end of 2010 he was invited to the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup try-outs for the 2011 season and was one of 12 selected from 100 applicants.
Roberts spent 3 seasons (2011–2013) with the Red Bull Rookies. In his first season he recorded a win and a track record at Brno, a track he had never seen before. He improved his results in 2012 with best finishes of 2nd, 4th, 5th and was one of very few riders to be invited back for a 3rd year in 2013 to ride the new KTM Moto3 bike. Roberts showed good promise on the 4 stroke machine leading races in Jerez, Brno and Silverstone but some bad luck saw him fail to finish a number of races which lowered his final standing. That same year, just 6 days after his 16th birthday, he competed back in the US in the AMA aboard a Honda CBR600RR, recording a sensational double win at Barber Motorsports, setting a record for the youngest win in AMA Pro Road racing. He won again at Laguna Seca and scored another double win at Miller Motorsports Park, thereby scoring 5 wins from the 5 AMA races he entered.
In 2014 he returned full-time to the US to ride for Team Hammer in AMA Daytona Sportbike on a Honda CBR600RR. However, the combination of an uncompetitive package and some injuries meant he wasn't able to continue his run of success from 2013. For 2015, Roberts returned to his winning ways aboard a Yamaha R6 in the new AMA/FIM MotoAmerica Stock600 class with 9 wins and a 2nd from 11 starts, sealing the championship at Laguna Seca, before the final round of the series at New Jersey, where he moved up to the Supersport class. There, he dominated practice and qualifying, had a runaway victory in Race 1 and finished a close second in Race 2. Finishing 3rd in Superprestigio in Las Vegas at the end of the year. 2016 saw him compete in AMA/MotoAmerica Supersport on a Yamaha R6 where he climbed the podium 3 times and scored 3 pole positions. He was unfortunately forced to miss several races due to injury.
Moto2 World Championship.
AGR Team (2017).
2017.
In 2017 Roberts returned to Europe to compete in the FIM CEV Moto2 class with the AGRteam. Mid-year due to his strong performance on the Kalex machine, he was invited by AGR to join the World Championship Moto2 team and made a sensational debut in Brno coming from 29th on the grid to finish 10th in his first race at the world level. 
American Racing (2019–2020).
2020.
In Roberts qualified on pole position at the opening round of the season, becoming the first American rider to do so since Ben Spies at the 2010 Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix and the first one in Moto2 since Kenny Noyes at the 2010 French motorcycle Grand Prix. He finished the race in fourth, after never having finished better than 13th over the previous two seasons. He would qualify for pole again in the fourth round and finished the race in third, becoming the first American driver on the podium since Spies at the 2011 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix and the first in mid class since John Kocinski at the 1993 Dutch TT. A documentary was made by Dorna following Roberts and American Racing titled "Behind The Stars And Stripes".
After the 2020 season Roberts was seen as a hot commodity in the Grand Prix World Championship. Roberts was offered not only deals with multiple front running teams on the Moto2 grid but was even offered a MotoGP ride with Aprilia to partner Aleix Espargaro in 2021, a move that was endorsed not only by Roberts manager and American Racing team principal Eitan Bitbul but also his mentor John Hopkins and was even endorsed by Espargaro himself. 
Italtrans Racing Team (2021–present).
2021.
Roberts ultimately declined the offer to move up to MotoGP for Aprilia upon consulting with Ducati rider Andrea Dovizioso and instead chose to race for Italtrans Racing Team, whom Moto2 series champion Enea Bastianini raced for before moving up to MotoGP himself.

Torre di Roccabruna

The Torre di Roccabruna is a medieval tower in Siena, central Tuscany, Italy.
History.
Once, the "Bruna" or "Rocca Bruna" tower was the one of the highest towers in the city in competition with the tower of Mangia, located not so far from Piazza del Campo. Like most of Siena's towers, it was "shortened" in the sixteenth century. It has belonged to the Marconi family, the Biringucci and the Tommasi, then the noble Mino Campioni from the early eighteenth century, and finally passed to the Sansedoni, owners of the nearby palace. Regarding the origin of the tower's name various hypotheses have been made: one concerns a possible ancient name of the Montone valley, like the Selvata Bruna valley.
Ancient legends describe an underground link with Castelvecchio, Castel Montone and Camollia, which was later covered with rubble and used construction materials. The vestment on the cross of Travaglio is entirely in stone, gray, with a crenellated crowning, affixed after the shortening.
Nowadays the tower and its apartments are privately owned by a noble Senese family and they rent it for events and celebrations.

Lady Margaret Sackville (1562–1591)

Lady Margaret Sackville (1562 – 19 August 1591), formerly Lady Margaret Howard, was the wife of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset.
Margaret was the daughter of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and his second wife, the former Margaret Audley. In keeping with family tradition, she was a devout Roman Catholic. Her half-brother, Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel, died while imprisoned by Queen Elizabeth I of England, and was later canonised.
Her mother died when she was still a child, and in 1572 her father was executed, after which she was raised by her uncle Henry Howard. She married Robert Sackville in February 1580, but died prior to his inheriting the earldom of Dorset in 1608, and thus she was never countess. 
In 1585, she visited her sister-in-law, the Countess of Arundel, formerly Anne Dacre, in Essex; the countess's movements were restricted because of the earl's imprisonment. Lady Margaret was under instructions from the queen not to remain at the countess's home for more than one night. Both women were heavily pregnant and Lady Margaret went into labour during the visit, giving birth successfully. 
The children of Robert and Margaret Sackville included:
Lady Margaret died suddenly on 19 August 1591, aged 29, at Knole, Kent, a property which had been granted to her husband's father by Queen Elizabeth during the 1560s. Robert Southwell's "Triumphs over Death" (published in 1596, after the poet's execution) was dedicated to her and her surviving children; it was supposedly written and sent to her half-brother, the Earl of Arundel, in prison, to comfort him.
The year after her death, Dorset married the twice-widowed Anne, daughter of Sir John Spencer of Althorp. He left instructions in his will that he should be buried at Withyham, "as near to my first dearly beloved wife ... as can be".

Ana Uribe

Ana Uribe is a muralist and painter originally from Colombia, who lives and works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She has created multiple murals as part of the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program, many of them in poorer neighborhoods of Philadelphia.
Biography.
Born in Colombia, Uribe grew up in Medellín, Colombia. She took lessons in painting from Mariela Ochoa and Libe de Zulategüi. After studying architecture at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, she moved to Philadelphia in 1973 to attend Moore College of Art and Design in the United States. After she graduated in 1977, Uribe spent time in the Andes.
Uribe painted a mural, "Sunflowers, a Tribute to Aimee Willard," in Hope Garden Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1999. It is part of the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program. Another mural, on Fifth and Berks streets in Philadelphia is "Tropical Landscape With Waterfall" (1999). The mural includes a large waterfall, at the request of the community, who wanted the flowing water "to show how things were going to be cleaned up and get better."
Also in 1999, she exhibited "Tangled Paint" at the Salon des Amis Gallery. "The Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote that the pictures in the show together had "vigor, with an expressionist style as the vehicle for strong emotions and emphatic statements."
In 2006, "The Philadelphia Inquirer" listed her mural, "Magic Wall" (2006) as number three in a list of the city's best murals.
Also in 2006, she collaborated with disabled consumers of JEVS Human Services in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia to paint a mural titled "Ability to Fly", inspired by the style of Marc Chagall. The building where this mural was painted was destroyed by arson in 2009. In an interview for the Community College of Philadelphia, Uribe explains in Spanish that some of her mural art works have not survived due to fire or demolition.
Uribe's mural, "The Palm Tree", received a prize from the Philadelphia Green program, and is based on a garden located in Medellín.
Uribe was included with four other artists in the group show "Colombians: Between Emotion, Nation and Imagination", at the Cambridge Multicultural Arts Center, curated by Shaari Neretin and Angela Perez Mejia in 2001 with the support of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and the Colombian Consulate in Boston.
In 2011, she was part of "The Women of Lancaster Avenue", a curated exhibition that was part of the public art project "LOOK! on Lancaster Avenue", sponsored by Drexel University.
In October 2016 she exhibited her work as part of the Chestnut Hill Fall for the Arts Festival.
Ana Uribe's return visit to her native region of Antioquia Colombia was recorded in the 2010 documentary "El Rayo (The Ray)" by Laurence Salzmann.

Darley Park

Darley Park is an urban park on the banks of the River Derwent, just north of Derby City Centre, England, United Kingdom. It has a total area of 80 acres and forms the largest part of the Darley Open Spaces. The park is one of Derby's most popular outdoor spaces.
Description.
The name Darley Park is often used to describe all or the separate parts that make up the Darley Open Spaces; a number of adjacent urban park areas that lie on either side of the banks of the River Derwent, at the gateway to the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. They are; Darley Park, Derwent Park, Parker’s Piece, Chester Green, Darley Fields and Nutwood Nature Reserve.
At 80 acres, Darley Park is the largest of the areas. It is formed largely of steep bank that has a rise from the river level of about 30m.
There are five main entrances to the Park, the closest to Derby city centre being at the southern point, off North Parade. Here there is also Handyside Bridge which offers a pedestrian route over to Parkers Piece and Chester Green. 
Darley Park can also be accessed from the adjacent Derwent Park via pathways that lead from Duffield Road and Belper Road. There are two entrances from Darley Abbey Village; one off New Road and one at the northern point of the Park, next to Deans Field. 
There are two official car parks for the park, one at the Darley Road entrance and one at Deans Field. Both of these car parks are free to use. 
History.
In 1929 the Evans family, who were the local mill owners, donated the land Darley Park stands on to the people of Derby. The park had its official opening by the Duke of Kent on 30 June 1931. Nearby Markeaton Park was also opened later that day. Thousands of people attended the opening, including around 4,000 local children. 
Included in the grounds was a Georgian mansion, however, this was demolished in the '60s due to the building being unsafe. The site of the mansion was flattened and a paved garden was installed, in addition to the gardens that were already in place. Some of the bricks from the original mansion were used in the construction of the pillars that make up the tearooms outdoor seating area today.
Gardens.
Darley Park is home to largest collection of Hydrangeas in Britain, and the third largest in the world. First planted in 1984 it now has over 400 different types and is constantly expanding. Since April 2010 the collection has been maintained in partnership with a subgroup of Friends of Darley Open Spaces (FoDOS) called Hydrangea Derby.
The Hydrangea Derby project is helped by volunteers who plant, maintain and catalogue the collection. Open days are held each summer to showcase the collection and a free guided tour is provided. There is a butterfly garden situated next to the hydrangea collection which boast an array of butterflies in the summer months. 
Events.
The Darley Park Concert is held annually in the park and is hosted by Derby Live. The natural amphitheatre landscape allows spectators to view down to a temporary stage set up and there is a firework finale.  The concert was previously Europe’s largest free outdoor concert, however as of 2018 there has been admission fees in place. The concert was temporarily moved to Castle Donington in 2017 due to council funding issues.
In 2012 the park hosted the end of day 42 in the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.
Facilities.
Darley Park Tearooms occupies the old school building, that was once part of the mansion, and has a terraced area that has views across the park and the city beyond. Darley Abbey Cricket Club has its ground and pavilion in the park. The club plays in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, Divisions 4 South, 7 South and 4 North. Derby Rowing Club is located at the south end of the park. It has a function room that can be hired out for events.
Future Proposals.
In February 2018 a controversial approval was made for the ‘Construction of a multi user path and ancillary works’. The proposal is for a boarded path to run from near the Abbey Inn to the Rowing Club, following the route of the river. There has been much opposition by park users as to whether the path is necessary and will detract from the scenic surrounds. Those in agreement with the path say that it will give the park increased access and provide a suitable cycle route towards the city centre.

Dr. Lauren Pinter-Brown v. Regents of the University of California, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC624838, was a case in which the jury awarded a $13 million verdict against the University of California in a sex discrimination and retaliation case.
The jury found that UCLA discriminated against Pinter-Brown based on her gender and retaliated against her. The $13 million verdict was delivered in Judge Michael Linfield's courtroom on February 15, 2018, after approximately 14 days of trial. The jury found that Pinter-Brown deserved $3 million in lost earnings and $10 million in damages for emotional distress.
Dr. Lauren Pinter-Brown started working at UCLA's medical center as the director of its lymphoma program in 2005. She received excellent peer reviews and awards throughout her tenure. Pinter-Brown began raising concerns about being harassed by a male colleague but was subsequently targeted in audits. She later had her research privileges suspended and her title damaged.
According to court documents, UCLA made no significant efforts to fix the problem filing verbal and written complaints. Pinter-Brown was forced to “play dead” at work to avoid additional conflicts. She eventually resigned from her position in 2015.
At trial, UCLA argued that Pinter-Brown mischaracterized the harassment, and contended the alleged conduct were her not getting along with the alleged harasser. UCLA further asserted that it properly handled her reports of harassment through the internal grievance process.
The California Court of Appeal’s Second Appellate District reversed the lower court's decision in April 2020.

Swish (payment)

Swish ( or ) is a mobile payment system in Sweden. The service was launched in 2012 by six large Swedish banks, in cooperation with Bankgirot and the Central Bank of Sweden. It had 7.9 million users as of April 2021 (total Swedish population: 10.2 million). Swish is a member of the European Mobile Payment Systems Association.
The service works through a smartphone application, through which the user's phone number is connected to their bank account, and which makes it possible to transfer money in real time, a few seconds until confirmation is received by both parties. The user must have a second mobile application called "Mobilt BankID Säkerhetsapp", which is an electronic identification issued by several banks in Sweden. This requires that the user has a bank account in a Swedish bank participating in the system, and also a national ID number. Users who have a Swedish bank account but no suitable phone can register for reception only of payments. The phone number can be of another country. The actual transfer is done by the Bankgirot clearing system, which developed instant payments for the Swish system.
Swish was originally intended for transactions between individuals, but soon it started to be used for flea markets and collections at church services, and by sports clubs and other organisations as payment at small events where a credit card reader would be too expensive or otherwise impractical. Small companies who wished to avoid credit card charges and simplify online payments soon followed suit. In 2014 organisations could register for receiving payments, although some organisations used a private bank account of someone in the organisation before that. In January 2017 Swish was launched for web based sales which quickly became popular, for example used by the train operator SJ. It is possible to pay by scanning a QR code.
Prior to the implementation of Swish, cash was the primary means for many of these types of real-time transactions. As such, Swish is used for transactions that used to be mostly cash-based.
The service is free for private users since the start 2012. Companies and registered organisations pay around 1–3 SEK (depending on bank) per received payment in addition to a small yearly fee, and are not allowed to charge the customer for their Swish fee. The fees are decided by each bank for the reason of not limiting price competition, considering that Swish has a near monopoly on instant phone payments in Sweden. Since the minimum Swish payment (currently 1 SEK but depends on the bank) may be lower than the fee, an organisation may lose money if many small Swish payments are made to it. In some cases of media attention towards such cases banks have donated their Swish profit to the organisations.

Anne Sackville, Countess of Dorset

Anne Sackville, Countess of Dorset (died 22 September 1618), née Anne Spencer, was the second wife of Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset. Dorset was her third husband, the first two being William Stanley, 3rd Baron Monteagle, and Henry Compton, 1st Baron Compton, both of whom predeceased her.
She was the daughter of Sir John Spencer of Althorp and his wife, the former Katherine Kitson. She married Lord Monteagle as his second wife in September 1575. They had no children of their own, and he died in 1581.
She married Sir Henry Compton, as his second wife, within a few years of her first husband's death. They had one son, Sir Henry Compton, MP. Anne's second husband died in 1589. A revised version of Edmund Spenser's poem, "Mother Hubberd's Tale", published in 1590, was dedicated to Anne as "the Lady Compton and Mountegle".
Anne married the future earl on 4 December 1592, a year after the death of his first wife, the former Lady Margaret Howard. Whereas his first marriage had been a happy one, he described his second wife in his will as one "whom without great grief and sorrow inconsolable I cannot remember, in regard of her exceeding unkindness and intolerable evil usage towards myself and my late good lord and father deceased".
Dorset had complained about his second wife's "misconduct", and was considering a separation from her at the time of his death. However, Cecily, one of his daughters from his first marriage, married his stepson Henry Compton, by whom she had three children.

Bavarian Forest Club

The Bavarian Forest Club (), or BWV, is a German club that promotes culture, local history and folklore, nature and landscape conservation, and walking in the Bavarian Forest. It has its head office in Zwiesel and is registered in the register of clubs and societies in the district office at Deggendorf (VR 10158).
History.
The founder of the club was Anton Niederleuthner, senior judge in Passau. The foundation of the club in 1883 goes back to his meeting with foresters in Bodenmais. The Bavarian Forest Club was founded in Deggendorf Town Hall on 25 November 1883. The Bodenmais townsman, Bartholomäus Stölzl, was appointed as its first chairman. On 6 June 1885, Niederleuthner founded the Passau Branch, the club's first local branch. On 22 August he was elected the first president and made Passau the base of the club. He managed the club for over 20 years and founded over 40 other local branches. The club emblem used today goes back to Niederleuthner.
A club magazine, "Der Bayerwald", was also launched. Its editor in the 1930s was the Nazi, Eugen Hubrich.
The main goals of the club were the development of the Bavarian Forest as a hiking and holiday area, the creation of a dense network of hiking trails and the construction of refuge huts. Later they concentrated on the maintenance and waymarking of trails, the conservation of refuge huts and viewing towers as well as measures such as the protection of the "Schachten", the historical grazing areas of the highlands. Until the founding of the Bavarian Forest Nature Park in 1967 and the Bavarian Forest National Park in 1970, the Bavarian Forest Club was the only major institution that placed the culture and nature of the Bavarian Forest at the centre of its activities.
Today.
In 2016, the club comprised 60 branches and had about 20,000 members. The individual branches own important buildings and refuge huts. For example, Kollnburg Castle and Neunußberg Castle are owned by the Viechtach branch, and the "Lusenschutzhaus" by the Grafenau branch. Important annual events include the "Bayerwaldtag" (Bavarian Forest Day) and the art exhibition, "Zwieseler Buntspecht", in Zwiesel. On the Oberbreitenau a youth education centre has been created in the Landshut House named after the Landshut branch.
On 26 October 2008, the club celebrated its 125th anniversary in the festival hall of the old town hall of Deggendorf. Minister of State, Josef Miller, gave the speech at the spot where the Bavarian Forest Club was founded on 25 November 1883.
Since early 2016, the club has become a member of the German Hiking Association, to which it had already previously belonged until its departure on 31 December 2006. In the interim, the "Interessensgemeinschaft Bayerischer Wald", consisting of the Dreiburgenland and Ruderting-Neukirchen branches, was a member of the German Hiking Association from June 2008 to the end of 2013.

Castillo de Coca

The Castle of Coca is a castle located in the Coca municipality, central Spain. The castle was constructed in the 15th century and has been considered to be one of the best examples of Spanish Mudejar brickwork which incorporates Moorish Muslim design and construction with Gothic architecture. A scale model of the castle has been built in the Mudéjar theme park and another replica built at a ratio of 1:25 is placed in the Minimundus miniature park in Klagenfurt, Austria.
Location.
Coca Castle is located on the outskirts of the town of Coca, about 45 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Segovia, on a slope. It overlooks the meander of the River Voltoya, a tributary of River Eresma. It is one of the few Spanish castles that have not been constructed on hilltops; rather it has been constructed on a steep esplanade. Coca is the birthplace of the Roman Emperor Theodosius I. The site has been inhabited since the second century BC when the Arevaci arrived and settled here. The castle is surrounded by a deep and wide moat that is one of the fortifying features as well.
Ownership.
Coca castle was owned by the well-known Spanish aristocratic family the House of Alba de Tormes (sometimes known as the House of Alba) until the mid-twentieth century. They handed over the property to Ministry of Agriculture in 1954. It has been declared a Spanish National Monument and is under protection.
Construction and architecture.
The castle was constructed under the supervision of a Moorish architect and engineer. Such Moorish engineers were routinely commissioned to construct large buildings during the medieval times and were called "Alarife" (one who understand the art of construction). Brick has been used for most of the construction. However, the bricks used in the castle are different from ordinary bricks used to build houses. These are hardened bricks that are capable of withstanding enemy onslaught during sieges. The bricks have been laid smooth with the mortar, so the lines of the brickwork are clearly visible along with the mortar. This creates a distinctive pattern on the castle. The castle has been constructed in classic Mudéjar fashion. Brickwork and plaster work have been used to create geometrical patterns depicting a hybrid of Moorish Muslim and Christian Gothic architecture. While the main construction is of brick, limestone and plaster have been used in the balistraria, the embrasures. White limestone has also been used to decorate columns in the courtyard and the keep, as well as numerous other features on the facade of the keep.
Design and fortifications.
The ground plan of the castle is rectangular, and it has a three-tiered defence system consisting of wall circuits enclosed within a moat and a central keep. The central keep is situated in the northern part of the castle and is known as the Tower of Homage. There are two curtain walls that enclose the enceinte, but the outer curtain wall is not intact. Today there are traces of the outer curtain wall, as well as a number of towers – some in ruins others standing – that mark the boundary where the outer moat circled the castle. All of the outer towers were rectangular in shape. The second curtain wall has a gate near the inner keep with a high brick arch enclosed by a geometric border, the alfiz, which is a classic Moorish design feature. The inner curtain wall has several towers and a talus as well. It has centered cylindrical towers on each side and smaller turrets between them, while the talus is constructed all the way down to the moat.
The towers on the corners of the walls are rectangular. The surviving wall is machicolated. This coupled with the talus served as a formidable defence. The battlements on the walls have been constructed as both ornament and as defensive fortifications, so they have been built with crests that jut out from the walls. Brickwork in Mudejar has been used here as well.
History.
Early history.
The oldest settlements in Coca date back to the Chalcolithic era, around 2,500–2,300 BC. The abundance of natural water and the geographical features were important for early settlers. In the fifth century CE, the village grew substantially, forming the historic city of Coca. The town of Coca was first established during Roman rule. It was called Cauca at that time. In 1439 Coca came under the control of Marquis of Santillana. In 1451 negotiations between Santillana and Fonseca families started. These would later culminate in 1453 with Coca being exchanged for Saldaña. Construction of the Coca Castle began as soon as the treaty was ratified by Juan II.
Medieval history.
Alonso de Fonseca y Avellaneda has been credited with the construction of the castle. The castle was built under the supervision of a master builder and most of the work had been completed by 1493. In 1502 it was decreed that castle and the town could only be passed down to male heirs, so after Alonso's death it passed on to Antonio de Fonseca. In 1512 a number of extra ornamental features were added to the keep and the castle exterior under the supervision of engineers. The castle came under attack during the Revolt of the Comuneros in 1521. Communeras troops attacked the castle in retaliation to the burning of Medina del Campo. Medina del Campo had been previously attacked by the Royalists as it housed a large number of artillery pieces, and it had subsequently been razed after Royalists met heavy resistance. In 1645, Gaspar Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia was accused to treachery after he instigated the Andalusian independentist conspiracy of 1641, and was imprisoned in the castle.
The castle went through a period of repairs and renovations from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century CE. Most notable among these renovations was the addition of the Patio de Armas in sixteenth century, the construction of a gallery between the Keep (Torres del Homenaje) and Pedro Mata Tower in the seventeenth century CE and the extensive renovations of 1715. After 1730 the castle suffered a long period of neglect that led to it falling into disrepair, and subsequently many important artifacts were either lost or destroyed. During the Peninsular War, Coca Castle was captured by the French, who occupied the castle in 1808 and vacated it in 1812. During these four years the castle further deteriorated and much of it fell into ruin. The French troops were, obviously, not concerned with the upkeep of the castle and many ornamental features fell into ruin during this time. Another incident that led to the castle falling further into ruin was the 1828 sale of materials by the administrator of the castle. As the castle was under the ownership of the House of Alba at that time, the owners tore away a number of columns, marble pieces and other ornamental features and sold them off to the highest bidder.
Modern history.
Coca Castle was declared a national monument of Spain by Decree-Law on August 9, 1926. By the same decree, it was nationalized. The control of the castle itself and the adjoining land was taken over by the government of Spain from the House of Alba. No major restorative work was done until 1954 when state-sponsored repairs and renovations were started. The Ministry in charge of the castle wanted to restore it so that they could open a school of forestry training. The repair and renovation work was conducted under the supervision of the Spanish avante garde architect Miguel de los Santos Nicolás. The team of architects, which included Francisco Pons Sorolla was given carte blanche by the General Directorate of Fine Arts. The renovations took four years and were completed in 1958. After the renovations the "Escuela de Capacitación Forestal" (Forestry school) was opened in 1958.
Locations open to tourists.
There are several rooms in Coca Castle that are open for tourists. These include the following:
Chapel.
The ceiling of the chapel was destroyed in a fire during the French occupation of the castle. However it was restored later on and has now been completely renovated. There are various art objects present in the chapel that are of historic importance. These include: 
Weapons room.
The armory is also open to public viewing. It contains metal armor and weapons belonging to the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The furniture displayed in the armory is original and dates back to the fifteenth and sixteenth century CE. Most of it is made from walnut wood, with bone and ivory columns.
Central keep.
Also known as the Torre del Homenaje, it contains the Gallery and the 25-meter high tower. The circuitry walkway 'Paseo de Ronda' is also connected to the keep. It contains the defensive structures that were used in active defence such as pulleys and oil smelters.
Rebuilt portions.
Columns from the balustrade were sold off by the administrators when the castle was in disrepair in order to pay for the upkeep. Eight of these were bought back from Olmedo and Iscar in 1952 for 35,000-40,000 pesetas, each. The balustrade has now been completely rebuilt identical to the original one.

Lamy Building

The Lamy Building, also known as St. Michael's Dormitory, is a historic building in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was built in 1878 as the main building of St. Michael's College, the predecessor of St. Michael's High School and the College of Santa Fe. The building is a contributing property in the Barrio De Analco Historic District and currently serves as the headquarters of the New Mexico Tourism Department.
History.
St. Michael's College was established at the behest of Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, who had arrived in New Mexico in 1851 to find that formal schooling in the territory was nonexistent. After establishing the Loretto Academy for girls in 1852, Lamy recruited the De La Salle Christian Brothers to open a similar school for boys, and St. Michael's held its first classes in the fall of 1859. In the 1870s, the school appointed a new leader, Brother Botulph, who oversaw its growth into an institution of higher learning. Under Botulph, St. Michael's began offering high school diplomas, and later, teaching certificates. In 1874 it received a charter from the territorial legislature, making it the oldest chartered college in New Mexico. The college eventually phased out its post-secondary courses but continued to operate as St. Michael's High School, while a new St. Michael's College was established at a separate campus in 1947.
In 1877, Brother Botulph started a fundraising campaign to construct a new building for the school which netted sheep, goats, and cattle in addition to cash and building materials. Ground was broken on the building in April 1878 and it was ready for classes by November. The first two stories were constructed from adobe, while the third floor was wood-framed to save weight. In 1926, the wooden upper story was destroyed by a fire, reducing the building to its present two-story height. After this, it remained in use as a dormitory but was vacated when St. Michael's moved to a new campus in 1966. The building was sold to the state of New Mexico and renamed in honor of Archbishop Lamy; it now houses the New Mexico Tourism Department. It was remodeled in the Territorial Revival style in the 1950s, adding brick coping and a bellcote to the parapet. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1968 as a contributing property in the Barrio De Analco Historic District. 
Architecture.
In its present form, the building is a nearly symmetrical two-story adobe structure, in length by in width with a two-story Territorial Style "portal" or veranda wrapping around the north and east sides. The original wooden third floor had a mansard roof with evenly spaced dormer windows, a gambrel-roofed cross-gable above the main entrance, and a tall tower. After the fire in 1926, the building was truncated at the second floor with a flat roof. The present brick coping and bellcote were added during a 1950s remodeling.

Vehicle registration plates of Belize

Belize requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates. Current plates are North American standard 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm).
Originally, Belize was a crown colony of Great Britain named British Honduras when license plates were first issued. In 1964 British Honduras was granted self government, and then in 1973 the country was renamed Belize. The 1973 license plates were the first to have the name Belize on them. Full independence from Great Britain took plate on 21 September 1981. The initials "C.A." on the plates stand for "Central America."
Location codes.
The following table shows the abbreviations used on license plates for each of the six administrative districts in Belize.
There are also several cities that have their own codes. These are shown in the table below. Because they are known as the "Twin Towns" the codes for San Ignatio and Santa Elena both appear on the same license plate.

Vehicle registration plates of Costa Rica

Costa Rica requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates. The country has issued plates since at least 1923. The letters "CR" on plates into the early 1940s indicated the country name. The country name has been spelled out on the plates since at least 1944. In 1959 the legend "Centro America" [Central America] has appeared on the plates. Annual plates appear to have been issued through at least 1954. There were plates where the first two characters indicated what city the owner lived in. Multi-year base plates began to appear in 1955, but their use was not consistent until the mid-1960s. The current plate size is the North American standard of 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm).
2013 Series.
New license plates for all vehicle were issued starting in mid 2013 and continuing until completed in early 2015. The design of these plates included additional security features, such as a hologram at the left side, a security strip running across the plate, and additional elements that are now found throughout most countries.

Central School (Pontiac, Michigan)

Central School is a former school building located at 101 East Pike Street in Pontiac, Michigan. It is the oldest remaining school building in Pontiac. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
History.
Pontiac's Union School was built on this site in 1853. The Union School was demolished in 1893, and this building was constructed in its place. The building was constructed for $12,000 by H. Heitsch, a local builder/contractor. It was designed to accommodate 320 students in eight classrooms, four per floor, for students in grades 1–8. An addition was constructed in 1917, designed to be compatible with the original building. A second, more contemporary addition was constructed in 1957.
By the 1980s, the school housed the adult education and job placement program of the Pontiac School District. By the 2000s it was vacant.
Description.
Central School is a two-and-one-half story Richardsonian Romanesque brick structure situated on a small hill near Pontiac's central business district. The building is topped with a steeply-pitched hip roof with projecting side gables and hipped dormers. The main facade is dominated by a four-story, pyramid-roofed central projecting tower. The main entrance is located in the base of the tower. Secondary entrances are at the sides underneath the dormers. The 1917 addition continues the materials, scale and detailing of the original structure.

Bad Match

Bad Match is a 2017 American thriller film written and directed by David Chirchirillo. The film follows Harris, an online dating man, who meets a woman with an unpredictable temperament.
Plot.
Harris is an average man who regularly uses an online dating service to seduce women into hookups and then proceeds to ghost them the next morning. On one such date, he meets Riley Miller. When Harris attempts, as usual, to leave before Riley wakes up the next morning, she wakes and tries persistently to get him to stay longer. Harris eventually talks his way into leaving. During the course of the following day, Riley repeatedly texts Harris at work, much to his annoyance. That night, he initially attempts to complete a project for work, but invites Riley over after she sends a nude image. They once again have sex, and she stays the night. The next morning, Harris wakes to a phone call from his job informing him that he missed an important presentation. Riley mentions she accidentally silenced his alarms hours ago and apologizes. Harris, upset, leaves in a hurry, trusting Riley to see herself out.
At work, he manages to smooth things over with his boss Terri Webster, although she isn't pleased. As the day goes on, Riley continues to call and text Harris with apologies, although he ignores her. Upon returning home at the end of the day, Harris is shocked to discover Riley still in his apartment, cooking an apology dinner for him. He sends Riley home, but fails to express to her that he doesn't wish to see her again. He spends the rest of the night playing video games with a teenager online. Their trash-talk gets heated, causing the teenager to leave the game abruptly. Riley continues to call Harris throughout the night and he continues to ignore her. The next day, Harris hangs out with his friends at a bar. Eventually, Riley becomes the topic of conversation and Harris describes her as a lunatic who he slept with twice against his better judgement. Riley, who tracked Harris down via Facebook, overhears this, makes a scene, then storms out, indicating she doesn't want to see him again.
The next day, Riley repeatedly tries to get in contact with Harris, threatening suicide if Harris doesn't "rescue" her. Harris goes to Riley's apartment, finding her seemingly dead on the floor. However, she reveals it was a malicious prank. Harris is furious, shattering a mirror and storming out. The next day, Harris's boss informs him that his Twitter account was hacked, and he is fired as a result. The following day, the police arrest Harris after discovering child pornography on his computer that Harris was unaware of. Harris is convinced Riley is responsible for him getting fired and for downloading the child pornography onto his computer and realizes that a confession is likely the only way for him to avoid prison time. He goes to Riley's apartment, intending to get her to confess while recording their conversation. Riley apologizes for faking her suicide, but refuses to acknowledge hacking his Twitter account or downloading child pornography onto his computer. Harris, frustrated, gets violent, but leaves once Riley screams out for help. The following day, Riley files a restraining order against Harris.
Harris, still determined to get Riley to confess, lures her away from her friends with a fake Facebook account, drugs her, then kidnaps her. He tries to get her to confess at knifepoint and she agrees, although seems confused as to what she's supposed to confess to. She convinces Harris to untie her so she can reapply makeup, pointing out that no one will believe a confession video if she looks disheveled. Once Harris unties her, she attacks him, eventually gaining the upper hand and striking his head repeatedly with a golf club, apparently killing him. Riley leaves into the parking lot but can't find a way past the parking lot's locked gates. She turns around and is suddenly stabbed in the chest and killed by a still-alive Harris.
After Riley dies, Harris begins wondering why Riley refused to simply confess. He receives a call from his lawyer informing him that all charges have been dropped due to a confession by the teenager from Harris's online video game whom he'd insulted, named Keenan. As Harris processes this, a security guard discovers Harris, his face revealed to be heavily damaged, and Riley's body and calls the police.
Release.
The film was released on November 3, 2017.
Reception.
On Metacritic the movie holds a 56% among critics, indicating "mixed reviews". On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 100% among critics based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" said the film was "a toxic master of the digital hookup gets his comeuppance in a tawdry but watchable low-budget "Fatal Attraction" for the age of Tinder". John Defore of "The Hollywood Reporter" also compared the film to "Fatal Attraction", saying it was a "nightmare of modern dating". Noel Murray said the film "unleashes a fatal attraction for the Tinder set".

Glasgow University Muslim Students Association

The Glasgow University Muslim Students Association (GUMSA, pronounced "gəmsjɑː") is an Islamic society aimed at catering for Muslim and non-Muslim students at the University of Glasgow. GUMSA was established in 1968, it is one of the largest societies on the university campus as well as being the oldest Muslim student organisation in Scotland and one of the oldest in the United Kingdom.
History.
see also "Past Presidents and committee members of GUMSA"
1968–1973 (Founding Fathers).
The society was founded on 11 November 1968 under the guidance of Professor Salah Shahin from Paisley University (now University of the West of Scotland) who approached a group of youth at the University of Glasgow informing them that they should form a student organisation for Muslim youth at the University. On 11 November 1968, the inaugural meeting for the society took place in the Glasgow University Union extension. The meeting was advertised in the Glasgow University Guardian. The extract emphasised the inclusivity and openness of the society:"Dear Sir, The inaugural meeting of the Glasgow University Muslims Students' Association was held in the Union Extension on 11/11/68.The Association aims to provide a meeting place for the many Muslim Students at Glasgow University, from different parts of the world and also a forum for discussion for discussion with other interested student bodies at Glasgow, and thereby help to foster a better spirit of understanding. The Association, therefore, cordially extends an invitation to ALL students to their weekly meetings.For further information please contact:Mr Mohamed Aslam Ebrahim,The Secretary,Glasgow University Students' Association c/o Mens' Union" The group of individuals kept GUMSA running for its first four years, but elections did not take place. Since social media and e-mail had yet to come into existence, publicity was achieved through the medium of hand written flyers which were posted across campus. The group also ventured between different faculties inviting all to attend the GUMSA meetings.
Meetings would take place on a monthly basis, with roughly 20-25 individuals attending and different speakers being invited to speak. The University granted a space for meetings, but contact was limited to this. The society was met with no resistance and had regular interfaith contact, particularly with the Christian Union. "Iftaars" for the breaking of fast were held for the community in Ramadhan. With members at the time being unaware of funding available, they would bring home-cooked food for these events.
In the same year of founding, the first Scottish President of the Federation of Student Islamic Societies was elected - Aziz Khan - who was also a GUMSA member.
In 1971, GUMSA members helped to form their sister society at the University of Strathclyde, which would go on to be known as The Strathclyde University Muslim Students Association (SUMSA).
1974–1976.
Following the departure of the founding members of the society, the organisation began to dwindle in size. Whilst substantial efforts were made to keep it running, the society underwent periods of inactivity, notably in 1973 following the departure of the founder- Dr Ibrahim and again in 1976 following the departure of the President of 3 years, Dr Mahmoud Akhtar.
1978–1987.
Little information is available for this period of time, with speculation that some years may have had little to no activity. it is known that in 1978 the President and secretary of the society were Mohammed El-Mahdi and Riaz Ahmed respectively.
Following this, from 1978 - 1987 it is known that the society was run by predominantly by students who had come from Malaysia to seek an education at the University. Unfortunately the current society has been unable to reach out to these members, despite numerous attempts.
1987–1991.
In 1987, leadership came from an individual who has gone on to become a prominent member of the academic circle in Malaysia - Prof Dr Mohd Tengku Sembok.
The following year would bring a change which had never before been seen in the history of GUMSA; as grants given by the Malaysian government to study overseas began to run dry, the society would be overtaken by individuals who were both born and brought up in the city of Glasgow. This led to the dawn of a new era in the society; individuals who were brought up in the city and considered Scotland their home were more comfortable challenging societal norms and standing face to face with the status quo. As such the first recorded GUMSA member to run for elections in the Students' representative council was elected - Dr Majid Anwar - the President of GUMSA at the time, was elected as the representative for the faculty of medicine.
Despite the new energy the organisation had found, its sister organisation - SUMSA - was much larger than it, and it was consistently struggling to gain prominence in light of the much more popular 'GUAsia' to which most individuals of South Asian descent would favour over GUMSA.
The society had membership cards (pictured is the card of the treasurer at the time - Shahed Quayum).
The society co-wrote a fortnightly newsletter with its sister organisation from Strathclyde University - SUMSA.
In 1990, under the new leadership of Zaid Akhtar, the society managed for the first time to allow halal food to be served in the University canteen. For a variety of reasons, the society had little to no female involvement at this time.
1991–1992.
Whilst there was no pause in GUMSA's running between the academic session of '90 and '91, there was no communication between the individuals who took over the society in this period and those who preceded them. The society at this time was run by 2 individuals who had previously never been to a GUMSA event - Ruzwan Mohammed and Zahid Hanif. With little to work with, the society had to be started from scratch.
The society made hoodies for the first time (see picture of "Shaykh Ruzwan Mohammed" in photo gallery below), but as was common, had little engagement when compared with the Pakistani society of the time. Ruzwan, who served as the "chairman" at the time, made a concerted effort to keep in contact with the society following his departure from the University and was delivering lectures for the society as little as 7 years later in 1999. He continues to hold a yearly class for the society.
1994–1999.
Following a short period of inactivity GUMSA would soon be taken over by some of the most active members it has seen to date. The society again had to start from scratch with initial meetings taking place in a mosque off the University campus on Oakfield Avenue. Many large events were held by the committee in this period such as in the University Bute hall with renowned nasheed artist yusuf islam (formerly Cat Stevens) and ground breaking lectures "Islam: Oppressed or Oppressive" and a unique play titled "The return of Salahudeen" featuring prominent figures in the Muslim community. Prominent Muslim speaker Imam Siraj Wahhaj also visited the society to speak, the event took place on the Glasgow University Campus in the Wellington Church. The era saw the society make a website for its first time – a feat which was a rare achievement for the time period- Imran Kausar learned how to code and apply website design language in the University's first (and only) computer lab in order to bring the site to life.
Following a trip to London for the "Islam and Science" conference which was delivered by Prof Salim Al-Hassani, a crash led to the minibus (which was hired from the Students' Representative Council) being written off. The society was not allowed to hire the minibus for a number of years following this incident.
The period also became one of the most politically active the society has seen. Many members ran for positions within the Students' Representative Council (SRC) - particularly for positions within the council executive committee, below is a summary:
Around this time period GUMSA helped another of its sister organisations to form - CUMSA (Caledonian University Muslim Students Organisation), which would grow into another prominent and active society within Muslim community of Glasgow.
The general secretary of the society was Dr Azhar Ali, during these years Dr Ali also went on to revive the FOSIS Scotland branch. Since his University days he has gone on to become the executive director of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) in America).
The period was also the first time in which the society held an "Islam Awareness Week", which it continues to hold to this day. The week involved interfaith events which were amongst the first being held in Scotland at that time.
2000-2004.
2003 saw the first big change in the logo used by the organisation. A GUMSA member - Maarya Sharif sketched a design of someone in "sujood" or 'prostration' as Muslims do when they carry out their 5 daily prayers. The logo was then uploaded to a digital format from the sketch. This iteration of the logo was used 2003-2016, yet the concept of a Muslim in prostration continued onto the next logo version.
On Friday 6 July 2007 Aijaz Mohammad (who was President in 2003) won the "Male Inspirational Young Scottish Muslim Award" at the inaugural "Young Scottish Muslims Conference &amp; Awards". He was awarded for his work in numerous organisations, among them his role as "chair of GUMSA."
In 2003, the society was once again started, almost from scratch due to lack of proper progression planning.
2005-2007.
In 2005 GUMSA saw President Humza Yousaf MSP take lead of the society. He has since gone on to become the Minister for Europe and Development, Minister for Transport and the Islands and Cabinet Secretary for Justice.
The first 'Interfaith Dinner' was also held, one of GUMSA's biggest events which attracts people of all faith and none to come together and enjoy a free 3 course meal courtesy of the society. The event has become of the society's annual calendar during "Islam Awareness Week."
Reverend Leith Fisher, who was formerly the minister at the nearby Wellington Church, passed away whilst fundraising for GUMSA in these years. The cause was raising funds for Palestine.
In 2006 the society started focusing more on charitable activities, in particular "Water Wells Week" for which the organisation helped fund water wells in impoverished areas in the developing world. The society raised a total of £10,000 in just one week.
The society held their first 'outdoor' prayer near the library during "Islam Awareness Week" as part of an ongoing project to make people more aware of Muslim forms of worship.
In 2007 the 'Interfaith room' was introduced as the first full-time place of worship on the University campus, after needs were seen for it by the interfaith chaplain at the time, Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie.
2008-2012.
In 2008 whilst Ahmed Shaikh was President, the society saw a number of improvements for Muslim students on campus.
The first library prayer room was established in this time period on level 3 of the main Glasgow University library. Prior to this students were praying in corridors and in stairwells which led to the University Chaplain Reverend Stuart Macquarrie commissioning the new space. The space has since moved many times within the building and has also seen the introduction of complimentary ablution facilities. Discussions also began for a space in the dental school which would be made 3 years later.
The society also hosted the first year round Islamic course in Glasgow - ISyllabus, the course was taught by two of the UK's most prominent Islamic thinkers - Shaykh Ruzwan Mohammed (who was President of GUMSA in 1990) and Shaykh Amer Jamil (who had been the Vice-President of SUMSA) in the University's Boyd Orr Building. The course has been run in the University every year since, and has spread to other universities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Dundee, Edinburgh and has plans to move to London.
The University also started supplying halal chicken in official cafeterias across campus, this has vastly improved ease of consumption for Muslim students on campus.
The academic year 2008/09 also saw the society bring "Charity Week" (see "Activities") to Scotland. In this period over £50,000 was raised for orphans and needy children across the world. GUMSA has participated in Charity Week every year since.
Activities.
Freshers' Week.
Freshers' week takes place a week before classes begin at the University of Glasgow. GUMSA traditionally hosts daily activities Monday - Saturday during this week including the following set-up:
Charity Week.
Every year in October, GUMSA participates in Charity week with Islamic societies (also known as 'isoc/isocs') across the UK to raise money for orphans and needy children. Activities change on a yearly basis, however in previous years these have included football tournaments, bake sales, speaker events as well as dinners. During this week GUMSA raised over £4,015.11 in 2017.
Islam Awareness Week.
Islam Awareness Week normally takes place in February with an aim of uniting the interfaith community of Glasgow University Campus. There is a stall daily during the week outside the Glasgow University Library for individuals to ask questions about Islam and find out more about the faith. The following events are also regular occurrences:
"Annual Interfaith Dinner".
The GUMSA Annual Interfaith Dinner has grown in repute in recent years, attracting hundreds of students of all faiths and none to a free three-course meal. In 2017, the dinner attracted Glasgow University Rector and prominent human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar as a keynote speaker. The dinner has helped developed bonds and has been praised for its role in interfaith dialogue on campus.
"Islam Awareness Week flag".
In 2017 for the first time the University flew the GUMSA flag as a tribute to the celebrations taking place during Islam Awareness week. The move was met with praise across campus.
Believe and Do Good Month.
In the month of February GUMSA participates in a national campaign in collaboration with FOSIS and Muslim Association of Britain which instructs its members to partake in activities that help the community and in general 'do good' based on the Quranic verse "Except those who Believe and Do Good Righteous Deeds. Theirs is a never ending reward" - Quran [95:6]. Previous activities have included graveyard clean ups and community blood donations. A particularly popular activity was the donation of knitted hats to a local hospital ward for newborns in 2018.
Annual Ramadan Iftaar.
GUMSA holds a yearly iftaar during the Islamic month of Ramadan. The iftaar has built up notoriety in recent years and has become the largest gathering of Muslims for the breaking of their fast in Scotland. The event is free to attend and is not limited to students or GUMSA members, with general members of the public outnumbering students. The leftover food is often donated to a local homeless shelter. In 2017 the event was attended by around 400 people. (See picture).
Friday Prayers.
The society organises weekly speakers ("khateebs") for the congregational prayer every Friday. Two prayer timings are provided so that students with class can have a larger chance of being able to attend. Notable regular speakers for the sermons include Ustadh Shoket Aksi, Shaykh Sohaib Saeed, Shaykh Amin Buxton Ustadh Zubeir Alvi, Ustadh Ahmed Shaikh &amp; Shaykh Amer Jamil.
Educational and religious activities.
GUMSA is involved in various other activities throughout the year. The society hosts "circles" weekly for individuals to come and speak about their faith, but also as an outlet away from University life. In recent years the society has also hosted reputable Muslim scholars from across the globe. Most notably these have included Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi, Mufti Ismail ibn Musa Menk, Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Shaykh Ruzwan Mohammed. The latter hosts a revision lecture series at GUMSA on a yearly basis. The society also hosts social events on a monthly basis ranging from tea nights to ice skating.
Academia.
GUMSA delivers free lectures and workshops for the subjects of medicine, dentistry engineering and certain science subjects during exam times (typically December and May). The society has built a reputation on campus for its proficient and easy to follow lectures.
Discount card.
In 2015 the Society released its "halal discount card." which was one of the first of its kind in the UK. GUMSA has since presented at numerous national conferences showing other societies how the card has been implemented and can be used as a means of both attracting individuals to the organisation as well as a means of revenue and income. The number of businesses taking part in the discount card scheme has increased exponentially from the first card having just 16 businesses to the current iteration which boasts over 50 halal outlets across Glasgow.
Awards.
Over the years the society has won a number of different awards from various bodies including, but not limited to, the following:
Past Presidents and committee members of GUMSA.
Committee Members (Past to Present).
The following is what has survived through various archives of GUMSA members present in different years.

Bruce Craig

Bruce Craig (born December 1962) is a businessperson, entrepreneur and owner of Bath Rugby club.
As of 2017, Craig has a net worth of £300 million, according to "The Sunday Times Rich List".
Early life.
Born in Bristol, Craig's father John Craig an English businessman worked for British American Tobacco.
Craig studied at St Brendan's College a Grammar School where he captained the 1st XV of the school's rugby team. He was chosen to represent the south of England at 18 but missed the U19 final England schools rugby trial due to a fractured leg.
Craig then studied Sport and Business management at Loughborough University achieving a Bachelor of Science degree.
Between 1987 and 1993, Craig played rugby for French team Racing Club de France.
Career.
Craig joined Marken, a logistics business founded in 1980, as a graduate.
In 1997 Marken was acquired for £2.5m by Ocean Group (later to become Exel Logistics and merge into Deutsche Post).
In 1999 Craig was appointed CEO of the Company, and from that point Craig led a number of successful management buyouts over a period of 10 years.
The first transaction in 2003 saw 3I venture capital enter into the shareholding of Marken for a price of £210m. 3i then exited the business for £420m after 2 years making £100m profit from the transaction. In 2005, Craig led a secondary management buyout with the backing of ICG. Craig and the management now owned a significant majority stake in the new business.
By this stage Marken had become a pharmaceutical support services company, specialising in transporting pharmaceutical products between clinical trials, research companies and biotechnology laboratories. It also distributed vaccines, clinical trial kits, and investigational drugs. It was growing revenues at more than 20 per cent a year.
In 2009, the company was bought by Apax Partners for £975 million. Apax aimed to finance the company’s continued expansion into emerging markets, such as Asia, South America, and central and eastern Europe. (This was the first major private equity transaction in the world after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial crash of 2008). Apax was understood to own some two thirds of the business and the management team much of the remainder. Craig continued to hold a minority stake. Craig stood back from the business as non-executive chairman to concentrate on other activities.
Rugby.
Bath Rugby.
In 2010, Craig acquired 100% of Bath Rugby and moved the club's administrative headquarters into Farleigh House, where the new training facilities were situated.
Craig also announced plans to build a new 18,000-capacity stadium for the club.
Between 2010-18 Craig is believed to have put £18m into Bath Rugby.
Future of rugby.
Craig has advocated for an integrated global rugby season.
Personal life.
Craig's wife Catherine is French, and they have two sons. They have homes in Bath and Aix en Provence in the South of France. He has a private jet.

Shams (deity)

Shams, also called or "Shamsum" or "Dhat-Ba' dhanum", is a sun goddess of Arabian mythology. She was the patron goddess of the Himyarite Kingdom. Her name meant shining, Sun, or brilliant. She was the South Arabian equivalent of the North Arabian sun goddess Nuha. 
Prior to Islam, religion on the Arabian Peninsula focused on local gods, with every tribe and kingdom having their particular protective deities. However, there were also gods common for all Arabs, and the trinity of gods representing the Sun, the Moon and the planet Venus seem to have been worshipped throughout Arabia, though their names, gender and worship differed between regions. Thus, Nuha was the name of the sun goddess in Northern Arabia, while the name of the sun goddess in Southern Arabia was Shams. 
As Nuha, Shams was also worshipped in a trinity alongside the male gods of the Moon and Venus. In Saba', the sun goddess Shams was worshipped with the god of the planet Venus, Athtar, and Almaqah, the god of the Moon. In Hadhramaut, Shams was worshipped with Athtar and the moon god Syn. Shams was described as the spouse of Athtar. She was given votive offerings in the shape of horses. 
In Mesopotamia, Athtar was identified with the goddess Ishtar, and Shams with the sun god Shamash.

Bitch (film)

Bitch is a 2017 American dark comedy film written and directed by Marianna Palka.
Plot.
Jill Hart, a stay-at-home mom in the L.A. suburbs, is at breaking point from stress, and from the lengthy work absence of her philandering husband Bill. Alone, she toys with and fails to commit suicide by hanging herself with a dog leash. Her state worsens, in parallel with being troubled by a mysterious dog that visits their garden much of the time, watching the house. Jill suffers a mental breakdown, and vanishes, leaving Bill torn between work and care of their four children. 
Initially fearing she has left or been abducted or harmed, the children find her faeces smeared clothing and phone in the house after school, and later locate Jill in the basement where she has snapped and reverted to behaving like a dog. She snarls and barks at the family as they peer downstairs. 
Out of his depth and trying to maintain the appearance of normality, Bill seeks refuge in focusing on his work needs and minimising his engagement with his wife's condition. He is pressured by Jill's sister Beth to stop shirking and contact the family doctor, but focuses on his work stresses and on keeping the matter secret. He blames his wife for the change to their situation and for selfishly (as he sees it) placing extra work on him to support the family, and blames the doctor for suggesting she needs to be taken into psychiatric hospital care. He begins secretly drinking vodka from the bottle, flushes his wedding ring down the shower drain, neglects work and is fired, and his behaviour disconcerts and pushes away the children. Jill remains in the basement, her behaviour remains feral and aggressive in both bark and snarl. However, gradually Bill and Beth begin to open up to each other and he begins to work with her and support the children as a family, for the good of all. He buys dog toys for Jill, then gently suggests the children stop offering the toys to her, when their attempts to engage increase Jill's stress.
The co-worker whom Bill had been having an affair with, visits Bills house. He sends her away but Beth is furious believing he invited her, and Jill, agitated, escapes, although they find her unharmed by the roadside. Later Beth reveals her family is filing legal papers for custody of her sister, and leaves. At an initial medical meeting, Bill believes the concern is his conduct rather than Jill's best interests, and begins to understand how selfish he had been to her, during their marriage. He sadly accepts medical help and Jill is sedated and removed to a hospital. Living with the children, he does chores, and cleans the basement. His wedding ring is found by a plumber, and he puts it back on. The family move house. His development as a caring parent continues and is reciprocated by the children. The relationship with Beth is healed.
Jill comes home for the first time, the children staying with Beth. She still behaves like a dog but is much calmer. He takes Jill on all 4s to the local dog park to meet other dogs, and plays on all 4s himself to encourage her to play. Later that night, his attempt to help her by offering a shower triggers an aggressive relapse, and then results in Jill traumatically remembering herself. He holds her and talks reassuringly as she uncontrollably sobs. The next morning, in bed, she tentatively gives Bill her first real smile
Release.
The film was released on November 10, 2017.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 39 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Bitch" has an intriguing premise and a strong start that hints at greater things for writer-director-star Marianna Palka, even if its reach ultimately exceeds its grasp." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Christy Lemire of Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 stating the film "has a bark that’s far worse than its bite". John DeFore of "The Hollywood Reporter" said the film was "an unfocused feminist allegory". Jeannette Catsoulis of "The New York Times" said the film was a "satirical scream of rage against patriarchal prerogatives" and "has a vicious edge that can stifle your laughter".

Estella Louise Mann

Estella Louise Mann (November 1, 1871 – August 20, 1947) was an American singer, recording artist, and record executive active in New York in the 1890s. She was one of the first women to make a living as a recording artist, and the first woman to run a record company.
Biography.
Mann was born on November 1, 1871 in Nashville, Tennessee, to Eugene and Maria Mann. She studied vocal performance with Tino Mattioli at the College of Music of Cincinnati in the early 1890s, gaining a certificate in 1893 and a diploma in 1894. She toured briefly as a soloist with Sousa's Band then moved to New York to sing for concerts and opera. At the time, New York was the center of a boom of independent record companies supplying musical records for phonographs and graphophones, which were just beginning to be sold for home listening (rather than phonograph parlors).
In early 1898 she and her singing partner John C. Havens formed the Lyric Phonograph Company. The company showcased records of the Lyric Trio (of Mann, Havens, and bass William F. Hooley) singing opera, comic opera and concert solos, duets and trios. By September of the same year, the company had begun shipping records abroad, had begun recording other artists such as Joseph Weber and Jack Simonds, and had opened a branch office in San Francisco. The company moved to an expanded headquarters in early 1899 and added band, violin, organ, mandolin and other types of records to their catalog throughout the year.
The Lyric Phonograph Co. was still advertising in Phonoscope through May 1900, but Harry Macdonough had replaced Havens as tenor and Grace Spencer had replaced Mann as soprano. The boom of independent phonograph companies had largely bust as Edison and Columbia streamlined and expanded record manufacture and regained control of this aspect of the industry. Mann recorded 13 disc sides for the Berliner and Zonophone companies in 1899 and 1900, then returned to touring, singing opera with Eugenia Mantelli's Grand Opera Company, and singing comic opera and vaudeville.
Mann retired from performance "in her early thirties" (approximately 1905) according to her brother William, whom Jim Walsh interviewed in 1950 for an article in "Favorite Pioneer Recording Artists". She cared for her aging mother in Evansville, Indiana, then died decades later at her brother's house in the same town, though nothing is said about her life in the intervening years.

Adam White (minister)

Adam White (c. 1630 – 19 December 1708) was a Scottish Presbyterian minister imprisoned for non-conformity in Northern Ireland in the 1660s before being pardoned by King Charles II.
Biography.
White was probably born in his family lands of Murthogall (or Murthergill) in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, Scotland about 1630.
White entered the University of Glasgow in the fourth class of 1645 and graduated in 1648 with a Master of Arts degree. He is shown as ministering at Laggan Presbyterian Church in [[Fannet]], Donegal, Ireland in 1654. From 1655 - 1661, [[Oliver Cromwell]]’s government endowed White with £80 per year for support. He was jailed by [[Robert Leslie (bishop)|Robert Leslie]] the [[Bishop of Raphoe]] in 1664 in [[Lifford]] for non-conformity to the Church of Ireland. In 1670, Charles II issued him a pardon upon hearing that he had "formerly suffered for his cause.” He returned to [[Fannet]] before taking up ministering again at [[Ardstraw]], Tyrone, Ireland in 1672. In 1688 he fled to Scotland, perhaps due to events related to the [[Glorious Revolution]]. In 1692, he returned to Northern Ireland and became minister at Dunluce Church in [[Bushmills]]. He remained until his death on 19 December 1708 and was buried in the churchyard.
Excommunication, Imprisonment, and Appeal to Charles II.
In 1664, White and three other ministers, John Hart of Monreagh, William Semple of Letterkenny, and Thomas Drummond of Ramelton, were summoned to appear before the Bishop of Raphoe's court to answer for their non-conformity. When they failed to appear, Bishop Leslie passed a sentence of excommunication against them and issued a [[Writ De Excommunicato Capiendo Act 1562]]. They were apprehended and imprisoned in Lifford gaol without bail. After a time the sheriff allowed them to move to a house in the town of Lifford where they were able to have guests, but they were still deprived of their freedom. They took various steps to secure their release, first contacting [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory]] who was the Deputy of Ireland and the son of the [[Duke of Ormond]]. When this failed, they procured a habeas corpus to have their matter decided at the King's Bench, but found no relief. They requested to be heard by the Court of the Chancery, however, the [[Archbishop of Dublin]] ordered their re-imprisonment in the gaol at Lifford. Finally, they sent a petition to Charles II who upon hearing that they had previously suffered for his cause and that their only crime was not appearing before the [[Bishop of Raphoe]], wrote to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in October 1670 and ordered their immediate release.
Children.
Though the name of his wife is not known, Adam White is believed to have had at least three sons: George, Hugh, and Moses. George received a grant of land from his father in 1699 and is believed to have stayed in Scotland. Hugh was a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] and took part in the [[Rising of 1715]]. He was captured at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)|Battle of Preston]] in Lancashire, England and transported to the American Colonies in 1716 as punishment for treason and levying war on the king. Moses went to America in 1722 with the wives and children of both brothers to reunite the families in Pennsylvania.
Descendants.
Though he never came to the New World, White is the ancestor of several prominent United States politicians and leaders. Some of these include:
[[Hugh Lawson White]], U.S. Senator; General [[James White (general)|James White]], founder of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]; [[Edward Douglass White Jr.]], United States Senator and the ninth Chief Justice of the United States; [[Edward Douglass White Sr.]], Governor of [[Louisiana]]; [[Stephen Decatur Miller]], Governor of [[South Carolina]]; and [[Joseph Lanier Williams]], United States Congressman from [[Tennessee]]. He is also ancestor to [[Tennessee Williams]] and David White and William White founders of the [[White Furniture Company]].

<doc id="56847754" url="?curid=56847754" title="Paramontroseite">
Paramontroseite

Paramontroseite (V4+O2) is a relatively rare orthorhombic vanadium oxide mineral in the Ramsdellite group. Synthetic paramontroseite may have applications in medicine, batteries and electronics.
Name.
The name Paramontroseite is derived from the Greek "παρα" (para), meaning near, and montroseite, a related mineral.
The name was chosen due to the mineral's paramorphic relationship to the host mineral montroseite.
Montroseite is named after Montrose County, Colorado, USA, where it was first found.
Names in other languages include Paramontroseit (German), Paramontroseita (Spanish), Парамонтрозеит (Russian) and 副黑钒矿 副黑铁钒矿 (Chinese).
Synonyms are Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) 22303 and Powder Diffraction File (PDF) 25-1003.
Occurrence.
Paramontroseite is associated with montroseite and corvusite.
It is found in relatively unoxidized Colorado Plateau-type uranium–vanadium ores in sandstones.
The type locality is Bitter Creek Mine, Paradox Valley, Uravan District, Montrose County, Colorado, USA.
In the USA it is found in Montrose County, Colorado, San Miguel County, Colorado, Mesa County, Colorado, Emery County, Utah, Apache County, Arizona, McKinley County, New Mexico and Fall River County, South Dakota.
It has also been reported from locations in the Czech Republic, Mendoza Province, Argentina and the Mounana uranium mine near Franceville, Gabon.
Paramontrosite has also been found in an outcrop on the Van Irvine Ranch in the Pumpkin Buttes area of Wyoming, USA, associated with sulfides in red sandstone.
It is found in a zone where the sandstone changes color from red to gray.
The black paramontroseite cements grains of sand into nodular masses that enclose smaller pyrite masses.
The irregular concretionary masses are up to across.
Vanadium salts have given a greenish coating to the exposed surfaces of these masses.
The masses are anomalously radioactive and the surrounding sandstone is weakly radioactive.
The radioactivity is mostly caused by tiny specks of coffinite in the paramontroseite.
When a section is polished the paramontroseite completely fills the gaps between the grains of sand.
It is very soft and has a gray color that is slightly lighter than quartz gray.
There is strong anisotrophism and many bright multi-colored internal reflections.
Deposits of montroseite (V,Fe)OOH and paramontroseite VO2 have been found in the Saltwash Sandstone Member of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation in the Colorado Plateau.
From the diffraction characteristics of the paramontroseite there seem to be two distinct generations: a primary paramontroseite with good crystalline structure and a product of montroseite oxidation with poor crystalline structure.
The paramontroseite found in this region is among the neutral minerals in the mid-range of vanadium valence (+4) above the primary ore of montroseite (+3) but below minerals such as carnotite (+5) and pascoite (+5).
Lifecycle.
Paramontroseite is a metastable form of vanadium dioxide (VO2) that results from oxidation of montroseite.
It is formed by dehydrogenation of montroseite.
Paramontroseite seems to be the most common initial product of oxidation of montroseite.
The primary difference between the crystal structures of the two minerals is that the oxygen–oxygen distance increases from 2.63Å in montroseite to 3.87Å in paramontroseite due to the loss of hydrogen in the latter.
The vanadium–oxygen distances are also somewhat shorter in paramontroseite than in montroseite, as would be expected when the vanadium is oxidized from +3 to +4 when the hydrogen is removed.
The montroseite, VO(OH), is deposited in crystalline masses in a sandstone matrix by some unknown process.
Usually iron occurs in place of some of the vanadium.
Oxygen in the air or groundwater then oxidizes the crystallised montroseite at temperatures under 50 °C through the reaction:
During the solid state alteration process the hydrogen atoms migrate through the crystal structure to the surface, where they combine with oxygen.
In the process there is a slight shift in the crystal structure, but the structure remains intact.
The vanadium-oxygen bonds have not been broken and the hexagonal close-packed oxygen framework has not been disrupted.
In some cases there may be an intermediate "diffuse A" phase.
The process by which montroseite is altered to paramontroseite seems analogous to the magnetite → maghemite, lepidocrocite → maghemite, and goethite → hematite processes.
Paramontroseite is not stable and is destroyed by weathering, replaced by minerals of the corvusite type.
The paramontroseite reacts under neutral or acid conditions to form many compounds such as vanadyl vanadate and metal vanadates such as hewettite, hummerite, pascoite and rossite.
Paramontroseite may dissolve in slightly alkaline conditions, then combine with Ca++ to form simplotite:
Possible applications.
Autophagy is a process of cellular degradation that is essential in preserving homeostasis of cells.
It is often thought that when autophagosomes encapsulate and trap inorganic nanoparticles they may be unable to degrade them and the cell's well-being may be threatened.
However, experiments have shown that nanocrystals of paramontroseite induce cyto-protective autophagy in cultured HeLa cells.
It is possible that this may have value in therapies.
Montroseite and paramontroseite microspheres have been synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization of sucrose and calcinated to form V2O3-VO2-C core-shell microspheres.
These have been used experimentally as cathode materials for a lithium-ion battery.
Y. Xu and colleagues of the University of Science and Technology of China have shown that synthetic montroseite VOOH hollow structures can convert topochemically to paramontroseite without altering the size and appearance of the structures.
Both forms appears to have potential in lithium ion batteries as anode materials.
Monoclinic vanadium dioxide VO2(M) is potentially of great value for applications such as intelligent temperature sensors and smart windows.
The classic solid state transformation from vanadium precursors to rutile VO2(R) is slow and costly.
A transformation from goethite VOOH to synthetic "paramontroseite" VO2 to the desired monoclinic VO2(M) promises to greatly reduce cost and time.
Classification.
Paramontroseite was first described before 1959.
It is a member of the Ramsdellite Group.

Flor (band)

Flor (stylized as flor) (previously Sunderland) is an American indie band formed in Hood River, Oregon in 2014. The band currently consists of Zach Grace (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), McKinley Kitts (guitar), Dylan Bauld (bass), and Kyle Hill (drums).
History.
The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Zach Grace began experimenting with electronic music-making programs to create ear-catching synth sounds. Bauld built tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that updated the sound of the '80s for the 21st century. After moving to Los Angeles, Flor connected with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who helped the band come up with distinctive visuals. Meanwhile, Bauld established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like Halsey, Lights, Smallpools, and Lostboycrow. The band released their debut single, "heart", online in 2014, with the "Sounds" EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length "Sights &amp; Sounds", Flor signed to Fueled by Ramen in 2016, which reissued the "Sounds" EP that February.
Flor's debut album, "come out. you’re hiding" was released on May 19, 2017. The album title was teased in a tweet on March 23 before being confirmed in another tweet the next day. The album’s lead single, "guarded", was released the same day. Following this, the band released the official tracklist through two tweets.
On March 8, 2019, Flor released the new single "slow motion". On July 10 they announced their second studio album, "ley lines". It came out on September 6, 2019 and includes twelve songs. When asked about the inspiration behind the album, lead singer Grace said, "There's a theory that important places of power like Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Giza are connected by invisible lines. As a parallel, I needed to find my own anchor points for belief and purpose. I realized you can build those roads yourself. Friends, family, and the band are my anchors. The music comes out of the 'ley lines'".
On November 11, 2019, Flor announced their first North American tour.

Fragmentation (medicine)

In medicine, fragmentation is an operation that breaks of solid matter in a body part into pieces. Physical force (e.g., manual force, ultrasonic force), applied directly or indirectly through intervening body parts, are used to break down the solid matter into pieces. The solid matter may be an abnormal by-product of a biological function, or a foreign body. The pieces of solid matter are not taken out, but are eliminated or absorbed through normal biological functions. Examples would be the fragmentation of kidney and urinary bladder stones (nephrolithiasis and urolithiasis, respectively) by shock-wave lithotripsy, laser lithotripsy, or transurethral lithotripsy.
The code for fragmentation in ICD-10-PCS is 0FF.

Roger Dale Martin

Roger Dale Martin, or more commonly known as Roger Dale, is a heavy metal musician who has performed with several acts including Vengeance Rising and Once Dead.
History.
Roger Dale Martin was born on June 19, in Oklahoma. At the age of 12 he was playing in bands, as he did throughout and even after his High School years. He worked for a construction company, which traveled to several different states, where he would form new bands. One job took him to California, where he met David Enos and joined the band Emerald. He recorded on the band's debut EP, "Armed for Battle", and following its completion, moved on from the band. After finishing his stint with Emerald, he played a few shows with Holy Right before leaving that band.
Martin then went on to play for Sanctuary Church's band – Sanctuary Celebration Band – for a brief time in 1986. Afterward, Martin was introduced to Doug Thieme, who started Sacrifice with Martin. The two brought in Thieme's friend Larry Farkas, who was in Deliverance. The three then began searching for a drummer and vocalist to play for the band. Originally, the three found Steve Bertram on Drums and Sharon on Vocals. Bertram left the band, and was replaced by Mike Betts of Neon Cross. However, Sharon and Betts both departed. The group then found Glen Mancaruso, who agreed to play for the band temporarily until they could find a more permanent drummer, and Glenn Rogers on guitars. The group wrote some material and were introduced to Vocalist Roger Martinez by Pastor Bob Beeman. Rogers left the band, but after writing a majority of the songs. With the lineup of Martin, Thieme, Farkas, Mancaruso and Martinez, the band now known as Vengeance Rising began recording their debut album, "Human Sacrifice".
The band toured around and signed to Medusa Records, which then got bought out by the Christian label, Intense Records, a subsidiary of Frontline Records. The band played several shows and got secular distribution and became respected by many metal bands. In 1990, the band recorded and released "Once Dead". While supporting the album on the Once Dead Tour, the band members, including Martin, felt a disconnect with Martinez. After the tour finished, the four signed over all debts to Martinez, which he agreed to. The ordeal was documented in "Heaven's Metal Magazine". Much drama followed after this, with Martinez blaming the members of the band as stealing from him and abandoning him with all the debt.
Martin then joined Triple Ace, a ministry based biker band, which was a part of Bikers for Christ. Several months later, the four formed a project called Die Happy with former Joshua vocalist Robin Basuri and recorded a self-titled album, which was released in 1992. Martin departed from Die Happy in 1993, as he was moving to Nashville and started a ministry band called Pond Scum. Not much else was heard from Martin musically until 2004, when the four members of Vengeance attempted to do a reunion show with the band and Scott Waters of Ultimatum on vocals. The group were sued by Martinez, claiming he owned the rights to the name.
Since the band could not play as Vengeance, they formed under the name of Once Dead and released a DVD titled "Return With a Vengeance." However, by 2006, a three members of the band - Mancaruso, Waters and Martin - departed from the band.
In August 2017, it was announced that Vengeance Rising would be reuniting for So Cal Metal Fest in honor of Dale Huffman, a radio show host of Metal Pulse Radio and writer at Untombed Zine. The band also re-released "Human Sacrifice" on vinyl for the 30th Anniversary of the album. Martin also had personal hand written notes within the 30 year pressing on the album. The band performed at the Festival with the original lineup, with Jim Settle (ex-Tantrum of the Muse, Hand of Fire) on vocals. The band, as this incarnation, are currently working on new material and have gained a record deal in the process. Later, it was announced, that the band would be going under the name of Once Dead, reviving their old project with Jim Settle and Roger Sampson (ex-Precious Death) on Vocals and Drums respectively. In 2019, it was announced that Emerald would reunite, with Martin being a part of the lineup once more.

Roger Dale Martin is an outspoken Christian. He has been described by reviews as having a fun presence and as a fantastic bass player.

Tachikawa R-38

The Tachikawa R-38 was a Japanese training aircraft of the late 1930s. It was a single-engined parasol monoplane that was intended for use by civil training schools. Two examples were built, with the Japanese Military's control of resources preventing any further production.
Design and development.
In 1938, the Tachikawa Aircraft Company, which was building large numbers of its Ki-9 and Ki-17 basic and primary trainers for the Imperial Japanese Army, began work on a new training aircraft for use by civilian training schools. The aircraft, the Tachikawa R-38, was a single-engined parasol wing monoplane. It had a fabric-covered welded steel tube fuselage and a wood and metal wing. The student and instructor sat in separate tandem open cockpits.
The first prototype was powered by a Gasuden Jimpu seven-cylinder radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller and made its first flight on 22 February 1939. The aircraft was tested by the Japanese Army, with the conclusion that the lighter R-38 was superior to the Army's Ki-17 primary trainer, which used the same engine. As the Ki-17 was already in production, however, the Army had no need for a new trainer. A second prototype, the R-38-Kai was built powered by an experimental Kosoku KO-4 four-cylinder air-cooled inline engine, produced by a subsidiary of Tachikawa. The R-38-Kai flew in July 1941.
No production of the R-38 or the R-38-Kai followed. From 1938, all major Japanese aircraft companies were required to be licensed by the government, with the armed services controlling the management of the companies. As there was no military requirement for the R-38, the Japanese Army prevented any further production.

Diesel Air Dair 100

The Diesel Air Dair 100 is an opposed-piston diesel aircraft engine, designed and produced by Diesel Air Ltd of Olney, Buckinghamshire for use in airships, home-built kitplanes and light aircraft. The prototype was built in the 1990s and exhibited it at PFA (now LAA) airshows. Although Diesel Air engines have been fitted to an AT-10 airship and to a Luscombe 8A monoplane, production numbers have been very limited.
Design and development.
The Dair 100 engine is a twin-cylinder two-stroke, opposed-piston, displacement, liquid-cooled, diesel engine direct drive design. It produces at 2500 rpm, with a compression ratio of 18:1. The engine has two cylinders and two crankshafts linked to four pistons, the combustion chamber formed between the crowns of the pistons. There are no poppet valves, each cylinder having a ring of ports at each end. In this "one-direction (uniflow)" engine these ports, respectively, admit air and expel exhaust gases. This design eliminates the need for a cylinder head and camshafts. Scavenging is assisted by a centrifugal air pump, the pump also serving to provide a mild supercharging effect. Fitment of an exhaust-driven turbocharger is permissible.
The engine may use either diesel fuel (DERV) or Jet-A1 kerosene (AVTUR). Jet-A1 is more readily available at airfields, but its reduced lubricity (compared to diesel fuel) could mean that additional cylinder lubrication may be required. Fuel is directly injected into each cylinder, pressure being supplied by a hydraulically-governed mechanical fuel pump.
Dry sump lubrication is by high pressure pump delivering oil to plain main bearings and con-rod bearings.

SS Margaret Olwill

SS "Margaret Olwill" was a shipping vessel originally constructed in 1887 to transport goods on Lake Erie. It was rebuilt twice to new specifications. It was wrecked in 1899 in an unexpected June storm with the loss of at least eight lives.
Vehicle description.
"Margaret Olwill" was a steam-powered bulk carrier steam barge built of wood. It was 175.6 feet in length and had a breadth of 34 feet. The US registry number was US 91953. It was equipped with a steeple compound engine built by the Cuyahoga Iron Works of Cleveland. It had a gross registered tonnage of 554 tons. The vessel was specifically designed with capabilities to load and unload within a matter of hours. The vessel was built with economy in mind, ignoring artistic sensitivity.
History.
"Margaret Olwill" was constructed in 1887 by Henry D. Root of Cleveland, Ohio for L. P. Smith and J. A. Smith of Cleveland. The ship was named for the maiden name of the first wife of L. P. and J. A.'s father, Pat Smith who was the founder of the family business. It was built in the Smith brothers' yard in the old river bed of the Cuyahoga River. Her captain for the 1888 season was William H. Johnson. In 1890 "Margaret Olwill" was overhauled to run with a propeller. In 1892 her captain was P. J. Carr. It was re-purposed yet again in 1893 to be a steam barge. John Brown of St. Clair, Michigan, was assigned "Margaret Olwill"'s captain in 1894 at the age of 39. That year the Smiths signed an eight year contract to haul limestone quarried from Kelleys Island, Ohio to a project extending the west arm of Cleveland harbor's breakwater. The assigned crew largely drew from the circle of John Brown's friends and family. William Doyle, the fireman, was the brother of Brown's wife. George Heffron, the wheelsman, was a cousin of Mrs. Brown. Engineers Luke Cynski and Patrick Murphy were long-time family friends of the Browns.
Shipwreck.
"Margaret Olwill"'s last voyage took place June 28, 1899, in which it was carrying limestone weighing 900 tons. Among the 12 or 13 individuals on board the ship were Captain Brown's wife and young son Blanchard. A close personal friend of Mrs. Brown's, Cora Hitchcock Hunt, had been invited aboard for what had been invariably a routine excursion. Also invited was Captain Brown's parents, but his father declined after viewing the vessel. Missing this particular voyage was chief engineer Murphy, who had just been reassigned to another vessel owned by the Smiths over the protestations of both Brown and Murphy. With the hatch filled to the coaming, the ship could haul 300 tons. For this voyage an additional 600 tons were placed on the deck. Although weather conditions were unfavorable and deteriorating, Captain Brown set course for Cleveland right at midnight. Soon after departure conditions included winds of 50 miles an hour. Seams opened in the ship's hull, and "Margaret Olwill" took on water, which mixed with the limestone causing a significant list. Brown attempted to pilot the ship to shelter in Lorain, Ohio, but the steering chains failed at about 4:30 am, and the ship became broadside to the waves. With the knowledge that the ship was certain to be wrecked, Brown ordered those aboard into lifeboats. Before his order could be carried out, a rogue wave swept over "Margaret Olwill" and capsized the ship, which soon sank at approximately 6 am. Before he was tossed overboard, Luke Schinski had the presence of mind to grab a piece of canvas for assistance in rescue.
Four of the crew were rescued by the steamer "State of Ohio" and the steamer "Sacramento", who found the men clinging to the boat's wreckage. Smith, McLea, and Schinski had spotted the "State of Ohio" after several hours in the water, but the ship did not observe their wavings and hollerings, which greatly discouraged the men. However, the "State of Ohio" later found George Heffron and Duncan Coyle alive, clinging to a piece of the deckhouse amongst a large field of wreckage. The storm was still fierce, but ropes were thrown within reaching distance of both men. Coyle was able to tie the rope around his waist, but Heffron was too exhausted to grab onto the rope that was thrown to him, and slipped underwater as the "State of Ohio"'s crew and passengers watched helplessly. The other group of three men renewed their frantic shoutings as they observed this rescue, but they remained yet undetected. Utterly discouraged, their hope was renewed when another ship was spotted by Schinski. This time they made the decision to coordinate their shouts, with the idea the sound would carry further. This was successful, as the "Sacramento" gave a whistle and turned around to rescue the sailors. The "Sacramento" was a much larger vessel, and had considerable difficulty maneuvering with sufficient accuracy to rescue the men. Another vessel, the "Cascade", noticed the unusual movements of the "Sacramento" and supposed the "Sacramento" to be encountering difficulty. Drawing alongside, the "Cascade" was able to pick up the two men that the "Sacramento" had been unable to reach.
Eight people died in the accident, including Captain Brown, his wife, and son. The bodies of the deceased washed ashore east of Vermilion, Ohio. Much of the ship's wreckage beached at Cedar Point, Ohio and was sighted by John Brown's brother George Brown, who was captaining the steamer "Arrow".
Captain Brown had a reputation for following orders, thus historian Mark Thompson posits that Brown was obeying the ship's owners when he commenced the voyage, with the ship overloaded and weather adverse. A contemporaneous insurance review supposed that Captain Brown, with long experience on Lake Erie, would not believe a small storm would become a major gale in June.
Discovery of shipwreck.
A diver named Rob Ruetschle had spent twenty-nine years searching for the remains of "Margaret Olwill", searching an area covering more than sixty square miles. Ruetschle believed he had discovered the wreck in 1989, but further investigation revealed the "wreck" to be a rockpile. Ruetschle discovered the wreck July 26, 2017, in conjunction with the Cleveland Underwater Explorers dive team and the National Museum of the Great Lakes. It was identified by the ship's steam engine and the location thereof.

Tsamma juice ( ) is a brand of watermelon juice, produced by Frey Farms since 2014. The juice is also available ready-mixed with coconut water or blueberry juice.
The brand is named after Tsamma, a local name for a type of watermelon found in sub-Saharan Africa, said to be "the Mother of all watermelon varieties"; however, the juice is farmed from watermelons grown in the Midwest and Southern United States. The production farms cover a total of of watermelons, and also house a major national supplier of pumpkins.
History.
The juice was first produced by company founder Sarah Frey, aged 16, following a traditional family recipe. She established a full-time business after graduating from high school, realizing there was no commercial distributor of watermelon juice, and was shipping to 150 stores by the end of the first year of production. Frey has suggested that the juice could be a suitable replacement for coconut water.

Lucien Haudebert

Lucien Haudebert (10 April 1877 – 24 February 1963) was a French composer who strongly identified with his Breton heritage.
Life.
Haudebert was born in Fougères, Département Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany. He received his first music lessons at age 5 from the local organist at the Catholic church of Saint Léonard and was able to play his first Bach prelude at age 7. He studied philosophy at a college in Laval and subsequently received a degree in business studies (Diplôme des Hautes Études Commerciales), following his father's wishes. He spent his military service at Vitré until September 1900.
Musically largely self-taught, against his parents' wishes he then went to Paris where he made the acquaintance of Gabriel Fauré, then organist at the Eglise de la Madeleine, and received private lessons from him, cut short by his suffering from anemia. Roman Catholic himself, he married his Protestant wife Mary (1879–1958) in Paris in 1907, a poet who often provided the words for Haudebert's songs and choral pieces. He participated in World War I, leaving the army as lieutenant.
He spent his life mainly in Paris where he died.
Music.
The strength of Haudebert's music lay in his melodic inventiveness and his music's "singability". Although he created a large oeuvre of orchestral and chamber music, his vocal and choral music are regarded as his main achievement. His greatest success was the oratorio "Dieu vainqueur" for vocal soloists, mixed chorus, organ and orchestra, given with 600 participants in December 1927 at Mannheim, Germany.
Harmonically conservative, he wrote in a late Romantic style, often coloured by Breton folk music, particularly in his instrumental music. He was a member of the short-lived Association des Compositeurs Bretons and often participated in Breton cultural events in Paris.
He was awarded the Prix Paul Dukas in 1945. He was a personal friend of a number of other Breton composers as well as of composers Ernest Bloch and Swan Hennessy and the writer Romain Rolland.

Pan European Networks

Pan European Networks (PEN) is a marketing company. They try to convince people that "publishing" with them is a way to reach European science leadership. This however appears to be untrue and it is regarded as a non-credible source. They started in 2012 and have offices in the United Kingdom and Brussels.
Operations.
The organization is known for making calls to researchers offering to publish their work but requesting an immediate commitment. Initial proposed charges are around 10,000 USD for a publication but this appears to be negotiable. Their persistence has been described as harassment by Uppsala University. They have also threatened to sue those who criticize them. They published a magazine called Scitech Europa Quarterly and Health Europa Quarterly among others.

ROH 2nd Anniversary Show

ROH 2nd Anniversary Show was the second ROH Anniversary Show professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH). It took place on February 14, 2004 at the National Guard Armory in Braintree, Massachusetts.
The show featured a tournament to crown the inaugural Pure Wrestling Champion, with A.J. Styles defeating CM Punk in the tournament final to become the first Pure Wrestling Champion. Apart from the tournament, Samoa Joe retained the ROH World Championship against BJ Whitmer, Dan Maff and Low Ki in a Four Corner Survival match, The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) retained the ROH Tag Team Championship against The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid) and Special K (Dixie, Hydro and Izzy) defeated The Carnage Crew (DeVito, Justin Credible and Loc) in a Country Whipping match.
Storylines.
The event largely revolved around the new Pure Wrestling Championship which was introduced in late 2003 as the successor to the Field of Honor Tournament which culminated at Final Battle won by Matt Stryker. The title featured the pure wrestling rules which included total three rope breaks in a match, closed-fist punches to the face were prohibited and the referee would count to 20 instead of 10 if a wrestler went outside the ring. The first pure wrestling match in ROH took place at "The Battle Lines Are Drawn", where Stryker defeated Alex Shelley. At "The Last Stand", John Walters defeated Chad Collyer in a pure wrestling match to qualify for the Pure Wrestling Tournament.
At "The Last Stand", Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer defeated Matt Stryker and Xavier in a Four Corner Survival match to win the ROH World Championship #1 Contender's Trophy, thus setting up a three-way match against Samoa Joe for the World Championship at 2nd Anniversary Show.
At "Wrestlerave '03" on June 28, 2003, The Carnage Crew (DeVito, Justin Credible and Loc) defeated Special K (Deranged, Dixie and Izzy) in a six-man tag team match, beginning a lengthy feud between the two teams. The two teams traded wins in a series of matches throughout the year, setting up a Country Whipping match between the two teams at 2nd Anniversary Show.
Event.
Quarterfinals.
The event kicked off with the quarterfinals of a tournament for the new Pure Wrestling Championship. John Walters faced CM Punk in the first match. Walters delivered a "Hurricane DDT" to Punk and covered him for the pinfall but Punk put his foot on the rope. Walter then rolled up Punk, who reversed it to pin Walter for the win.
Next, Chris Sabin faced Doug Williams in the second quarter-final match. Sabin managed to hit a "Cradle Shock" on Williams but got a near-fall and then Williams delivered a "Chaos Theory" to Sabin's injured neck for the win.
Next, Matt Stryker defeated Josh Daniels by making him submit to the "Stryker Lock" for the win.
The last quarter-final match featured A.J. Styles competing against Jimmy Rave. Styles injured his knee while executing a "Stylin' DDT". Rave dropkicked Styles in the knee and hit a dragon screw legwhip. Rave then ran to attack Styles but Styles hit a discus clothesline for the win.
Next, Special K (Dixie, Hydro and Izzy) took on The Carnage Crew (DeVito, Justin Credible and Loc) in a Country Whipping match. Credible delivered a "That's Incredible" to Izzy and then Angel Dust brought out DeVito's daughter to distract him, which led to DeVito and Credible rushing to the backstage to save her leaving Loc alone against Special K. Loc was then hit with a spike piledriver on a table outside the ring and Izzy pinned him for the win.
Semifinals.
The semi-final round of the Pure Wrestling Championship tournament started as Doug Williams took on CM Punk. Williams was tied into the corner in a tree of woe by Punk, who hit a shoulder block in Williams' knee and proceeded to hit another but Williams reversed it into "Chaos Theory" but his shoulder were also down on the mat and Punk put his shoulder up on the two-count for the win.
In the next semi-final match, A.J. Styles took on Matt Stryker. Styles delivered a "Superman" to Stryker to advance to the final round.
Next, The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) defended the ROH Tag Team Championship against The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid). Mark knocked out Acid with a tornado DDT from the top rope onto a table outside the ring. Briscoes hit a "Spike Jay-Driller" to Kashmere to retain the titles.
In the penultimate match, Samoa Joe defended the ROH World Championship against BJ Whitmer, Dan Maff and Low Ki. Maff and Ki fell out of the ring when Maff hit a spear to Ki and Joe applied a "Coquina Clutch" on Whitmer to retain the title.
Final.
A.J. Styles faced CM Punk in the Pure Wrestling Championship tournament final. Punk attempted to execute a "Pepsi Plunge" on Styles but Styles countered with a backflip kick and delivered a "Styles Clash" to Punk from the top rope to win the tournament and become the inaugural Pure Wrestling Champion.
Aftermath.
AJ Styles defended the Pure Wrestling Championship against CM Punk in the main event of ROH's next show "At Our Best" with Ricky Steamboat serving as the special guest referee. Styles retained the title. However, it would mark Styles' last appearance in ROH for one year as Styles' home promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling severed its ties with ROH due to the Rob Feinstein controversy and barred its contracted wrestlers from appearing in ROH. This resulted in Styles vacating the Pure Wrestling Championship on April 24 and a tournament was set up to determine the new champion at "Reborn: Completion" on July 17.
The feud continued between Special K and Carnage Crew as the two teams competed in a Scramble match at "At Our Best", which Carnage Crew won to end the rivalry.

ROH One Year Anniversary Show

ROH One Year Anniversary Show was the first ROH Anniversary Show professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH). It took place on February 8, 2003 at the Elks Lodge in Queens, New York.
Event.
Preliminary matches.
The first match was a Four Corner Survival match between EZ Money, Chad Collyer, Colt Cabana and Michael Shane. Collyer had applied a Texas Cloverleaf to Shane but Shane made it to the ropes and Money entered the ring and delivered a "Cha-Ching" to Collyer for the win.
Next, Texas Wrestling Academy students Don Juan, Fast Eddie and Hotstuff Hernandez took on The Carnage Crew members DeVito, HC Loc and Masada. Fast Eddie attempted to hit a springboard moonsault to HC Loc but Loc hit him with a hubcap in the mid-air, resulting in Carnage Crew getting disqualified. They continued to attack their opponents after the match until Christopher Street Connection made the save.
Next, Jay Briscoe took on Mark Briscoe. Jay delivered three consecutive "Jay-Drillers"" to Mark for the win.
Next, Homicide took on Steve Corino, who brought out Simply Luscious, Samoa Joe, C.W. Anderson and Michael Shane as members of his Group. Homicide attacked Corino with the microphone to start the match. Near the end of the match, Corino delivered an "Old School Expulsion" to gain a near-fall and then applied a cobra clutch on Homicide but he made it to the ropes so Corino dragged him in the middle of the ring to apply the cobra clutch and win by submission. After the match, Corino continued to choke Homicide, leading to the crowd jumping the rail to brawl in the ring.
Later, a match was about to begin between The Ring Crew Express (Kevin Dunn and Kirby Marcos) and The Outcast Killaz but Gary Michael Cappetta interrupted them before the match even began and brought out C.W. Anderson, who attacked both teams and issued an open challenge for a match which was answered by CM Punk. Anderson was about to hit an "Anderson Spinebuster" but Punk rolled through with a sunset flip and pinned Anderson for the win.
Next, Bryan Danielson took on Samoa Joe. Joe apparently knocked out Danielson with knee strikes in the head and nailed a powerbomb but as he went to pick up him, Danielson pinned him with a small package for the win.
The following match was a three-way between A.J. Styles, Low Ki and Paul London for a future ROH Championship opportunity. Ki nailed a "Ki Krusher" to Styles from the top rope, which put both men down on the mat, so London hit a shooting star press on Styles for the win. ROH Champion Xavier challenged London immediately after the match. London nailed a shooting star press on Xavier and covered him for the pinfall but Allison Danger pulled Xavier out of the ring right before the three count. Danger entered the ring but Alexis Laree speared her. The match continued between Xavier and London as Xavier ended up pinning London with a roll-up to retain the title.
Main event match.
The team of Da Hit Squad (Mafia and Monsta Mack), Divine Storm (Chris Divine and Quiet Storm), The S.A.T. (Jose and Joel Maximo) and Mikey Whipwreck competed against Special K (Angel Dust, Brian XL, Deranged, Dixie, Hydro, Izzy, Jody Fleisch, Slim J, Slugger and Yeyo) in a Handicap Scramble match. Whipwreck turned on his team mid-way into the match by hitting "Whippersnappers" on his teammates and joined Special K. Trinity confronted Whipwreck on it and Slugger hit her with a bodybag and then Whipwreck and Slugger took her to the backstage. The action continued between the two teams. Mafia delivered a "Burning Hammer" to Deranged from the top rope for the win.
Reception.
J.D. Dunn of "411Mania" rated the event a score of 7 out of 10, writing "This is another one of those cases of too much of a good thing. At nearly 4 hours, it could use a good trimming. The riot took up nearly half an hour with all the replays. But, otherwise, it was four hours of solid wrestling and angle development."
Derek Burgan of "Pro Wrestling Torch" wrote "ROH's First Year Anniversary Show is definitely going down in the top 10 ROH shows of All Time. The fan riot was quite the spectacle and both matches with Paul London were incredible."

ROH Third Anniversary Celebration

Third Anniversary Celebration was the third Anniversary Show professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH). It was a three-day event which took place on February 19, 25 and 26, 2005 at different venues.
The February 19 show took place at Rex Plex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The event was headlined by a Scramble match in which The Ring Crew Express (Dunn and Marcos) defeated Azrieal and Dixie, Generation Next (Jack Evans and Roderick Strong), Special K (Deranged and Izzy) and The Carnage Crew (DeVito and Loc). In other prominent matches on the card, Austin Aries defeated Colt Cabana in a steel cage match to retain the ROH World Championship, B.J. Whitmer and Dan Maff defeated The Havana Pitbulls (Ricky Reyes and Rocky Romero) to win the ROH Tag Team Championship, John Walters retained the ROH Pure Championship against Jay Lethal and Homicide defeated Bryan Danielson in a Taped Fist match, the second match of the Match 2 of the Best of Five Series between the two.
The February 25 show took place at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds in Dayton, Ohio. The event marked the return of A.J. Styles to ROH for the first time in over a year who last appeared for the promotion at "At Our Best" on March 13, 2004. He headlined the event against Jimmy Rave in a losing effort. In other prominent matches at the event, Bryan Danielson and Samoa Joe defeated Generation Next (Austin Aries and Jack Evans) in a tag team match and B.J. Whitmer and Dan Maff retained the ROH Tag Team Championship against Delirious and Jimmy Jacobs. The event also featured the ROH debut of James Gibson against Spanky.
The February 26 show emanated from the Frontier Fieldhouse in Chicago Ridge, Illinois. In the main event, Austin Aries retained the ROH World Championship against Samoa Joe. The undercard notably featured the third match in the Best of Five Series between Homicide and Bryan Danielson, a Falls Count Anywhere match which Danielson won. Also at the event, Jimmy Rave defeated CM Punk and the team of Colt Cabana and Nigel McGuinness defeated B.J. Whitmer and Dan Maff in a non-title tag team match.
Storylines.
Main event matches.
At the second night of "Death Before Dishonor II" on July 24, 2004, The Second City Saints (Ace Steel and CM Punk) defeated BJ Whitmer and Dan Maff in an Unsanctioned Chicago Street Fight. After the match, Generation Next attacked the Saints. At "Scramble Cage Melee", Steel defeated Generation Next member Roderick Strong but was attacked by Generation Next after the match which led to Second City Saints member Colt Cabana making the save and setting up an impromptu match against Generation Next's Austin Aries. Aries injured Cabana by brutalizing him and making him pass out by injuring his arm in a post-match assault. Cabana returned to ROH at "All Star Extravaganza 2" where he teamed with Jimmy Jacobs to rescue Bobby Heenan from Generation Next. After Aries won the ROH World Championship at Final Battle, Cabana challenged him for the title at "It All Begins" which Aries retained. After the match, Cabana challenged Aries to a steel cage match for the title at Third Anniversary Celebration.
At Final Battle, it was announced that AJ Styles would make his return to ROH at the Third Anniversary Celebration after a nearly one-year hiatus having last appeared at "At Our Best" on March 13, 2004. His opponent was announced to be Jimmy Rave.
At Final Battle, Austin Aries defeated Samoa Joe to win the ROH World Championship. It was later announced that Joe would receive his rematch for the title against Aries at night three of Third Anniversary Celebration.
Undercard matches.
The feud between Bryan Danielson and Homicide dated back to "Reborn: Stage Two" on April 24, 2004 where Homicide cheated to defeat Danielson. A rematch took place between the two at "All Star Extravaganza 2" which Danielson won but Danielson was attacked by Homicide's group The Rottweilers who went too far by attempting to rip off Danielson's eye. At Final Battle, it was announced that a Match 2 of the Best of Five Series would take place between the two. Later that night, Homicide interfered in Danielson's match with Rottweilers stablemate Low Ki and attacked Danielson by injuring his arm with a chair shot. The first match of the series between the two was a submission match which took place at "It All Begins" on January 15, 2005, which Homicide won with assistance by Julius Smokes. After the match, Rottweilers attacked Danielson but he fended off their assault and it was announced that the second match of the series between the two would be a Taped Fist match which would take place at the Third Anniversary Celebration.
At the second night of "Weekend of Thunder" on November 6, Mick Foley interrupted CM Punk after Punk and Ace Steel defeated Austin Aries and Roderick Strong in a no disqualification match and insulted ROH and targeted Samoa Joe by calling him "softcore". At "It All Begins", Foley confronted Joe by allowing him a spot in the Royal Rumble match but Joe said that he only wanted to face one WWE wrestler and that was Foley which resulted in Foley hitting him with a microphone and an assisted chair shot. This would set up a match between the two at Third Anniversary Celebration.
At "It All Begins", Havana Pitbulls were supposed to defend the ROH Tag Team Championship against The Carnage Crew, the team of CM Punk and Steve Corino and Generation Next's Roderick Strong and Jack Evans in an Ultimate Endurance match but Evans backed out of the match due to deciding to stay with either Strong or Austin Aries in Generation Next or side with former leader Alex Shelley. Strong instead defeated Punk and Corino's disciples in a gauntlet match and later attacked Corino during the Ultimate Endurance match, thus costing him the match. This led to a No Rules match between Corino and Strong at Third Anniversary Celebration.
At the night two of "Weekend of Thunder", Prince Nana helped Jimmy Rave in beating Jay Lethal in a match. However, Lethal slapped Nana after the match and retreated from the ring to avoid being attacked by The Embassy. Lethal wrestled Embassy members in various matches, leading to a match between Lethal and Rave at Third Anniversary Celebration.
At "Reborn: Stage Two", Alex Shelley walked out on Jimmy Jacobs after the two lost a Scramble match. Shelley would soon form the faction Generation Next. He wrestled Jacobs in various tag team matches and two singles matches including one grudge match at "Death Before Dishonor II" and an "I Quit" match at "Joe vs. Punk II".
Event.
Night One.
The event kicked off with Jack Evans telling Alex Shelley that he would stay in Generation Next with Austin Aries and Roderick Strong.
The opening match took place between Steve Corino and Roderick Strong. Corino's ring announcer distracted the referee and Corino's students Alex Law and Ricky Landell interfered in the match by attacking Strong. Corino countered a powerbomb by Strong and hit a lariat for the win.

Harriet Cany Peale

Harriet Christina Cany Peale (1799–1869) was an American landscape, portrait, and genre painter of the mid-nineteenth century. Although sometimes described as a copyist, a greater share of her oeuvre has been made public in recent years, allowing Cany Peale to earn recognition for her genre and landscape paintings. She has been located in contemporary scholarship as an artist of the Hudson River School.
Family.
Harriet Christina Cany was born in 1799, the daughter of Charles and Mary Cany, in Philadelphia. She was widowed sometime before 1840, and worked in her family's "fancy goods business." She studied with the artist Rembrandt Peale, whom she married in 1840, becoming his second wife. Her association with the more famous Peale usually places her within the famous Peale family of painters, overshadowing her individual achievements as an artist in her own right.
Career.
Harriet Cany Peale first exhibited in 1840 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she continued to exhibit for the rest of her life, as well as at the Artists' Fund Society. She and her husband shared a studio in Philadelphia.
Her 1848 painting, "Her Mistress's Clothes" (private collection) has gained notoriety for its exploration of power differentiation in a scene of an African American woman dressed—presumably by her employer—in a bourgeois white woman's clothes and jewelry. Cany Peale depicts the "mistress" as an ideal, serene, light-skinned figure clasping the neck of the African American servant, whose features appear cruder in contrast.

Lenore Volz

Lenore Volz (16 March 1913 – 26 September 2009) was a German Protestant theologian and one of the first women in Württemberg to work as a church minister. She was chair of the Women Theologians' Convent of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg.
Life.
Lenore Volz was born in Waiblingen, a short distance from Stuttgart, and grew up in nearby Esslingen. She was the youngest of her parents' three recorded children. Hugo Volz, her father, had a well paid job in Esslingen as a tax official which enabled him to secure a good education for his children. Her mother, born Amalie Sixt, was an education pioneer who founded the first Lutheran in Württemberg in 1928/29 and again, in the context of post-Nazi reconstruction, in 1945 "because there was literally nothing" ("weil es buchstäblich nichts gab").
Lenore Volz attended the girls' school in Esslingen and then moved on to the elite in Stuttgart. In preparation for her university studies she learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. In 1933 she enrolled as a Theology student at Tübingen University. Tübingen was a major centre for her subject, with approximately 900 Theology students: around twelve of these were women. The next year she took over leadership of the "German Christian Women Students' Movement" ("Deutschen Christlichen Studentinnenbewegung"/ DCSB ). In 1935 she transferred for a year to Greifswald on Germany's northern coast. Back in Tübingen she successfully completed her studies in 1939. In September 1939, as war broke out, Lenore Volz began her theological internship at Münsingen. After six months she was unexpectedly transferred to nearby Cannstatt where in April 1940 she was appointed "parson's female assistant" ("Pfarrgehilfin"). Because all except the oldest the ministers had been conscripted for war service she found herself conducting services. Her formal status remained unclear, but congregations evidently accepted that she was able to conduct services and preach sermons as well as male colleagues. She was not permitted to conduct weddings or funerals, which remained male preserves. Children's services and work with women's and girls' groups were more typical of the "women's work" assigned to her, along with visiting of the elderly and sick. After the minister at the hospital was called up to serve the military she also took on hospital pastoral care. Early in 1943 she passed her level 2 Theological Practicing Exam ("Theologische Dienstprüfung ") which came with the title "Pfarrvikarin" ("loosely: "parson-vicar""). However, after war ended and surviving male ministers returned from the prisoner of war camps she, and other women ministers who had been filling the men's shoes, were no longer able to conduct services before full congregations, but restricted to traditional core areas such as religious instruction in those smaller groups, restricted to children, girls and women.
One change that could not be overlooked was the continuing shortage of male clergy due primarily, at this stage, to the slaughter of war. In 1948 the regional church passed a "Law on the service of women theologians" ("Gesetz über den Dienst der Theologinnen"). As a result, female theologians were formally admitted to full time ministry by the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg. Their appointments remained subordinate ones, "dependent on the ordained parish officers" ("in Abhängigkeit vom ordinierten Pfarramt"), and the changes certainly did not deliver gender parity, but they did at the very least bring legal and financial improvements. It would need more thorough bible based theological groundwork to overcome significant residual doubts about women's ordination. By the end of the 1950s Lenore Volz would be one of the people engaged in that groundwork.
During the early 1950s Volz turned her focus to the inter-relationship between psychotherapy and pastoral care. She recognised the need for church ministers to incorporate the ground rules of psychology in their pastoral care, in order to be able to respond adequately to people's spiritual needs. The leading proponent of was the theologian , a qualified and the professor for Practical Theology at the Humboldt University in (East) Berlin till his retirement in 1959. Volz began to attend Haendler's lectures on psychology and got to know him in the course of her follow-up studies with the "Doctor and Pastor" ("Arzt und Seelsorger") community. Haendler became her mentor as she pursued her psychological studies in greater depth, providing her with a study plan and reading recommendations. For her personal education on the topic she contacted Jutta von Graevenitz with whom she underwent analysis training.
The connection between psychology and theology, especially in the context of gender relations, was at the heart of Lenore Volz's life. From 1959 she turned her attention more directly to the issue of women's ordination, working closely on the theology and politics of the issue with , another Tübingen theologian. Presentations and discussions took place which raised the matter up the church agenda.
In December 1961 Volz held a church-theological working session in the deanery at Bad Cannstatt during the course of which she gave a presentation under the title, "Has the time not come to update the 1948 Law on women theologians?" (""Ist die Theologinnen-Ordnung von 1948 revisionsbedürftig?"). The question set a stone rolling. Over the next few years she devoted herself to the issue of equal rights for women theologians. Working with the "Women Theologians' Convent" ("Konvent evangelischer Theologinnen"), of which she became president in 1965, she published in 1967 "Women in the pulpits? A burning question for our church" (""Frauen auf der Kanzel? Eine brennende Frage unserer Kirchen""). This study became the template for a new "Law on the service of women theologians" ("Gesetz über den Dienst der Theologinnen"). After a deeply felt and moving debate it was adopted by the synod on 15 November 1968. The ordination of women was a reality. As Volz noted in her biography, women pastors were now permitted "almost" the same rights as male pastors.
By this time Lenore Volz was already 55, and instead of remaining in the mainstream church ministry she became a hospital pastor, and worked on ideas for another great reform, this time to put pastoral care in hospitals on a new footing. She retired ten years later, in 1978. That was also the year in which further adjustments were made as a result of which men and women working in parish ministry finally received completely equal status and treatment from the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg. Even after her retirement she remained an active presence in evangelical church politics.

A. C. de la Mare

Albinia Catherine de la Mare, (2 June 1932 – 19 December 2001), known in print as A.C. de la Mare and informally as “Tilly”, was an English librarian and palaeographer who specialised in Italian Renaissance manuscripts.
Personal life.
Born in Gower Street, London, in 1932, she was the daughter of Richard de la Mare, director of Faber and Faber, and the granddaughter of the poet Walter de la Mare. In 1937 her family moved to an eighteenth century brick house in Much Hadham where Tilly and her younger brothers were raised. Motivated by “a strong sense of public duty”, as an adult she “serv[ed] in the Civil Defence Corps to be the better prepared to help in the event of any disaster”. Following a long illness, she died at Oxford in 2001.
Education and career.
After attending a local school in Much Hadham, de la Mare departed for a final three years at Queen’s College, Harley Street, then read history at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford. In 1954, she registered as a postgraduate student at the Warburg Institute, London. Her M.A. thesis — examining the "Vite di uomini illustri" of Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, and striving to trace the manuscripts he published — proved so promising that her supervisor, Ernst Gombrich, promoted her to a PhD dissertation under his own supervision. “It took a long time to materialise. Formally presented in 1965–66, it really lasted the rest of her life”.
As curator in the Manuscript Department of the Bodleian Library from 1962 until 1989, de la Mare became so respected that King's College London Professor of Palaeography Julian Brown “decreed on his deathbed that Tilly de la Mare and no one else should succeed him”. In 1989, she was duly appointed to the latter institution’s Chair of Palaeography, where she soon garnered praise for her “enthusiastic”, “inspirational” lecturing stye. She retired from the post in 1997.
From 1990 through 2000, de la Mare served as a counsellor to the Bureau of the prestigious Comité International de Paléographie Latine (CIPL), a scholarly organisation of which she was a committed and active member. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1987, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1993. The Warburg Institute held an academic conference commemorating her life and work in 2012, and 2016 brought publication of a volume of scholarly essays dedicated to her memory.

Invincible Napoleon (1804 ship)

Invincible Napoleon (or Invincible Bonaparte, or Invincible) was a three-masted French privateer commissioned in Bayonne in Spring 1804. She made numerous cruises until 1813–1814 when the British and the Americans repeatedly captured her. In her brief career as an American privateer she captured some 14 vessels. She finally ending up in British hands and was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia as a prize.
French privateer.
Captain Martin Jorlis commissioned "Invincible Napoleon" in spring 1804. 
She made another cruise in 1807 under Captain Michel Garat. 
From November 1809 to March 1810 she was under the command of Captain François Dermit. Her owner was Maisonnave, Bayonne. She captured three prizes: "Mary Anne", "Marie Thérèse", and "Huron". "Invincible Napoleon" captured "Huron", Clarke, master, on 21 February 1810 at as "Huron" was sailing from Virginia to Cadiz. recaptured "Huron" on 4 February; "Huron" arrived at Cowes on 16 February.
On 28 February 1810, "Invincible Napoleon" captured , Ross, master, at as "Bellona" was sailing from London to Amelia Island, Florida. The French set their prize on fire, scuttling her; "Invincible Napoleon" carried the crew into Bordeaux.
Later in 1810 "Invincible Napoleon" made another cruise under Captain Jorlis.
In January 1811, she took the name "Invincible", and did several more cruises under Captain Jorlis between February 1811 and April 1813. "Lloyd's List" reported on 29 January 1811 that "Invincible Napoleon" had captured "Hope", Orchard, master, as "Hope" was sailing from Newfoundland to Poole. However, HMS "Armide" recaptured "Hope", which arrived at Plymouth on 23 January. On 25 January "Invincible Bonaparte" had captured "Sir Sydney Smith", Lewis, master, at as "Sir Sydney Smith" was coming to England from Prince Edward Island. "Invincible Bonaparte" put on board "Sir Sydney Smith" the crews of three vessels that "Invincible Bonaparte" had captured and burnt:
"Sir Sydney Smith" arrived at Plymouth on 2 February. Also on 2 February "Invincible Bonapart" captured "Packet", from Boston to Liverpool. recaptured "Packet" and sent her into Cork.
Also in February "Invincible Napoleon" captured the American vessel "Sally", Webber, master, as "Sally" was sailing from Charleston to Liverpool. The sloop of war HMS "Acteon" recaptured "Sally", which arrived at Plymouth on 13 February.
Captures and recaptures.
Captured: On 17 April 1813, captured "Invincible", or "Invincible Napoleon", off Spain. "Mutine" took her crew, some of whom were Americans, prisoner. "Mutine" had suffered only two men slightly wounded in the engagement. "Mutine" sent "Invincible" into Oporto.
Recaptured twice: The American privateer "Alexander", of Salem, recaptured "Invincible", or "Invincible Napoleon", on 27 April 1813 at , or in the Channel. She had arrived within sight of Salem when the frigates and on 16 May chased her on shore. She was out of range of the guns of the fort at Cape Ann and a few shots from the frigates dispersed the militia that had gathered. The frigates then sent their boats in and succeeded in recovering her. The British sent "Invincible" to Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Fourth capture: "Invincible" did not reach Halifax. The American privateer "Young Teazer" re-re-captured her and sent her into Portland, where she arrived around 1 June.
American privateer &amp; fifth capture.
"Invincible" became an American privateer based in Salem, Massachusetts under the command of Captain Peter Destebecho, or New York, under the command and ownership of Peter Destebecho, Jr. She was commissioned on 18 December. Consequently, there are references to ""Invincible", of Salem", or ""Invincible" of New York". She captured 14 or 15 vessels, of which only five reached American ports, in part because she didn't bother to take as prizes a number of small vessels.
American records report that "Invincible" captured one ship sailing from Liverpool to Antigua in ballast that she sent into Wilmington. This may have been "Lady Prevost", of London.

"Armide" captured "Invincible" on 16 August. and "Pique" were in company with "Armide" at the time.
"Invincible" arrived at Halifax on 21 August. "Invincible" had been sailing from Charleston to New York when the British captured her after a long chase during which she had thrown ten of her guns overboard.
 recaptured "Helen", which then arrived at Halifax on 18 August. HMS "Tenedos" recaptured "Wanderer" and bought her into Halifax on 22 August. "Lloyd's List" further reported that "Invincible" gave up her other four prizes to their masters and crews.

Ballynahatty woman

The Ballynahatty Woman is the name given to a prehistoric female human found in the townland of Ballynahatty near Belfast in 1855. She is estimated to have lived about 5,000 years ago. In 2015, her genome, along with that of a trio of men who lived 4,000 years ago, was sequenced by geneticists at Trinity College Dublin and archaeologists at Queen's University Belfast.
Both Ballynahatty Woman and one of the men were found to have mutations that can cause hemochromatosis, a disease where the body retains too much iron and has a high prevalence in the British Isles. She was found to have Neolithic Anatolian ancestry, and out of modern peoples most genetically resembles the inhabitants of Spain and Sardinia

Juice Wrld

Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 – December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld (pronounced "juice world"; stylized as Juice WRLD), was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. His 2018 single "Lucid Dreams" has been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one billion times and peaked at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams", along with his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film "Juice" and stated that it represents taking over the world. He is considered as a leading figure in the emo-rap and SoundCloud rap genres which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-late 2010s.
"All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles included on Higgins' debut studio album "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance" (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and contained three other singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Hot 100. After collaborating with Future on the mixtape "Wrld on Drugs" (2018), Higgins released his second studio album "Death Race for Love" (2019) alongside the singles "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling"; "Death Race for Love" debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200, becoming the artist's first album to top the chart.
Higgins died following a drug overdose at Chicago's Midway International Airport. His first posthumous album, "Legends Never Die" (2020), debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200. The album was the most successful posthumous chart debut in over 20 years and matched a record for the most top-ten song entries on the Hot 100 at one time. The album's fourth single "Come &amp; Go" with Marshmello became Higgins' second song to reach number two on the Hot 100 after "Lucid Dreams".
Early life.
Jarad Anthony Higgins was born on December 2, 1998, in Chicago, Illinois. He grew up in the South Suburbs spending his childhood in Calumet Park and later moving to Homewood, where he attended Homewood-Flossmoor High School and graduated in 2017. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his father left, leaving his mother to raise him and an older brother as a single parent. Higgins' mother was very religious and conservative, and did not let him listen to hip hop. He was allowed to listen to rock and pop music, however, being introduced to artists including Billy Idol, Blink-182, Black Sabbath, Fall Out Boy, Megadeth and Panic! at the Disco through video games such as "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" and "Guitar Hero".
Higgins was a heavy drug user during his childhood and teens. He began drinking lean in sixth grade and using percocets and xanax in 2013. Higgins also smoked cigarettes briefly before quitting in his last year of high school because of health issues.
He learned to play the piano at four years old, having been inspired by his mother, Carmella Wallace, who later began paying for lessons. He then took up the guitar and drums while also playing the trumpet for band class. In his sophomore year of high school, he began posting songs to SoundCloud which he recorded on his smartphone. Around this time, Higgins began to take rapping more seriously.
Career.
2015–2017: Beginnings, record deal, and early projects.
Higgins began to develop as an artist in his first year of high school. His first track, "Forever", was released on SoundCloud in 2015 under the name JuicetheKidd. Higgins recorded most of his first tracks on a cellphone, uploading them to SoundCloud in his sophomore year. He changed his name from JuicetheKidd, a name inspired by his affection for rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film "Juice", to Juice Wrld because he and his associates believed the change would benefit his career. In an interview with the Atlanta radio station WHTA, Higgins revealed that the latter part of his stage name initially had no meaning but that he came to think it "represents taking over the world".
"Too Much Cash", Higgins' first track to be produced by frequent collaborator Nick Mira, was released in 2017. While releasing projects and songs on SoundCloud, Higgins worked in a factory but was dissatisfied with the job; he was fired within two weeks. After joining the internet collective Internet Money, Higgins released his debut full-length EP, "9 9 9", on June 15, 2017, with the song "Lucid Dreams" breaking out and growing his following.
In mid-2017, he began to receive attention from artists such as Waka Flocka Flame and Southside, as well as fellow Chicago artists G Herbo and Lil Bibby. He subsequently signed with Lil Bibby's co-owned record label, Grade A Productions.
2017–2018: "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance" and WRLD Domination Tour.
In December 2017, Higgins released the three-song EP "Nothings Different". The project was covered by the hip-hop blog Lyrical Lemonade, with Higgins' track "All Girls Are the Same" gaining popularity through the blog post and an accompanying Cole Bennett-directed music video that was released in February 2018. Following the video's release, Interscope Records signed Higgins for $3 million and a remix featuring Lil Yachty was previewed but never officially released. "All Girls Are the Same" was critically acclaimed, receiving a Best New Music designation from "Pitchfork". It was released as a single in April. "All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were Higgins' first entries on any "Billboard" chart, debuting on the Hot 100 at numbers 92 and 74, respectively.
On May 4, 2018, "Lucid Dreams" was officially released as a single and accompanied by a Cole Bennett-directed music video, similarly to "All Girls Are the Same". It peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and quickly became one of the most streamed songs of 2018; it remains his most-streamed song, reaching over one billion streams on Spotify by January 2020. "Lucid Dreams" was followed by "Lean Wit Me" on May 22, which peaked at number 68 on the Hot 100; Higgins' debut full-length album, "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance", which included his three previous singles, released the following day. On June 19, he released a two-song EP titled "Too Soon.." in remembrance of, and dedicated to, deceased rappers Lil Peep and XXXTentacion. Lil Peep died of an overdose in 2017 and XXXTentacion was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on June 18, 2018, one day before the project was released. Higgins said that he and XXXTentacion were friends and that they would have FaceTime calls together, revealing that their last conversation was about meeting up. The cover of the "Too Soon.." EP is a screenshot of a conversation between Higgins and XXXTentacion. The song "Legends" from the EP debuted at number 65 on the Hot 100 and peaked at number 29 over a year later following Higgins' death.
"Wasted" featuring Lil Uzi Vert was released on July 10; it was Higgins' first single featuring a collaboration and the only song on "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance" with a featured guest. It debuted at number 68 on the Hot 100 and peaked at 67 in its second week on the chart. On July 11, Higgins announced that he was working on his next album. On July 20, Higgins announced his first tour, WRLD Domination, with additional acts YBN Cordae and Lil Mosey. On July 25, Higgins' producer Danny Wolf released the official version of "Motions" on SoundCloud following a series of leaks.
2018–2019: "Wrld on Drugs" and "Death Race for Love".
Travis Scott's song "No Bystanders", from his third studio album, "Astroworld", featured Higgins and Sheck Wes. The song peaked at number 31 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Higgins made his late night television debut performing the song "Lucid Dreams" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on August 8, 2018. On October 15, the music video for the song "Armed and Dangerous" was released followed by the lead single, "Fine China", from the collaborative mixtape, "Wrld on Drugs" with Future. Epic Records released the mixtape on October 19. He collaborated with American singer Seezyn for the song "Hide" from the film "" and its , both of which were released on December 14, 2018.
In a December 2018 interview with "XXL", Ski Mask the Slump God confirmed that he would be releasing a joint mixtape with Higgins titled "Evil Twins" in 2019; as of 2021, the project has yet to be released. The pair also announced a 2019 tour featuring 30 concerts across North America. Higgins' second studio album, "Death Race for Love", was released on March 8, 2019, preceded by the singles "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling". The album topped the "Billboard" 200 chart. He then embarked on The Nicki Wrld Tour, alongside Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj. Higgins released the music video for the song "Fast" from "Death Race for Love" on April 9. Later that year, he released other singles: "All Night" with RM and Suga of BTS; "Hate Me" with Ellie Goulding; "Run"; "Graduation" with Benny Blanco; and "Bandit" with NBA YoungBoy, the last song to be released by Higgins' before his death. It peaked at number ten on the Hot 100.
2020–present: Posthumous releases.
Higgins' first posthumous appearance was on Eminem's eleventh studio album "Music to Be Murdered By" on the track "Godzilla", released on January 17, 2020. "Godzilla" peaked at number three on the Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. On January 22, an announcement was posted on Higgins' Instagram account by members of his family and the team at Grade A Productions which thanked fans for their adoration for Higgins and confirmed their intention to release music that he was working on at the time of his death.
Higgins was included on the title track of G Herbo's fourth studio album "PTSD", released on February 28. The track features vocals by Lil Uzi Vert and Chance the Rapper. "PTSD" marked the first time that Higgins and Lil Uzi Vert had collaborated on a song since "Wasted". On March 13, a remix of the single "Suicidal", from YNW Melly's debut studio album "Melly vs. Melvin", featuring vocals from Higgins, was released. The remix included a different verse and outro Higgins had recorded. The song reappeared on the Hot 100 and peaked at number 20 following the release of the remix. The single "No Me Ame", a multilingual collaboration among Higgins, Jamaican record producer Rvssian and Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA, was released on April 17. A computer-generated image depicting Higgins as an angel appears in the background of the song's music video.
Higgins' first posthumous single, "Righteous", was released on April 24 and an accompanying music video featuring footage of Higgins was uploaded to his YouTube channel. Higgins had recorded the song at his home studio in Los Angeles. On May 4, Higgins' girlfriend, Ally Lotti, announced that his upcoming third album and first posthumous album would be titled "The Outsiders". On May 29, the song "Tell Me U Luv Me" featuring Trippie Redd was released alongside a music video directed by Cole Bennett. "Go", Higgins' collaboration with Australian rapper the Kid Laroi (whom Higgins mentored), was released on June 12.
On July 6, it was announced that the title of Higgins' first posthumous album had been changed to "Legends Never Die". Between the album's announcement and its release, two single collaborations were released; "Life's a Mess" featuring Halsey and "Come &amp; Go" featuring Marshmello. The album was released on July 10, with 21 songs and four singles that Higgins' estate claims "best represents the music Juice was in the process of creating". The album debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200. Five of its songs reached the top 10 of the Hot 100 on the week ending July 25: "Come &amp; Go", "Wishing Well", "Conversations", "Life's a Mess", and "Hate the Other Side" (a collaboration with Polo G and The Kid Laroi), which reached number two, five, seven, nine, and ten, respectively. Higgins is the third artist to accomplish this feat; the other artists being the Beatles and Drake. "Life's a Mess" jumped from number 74 to number nine that week. "Wishing Well", which had been critically lauded following the album's release, was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio as the album's fifth single on July 28. On August 6, "Smile" with the Weeknd was released as a single. "Smile" had previously been leaked on YouTube and SoundCloud under the title "Sad" over a year before, though with an open verse in place of the Weeknd's.
On October 23, Lil Bibby confirmed that a second posthumous album was in the works. On December 2, which would have been Higgins' twenty-second birthday, Benny Blanco released a collaborative single titled "Real Shit". Six days later, on December 8, the anniversary of his death, "Reminds Me of You" featuring the Kid Laroi was released. In 2020, Higgins was streamed on Spotify over 5.9 billion times, making him the fourth most streamed artist in the world.
On January 15, 2021, Higgins' estate released "Bad Boy" featuring Young Thug, which was accompanied by a Cole Bennett-directed music video shot entirely before Higgins' death; this marks the final collaboration between the artist and director before the former's passing. On March 5, "Life's a Mess II", an alternative version of the track "Life's a Mess" from "Legends Never Die", featuring Clever and Post Malone was released. On May 28, Higgins' debut full-length album "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance" was re-released to commemorate its third anniversary; the re-release includes two new songs, one titled "734" and the other being a remix of "Lucid Dreams" featuring Lil Uzi Vert. The 2018 single "Armed and Dangerous", which was included on the December 2018 Spotify and Tidal reissue of the album, is excluded from the revised tracklist. On July 19, Lil Bibby teased at another posthumous album titled "The Party Never Ends" which is set to be the first in a trilogy of albums.
Artistry and legacy.
Musical style.
Higgins said his musical influences were genre-wide from rock to rap music, and that his biggest influences were rappers Travis Scott, Chief Keef, Kanye West and British rock singer Billy Idol. "Billboard" writer Michael Saponara claimed, "If West and his sparse "808s" were a tree, it would have grown another branch with the blossoming art displayed by fellow Chicago native Juice WRLD in 2018". Higgins was among the ranks of openly vulnerable artists born from the emo rap scene inspired by West's influential fourth album, "808s &amp; Heartbreak" (2008). During an interview with All Def Music, Higgins said, "I was singing "Street Lights" like I had shit to be sad about. Kanye [West] is a time traveler. That nigga went to damn near 2015 and came back with some sauce". His other influences included Wu-Tang Clan, Quietdrive, Fall Out Boy, Black Sabbath, the Starting Line, the Cranberries, the City Drive, 2Pac, Eminem, XXXTentacion, Kid Cudi and Escape the Fate. 
Higgins' music has been branded as "emo" and "rock" leaning, "genre-bending" with music focusing on "every broken heart, every wounded feeling". More specifically, he has been labeled as a hip hop, trap, emo rap, and SoundCloud rap artist. With a penchant for short, hook-heavy songs, Higgins seemed a leading figure for the current era of hip-hop. In 2018, the streaming platform Spotify named "emo rap" its fastest growing genre. Higgins achieved arguably the most mainstream success of any artist in the sub-genre. This was boosted by his collaboration with Panic! at the Disco frontman Brendon Urie. Higgins himself considered the emo label to be both negative and positive as he felt music sometimes has to be a bit dark to reflect his belief that the world is not really a light or a happy place.
Higgins said that "Lucid Dreams" was the only track from "Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance" that he wrote, while the rest was done impromptu. Rather than write down his rhymes, Higgins crafted whole songs in a few minutes by way of off-the-cuff rhyming. Most of the time, his songwriting process involved freestyling lyrics instead of writing them down. When he did write a song, it usually began with hearing a beat and instantaneously conceiving an idea, although Higgins sometimes found himself alone with an idea for a song and afraid that he would be unable to remember it hours later after arriving at the studio. For this reason, he sometimes took a voice memo or simply wrote the whole song.
Higgins saw the value in his position as one of very few contemporary SoundCloud artists who could compose soul-bearing ballads and odes but remain comfortable freestyle rapping over classic hip hop beats. Rather than eschewing it, his freestyles emphasize wordplay and feel indebted to the art form's tradition. When asked for his opinion on why freestyles are no longer considered the rite of passage in hip hop culture as they once were he replied, "Stuff is just changing, that's all. We're moving into a new era of music. I feel like it's not necessarily a good thing to forget where shit started, but shit is changing". Though his songs do not always feature very technical lyricism, intricate flows or tongue-twisting wordplay, Higgins delivered inventive flows and memorable bars during his freestyles.
Lyrical themes.
His most successful singles express melodic, emo-inspired compositions that exhibit his songwriting skill. His songs harbor melodic flows to complement their melancholic subjects. Higgins claimed he talked about things others are thinking but are afraid to speak about, such as being vulnerable and hurt. Having built a following through emo rap, Higgins offered lyrics that touch on heartbreak and fragmented feelings. Though not entirely groundbreaking, his musical approach provided a sense of familiarity that heartbroken adolescents of the current generation could gravitate towards. Higgins maintained that he only wrote from personal experience, and found strength in his pain and vulnerability. While the lyrical content of his songs often centered on heartache and bitterness, there are occasionally more boastful lines and creative references.
Personal life.
Higgins had a history of drug abuse that began at an early age, and he spoke openly about his experiences. His mother claimed that he was also dealing with anxiety and depression on top of his battle with drug addiction. Higgins had agreed to attend drug rehabilitation weeks prior to his death.
He was living in Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Ally Lotti, at the time of his death. The pair revealed that they were dating via Instagram in November 2018.
Higgins had stated in interviews that he disliked President Donald Trump, describing him as, "not thorough for this country".
Death.
On December 8, 2019, Higgins was aboard a private Gulfstream jet flying from Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles to Midway International Airport in Chicago. Law enforcement officers were waiting for the jet to arrive, having been notified by federal agents, while the flight was en route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. Law enforcement officials later revealed that they found of marijuana on the aircraft and said several members of Higgins' management team aboard the flight told them that Higgins had taken "several unknown pills", including allegedly swallowing multiple Percocet pills to hide them while police were on board the plane searching the luggage. 
Higgins then began convulsing and seizing, after which two doses of the emergency medication Narcan were administered as an opioid overdose was suspected. Higgins was transported to the nearby Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead. On January 22, 2020, the Cook County Medical Examiner stated that Higgins died as a result of toxic levels of oxycodone and codeine present in his system. Higgins' funeral was held on December 13, 2019, at the Holy Temple Cathedral Church of God in Christ in Harvey, Illinois. Friends and family were in attendance, including collaborators Ski Mask the Slump God and Young Thug.
Reaction.
Fellow rapper Boosie Badazz suggested that the pilot of the plane was ultimately responsible for Higgins' death, referring to him as a snitch. Higgins had been under suspicion by Federal authorities following an incident that occurred in November 2019 before he departed for Australia which prompted a search of his plane. Badazz gave an interview threatening violence upon the pilot, before later calming down and reflecting on the dangers of young artists suddenly being overwhelmed with money.
American rapper Ski Mask the Slump God, Higgins' close friend whom he collaborated with on the hit song "Nuketown", said on Twitter "They keep taking my brothers from me", referring also to best friend and longtime collaborator XXXTentacion, who was shot and killed in June 2018. Lil Yachty, who remixed Higgins' song "All Girls Are the Same" mourned his death along with Lil Uzi Vert, Drake, the Weeknd and others.
Higgins' mother expressed hope that her son's legacy would help others in their battles with addiction saying, "Addiction knows no boundaries, and its impact goes beyond the person fighting it ... We know that Jarad's legacy of love, joy and emotional honesty will live on". She later established the Live Free 999 Fund in honor of Higgins and the battle he fought against addiction, anxiety and depression. The fund's primary goal is to support programs that target young and underserved populations. With a focus on addiction, anxiety and depression, the organization hopes to normalize the conversation about the mental health challenges that Higgins faced, and provide an avenue for people to process those challenges in a healthy way. Higgins' production team and record label have committed to supporting the organization.
In his song, "Legends"—which was dedicated to XXXTentacion, who was murdered in mid-2018 at age 20, and Lil Peep, who overdosed in late 2017 at age 21—Higgins raps "What's the 27 Club? / We ain't making it past 21". Fans and media outlets commented that he had predicted his own death, as he had died only days after his twenty-first birthday.

Death Before Dishonor XVI

Death Before Dishonor XVI was a two night professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor (ROH), which took place on September 28 and 29, 2018 at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first night was a pay-per-view broadcast, while night two was a set of TV tapings for the company's flagship program "Ring of Honor Wrestling".
Wrestlers from New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) — with which ROH has a partnership — also appeared on the card.
Storylines.
Death Before Dishonor XVI will feature professional wrestling matches, involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on ROH's television programs. Wrestlers portrayed villains or heroes as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main event of Death Before Dishonor XVI featured Jay Lethal defending the ROH World Championship against Will Ospreay. On August 25, 2018, during the "Ring of Honor Wrestling" tapings, Ospreay returned to ROH in a pre-taped vignette, challenging Lethal to a match for the ROH World Championship. Afterwards, Lethal accepted the match.
In the Women of Honor World Championship match, Sumie Sakai defended her title against Tenille Dashwood. On August 25, 2018, during the "Ring of Honor Wrestling" tapings, after Sakai defeated Tasha Steelz, Sakai stated that defeating Dashwood would validate her championship reign. Dashwood then came to the ring and accepted the challenge. Sakai had previously defeated Dashwood in the semifinals of the Women of Honor Championship on April 7 at Supercard of Honor XII.

Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse

The Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse occurred on March 15, 2018, when a 175-foot-long (53 m) section of the FIU-Sweetwater UniversityCity Pedestrian Bridge collapsed while under construction. The collapse resulted in six deaths (one worker and five motorists), ten injuries (six serious and 4 minor), and eight vehicles being crushed underneath. Of the serious injuries, one employee was permanently disabled. At the time of the collapse, six lanes of road beneath the bridge were open to traffic.
The pedestrian bridge was designed to connect the town of Sweetwater to the campus of Florida International University (FIU) in University Park, a suburb west of Miami, Florida, United States. The two were separated by a busy eight-lane highway, which the bridge was designed to span.
The engineering design error that directly led to the collapse was identified by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as a miscalculation of resistance to sliding of the connection between the walkway surface, and the truss that held it up. The walkway surface was poured concrete, which was allowed to harden before the truss braces were poured above it. These truss members were connected to the deck by steel reinforcing rods embedded in the deck and in the concrete of the truss. In order to hold up the bridge these connections had to prevent the truss from sliding along the walkway surface. The resistance to sliding was miscalculated, and thus was not enough to prevent the connection from sliding causing cracks in the truss concrete. As the cracking enlarged, it ultimately caused the complete disconnection of one of the truss-to-walkway connections, leading to the collapse.
"The New York Times" concluded that "the chief probable cause" was "the design by FIGG Bridge Engineers", and that "every company, institution and agency involved in the project was partly to blame for the bridge collapse."
Background.
The FIU Sweetwater UniversityCity pedestrian bridge, located just west of the intersection of Tamiami Trail (Southwest 8th Street) and Southwest 109th Avenue, was planned to connect the FIU campus to student housing neighborhoods in Sweetwater. It was intended to improve pedestrian safety, as the crosswalks at this wide, busy intersection had been identified as a safety hazard, and one student had already been struck and killed by a vehicle. The $14.2 million project was funded with a $19.4 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant from the United States Department of Transportation in 2013, along with state agencies. The bridge cost $9 million to construct, exclusive of the installation cost.
The main companies behind the construction project were Munilla Construction Management (MCM), a Miami-based construction management firm, and FIGG Bridge Engineers, a Tallahassee-based firm. Unlike most bridges in Florida, the design for this project was overseen by the university, not the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), in a program known as the Local Agency Program (LAP).
Florida International University is known for its expertise in accelerated bridge construction (ABC) and has attracted international scholars as PhD students. It is home to the federally-funded Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center, which sponsors industry conferences and seminars. The National Transportation Safety Board, however, found that with respect to the bridge, "F.I.U. had no professional engineers on its staff and relied solely on the expertise of its hired contractors."
Bridge layout.
The full pedestrian bridge was to cross both a major roadway and a parallel water canal with two separate spans connected at a faux cable-stayed tower. The main roadway-crossing span was 175 ft long, and the shorter canal span was to be 99 ft long. An elevator and stairs at the south end added 31 ft, and at the north end, 15 feet, for a total bridge length of 320 feet. At the bridge site, the Tamiami Trail roadway has seven lanes of traffic plus one turn lane.
The school was on spring break at the time of collapse. The canal span, access ramps, and faux cable-stayed tower had not yet been built. Pedestrian use was to begin when the entire project was complete. The section of the bridge that collapsed weighed and fell onto several vehicles on the roadway below.
Bridge design and construction.
The new pedestrian bridge was designed to connect the campus to student housing in a dramatic, sculptural way and also to showcase the school's leadership in the ABC method of rapid bridge construction. The bridge was meant to last more than 100 years, and to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, according to a statement by the university.
The full bridge project was styled to look like a cable-stayed bridge, with a pylon tower and high cables for dramatic effect, but functionally and structurally it was actually a mono truss bridge, with the spans being fully self-supporting. The bridge spans used a novel concrete truss design invented for this project, a "re-invented I-beam concept." Concrete truss bridges are "exceedingly rare," and "no other designs similar to the FIU bridge" have been discovered. The vertical web of the beam was a series of triangulated concrete diagonal struts along the centerline, and the diagonal angles of the struts varied across the bridge so they would align with pipes from the center pylon, in the eventual faux cable-stayed appearance. The concrete walkway deck was to act as the horizontal bottom flange of a wide I-beam, and the concrete roof canopy was to function as the horizontal top flange of the I-beam. The walkway was thus nearer to ground level than in a standard design where the walkway is placed on top of the structural support system. This reduced the number of steps to climb.
The bridge was a post-tensioned concrete structure. Concrete structures are generally ten times heavier than equivalent steel designs. The bridge was made using a new formulation for concrete, intended to stay cleaner than standard concrete formulations. In the main bridge span, the concrete floor deck, roof, and most diagonal struts contained post-tensioning (PT) members whose compressive effect on the concrete was adjusted after the concrete was cured but prior to loading.
The deck and the canopy had PT "cables" that were permanently tensioned after the concrete was cured and while the main span was still located in the staging yard. Most of the diagonal truss members, also known as tendons, had two to four PT "rods" that could be tightened or loosened depending on the engineer's design plan. The high-strength steel rods are sleeved to allow free movement, with only their ends in contact with the concrete to provide a clamping force. This applied tension is necessary to keep concrete members in compression. All of the adjustable tendon rods were oriented with the nut end on top of the canopy, hidden with a "blister" of extra concrete. Adjusting the rods generally required a crane and the specialized crew of a subcontractor.
Two tendons of the main span, particularly the ones nearest the support ends, had PT rods designed for "temporarily" prestressing the concrete tendons during the movement of the 950-ton span. These four PT rods were tightened explicitly for the day it took to transport the main span over 8th Street and de-stressed (loosened) immediately thereafter. The purpose of the temporary prestressing of the two end tendons was due to the different loads during movement. The transporter's four-point support of the massive span essentially forces the two terminal ends of the bridge span to be cantilevered past the supports, unlike its final placement. To keep the bridge stable during transport, the four PT rods were torqued to each apply a load of . The other PT rods, inside the other tendons, were tightened just once and considered permanent. The transport of the prefabricated, 950-ton span (see below) to its location over 8th Street was performed five days before the subsequent collapse.
A specification change from the FDOT late in the planning phase required relocating central pier 11 feet (3 meters) north to allow for future widening of the highway, causing some changes in construction.
Construction of the bridge began in March 2016 and was scheduled to be completed in December 2018. The bridge's main span was assembled adjacent to the highway using accelerated bridge construction. It was lifted into place on the morning of March 10, five days before the collapse, during a weekend closure of the roadway.
Collapse.
Reports of cracking.
The main span of the bridge was in place by around 11:30 am on March 10. Inspections were performed, and the order was given to release the tension on the steel pretensioned (PT) tendons at the terminal ends of the span. Kevin Hanson, the supervisor of the de-stressing operation of the PT tendons, became aware that cracks formed on the north side of the bridge and was concerned. He sent a text message to his supervisor, Sam Nunez, stating that "it cracked like hell" and included photos of the location near where the detensioned tendons were located. Pedro Cortes and other members of the construction contractor reviewed the cracking and took photos. These cracks were located in the area where the bridge contacts its supporting pier, where the structural diaphragm deck was located. Other cracks were observed in the northernmost diagonal truss member.
Two days before the collapse, on March 13, the engineer of record (EOR) from FIGG became aware of the cracks and began calculating remedial action, including the addition of plastic shims under the diaphragm. He then reported the cracking by voicemail to an FDOT employee. He thought this was not an immediate safety issue, merely something that would need to be repaired later. The FDOT recipient was away for several days and did not hear this message until the day after the collapse. FIGG's engineer of record then decided to re-tension the temporary PT rods in the northernmost tendon to their state on March 10. This plan was developed by FIGG over the 13th and 14th from the FIGG office in Tallahassee, and a meeting was scheduled for March 15 at 9:00 am in a trailer at the construction site.
Now in Miami, two FIGG engineers including the EOR arrived before the meeting to inspect the bridge span along with some of the managers of the consulting engineering firm and the main construction company. They used a lift to get a close view of the damage.
At 9 a.m. on March 15, a university employee heard a loud "whip cracking" sound while under the bridge span, waiting for a red traffic light. At the same time, the design-build team met for about two hours at the construction site to discuss the cracks discovered on March 10. Representatives from both FIU and FDOT were present. The FIGG lead engineer's conclusions were that the structural integrity of the bridge was not compromised and that there were no safety concerns raised by the presence of the crack. FIGG also insisted that no crack repairs should be carried out until the stabilizing of the node and pylon diaphragm with post-tensioning was completed.
An additional measure proposed by FIGG at the meeting to remediate the cracking was telling the contractor that it "must expedite the pouring of the intermediate pylon," a structure that was designed to mimic the tower of a cable-stay bridge. This pylon was to be located on the north end of the main span adjacent to the area that failed and affixed to the same substructure that the failing main span diaphragm sat upon.
The FIGG engineers on site "did not know the reason for the cracks, but still expressed no safety concerns" at the meeting.
Immediately after the meeting between FIGG employees and FIU, FDOT, BPA (Bolton Perez and Associates, Inc., the construction engineering and inspection firm), and MCM (the main construction contractor); the pretensioning crew from Structural Technologies (US licensee of VSL tensioned-concrete technology) began to re-stress the two PT rods in diagonal truss member 11 to 280,000 pounds each. Due to the urgency and short notice demanded by the EOR, the post-tensioning inspection subcontractor, the Corradino Group, was unavailable to monitor this process. FIGG employees, including the EOR, had gone back to Tallahassee. VSL had just completed the procedure, and still had some of their equipment attached and a crane in the air, when the bridge collapsed.
Collapse.
At 1:47 p.m. on March 15, the north end of the installed bridge span had a blow-out as the northernmost tendon (11) sheared the remaining rebar in adjacent vertical truss member (12) at the cold joint (node) where truss members 11 and 12 join the deck. The span sagged deeply as the diagonal fractured, folded, and immediately dropped the heavy full span onto the roadway below. A dashcam video shows that the blowout, collapse, and impact sequence took only a few video frames.
United States Senator and FIU adjunct professor Marco Rubio tweeted that engineers were tightening loosened cables on March 15: "Workers were adding more tension to the steel rod (tendon) inside a concrete diagonal strut at the north end".
Aftermath.
Six people were killed and ten were injured. Five of the victims were killed immediately when the bridge fell; one died at the hospital. Navaro Brown, aged 37, who worked for VSL, the company contracted to apply post-tensioning, died in the collapse. Two other employees of VSL were hospitalized. The other people killed were Alberto Arias, 53, Brandon Brownfield, 39, FIU student Alexa Duran, 18, Rolando Fraga, 60, and Oswaldo Gonzalez, 57.
At the time of the collapse, the roadway was open, and multiple eastbound cars were stopped at a traffic light under the span. Eight cars were crushed. A driver who survived the collapse reported that small rocks fell onto her car just before the front of her car was crushed. A worker saved himself when he heard cracking and locked his safety harness just before the collapse.
Southwest 8th Street between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues was closed until March 24 while the debris was cleared.
Inquiry.
On March 15, 2018, the NTSB launched a Go-team of 15 people to investigate the bridge collapse. The accident number assigned was HWY18MH009. On March 16, 2018 the NTSB Investigators held their first press conference to discuss the inquiry into the bridge collapse. Noteworthy points from the meeting included a statement that the inquiry was in the very early stages, that cracks in the bridge superstructure did not necessarily make the bridge unsafe, that on-site investigations would take about a week, that preserving perishable evidence was crucial, and that bridge workers were applying a "post-tensioning force" on the bridge before the failure. Also on March 16, 2018, the FDOT released a letter to the public with information about the bridge collapse:
On March 21, 2018, the NTSB sent out a press release detailing the items from the collapse that required further examination at the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center, in McLean, Virginia. They also confirmed workers were adjusting rod tension when the collapse occurred.
On May 23, 2018, the NTSB released a preliminary report titled "Highway: Collapse of Pedestrian Bridge Under Construction Miami, Florida (HWY18MH009)" which summarized the accident. They said they are evaluating the emergence of cracks in the region of diagonal members 2 (south end of the bridge) and 11 (north end of bridge), and the propagation of cracks in the region of diagonal member 11. Pictures of the cracks from February 24 (before the walkway had been moved into place) were also given. Consulting engineers Bolton-Perez and Associates, had taken several pictures of severe cracks in diagonal member 11 and adjacent to vertical member 12 which had appeared when the bridge was moved into place on March 10.&lt;ref name="NTSB-8/9/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NTSB-8/9/2018-pdf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, at the request of the NTSB, tested samples of steel and concrete from the collapsed bridge, and found that the materials met the project requirements. The NTSB similarly asked the FHWA to examine the design of the bridge. The FHWA examination discovered that the bridge designers had overestimated the strength of one section of the bridge — at the point where the diagonal member 11 and vertical member 12 met the bridge deck — and underestimated the load that that same section would carry.
In June 2019, OSHA released its final report on the FIU bridge collapse and concluded FIGG Bridge Engineers failed to recognize collapse was imminent when they inspected the bridge hours earlier. They also concluded the bridge had structural design deficiencies, severe cracks were wrongly ignored by the Engineer of Record and warranted street closure, and contract bridge design experts violated basic FDOT construction requirements. The NTSB quickly disapproved of this release by OSHA, citing "a breach of party participation rules" and "contrary to party agreement obligations, OSHA released a report to the public that contained large portions of nonpublic draft NTSB material and failed to provide investigative photographs to the NTSB as required by its status as a party to the investigation."
On October 8, 2019, the NTSB released over 6,000 pages relating to its investigation of the collapse, including letters submitted to the NTSB by the various companies associated with the bridge construction. A final NTSB public hearing on the bridge accident was held October 22, 2019, in Washington, D.C., and concluded "that load and capacity calculation errors made by FIGG Bridge Engineers, Inc., are the probable cause of the fatal, March 15, 2018, Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse in Miami." The final Highway Accident Report by the NTSB was finalized the same day and released as NTSB/HAR-19/02.
Legal action.
On March 19, 2018, the first civil lawsuit was filed against FIGG Bridge Engineers, MCM, Bolton Perez &amp; Associates, the project's consulting engineer, Louis Berger, and Network Engineering Services for reckless negligence.
On March 21, 2018, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked the department's inspector general to probe whether the federally funded pedestrian bridge complied with all rules. A subsequent internal memorandum from the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation, dated March 22, 2018, expressed concerns the project complied with Federal specifications, and that the objective of an audit will be to assess whether the Florida International University pedestrian bridge met Federal and DOT requirements for the TIGER application, approval, and grant agreement processes
On March 28, 2018, the Miami Herald reported they were denied access to FIU documents related to the bridge construction, citing federal regulations that prevent release of non-public information related to the bridge construction and design project when an NTSB investigation is in progress. A lawyer for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press indicated more information should be released under the Florida Sunshine Law, citing intense public interest in the collapse. On May 2, 2018, the Miami Herald filed a lawsuit against FDOT in Florida's Leon County Circuit Court to compel the FDOT to release emails, meeting minutes and other records relating to the bridge's design and construction. On May 3, 2018, a lawyer for the NTSB wrote a letter to Judge Cooper of the 2nd Judicial Circuit of Florida in Tallahassee urging the court to deny a ruling that would favor the Miami Herald plaintiff, for the release of any bridge information generated after a February 19, 2018, cutoff date.
On May 7, 2018, the Miami Herald reported they had received a copy of a memo with photographs from FIU dated February 28, 2018, that had been sent to the Munilla Construction Management company, the bridge project's builder. The memo, which has since been rescinded back from Public view, purportedly urged the bridge engineer to respond to their concerns about significant cracks in the concrete joint at connection between the No. 11 truss and the bridge deck.
On August 21, 2018, Leon County Circuit Judge Kevin Carroll ruled the FDOT "shall produce to The Herald the requested records, but that production shall be limited to records from February 20th to March 15th (prior to the collapse)." However, two days later and just as the FDOT was about to release documents, the Florida State ruling was temporarily blocked by U.S. District Court Judge William Stafford on a request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida (on behalf of the NTSB, who is seeking to move the case to a Federal Court). On October 5, Federal Judge Stafford made a final ruling to block the requested documents.
On June 27, 2018, the Travelers Indemnity Company and The Phoenix Insurance Company submitted an 18-page complaint for declaratory relief in U.S. District Court for Florida Southern District, Miami Division. The lawsuit filing seeks to avoid financial liability to the claimants and included the following statement: "There is no coverage under Travelers' and Phoenix's policies issued to Figg for any damages caused by the joint venture and/or partnership between Figg and MCM, as such joint venture and/or partnership was never disclosed to Travelers and Phoenix and does not qualify as an insured under either of the Policies issued to Figg."
The following is from a September 18, 2018 OSHA News Release — Region 4: The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on Friday, September 14, cited multiple contractors for safety violations after one employee suffered fatal injuries and five other employees sustained serious injuries when a pedestrian bridge at the Florida International University campus in Miami collapsed. The five companies collectively received seven violations, totaling $86,658 in proposed penalties. OSHA cited Figg Bridge Engineers Inc., a civil and structural engineering company; Network Engineering Services Inc. (doing business as Bolton Perez &amp; Assoc.), a construction engineering and inspection firm; Structural Technologies LLC (doing business as Structural Technologies/VSL), specializing in post-tensioning in bridges and buildings; Munilla Construction Management LLC, a bridge and building construction company; and The Structural Group of South Florida Inc., a contractor specializing in concrete formwork.
A total of 18 civil lawsuits were filed against 25 businesses connected to the failed FIU bridge project. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jennifer Bailey is overseeing the on-going case.
On March 1, 2019, Munilla Construction Management, the main Miami-based contractor behind the pedestrian bridge construction, announced a restructuring and recapitalization of the company through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition plan of reorganization. The company reached a settlement deal with the victims and their families on May 2, 2019, that would pay up to $42 million.
Replacement bridge.
On May 6, 2020, FDOT announced plans to design and rebuild the bridge, with guidance from the NTSB. The design stage is scheduled to begin in 2021 and last for two years, with a further two years estimated to construct the bridge.

Harold Strauss

Harold Strauss (1907–1975) was editor-in-chief of Alfred A. Knopf Inc. from 1942 until 1966. He is credited as introducing postwar Japanese fiction to American audiences with Jirō Osaragi's "Homecoming" and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's "Some Prefer Nettles" in 1955. He was also integral in introducing works by other Japanese authors like Kōbō Abe, Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata. With his wife Mildred, he is the namesake of the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Strauss Living Award.
Work in Publishing.
In 1928, Strauss began working for Alfred H. King, Inc. then Covici-Friede (where he argued for publication of John Steinbeck's "In Dubious Battle") until it went out of business in 1937. While stationed in Japan after World War II, Strauss reported on trends in Japanese print media. After the war, his introduction of Japanese literature to American audiences was part of a larger cultural exchange in order to protect American interests in Asia during the Cold War and aftermath of the Korean War.
Strauss Living Award.
Granted through the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Strauss Living Award (founded in 1981) provides two living writers with $100,000 a year for two years.

<doc id="56848750" url="?curid=56848750" title="Ładoś Group">
Ładoś Group

Ładoś Group, Bernese Group ( or "grupa Ładosia", ) is a name given to a group of Polish diplomats and Jewish activists who during Second World War elaborated in Switzerland a system of illegal production of Latin American passports aimed at saving European Jews from the Holocaust.
Composition of the group.
The group consisted of four diplomats from the Polish Legation in Bern, a representative of the RELICO Assistance Committee for the Jewish Victims of the War established by the World Jewish Congress and a representative of Agudat Israel. Five out of six members had Polish citizenship, while half of them were Jewish.
The members of the Ładoś Group were:
The Ładoś Group had a semi-informal structure and connections between its members were asymmetrical. It was Konstanty Rokicki who was most involved in acquiring blank passports and filling them out; Abraham Silberschein and Chaim Yisroel Eiss and Alfred Schwarzbaum (a Jewish rescue activist refugee from Bedzin) dealt with smuggling of passports, photos and personal data between Bern and German-occupied Europe, and provided a significant part of the financing of the operation. The role of Aleksander Ładoś and Stefan Ryniewicz was to ensure a diplomatic cover-up among the Bernese diplomatic corps and prevent Swiss authorities from breaking up the operation. Both Ładoś and Ryniewicz intervened in this case in 1943, and exchanged arguments with Swiss foreign minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz and the police chief Heinrich Rothmund. Juliusz Kühl, who at the outbreak of the war was a 26-year-old graduate of doctoral studies at the University of Bern, facilitated contacts between Jewish organizations and the Legation. In later years he was also nominated as the deputy head of the consular division. He probably also dealt with illegal transport of blank passports.
Historical background.
In September 1939, Poland was attacked by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and divided into two occupation zones. Nearly 36 million Polish citizens, including over 3 million Jews, were subjected to German and Soviet rule. At the same time, the Polish government refused to surrender and on September 17, 1939 crossed the border with Romania, where was interned. In accordance with the constitution of 1935, President Ignacy Mościcki appointed Władysław Raczkiewicz as his successor. Also, a new Polish government-in-exile was formed in Paris and began to rebuild the armed forces in France. The government, headed now by general Władysław Sikorski, took control of the entire property of the Polish State abroad, including the network of its diplomatic missions. After the German invasion of France the government moved to London, from where it continued to fight the Germans. In the continental part of Western Europe, the Polish government-in-exile was represented by the legations in Switzerland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. Other countries either came under German occupation or, under the pressure of the Germans, closed Polish diplomatic missions. In Switzerland Bern the Legation was located at Elfenstrasse in the diplomatic district of Kirchenfeld. Additionally, since 1940 another building housing a Consular Section, at Thunstrasse, was rented. Since April 1940, the Legation was headed by Aleksander Ładoś, a pre-war envoy to Latvia (1923–26) and a consul general in Munich (1927–31). Ładoś left Poland after invasion and served briefly as a member of Władysław Sikorski's government. When he took up the post in Bern, the other three diplomats – already worked there: Ryniewicz from 1938, and Kühl and Rokicki from 1939. Rokicki and Ryniewicz knew each other from their previous post in Riga (1934–36) and were probably close friends. Only in Bern they met Kühl and Ładoś. Abraham Silberschein, who was supposed to be the delegate for the 21 Zionist Congress, came to Geneva from Lviv shortly before the outbreak of the war. Chaim Yisroel Eiss had been staying in Switzerland since the beginning of the 20th century and had a store in Zurich. Both representatives of Jewish organizations did not know each other before the war and were politically very distant.
Genesis and production model of passports.
According to Juliusz Kühl, an idea of producing false passports was invented at the eve of 1940 and had no connection with the Holocaust. Several dozen of Paraguayan documents were produced with a view of enabling influential Jews from the areas occupied by the Soviet Union an escape through Japan. The legation identified an honorary consul of Paraguay, a Bernese notary Rudolf Hügli, who was ready to sell blank passports and bought about 30 of them. It is not known who filled them and how they were sent to the Soviet Union. Initially, it was assumed that such activities could be carried individually, since the scheme could be revealed. However, in later years production of similar documents continued. The most known example is the passport obtained by Eli Sternbuch for his future wife Guta Eisenzweig and her mother in November 1941. The Sternbuch family obtained it by contacting Juliusz Kühl. It is not known who filled out this document. 1957 Yad Vashem's study suggests there were more passports – in particular in 1941 during the German invasion of the Soviet Union and after the creation of Jewish ghettos. In some cases bearers of such documents were released from the obligation to live in ghettos and wear a band with the Star of David. The production of passport on a mass scale begun in 1942, after Wannsee Conference, when the mass murder of European Jews was decided. From that moment, passports of Latin American countries protected from deportation to Nazi Germany Extermination camp, as their holders were sent to internment camps in Germany and occupied France. Initially, the operation was carried out chaotically, which increased the possibility of setback. This was the reason why the Legation reached out to Abraham Silberschein in 1942.
Investigated by the police, Silberchein described it as follows: "I had a meeting at the Polish Legation in Bern with Mr I secretary Ryniewicz and Mr. Rokicki, who manages the consular section. Both gentlemen drew my attention to the fact that some people in Switzerland deal with providing passports of Latin American countries of for Poles in countries occupied by Germany. These passports enable their holders to improve their situation. We were having a real "black market" of passports. The gentlemen from the Legation expressed their desire that I would take responsibility for this matter, which I also did on behalf of RELICO".
Passports of Paraguay.
It was RELICO-Legation axis which constituted core of the scheme. Silberschein would send lists of people foreseen to become passport holders to Rokicki who would record them and had Paraguay's passports fabricated. A typical exchange of correspondence between Silberschein and Rokicki in 1942 and 1943 includes a letter from Silberschein with the list of persons to whom the documents were to be granted. Rokicki sent Silberschein in turn filled passports or their copies certified by a notary public and a letter from consul Rudolf Hügli in which holders of the passports were informed that they had received a Paraguayan citizenship. Apart from that, many separate confirmations of Paraguay's citizenship were issued. The lists of recipients of such documents contains several thousand names. At first glance it seems that the vast majority of Paraguay passports were issued between 18 and 30 December 1942 and none of them was filled in 1943. However, the correspondence between Silberschein and Rokicki available in the archives of Yad Vashem indicates that these passports were backdated (there is an evidence that several passports of 30 December 1942 were issued in the autumn of 1943). The vast majority of Paraguay's passports has the traces of handwriting of Konstanty Rokicki, but there are also several passports filled with a different character. The most probable version is that they are filled either by Juliusz Kühl or Stefan Ryniewicz, himself an experienced consul. Passports were issued for Jewish citizens of Poland, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Hungary as well as for Jews deprived of their Germany citizenship. The ordinal numbers of passports found in the Silberschein archives in Yad Vashem suggest that at least three series of these documents had been produced, tallying altogether to least 1056 pieces. In many cases there are more than one or two people mentioned in the passports. It may be easily assessed that at least 2,100 people were beneficiaries of these documents. Each passport cost between 500 and 2,000 Swiss francs. The money was transferred to Rudolf Hügli by Polish diplomats – Rokicki, Kühl and Ryniewicz – and brought him enormous income. By comparison, the then monthly salary of Aleksander Ładoś equaled to 1,800 francs, and this of Juliusz Kühl – to 350 francs.
Passports of Peru and El Salvador.
In 1943 Silberschein established contact with the consul of Peru in Geneva, José Barreto. Baretto handed to Silberschein 28 passports for 10–12 thousand francs. The General Consul of Peru, who was informed about this maneuver, dismissed Barreto. In this case, an argument erupted between Silberschein and Ryniewicz, who accused former of acting on his own hand and giving the matter a resemblance of conspiracy. From this correspondence, it appears that the Polish Legation demanded full information on the action. Ryniewicz also took successful intervention to save Barreto and cover up the case and inspired similar action by the Polish Legation in Lima. In 1943, Silberschein established contact with a Jewish employee of the General Consulate of El Salvador in Geneva, George Mandel-Mantello. Mantello – most probably with the consent of his consul – Arturo Castellanos, handed him completed passports and citizenship certificates. The Polish legation was probably informed about the number of issued passports and about contacts between Silberschein-Mantello, but there is no evidence that it participated in the production of documents. Arturo Castellanos was declared in 2010 by Yad Vashem the Righteous Among the Nations.
Passports of Honduras, Haiti and other countries.
In case of passports of Honduras Silberschein contacted directly with Anton Bauer, the former Honorary Consul of Honduras, who stole the seal and issued the documents illegally at his office in Bern. The recipient of Silberschein's letters was Bauer's daughter – Isabella. In one case, however, one can see traces of obtaining passports through Rokicki. On May 27, 1943, Silberschein asked him to organize a series of passports for the next day and at least two Honduran passports were issued shortly thereafter.
Outcome of the rescue efforts.
In January 1944 Silberschein reported that thanks to the action about 10 thousand people were saved from being sent to German extermination camps. According to him bearers of the Latin American passports were placed in internment camps in Tittmoning, Liebenau and Bölsenberg in Germany and in the Vittel camp in France. In March 1944, the Germans liquidated the latter, murdering from 200 to 300 prisoners, but those staying in other places were mostly spared. One of the documents from Silberschein's archive estimates that shortly before the liberation of Bergen-Belsen sub-camp there were over 1,100 holders of passports. Silberschein also wrote that he had met many of them met during his visit to Poland in May 1946.
In December 2019 list of names of 3262 holders of passports issued by Ładoś Group was presented at the Pilecki Institute in Warsaw. It is estimated though that from 5000 to 7000 names of the passports' bearers remains unknown. The research has been carried out by team led by Jakub Kumoch in Arolsen Archives - International Center on Nazi Persecution, Yad Vashem, and Archives of New Proceedings in Warsaw.
Ładoś Group in literature.
The majority of studies gives the credit of saving Jews to single members of the group. This is due to the fact that the group was acting in conspiracy and due to the lack of holistic memories written by any of its members. Aleksander Ładoś announced the description of the rescue action in the third, unfinished volume of memories, but he died without having written the story. Diplomats from the Ładoś Group – Ładoś, Rokicki, Kühl and Ryniewicz – were named in the letter of thanks from Agudat Israel from January 1945. In 2015 Agnieszka Haska published an article about saving Jews by the Polish diplomats in Bern. In August 2017 Markus Blechner, the Honorary Consul of Poland in Zürich, together with journalists Zbigniew Parafianowicz and Michał Potocki described the scheme, recognizing the contribution of all group members to the survival of passport holders. The matter of Latin American Passports was the subject of a poem by Władysław Szlengel, a Polish-Jewish poet, an author of the poem "Passports", written in the Warsaw Ghetto.
Eiss Archive.
A number of documents related to the Ładoś Group were acquired by the Polish Ministry of Culture, with the assistance of Honorary Consul Markus Blechner, from a private collector in Israel in 2018. Named the Eiss Archive, they were displayed in the Polish embassy in Switzerland in January 2019, and later were transferred to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in Poland.
Yad Vashem Controversy.
In April 2019 the Yad Vashem's Righteous Among The Nations granted the title to Konstanty Rokicki and offered "appreciation" to Aleksander Ładoś and Stefan Ryniewicz arguing that Rokicki headed the Ładoś Group. The document erroneously called Ładoś and Ryniewicz "consuls". The decision sparked outrage and frustration among the family members of the two other late Polish diplomats, and among survivors. Thirty one of them signed an open letter to Yad Vashem. Rokicki's cousin refused to accept the medal until two other Polish diplomats, Rokicki's superior are recognized as Righteous Among The Nations, too. Polish Ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch who contributed to the discovery of Rokicki also refuted the Yad Vashem's interpretation stating that Rokicki worked under Ładoś and Ryniewicz.

Dispersive flies optimisation

Dispersive flies optimisation (DFO) is a bare-bones swarm intelligence algorithm which is inspired by the swarming behaviour of flies hovering over food sources. DFO is a simple optimiser which works by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a numerical measure that is calculated by a fitness function. Each member of the population, a fly or an agent, holds a candidate solution whose suitability can be evaluated by their fitness value. Optimisation problems are often formulated as either minimisation or maximisation problems.
DFO was introduced with the intention of analysing a simplified swarm intelligence algorithm with the fewest tunable parameters and components. In the first work on DFO, this algorithm was compared against a few other existing swarm intelligence techniques using error, efficiency and diversity measures. It is shown that despite the simplicity of the algorithm, which only uses agents’ position vectors at time "t" to generate the position vectors for time "t" + 1, it exhibits a competitive performance. Since its inception, DFO has been used in a variety of applications including medical imaging and image analysis as well as data mining and machine learning.
Algorithm.
DFO bears many similarities with other existing continuous, population-based optimisers (e.g. particle swarm optimization and differential evolution). In that, the swarming behaviour of the individuals consists of two tightly connected mechanisms, one is the formation of the swarm and the other is its breaking or weakening. DFO works by facilitating the information exchange between the members of the population (the swarming flies). Each fly formula_1 represents a position in a "d"-dimensional search space: formula_2, and the fitness of each fly is calculated by the fitness function formula_3, which takes into account the flies' "d" dimensions: formula_4.
The pseudocode below represents one iteration of the algorithm:
 for i = 1 : N flies
 formula_5
 end for i 
 formula_6 = arg min formula_7
 for i = 1 : N and formula_8
 for d = 1 : D dimensions
 formula_9
 else
 formula_10
 end if 
 end for d
 end for i 
In the algorithm above, formula_11 represents fly formula_12 at dimension formula_13 and time formula_14; formula_15 presents formula_16's best neighbouring fly in ring topology (left or right, using flies indexes), at dimension formula_13 and time formula_18; and formula_19 is the swarm's best fly. Using this update equation, the swarm's population update depends on each fly's best neighbour (which is used as the focus formula_20, and the difference between the current fly and the best in swarm represents the spread of movement, formula_21).
Other than the population size formula_22, the only tunable parameter is the disturbance threshold formula_23, which controls the dimension-wise restart in each fly vector. This mechanism is proposed to control the diversity of the swarm.
Other notable minimalist swarm algorithm is Bare bones particle swarms (BB-PSO), which is based on particle swarm optimisation, along with bare bones differential evolution (BBDE) which is a hybrid of the bare bones particle swarm optimiser and differential evolution, aiming to reduce the number of parameters. Alhakbani in her PhD thesis covers many aspects of the algorithms including several DFO applications in feature selection as well as parameter tuning.
Applications.
Some of the recent applications of DFO are listed below:

Chelsea station (MBTA)

Chelsea is an MBTA Silver Line bus rapid transit station in Chelsea, Massachusetts. It opened on April 21, 2018, as the terminus of the new SL3 route. An adjacent MBTA Commuter Rail station will open in 2021.
History.
B&amp;M station.
The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) had its East Everett station at 2nd Street, serving residential areas to the southeast. The station was built by property owners and opened in 1880. Streetcars cut heavily into the profitability of local commuter rail service; the B&amp;M closed the station building in 1932, though some trains continued to stop. The building was demolished around 1933. By 1946, the station was served by only one weekday-only round trip. By the time the remaining local stops on the line south of Lynn were closed in 1958, East Everett was no longer being served. The residential neighborhood around 2nd Street, already planned for urban renewal, was destroyed by the Great Chelsea fire of 1973; it was replaced by industry and the Mystic Mall.
MBTA Silver Line station.
Mystic Mall was a proposed stop on the Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a circumferential bus rapid transit (BRT) line designed to connect the current radial MBTA rail lines, to reduce overcrowding in the downtown stations. Under draft plans released in 2008, buses would have left the dedicated busway (constructed next to existing commuter rail tracks) to access new surface-level BRT platforms on Everett Street and Spruce Street. Although the full project was shelved in 2010 due to the MBTA's financial difficulties, some corridor routes are receiving more limited work.
In March 2013, the MBTA began studying an extension of the Silver Line to Chelsea via a newly constructed bypass road in East Boston. Three alternatives were discussed for the Chelsea section. One would run up the abandoned section of the Grand Junction Railroad right-of-way from Eastern Avenue to Chelsea station with stops at Eastern Avenue, Highland/Box District, Chelsea station, and Mystic Mall. The second alignment would follow the Grand Junction to just short of Bellingham Square, then diverge onto surface roads to Bellingham Square. The third alignment would run entirely on surface streets, serving two stops on Central Avenue and four stops along a loop serving the existing Chelsea station and the MGH Chelsea healthcare center. In September 2013, the MBTA indicated that it would pursue the first alternative despite potential issues with bridge clearances and rebuilding Chelsea station.
On October 30, 2013, MassDOT announced $82.5 million in state funding for a modified version of the first alternative to be constructed. A new $20 million Chelsea commuter rail station would be constructed at the Mystic Mall busway terminus to replace the existing station. This new station would make the commuter rail station fully accessible, with longer platforms so that trains would not block grade crossings while stopped. The Silver Line would have a new Bellingham Square stop at the old commuter rail station location. Service was expected to begin in late 2015.
A construction contract was approved in September 2014, and construction began in March 2015. By June 2017, opening had been pushed back to April 2018. Silver Line service on the SL3 branch began on April 21, 2018. 
Commuter rail station.
The MBTA opened bidding for the contract to construct the new commuter rail station (which also includes installation of several nearby traffic signals and demolition of the existing station) in February 2019, with an expected cost of $26.7 million. A $32.4 million contract was awarded in April 2019, with completion then expected in late 2021. Construction of the project (which has a total cost of $37.7 million) began in August 2019. The supports for the outbound platform were completed by April 2020, and the platforms were installed that August. , the new station is expected to open in September 2021. The station reached 70% completion in March 2021.

Rick Butler sexual abuse allegations

Rick Butler is a prominent youth volleyball coach and the founder of Sports Performance Volleyball Club in Aurora, Illinois. Butler has been accused of having had sexual relationships with underage female players in his club in the 1980s. Butler has denied any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime.
Background.
Rick Butler was the head coach of the Chicago Breeze in Major League Volleyball. He started the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in 1981. The club has since won almost 100 national championships.
Sexual abuse allegations.
In 1995, Butler was accused of having had sexual relationships with three of his underage female players in the 1980s. The three accusers publicly came forward and detailed how Butler allegedly raped them when they were underage and he was their coach. An investigation by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services found "credible evidence" that the accusations were true. Butler acknowledged having sexual relations with the three players, but alleges the relationships were consensual and only occurred after the players were 18 or older. The DuPage County sheriff's office did not press charges because the statute of limitations had already expired. Butler has never faced any criminal charges and has stated that these allegations are "an orchestrated campaign" to damage his reputation.
2018 lawsuit.
In March 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Butler and his wife by a mother of an athlete who trained at the Sports Performance Volleyball Club in 2012. The lawsuit alleges that the Butlers deceived parents and players into joining the club "based upon false information and material omissions" regarding the accusations of "sexual abuse of underage girls" by Rick Butler.
Reactions.
USA Volleyball.
Butler was initially banned by a USA Volleyball ethics panel from coaching girls in August 1995, but the ban was partially lifted in 2000 and Butler returned to coaching. Following a hearing by an ethics committee, Butler was banned for life by USA Volleyball in January 2018. Butler refused to participate in the hearing, calling it a "sham".
Amateur Athletic Union.
In July 2015, following an "Outside the Lines" report on the previous allegations against him, Butler stepped down from his role as Illinois district director of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and the AAU announced that it would conduct a review of its child-protection policies. In June 2016, the AAU was sued by one of Butler's accusers for allowing him to coach an under-18 team in the AAU Girls' Junior National Volleyball Championships. In February 2018, Butler was "permanently disqualified" from participating in AAU events.
Others.
Nancy Reno, who played for Butler's club, said in 1999 that she believed Butler's initial three accusers because they had confided in her and other teammates at the time. Said Reno, "We were in denial about it because we were scared."
On May 15, 2018, a hearing was held by the State Senate Task Force on Sexual Discrimination and Harassment Awareness and Prevention to hear the testimony of two former volleyball players who have accused Butler of sexual assault.
In an April 18, 2018 letter, ESPN Wide World of Sports announced that Butler was prohibited from participating in events held at their sport complex, including the AAU Girls' Junior National Volleyball Championships.

Ben Taub (born January 9, 1991) is an American journalist who is a staff writer for "The New Yorker" magazine. He has written for the magazine about a range of subjects related to jihadism, crime, conflict, and human rights, mostly in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.
Life.
Taub attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated with an A.B. in philosophy in 2014. In 2012, during a year off from Princeton, he was a contestant on "The Voice", on CeeLo Green's team. Six months later, he used the stipend from appearing on the show to fund his first trip to Kilis and the Turkish-Syrian border, to learn how to be a war correspondent. Taub's work in Kilis culminated in his 149-page long senior thesis, titled "Fools and Philosophy on the Fringe of War", completed under the supervision of Gideon Rosen.
In 2015, he graduated from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.
Awards.
In 2017, Taub's work on war crimes in Syria, which was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and published by The New Yorker in both English and Arabic, was short-listed for a National Magazine Award and won the Livingston Award for International Reporting, the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for International Print reporting, and the Overseas Press Club Award for Investigative Reporting. Taub also received the American Society of Magazine Editors Next Award for Journalists Under 30, and was named one of the Forbes 30 Under 30 in Media.
In 2018, his work on a convergence of crises in the Sahel won the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting and the Prince Albert II of Monaco and United Nations Correspondents Association Global Prize for coverage of Climate Change.
In 2019, his work on Iraq's post-ISIS campaign of revenge, which was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, won the National Magazine Award for Reporting and the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting, making him the eighth back-to-back Polk laureate, and the first in 20 years.

Left-right asymmetry (biology)

Left-right asymmetry (LR asymmetry) refers to differences in structure (symmetry breaking) across the mediolateral (left and right) plane in animals. This plane is defined with respect to the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes and is perpendicular to both. Because the left-right plane is not strictly an axis (as it is not established through a morphogen gradient), to create asymmetry, the left and right sides need to be patterned separately.
LR asymmetry is pervasive throughout metazoans and present throughout every major lineage. Notable examples include the large and small claws of the fiddler crab, the left offset of the vertebrate heart, asymmetrical gut coiling in "Drosophila melanogaster," and dextral (clockwise) and sinistral (counterclockwise) coiling of gastropods. This asymmetry can be restricted to a specific organ or feature, as in the crab claws, or be expressed throughout the entire body as in snails.
Developmental basis.
Components of the Nodal signaling pathway have been implicated in left-right determination in a diverse set of taxa. While the mechanisms to set up the left-right sides appear to differ markedly among groups of organisms, "Nodal" is consistently deployed in most of the lineages that have been examined (except for ecdysozoans). In established model organisms such as mouse, chick, "D. melanogaster," and "Xenopus," ongoing research has begun to focus on cellular level symmetry-breaking mechanisms (e.g. cytoskeletal chirality, ciliary flow) that may lead to differential expression of molecules such as Nodal.
Vertebrates.
"Nodal" was first described in the chick embryo, where genes "activin receptor IIa, Sonic hedgehog (Shh)," and "chick nodal-related 1 (cNR-1)" were found to be asymmetrically expressed across Hensen's node with "cnR-1" expressed on the left side. Misexpressing "Shh" or "activin receptor IIa" on the right side randomized heart asymmetry in the chick. This asymmetrical gene expression appears to be triggered by cell movements in the node.
In mouse, the left side is distinguished from the right through Nodal flow. Originally described from "inversus viscerum (iv)" and "inversion of embryonic turning (inv)" mouse mutants, which are characterized by a randomization of left-right phenotypes, Nodal flow refers to the movement of nodal cilia to create a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid. Carried in this leftward movement is Nodal, a signaling peptide from the TGF-β family necessary to pattern left-right determination. In the lateral plate mesoderm, Nodal then activates a positive feedback loop promoting its expression and its downstream effector "Pitx2." To prevent expansion to the rightward portion of the embryo, Nodal activates "Lefty1" and "Lefty2," which repress the Nodal signaling pathway by competing with Nodal binding sites.
Because Nodal flow through ciliary movement is not present in all vertebrates (e.g. the chick), asymmetric gene expression must be established in another way. One such idea posits that ion channels and pumps (H+/K+ ATPase) generate differences in voltage and pH across the mediolateral plane, thus providing gradients to orient signaling molecules.
Non-vertebrate deuterostomes.
Recently, work has shown that the Nodal-Pitx2 pathway is present and functional in the non-vertebrate deuterostomes (tunicates, sea urchins). In tunicate (ascidian) "Ciona intestinalis" and "Halocynthia roretzi", "Nodal" is expressed on the left side of the developing embryo and leads to downstream expression of "Pitx2." At earlier stages, similar H+/K+ ATPase ion channels are reported to be necessary for correct left-right patterning. While the role of cilia here is still unclear, one study observes that large-scale embryonic movements are required for left-right determination in "H. roretzi," and that this movement is possibly achieved through ciliary movements.
In the sea urchin, "Nodal" is expressed on the right side of the embryo, in contrast to the tunicate and vertebrate condition on the left side. Because protostomes appear to also express "Nodal" on their right side instead of the left (discussed below), some have suggested that this lends further evidence for the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis.
Protostomes.
Ecdysozoa.
While "D. melanogaster" and nematode "Caenorhabditis elegans" do show left-right asymmetry, the Nodal signaling pathway itself is absent in Ecdysozoa. Instead, cytoskeletal regulators such as Myo31DF, a type ID unconventional myosin, have been found to control left-right asymmetry in organ systems such as genitalia.
Lophotrochozoa.
Unlike in Ecdysozoa, the Nodal-Pitx2 pathways have been identified in many lineages within the Lophotrochozoans. When found in brachiopods and molluscs, these genes are asymmetrically expressed on the right. Platyhelminthes, annelids, and nermeteans lack a Nodal orthologue and instead only express Pitx2, which was expressed in association to the nervous system.
Whole body left-right asymmetry in gastropods.
Whole body inversion is observed as chiral (dextral, sinistral) coiling in gastropods. While dextral coiling is the most common as it appears in 90-99% of living species, sinistral species still have arisen many times.
Developmental basis of shell coiling.
Gastropods undergo spiral cleavage, a feature commonly seen in lophotrochozoans. As the embryo divides, quartets of cells are oriented at angles to each other. In the snail "Lymnaea stagnalis", the direction of rotation during the first cell division signals whether the adult will show dextral or sinistral coiling, At the third cleavage (8-cell stage), spindles in dextral snails are inclined clockwise whereas they are counterclockwise in sinistral snails. Furthermore, injecting "L. peregra" sinistral eggs with the cytoplasm of dextral eggs before the second polar body formation will reverse the polarity of the sinistral embryos. These data show that chirality is heritable and maternally deposited in "Lymnaea".
Several studies have begun to investigate the molecular basis of this inheritance. "Nodal" and "Pitx2" are expressed on different sides of the "L. stagnalis" embryo depending on its chirality – right for dextral, left for sinistral. Downstream of "Nodal, decapentaplegic (dpp)," shows the same expression pattern. In limpets (gastropods without coiled shells) "dpp" is expressed symmetrically in "Patella vulgata" and "Nipponacmea fuscoviridis". Additionally, in "N. fuscoviridis", "dpp" has been shown to drive cell proliferation
Upstream of Nodal, "Lsdia1/2" have been implicated in controlling "L. stagnalis" chirality. Davison et al. (2016) mapped the “chirality locus” to a 0.4 Mb region and determined that "Lsdia2" is the likely candidate for determining dextral or sinistral coiling. This is a diaphanous-related formin gene involved in cytoskeleton formation. Dextral embryos treated with drugs that inhibited formin activity phenocopied the sinistral condition. Concurrent work from Kuroda et al. (2016) identified the same "Lsdia2" gene (called "Lsdia1" in their study) but failed to reproduce the formin inhibition results in the Davison et al. study. Additionally, Kuroda et al. (2016) did not find asymmetrically expressed "Lsdia2" as was seen in the Davison et al. (2016) study.

Billy Smith (footballer, born 1906)

William Henry Smith (9 June 1906 – 1983) was an English footballer who played as a full-back in the Football League for South Shields, Portsmouth and Stockport County.
Smith, who played in either full-back position, spent the majority of his career at Portsmouth, having previously played League football for South Shields. After joining Portsmouth in 1928, he made 311 League appearances, and played in the 1934 FA Cup Final side that lost to Manchester City in April 1934.
After leaving Portsmouth in 1937, he joined Stockport County, where he played 36 times in four seasons (although his two appearances in 1939–40 were subsequently struck from the record as League football was abandoned due to the outbreak of World War II).
Four of his six brothers were also footballers. Jack also played for South Shields and Portsmouth and the two played together in the 1934 Cup Final. Younger brother Sep played for Leicester City, and played against his brothers in the semi-final of the competition. Tom played for South Shields and later played for Manchester United and Northampton Town. Joe played reserve football for Leicester and later played for Watford.

Native American Women Playwrights Archive

The Native American Women Playwrights Archive (NAWPA) is a collection of manuscripts and related items pertaining to Native American women in theater. It was established in 1997 at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and is located in the university's King Library. The archive is a repository for Spiderwoman Theater and contains promotional and personal documents associated with the theater troupe and its members.
History.
NAWPA began in 1996 with Dr. William Wortman, humanities librarian, and John Allen Johnson, a Cherokee and African American graduate student researching Native American women playwrights at Miami University. Johnson had difficulty finding material to research, so the two built the archive by approaching writers and performers to add to the collection.
Holdings.
The Native American Women Playwrights Archive in the King Library's Walter Havighurst Special Collections of Miami University contains play manuscripts and other materials including audio and video recordings of performances (VHS tapes, audio cassettes, CDs, and DVDs), photographs, newspaper articles, reviews, flyers, and posters. The archive also holds administrative and financial documents, notes, forms, mailings lists, and correspondence pertaining to the management of the archive and sponsored conferences and events.
Other holdings include documents relating to the work of Spiderwoman Theater, such as photographs of performances, play programs, interviews, and personal accounts from the members of the theater troupe. There are also documents regarding the legal dispute with Marvel Comics over the name "Spiderwoman."
All the materials in NAWPA are open-access and available for anyone to read in the library. NAWPA continuously adds new playwrights and works to its collection. The archive encourages "playwrights at any level of development" to submit their materials.
Publications.
In 2008, University of Michigan Press published "Footpaths and Bridges: Voices from the Native American Women Playwrights Archive", edited by Shirley A. Huston-Findley and Rebecca Howard. The anthology includes a number of scripts from NAWPA and critical commentary on the recurring themes in the plays. Other related publications include:

WLJZ-LP (107.1 FM) is a low-power radio station. Licensed to Salisbury, North Carolina, United States, the station is owned by Livingstone College. The station was "deemed operational" December 7, 2017 but officially launched in February 2018. Programming includes information and discussions related to the college, community and music that includes jazz, Afro-Cuban, hip-hop, R&amp;B fusion and gospel. Students work at the station, whose studios are in the W.J. Walls Center, and a major in communications is planned which would use the station.
College president Jimmy Jenkins was inspired to start WLJZ by his experience with helping start a station at Elizabeth City State University. Artists played on WLJZ include Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and The Supremes. Students contribute a lot of the programming, but WLJZ will remain on the air during the summer. In the future, sponsors may help to fund the station. One plan is to have professors at the college explain music as they play it. Although the signal only covers Salisbury, a new tower is planned that will provide more coverage to Rowan County.

Small Great Things

Small Great Things (2016) is the twenty-fifth novel by the American author, Jodi Picoult. The book focuses on race in America and revolves around the protagonist, a delivery nurse, named Ruth Jefferson. "Small Great Things" is being adapted into a film starring Viola Davis and Julia Roberts. This is Picoult's first novel with an African American protagonist.
Synopsis.
The story concentrates on an African-American labor/delivery (L&amp;D) nurse, Ruth Jefferson, in charge of newborns at a Connecticut hospital. Ruth is ordered not to touch or go near the baby of a white supremacist couple. After the baby dies in her care, Ruth is charged with murder, and taken to court. 
Narrative style.
The story is told from the complex multiple racial perspectives of the principal characters, including the nurse, Ruth, Turk Bauer, the white supremacist father of the baby, and Kennedy McQuarrie, Ruth's attorney. Picoult frequently employs an alternating multi-perspective narrative style in her novels, including "My Sister's Keeper, Songs of the Humpback Whale, Sing You Home, Handle With Care, Change of Heart, Lone Wolf," and "The Storyteller."
Critical reception.
The novel has received positive and mixed reviews. Eleanor Brown of "The Washington Post" wrote that, "'Small Great Things' is the most important novel Jodi Picoult has ever written. Frank, uncomfortably introspective and right on the day’s headlines, it will challenge her readers", although she felt that the book is "overly long, with a meandering middle, a tendency toward melodrama and a rushed ending that feels glib." Whereas, Roxane Gay, writing for the "New York Times" thought Turk, the white supremacist character, was well-written; though also found that the protagonist and African American character, Ruth, to be the least believable: "The more we see of Ruth and her family, the more their characterization feels like black-people bingo — as if Picoult is working through a checklist of issues in an attempt to say everything about race in one book." Gay found it a "flawed novel" but felt "generous" toward the book and gave her "a lot of credit for trying, and for supporting her attempt with rigorous research, good intentions and an awareness of her fallibility". Gay further wrote: "The novel is messy, but so is our racial climate."

Megalorchestia californiana

Megalorchestia californiana is a species of sand-hopper in the family Talitridae. It was first described in 1851 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt and is the type species of the genus "Megalorchestia". It is commonly known as the long-horned beach hopper.
Distribution and habitat.
"M. californiana" is native to the west coast of North America where its range extends from Vancouver Island in British Columbia to Laguna Beach, California. It is found on slightly sloping sandy beaches and retreats far up the beach, in contrast to the short-horned beach hopper ("Megalorchestia corniculata") which is found on steeply sloping sandy shores and does not occur so high up the beach.
Ecology.
"M. californiana" tends to hide in a shallow burrow or under heaps of dead seaweed during the day, emerging at night or in dull weather to feed on decaying seaweed or organic debris left behind by beach-goers. Just before dawn the beach hoppers retreat under the sand and can sometimes be seen fighting each other for possession of an existing burrow in preference to digging a new one.

It is named after the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Maurice Schumann (not to be confused with Robert Schuman, one of the founders of the EU, the Council of Europe and NATO).
Background.
In May 1967, the leaders of the six founding EC Member States ('the Six') convened at an EC summit in Rome, which was overshadowed by growing tensions in the Middle East. Even though several leaders felt that the events necessitated a common response, the Six failed to even reach agreement as to how to proceed with discussions on the matter. While Germany was in favor of debating the situation at the summit, France favoured a four-power summit consisting of the UK, the USA, the Soviet Union, and themselves. When the crisis escalated into the Six-Day War shortly after the summit, the national responses differed considerably.
Creation of the document.
The EC's failure to deliver coordinated action in the midst of a major international crisis like the Six-Day War was an embarrassment to the Europeans. Economic integration had transformed the EC into a formidable economic power - yet its economic weight stood in sharp contrast to its political sway.
The inability to speak with one voice in the days leading up to the Six-Day War and its aftermath together with the resignation of Charles de Gaulle in April 1969 led the EC to develop a new instrument for foreign policy coordination. The EPC was introduced in The Hague summit of December 1969 and placed the Middle East high on its agenda. This led to the drafting of the so-called Schumann document two years later.
Content.
The document outlined six principles:
Reception.
When its contents were leaked to the German press it was contested what the status of the document was. France claimed it represented the official policy of the Community while Germany and the Netherlands maintained it was no more than a working paper that had been prepared for discussion.

Marshall Orme Wilson

Marshall Orme Wilson (June 20, 1860 – April 1, 1926) was an American banker and prominent member of New York Society during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Wilson was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on June 20, 1860. He was the eldest surviving son born to Richard Thornton Wilson Sr. and Melissa Clementine Johnston. His father was a multimillionaire investment banker originally from Loudon, Tennessee who served on the staff of Lucius B. Northrop, the Commissary-General of the Confederate States of America and invested in railways following the end of the War. His parents resided at 511 Fifth Avenue, the former home of Boss Tweed.
Because of Wilson and his siblings' many advantageous marriages, the Wilsons were known in New York and Newport society as the "Marrying Wilsons." His sister Grace Graham Wilson married Cornelius "Neily" Vanderbilt III of the Vanderbilt family. His brother, Richard Thornton Wilson Jr., was married to Marion Steedman Mason (1875–1947). Wilson's other two sisters, Belle Wilson, was married to the Honourable Sir Michael Henry Herbert, the British Ambassador to the United States during Theodore Roosevelt's administration and the brother of the Earl of Pembroke, and Mary Wilson, who was married to New York real estate heir, Ogden Goelet, and were the parents of Wilson's niece, Mary Goelet, who married the Duke of Roxburghe.
Career.
In 1882, Wilson graduated from Columbia University. Upon his graduation, he joined his father's firm, R. T. Wilson &amp; Co. as a banker.
Along with his wife, a daughter of New York Society leader Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, Wilson was considered a social leader in both New York and Newport, Rhode Island. He was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Church, and the Automobile of America. In 1894, Wilson was painted by Léon Bonnat, in a work now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Personal life.
In the early 1880s, Wilson met and fell in love with Caroline Schermerhorn "Carrie" Astor and they endeavored to marry. As he was a son of a Southerner and Civil War profiteer, the Astors disapproved of the prospect. Reportedly, Carrie "starved herself into bulimia until her mother gave in and agreed to the marriage."
On November 18, 1884, the couple wed at the Astor mansion. Carrie, a great-granddaughter of John Jacob Astor, was the youngest daughter of William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, leader of the 400. Among her siblings was brother Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, who died aboard the "RMS Titanic". Together, Orme and Carrie had two sons; Marshall Orme Wilson Jr. in 1885—who was appointed United States Ambassador to Haiti by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944—and Richard Thornton Wilson III in 1886.
Wilson died on April 1, 1926, in New York City. His funeral service was held at the Trinity Chapel on 25th Street and was officiated by Bishop William T. Manning where the choir of Trinity Church sang the hymns "Nearer, My God, to Thee." He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. In his will, his wife received their residence and all of its belongings, and his sons inherited the residual estate, including the funds left by his father in trust for his sons, thereby avoiding Federal or State inheritance tax on the principal.
Residences.
After his marriage to Carrie, the couple moved into a new home at 414 Fifth Avenue purchased by her father for them as a wedding present and furnished by his father.
Following his mother-in-law and brother-in-law's feud with Carrie's cousin William Waldorf Astor, Wilson hired the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore to design a residence on East 64th Street. The house, which began construction in 1900 was completed in 1903, was in close proximity of other Astor family residences, including Mrs. Astor's home designed by Richard Morris Hunt around the corner on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 65th Street. The residence had a Beaux Arts facade of Indiana Limestone and a mansard roof of blue slate and is five stories tall, sixty-five feet wide consisting of five bays, and featured a circular atrium.

Onychoteuthis bergii is a species of hooked squid from the family Onychoteuthidae, it was originally described by Hinrich Lichtenstein from speciemsn taken near the Cape of Good Hope and is the type species of the genus "Onychoteuthis". Until recently it was considered to be a junior synonym of "Onychoteuthis banksii", but a re-examination of the type material, the lectotype and paralectotype which are deposited in the Natural History Museum, Berlin, showed that there were morphological differences which supported the status of "O. bergii" as a valid species. The species is found in the eastern South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

Louis Bouwmeester

Louis Frederik Johannes Bouwmeester (5 September 1842 – 28 April 1925) was a Dutch actor best known for his Shakespeare interpretations. He is also known as Louis Bouwmeester Sr. for distinction from his son.
He performed several times in Vienna, London and Paris, and became popular. From 1873 to 1879 he was director of the Salon des Variétés in Amsterdam. In 1882 he received from Willem III the gold medal for Arts and Sciences. In 1902 he became director of the Haarlems Theater Company. He was strong actor in melodramas such as "De twee wezen" (The Two Orphans).
Nico de Jong gave a short speech following the death of Louis Bouwmeester. He called Bouwmeester "the friend of the Dutch theater players, an artist by God's grace, whose name will be mentioned after centuries". After his speech he asked the attendees to stand up for a moment in reverence for the deceased and to agree with him in his wish: "Louis Bouwmeester, rest in peace". The actor's death was discussed in various theaters in the Netherlands. His career was described as "extraordinary for triumph and for variety".
The stage award, the Louis d'Or, which has been awarded to the best male supporting role since 1955, was named after Bouwmeester.
Louis Bouwmeester was buried at the Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam. His tomb was damaged by the end of the 20th century, a new monument was erected in the image of the old.

Mary Ramsden (born 1984) is a British painter, who lives and works in London. Her work has been compared to Cy Twombly, with abstract gestural movements on the canvas.
Biography.
Ramsden studied art at Leith School of Art (LSA) and Edinburgh College of Art. She continued her education and graduated in 2013 from the three-year postgraduate art school at the Royal Academy of Arts, RA, in London, studying with artists Richard Kirwan, Brian Griffiths and Vanessa Jackson. While still at the RA Ramsden's first solo gallery show was held in 2012 at Pilar Corrias and a second was held there in January 2015.
In 2016–2017, Ramsden's first museum solo exhibition, titled "Mary Ramsden: (In / It)" was held at the Aspen Art Museum. The title of the exhibition was inspired by a Marianne Moore poem "Poetry" and a line break that is found in the poem.
Her abstract, painterly works combine gestural marks with amoeba-like shapes. Though seemingly simple and seamlessly assimilated, Ramsden's paintings are structured with a subtle thoughtfulness that allows for contemplative consideration. With slight, deliberate adjustments in color, mark-making, and scale, her works depict a progressive language that draws viewers in to examine each smudge and detail. Most of the artist's pieces are dominated by a single color, while other hues push towards the edges of the surface. In more recent pieces, Ramsden has begun generating multifaceted, meditative compositions by applying and then wiping away multiple layers of paint.

1914 Boston mayoral election

The Boston mayoral election of 1914 occurred on Tuesday, January 13, 1914. James Michael Curley, member of the United States House of Representatives, was elected Mayor of Boston for the first time, defeating Thomas J. Kenny, president of the Boston City Council.
Incumbent mayor John F. Fitzgerald withdrew in December, citing illness; in actuality, Curley and attorney Daniel H. Coakley forced Fitzgerald from the race after learning of his indiscretions with a cigarette girl, Elizabeth "Toodles" Ryan.
Curley was inaugurated as mayor on Monday, February 2, and intended to continue also serving in Congress. However, on February 25, after political pressure mounted to unseat him, Curley announced his resignation from Congress, retroactive to February 4.
This was the last January-scheduled general election for Mayor of Boston; the next mayoral election was held in December 1917.

Dara Friedman

Dara Friedman (born 1968, Bad Kreuznach, Germany) is an artist who creates film and video works that use a carefully orchestrated filming and editing process, often collaborating with individuals and communities to capture the expressive qualities of the human body.
Background.
Friedman was raised between Palm Beach County and Bad Kreuznach, Germany. Her mother is an artist and her father was a Jewish doctor in the United States Army and stationed in Germany during her youth. As a child, she took dance lessons and would attend dress rehearsals at the Düsseldorf Ballet where her aunt, , was a dancer. Dancers and performers feature frequently in Friedman's works, such as "Dancer" (2011), "Play (Parts 1 &amp; 2)" (2013), "Rite" (2014), and "Mother Drum" (2015–16).
She received her BA from Vassar College in 1990, and studied at the Städelshule in Frankfurt from 1989–91. In 1994 she received an MFA, Motion Pictures from the School of Communication at the University of Miami. Friedman studied under Austrian artist and Structural film pioneer Peter Kubelka, and describes her work as a form of poetry that communicates visually without a reliance on verbal or traditional, narrative storytelling. In 1992, she moved to Miami where she continues to participate as an active member in the artistic community.
Work and career.
Friedman's film and video work is regarded for its ability to reduce film to its most basic, material essences in ways that create emotionally compelling, visceral experiences. She often works in 16mm and Super 8 film formats, although also using standard and high-definition cameras. A rigorous planning and editing process creates a visceral visual experience that is complemented by the unpredictability of the human subjects she often works with. The artist establishes relationships with the people who perform directly for her camera, sometimes identified through a casting call, in order to create intimate filming environments that capture an element of natural spontaneity. Although these films do not have linear narratives, the calculated presentation of bodies in motion encourages the viewer to connect with the subjects and places on screen. Since the 1990s, Friedman has created film, videos, and installations that integrate these elements of structured and dynamic visuals. She is represented by Gavin Brown's enterprise, who has consistently featured Friedman's work since 1998.
Exhibitions.
The artist's first mid-career survey was organized by the Pérez Art Museum Miami by René Morales in 2017, and featured fifteen installations of her video works spanning the course of twenty years.
Solo exhibitions.
Solo exhibitions of Friedman's work have also include:
Collections.
Among the public collections holding work by Friedman are the Austrian Film Museum, Vienna; Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Pérez Art Museum Miami; Saint Louis Museum of Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

Harrington Athletics Village

The Harrington Athletics Village is a sports complex located on the Brighton Campus at Boston College in Boston, Massachusetts, United States.
The complex currently consists of the Eddie Pellagrini Diamond, which is home to the Boston College Eagles baseball team; the Boston College Softball Field, which is home to the softball team; and the Pete Frates Center, which is an indoor practice facility and hospitality area for the baseball and softball teams.
History.
Boston College acquired the lands of the Brighton Campus from the Archdiocese of Boston between 2004 and 2007. In the spring of 2004, Boston College began setting the institution's goals for the coming years. Included in the plans were the recently acquired Brighton lands, which called for a 1,500-seat baseball stadium, a 500-seat softball stadium, two intramural fields, and a field house. Future modifications reduced the plans of the fields. The baseball and softball stadium capacities were reduced to 1,000 and 300 seats respectively, while additional changes eliminated the second intramural field and shrunk the field house to before ultimately removing it from this project.
In 2016, the board of trustees at Boston College proposed the redevelopment of the Brighton Campus. The baseball and softball teams previously used Shea Field, which they shared with the football team. The Board of Trustees were motivated to provide the two programs with facilities that exceeded the Atlantic Coast Conference standards since Shea Field was inadequate. The complex development was a part of the ongoing "Greater Heights" campaign, which are efforts to improve Boston College's athletic programs.
The Brighton Baseball Field was slated to open on March 13, 2018, in Boston College's home opener against Holy Cross but was canceled due to a nor'easter. The stadium opened a week later on March 20, when the Eagles hosted cross-town opponents Northeastern in a non-conference matchup that Northeastern won 7–4 in 18 innings. The softball field opened on April 10, when the Eagles hosted the UMass Minutewomen.
On April 14, 2018, Brighton Fields were dedicated to University Trustee and former CEO of the Boston Red Sox John L. Harrington and renamed Harrington Athletics Village at Brighton Fields.
The Pete Frates Center opened in late 2020 as part of the Phase II of the project.
Venues.
Eddie Pellagrini Diamond.
Eddie Pellagrini Diamond is the home stadium for Boston College Eagles baseball. The stadium replaces their previous home at Shea Field. The stadium features an artificial turf surface and has a fixed capacity of 1,000 seats, but is expandable to 2,500 for championship events.
Boston College Softball Field.
The Boston College Softball Field is the home stadium for Boston College Eagles softball. The stadium has an artificial turf surface with a clay infield. There is seating for 300 spectators and can be expanded to 1,000 for championship events.
Pete Frates Center.
The Pete Frates Center is a indoor practice facility exclusive to the baseball and softball teams. The support building also includes locker rooms for each team. Outside, there is a terrace for fans overlooking the baseball stadium. The Frates Center includes batting cages and pitching mounds for year-round use, a state-of-the-art improvement over the program's previous conditions. Just three years prior, players had to shovel out the snowed-in batting cage in the tunnel to the Beacon Street Garage during the winter months.

Coffee production in China

Modern cultivation of coffee in China began in 1988. In 2016 and 2017, China was among the top 20 worldwide producers of coffee. Ninety-eight per cent of the coffee grown in China comes from Yunnan province.
History.
A French missionary brought coffee to Yunnan province in the late 19th century, marking the crop's introduction to China. However, the modern Chinese coffee cultivation industry began in 1988 when the Chinese government, World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme jointly initiated a program to introduce coffee growing in the region. Nestlé also arrived early in Yunnan to encourage the cultivation of coffee. Hogood Coffee, the largest domestic instant coffee maker, was founded in 2007 and has been responsible for cultivating much of the coffee in the Dehong region. Hogood capitalizes on relaxed land use policies in Yunnan which have allowed farm land consolidation through contract farming schemes; seedlings are planted by Hogood and harvested by farmers of the beans that are in the end purchased by Hogood. In 2013, Yunnan Coffee Traders became the region's first dedicated specialty coffee exporter; they are now (2018) the largest exporter of Yunnan specialty coffee in China. 
Domestic coffee consumption in China rose in parallel with an increase in domestic coffee production; from 2006 to 2017, Chinese coffee consumption had grown by an annual average of 22%.
White-collar workers are the main force of coffee consumption. In a survey, white-collar workers accounted for 30% of the total, which is the largest consumer group — followed by the government official, school staff and people who work for the organizations, accounting for 15%. The proportion of freelancers and coffee practitioners is close to that of public institutions.
Planting and varieties.
Almost all domestic coffee comes from Yunnan, accounting for 98% of production. The main regions within Yunnan for coffee production are Baoshan, Dehong, and Menglian in Pu'er. Pu'er alone accounts for 60% of the country's total production. Other provinces where coffee is grown include Fujian and Hainan.
Fujian and Hainan mainly grow robusta, while Yunnan grows arabica, with catimor (a caturra-Timor hybrid) as the varietal of choice.
Marketing and trade.
In Yunnan about half of the crop went to export markets in 2016, generating $280 million in earnings. Most Chinese coffee beans are commercial grade and exports are primarily green beans sent to European markets. The United States is also an export market for Chinese beans, with Starbucks purchasing more than half of the coffee imported into the U.S. from China in January-September 2014. Major trading houses like Volcafe, the coffee arm of London-based commodities trader ED&amp;F Man with an office in Yunnan, and Miami-based commodities trader Coex, source from China to balance deficits in supply from traditional exporting countries during years of drought or crop rust.
The emergence of dedicated specialty coffee farming commenced around 2009 under early adopters such as Hu Xixiang from Mangzhang Farms in Menglian (Pu’er), Yunnan alongside the support of industry professionals such as Timothy Heinze, Joshua Jagelman, and Saxon Wright. While specialty coffee production in China is still less than 2% of total volumes, China's recent selection (2018) as the portrait country at the world's largest Specialty Coffee trade show held by the Specialty Coffee Association emphasizes the growing recognition of China as producer of specialty grade coffees.
Chongqing has emerged as the largest domestic trading hub for coffee. The Chongqing Coffee Exchange was established by the Chongqing Energy Group as a trading platform for both home grown and Southeast Asia sourced coffee. The exchange takes advantage of Chongqing's role as a transportation hub. The city is the starting point of the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe freight train, a corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative. Pu’er City also saw the establishment of a coffee trading hub when Yunnan Coffee Exchange started operations in January 2016.

<doc id="56849833" url="?curid=56849833" title="Pelvic fin">
Pelvic fin

Pelvic fins or ventral fins are paired fins located on the ventral surface of fish. The paired pelvic fins are homologous to the hindlimbs of tetrapods.
Structure and function.
Structure.
In actinopterygians, the pelvic fin consists of two endochondrally-derived bony girdles attached to bony radials. Dermal fin rays (lepidotrichia) are positioned distally from the radials. There are three pairs of muscles each on the dorsal and ventral side of the pelvic fin girdle that abduct and adduct the fin from the body.
Pelvic fin structures can be extremely specialized in actinopterygians. Gobiids and lumpsuckers modify their pelvic fins into a sucker disk that allow them to adhere to the substrate or climb structures, such as waterfalls. In priapiumfish, males have modified their pelvic structures into a spiny copulatory device that grasps the female during mating.
Function.
In actinopterygian steady state swimming, the pelvic fins are actively controlled and used to provide powered corrective forces. Careful timing of the pelvic fin movement during whole-body movements allows the pelvic fins to generate forces that dampen the forces from the entire body, therefore stabilizing the fish. For maneuvers, electromyogram data shows that pelvic fin muscles are activated after the start of the maneuver, indicating that the fins are used more for stabilization instead of generating the maneuver.
In rays and skates, pelvic fins can be used for "punting," where they asynchronously or synchronously push off the substrate to propel the animal forwards.
Development.
Unlike limb development in tetrapods, where the forelimb and hindlimb buds emerge at roughly the same timepoint, the pelvic fin bud emerges much later than the pectoral fin. While the pectoral fin bud is apparent at 36 hours post fertilization (hpf) in zebrafish, the pelvic fin bud is only clear at around 21 days post fertilization (dpf), roughly when the animal is 8 mm in length.
In zebrafish, the pelvic fin bud starts as a mesenchymal condensation that forms an apical ectodermal thickening. A fin fold forms from this thickening, which is then invaded by migratory mesenchyme, separating the fin bud into the proximal mesenchyme (which will give rise to the endoskeletal girdle and radials) and the distal mesenchyme (which will give rise to dermal fin rays).
