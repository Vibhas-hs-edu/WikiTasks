Mary Helen Washington

Mary Helen Washington (born January 21, 1941, in Cleveland, Ohio) is an accomplished African American literary scholar and the author of numerous books on the African-American female experience. She is best known for her influence on increasing representation of Black authors in education and in literary schools of thought. Washington is a past president of the American Studies Association, and an experienced English professor.  
Early life.
Mary Helen Washington was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. She grew up in a conservative Catholic home during the 1950’s Cold War era, and attended Catholic schools throughout her childhood. American Cold War ideologies and reformations in the Catholic Church led by Pope John XXIII heavily influenced her upbringing, but ultimately led her to challenge these views by pursuing Left-wing schools of thought.
Education.
After high school, Washington attended college to study history and African American literature. She earned her undergraduate degree from Notre Dame College and went on to move to Detroit to attend graduate school in the early 1960’s. Living in Detroit, Washington felt deeply connected to the Black community and culture, which led her to become involved with the union activities of the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM). Washington received her doctorate degree in 1976 at the University of Detroit, becoming the University's English Department's first Black graduate student.
Career.
After graduating from the University of Detroit, Washington authored many of her books. She also became involved in academia, serving as the Director of Black Studies at the University of Detroit Mercy from 1976-1980 and teaching at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, from 1980 to 1990, and the University of Maryland, College Park  in the early 1990’s. Washington is a Distinguished Professor at the University of Maryland, College Park in the Department of English. She was elected president of The American Studies Association and was in that position from 1996 to 1997.
Washington’s career as an author established her a staple of African-American literature classes nationwide. She is the author of several books of cultural criticism and literary criticism, including The Other Blacklist: The African American Literary and Cultural Left of the 1950s, and has contributed to the PBS documentary series American Experience.
Influences.
In her book The Other Blacklist, Washington reflects that her anti-communist upbringing triggered her interest in communist theory and its connection to Black literature. In her work, she shows interest in influential female African American authors and artists from the Cold War era, and she explores how Leftist views influenced these authors to pursue Black radicalism and literary scholarship. As a political and social justice activist, Washington writes with the goal of challenging the canon of Afro-American Literature. She uses her scholarship to push for schools to teach material by Black women.
Washington’s work often integrates ideas of feminism and communism according to Black female experience. In her essay “Feminist Roots” published in Women's Review of Books, she critically engages with feminism’s relation communism, connecting Black feminist movements to 1930s communist labour initiatives. Washington has written four anthologies, each with different focuses under the broader idea of promoting Black female literature.
As mentioned in Paule Marshall’s obituary in The Washington Post, Washington authors a biography on Paule Marshall. Washington praises Marshall for the way “She explored a black woman’s consciousness and broke out of convention,” as well as expressing admiration for the importance of Black females writers’ “transnational view of the world.” Washington focuses on promoting the scholarship of Black authors and challenging the standards for representation in literature.  
Notable Works.
Black-Eyed Susans (1975) and Midnight Birds (1980).
"Black-Eyed Susans" is a collection of ten stories meant to challenge the stereotypes of servant, wife and mother associated with Black women. Its collection of characters convey an image of Black women that stresses their complexity and depth.
Five years later, Washington published "Midnight Birds" as a revision of "Black-Eyed Susans" that focuses on various aspects of contemporary Black women writers’ experience, exploring issues of poverty, abuse, mental illness and sexuality.
Memories of Kin (1991).
"Memories of Kin" is a collection of family-centered stories and poems. It depicts Black families' struggle to uphold traditions from a primarily female viewpoint. The collection explores the way different generations interact within families, especially mother-daughter relations.
The Other Blacklist (2014).
"The Other Blacklist" critiques the lack of influential Black literary figures accepted as literary canon. Washington focuses on the lived experiences of influential Left Black literary figures such as Lloyd Brown and Gwendolyn Brooks. Her analysis focuses on archives materials, including interviews and FBI files to push the literary canon to better represent  the role of Black authors in shaping American culture.
Awards.
She is the 1988 recipient of the Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women and has received honorary Doctorate degrees from Bridgewater State College, Emmanuel College, Notre Dame College, Regis College, and Marygrove College. In 2014 Washington was an honorable mention for the Modern Language Association’s  William Sanders Scarborough Prize. In 2015 she received the American Studies Association’s Carl Bode-Norman Holmes Pearson Prize for lifetime achievement.

Zar je važno da l' se peva ili pjeva (song)

"Zar je važno da l' se peva ili pjeva" is a song recorded by singer Lepa Brena, released on November 28, 2017 by Grand Production as the lead single from her eighteenth studio album "Zar je važno dal se peva ili pjeva" (2018). The song and music was written by Dragan Brajović Braja. "Zar je važno da l' se peva ili pjeva" is a folk and pop song, with lyrics Brena used to convey to those from the republics of the former Yugoslavia that hate is unnecessary.
The song received excellent reviews from music critics. The music video was directed by Haris Dubica.
Release and promotion.
On November 18, 2017, Brena announced a new song and album "Zar je važno da l' se peva ili pjeva", with teaser on YouTube. The spot for the single was premiered in Grand Production studio and then appeared on YouTube on the Brena's official channel. "The song talks about where we were, where we are now and where we should be in the future. Composer Dragan Brajović Braja succeeded in transferring my thoughts and emotions into one beautiful story. Raka Đokić's early departure left a great pain and emptiness in my heart. We celebrate 35 years of work and business show business and 30 years from the story Hajde da se volimo. Raka started a thread that has not been interrupted even today, and it will remain when one day I will not be dealing with this job" - said Brena, adding - "Playing in the films Tesna koža, Nema problema and Hajde da se volimo I became, so to speak, a dessert in every home during the holidays. I managed to persevere all these years and I would like to give my contribution to spreading love with music and this number. The song is something that does not have a passport, border, but flying like a pigeon that carries good and noble energy. My only task is to make people happy."
Background.
The idea of the song "Zar je važno da l' se peva ili pjeva" was created a year ago, and "the main culprit" is Brena's husband, Slobodan Živojinović, who persuaded her to make this song. "I was expecting songs in pop manner and, I really did not like it. Boba told me that if I do not want to record it, that would be his song, so he is a creative leader. It's good to have a creative partner next to yourself, like Boba" - said Brena and adding ""With this remarkable song, I announce the beginning of a major world tour, we are expecting over 60 concerts in halls from Australia across Europe to America and Canada. The crown of everything will be an exclusive documentary in which the audience will first see many unpublished footage from my previous career, and we are also thinking about the fourth part of the movie "Hajde da se volimo".""
Music video.
The video was filmed in Zagreb, Sarajevo, Belgrade, was directed by Haris Dubica. Members of "SlatkI greh" and actors Nikola Kojo, Saša Petrović, Enis Bešlagić, Emir Hadžihafizbegović and Dragan Bjelogrlić appear in the video.

2018 Elite 10 (March)

The 2018 Princess Auto Elite 10 was held from March 15 to 18 at St. James Civic Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was the fifth Grand Slam of Curling event held in the 2017–18 curling season. The tournament was held between ten men's teams.

By the mid-1940s, Winkler had become one of the most successful radio performers in the country. An article in "Billboard" magazine published in December 1944 considered Winkler to be the fourth highest paid woman in radio and called her a "heavy dough collecting" soap player.

Prior to Hall's testimony Winkler had not been officially mentioned in connection with HUAC or the Communist party.
Sensory awareness and later career.
Winkler was listed in "Red Channels" in 1950. Unable to continue to work in broadcasting, she went on to have a career as a sensory therapist.

Influenced by Selver, Winkler went on to develop a successful career in sensory awareness. Winkler was known as innovator in the study of sensory awareness and taught courses privately and at the Human Relations Center of the New School of Social Research in New York City.

Meade Esposito

Amadeo Henry "Meade" Esposito (1907 – September 3, 1993) was an American politician who was a Brooklyn Democratic leader and political boss. Esposito served as chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee from 1969 to 1984. As a leader, he was known as a political fixer, and honored loyalty, running a citywide patronage system involving gratuity exchanges that ultimately resulted in multiple municipal corruption scandals. 
Following the election of Ed Koch to the mayoralty in 1977 (an outcome facilitated by Esposito's surreptitious support, which was obscured by mutual agreement due to Koch's political origins in the postwar "Reform Democrat" movement), Esposito emerged as New York City's paramount political leader and "de facto" shadow mayor, with a sphere of influence that encompassed such disparate figures as Bronx political eminences Stanley M. Friedman, Stanley Simon and Ramon S. Velez; Brooklyn Assemblymen Stanley Fink (who also served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly at the peak of Esposito's influence) and Anthony J. Genovesi; Queens Borough President Donald Manes; Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden; Brooklyn Representatives Shirley Chisholm, Leo C. Zeferetti and Fred Richmond; conservative fixer Roy Cohn; real estate developers Fred and Donald Trump (the latter would ultimately serve as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021, impeached twice); and American Mafia leaders Anthony Scotto and Paul Vario. Critics called him a "medieval king holding court with his barons by sections of the press". 
Although he ensconced himself in the tradition of urban "Regular Democrat" machine politics, Esposito personally identified as a political liberal in marked contrast to many of his successors, frequently speaking of his admiration for George McGovern (whom he supported at great political risk in the 1972 United States presidential election) and Eleanor Roosevelt. He also was a vociferous supporter of New York City's first (and ultimately unsuccessful) LGBT rights bill. As the apex of his power coincided with historic population declines in New York stemming from decades-long white flight, Esposito moved beyond his white ethnic base in southeastern Brooklyn to collaborate with leaders of nascent African American and Hispanic and Latino American communities throughout the borough, such as City Councilman Samuel D. Wright and his successor, Enoch H. Williams.
By the early 1980s, several Brooklyn-based elected officials with national ambitions—most notably Kings County District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, liberal internationalist Representative Steve Solarz and future Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer—had either directly repudiated or distanced themselves from Esposito's influence, although Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett reported that Schumer met publicly with Esposito for lunch on at least one occasion. In 1983, investigations into his activities mounted, prompting his retirement in January 1984. Three years later, he was convicted of bribery in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, having given Bronx Representative Mario Biaggi a spa vacation in Florida. As a result of this and related scandals (including Manes' suicide and Friedman's conviction on federal corruption charges) amid the political emergence of reform-minded rivals David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani, the Esposito machine effectively collapsed. During this period, several fledgling African American politicians also withdrew their support, precipitating the 1990 election of Clarence Norman Jr. as county chairman of what had descended into a "largely vestigial structure".
Esposito was respected and feared for his street-style management, intimidation tactics and criminal connections. He became known for running politics similar to a junket.
Early life.
Amadeo "Meade" Esposito was born in the subsection of Ocean Hill, Brooklyn (alternatively characterized as part of Bedford-Stuyvesant or Brownsville) in 1907. He was the son of Giuseppe and Felicia Esposito. His grandfather came to America from Italy in 1885. His father followed his grandfather in 1900 and arrived in America at the age of 18. Giuseppe became a saloon owner. Meade lived with his two sisters above the saloon. Meade claimed to have been working since he was child.
Esposito grew up in Brownsville (then a predominately Jewish neighborhood with smaller Irish and Italian populations) and received his nickname "Meade" during elementary school. He briefly attended Park Slope's Manual Training High School, now known as the John Jay Educational Campus, but dropped out at the age of 14. He married at the age of 18 and became a father by 19.
Politics.
After dropping out of school, Esposito found employment at an insurance business (a field he would return to throughout his career) operated by Jim Powers, a former United States Marshal and local Democratic leader. There, Esposito met Hyman Schorenstein, another Brooklyn Democratic leader who went on to secure the presidential nomination for Al Smith at the party's 1928 Democratic National Convention. Schorenstein's blunt, transactional management style would profoundly influence Esposito. At the age of 18, Esposito "got a couple of dozen of the guys together" and started the Progressive Democratic Club on Fulton Street.
During the Great Depression, he primarily worked as a beer salesman and bail bondsman. He met many of his future connections through the latter business. Esposito cultivated ethnic and community ties that encouraged more Italian Americans to move into politics. He launched the career of Abe Stark (who served as New York City Council President from 1954 to 1961 and Borough President of Brooklyn from 1962 to 1970) and assisted in electing longtime New York State Assembly member Alfred Lama (best known for co-founding the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program). 
Amid redlining and white flight-driven demographic shifts in Ocean Hill-Brownsville and adjacent East New York throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Esposito's predominantly Italian and Jewish base gradually migrated to southeastern Brooklyn's semi-suburban belt of Canarsie, Flatlands and Mill Basin, culminating in the formation of the gerrymandered 39th Assembly District to represent these constituencies in 1972. As early as 1958, Esposito ran for Democratic district leader in Canarsie on a ticket with co‐leader candidate Shirley Weiner. Although they lost by 200 votes, Esposito was ultimately elected to the post in 1960 after being endorsed by Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert H. Lehman. During this period, his surreptitious influence continued to grow in tandem with the Canarsie-based Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club, which served as his primary political emplacement for the remainder of his career.
Throughout the 1960s, Esposito began to personally select many judges and politicians in Brooklyn. From 1960 to 1970, he also served as assistant vice president of the Kings Lafayette Bank "despite no apparent experience" in the profession. Jack Newfield would later report that Esposito sought the position to distance himself from his bondsman career to better ensure his political ascension, while "the single biggest depositor in the bank" during his incumbency "was the [Anthony Scotto-affiliated International Longshoremen's Association], which many law enforcement agencies believe is Mafia-dominated [...] It is suspected that the ILA used its influence to get Esposito the job."
Although Esposito attained his longtime goal of becoming chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee in 1969 as part of a byzantine power-sharing agreement with "sometimes friend and often business partner" Stanley Steingut (who sought to consolidate his control of the New York State Assembly's Democratic caucus in preparation for assuming the speakership), the Jefferson Club's influence was initially attenuated by the enduring dominance of Steingut's East Flatbush-based Madison Club, a predominantly Jewish political clearinghouse for such figures as future New York City Mayor Abe Beame, venerable jurist Nat Sobel and members of the Trump family. After Beame lost the mayoralty in 1977, the balance of power in municipal politics gradually shifted to Esposito, with the sudden death of Steingut organization éminence grise Beadie Markowitz in early 1978 all but assuring the then-Speaker's decisive defeat by primary challenger Murray Weinstein (later succeeded by his daughter, Helene Weinstein).
Esposito elicited a variety of perceptions from his peers. While Robert F. Wagner Jr. called him a "new breed of party leader", Herman Badillo, a critic of Esposito, called him "an old-line boss". During his tenure as county leader, his connections to known Mafia members and associates had become common knowledge. He grew up with Mafia associates and bailed many of them out during his years as a bail bondsman. In 1972, during a federal investigation into the Lucchese crime family, Esposito's name was frequently mentioned in a bugged junkyard trailer used as an office by Paul Vario.
Politicians traded favors and gifts with Esposito for political influence and positions, a process that greatly accelerated after he became New York City's preeminent political boss in 1978. By 1983, investigations into his increasingly conspicuous activities were growing. Despite claiming he would never retire, Esposito left his position as leader of the Kings County Democratic Committee in January 1984, leaving the position to incumbent Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden.
Nevertheless, Esposito continued to retain tremendous "behind-the-scenes" influence in New York City politics after his retirement. In the fall of 1985, during an FBI investigation into the Genovese crime family, Esposito was heard speaking with gangster and lifelong friend Federico "Fritzy" Giovanelli. This led to a direct wiretap of Esposito's phone. Later in 1985, Esposito was recorded speaking with Bronx Rep. Mario Biaggi, claiming to have "made" 42 judges in Brooklyn. Esposito was found to be involved in bribery with Biaggi, having given him a Florida vacation in return for government assistance in a financially troubled drydock firm that owed $280,000 to an Esposito-owned insurance venture. Esposito was found guilty in 1988, put on probation, sentenced to community service and fined $500,000. Biaggi was sent to jail and lost his seat in Congress. In 1989, Esposito faced additional charges of bribery and tax fraud; however a federal judge determined Esposito was too sick and elderly to maintain a proper defense.
Personal life.
Esposito was known for his "blunt, warm and earthy" nature. He frequently smoked cigars and kept a baseball bat under his desk to symbolically enforce power. Donald Trump, whose family's real estate business frequently interlocked with elements of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, respected Esposito and his management style. Esposito had a daughter, Phyllis. 
Before relocating to the North Shore of Nassau County in his final years, Esposito resided at 2600 National Drive in Mill Basin.
While serving as county leader, Esposito frequently held important meetings (as exemplified by his initial summit with Ed Koch) in the basement of his mother's Canarsie house to evade potential wiretaps at his Downtown Brooklyn office and Mill Basin home. The elder Esposito usually prepared homemade meatballs for her guests.
Death.
In the early 1990s, Esposito developed bladder and lung cancer. He died of a blood infection at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset on September 3, 1993.

African trident bat

The African trident bat ("Triaenops afer") is a species of bat found in Africa.
Taxonomy and etymology.
It was described as a new species in 1877 by German zoologist Wilhelm Peters.
It was considered a subspecies of the rufous trident bat from approximately 1963–2009, when morphological and genetic analyses showed that it was a distinct species.
Its species name "afer" is Latin for "African."
Biology and ecology.
It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves or abandoned mines.
Roosts can consist of up to half a million individuals, as this is a colonial species.
Range and habitat.
"Triaenops afer" has been documented in Eritrea, Mozambique, southwest Congo, and northwest Angola. Previously believed to be the only member of its genus found in continental Africa, recent research incorporating morphological data and echolocation calls has shown that only the populations in coastal regions along the Indian Ocean and in the highlands of central Kenya and Ethiopia are "T. afer", with the populations in the Rift Valley of Kenya actually being "Triaenops persicus".

Gonepteryx farinosa

Gonepteryx farinosa , the Powdered Brimstone, is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the whites family.
Description from Seitz.
"Gonepteryx farinosa" from West Asia (the occurrence in North Africa is very doubtful), is conspicuously larger than specimens of "G. rhamni" from Central Europe or even South France; the scaling of the male is thick, chalky, being lighter above and below on the distal portion of the wings, the whole hindwing, moreover, being somewhat lighter in tint than the forewing; the yellow central spots are more indistinct, being often absent from the forewing, especially in females; the latter still paler than "G. rhamni" females. The specific distinctness of "G. farinosa" has often been doubted, as "G. farinosa" occurs together with "G. rhamni" and "G. cleopatra" (for instance in southern Asia Minor).
Biology.
The larva feeds on "Rhamnus", "Ziziphus" , "Paliurus"

 is a Japanese watchmaker and youngest member of Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants.
As a child, Kikuno had a fascination with mechanical items. He wore out the owners manual of the family car looking through it at age 2. After high school, he joined the Japanese military where his skills in dismantling and reassembling weapons were noted and he was placed in a job repairing rifles.
Kikuno studied at the Hiko Mizuno Watchmaking School though the three year course focused on repair rather than creating new timepieces (WOSTEP). He instead turned to George Daniels step by step book "Watchmaking" and taught himself, afterwards teaching watchmaking at the school for three more years. He sold his first watch at age 29.
Kikuno rose to prominence with the debut of his 2011 adaptation of Hisashige Tanaka's myriad year clock in wristwatch form at BaselWorld. This wadokei clock which measures temporal hours which change in length with the seasons. Made completely by hand, 6 daylight hours and 6 night hours slowly move around the watch face with the seasons. Each 18million (approximately $160,000 USD) watch is tuned to the customer's latitude by Kikuno.

Siddhant Sinha is a budding lawyer, belongs to middle-class Kayastha family from Bihar, and is the son of lawyer Prabhakar Sinha who was KK's legal advisor, right-hand man, confidante, and best friend. Siddhant and Anushka are childhood friends, who broke up seven years earlier due to misunderstandings.
Siddhant's father helps KK out of any disasters in both business and personal issues. Prabhakar owes KK, who helped him 18 years ago, and also values his friendship with KK. Siddhant joins his father at the Reddys' company where Anushka has joined as the head of Human Resources.
When an accident happens to KK's rival company, said company's owner, Sumit Goyal, insists it was sabotage done by KK's company, in order to win back a certain deal KK lost. Though KK's company is able to the clear the investigation, Prabhakar has a nagging theory that perhaps KK had something to do with the incident. Prabhakar dies while trying to investigate the details of the deal and the accident. Doctors confirm his death was due to sudden cardiac arrest caused by acid reflux.
15 days later.
After Prabhakar's death, Siddhant starts to work full time for KK's son and Anushka's twin brother, Karthik and tries to mend his relationship with Anushka. As they get closer, Siddhant also starts investigating his father's death after finding a suspicious phone number from his father's mobile phone call history. The number leads him to Dinesh Swamy, Vice President of Goyal's aircraft company. He is shocked to discover that Swamy died exactly like Prabhakar shortly after Prabhakar's death. Meanwhile, Anushka's father is trying to convince her to marry.
KK brings Nupur Srivastava as a prospective bride for Karthik. During Karthik's wedding preparations, KK gets impressed by Nupur's politician cousin, Vedant. KK asks Anushka to accept, but since she loves Siddhant, she does not want to. Siddhant also loves Anushka, but during investigation he was shocked to know that his father was murdered by his best friend KK by poisoning him via "25 years of KKR Corporation" Book. So he decides it is best to keep Anushka out of the picture as he wants to take revenge to her father. Meanwhile, Karthik works closely with Purva, Siddhant's sister, in KK's company. Karthik starts to develop a physical attraction towards Purva but tries not to act upon it.
Siddhant wishes to ruin KK and his business, therefore, he creates major misunderstandings between KK's business partners often referred to as "SHARK" and creates rifts between KK's family. Meanwhile, KK is finally seen admitting his involvement in Prabhakar's death when he is by himself.
Misunderstandings increase between Siddhant and Anushka, therefore, she decides to agree to marry Vedant. Siddhant on the other hand finds out that Vedant is only marrying Anushka for money and power reasons for his career and does not love her.
Siddhant decides he wants both his love and revenge, so on Anushka's engagement day, he openly declares his love for Anushka. Although he is met with disapproval, KK says that his happiness lies in Anushka and lets them get engaged. After the ceremony, Siddhant tells KK about how he knows KK is the reason behind Prabhakar's death and that he will take revenge for that. Siddhant quits his job at Reddy Corporation and decides to go solo. He finds out that Reddy Corporation has been very sexist towards women and fires every woman who gets pregnant and asks for maternity leave. Siddhant finds over 300 cases such as this and decides to represent them all in court, pro bono
In order to prevent Siddhant and Anushka from marrying, KK threatens Gayatri, Siddhant's mother, to stop Siddhant from marrying Anushka. Despite his mother's reluctance and KK's planning, Siddhant and Anushka get married. As KK's initial plan fails, he decides to go to Plan B, by framing Siddhant with the murder of Hira Sanyal, H of SHARK. Siddhant and Anushka finally get married, but she learns about how Siddhant believes KK killed Prabhakar. Siddhant and Anushka decide to not move their relationship forward until Siddhant is able to prove KK guilty.
Meanwhile, Karthik and Purva start to talk more and get closer. One day, Nupur sees a suspicious message on Karthik's phone, from Purva and starts to suspect them. Karthik and Nupur have an argument, in which he declares his love for Purva, and KK hears this. Purva and Karthik talk and Purva finds out the truth behind Prabhakar's death. Purva also declares her feelings for Karthik. Karthik goes to declare his love for Purva to Sinha family. Siddhant beats Karthik and Gayatri slaps Purva. Finally, Anushka learns the truth about her father.

Thomas Spurgeon Page

Sir Thomas Spurgeon Page CBE (19 October 1879 – 10 February 1958) was a Northern Rhodesian politician who was a member of the Legislative Council and its first Speaker.
Biography.
Page was born in Newington in Surrey to Thomas and Louisa Page; the family initially lived in Croydon, before moving to Sutton. One of six children, he was the only boy, and attended the City of London School. After leaving school at 15, he worked at his father's solicitors offices, before joining a firm that imported German goods as a clerk. After volunteering for a Baptist church in Sutton, he moved to Nyasaland as a missionary in 1899. He was initially based in Cholo, where he was given the nickname 'Chintali' ("the long one") on account of his height. During his time in Nyasaland he learnt to speak Chewa. Page moved back to England in 1901 after suffering from malaria, but returned to Africa, relocating to Fort Jameson in Northern Rhodesia in 1907 to join his sister Grace and her husband farming cotton and tobacco.
Page married Elsie Harris in Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia on 4 June 1910, having met her in Long Sutton in 1902. The following year the couple created their own farm on virgin land, which was named Kapundi. They went on to have two daughters, born in 1911 and 1913. During World War I he was away from Northern Rhodesia for three years, initially serving with the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve and stationed near Fort Johnston, before joining the Nyasaland Field Force, in which he became a captain. After the war he was offered a job managing a tobacco farm named Msekera, eight miles from Fort Jameson. In the mid-1920s he began managing a tobacco packing business, where he worked until starting a lorry transport business in 1932, moving goods between Northern Rhodesia and Salisbury. His wife died in February 1935.
In the September 1935 general elections Page contested the Eastern seat, but was defeated by John Bruce. He ran again in the 1938 elections, this time winning the seat and becoming a member of the Legislative Council. In 1939 he bought a cottage on the outskirts of Fort Jameson and became the secretary of the Eastern Tobacco Board and the Farmers' Association, as well as doing bookkeeping. In the 1941 general elections he contested the new seat of North-Eastern and was re-elected unopposed. The following year saw Page appointed Price Controller and Fuel Controller for Northern Rhodesia, holding the former post until 1948 and the latter until 1945. The new jobs required him to move to Lusaka. He remarried in March 1943, taking Edith Mortlock as his wife. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council again in the 1944 elections, defeating Grant Robertson.
Page did not stand in the August 1948 elections, but on 10 November he was appointed the first Speaker of the Legislative Council, replacing the Governor who had previously presided over the legislature. Having already been appointed a CBE in 1947, in 1956 he was knighted in the Birthday Honours for public service. He retired as Speaker in October that year.
He died on 10 February 1958 in Lusaka and was buried in the city three days later.

Maya Dusenbery

Maya Dusenbery is an American journalist and author. She is the executive editor for editorial at feminist blog Feministing and the author of the book "Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick".
Career.
Dusenbery has said that she became motivated to become involved with feminist movements as a teenager when she read about abstinence-only education: "I clearly remember in high school reading about the Bush administration restricting funding for HIV prevention to groups that were abstinence-only and I remember thinking that was the most absurd thing I ever heard, almost criminally ridiculous."
Dusenbery began her career working as a communications assistant at NARAL Pro-Choice New York and the National Institute for Reproductive Health. Since 2009, she has reported on issues of reproductive health, including abortion stigma, rape culture, and masculinity, for Bitch Media, The Atlantic, Cosmopolitan, the Huffington Post, and Mother Jones (where she was a fellow in 2012) and Pacific Standard, where she is a columnist. In 2013, she became the editorial director of feminist media outlet Feministing. Dusenbery wrote a chapter for the Feminist Press anthology "The Feminist Utopia Project" imagining a future without rape.
In March 2018, HarperCollins published Dusenbery's book "Doing Harm: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick," an analysis of gender bias in modern medical treatment in the United States. Dusenbery's personal experience motivated her to write the book: She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 27 and was surprised to learn that 50 million Americans suffer from autoimmune diseases, the majority of them women. Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, saying it "skillfully interweaves history, medical studies, current literature, and hard data to produce damning evidence that women wait longer for diagnoses, receive inadequate pain management, and are often told they are imagining symptoms that are taken seriously in men." The book also received a positive review from Kirkus Reviews, which described it as a "sturdy account of how sexism in medicine is hobbling women’s health care." "Doing Harm" was highlighted as a recommended read by Popular Science, Harpers Bazaar, and Bitch Media.
Personal life.
Dusenbery is a native of Minnesota and received a B.A. from Carleton College in 2008. She now lives in the Twin Cities.

Betty Todd

Elizabeth Todd (born 1908 Asheville, North Carolina - December 31, 1971) was a radio director and producer in the 1940s in New York City. Todd studied radio broadcasting at Columbia University before going to work for CBS Radio. Todd was forced to resign from CBS after she was subpoenaed by, and testified before, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1950. Todd died in Bath, Maine.
Education and Career.
Todd attended high school in Buncombe County, North Carolina, and attended the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill from 1924 to 1927 but did not receive a degree.[1] She moved to New Orleans and worked as a bookkeeper and secretary before returning to North Carolina in 1928, when she began work as a secretary in the Department of Conversation and Development. Todd worked as a secretary n North Carolina, California, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C. from 1928 to 1938. Her secretarial and stenography work occurred alongside her involvement with the Communist Party and labor organizing efforts.
Todd's radio career began in 1940 when she worked as writer at the WBT radio station in Charlotte, North Carolina,[1] eventually also working as a director and producer there. After moving to New York City in 1941, Todd studied radio broadcasting at Columbia and in June 1942 began a position at CBS radio. Todd joined the CBS production department as an assistant director.[2] Todd continued to work at CBS until 1950 and was active in the Radio Director's Guild. In 1948, Todd was nominated for an executive post with the Radio Director's Guild as a councilor-at-large and was also nominated for secretary of the Radio and Television Director's Guild in 1949.[3][4] During her career at CBS Todd worked as an assistant director for the Radie Harris program, an interview show, directed the Arthur Godfrey Show, and served as assistant director of network operations.[5] [6] She also was the producer of "Joyce Jordan, Girl Interne". CBS requested and accepted Todd's resignation in 1950 due to her refusal to answer questions during her appearance before the HUAC.[7]
Politics.
Todd's affiliation with the Communist Party and labor organizations began when she became acquainted with Kenneth McConnell while working at J. Walter Thompson Advertising Company Francisco in the late 1920s. Todd married McConnell, a political activist, in 1930 and they moved to Chapel Hill in 1931. McConnell was recruited into the Communist Party in 1935 and Todd joined as a member of the Communist Party sometime in the mid-1930s.[1] When McConnell was assigned to Knoxville by the Communist Party, Todd applied for a clerk position at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). While working at the TVA, Todd recruited members for the Communist Party. Following her divorce from McConnell in 1937 and subsequent marriage to Merwin "Pat" Todd, an electrician, Todd moved to New York City in 1938 then back to North Carolina in 1940.[6] In 1940, Todd was listed as one of forty-five suspected Communist Party members employed by the TVA in a letter sent to the chair of the TVA by J. Edgar Hoover.[1] An internal TVA investigation could not confirm that Todd was a member of the Communist Party.[1] In 1950, she was identified by William Remington in his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee
After Todd invoked the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer questions in a HUAC hearing, she ceased working for CBS on May 15, 1950. CBS described the separation as a "requested and accepted" resignation, while Todd described it as "my summary dismissal".

Monroe Wheeler

Monroe Wheeler (13 February 1899 – 14 August 1988) was an American publisher and museum coordinator.
Life.
Wheeler was born in Evanston, Illinois in 1899. He met Glenway Wescott who was to be friend or partner for the rest of their lives in 1919. In the 1920s Wescott and Wheeler were working in Germany and France.
With an inheritance from his family, Wheeler bought a small printing press, and with Barbara Harrison, established "Harrison of Paris", specializing in limited-edition books; they published in total thirteen books, including two works by Wheeler's partner, Glenway Wescott. In 1934 they moved the press to New York City. The last book published by "Harrison of Paris" was "Hacienda" by Katherine Anne Porter.
In 1935 Wheeler was employed by New York's Museum of Modern Art. He was on the Library Committee and in three years he was "Director of Membership" and the following year "Director of Publications". In 1940 MOMA created the role of "Director of Exhibitions" and Wheeler was the first person to hold the post. In 1944 he became one of MOMA's Trustees and later he sat on the Executive Committee, the Exhibitions Program Committee, and also the Coordination Committee. After the war in 1948, Wheeler was leading the Exhibitions and Publications, the outreach programs and the library.
For over ten years, photographer George Platt Lynes had a relationship with Wheeler and Glenway Wescott. Both Paul Cadmus, "Conversation Piece" (1940), then Jared French, "Glenway Wescott, George Platt Lynes and Monroe Wheeler" made a triptych portrait of Wheeler, Wescott and Platt Lynes. "When We Were Three: The Travel Albums of George Platt Lynes, Monroe Wheeler, and Glenway Wescott, 1925-1935" was published in 1998. Another of Wheeler's lovers was Christian William Miller.
When Lloyd Wescott, Glenway's brother, moved to a farm in Union Township in 1936, Wescott, Wheeler and Lynes took over one of Lloyd's farm's houses and named it "Stone-Blossom". In 1959, when Lloyd Wescott acquired a farm near Rosemont in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, Glen Wescott moved into a stone house named "Haymeadows" on his brother's land.
In 1987, Glen Wescott died of a stroke at home. Wheeler died in New York City in 1988, but his ashes were buried with Wescott and this latter family at Haymeadows.

Belchamp Hall

Belchamp Hall is a Queen Anne style country house in Belchamp Walter, near Braintree, Essex, England. It is a privately owned Grade II* listed building.
It is constructed of red brick in two storeys in a double-pile plan form with a gabled peg-tile roof with attics. The front facade has nine bays with a parapet. The central bay projects and is surmounted by a pediment. The house was built c.1720 in place of an original Elizabethan house and offers good views across the valley of the Belchamp Brook to the village of Bulmer.
The interior panelling is Elizabethan or Jacobean, probably from the original building. Numerous family portraits by well-known artists decorate the walls.
The surrounding parkland, significantly reduced in size since 1741, is itself Grade II listed.
History.
The estate and original house was bought from Sir John Wentworth by John Raymond in 1611. Members of the Raymond family have lived in either the previous or the present hall since then. Oliver Raymond, the son of John Raymond, lived in the previous hall in the 1600s and was Member of Parliament for Essex in the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654 and re-elected in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament. Samuel J. St. Clere Raymond died at the present hall in 1900 after inheriting it 6 years previously. He was succeeded by Samuel Philip St. Clere Raymond and he by Michael Murray John Raymond, M.C.
The hall was used as the setting in the 1990s for the fictional "Felsham Hall" in the TV series "Lovejoy". It is now available as a wedding venue.

Cornelia Wyngaarden

Cornelia Wyngaarden (1942) is a Canadian media artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia. She creates works in video, sculpture, and installation, and has played a significant role in the development and institutionalization of new media in Vancouver.
Artistic career.
Wyngaarden has worked in various artist-run centres in Vancouver as a bookkeeper, editor, grant writer, administrator, photographer, fundraiser, and artist. Her video-based installations and single channel videotapes explore feminist themes, issues of gender, sexuality, technology, and the ways in which history and social conditions have complicated women's rights. She juxtaposes technological media with human subject matter to extend the interpretive possibilities of her work.
Wyngaarden's work also addresses cross-dressing either overtly or subtextually, in order to deconstruct stereotypes and power relations. Employing lived experience, queer theory, and "forgotten" history and cultural mythology, her video installations also create an arena for queer representation.
Artworks.
"As A Wife Has A Cow".
Originally installed in 1985 and remastered in 2015, the work is a video portrait of the life of a rancher named Keely Moll. Exploring her confidence and life through her perspective, this work shifts the Western gender paradigm of a man in the landscape by restituting female imagery. Her view is accompanied by a complex network of family relations, the land, labour and community; aspects that the Western Front Gallery has considered "facets of a life well lived."
"Apollo's Kiss/Matricide: An Allegorical Landscape".
Originally installed in 1991 and remastered in 2015, "Apollo's Kiss/Matricide: An Allegorical Landscape" is a lightbox photograph taking inspiration from Aeschylus's Oresteia, spotlighting the tragic fate of Cassandra. Her representation of the female protagonist challenges the dominant male order. The market value of this work is estimated at $2,500.
"Forged Subjectivity".
"Forged Subjectivity" is an exhibition employing multiple screens, photo-transparencies, paintings, medical artifacts, and text to expose the compulsory nature of identifying and institutionalizing sexual difference, and the consequent perpetuation of gender roles. Constructing a fictional biography of a cross-dressing Member of Parliament named John White, née Eliza McCormick, Wyngaarden erodes masculine and heterosexual influences in the writing of history. John White's life is used as an entry point into the examination of the omission of cross-dressed women and lesbians from collective history.
"The Fragility of Origins".
"The Fragility of Origins" is a 1994 video-based installation focusing on women's bodies in relation to art, historical practice, and other theoretical discourses. Through the combination of video, baroque painting allusions, photography, and text, Wyngaarden critiques many postmodern positions at a moment where marginalized subjects are becoming authors themselves.
Awards.
She received the VIVA Award in 1998, from the Jack and Doris Shadbolt Foundation for the Visual Arts.
Permanent collections.
Wyngaarden has work in the permanent collections of The National Gallery of Canada, The Canada Council Art Bank, 49th Parallel Gallery in New York, and The California College of Art.

Equal Suffrage League of Virginia

The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was founded in 1909 in Richmond, Virginia. Like many similar organizations in other states, the league's goal was to secure voting rights for women. When the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1920, enabling women to vote in all states, the Equal Suffrage League dissolved and was reconstituted as Virginia League of Women Voters, associated with the national League of Women Voters. The 19th Amendment was not ratified in Virginia until 1952.
Lila Meade Valentine was the first president and Kate Waller Barrett was vice president. Adele Goodman Clark served as the secretary for one year and headed the group's lobbying efforts in the Virginia General Assembly. Other cofounders included Nora Houston, Ellen Glasgow, and Mary Johnston.
History.
Founding.
The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was formed out of a series of meetings in November 1909 at the home of the Anne Clay Crenshaw, daughter of Kentucky suffragist Mary Jane Warfield Clay. Located at 919 West Franklin Street in Richmond, the home is part of the West Franklin Street Historic District and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The minutes of the first meeting on November 20 describe the attendees as "women interested in the formation of the Virginia Suffrage League" At a second meeting held one week later, officers and a board of directors were elected. Among the original eighteen founders were Lila Meade Valentine (president), Kate Waller Barrett (vice president), Adele Goodman Clark (secretary), Nora Houston, Ellen Glasgow, and Mary Johnston. In the first year, the league enrolled 120 members, mostly in Richmond. The majority of its members were socially prominent women.
On January 21, 1910, the league hosted their first major public event, a guest lecture by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
Opposition.
By 1909 when the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was founded, the national suffrage movement had gained considerable traction. The movement lagged behind in Virginia as elsewhere in the South where both supporters and opponents sought to safeguard white dominance. Anti-suffragists argued that extending the vote to women would threaten white hegemony by giving more African Americans the right to vote while supporters of woman suffrage countered, not by condemning white supremacy, but by arguing that woman suffrage would not have a significant racial impact at the polls.
Growth.
Although affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association from the early days, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia found itself struggling to catch up to the progress of the national movement. Where the NAWSA had moved on to lobbying and direct political activism, the Virginia movement had to focus on education and awareness. Effectively, the ESL was about 20 years behind the national movement, which meant the state initiative was off to a slow start.
Early efforts of the group included canvassing, distributing leaflets, and public speaking events. Leaders across the state visited women’s colleges, schools, fairs, and union meetings. In Richmond, a group of businessmen were encouraged to join the effort and founded the Men’s Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. These efforts paid off in a rapidly expanding movement. By 1914, the league included 45 chapters across the state, a number that increased to 115 by 1916. In 1919, ten years after the founding, the ESL reached 30,000 members. By this time, efforts toward changes in the state constitution intensified with the ESL actively lobbying for an amendment to the state constitution that would permit women to vote.
Failure and success.
Disbanded shortly after the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia was reconstituted as the Virginia League of Women Voters. Their stated purpose was to register women voters, to educate them on the issues, and to advocate for social reform. With the passage of the 19th Amendment, women in Virginia gained the right to vote, but the amendment was not ratified by the Virginia General Assembly until 1952.

Archibald Tucker

Archibald Norman Tucker (1904-1980) was a South African-born linguist specializing in African languages, "'Archie' to his innumerable friends". He earned his MA degree at the University of Cape Town. He did some study of Bantu languages in southern Africa and also made a trip to Sudan to study languages there.
He later moved to England in 1931. In London, Tucker studied under Alice Werner and Daniel Jones, earning his Ph.D. at University College London. Later he studied for a short time under Carl Meinhof in Hamburg.
He was hired to teach at the School of Oriental Studies, being named a Professor of East African Languages in 1951. During his 39 years teaching there, "a number of students passed through his hands; many of them were later to become experts in various languages. But it was for his research, and he publications resulting therefrom, that he will be chiefly remembered.” 
Tucker studied a number of African languages, including languages known as Dinka, Ganda, Kikuyu, Luo (Kenya and Tanzania), Masai, Lamba, Shona, Sukuma, Ntomba, Nyor, and comparative Eastern Sudanic languages. Tucker is known primarily for his two books published with Margaret Bryan: "The Non-Bantu Languages of Northeastern Africa" (1956) and a decade later "Linguistic Analyses: The Non-Bantu Languages of North-Eastern Africa." According to Google Scholar, this monumental volume has been cited over 325 times by other scholars.

Charles Sutherland (Surgeon General)

Charles Sutherland (May 10, 1831 – May 10, 1895) was an American doctor and officer in the United States Army. He was most notable for his service as Surgeon General of the United States Army.
Early life.
Charles Sutherland was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 10, 1831, the son of Mary (Read) Sutherland and Joel Barlow Sutherland. Charles Sutherland was educated at private schools in Philadelphia, and attended Jefferson Medical College. He received his M.D. degree in 1849, and became a physician.
Start of career.
In 1852, Sutherland joined the United States Army as a contracted assistant surgeon. Sutherland passed his 1853 examination for appointment in the Army, and received his commission as a first lieutenant in the Medical Corps.
Sutherland served initially at Fort Monroe, Virginia and Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. After assisting to combat a cholera outbreak at Jefferson Barracks, Sutherland traveled west with the surveying party that decided upon the location for Fort Riley, Kansas and began construction of the post.
Following the Fort Riley expedition, Sutherland was assigned to duty in New Mexico, and served at posts including Fort Webster, Fort Fillmore, Fort Craig, Fort Stanton, and Fort Marcy. Sutherland served in New Mexico during the period when use of the Santa Fe Trail enabled white Americans to begin settling the Southwestern United States, and he took part in military actions against the Apache and Comanche tribes of Native Americans who resisted.
Sutherland was promoted to captain in 1857. Immediately prior to the American Civil War, Sutherland served at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, followed by postings to Fort Davis and Fort Duncan in Texas.
Civil War.
At the start of the American Civil War, soldiers loyal to the Confederate States of America took over U.S. Army posts in Texas, and Sutherland narrowly escaped capture. He made his way to New York with other U.S. Army soldiers who had been stationed in Texas, and then received orders to take part in the expedition to garrison Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island near Pensacola, Florida. Possession of this post was important to the war effort because it demonstrated that the Union maintained a presence in the southern states while also contributing to the Union's effort to blockade the southern ports. Confederates unsuccessfully attempted to take the fort in 1861's Battle of Santa Rosa Island, an engagement in which Sutherland was a participant.
In April 1862, Sutherland was promoted to major and assigned to Fort Warren, Massachusetts, where Union soldiers guarded Confederate prisoners of war. Later that year Sutherland traveled west, and was assigned as chief medical purveyor for Union Army units in and around Corinth, Mississippi. He subsequently established medical supply depots in Columbus, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee, followed by setting up army field hospitals in Mississippi and Tennessee, as well as a floating hospital on the Mississippi River which was used by the Army of the Tennessee during the Vicksburg Campaign. During the Siege of Vicksburg, Sutherland served on the staff of Army of the Tennessee commander Ulysses S. Grant as assistant medical director and inspector of camps and transports. He took part in the Battle of Jackson and the Battle of Champion Hill, and was commended by Grant for effective medical support and efforts to improve camp hygiene, which caused the number of illnesses and deaths from malaria, smallpox and other diseases to be lower than had been the case in previous campaigns.
After the fall of Vicksburg, Sutherland was assigned as medical director for the Department of Virginia and North Carolina, with responsibility for medical support to units in the field, five rear area general hospitals. In the spring of 1864, Sutherland was appointed chief medical purveyor for the Army of the Potomac and the Army hospitals in and around Washington, DC. His assignment was later expanded to included hospitals in and around Annapolis, Maryland, and he remained in this position until the end of the war.
Following the Confederate surrender, Sutherland was praised by the Secretary of War for his successful acquisition, storage, and dissemination of more than $4 million in medical supplies and equipment (over $60 million in 2018). In 1865, he received brevet promotions to lieutenant colonel and colonel in recognition of the superior service he rendered throughout the war.
Post-Civil War.
After the war, Sutherland was appointed as chief purveyor of the medical supply depot in Washington, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1866. He later served as chief purveyor of the New York City medical supply depot, and he remained in this position until 1876.
In June 1876, Sutherland was promoted to colonel and assigned as medical director of the Division of the Pacific. He held this position until 1884, when he was assigned as medical director for the Division of the Atlantic.
Surgeon General.
Sutherland was promoted to brigadier general in December 1890 and appointed as Surgeon General of the United States Army, succeeding Jedediah Hyde Baxter. During his tenure, the Medical Department began the procedure of providing doctors instruments at the medical facilities where they worked, rather than issuing them personal equipment for which they were individually accountable. He also oversaw the organization of enlisted Medical Corps soldiers into detachments, and created the first Medical Corps school for enlisted soldiers at Fort Riley, Kansas.
In 1893, Sutherland retired and was succeeded by George Miller Sternberg.
Retirement and death.
In retirement, Sutherland was a resident of Washington, DC. He died there on May 10, 1895, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 1, Graves 152 A-B.
Family.
Sutherland's first wife was Kate Brewer (1837–1866). In 1869, he married Elizabeth Wirt Brewer (1847–1918), the sister of his first wife. Charles and Elizabeth Sutherland were the parents of seven children. In Sutherland's 1895 obituaries, their ages were reported as ranging from nine to 24, and their names were given as Lucy, Edith, Catherine, Douglas, Roy, Malcolm, and Agnes.

Banshū dialect

The , also called the , is a Japanese dialect spoken in the Harima region (corresponding to the boundaries of the former Harima Province) of southwestern Hyōgo Prefecture. Although it is included in the Kansai dialect group, it shares much of its vocabulary with Chūgoku group. It can be further subdivided into the and the .
Outline.
The Banshū dialect is flanked by the , , , and dialects, the last two being closely related to the better-known and dialects, respectively. In addition, the dialect, spoken between Kobe and Himeji, is distinct from the . For this reason, Ryōji Kamata regards the Banshū dialect as the most representative of Hyōgo Prefecture, where Japanese transitions between the Kansai dialect group in the east and the Chūgoku group in the west.
The Banshū dialect's subdivisions correspond well to the various river basins over which it is spoken. In particular, the Western Banshū dialect area comprises the Ibo River basin and the cities of Tatsuno, Aioi, Akō, and Shisō and the towns of Taishi (Ibo District), Kamigōri (Akō District), and Sayō (Sayō) on the basin, and the Eastern Banshū dialect area comprises the basins of the , , and Rivers. Although Himeji City is generally considered part the Western Banshū (geopolitical) area (see for example ), its subdialect is best classed with the Eastern Banshū group. Owing to the increased economic intercourse between the coastal region of the Eastern Banshū (geopolitical) area and the Osaka area, as well as the former's consequential urbanization and industrialization (see ), the coastal Eastern Banshū dialects have been influenced by the Osaka dialect.
The that marks part of the boundary between Hyōgo and Okayama Prefectures also marks the furthest western extent of the Western Banshū dialect group, and upon crossing over the pass, one encounters the Okayama dialect of the Chūgoku dialect group. However, the zone of contact between the Okayama dialect and the aforementioned subdialects of the City of Akō and of the towns of Kamigōri and Sayō has some distinctive features (as a result of dialect mixture). The Banshū area is also in contact with Awaji Island across the Akashi Strait, but that island's Awaji dialect shares common features instead with such as the and dialects, and is quite distinct from Banshū.
Segmental phonology.
Like other Kansai dialects, the Banshū dialect has a minimal length restraint of two moras for phonological words. Therefore, words that are underlyingly one mora are realized with a long vowel in isolation; for example, /ki/ ("tree") and /me/ ("eye") are pronounced [kiː] and [meː], respectively, in isolation in Banshū dialect (but cf. forms with a following particle, which is considered part of the phonological word; for example with the nominative case particle "=ga": "ki=ga" → [ki.ga] and "me=ga" → [me.ga], with no vowel lengthening), but [ki] and [me] in standard Japanese, which lacks the minimal length constraint. In contrast, long vowels in some grammatical forms, including the volitional and the infinitive of adjectives, are shortened (the latter only for adjectives of root length at least two moras); for example, Banshū dialect has "ik-o=ka" ("go.=") and "hay-o nar-u" ("fast. become.") for standard "ik-oo=ka" and "haya-ku nar-u", respectively (see "" for more information on the second example, which involves a euphonic change followed by monophthongization followed by vowel shortening). Also, the western subdialects have the monophthonization /ai/ to /ee/.
As in the Tanba dialect, alternations between the phonemes /d/ and /z/ are seen before all vowels. For instance, "ademichi" ("footpath between rice fields"), "denbu" ("all"), "sendai" ("garden"), and "atsu-i=do" ("hot.=") for standard "azemichi", "zenbu", "senzai", and "atsu-i=zo", respectively. There is also some alternation with these phonemes and /r/; for example, "see=∅ raite-ik-o" ("Keep up the hard work!", lit. "spirit= take out.") for standard "see=∅ dasite-ik-oo" (again, this example features a euphonic change in addition to the phonological change; see below).
Prosody.
The subdialects spoken in the southern and eastern parts of the Banshū (geopolitical) area, which comprises the cities of Akashi, Kakogawa, Takasago, Miki, Ono, Kasai, Nishiwaki, and Katō, the towns of Inami, Harima, Fukusaki, and Ichikawa, the city of Himeji (excepting the vicinity of the district) and the southern part of the town of Taka, use a Keihan type (wordtone and accent) pitch accent system. Among these, Himeji, Akashi, and others use a system identical to that of Kobe (see the table at right), while the accent used in the vicinity of Nishiwaki and Ono differs in that unaccented low-tone nouns (like those in class 2.4, and also "usagi" ("rabbit") and "midoriiro" ("green")) have a pitch rise between the first and second moras rather than between the penultimate and ultimate moras (so for instance, "usagi" and "midoriiro" are LLH~LLL-H and LLLLH~LLLLL-H in the Kobe-type subdialects but LHH and LHHHH in the Ono-type subdialects). The Ono-type accents represent an older form of the Keihan-type accent.
On the other hand, the subdialects of the northern and western Banshū (geopolitical) area, which comprises the cities of Aioi, Akō, Shisō, and Tastuno, the towns of Kamikawa, Taishi, Kamigōri, and Sayō, the vicinity of the Hayashida-chō district of Himeji, and the northern part of Taka, use the accent system. In the Keihan system, 2-mora nouns can begin with either high tone (classes 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) or low tone (classes 2.4, and 2.5), but this opposition has been lost in the Tarui type accent (high and low tones on the first mora are in free variation). Even within the same cities and towns, there are variations by neighborhood and age, the younger generation's speech has been influenced by the standard Japanese used in the media, so while we speak of a single "Tarui type" accent system, in fact there is great diversity within that system.
2-mora nouns of the classes 2.2 and 2.3 have merged in the Keihan type system; the notation 1/23/4/5 is used to express this. The Tarui type accent of Taishi, described in the table and also employed in areas such as Akō, Tastuno, and Aioi, would then be represented 14/23/5. This is said represent the most original Tarui type accent. The accent of Kamikawa (14/235b/5a) has split the original 2.5 class, with nouns such as "aki" ("autumn"), "ame" ("rain"), "ase" ("sweat"), and "ayu" ("sweetfish") in the 2.5a class and nounslike "kumo" ("spider"), "koe" ("voice"), "saru" ("monkey"), and "tsuru" ("crane") in the 2.5b class. Generally it is thought that the pitch contour of the 2.5a class is the original, and that the nouns of the 2.5b class diverged from it. The accent of Sayō (14/235), also used in places such as Shisō, differs from the others by the presence of a high tone on the first mora of class 2.5a and 2.5b nouns; this accent system is also used in the non-Banshū dialects of the cities of Tanba in Hyōgo Prefecture and Fukuchiyama in Kyoto Prefecture, as well as that of the Ikuno-chō neighborhood of the city of Asago. The Kamikawa subdialect is believed to be in the process of abandoning its own system in favor of the 14/235 system as well. Especially among young people in the 14/235 region, a trend towards a high tone on the first mora of class 2.4 nouns is seen, perhaps due to influence from the accent system of Standard Japanese. That is to say, these regions are in the process of adopting the system of the (non-Banshū) dialect of the Asago-chō neighborhood of Asago City (1/2345). Young people even in other (non-Banshū) regions where the Tarui type accent is used are being influenced by the accent system of the standard language, and as a result the number of people in those areas who do not follow the patterns of the chart is increasing.
In regions using the Keihan system, there is a distinction made between 1-mora H- and L-verbs, as shown in the chart. Tarui type regions lack this distinction, pronouncing both classes the same (with the sole exception of the verb "or-" ("exist-"), which is F~H-L in both areas).
In the Keihan type regions, the pitch contour of 2-mora adjectives is the same as in places like Kyoto, namely HL. Tarui type regions, on the other hand, have the same pitch contour for such adjectives as in the Tajima and Okayama dialects, with either LH~LH-L or HH~HH-L in free variation. Elderly speakers of the Western Banshū dialect still preserve the distinction between H- (LF~LH-L) and L-adjectives (HL). In recent years, that distinction is in decline, with their merger into LF~LH-L that started among young people steadily becoming mainstream.
Grammar.
Conjugation.
There is a tendency, especially prominent with upper monograde verbs like "mi-" ("see") and 2-mora lower monograde verbs like "uke-" ("receive"), for verbs of the monograde class to be conjugated using the quadrigrade pattern; some speakers have fully migrated all monograde verbs to the quadrigrade class:
The "-ba" ending of the provisional form fuses with the realis stem, with the final "-e" of that stem being deleted and the initial "-b-" of the provisional ending either changing to a palatal glide, as in "ik-ya" ("go.") and "yoker-ya" ("good.") for standard "ike-ba" and "yokere-ba", respectively, or disappearing entirely, as in "ik-a" and "yoker-a".　However, in the modern Eastern Banshū dialect, the conditional form + "-tara" is often used in place of the provisional:
A merger of the conclusive and adnominal for adjectival nouns is also heard:

Eleeshushe Parr

Eleeshushe Parr (Elishusee/Ilisusi/Elishushi/Elishusee/Elisusi/Illishushi/Parr Parr) (June 9, 1896 – February, 1975) was an Inuk graphic artist and sculptor, from the Kingnait area, who produced over 1,160 drawings. Her work has been exhibited in Canada, the United States, and Sweden.
Background.
Eleeshushe and her husband, the sculptor and printmaker Parr (1893-1969), lived a traditional nomadic lifestyle with their nine children, both biological and adopted. The couple settled in Cape Dorset Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), Canada  in 1961, after her aging spouse suffered declining health and fell victim to frostbite, resulting in partial amputation of his right foot. Eleeshushe's children Nuna (b. 1949), Eepervik, and Quvianatuliak Parr (b. 1930) are also artists in Cape Dorset. Parr's grandson, Peter Parr (b. 1970), is also an artist.
Artistic career.
Eleeshushe began drawing during the formative years of Cape Dorset's printmaking. One of the more prolific Inuit artists she left over 1,000 prints in the archives of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative. Her drawings were included in the annual Cape Dorset Graphics Collection from 1966 to 1969. In 1970, the WBEC changed the name of its annual 'graphics' collection to 'print' collection. This 83 print collection, the 11th, was the last collection for Eleeshushe Parr. The collection opened on October 31 at 50 galleries, with the official opening at the Quest in Victoria, British Columbia. Eleeshushe also occasionally made carvings, and was recognized by her community for her designs and her ability to sew traditional skin garments with inset patterns.
Prints, such as "Boy Playing With Dogs" (1966), demonstrate Eleeshushe's typical depictions of animals, Inuit people and elements of life in Northern Canada. In this specific work, a young Inuk boy plays with dogs, simulating a hunting scene where the dogs represent game and the boy is about to harpoon. The imitation of hunters is an important element in the education of boys. The stencilled drawing has soft shapes of little detail except for the boy's and animal's eyes, mouth and nose.

Cecilia Paredes

Cecilia Paredes (Lima, 1950) is a Peruvian-born multimedia artist residing in Philadelphia. Her primary themes include the power of nature, femininity, and migration, which have been subjects of many of her shows. She frequently utilizes natural elements, often recycled waste materials and primarily organic ones, in her installations. One of her best-known works is "Paisajes" in which she camouflages herself and uses her own figure as a canvas for body painting.
Education and Career.
Born in Lima, Paredes has lived outside of Peru since her youth. She studied Plastic Arts in the Universidad Católica de Lima, in the Cambridge Arts and Crafts School in England and the Scuola del Nudo of the Academy of Fine Art in Rome. She completed residencies at the University of Pennsylvania and the Banff Centre of Canada.
During the 1970s, as a student in Lima, Paredes engaged in intense political activism which caused her to be exiled from Peru, along with her husband. She lived in Mexico for 5 years and in Costa Rica for almost 25 years. She currently lives and works in San José, Costa Rica and in the United States, in Philadelphia,
Collectively she has shown her works in various biannual shows such as the Havana Biennial, Venice Biennale or the Bienal de Arquitectura de Canarias. She has been an invited international artist in the Feria FIA de Caracas in 2008.
Her works have been exhibited in places such as the Tabacalera Promoción del Arte (Madrid, 2015), the Hermitage Museum, the Vladimir Palace (Russia, 2013) and the Museo de la Fotografía (Colombia, 2013).
Work.
Paredes herself is often the central subject not only of her performances but also of her photographs and art, and yet, frequently she is not recognized and appears hidden among the natural materials that she uses, or appears blended and transformed into folds of fabric. In her photographs Paredes camouflages herself as animals or mythological beings, often surrounded by backgrounds of ornamental flowers.
She is primarily known for her permanent photo series "Paisajes" in which she explores the juxtaposition of her body with patterns and the surfaces beneath it. These photographs are composed by way of the selection of a structured background, such as a paper floral tapestry, and her intricate painting of her body so that it matches. The inevitable outlines of her form for the most part encircle her and manifest themselves, depending upon the angle of the camera. In some cases, only a shock of dark hair reveals that a person is in the photograph. Reviews of her shows have stated that Paredes intentionally puts the viewer off-balance by "erasing the line between body and background, throwing what’s real into question in both the artist and her backdrop, and Paredes rips off the stable ground beneath her viewers’ feet".
María José Monge, Curator of Visual Arts of the Museo of the Banco Central of Costa Rica, explains that during the time that Paredes lived in Costa Rica she began the precedent of the developing object works and installations, using natural resources as primary source material and in the use of the body itself as a reference and expressive medium. (""En el período que Cecilia vivió en Costa Rica sentó precedentes en el desarrollo de obras objetuales e instalaciones, en el empleo de recursos naturales como materia prima y en el uso del cuerpo propio como referente y medio expresivo"”)
As themes of migration and displacement dominate her work, along with the use of natural elements, when asked about the impact of physical location on her art, Paredes replies that: "...Costa Rica, for example, gives you exuberant nature, whereas Peru gives you the highlands as a predominant image so you have to attend to those influences. Pennsylvania gives me wonderful forests, for example. It’s one of the most serene and beautiful places I have been to and I’m very attached to it."
Among her artistic influences are Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington who Paredes refers to as "sus madres" ("her mothers"). She explains that "They opened the door to show me that everything is possible, everything is makeable." ("Ellas" -explica- "me abrieron la puerta para decirme que todo es posible, todo es factible"). She also recognizes in her work the influence of Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois, William Kentridge and Anselm Kiefer.
One of Paredes' photographs has been used as cover art for a reprint of the Brian Moore novel "Judith Hearn", which was later republished and produced as a stage play and film "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn".
Paredes' works served as the inspiration for Argentinean actress and singer Mía Maestro in her 2014 music video "Blue Eyed Sailor", directed by Guillermo Navarro and Juan Azulay.
Personal life.
Paredes has two sons, Simon Flores (born 1975) and Matias Flores (born 1977), and is married to the composer and University of Pennsylvania professor Jay Reise. She has collaborated with him, incorporating video into live musical performances, such as The Gift to Urashima Taro.

Alexandra Bischoff

Alexandra Bischoff (born 1991 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian artist who works primarily in performance, with an emphasis on sexuality and feminism. She lives and works in Montréal, Quebec.
Life and education.
Bischoff received a Fine Art Diploma in 2012 from McEwan University, Alberta, Canada. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Art from Emily Carr University of Art + Design, where she was named valedictorian of her 2015 undergraduate class. She is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts at Concordia University in the department of Intermedia (Video, Performance, and Electronic Arts).
Work.
Bischoff's artistic practice, primarily in performance, video, and text, responds to the complexities of female sexuality and is influenced by her research engaging with archives. Bischoff's archival research led to the "Rereading Room", an exhibition of the Vancouver Women's Bookstore's inaugural 1973 catalogue. "The Rereading Room" initially was at exhibited at 221A in 2016-17 and, in 2018, was included in the "Beginning with the Seventies: GLUT" at the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery.
Also in 2018, Bischoff participated in the group exhibition "SOOT", emerging from her publication of the same name. "SOOT" is a recount of Bischoff's experiences having been employed at a retail sex shop in Vancouver.
In 2017, "Decoy" "Magazine" published "Happenstance", a series of temporary artworks by eleven artists including Bischoff, who worked in public spaces in the city of Vancouver. For this project, Bischoff explored the senses as her main theme for her work "thrum". She performed her piece by walking across and interacting with the Granville Bridge in a time-based performance.
Bischoff has been critical of Wikipedia's gender imbalance and has worked with the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery to address it through their annual Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon.

Publius Cornelius Maluginensis Scipio (consular tribune 395 BC)

Publius Cornelius Scipio was an ancient Roman politician. Regarded as the first Scipio, his filiation, P. f M. n, mean that he is the son of a Publius, the son of a Marcus. He may have had the name “Maluginensis” in his name, making him possibly the son of Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, the Consular Tribune of 404 BC and the grandson of Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis, the Consul of 436 BC. He was the Magister Equitum of the dictator Marcus Furius Camillus in 396 BC, and served as Consular Tribune in 395 BC. He may have also served in 394 BC, as an unknown “Publius Cornelius” is known to have served. He had two children, Publius Cornelius Scipio, who was the Magister Equitum of the dictator Lucius Furius Camillus, probably the son of Marcus Furius Camillus, in 350 BC. His other son was Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who served as Consul in 350 BC. He is an ancestor to many Roman politicians, most notably Scipio Africanus.

Spring Valley Township Bridge No. E-31

Spring Valley Township Bridge No. E-31 is a historic bridge in rural Turner County, South Dakota, carrying 447th Avenue across unnamed stream west of Viborg. Built in 1938, it was a well-preserved example of a stone bridge built for the county with funding from the Works Progress Administration. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
Description and history.
Spring Valley Township Bridge No. E-31 is located in a rural setting of southwestern Turner County, on 447th Avenue between 290th and 291st Streets, about west of Viborg. It is a three-arch stone structure, built out of native granite and quartzite, mostly of rubblestone with shaped voussoirs. Each arch spans about and rises about . The spandrel walls rise to form low parapets on the sides, topped with concrete coping and extended to flared wing walls. One of the central piers has had its base reinforced by concrete blocks.
This bridge is one of 180 stone arch bridges built in Turner County as part of New Deal-era federal jobs programs. The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then-conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built in 1938 by a county crew to a standardized state design.

Elsie Bates-Freund

Elsie Mari Bates Freund (1912–2001) was a studio art jeweler, watercolorist, and textile artist. She and her husband, Louis Freund, established an art school in Eureka Springs in 1941.
Elsie Bates was born on January 12, 1912, in Taney County, Missouri. She had two sisters. Her father, Ralph C. Bates, who was the superintendent of the game preserve, was of Irish and Cherokee descent. She attended a one-room schoolhouse in Taney County, where the game preserve owner’s daughter encouraged her interest by bringing her books and art supplies. In her teens, Bates boarded with a family in Girard, Kansas, so that she could attend high school. Her parents later moved to Branson, Missouri, and Bates graduated in 1929.
Bates then taught for one year, then she returned to the resort town of Branson and opened a gift shop, where she made trophies by molding live fish in plaster of Paris and using the mold to cast a plaster model of the fish, which she later painted, as well as jewelry that she made out of walnut shells.
In 1936, she met H. Louis Freund, a dashing mural painter touring the Ozark Mountains in a Model T Ford to observe and record a way of life that was fast disappearing. He courted Bates for three years while artist in residence at Hendrix College in Conway. In 1939, he saved $300 and bought Hatchet Hall, a large boarding house in Eureka Springs owned from 1909 to 1911 by the temperance advocate Carry Nation, saving it from being razed and sold for wood.
Bates married Freund in Hatchet Hall on July 6, 1939, and they moved into the old house and turned it into the summer Art School of the Ozarks, which they operated from 1940 to 1951. Her husband taught painting and drawing while she taught classes related to crafts, such as weaving and design. Eureka Springs continues to have a reputation as an artistic hub based on the Freunds' influence.
The Freund school operated only during summers, Elsie was able to study more, taking her first ceramics class at the Wichita Art Association in Kansas. This is where she began to develop a jewelry-making process that combined clay, glass, and later—at the suggestion of a Florida shop owner—silver. Louis named the works “Elsaramics,” but Elsie shortened this to “Elsa,” which she stamped on her jewelry.
In 1957, the national craft outlet America House in New York City accepted Freund’s jewelry, which was advertised in "The New York Times" and "The New Yorker". After nearly seven years, Freund grew weary of filling repeat orders and discontinued the line in 1964. She and her husband went on a five-month Mediterranean tour, using the proceeds from her jewelry sales, and spent some of the time doing research and painting.
While Freund was turning her jewelry into a business, she was also experimenting with tie-dye techniques. Already proficient in watercolor, in 1953, she was accepted into the National Watercolor Society based on a peer review of her work and was the subject for a magazine article on her tie-dye technique. But her jewelry remains her most important work. She is remembered as one of the pioneer studio art jewelers in the United States. This group broke the usual mold by experimenting with modern design and alternative materials—she made jewelry out of clay, glass, and copper and aluminum wire, rejecting the machine and principles of mass production when it was normal to set precious stones in silver and gold. Her painting did not attract as much attention as her jewelry, which was recognized late in her life and is represented in more than a dozen museums in the United States, as well as a half dozen national and international museums in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. She was awarded the State of Arkansas Certificate of Recognition in 1991.
In 1995, Freund moved to Parkway Village, a retirement community in Little Rock. She died on June 14, 2001, and Richard Earl Grimes, chief of the Cherokee nation, conducted her memorial service. A second service was held in Eureka Springs, where she is buried.

Soft Border Patrol

Soft Border Patrol is a Northern Irish mockumentary sitcom in the style of a reality television programme based around the subject of the Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border in a post-Brexit world. It shadows the "Soft Border Patrol", a fictional border agency backed by governments in London, Dublin and Belfast, and the European Commission in Brussels. The title is a play on the desire at the time of writing for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations for there to be a "Soft Border" between the Republic of Ireland and the north. Much of the series was unscripted, with broad ideas given to the cast by the writers.
It was written by the Glasgow-based The Comedy Unit and the first episode was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on 2 March 2018 at 22:35, with episodes two and three following on the 9 and 16 March.

French ship Soleil (1642)

The Soleil was a 38-gun ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, designed by Deviot and constructed by the Dutch shipwright Jan Gron (usually called Jean de Werth in French) at the new state dockyard at Île d'Indret near Nantes. She and her sister "Lune" were two-deckers, with a mixture of bronze guns on both gun decks. 
The "Soleil" took part in the Battle of Orbitello on 14 June 1646, as the flagship of "Chef d'escadre" Marquis de Montigny, and in the Battle of Castellammare on 21/22 December 1647. By 1671 she had been re-armed with 22 x 12-pounders on the lower deck and 14 x 8-pounders on the upper deck. She was renamed "Hercule" on 24 June 1671, then quickly renamed "Marquis" 23 days later. She was condemned on 28 June 1672 and sold in August to be taken to pieces.

Iris Cummins

Iris Ashley Cummins (1894–1968) was the first female engineer to graduate University College Cork (UCC) and was also an international hockey player.
Early life and education.
Cummins was born on 6 June 1894 in Woodville, Glanmire, Co. Cork to William Edward Ashley Cummins (1858–1923), professor of medicine at University College Cork, and Jane Constable Cummins (née Hall). They had five daughters and six sons. Geraldine Cummins was a playwright. Jane Cummins was a squadron officer in the WRAF during the World War II and became a medical doctor. Mary Hearn was a gynaecologist and fellow of the RCPI. Two of her brothers also became doctors; one, N. Marshall Cummins, was involved in setting up the first blood transfusion service in Cork.
Education.
Cummins began to study in UCC in 1912. At that time there were 78 women students out of the 420 students enrolled. She graduated with an engineering degree in 1915. During her time in engineering Cummins was editor of the "Journal of the Engineering Society"
While she was in college, Cummins was on the Ireland hockey team. She earned her first ‘cap’ for hockey in 1914 and lead the college hockey team to victory in the Munster cup. The Irish hockey team toured the US in 1925 with Cummins as the captain. With the team she went to the White House at the invitation of Calvin Coolidge.
Work.
Cummins worked for the Royal Arsenal with the munitions factory at Woolwich, London and then the Vickers factory at nearby Erith as well as in a shipyard in Scotland during the First World War between 1915 and 1916 before returning to Cork. Initially there she found it hard to find work.
In 1924 she founded a private practice in the city and worked there until 1927 at which time she was appointed to the Irish Land Commission in Dublin. She moved to Dublin and although she visited, she never returned to live in Cork.
She retired from the Land Commission in 1954.
In 1927 Cummins became the first woman member of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland.
She was a Council member of the Women's Engineering Society having joined at the organisation's inception. In December 1919, Cummins wrote an encouraging article in the very first edition of the society's "The Woman Engineer" journal. Based on her own Irish university experience, it laid out the practicalities of studies as well as social interactions likely to be encountered by a woman thinking of training as a civil engineer. The following year, she had another article published, this time in the "Practical Engineer" magazine, entitled "The Suitability of Women for the Engineering Industries"
Twenty years later, in 1940, she wrote a lively piece on "Women Engineers Overseas - in Eire" for "The Woman Engineer" journal on her experiences as one of the earliest women engineers in Ireland. In this article, she recounted a tale of encountering the "oldest Inhabitant" of a very rural area, a proud owner of two fine horses, who on discovering "you must be an engineer, so would ye mind mending the electric light in the mare's stable?" 
Death.
She died 30 April 1968 in Dublin

Imaginary Landscape No. 5

Imaginary Landscape No. 5 (sometimes also entitled "Imaginary Landscapes No. 5") is a composition by American composer John Cage and the fifth and final installment in the series of "Imaginary Landscapes". It was composed in 1952.
Composition.
After working on his "Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2)" and his "Music of Changes", Cage's first two works to feature utter indeterminacy, Cage started working with Morton Feldman on graphical scores, which was fairly avant-garde at the time. Fascinated by the idea of detaching himself from the music he was making, he decided to write a piece that used the system in "No. 4", but with recorded music rather than radio broadcasting. This piece was a part of Cage's two contributions to a project entitled "Project for Music for Magnetic Tape", the other one being "Williams Mix", composed in a similar fashion and also presented on graphic paper. However, the piece was to be realized as a tape recording, and not to be broadcast.
With the help of long-time collaborator David Tudor and the technical assistance from Bebe and Louis Barron, Cage realized the composition on January 18, 1952. Cage used mostly jazz recordings to make this piece, which called for 42 recordings, presented as disposed in the score. This work became the basis of a dance piece, entitled "Portrait of a Lady", which premiered in New York in 1952 by Jean Erdman. The score was eventually published by Edition Peters.
Structure.
This piece consist of only one movement and the average duration varies widely from recording to recording. It is scored for 42 recordings disposed in eight tracks in a mixing studio, all of them being re-recorded into tape as disposed in the score. The score itself is a block-grid, wherein each square is meant to be three inches of recording (around 0.2 seconds). The score also indicates the changes in dynamics and includes crescendos and diminuendos. Whereas duration and amplitude are specified in the score, there is no mention from Cage as to what recordings or what type of music should be used for performing the piece. The compositional method was use of the I Ching, creating a chart work with a five to five structure, as in "Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2)".

Prime, Ward &amp; King

Prime, Ward &amp; King was a prominent American investment bank in the 18th and 19th Century based in New York City.
History.
In 1796, Nathaniel Prime organized "Nathaniel Prime, Stock and Commission Broker" at 42 Wall Street where he bought and sold bank stocks. After opening the private bank, he allowed customers to deposit money and then loaned it out.
In 1808, Prime brought in Samuel Ward III as a partner and the firm was renamed Prime &amp; Ward. In 1816, Joseph Sands, Prime's brother-in-law, was made a partner and the firm became Prime, Ward &amp; Sands.
In 1823, Prime met with and, eventually, invited James Gore King became a partner upon his return from England. King, a son of U.S. Senator Rufus King, had previously been affiliated with the firm of King &amp; Gracie, founded in 1818 in Liverpool, England by King and his brother-in-law, Archibald Gracie, Jr. (the son of Archibald Gracie). King wound up the affairs of the house in England, returned to New York and became a partner of the house of Prime, Ward, Sands, King &amp; Company on May 1, 1824, which at the time consisted of Nathaniel Prime, Samuel Ward, Joseph Sands, James G. King and Robert Ray (Prime's son-in-law).
In 1826, after Joseph died the firm was again reorganized as Prime, Ward &amp; King with the previous partners and including Edward Prime, Prime's son. In 1832, Prime retired and was replaced as a co-partner in the firm by his son, Edward. In 1839, Ward died and was replaced by his son Samuel Cutler Ward, who had joined the firm the previous year. In 1844, King's son Archibald Gracie King joined the firm which already included Denning Duer, the son of William Alexander Duer and the elders King's son-in-law. In 1846, King and his family left the firm and started James G. King &amp; Son, which he operated until his death in 1853.
The firm stunned the financial world when it collapsed in September 1847, which some claim was caused by the younger Ward's "excessive speculation in commodities" and caused the bankruptcy of the Ward family.
Services.
Among their biggest clients was Baring Brothers, a British merchant bank based in London that was the world's second oldest merchant bank founded in 1762 and owned by the German-originated Baring family of merchants and bankers.
In 1823, Baring bought Erie Canal bonds through the firm, causing other international investors to do the same. The success of the Canal bonds caused the firm to take the lead in financing American expansion out west.
After the financial crisis of 1836 to 1837, the Bank of England in an effort to assist New York City banks in resuming specie payment, confided a loan of almost 5 million dollars of gold to the firm which was considered a remarkable sign of confidence.
Timeline.
The firm was known by various names throughout its existence, including:

Lyne Lapointe

Lyne Lapointe (born 1957) is a French-Canadian artist. Her work ranges from site-specific installations (1981–1995), found-objects, drawings, and paintings, with focuses on art history, museology, botany, and feminism. She has exhibited extensively in Montreal, Quebec, and New York City, New York, and across Canada. She now lives and works in Mansonville, Quebec.
Early life.
She was born in Montreal, Quèbec. Lapointe studied art history and visual arts at Old Montreal and Rosemont colleges, and in 1978 attained a Bachelor of Fine Art at Carleton University of Ottawa. 
Career.
Collaboration with Martha Fleming (1981-1995).
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Lapointe lived and worked in Montreal with collaborative partner Martha Fleming. The two were together from 1981-1995.
Lapointe and Fleming’s collaborations were rooted in the politics of radical feminism, marginalization, and museum practices. Their works combined site-specific histories, art historical references, female sexuality and desire, and botany, in order to critically analyze social politics. The two ended their relationship in 1995.
Site-Specific Installation.
From 1981-1995 Lapointe and Fleming executed several site-specific installations in politically charged architectural and abandoned buildings across Montreal, New York City, and Sao Paulo. Addressing systemic marginalization with museum and gallery practices through a feminist lens, these installations engaged the social issues historically embedded at such sites. (such as Casa Yaya, home of 1887 Dona Sebastiana de Mello Freire; These The Pearls, London; Duda, The Library in Emir Mohammed Park, Madrid; La Donna Deliquenta, Vaudeville Theatre, Montreal).
Studiolo.
In 1997, The Musee d’Art Contemporain exhibited a retrospective for Lapointe and Fleming titled, "Studiolo". The exhibit marked their 15-year collaboration, showcasing their polemic research and creative processes. Complementary to the retrospective was a publication, also "Studiolo", which represented the political and philosophical frameworks from which they worked. The exhibit was subsequently exhibited at the Art Gallery of Windsor in 1998, invited by curator (at the time) Helga Pakasaar.
1995-.
"La Perle", Carlton University.
In 2007, Carlton University Art Gallery held a solo exhibition for Lapointe titled, "La Perle". The exhibit engaged Lapointe’s interest of sound, optics, and museum history, with 23 individual works of painting, drawings, and found-objects. The installation of works, drawn from images of botany, medical, art-historical sources and encyclopedias, were intended to challenge practices of museology and display methods.
Selected works: La Pierre Patiente.
In 2011, the Pierre-Francois Oulette Art Contemporain exhibited 7 selected paintings from Lapointe’s series "La Pierre Patiente" (The Patient Stone). Lapointe used acupuncture needles, formally intended to reestablish a human internal balance of energy, to address the tension between humans’ link to the environment and other species. These works were painted on glass with phosphorescent pigments (a technique seen in earlier works), to suggest the shift between light and darkness, and the fragility of memory and disembodiment.
Further exhibitions.
In 2021, she was one of the participants in John Greyson's experimental short documentary film "International Dawn Chorus Day".
Recognition.
Her work is collected in Canadian art institutes. She is represented by Roger Bellemare/Christian Lambert Gallery in Montreal, and has artworks at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City.

Vulvar tumors

Vulvar tumors are those neoplasms of the vulva. Vulvar and vaginal neoplasms make up a small percentage (3%) of female genital cancers. They can be benign or malignant (vulvar cancer). Vulvar neoplasms are divided into cystic or solid lesions and other mixed types. Vulvar cancers are those malignant neoplasms that originate from vulvar epithelium, while vulvar sarcomas develop from non-epithelial cells such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Epithelial and mesenchymal tissue are the origin of vulvar tumors.
Malignant vulvar neoplasms makes up 6% of all reproductive organ cancer and 0.7% of the total cancers in women in the United States. One out of every 333 women will develop vulvar cancer. In the United States, vulvar cancer accounts for nearly 6% of cancers of the female reproductive organs and 0.7% of all cancers in women. In 2018, there will be 6,190 women diagnosed with cancer of the vulva with 1,200 women dying from it. Malignant vulvar tumors can develop in the inner edges of the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris or in the Bartholin glands. Research in preventing vulvar cancers includes investigations into the use of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, drug treatments, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and lymph node mapping.

The Hailu dialect (; Hailu Hakka Romanization System: hoi´ liug` kiong`), also known as the Hoiluk dialect or Hailu Hakka (), is a dialect of Hakka Chinese that originated in Shanwei, Guangdong. It is also the second most common dialect of Hakka spoken in Taiwan.
Classification.
The first edition of the "Language Atlas of China" places the Hakka dialects spoken in Haifeng and Lufeng into the Xin–Hui cluster () of the Yue–Tai subgroup () of Hakka. In the second edition, it is given its own subgroup known as the Hai–Lu subgroup () separate from the Yue–Tai subgroup.
Chang Song-hing and Zhuang Chusheng propose that it should be grouped as the Hai–Lu cluster () of the Mei–Shao subgroup ().
Distribution.
In China, the Hailu dialect is spoken in Shanwei, Guangdong, particularly in Haifeng, Lufeng, and Luhe. As of 2012, there are around 1.18 million speakers of the dialect in these three areas.
In Taiwan, it is spoken in Hsinchu County (Xinfeng, Xinpu, Hukou, Qionglin, Hengshan, Guanxi, Beipu, Baoshan, Emei, and Zhudong), Hsinchu City (Xiangshan and Xinfeng), Taoyuan (mostly in Guanyin, Xinwu, and Yangmei; also pockets in Pingzhen, Zhongli, and Longtan), Hualien County (Ji'an, Shoufeng, Guangfu, Yuli, Ruisui, and Fenglin), and Miaoli County (Toufen, Sanwan, Nanzhuang, Xihu, Houlong, Zaoqiao, Tongxiao, and Tongluo). In 2013, 41.5% of Hakka people in Taiwan were reported to be able to communicate in the Hailu dialect.
In Indonesia, it is widely spoken in northern West Kalimantan, including Singkawang, Sambas, and Pemangkat.
Phonology.
Tones.

Giorgio Pasquali

Giorgio Pasquali (29 April 1885, Rome9 July 1952, Belluno) was an Italian classical scholar who made a fundamental contribution to the field of textual criticism.
He studied classical philology at La Sapienza University of Rome, graduating in 1907 with a dissertation entitled "La commedia mitologica e i suoi precedenti nella letteratura greca" ("Mythological comedy and its precedents in Greek literature"). In 1908 and 1909 he continued his studies in Basel and Göttingen. He went on to teach in Rome, Messina, Göttingen and Florence, where he became full professor of Greek literature in 1924, before occupying the chair of Greek and that of Latin literature. In 1925 he signed the "Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals". From 1931 onwards he also taught at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. He received various honours, including an honorary degree from the University of Göttingen (1937) and being elected to the Royal Academy of Italy (1942).
Contribution to textual criticism.
Pasquali's greatest claim to fame is the book "Storia della tradizione e critica del testo" ("History of the tradition and textual criticism"). It was born as a reaction to "Textkritik" by Paul Maas, of which Pasquali first wrote a long review that appeared in several instalments in the journal "Gnomon". His book, which came out in 1934, complements the work of Maas rather than refuting it. A thoroughly revised second edition appeared in 1952, the year of Pasquali's death. The book has not been translated into English.
The book makes several major contributions to textual criticism, and especially to its sub-field of stemmatics. Pasquali concentrates on ancient Greek and Latin texts, which we know mostly through manuscript copies written in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance. Before him, scholars had concentrated on abstract relationships between the manuscripts and drew up geometric "stemmata codicum" or "manuscript family trees"; Pasquali shows the benefit of seeing the transmission of a text as a historical process. He also studies special cases of textual transmissions, for example where the manuscripts contain different versions of the same passages, both (or all) of them written by the author; and where anomalous sources such as collations (textual notes) by humanists conserve readings from lost manuscripts. He shows that a fairly recent manuscript may conserve valuable textual variants, if it goes back to a valuable lost source, an idea that is expressed in the maxim "recentiores non deteriores".

Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell

Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell was a New York brokerage based on Broadway in the 1920s. It was a member of the Consolidated Stock Exchange, before failing on April 29, 1922. The failure resulted in a highly publicized lawsuit over whether the firm committed mail fraud and bucketing before failing.
History.
Founding and failure.
The brokerage firm was founded in 1920 in New York. According to records, as early as November 21, 1921, Consolidated had discussed the firm's methods, as it was known for bucketing.
As of 1922, it was based at 42 Broadway and 30 East 42nd Street, and were members of the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York. Firm members included D. C. Raynor, E. H. Truesdell, and B. J. Nicholas. The firm soon ran into financial difficulties. In November 1923 at the bankruptcy hearing, speculator Louis B. Appleton told that he and his brother Charles put up $50,000 before the failure as an advance to the firm, to help keep it afloat.
The firm failed on April 29, 1922. In October 1923, testimony about the firm revealed that it failed in April 1922 for $4,000,000, and that the committee of the Consolidated Exchange had been aware of its failing condition six weeks before that. The failure amount was in 1924 reported as "more than $2,000,000."
Bucketing and fraud charges.
In December 1923, De Witt C. Raynor was indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in connection with the failure, after testifying that May. When the hearing resumed the following June, he had disappeared, failing to answer to a subpoena. He was still missing by July 1923, when he should have surrendered for his arrest. On January 23, 1924, it was revealed after an examination of the books that Raynor, Nicholas Truesdell owed $1,250,000 to be divided among 2,500 customers, and had $80,000 in assets. That day, several curb brokers were called in to testify on their dealings with the firm's check history. On February 1, 1924, De Witt Raynor walked into the office of the United States Marshal in Havana and surrendered himself, disclaiming any voluntary violation of the law. On November 6, 1924, De Witt C. Raynor plead guilty before a federal judge on charges of conspiracy and using the mails to defraud. Other co-defendants at the time included William Silkworth, Louis Gilbough of Consolidated, Blaine J. Nicholas and Earl H. Truesdell, and several others including Peter Owens, office manager of the Raynor firm. Lawyer Peter McCoy was prosecutor.
On November 29, 1924, Silkworth and five others also found guilty of bucketing, with Silkworth convicted of mail fraud relating to his brokerage and Raynor, Nicholas and Truesdell in 1922. During the appeal process, McCoy gave testimony before the Circuit Court of Appeals that Raynor, Nicholas &amp; Truesdell had engaged in extensive bucketing operations since its founding late 1920. McCoy further testified that Silkworth had provided the firm's bucketing operations with the protection of Consolidated. The Judge ruled against the motion raised by defendants, which was that bucketing did not have a Federal statute against it at the time, and ruled in favor of McCoy on February 1, 1926 with the November conviction upheld. Silkworth served three months of a year sentence in 1926, with other brokers also serving time.

TAZ 90

The TAZ 90 (TarnAnZug in German and TASS 90 in French) is the camouflage patterns for current standard issue battledress and service dress uniform of the Swiss Armed Forces.
History.
The TAZ 90 was issued to the Swiss military in 1993 after the TAZ 83 had been phased out of service. ETH Zurich played a role in its creation, since the pattern was made to suit Swiss environment.
Pattern.
The four-colour pattern consists of tan, brown, green and black and is a development of the "Taz 57" and "Taz 83" (the "Alpenflage") patterns which it replaced in the early 1990s. Even so, the pattern is based on the alpenflage, but with the deletion of the white spots and the red colour found in the alpenflage, along with minor changes. 
Variants.
Taz 90/06.
In 2006, the Taz was changed to include Velcro insignia and Velcro name tabs (Taz 90/06).
Desert.
A desert variant for Swiss troops working abroad in peacekeeping operations.
Replacement.
A slightly altered new MultiCam design ("Multiumfeldtarnmuster 16") will be introduced in 2022. The cost for its development is around CHF 250 million to replace the Taz 90/06.

Vanessa Kwan

Vanessa Kwan is an art curator based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Background.
Curatorial.
Kwan's curatorial work includes positions held at the Richmond Art Gallery, British Columbia, grunt gallery, Vancouver and the Vancouver Art Gallery. According to Kwan, her role as a curator often "consists of producing artist projects that engage with the community, are site-specific, and are generally not situated inside the gallery." Kwan elaborates that she interested in "art practices that are not focused solely on the gallery, but might be produced elsewhere."
Kwan is a member of Other Sights for Artist's Projects, a public art collective in Vancouver.
In addition to these artistic and curatorial activities, Kwan works closely with Vancouver-based artists, Hannah Jickling and Helen Reed on Big Rock Candy Mountain, a project initiated in early 2015.
Artistic Practice.
Recently, Kwan created "Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver", a public art work for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In 2013, Kwan created an interactive piece entitled "Everything Between Open and Closed", a work that was temporarily sited at the Bob Prittie Burnaby Public Library as a part of its KIOSK event. For that project, the artist occupied the kiosk for two weeks creating signs that were posted on the walls of the kiosk, as a means of interacting with the community space.
Residencies.
In 2017, Kwan completed a post residency in Visual + Digital Arts at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Banff, Calgary, and received the Post Residency Award from the Banff Centre for Residency.

Henry Hodges Parker

Henry Hodges Parker (March 2, 1834 – September 7, 1927) was the fourth Kahu (pastor) of Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu. He served in that position 54 years, the longest of any Kahu in its history. Fluent in the Hawaiian language, he was a friend and pastor to Native Hawaiians, which included several decades of the Hawaiian monarchy.
Background.
Born March 2, 1834 in Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, he was the oldest of four children, and the only son, of missionaries Benjamin Wyman Parker (1803–1877) and Mary Elizabeth Barker Parker (1805–1907). They were part of the Sixth Company of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions that had been sent to Nuku Hiva in 1833. The island was under civil unrest at the time, and the mission was aborted within months. The missionaries arrived back in Honolulu on May 12, 1834.
The Parkers were assigned to Kaneohe, where Henry and his sisters Mary, Harriet and Caroline grew up. He studied at the Royal School under the tutelage of Edward Griffin Beckwith, and later was enrolled in classes at Punahou School under Daniel Dole and William Harrison Rice. After graduation, he spent two years as an instructor at Lahainaluna High School on Maui.
Ministry.
The current Kawaiahaʻo Church was constructed between 1836 and 1842. The church as a congregation had existed since Hiram Bingham arrived in 1820, and began meetings adjacent to his thatched hut. Other replacement structures were built in the same location before the stone church was erected, and had been a church home for royalty since Queen Kaʻahumanu accepted Christianity in 1824. Various names for the church have included "the Stone Church", "First Native Hawaiian church", "the Mission Church", "the Native Church" and "the First Native Church at Kawaihao in Honolulu".
Known to Hawaiians as "Paleka opio" (the younger Parker), he grew up fluent in the Hawaiian language. Parker was trained in the ministry as an associate pastor at Kawaiahaʻo Church under Rev. Ephraim Weston Clark, who was working on an updated version of the Hawaiian Bible. When Clark resigned from the pulpit to pursue that goal, Parker was ordained as Kahu (pastor) of Kawaiahaʻo Church on June 28, 1863. "The Pacific Commercial Advertiser" commented on his ordination, "His perfect acquisition of the native language, and the rare faculty he possesses of rendering foreign ideas and sentiments clear, attractive and intelligible to the native mind, has made him a popular speaker with them, and we hope he may prove equally useful as a pastor." Kamehameha V, the last Aliʻi to reign under that name, looked favorably upon missionaries, and his viewpoint was that Parker's motivations were towards the well- being of the Hawaiian people.
King Lunalilo 1873 coronation took place in Kawaiahaʻo Church, with Parker offering the opening prayer at the ceremony. When Lunalilo died in 1874, Parker officiated in the Hawaiian language at the funeral service in ʻIolani Palace. Although Queen Emma had helped establish the Church of Hawaii, upon her 1885 death, King Kalākaua requested Parker deliver the Hawaiian language eulogy at her funeral. Kalākaua was also a member of the Church of Hawaii; and while Parker did not deliver his eulogy, he was among the members of the official clergy representation at the funeral. When Hawaii's last monarch Liliʻuokalani died in 1917, Parker and Leopold Kroll of the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew were notified so church bells could toll 79 times, her age at death. Her body lay in state at Kawaiahaʻo Church. Parker delivered the Hawaiian language eulogy at her funeral.
A celebration of his ministerial role was held at Kawaiahaʻo on the 40th anniversary of his ordination. Very little mention was made of the royalty he had ministered to, but it was rather a recognition of his labors to hundreds of congregants who received his services over the decades.
Retirement and final years.
In 1912, he performed the marriage of his congregant Alice Rosehill to Maui sheriff Peter Noa Kahokuoluna . The ceremony took place in Parker's home. A few years later, Alice would become the first woman minister ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association and, during her life, the only woman minister of the gospel in the Territory of Hawaii.
Parker retired as an active minister on January 27, 1918, five months short of 55 years as pastor of Kawaiahaʻo Church. His last act as their Kahu was to baptize two babies. Akaiko Akana was called to succeed Parker in the pulpit.
He devoted the next several years of his life to revising "A Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language", originally published in 1865 by Hawaii Supreme Court judge Lorrin Andrews. Reviewer Herbert W. Williams in 1926 did not see the publication as an improvement over the original. However, historian Ethel Moseley Damon noted in 1945 that Parker's revised edition was still used as a standard.
Parker never married. When he died in 1927 at age 93, his sister Harriet was the only remaining member of his immediate family. His father, Benjamin, died March 23, 1877 and was the first of the family to be buried in the Mission Cemetery at Kawaiahaʻo. His mother lived to age 102, dying in 1907. Sisters Mary and Caroline both died in 1925. All were buried in the Mission Cemetery, except for his sister Harriet who was buried at Kawaiahaʻo Church Cemetery after her 1929 death.

1987 UK Athletics Championships

The 1987 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Moorways Stadium, Derby. It was the first time that the English city hosted the event. The men's 10,000 metres was held at the Gateshead International Stadium, while the women's event was dropped entirely.
It was the eleventh edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1987 AAA Championships.
Fatima Whitbread won her seventh consecutive women's javelin throw UK title, while shot putter Judy Oakes won a fourth straight title and men's javelin athlete Mick Hill his third. Other athletes to defend their 1986 titles were Max Robertson (400 m hurdles), Paula Dunn (100 m), Lisa Langford (racewalk) and Diana Davies (high jump). Dunn, with her sprint double, was the only athlete to win two UK titles that year, though Kim Hagger managed to be runner-up in both 100 m hurdles and long jump events.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1987 World Championships in Athletics. Women's UK champion Fatima Whitbread won the world title, as she had in 1983. Men's 100 m champion Linford Christie was the only other UK champion to reach the podium, though several British athletes not present at the UK event did so.

John Rowland Fothergill (1876–1957) was an English innkeeper and entrepreneur, described as a "pioneer amateur innkeeper" in "Who's Who".
Biography.
John Rowland Fothergill was born in Kent in 1876, his family originating from Westmorland and Caerleon. He studied at St John's College, Oxford, the Slade School of Fine Art and the London School of Architecture. His contemporaries at the Slade included Augustus John and William Rothenstein.
In 1898, Fothergill and Rothenstein opened the Carfax Gallery on 24 Bury Street, St James's with managerial assistance from Arthur Clifton and Robert Sickert (brother of Walter Sickert) and financial support from Edward Perry Warren. The gallery became Walter Sickert's chief dealer in England. William Bruce Ellis Ranken held his first exhibition at the gallery. Fothergill subsequently became one of Warren's biographers. 
Fothergill bought a large Tudor oak table for £25 that was installed in the dining room at Warren's home, Lewes House. Upon Warren's death, it sold for £2,100 (£ in ). Fothergill was left £20,000 (£ in ) by Warren. His book, "Confessions of an Innkeeper" was dedicated to Warren's partner and main beneficiary.
In 1922, Fothergill bought the Spread Eagle Hotel in Thame and turned it into a success through the decade before it closed in 1931. The pub was regularly visited by Evelyn Waugh and associates, and is mentioned in "Brideshead Revisited". Waugh gave Fothergill a copy of his first novel, "Decline and Fall", in which he wrote, "John Fothergill, Oxford's only civilizing influence." Fothergill hid the copy in the inn's toilet to avoid theft. Harold Acton also visited the inn and namechecked Fothergill in his memoirs, "Memoirs of an Aesthete". Fothergill praised Acton's novel, "Humdrum", saying that it "might have been written by the young Wilde." Fothergill's book, "My Three Inns" recommends Acton's autobiography at the end. 
Following the Spread Eagle, Fothergill managed the Royal Ascot Hotel and the Three Swans at Market Harborough. He gravitated around the Bright Young Things group, in the meaning that this crowd attended the venues managed by Fothergill. He was praised for his cooking and innkeeping skills that helped to improve overall dining standards in Britain. 
Fothergill was a close friend of Robbie Ross and Reginald Turner, and met Oscar Wilde aged 19. Wilde grew fond of him, and presented Fothergill with an inscribed copy of "The Ballad of Reading Gaol", following Wilde's release from prison in 1897.

Mary Dingman

Mary Dingman (April 9, 1875 – March 21, 1961) was an American social and peace activist, who served as a staff member of the YWCA USA and World YWCA to develop programs to improve the working conditions of women and children in the workforce. Traveling throughout the world, beginning in 1917, she organized programs in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In 1931, she joined the pacifist movement and serve as chair of the Peace and Disarmament Committee of the Women's International Organisations for a decade. Turning her attention to the need for world cooperation, she pressed for the formalization of the United Nations, serving as a delegate to the first United Nations conference. She was employed as a child welfare advocate by the UN from 1948 until her retirement in 1954.
Early life.
Mary Agnes Dingman was born on April 9, 1875 in Newark, New Jersey to Nettie Clyde (née Beveridge) and James Alva Dingman. She was the oldest child in the large family which moved to the village of Spring Valley, New York before her fifth birthday. Her father, originally from Canada was a physician and a devout Methodist, who encouraged his children toward humanitarian service, inspiring Dingman and her younger sister, Helen, in their careers. Dingman was a student at Northfield Seminary in Northfield, Massachusetts and after graduating in 1895, entered the normal school at New Paltz, New York. Earning her teaching certificate in 1899, she continued her education at Teachers College, Columbia University, attaining her bachelor's degree in 1910.
Career.
Upon completion of her education, Dingman moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts, where she was employed at Dana Hall School, as an economics and history teacher from 1910 to 1914. In 1914, she was hired by the YWCA USA to coordinate assistance programs for the Industrial Department, which aided women working in factories. In 1917, she was selected to go to France and assist with surveying and creating a plan to address the concerns of women working in munitions factories. While the women, largely made up of refugees, were provided with food and lodging by the French War Department, they had few conveniences. Dingman established fifteen "Foyers des Allies", or social centers, to provide the women workers with books, writing materials and a communal area in which to socialize when they were not working. At the end of World War I, Dingman became responsible for establishing YWCA clubs throughout Belgium and France. Over the next several years, she established organizations in over twenty locations. She was awarded the "Adolphe Max Bourgmestre de Bruxelles" Medal by Belgium and in 1919 was honored by the French government with the "Jeanne D'Arc Liberatrice du Territoire" and "La Victoire Restaure le Droit" plaques for her service.
In 1921, Dingman moved to London and became the Chief Industrial Secretary of the World YWCA. In 1923, she went to China to establish protocols for the Far East and remained there for two years. She found conditions in the textile industry similar to those which had existed in England during the Industrial Revolution, with low wages, unsafe conditions, and a labor force dominated by women and children. Working with a group of women and the Shanghai Municipal Council, regulations were drafted to change the existing labor laws, but they were not adopted because of clashes between the Kuomintang and the civil authorities. In 1930, when the World YWCA relocated to Geneva, Dingman moved to Switzerland and the following year began to work with pacifist organizations. Over the course of her fourteen years as Secretary, she traveled to more than forty countries throughout Australia and New Zealand, East Asia and Europe, creating educational programs for women factory workers. She also trained YWCA personnel to oversee the initiatives, which were developed after analyzing each country's labor regulations and safety measures.
The World YWCA, offered space in its Geneva headquarters to a newly formed umbrella organization, the Peace and Disarmament Committee of the Women's International Organisations (PDCWIO) in 1931 and provided clerical assistance for the committee through Evelyn Beresford Fox. Fox would become Dingman's colleague, as well as her life-long companion. Dingman was elected to head the PCDWIO and represented the organization at the World Disarmament Conference held in 1932. In 1935, she was re-elected to the presidency and resigned her post with the YWCA. She spoke at the League of Nations in 1936 and traveled widely as a lecturer on disarmament. In December 1939, she was arrested in Italy and held without charge for twenty-four hours while US officials sought her release.
With the outbreak of World War II, Dingman returned to the United States in 1939, settling in Berea, Kentucky, near her sisters Helen and Jeanette, mother of future Nobel Prize winner, John B. Fenn. She left the presidency of the PDCWIO, though she continued to lecture and tour, speaking on pacifism and improving international relations on behalf of the YWCA. Beginning in 1944, she worked to establish the United Nations, having advocated for an international body to replace the League of Nations since 1941. As a field worker for the Women's Action Committee for Victory and Lasting Peace, she lectured to bring public awareness for the organization and advocating for congressional authorization. She attended the inaugural conference of the World Federation of United Nations Associations in 1946 and in 1948 was appointed a consultant by the UN to work on behalf of the International Union for Child Welfare. She worked for the UN until 1954, when she officially retired.
Death and legacy.
Dingman died on March 21, 1961 in Berea, Kentucky. Her papers form a collection in the Schlesinger Library of the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University.

Martha Fleming

Martha Fleming is a museum professional and academic, working primarily in the intersecting fields of history of science, museology and history of collections. She has held research, teaching and leadership positions in both museums and universities in the United Kingdom, where she has lived since 1996. She has also held posts in university museums and collections in Denmark and in Germany. She lived and worked in Montreal, Québec, from 1981 until 1996, when she moved to London, England.
Much of her research is practice-based, translating into exhibitions, strategic development instruments, and pedagogical programmes. This approach derives from her earlier career (1980-1995) as an artist and art critic, where she developed a lasting interest in interdisciplinary methodologies integrating research and practice. She also publishes her research in scholarly contexts such as History of Science and Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press.
Early life.
Fleming was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on 2 October 1958, the daughter of Canadian graphic designer Allan Fleming (1929-1977) and publishing executive Nancy Fleming (1931-2008). Her brother is the furniture designer Peter Robb Fleming. Her sister is the Chef and Culinary Arts Professor, Susannah Jane Fleming. The siblings’ godparents were the poet Richard Outram and the artist Barbara Howard. The family home was a hub for Canadian creative professionals in the 1960s and 1970s, and was well appointed with furnishings both traditional and modernist, antiques, art and an extensive book collection. Fleming’s childhood took place in this expansive cultural context.
Fleming’s father experienced stress-related health challenges while working as Vice President and Executive Art Director for MacLaren Advertising (now McCann Worldgroup) from 1963 to 1968. Her parents separated in 1976, and her father died shortly thereafter in 1977.
Fleming worked for rare book sellers in Toronto on leaving school in 1974, including Monk Bretton Books and the Albert Britnell Book Shop. At the suggestion of her godfather, Fleming concurrently audited courses in English Literature at the University of Toronto, including lectures by Northrop Frye on the narrative structure of the Bible, lectures which were later published posthumously.
Higher Education.
Fleming was awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship in 1997 to pursue a MA (Master of Arts) in The History of the Book at the School of Advanced Study of University of London. Fleming later received her PhD, titled "From Le Musee des Sciences to the Sciences Museum: Fifteen Years of Evolving Methodologies in the Art and Science Interface" from the School of Art, Architecture and Design of Leeds Metropolitan University.
Artistic career.
In her early artistic career, Fleming was an involved in various artist-run centres, and authored art criticism and theoretical articles for publications such as ArtForum, Open Letter, and Block, among others.
Collaboration with Lyne Lapointe.
In 1981, Fleming established both a romantic and collaborative relationship with French-Canadian artist Lyne Lapointe. The couple lived together in Montreal, Quebec, where from their studio base they produced internationally a substantial body of research-intensive site-specific installations that were mainly self-organised, forging a deep and intersectional feminist aesthetics. Their hybrid practice was informed by, and contributed to, emerging artforms at the time such as installation, site-specificity, conceptual art, institutional critique, representational critique, readymades (found-objects), and appropriation. The projects which occupied abandoned architectures constituted forms of urban activism, inscribing critical thinking in marginal spaces in cities, and refuting the privatization of public space. Each Fleming and Lapointe project addressed a specific nexus of epistemic and political concern, addressing complex social issues historically embedded or metaphorically present at such sites.
Large scale site-specific installation projects by Fleming &amp; Lapointe.
La Donna Delinquenta refers to Cesare Lombroso's 1893 book, "The Female Offender", an early and influential criminological treatise profiling prostitutes, immigrants and poor people in order for police to identify prospective criminals.
In December 1989, Fleming and Lapointe held their first collaborative exhibition in a museum setting, titled, "Eat Me/Drink Me/Love Me", at The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. The title and exhibition is a response to poet Christina Rosetti’s 19th century allegorical poem "Goblin Market", which explores themes of feminine temptation, redemption, and conflicts between virtue and sensual pleasure, in a pastoral setting. "Eat Me/Drink Me/Love Me", transformed the Museum’s gallery in to a space of a domestic yet nature-rooted environment, with found objects, materials from the natural world, and other architectural elements. Together, these elements transfused the themes of emotional and sexual possibilities or restrictions for women, including a homoerotic twist, inspired by "Goblin Market."
At the end of their 15-year relationship in 1995, Fleming and Lapointe had a retrospective, titled "Studiolo", incorporating the bulk of research, processes, and discursive and creative projects that they shared. The show was exhibited at the Museum d’Art Contemporain in 1997, and later at the Art Gallery of Windsor 1998 invited by curator at the time, Helga Pakasaar. Accompanied with the exhibition was an associated book, also titled "Studiolo". The book showcases the philosophical, historical, and aesthetic frameworks associated to the exhibition, and is located in Artextes Editions of 1997.
Academic and Museum Career.
In 1996, Fleming moved to London, England. While her formative years collaborating with Lapointe still greatly influenced her later work, her relocation to the UK enabled her to develop her practice further in interdisciplinary research fields, as she participated extensively in research projects at several major UK museums and universities. Fleming has specialised in the design, creation and management of research projects and centres which conjoin humanities disciplines (often in university settings) with museum and collection institutions. Fleming has furthermore lectured, edited, and published in various contexts, including that of lectureships, scholarly journals, and art journals. Since the beginning of 2000s, Fleming has been the recipient of several grants, and has been involved in several major interdisciplinary research projects.
Teaching.
Fleming has taught in universities and in museum-university partnerships, most notably as inaugural Programme Director of the Centre for Collections Based Research at the University of Reading (2013-2016). Her earlier teaching career includes positions at Concordia University (Montreal), where she taught critical theory and studio practice, and Vermont College of Fine Arts (Montpellier), as well as at Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge) and Camberwell College of Art (London). She has supervised and trained doctoral and post-doctoral research students variously at the University of Copenhagen's Medical Museion (2006-2009); the Materials Library of King's College London (2007-2010); the Centre for Collections Based Research University of Reading; and at the Forschungskolleg "Wissen | Ausstellen" of the University of Göttingen.
Research Positions.
Fleming has a particular interest in museology and museum practices, including the histories of collections and the ways in which these intersect with histories of knowledge production and global colonial histories.
Museum Exhibitions post-1996.
Held at the Science Museum of London, England, Fleming’s exhibition "Atomism and Animism" is an amalgamation of scientific objects of the Cartesian Enlightenment period, distributed in juxtaposing displays across the museum.  In a similar light to the collaborative installation "La Musee de Sciences" with Lapointe in 1984, the displays created a reflective and critical response to museum practices which reestablished new and multiple orderings of scientific tropes and meanings.
Other museum exhibition and project collaborations include "Split + Splice" at the Medical Museion of the University of Copenhagen (2008-2009); and "You are Here: The Design of Information", at the Design Museum in London.

Elizabeth Vander Zaag

Elizabeth Vander Zaag (born 21 June 1952) is a Canadian media artist, writer, and entrepreneur who has been working in video and computer arts since the 1970s. She is based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Vander Zaag is considered a pioneer of digital media. 
Her work has been exhibited internationally and included in exhibitions such as "c.1983" that examine the history of video art.
Life and education.
Elizabeth Vander Zaag was born in Alliston, Ontario in 1952. She received a B.A. in English and film from the University of Western Ontario. 
She also studied creative electronics at Fanshawe College in London, Ontario.
After moving to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1974, Vander Zaag briefly studied computer arts at Simon Fraser University in nearby Burnaby, British Columbia.
Between 1977 and 1980 Vander Zaag created the "Digit Series", a videotape series that was featured on the cable television program "The Gina Show" by producer John Anderson. The "Digit Series" explored both gender and technology. The "Digit Series" has been included in exhibitions such as the "International Symposium on Electronic Art" in 2015.
In 1981 Elizabeth Vander Zaag produced "Thru the Holes", a short video in which the fragmentation of the video screen was used as a filter for human presence. 
This and other video works by Vander Zaag from the 1980-1990s are distributed by Video Out and V/Tape.
"Thru the Holes" has been included in a number of retrospective exhibitions.
"SyntheticSound: An Experimental Music/Video Retrospective" (2016) examined experimental video and music from the 1970s onward. It was curated by Alan Kollins for the transmediale/CTM Vorspiel festival in 2016 and screened in both Canada and Germany. Vander Zaag's work is included to illustrate experimentation with video processing occurring in the 1980s. 
"c.1983" (2012) examined the development of video art, and the ways in which artists such as Vander Zaag "critiqued the commodification of the art object through the expansion of the powers and capacities of the photographic image."
Vander Zaag's work "Hot Chicks on TV" (1986) was included in the exhibition "", curated by Susan Ditta at the National Gallery of Canada in 1989. There it was discussed in the context of women's history, representations of the female body, and relationship of the personal to the political.
In 2000, Elizabeth Vander Zaag's voice interactive installation "Talk Nice" appeared at the Banff Centre before traveling in Canada and to Seoul, Korea, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Paris.
In 2007, she received her master's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of British Columbia. Her graduate thesis, "Mother Tongue : a study of participant affect in an interactive installation," combines research in linguistics and human–computer interaction to further her understanding of the academic context of her interactive speech installations. Along with her graduate thesis, Vander Zaag produced an interactive video installation entitled "Speaking Mother Tongues" (2007).
In 2011, Vander Zaag became the CEO of Mermaid Power Corporation. Mermaid Power has since merged with Neptune Wave, where Vander Zaag is now the CFO. 
She has also managed companies such as Front Media Ltd, CougarDate.com, Ross House Holdings Ltd. She is the director of North Arm Holdings Ltd.

Cheyanne turions

Cheyanne Turions is a Canadian art curator, artist, and writer.
Biography.
Cheyanne Turions was born in High Prairie, Alberta.
Turions studied philosophy at the University of British Columbia before pursuing an MA in Visual Studies from the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design at the University of Toronto. While a student in Toronto she was awarded the 2014 Award for Emerging Curator of Contemporary Canadian Art. At the time of, award jury member Daina Augaitis explained that turions' "curatorial vision stands out for being highly considered and articulated, as well as being relevant, provocative, risky and ambitious."
Turions is currently the curator at SFU Galleries and was previously the Director of Education and Public Programs at the Vancouver Art Gallery where she curated "FUSE: A Conjuring". Previously she was the Artistic Director for Trinity Square Video and an independent writer and curator based in Toronto, Canada. She has worked on the Wood Land School project with Duane Linklater, Tanya Lukin Linklater, and Walter Scott at the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art. The collaboration included a symposium that occurred at Or Gallery in 2016.
Controversy.
According to the March 24, 2021 Vancouver Sun article, "Cheyanne Turions, a curator at SFU galleries, was outed as a “pretendian” last week after @nomoreredface published a Twitter thread that included screenshots of grants that Turions received from the Canada Council that were intended for Aboriginal curators, and worth $73,000, and another for $30,000 from the Ontario Arts Council". She was named in a subsequent article by Amy Fung published by Hyperallergic, titled "Who Bears the Steep Costs of Ethnic Fraud?" which notes, "Ingrained racism has allowed predominantly White institutions to materially benefit from Indigeneity, especially in an era of reconciliation, by preferring to work with “Indigenous” people who look, act, and think like them, because in reality they are them".
In a subsequent blogpost, Turions stated that genealogical research had disproved her family's claims to Indigenous ancestry, and that she now identified as wholly of settler origin. She wrote: "My failure to understand the importance of substantiating what I believed my identity to be raises questions about my complicity with the structures of settler colonialism and white supremacy culture," and that she would work to repay monies received that had been earmarked for Indigenous artists.

Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective

Ociciwan Contemporary Art Collective is a Canadian artist collective based in Edmonton, Alberta with a mandate to develop innovative and experimental projects involving Indigenous artists.
History.
Established in 2015 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, on Treaty 6 territory, the founding core collective members were Tiffany Shaw-Collinge, Erin Sutherland, Becca Taylor, and Kristy Trinier. Current Core Collective members include Tiffany Shaw-Collinge, Erin Sutherland, Becca Taylor, Halie Finney and Alberta Rose W. From the collectives' website: "The name Ociciwan is an inanimate Plains Cree noun relating to current or river, translated to mean the current comes from there. The name references the North Saskatchewan River that has brought many people over time to the region. It conveys an energy of engagement with Indigenous contemporary culture, linking present with the past and the future.""The collective focuses on three to four projects a year, which include art exhibitions, research, public art works and awareness surrounding Indigenous contemporary art. Ociciwan aims to support the work of Indigenous contemporary artists and designers, engage in both local and global contemporary critical dialogue, develop artistic collaboration, promote and encourage research, production, presentation and awareness of Indigenous contemporary art practices.
Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre.
In Fall 2018, Ociciwan announced that the collective would be opening the Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre in a retrofitted, 6,945 square-foot, two-storey building in downtown Edmonton. The space, designed by Rockliff Pierzchajlo Kroman Architects, will include a kitchen, resource library, community space, and offices for rent in addition to gallery space. The Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre will be the first Indigenous-run contemporary art centre in Edmonton.
Ociciwan's grand opening exhibition at the new space, "amiskwacîwâskahikan," had been planned for March 2020. Just two weeks before the event, the gallery was forced to delay the opening indefinitely due to COVID-19. In June 2020, the gallery was the target of a theft, including new media equipment and a piece by Lana Whiskeyjack slated for the opening exhibition. The stolen artwork is a beaded medallion crafted with deer lace and rabbit fur titled "Three Generations of nitêh (my heart)." In a public plea to find the piece, Whiskeyjack said, "the significance of the work is much more than the monetary value — it is a creative practice of paradigm shifting to help address the violence against Indigenous People as well as to help lift their spirits and cultural awareness."

Holly Ward

Holly Ward is an interdisciplinary artist based in Vancouver, BC. Ward's work utilizes sculpture, multi-media installation, drawing and architecture to explore the role of aesthetics in creating social realities.
Life.
Ward obtained a BA in English from the University of New Brunswick in 1995 and went on to obtain a BFA, Interdisciplinary from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1999. In 2006, Ward completed her MFA, Studio at the University of Guelph.
Artistic practice.
Ward has participated in group exhibitions in Canada, England, Mexico, the United States, Norway and South Korea and has shown seven solo exhibitions, the last being in 2009. Ward's first solo exhibition, "More Softer Please", took place at the Helen Pitt Gallery, Vancouver, BC in 2000. In 2009, Ward's work, "Island", was included in the Vancouver Art Gallery's exhibition, "How Soon Is Now. Island" consisted of a large pile of soil that was moved by volunteers to different parts of the gallery during the show. Vancouver Art Gallery curator, Kathleen Ritter said of "Island," "it's a playfully irreverent work and it challenged our conventional notions of the art object being static, by making something that has an almost parasitical relationship with the other works in the exhibition." In 2018, a new installation by Ward, "Raw Goods", was shown at the Polygon Gallery in Vancouver as part of their inaugural exhibition, "N.Vancouver". The work consisted of "two wide, cone-like piles - one coal, one sulphur. Both commodities are integral to the local economy, and the sulphur's bright yellow is a familiar sight for anyone who has spent time on the Stanley Park seawall across the Inlet." In 2016, Ward's work "Industry is Useless Without Culture: REsource Extraction #1-3" was acquired by the Vancouver Art Gallery for its permanent collection.
Collaboration.
Ward is a long-time collaborator with Vancouver artist, Kevin Schmidt. The pair collaborated on Schmidt's "EDM House" (2013), "The Pavilion, Phase 2" (2011–), an architectural hybrid that is also the pair's home, and "Screen in the Landscape" (2015–).

Kitty Doner

Kitty Doner (born Catherine Donohue, September 6, 1895 — August 26, 1988) was an American vaudeville performer. She was a male impersonator, actress, and dancer, specializing in boy roles, and later in life worked as a choreographer and television producer.
Early life.
Catherine Donohue was born in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents Joe Doner and Nellie Doner, both born in England, were also vaudeville performers, as were her siblings Ted and Rose.
Career.
Kitty Doner was considered the best American male impersonator of her day, compared favorably to British acts such as Vesta Tilley and Ella Shields. She was petite, and her characters were often youthful. She was known for changing from masculine to feminine clothing on stage, in view of the audience, to demonstrate how much of her impersonation was skill rather than elaborate costume. In 1921, she performed at a benefit for the Women's Auxiliary of the National Disabled Soldiers League at the Apollo Theater. That same year, she also performed at a benefit for the American Committee for Relief in Ireland, at the Metropolitan Opera House.
Her Broadway credits included "The Passing Show of 1913", "Dancing Around" (1914, with Al Jolson), "Robinson Crusoe Jr." (1916, again with Jolson), "Sinbad" (1918, again with Jolson), and "The Dancing Girl" (1923, appearing with her brother and sister). Doner's act was preserved in an early sound short film, "A Bit of Scotch" (1928).
In 1945 she co-produced a now-lost musical television series for CBS, "Choreotones", with dancer Pauline Koner. After that, the pair produced some shows for "Holiday on Ice". Koner remembered, "With a famous show biz career behind her, Kitty was still looking for new trends. Her taste was impeccable. A lively force behind the scenes, she was always scouting material and interesting talent." Her last work before retirement was auditioning acts for "Ted Mack's Amateur Hour" in the early 1950s.
Personal life.
Kitty Doner died in 1988, aged 92 years, in Los Angeles, California. There is a collection of Doner's papers, including an unpublished autobiography, photographs and scrapbooks, archived at the University of California Santa Barbara Library.

Tassagh Viaduct

The Tassagh Viaduct is a railway viaduct near Tassagh, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. Tassagh Beetling Mill sits almost immediately beneath it.
History.
The viaduct was completed in 1910, bridging the Callan River Valley. It was originally part of the Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway, though services to Castleblayney were ended in 1924 and from 1932 onwards, all trains across the Tassagh Viaduct were goods trains to and from Keady- It was at this time that the nearby Tassagh Halt closed. The line had been taken over by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) shortly after opening.
Final closure of the line and viaduct came in 1957. In December 1976, Tassagh Viaduct became a Grade B listed building.
Design.
The viaduct is 11 arches long, and at its greatest height, 24 metres. It is 174 metres in length, and built of concrete (piers) and brick (arches and vaulting).

Diuris praecox

Diuris praecox, commonly known as the early doubletail, Newcastle doubletail or rough doubletail is a species of orchid which is endemic to New South Wales. It has two or three grass-like leaves and up to ten light yellow flowers with a few dark brown marks. It is threatened by urbanisation.
Description.
"Diuris praecox" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between six and ten flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are pale yellow with a few dark brown markings at the base of the dorsal sepal and labellum. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, narrow egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect with a narrow elliptic to egg-shaped blade long and wide on a blackish stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are linear to egg-shaped, long and about wide. There are two ridged calli long in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from July to early September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris praecox" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Glenrock State Conservation Area and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("praecox") is a Latin word meaning "too early ripe" or "premature" referring to the early flowering period of this orchid, especially compared to the similar "Diuris abbreviata".
Distribution and habitat.
The early doubletail grows in coastal and near-coastal forests between Bateau Bay and Smiths Lake, especially in the Munmorah State Conservation Area and Wyrrabalong National Park.
Conservation.
"Diuris praecox" is listed as "vulnerable" under the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" and the New South Wales "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016". The main threats to the species are loss of habitat due to urbanisation, weed invasion, uncontrolled track expansion and impacts due to recreational use.

Stella Donnelly

Stella Donnelly (born 10 April 1992) is a Welsh-Australian musician. Born in Western Australia to a Welsh mother, she spent some childhood years living in Morriston before moving to Perth, Australia with her family.
Early life.
Donnelly first started singing when she joined a rock band in high school (Irene McCormack Catholic College) that performed Green Day covers. After high school, Donnelly studied contemporary and jazz music at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts.
Donnelly was also part of the bands Boat Show and Bell Rapids before leaving both to pursue her solo career.
Career.
2017-present: "Beware of the Dogs".
Donnelly released her first EP titled "Thrush Metal" in 2017 on the record label Healthy Tapes. In 2018, the EP was reissued in the United States by the American label Secretly Canadian. 
Donnelly released her debut album, "Beware of the Dogs", on 8 March 2019 via Secretly Canadian. It received widespread acclaim from critics, including Robert Christgau, who praised it as a "musical encyclopedia of [male] assholes".
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, "Beware of the Dogs" was nominated for Breakthrough Artist. In October 2019, Donnelly came at no.6 in "Happy Mag"s list of "The 15 Australian female artists changing the game right now".
Personal life.
For recreation, Donnelly enjoys playing squash, swimming at beaches, birdwatching, gardening, completing cryptic crosswords, cooking, rock climbing with her partner, and playing board games with friends. In an interview with "The Line of Best Fit", she stated: "My version of taking a break [from recording and touring] is filling up my day with as many activities as possible."
Donnelly describes Billy Bragg and Courtney Barnett as musical influences.
Political views and activism.
Donnelly is a supporter of various social and political causes. Her 2017 debut single "Boys Will be Boys", written about societal attitudes towards women and her friend's experience of sexual assault, was dubbed a "#MeToo anthem" (despite being written and released prior to the widespread global coverage of the movement).
Donnelly is opposed to the celebration of Australia Day. In a 2019 interview with "The Guardian", she stated: "It's a really nationalist, white pride day... and it's actually a very historic day for Indigenous Australians – an invasion day, and a day of mourning." Donnelly supports same-sex marriage, and was "relieved" when it was legalised in Australia in 2017. Donnelly is pro-choice.

Un épisode sous la Terreur

Un épisode sous la Terreur (English "An Episode during the Terror") is a short story by Honoré de Balzac, published in 1830. Originally titled "Une messe en 1793" "(A Mass in 1793)", the text took its final title in the Chlendowski edition of 1845. The work appears in "Scènes de la vie politique" "(Scenes from Political Life)", which is a part of the series of works that make up "La Comédie humaine" "(The Human Comedy)", Balzac's multi-volume collection of interlinked stories. The later edition is dedicated to Monsieur Guyonnet-Merville, under whom Balzac had done his apprenticeship and studied the foundations of law.
Plot summary.
An elderly woman buys a package from a bakery on 22 January 1793, and suspects she is being followed. She asks for protection from the baker, but when he sees the stranger following her he refuses. She returns home alone, and it is revealed that she is an ex-Carmelite nun in hiding with another nun and a priest. All are elderly, and the box she bought contains communion wafers. The stranger comes up to their room, and asks the priest to say a mass for the recently executed King Louis XVI. He returns later to attend the mass. He also says that he will come back in a year for another mass for the king, and promises that they will be safe from any danger. He leaves a blood stained handkerchief with royal insignia as a present.
The next year the stranger returns for the mass. Later, the priest visits a shop owned by some Royalist friends of his, and notices a tumbril passing by with the executioner and his victims. The priest faints when he recognises that the executioner is the stranger who has been helping them, and realises that the handerkerchief was the king's.
Historical background.
The story takes place during the Reign of Terror, from 1793 to 1794. It starts the day after the execution of King Louis XVI. The story is fictional, but it features an historical figure, Charles-Henri Sanson, who was the High Executioner, and conducted the execution of Louis XVI. However the story does not give his name.
The Reign of Terror was a period during which there was a process of Dechristianisation occurring in France. The nuns and priest in the story are in hiding because of this.
Inspiration.
The idea of writing the story was most likely born after Balzac's meeting with Sanson's son, Henri-Nicolas-Charles Sanson, also an executioner. Perhaps the son's stories about his father— an extremely religious man despite his work—inspired Balzac to write a story that is not based on actual facts, but on the human aspect of a real life character, and on alternate events that could have taken place. "An Episode Under the Terror" is also a clear proof of the influence of Romanticism on Balzac's work, and is evident in the general atmosphere of the story and its structure (the mystery of the main character and the drama of the final scene).

Like (TV series)

Like, la leyenda, or simply Like is a Mexican telenovela that premiered on Las Estrellas on 10 September 2018 and ended on 20 January 2019. The telenovela is produced by Pedro Damián for Televisa. The series follows the lives of thirteen students and the problems that adolescents experience during their time in high school.
Plot.
The telenovela narrates the experiences of a group of young people interned at the Life Institute of Knowledge and Evolution (LIKE), a prestigious and cosmopolitan educational institution, with a supposedly modern and open educational system, but in reality it is deeply traditional and schematic. In this institution, which presumes its level of vanguard, each beginning of the school year a new generation of high school students are formed with rigid and tedious routines, in addition to educational techniques that do not excite anyone. The educational plan of Like, completely obsolete, has made teachers and students apathetic and conformist. That apathetic atmosphere will be challenged by Gabriel Rey, "Gabo", an atypical teacher who will come to the school after many years of experience, and who was also a student at Like. Gabo will encourage students not to conform to what adults want to impose on them, provoking a true revolution in Like, which will generate confrontations between teachers, parents and students.
Production.
The first scenes were filmed in Jerusalem, Israel, in March 2018 and in April filming began in the forum 14 of Televisa San Ángel. At the end of July, the production of the first season entered its final stretch. Pedro Damián confirmed that the first season will have 97 episodes, 17 more than expected. Damián also revealed that he is already working in the second season and that in October he will travel to Japan for filming and intends to film also in Brazil. Filming of the first season ended on 9 November 2018. On 14 November 2018, the magazine People en Español, confirmed that there are no plans to continue doing more seasons due to the discrete audience data, however the musical group will continue.
Casting.
To choose the protagonists of the series, the production team traveled all over the world to perform casting, the series will feature actors from different parts of the world such as Israel, Japan, United States, Spain, Colombia and Peru.
Musical group.
A band was formed with eight of the main actors in the series. The members are Ale Müller, Anna Iriyama, Carlos Said, Macarena Garcia, Mauricio Abad, Roberta Damián, Santiago Achaga and Victor Varona. The band sings songs presented on the show. Like's debut performance was at Premios Juventud on 22 July 2018 in Miami. They performed their first single, "Este Movimiento". The official music video for "Este Movimiento" premiered on 10 July 2018 and was officially released for digital download and streaming on 20 July 2018. On 14 November 2018, it was announced that Ale Müller and Carlos Said left the band. An Extended play containing 4 songs from the series was released on 22 February 2019.

Evann Siebens

Evann Siebens is a Canadian media artist with a background in dancing based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Her current practice cross-references dance performance and media. Siebens' film works have been shown both nationally and internationally and have won awards. She recently exhibited a geodesic dome and 360 projection at the Belkin Gallery in Vancouver and also screened a commissioned work on the exterior of the Vancouver Art Gallery. Her moving billboard "Orange Magpies Triptych" was part of Capture’s Photography Festival. She has also performed live with her media at New Media Gallery and the Western Front, Vancouver. 
Siebens writes about dance films and techniques for applying filmmaking to dance, and has been praised for her practical insights into the filming of dance and the creative interactions between dance and film technique which she credits for expanding the cinematic experience: “I’m interested in breaking the frame, in moving beyond the traditional two-dimensional space of film, in questioning the status quo. The visual transgressions of dance media, that on the surface seem so simple and pleasing, are an entry point for feminists and activists to have their say, an allowance for the complexity of politics, enabled by the moving body through time and space.”
Siebens is represented by Wil Aballe Art Projects in Vancouver.
Education.
Evann Siebens studied dance at the National Ballet School of Canada and the Royal Ballet School in London, England. She danced with the National Ballet of Canada and the Bonn Ballet in Germany.
Siebens graduated from New York University in 1996, with a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude. 
She participated in residencies at the Banff Centre, Banff, Calgary, UNIT/PITT, Vancouver, ACME, London UK, with Keith Doyle and TRII Art Hub Residency in Athens, Greece.
Work.
Film.
Siebens has filmed dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov, Peter Boal, Viola Farber, Bill T. Jones, Jose Navas, and Sara Rudner.
Siebens' documentaries have been screened at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York and on PBS.
Her documentary film "American Aloha", with Lisette Marie Flanary, focuses on the history and rebirth of hula dancing. It was produced for the PBS POV series. The film was made on a budget of $300,000. Filmed over period of five years, it focuses on three kumu hula or hula masters teaching in California: Sissy Kaio of Hula Halau O Lilinoʻe, Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu of Na Mele Hula ‘Ohana and Patrick Makuakāne of Na Lei Hulu I Ka Wekiu. The film breaks down stereotypes about hula, in part by focusing on male dancers as well as females. To successfully complete the film, it was necessary to spend time with the Hawaiian hula community and win their trust. The film won a CINE Golden Eagle Award in 2003, a Silver Hugo Award at the Chicago International Television Festival, and the Bronze Award in Cultural Documentary at WorldFest Houston. The film also screened at the Hawai‘i International Film Festival, and the Native American Film and Video Festival at the Smithsonian Institution.
Siebens' 2018 short film "time reversal symmetry" was part of a collaboration between artists and scientists at TRIUMF: Canada’s national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics. It screened at the Dance on Camera Festival in New York City, the Seyr Festival in Tehran, Iran, the Dublin Dance Festival and the Light Moves Festival of Screendance in Limerick, Ireland, where it won the "Light Moves Prize for Outstanding Overall Work". She has collaborated with dancer/choreographer Justine A. Chambers.
Cross Disciplinary Projects.
Siebens has exhibited at Eyebeam, 
Centre Georges Pompidou, 
Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia, 
Hotshoe Gallery, London, UK, G++ Media Gallery, Victoria, Canada and Wil Abelle Art Projects in Vancouver.
Siebens' performance piece "Orange Magpies" was commissioned by Vancouver's Burrard Arts Foundation and Vancouver Art Gallery in 2017. 
This work was subsequently exhibited as a large-scale projection on the facade of the Vancouver Art Gallery as part of the Facade Festival that same year. Siebens' video documented a six minute, choreographed piece performed by dancers James Gnam and Vanessa Goodman. They are featured in locations from across the Lower Mainland of Vancouver, many of them unceded traditional territories of First Nations peoples such as the Coast Salish, the Squamish, the Tsleil-Waututh and the Musqueam. Siebens' intent as a non-Indigenous artist was "to use the mediums of dance and film to explore issues of colonialism and her role in reconciliation."
Awards.
She has received notable awards in her career as an artist, such as; MIMMiC Commission from On Main Gallery + Paul Wong Projects, Vancouver, Canada. Gesture, 2015, ID / Identities Istanbul 2012; Best Video Prize for Chromatic Revelry, 2012. Her work has been supported by The National Endowment for the Arts, The New York State Council for the Arts, and The Corporation for Public Broadcasting amongst others.

Afrella or Arilda was an early 6th century Welsh saint .
Afrelia was the daughter of "a high-ranking official at the royal court of Gwent" whom it has been suggested was Vortimer, a son of Vortigen and his queen Severa Verch Macsen (daughter of Roman Emperor Maximus).
She was the wife of Umbrafel. Umbrafel had a nephew Samson of Dol. When Samson persuaded his parents to join a monastery, Umbrafel and his wife Afrelia, decided to do likewise. Afrelia was also mother of Saint Maglorius, Henwg and another unknown child. She is said to have founded a monastery. Peter C. Bartrum suggests that she may be identical to the little-known Saint Arilda of Oldbury-on-Severn and Oldbury-on-the-Hill in Gloucestershire.

Anne Walmsley

Anne Walmsley is a British-born editor, scholar, critic and author, notable as a specialist in Caribbean art and literature, whose career spans five decades. She is widely recognised for her work as Longman's Caribbean publisher, and for Caribbean books that she authored and edited. Her pioneering school anthology, "The Sun's Eye: West Indian Writing for Young Readers" (1968), drew on her use of local literary material while teaching in Jamaica. A participant in and chronicler of the Caribbean Artists Movement, Walmsley is also the author of "The Caribbean Artists Movement: A Literary and Cultural History, 1966–1971" (1992) and "Art in the Caribbean" (2010). She lives in London.
Education and career.
Anne Walmsley has a BA in English from Durham University, and an MA in African Studies from Sussex University.
In the late 1950s, she worked for four years as a secretary at Faber and Faber, before going on to teach for three years at Westwood High School in Jamaica. On returning to London she was employed for a while with the BBC Schools television service, before joining the publisher Longman in 1967 as their first editor for the Caribbean focused on providing local educational material, in which role she travelled throughout the region for nine years. Her experience teaching in Jamaica between 1959 and 1963 informed her compilation of the anthology "The Sun's Eye", which drew on Caribbean literary material; published in 1968, the anthology went on to secure an ongoing presence on school syllabuses. Caribbean writers published at Longman's on Walmsley's watch include Roy Heath (whose first novel, "A Man Come Home", she took on in 1974), George Lamming, Samuel Selvon and Ismith Khan. During this time Walmsley participated in the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM), founded in 1966 by Kamau Brathwaite (then L. Edward Brathwaite), John La Rose and Andrew Salkey.
After 10 years as Longman's Caribbean publisher, she spent two years in Nairobi as Publishing Manager for Longman Kenya, and on her return to the UK she took an MA in African Studies at the University of Sussex. She subsequently worked as a freelance editor and consultant, and was also active with ATCAL (the Association for the Teaching of Caribbean and Africa Literature, founded in the late 1970s). In 1985 she began research into CAM, funded by a Leverhulme Fellowship. Another landmark anthology, "Facing the Sea" (1986), co-edited by Walmsley (with Nick Caistor), introduced writing from the Dutch, French and Spanish Caribbean to secondary school students of the Anglophone Caribbean, its regional span prompted by discussion of such writing in CAM. In 1992 she was awarded a PhD from the University of Kent for her thesis on CAM. That same year it was published as a book by New Beacon Books, entitled "The Caribbean Artists Movement: A Literary and Cultural History, 1966–1971", and is considered to be a "groundbreaking study". In addition she taught part of an MA course, "Aspects of Caribbean Art", at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 2000.
Walmsley's articles have appeared in many journals and literary magazines over the years, among them "BIM", "Wasafiri", "South", "BOMB", "ArtsEtc", and elsewhere. She has also contributed essays to exhibition catalogues and has produced critical writings on Caribbean visual artists, especially Aubrey Williams. Her 1990 book "Guyana Dreaming", which Williams saw in manuscript 10 days before his death, was the first significant publication on the artist's work. She co-edited "Art in the Caribbean: an Introduction" with Stanley Greaves, in collaboration with Christopher Cozier, launching the volume at the October Gallery in October 2010.
The Anne Walmsley Collection &amp; Archive.
In 2016–17, she donated her collection of documents on Caribbean art – including exhibition catalogues, photographs, interviews and correspondence with artists, and other papers – to the Alma Jordan Library at the University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago.
Earlier she had donated her CAM research material to the George Padmore Institute in London, her correspondence with Caribbean writers over many years to the University of Sussex, and her library of Caribbean literature to the University of Newcastle.
Later in 2018, Anne Walmsley donated material to Newcastle University Robinson Library Special Collections and Archives, as part of the Walmsley (Anne) Archive.
Awards.
Walmsley was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of the West Indies, Mona campus, Jamaica, in 2009. The citation stated: "Dr. Anne Walmsley has long crossed over from being a distant enthusiast or detached observer of the still flowering Caribbean literary and artistic tradition: rather we can comfortably recognize her as an integral and active component of the Caribbean Artists Movement."
At the NGC Bocas Lit Fest in 2018 Walmsley was named as the recipient of the Henry Swanzy Award in recognition of her distinguished service to Caribbean letters. In the words of the "Trinidad and Tobago Guardian", reporting the award: "One of the most avid supporters and facilitators of Caribbean literature for many decades, Anne Walmsley shepherded key writers into print during her time at Longman, and her school anthologies exposed generations of Caribbean children to the literature of their home region."

Historic Vehicle Association

The Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) was founded in 2009 in America to promote the cultural and historical significance of the automobile, and protect the future of automotive history. The society has been an influential part of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Historic American Engineering Record (a part of the Heritage Documentation Programs), and has helped identify historical significance and excellence in car making. With over 375,000 members, the HVA claims to be the world's largest historic vehicle owners' organization.
HVA was founded with philanthropic support of Hagerty, and became the designated North American representative of FIVA (Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens), the international federation of historic vehicle organizations – both for the U.S. and Canada.
Mission strategy.
The Historic Vehicle Association aims to achieve its mission in four ways:
Listing an automobile on the National Register of Historic Places.
The National Register For Historic Places does allow an automobile to be included as either an historic object or historic structure. To date (2020) no state or commonwealth in the United States with historic property listings have an automobile individually listed. In 2014, a private attempt with the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission to list a 1922 Model T Ford. The process went as far as the Keeper of the National Register and a listing in the Federal Register. Both the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and The National Park service rejected the nomination.

2010 Mount Meager landslide

The 2010 Mount Meager landslide was a large catastrophic debris avalanche that occurred in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, on August 6 at 3:27 a.m. PDT (UTC-7). More than of debris slid down Mount Meager, temporarily blocking Meager Creek and destroying local bridges, roads and equipment. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and one of over 20 landslides to have occurred from the Mount Meager massif in the last 10,000 years.
Although voluminous, there were no fatalities caused by the event due in part to its remote and uninhabited location. The landslide was large enough to send seismic waves more than away into the neighbouring U.S. states of Alaska and Washington and beyond. Multiple factors led to the slide: Mount Meager's weak slopes have left it in a constant state of instability.
Background.
Mount Meager, located north of Vancouver, is a peak of the Mount Meager massif. This is a group of coalescent stratovolcanoes and the largest volcanic centre in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. It comprises about of eruptive rocks that were deposited during four distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 2.2 million years ago. During the present period (beginning 150,000 years ago), it has erupted more than five times, producing ash falls, pyroclastic flows, lava flows and lahars. The only identified Holocene eruption was in about 410 BC and created a diverse sequence of volcanic deposits well exposed along the Lillooet River. This is the most recent major explosive eruption in British Columbia, as well as the largest known Holocene explosive eruption in Canada.
The massif has been a source of large volcanic debris flows for the last 8,000 years, many of which have reached several tens of kilometres downstream in the Lillooet River valley. It is arguably the most unstable mountain massif in Canada and may also be its most active landslide area. The earliest identified Holocene landslide was in 7900 BP and further landslides occurred in 6250 BP, 5250 BP, 4400 BP, 2600 BP, 2400 BP, 2240 BP, 2170 BP, 1920 BP, 1860 BP, 870 BP, 800 BP, 630 BP, 370 BP, 210 BP, 150 BP and in 1931, 1947, 1972, 1975, 1984, 1986 and 1998. These events were attributed to structurally weak volcanic rocks, glacial unloading, recent explosive volcanism and Little Ice Age glacial activity.
Landslide.
At 3:27 a.m. PDT on August 6, 2010, the southern peak of Mount Meager collapsed in a series of major rockfalls. The rockfalls fell approximately onto Meager's weak and heavily saturated south flank where they destabilized a significant volume of material, forming a highly mobile, very rapid debris flow. The debris flow travelled the entire length of Capricorn Creek then inundated both the Meager Creek and Lillooet River valleys. Meager Creek was dammed for about 19 hours during which time water had built up behind the dam to create a long lake. The landslide dam ultimately failed into the Lillooet River valley, releasing roughly of water towards Pemberton with an average velocity of approximately . No deaths or injuries were associated with the event.
A study conducted by Guthrie "et al." (2012) concluded that groundwater played a key role in the collapse. Prior to failure the flanks of Meager were subject to high pore water pressures indicated by extensive surface seepage observed throughout the failure surface and along lateral shears following the 2010 event. The largest visible bedrock spring occurred along the west lateral scarp and was the location of at least two previous landslides, occurring in 1998 and 2009. Water supply was exacerbated by summer melt of snow and ice, causing even greater saturation of slopes.
With a volume of approximately , the 2010 landslide was comparable in volume to the 1965 Hope Slide, making it one of the largest in Canadian history. The landslide consisted mainly of intrusive porphyritic rhyodacite, lava flows and breccia derived from the Capricorn and Plinth assemblages, which are the most recently formed geological formations comprising the Mount Meager massif.
Impact.
Despite the remote location of the landslide, the event had considerable socioeconomic impact. Approximately of wood was stripped away from the slopes of Capricorn Creek and Meager Creek and the Lillooet River valley bottom and either pulverized into fine organic material or transported as large woody debris into the river system. The wood was a mixture of western hemlock, amabilis and subalpine firs, western red cedar and to a lesser extent lodgepole pine and balsam poplar. The total potential loss based on the markets at the time of the event was C$8.7 million. In addition, road construction equipment and two forest service bridges were destroyed, along with several kilometres of roads including almost of the Meager Creek forest service road.
The landslide and the subsequent threat of a dam outburst flood on Meager Creek caused the evacuation of approximately 1,500 residents in the lower Lillooet River valley for one night and rescue efforts for several campers and workers in the vicinity of Mount Meager. Sediment moving downstream puts pressure on the Pemberton district diking system, raising the effective flood levels. The obliteration of Capricorn Creek and inundation of Meager Creek will have long-lasting environmental effects. In total, direct costs associated with the event were estimated at C$10 million. If gravel removal or dike elevation changes become necessary as a result of the increased sediment load, the total long-term costs of this landslide could exceed the direct costs.
Seismic signature.
The landslide generated long-period seismic waves that were visible at seismograph stations from southern California to northern Alaska, up to away. No known earthquake was associated with the failure, but the event itself was assigned an equivalent local magnitude of 2.6 by the Canadian National Seismograph Network.
Landslides do not always generate identifiable seismic signatures due in part to their slower source process and poor ground coupling as compared to earthquakes. Seismic energy conversion rates for similar events are estimated to be as low as 0.01% of the kinetic energy and 1% of the potential energy released by the slide. It requires an extremely energetic source to generate waves high enough in amplitude to be visible for thousands of kilometres. The seismogenic nature of this landslide was a result of the large volume of material involved and the extremely rapid velocities.
Eyewitnesses.
Four people witnessed the event and were in extreme jeopardy on several occasions during and immediately following the landslide. K. Kraliz, J. Duffy, J. Tilley and P. Smith arrived at upper Lillooet forest campsite at 3:25 a.m. PDT and began unloading their gear. They were surprised by "two large cracks" (loud explosive noises, not physical cracks in the ground) occurring in quick succession, followed by a rumbling that initially sounded like a train or a forest fire, but that grew to a deafening volume in about 20 seconds. All four campers got back into their truck and headed for higher ground. Chaos ensued for the next few hours before daylight as they encountered debris flows, mud, falling trees and other hazards at the edge of the landslide deposit in the Lillooet River valley.
Perhaps the most alarming part of their story occurred as they came face to face with a high wall of mud and water that appeared to them like a "turbulent bubbling wedge of black oil". They turned their truck around, but not before they were overtaken by the hyperconcentrated flow. Accelerating rapidly, they nonetheless escaped, in what P. Smith described as most resembling "the Millennium Falcon escaping the Death Star explosion at the end of Return of the Jedi". The two large cracks heard by the witnesses may have been caused by the impact of Meager's failed secondary peak.
Significance.
The 2010 landslide is significant for seven reasons:
The event illustrated the extreme landslide hazard of glacier-clad dissected Quaternary volcanic centres, which results from the existence of steep slopes in poor quality rock (reflecting such factors as hydrothermal alteration and heterogeneity of volcanic products). In this geological environment, landslides are a major process of denudation and, through transformation into debris flows, deliver large volumes of debris to river systems.

Società della Ferrovia Sicula Occidentale

The Società della Ferrovia Sicula Occidentale (Railway Company of Western Sicily) was established in 1878 to construct a railway between Palermo, Marsala and Trapani.
History.
The company was established in Rome under a notarial deed of 3 September 1878 with a paid-up capital of 22 million lire divided into 44,000 shares. It obtained government approval by Royal Decree of 30 September of the same year. it built and inaugurated the first railway connection between the two cities of Palermo and Trapani in 1881. Work began with the opening, on 1 June 1880, of the first stretch from the new Palermo Lolli station (later replaced by Palermo Notarbartolo railway station) in Partinico. A month later it inaugurated the stretch to the south connecting Trapani to Castelvetrano. In March 1881 it linked Partinico with Castellammare del Golfo and finally, on 5 June 1881, the entire route was completed with the activation of the central section of Castellammare del Golfo - Castelvetrano. In 1882 the company built the link, from Palermo Lolli to the Bivio Madonna dell'Orto, (more recently called Bivio Marittima, for the port of Palermo). This connected to the Calabrian-Sicilian railway but the connection was only used for goods traffic. In 1884, the company was registered in the official list of the Milan stock exchange.
Locomotives.
The company ordered 14 steam locomotives from Reale Opificio di Pietrarsa. They were delivered between 1880 and 1885 and numbered 1-20. In 1886 Ansaldo supplied locomotives 35 and 36 and, between 1891 and 1895, delivered another 6 units similar to the 1-20 group. Subsequently, Ansaldo, in 1901, provided the last unit, number 37, similar to 35 and 36.
Nationalization.
The company operated the Palermo - Trapani Railway via Castelvetrano until August 1, 1907, when it was incorporated into the Italian State Railways (FS). Of the 1-20 group of locomotives, 16 units were registered as FS Class 385, while the three units in the 35-37 group were registered as FS Class 388.

Battle of Blomindon

The Battle of Blomindon took place on 21 May 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The naval battle involved three armed U.S. privateer vessels against three Nova Scotian vessels off Cape Split, Nova Scotia. American Privateers caught two Nova Scotia Vessels. The first Nova Scotia vessel was re-captured by Lieut Benjamin Belcher. The second Nova Scotia vessel was overtaken by the captured crew under the command of Captain Bishop. The privateers were taken to Cornwallis and put on trial. 
Background.
During the American Revolutionary War, the U.S. regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. U.S. privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. After the British destroyed the Penobscot Expedition, the U.S. privateers began their most fierce revenge by attacking Nova Scotia.
The engagement between the U.S. privateers and local militia was one of several in the region. On 2 May 1777, in the Minas Basin the Captain Collet ordered the capture the U.S. privateer schooner Sea Duck, under the command of John Bohannan. He had the vessel taken to Windsor. There was another raid on the Cornwallis Township in 1778. In June 1779, the British troops at Windsor captured 12 U.S. privateers in the Bay of Fundy, where they cruised in a large boat, armed, plundering the vessels and the inhabitants. 
On 10 July 1780, the British privateer brig "Resolution" (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the U.S. privateer "Viper" (22 guns and 130 men) off Halifax at Sambro Light. In what one observer described as "one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering", the two privateers began a "severe engagement" during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes. The engagement resulted in the surrender of the British ship and the death of up to 18 British and 33 U.S. sailors.
Battle.
There were 30 U.S. privateers in one armed shallop (one carriage gun and six swivels) and two whaleboats. They captured Captain Sheffield’s schooner. 
Captain William Bishop, in a small schooner (35 men), pursued the three privateer vessels and their prize. Bishop was in a 25 minute naval battle with the privateers but was captured by them. 
Lieutenant Belcher in the armed sloop "Success" (with 28 crewmen) pursued the three U.S. privateer vessels and their two prizes (Sheffield’s schooner and Bishop’s schooner). Belcher caught Sheffield’s vessel, killing one privateer in the process. Many of the privateers then escaped in their whaleboat to the shores of Cape Split.
Belcher then began to pursue Captain Bishop’s vessel. During the pursuit Captain Bishop overthrew his captors and regained command of his schooner. He sent the remaining U.S. privateer prisoners to Cornwallis.
Afterward.
U.S. privateers continued to attack vessels in the Bay of Fundy. On August 7, 1781 the British schooner Adventure captured the schooner Mary off Annapolis. In the fall of 1781, under orders of Captain James Nevins (Nevens, Nivens, Nuyens, Nevers), Mr. Low of the U.S. naval vessel Defence (18 men) went up the Bay of Fundy and was attacked by the Nova Scotia militia. The militia captured two of the Americans, while the rest of the crew fled into the woods and were rescued by Acadians.
Legacy.
The cannon were seven that spoke from their sloop;&lt;br&gt;
And hands that were greedy clutched gladly upon&lt;br&gt;
A ship Amos Sheffield had filled for Saint John.&lt;br&gt;
Their sally was smashed in ten minutes or sooner;&lt;br&gt;
Yanks captured Will Bishop and Jonathan Crane&lt;br&gt;
And all of their party who struggled in vain.&lt;br&gt;
Thus loaded with loot and captives galore,&lt;br&gt;
Three vessels set out from Cornwallis shore,&lt;br&gt;
Then Benjamin Belcher, once born at Gibraltar,&lt;br&gt;
Was fit to be tied in an over-sized halter;&lt;br&gt;
He learned where a vessel with guns might be got,&lt;br&gt;
And rode like a madman to Horton Town Plot.&lt;br&gt;
We were twenty-eight strong in the schooner SUCCESS,&lt;br&gt;
Militiamen bold who with Belcher did press&lt;br&gt;
By horse out to Horton and clambered on board,&lt;br&gt;
And sailed on the track of our foe-men abhorred.&lt;br&gt;
The season was May and the orchards were white;&lt;br&gt;
It seemed a grand day for a wonderful fight.&lt;br&gt;
With the tide running in, they were caught at the Cape; &lt;br&gt;
We hammered their sloop, and in haste to escape&lt;br&gt;
Some took to their dories and scrambled to land&lt;br&gt;
While others lay dead in the ship they had manned.&lt;br&gt;
Still slowed by the tide was the schooner they'd taken&lt;br&gt;
And this by its captors was quickly forsaken,&lt;br&gt;
And promptly Will Bishop and Jonathan Crane&lt;br&gt;
Discomfit their guards and a victory gain.&lt;br&gt;
Thus over the Basin by noon we withdrew&lt;br&gt;
With three captured ships and our jubilant crew.&lt;br&gt;
"The blow that we struck at the Cape was a squelcher!"&lt;br&gt;
Remarked our stout commodore, Benjamin Belcher.
Aftermath.
U.S. privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war. The following year, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, U.S. privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.

1988 UK Athletics Championships

The 1988 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Moorways Stadium, Derby. It was the second time that the English city hosted the event, continuing on from the 1987 UK Championships.
It was the twelfth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1988 AAA Championships.
Fatima Whitbread won her eighth consecutive women's javelin throw UK title, while shot putter Judy Oakes won a fifth straight title. Diana Davies extended her winning streak to three in the women's high jump and Paula Dunn repeated her sprint double of 1987. Three men defended their 1987 titles: Tony Jarrett (110 m hurdles), Paul Mardle (discus) and Dave Smith (hammer). Elaine McLaughlin (400 m hurdles) and Mary Berkeley (long jump) were the other women to retain their titles.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the Olympic Games. Three UK champions went on to win Olympic silver in Seoul: Linford Christie, Liz McColgan and Fatima Whitbread. Colin Jackson only ran the 100 m at the UK Championships, but took a silver in his hurdles speciality at the Olympics.

Neliska Ann Briscoe (April 7, 1914 – August 25, 1994) was an American dancer, jazz band leader, and businesswoman.
Background.
The daughter of Eddie Briscoe, a meatpacker, and Neliska Thomas, a cook and housekeeper from Mexico, Neliska Ann Briscoe was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. She had two half brothers and a sister who died young. Briscoe's career as an entertainer began at about the age of nine when she performed in a club where her uncle, Escaliere Thomas, was employed part-time in the evenings. She got the nickname "Baby" (sometimes "Babe"), which she retained in her entertainment career as an adult.
Early career.
As a child, Briscoe performed in New Orleans at the St. Bernard Alley Cabaret as an acrobatic dancer in a floor show in which she was the sole child performer. A natural on the stage, Briscoe continued to perform as an acrobatic dancer and singer in such New Orleans cabarets as the Astoria, Entertainers, and the Owl in her early teenage years, often mentioned in newspaper articles as a cabaret's main draw.
In February 1931, at the age of seventeen, Briscoe moved to New York City to pursue a career as a dancer. She was employed by Small's Paradise Club.
She was out of work for at least several weeks during her recovery. In 1933 she returned to her native New Orleans to rise to such renown in the local jazz scene that she gained the title "the Sweetheart of New Orleans." Pianist Joe Robichaux hired her to lead his band, the New Orleans Rhythm Boys, a group consisting at times of up to fifteen members, including three women: Briscoe, Joan Lunceford (singer), and Ann Cooper (trumpet). Dressed in what became her trademark tuxedo, Briscoe worked as a tap dancer, entertaining the crowd in front of Robichaux's band during and between musical sets.
Briscoe worked with Robichaux for nearly five years before joining another group, the Harlem Playgirls, in early 1938. Based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota, this African American all-woman band toured the country to popular and critical acclaim. From 1938 to 1940 Briscoe, in her tuxedo and a baton in hand, led the band when it performed at the Apollo Theater in New York City on Thanksgiving Day in 1938 and at smaller venues in Frederick, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Youngstown, Ohio; and Jackson, Tennessee. The Harlem Playgirls made numerous appearances at the Tick Tock Tavern in New Orleans. By this time Briscoe was not just a "front" for the band but a true band leader.
Personal life.
Following her two-year tour with the Harlem Playgirls, Briscoe returned to New Orleans, where she met a merchant mariner named David "Val" Mouton. At the peak of her success she left her career in show business to marry Mouton in 1942. They had two daughters, Avon ("Vonnie") and Debra. Briscoe, a strong advocate for the right to vote, became a registered voter in New Orleans in 1948.
Briscoe divorced her husband in 1950 due to domestic abuse. After the divorce she and her daughters lived with her mother on North Tonti Street in New Orleans, and Briscoe became a successful businesswoman. She studied cosmetology, operated a gift boutique named Avon and Debra's Gift Shop after her daughters, owned a small restaurant, and worked as a seamstress, making ball gowns for Mardi Gras.
In 1957 Briscoe married Clarence Casimire, whom she had known from her youth. The marriage ceremony was performed by Briscoe's half brother Joseph Mitchell at the Christian Mission Baptist Church he co-founded in New Orleans. Shortly after their marriage the couple moved to Cleveland with Briscoe's daughters and Casimire's daughter from a previous marriage. They had one son. Despite her retirement from the stage, Briscoe continued to perform. She started to learn saxophone in her sixties, did splits on her seventy-fifth birthday, and danced on her eightieth birthday.
In 1994 Briscoe was hospitalized with bone cancer at St. Alexis Hospital. A nun at the hospital told one of Briscoe's daughters that Briscoe "had talked of being a famous dancer...about wearing a satin tuxedo and conducting an orchestra. The nun added quickly that it was surely the morphine". She died four months after her 80th birthday, on August 25, 1994.
Awards and honors.
In 2004, Briscoe was included in a feature exhibition celebrating the Women of Jazz at the National Historic Jazz Park in New Orleans. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of her death, her daughters set up the Baby Briscoe Scholarship Fund at Tulane University.

Sophia Goulden

Sophia Jane Goulden (née Craine; 1833 – 1910) was the mother of suffragettes Emmeline Pankhurst and Mary Jane Clarke and she is credited with having an important forming influence on both her daughters’ political beliefs.
Early life.
Sophia Jane Craine was born in Lonan, Isle of Man, in 1833, to William Craine and Jane (née Quine). She was baptised 3 November 1833. Although William was a shoemaker by trade, he and his wife came to manage boarding houses in Douglas, initially Tynwald House at 3 North Quay, and then at Christian Road. In her youth Sophia was described as being ‘an unusually good-looking young lady’ and it is likely that she met Robert Goulden through the boarding house, whether he visited it on business or on holiday. Six years her elder, Robert Goulden was at that time an errand boy at a Manchester manufacturers. Sophia and Robert were married on 8 September 1853 at Kirk Braddan, when Sophia was 18 and Robert 24.
The newly married couple moved to Manchester, where Robert Goulden rose to become managing director of his own manufacturing business. Although the family would visit the Isle of Man regularly through her life, it was in Manchester that Sophia had her eleven children, ten of whom survived into adulthood: Walter, Emmeline, Edmund, Mary, Herbert, Effie, Robert, Ada Sophia, Alfred Harold and Eva Gertrude.
Political engagement.
Later in her life, Emmeline was to write of her parents:‘Those men and women are fortunate who are born at a time when a great struggle for human freedom is in progress. It is an added good fortune to have parents who take a personal part in the great movements of their time. I am glad and thankful that this was my case.’Described as having ‘a bright and attractive personality,’ Sophia and her husband established themselves as members of Manchester's ‘radical elite,’ exposing their family to radical politics and bringing them into contact with ‘the foremost intellectuals of the time.’ It was amidst this ‘atmosphere of reformist zeal’ in the Goulden household that Sophia took her eldest daughter, Emmeline, to her first suffrage meeting in around 1872. Then aged 14, Emmeline left the meeting ‘a confirmed suffragist.’ The speaker they saw that day was Lydia Becker, who was to play an important role in the Isle of Man's becoming the first country in the world to grant votes to women in 1881. When her children were to go on their important roles in the suffragette movement, it was reported that Sophia ‘naturally approved and was entirely in sympathy with them in the matter, and was greatly enthusiastic to secure the [UK] vote for women.’
Later life.
Sophia kept up the connection with the Isle of Man, generally visiting the Island for their summer holidays each year throughout her life. By this time Sophia's mother had moved to 9 Strathallan Crescent, Douglas, which was then bought by Robert Goulden in 1878. It was also here at Strathallan Crescent that Robert died on 24 April 1892, leaving Sophia to live on at the property with just her son, Walter, whose health was poor. Emmeline, Mary, Christabel and others of her family continued to visit her on the Isle of Man, until her death in 1910 at the age of 75. Having been in poor health for some months, she had ‘an attack of double pneumonia’ which led to her death at 5 o’clock on 22 April 1910 at her home. 
Goulden was buried at Braddan New Cemetery, beside her husband. She left an estate worth £789 15s 1d and a will which stated that ‘the share which any female shall take under this my will shall be for her sole and separate use independently of any husband and of his debts.’ Sophia did not live to see her daughter Mary become the first suffragette to die for the cause later that year. She never saw the success of the Suffragette movement and the enfranchisement of women in the UK, although she had had the vote as a widowed property owner, for nearly thirty years in the Isle of Man.
Legacy.
In 1981 Sophia Goulden, along with her daughter, Emmeline, was commemorated with a stamp issued by the Isle of Man Post Office celebrating the enfranchisement of women on the Isle of Man in 1881.
In 2016, the "Friends of Sophia Goulden" was established in order to 'bring Sophia's role in the history of women's suffrage to greater public attention and to raise funds to create a suitable commemorative monument to her on the island.'
In September 2018, a blue plaque in her honour was unveiled at her former home on Strathallan Crescent in Douglas on the Isle of Man where she lived at the end on her life. She was only the fourth person born on the Isle of Man to receive the honour. Her great-great-granddaughter, Helen Pankhurst said: "Sophia's role as a campaigner in the movement, and as mother guiding the interest of her more famous daughter, have so far received insufficient recognition. The plaque can start to change this. Moreover, it's fitting that this plaque will be put up on the Isle of Man, where Sophia came from and returned to, but also the nation that led the way in giving women the right to vote."

Margaret Peterson (artist)

Margaret Peterson (1902 - May 15, 1997) was an American painter of abstract art and known for creating a style that was highly influenced by the art of the Indigenous peoples of North America.
Biography.
Peterson was born in Seattle, Washington in 1902. In the 1920s she studied at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1926 with a Bachelor in Arts and soon joined its faculty of Fine Arts in 1928. The years between 1928 and 1950 were productive years for Peterson; this included a funded trip to Europe (1931), several exhibitions, marriage to her husband, the Canadian writer Howard O'Hagan (1937), and a year spent at Green Point, Cowichan Bay, British Columbia to study Indigenous Art in Victoria’s former anthropological museum (1947-1948). In 1950, at the height of McCarthyism, she rejected an oath of loyalty imposed by the University of California, Berkeley’s board of regents and left her faculty position for New York, where she would have a solo exhibition at the former Algonquin Hotel.
Throughout the 1950s, she would continue to exhibit and travel. In 1951, she went to both Mexico and Guatemala and saw the arts of the Toltecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs, and Mayan cultures and also returned to Cowichan Bay. In 1952 she returned to San Francisco and founded a painting school. By 1956 she had moved to Victoria, BC. During the 1960s she would go on to learn mosaic techniques in Europe (1963), pursue a new interest in Romanesque and Medieval painting (1964), and have a mosaic of hers, "Source of Sources" (1964), installed in the McPherson Library at the University of Victoria. In the 1970s, she returned to Victoria (1974), created a mosaic for the Richard Blanshard building (1976-1977), and had a retrospective exhibition at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria (1978). Her husband died in 1982 and Peterson died on May 15, 1997.
Artistic practice.
"Abstract art is to representative art what poetry is to prose." --Margaret PetersonThroughout her career, Peterson drew from many influences, especially from abstract and Indigenous artworks. In her early career, she was mainly influenced by cubist and other modernist artists. She has said that after seeing work by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, that “They changed my direction in art, and life”. She was also influenced by the Mexican artists Carlos Mérida and Rufino Tamayo, whom she had both met in Mexico City in 1934. From these influences came her interest in form “as a symbol and a plastic constituent” and after 1949, as Colin Graham has said, her “main formal development after that date lay in her use of space, which became increasingly shallow." She was also known to mainly work in egg tempera instead of oil paints, especially after 1934, which was connected to her interest in Medieval European painting and mixed her colors through overlapping layers on her canvas instead of her palette.
Besides formal elements, she was also greatly interested in spirituality and human spiritual beliefs and practices. To Peterson, formal elements were not only lines and colors on a canvas, but, as she has said, “Every line and every brush stroke is a vital related element to the total composition into which human thought has been transferred." On the topic of abstract art, she has said, “It is the act of man’s continual communion with the universe transformed as by magic into substance." From this interest, she was also greatly influenced by the art and practices of many Indigenous groups, who she saw as giving form to universal forces. It is in this way that she believed “art has been a summoning of those inexorable universal forces which man seeks but over which he has no control."

Skeena Reece

Skeena Reece (born 1974) is a Canadian First Nations artist whose multi-disciplinary practice includes such genres as performance art, "sacred clowning," songwriting, and video art. Reece is of Cree, Tsimshian, Gitksan, and Métis descent.
Background.
Skeena Reece was born in 1974 to Red Power movement activist Cleo Reece and internationally renowned carver Victor Reece. She studied at Northwest Community College and later at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design for media arts. She has been working in the arts since 1996 and currently is based out of Vancouver Island. She has also worked in administrative capacities such as the grunt gallery as a curatorial practices intern, founder of the Native Youth Artists Collective, and was Director of the Indigenous Media Arts Group from 2005 to 2007.
Artistic practice.
"I wanted to create this thing that was spiritually intangible and could only be seen as something if you were here right now. And nobody can take it, or even think about it or write about it or read about it later, you’ve kinda gotta be in it. It was just so magical I was like ‘that’s enough. It doesn’t have to go anywhere from here." - Skeena Reece, 2012 Reece is known for making works that deal with issues surrounding settler colonialism and its consequences on Indigenous peoples, especially women. Often these works unsettle and challenge their audiences. She also closely aligns herself and her artistic practice with the figure of the “sacred clown”, a Hopi Indian figure who teaches lessons in uncouth ways. As well, she bases her work on trickster figures such as Coyote and Raven, who is seen as both a prankster, but also as wise. For example, in her performance, "Raven on the Colonial Fleet" (2010), she “wears a corset, skirt and blanket designed with reference to traditional Northwest Coast Aboriginal Art and a feathered headdress referencing the Plains cultures.” Reece uses such regalia to make a political statement and to overturn Indigenous gender roles, for example by wearing a headdress that is usually reserved for men. Images of grenades, arms, and mythological figures cover her clothing to represent her as a “fe/male warrior” and as a mythological figure, like Raven, coming to help fight against colonial violence. In 2010, she also performed this piece at the 17th Biennale in Sydney, Australia. As well, in a 2008 performance for the National Museum of the American Indian based on an episode of the television show, "Moesha", she dressed up as a nurse and asked the audience, "Does anyone want to share any feelings you have about being a "colonizer"?" She proceeded to have another artist bring out a bucket of red paint in which he begins to paint “one of Columbus's ships on a large board as Reece speaks about sexual fetishes, fear of government and the inaccurate portrayal of Indians on television.” Reece saw this “as a metaphor for white people taking the blood of her people and painting their own history of them.” One song in her album "Sweetgrass and Honey" was created to honor carvers like her father and the Nuu-chah-nulth carver John T. Williams in Seattle that was shot by a police officer.
On these issues, her work also deals with the act of caring and reconciliation. Such themes can be seen in her work "Touch Me" (2013), a video work made specifically for the 2013 exhibition, "Witnesses: Art and Canada’s Indian Residential Schools". The fourteen minute video consists of Reece bathing Ukrainian-Canadian artist Sandra Semchuk. In the video, Reece washes Semchuk with a soap and cloth. Semchuk begins to tear up as Reece says “It’s okay, it’s okay.” The film is influenced by her distant relationship with her parents, who were both Canadian Residential School survivors. The film is meant to be an act of reconnection between mother and daughter, child and elder, “wanting to create a space in which touch, intimacy, and connection were animated, as well as a desire to perform a nurturing and loving act of bathing an elder inspired Reece to create this performance.” She also starred in a prominent role in the short film "Savage" about residential schools, along with Ta’kaiya Blaney, Doug Blamey, and Jennifer Jackson. The video won several awards including 2010 Genie award for Best Short Film, a Golden Sheaf Award for Best Multicultural Film, the ReelWorld Outstanding Canadian Short Film, and the Leo Awards for Best Actress and Best Editing. Recently, she has also made adult-sized moss bags, similar to swaddle bags meant to carry babies. They are meant to symbolize the care that families and communities give to new members and they are also a reminder that we always need care in our lives.

Dainik Bangla

Dainik Bangla is a defunct Bengali language daily newspaper in Bangladesh. Obaidul Huque was the president of the Dainik Bangla-Bangladesh Times Trustee Board.
History.
"Dainik Pakistan" was renamed "Dainik Bangla" after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. After independence, the newspaper published reports on Bengali collaborators of the Pakistan Army and war crimes. The reports were used as evidence in the Bangladesh war crimes tribunal. In 1972, Hasan Hafizur Rahman was elected president of the editorial board of the "Dainik Bangla". In 1975, the government of Bangladesh closed all newspapers except "The Daily Ittefaq", "The Bangladesh Times", "The Bangladesh Observer" and the "Dainik Bangla", which were nationalised. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the 15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état, the newspaper, then state-owned, stopped reporting about him and did not cover the anniversary of his death. The newspaper was closed by the Bangladesh Awami League government in 1997 along with other state owned media, "The Bangladesh Times" and "Saptahik Bichitra".
Legacy.
An important road junction in Dhaka, Dainik Bangla intersection, has been named after the newspaper.

90th Infantry Regiment (United States)

The 90th Infantry Regiment was a Regular Army infantry regiment of the United States Army, which existed during World War I and World War II.
The regiment was organized in 1918 during World War I with the 20th Division, but the war ended before it could be deployed overseas; it was demobilized in spring 1919.
During World War II, the 90th Infantry was again activated with the 10th Light Division (the future 10th Mountain) in mid-1943, but was transferred to become a nondivisional separate training unit in early 1944, inactivating in mid-1945. 
World War I.
The 90th Infantry was constituted on 31 August 1918. It was organized during August and September at Camp Sevier, South Carolina, based on a cadre from the 50th Infantry Regiment, assigned to the 40th Infantry Brigade of the 20th Division. The regiment was initially commanded by Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Louis J. Van Schaick, who was replaced by Colonel Henry L. Wagner in early September after the former transferred to command the division trains. After the Armistice ended the war, the three battalions of the regiment were split in December, with one battalion moving to Camp Wadsworth, a second to Camp Hancock, and a third to Camp Greene, where they were demobilized between 13 and 22 March 1919. 
World War II.
Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, which resulted in the United States entry into World War II, the regiment was reconstituted on 10 July 1943, and activated five days later at Camp Hale, Colorado with the 10th Light Division (Alpine), using a cadre from the 105th, 106th, and 165th Infantry Regiments of the 27th Infantry Division, then in Hawaii. These men were reinforced by skiers and mountain climbers from the 86th Infantry Regiment, and the regiment conducted ski and mountain warfare training for the next several months. It was successively commanded by Colonels James E. Lewis and Paul R. Goode.
It was relieved from its assignment to the 10th on 13 (according to the 1953 Department of the Army publication "The Army Lineage Book") or 22 February 1944 (according to historian Shelby Stanton in 1984), and transferred to XVI Corps at Camp Carson as a separate unit. Most of its skiers from Camp Hale were used to reinforce the other regiments of the division before the transfer; they were replaced by men from the 87th Infantry Regiment and other units of the 10th. At Camp Carson, the 611-man cadre of the regiment provided an accelerated six-week course of infantry training (four weeks of familiarization, qualification, and transition firing, and two weeks of tactical training) to 2,900 men, who were formerly members of disbanded anti-aircraft and tank destroyer units or who had volunteered for transfer to the infantry from other branches of the Army, under the command of Colonel James E. Graham. Graham was replaced by Colonel Winfield R. McKay on 26 August. After XVI Corps was sent to Europe, the 90th was assigned to XXXVI Corps on 17 July before it moved to Camp Gruber, Oklahoma on 1 December. There, the regiment joined the Replacement and School Command on 9 February 1945, relocating to Camp Rucker, Alabama, on 17 February, where it inactivated on 10 August after training replacements for the remainder of the war. 
The regiment published a newspaper, titled "The 90th Infantryman", beginning at Camp Carson. The 90th Infantry was never authorized a distinctive unit insignia or coat of arms.

Maria Qamar

Maria Qamar (born 1991) is an artist and author of the book "Trust No Aunty."
Qamar was born in Karachi, Pakistan to a father from Bangladesh and a mother from Gujarat, India. Both parents are chemists. She was exposed to both Bengali culture and Gujarati culture growing up.
In 2000, when she was nine, the family emigrated to Ontario, briefly residing in Scarborough. The family then moved to Mississauga, where she spent the rest of her childhood. She experienced prejudice and bullying against South Asian children in her school, especially in the wake of the September 11 attacks. So as she later recalled, "I started going home and drawing comics about these experiences. But I would change the outcome. In my comics I always got the last laugh." She aligned both with her Desi identity and with Western teen goth, punk rock, and heavy metal subcultures.
She moved to Toronto and took a copywriting job in the advertising industry. This she did not like, and she was laid off around 2015. She then gained popularity as an artist through her Instagram page where she goes by the name of "Hatecopy" (the name indicating her feelings for her former field). As of 2019 she had a following of over 170,000 people on her Instagram platform.
She is known for her satirical lens commenting on the hybridization of South Asian and Canadian culture. She uses a pop art aesthetic to create works that tackle themes surrounding her experiences of racism, the first generation experience, body shaming, classism, and the patriarchy. Her style is explicitly influenced by the work of Roy Lichtenstein and also by low culture such as Indian soap operas; one of her first works was captioned "what if Lichtenstein parodied Indian soap operas." She does not translate her works for Western audiences, instead leaving South Asian terms and themes in unaltered as she focuses on a Desi audience.
Qamar has sold work at exhibitions in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York and London. "The Mindy Project" creator and actor Mindy Kaling collects Qamar's work and her paintings decorated the set of that show. She had also created murals, signs, and menu and plate designs for restaurants in various North American cities.
A 2019 exhibition, entitled "Fraaaandship!", at the Richard Taittinger Gallery in New York brought her additional visibility as the youngest artist at the gallery and the first to come from an Instagram background.
"Trust No Aunty" won the 2018 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize for humour.

The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show (1978 TV series)

The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show was a comedy sketch show originally produced by Thames Television and broadcast on the ITV network. The second show to be broadcast under the title, it was the fourth and final television series by English comedy double-act Morecambe and Wise, and saw their return to ITV after their successful nine-year association with the BBC.
History.
In January 1978, Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, just over four weeks after the broadcast of their successful 1977 Christmas Show on BBC1, which attracted an audience of just over 21m, announced that they had signed a contract with Thames Television to produce new shows for broadcast on ITV. This marked a return to commercial television for the pair, who between 1961 and 1968 had produced six series for ATV. While their time at the BBC had been both a critical and ratings success, Morecambe and Wise retained an ambition to make films. This was something that the BBC were not in a position to enable them to do, as, at the time, the Corporation did not have a motion picture production arm. Although evenly matched in the financial terms that were offered, it was the fact that Thames Television, through its film production company, Euston Films, were able to offer Morecambe and Wise the opportunity to make a film, that persuaded them to leave the BBC.
Although Thames succeeded in persuading Morecambe and Wise to move, they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get the various individuals that worked alongside the duo in their productions to also make the switch; Ernest Maxin, who had been their producer/director since 1975, declined to leave, while Eddie Braben had an exclusive contract and was unable to write for anyone outside the BBC. As a consequence, Thames needed to make other arrangements for the upcoming production of their first shows. Keith Beckett was recruited as producer, while Barry Cryer and John Junkin, who had written sketches for Morecambe and Wise at the BBC, were brought in to do the scripts for their upcoming shows. For the first year with Thames, there was no series planned, with instead a single introductory special, plus the Christmas show, the only shows to be broadcast in 1978, with a plan for a subsequent series.
In March 1979, Eric Morecambe suffered a second heart attack. Following a heart bypass operation, he was forced into an extended period of recuperation, with the result that there was no series that year, with their only appearance being a low-key Christmas special that was largely an extended interview with David Frost. By February 1980, Morecambe had regained his health sufficiently to start work on the first series for Thames. This saw the duo reunited with John Ammonds, their producer at the BBC from 1968 to 1974, who had agreed to take on the same role for them. Additionally, Ammonds had made an arrangement with Eddie Braben to come and write for them as soon as he was available at the end of his contract with the BBC. However, when the first series, which was eventually broadcast in September 1980, began, its running time had been reduced to 30 minutes, including a commercial break, which Braben found significantly more restrictive than the 45–50 minutes he had had at the BBC. The struggle that Braben had to come up with fresh material led to increasing reuse of old ideas, while both Morecambe and Wise appeared to be less enamoured either with the process or product of their work. Morecambe in particular had intimated that, after nearly forty years of working together, he wanted to do things away from the partnership. Although they continued to work, producing four series for Thames, by 1983, having completed work on both that year's series and the planned film, which was produced as "Night Train to Murder", Morecambe and Wise seemed agreed that the time had come to end their partnership.
Reception.
Although the show received healthy ratings from the beginning, they were never at the same level as they had during the latter years at the BBC. The 1978 Christmas Show received in the region of 1.5m fewer viewers than the record-breaking effort of the previous year, while critics were only mildly complementary, with one describing it as "a somewhat grey-haired show". Ratings continued to drop as the series progressed, eventually garnering between 11m to 14m by the fourth and final series. The final Christmas Show, broadcast on Boxing Day 1983, was watched by 11.2m viewers.
Aftermath.
By 1984, Eric Morecambe had determined to enter a period of semi-retirement, as, in spite of the success of his heart operation five years previously, there were still worries about the state of his health. Indeed, during production of the 1983 Christmas Show, the filming of a sequence had led to him spending two nights in hospital after his heart went out of rhythm. So, he sought to stop working and spend more time on things he enjoyed. This was especially the case with writing - he had completed and published a novel, "Mr Lonely", while convalescing after his operation, and had written two children's books, "The Reluctant Vampire" and "The Vampire's Revenge". During the beginning of 1984 he was completing a book about one of his other passions, fishing, and was in the process of writing a second adult novel. As the year progressed, concerns about his heart continued, to the extent that in May it was suggested he go for tests at the Harefield Hospital. He agreed to arrange this once he had completed some commitments over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend. It was during one of these, a light-hearted question and answer event with his friend Stan Stennett in Tewkesbury, that, on 27 May 1984, Morecambe suffered his third, and fatal, heart attack.
Unlike his partner, Ernie Wise had little desire to retire, seeking out opportunities to continue working; in 1985, he toured a one-man show in Australia, while in 1987 he made a return to the West End stage after forty-one years in a musical version of "The Mystery of Edwin Drood", before subsequently appearing in "Run For Your Wife", and writing an autobiography. He was also a regular panellist on the game show "What's My Line" (on which Morecambe had also made some of his last TV appearances in early 1984), as well as making several appearances in "Dictionary Corner" on "Countdown", and writing a column on gardening for the "News of the World". In 1993 he made his first appearance in pantomime without Morecambe, when he played the King in a production of "Sleeping Beauty" at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. The same year, he suffered the first of two strokes, the second of which, in 1995, led to him deciding to retire from showbusiness. In December 1998, he suffered two successive heart attacks in a week while on holiday in Florida, and underwent a triple heart bypass operation. Having been flown back to the UK, Wise died on 21 March 1999.
Home media releases.
In 1980, Thames released a pair of VHS tapes; the first was the complete 1980 Christmas show, while the other was a compilation from the three that Morecambe and Wise had produced for the company at that point.
The first shows from the Thames era, including the one-off special from 1978, seasonal shows from 1978 and 1980 and the David Frost programme from Christmas 1979 was released on DVD by the Network imprint on 11 April 2008 together with a second disc including the first series of Thames programmes from 1980. This was followed by a one-disc release, also by Network, which featured the three seasonal specials 1978-1980 only. No further plans have been announced by Network to release the final three series and seasonal specials broadcast during 1981–1983.

Synaptic stabilization

Synaptic stabilization is crucial in the developing and adult nervous systems and is considered a result of the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). The mechanism involves strengthening and maintaining active synapses through increased expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements and postsynaptic scaffold proteins, while pruning less active ones. For example, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a large role in synaptic maintenance and stabilization. Gerald Edelman discovered CAMs and studied their function during development, which showed CAMs are required for cell migration and the formation of the entire nervous system. In the adult nervous system, CAMs play an integral role in synaptic plasticity relating to learning and memory.
Types of CAMs.
SynCAMs.
Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in axon pathfinding and synaptic establishment between neurons during neurodevelopment and are integral members in many synaptic processes including the correct alignment of pre- and post-synaptic signal transduction pathways, vesicular recycling in regards to endocytosis and exocytosis, integration of postsynaptic receptors and anchoring to the cytoskeleton to ensure stability of synaptic components 
SynCAM’s (also known as Cadm or nectin-like molecules) are a specific type of synaptic CAM found in vertebrates that promotes growth and stabilization of excitatory (not inhibitory) synapses. SynCAM’s are localized primarily in the brain at both pre- and postsynaptic sites and their structures consist of intracellular FERM and PDZ binding domains, a single transmembrane domain, and three extracellular Ig-domains. During neurodevelopment, SynCAMs such as SynCAM1 act as “contact sensors” of axonal growth cones accumulating rapidly when axo-dendritic connections are made and helping to form a stable adhesion complex.
synCAM1 along with neuroligin are the two CAM’s known to be sufficient to initiate the formation of presynaptic terminals, as addition of synCAM1 to media of co-cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells lead to the establishment of presynaptic terminals. Homophillic binding of two synCAM1 molecules on the filopodia of axonal growth cone and dendritic spine allow for initial contact between pre- and postsynaptic cell to be made.
synCAMs belong to the Ig superfamily of proteins. The cytosolic PDZ domains of synCAMs imbedded in the post-synaptic membrane interact with post-synaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 which helps anchor the complex to the underlying cytoskeleton.
Cadherin-catenin.
Cadherins are calcium- dependent, homophilic cell adhesion molecules that form complexes with cytosolic partners known as catenins. Components of this complex bind to a number of different scaffolding proteins, phosphotases, kinases, and receptors. Classical cadherins have five extracellular repeating structures which bind calcium, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail with a distal cytosolic domain that binds a catenin partner. Recent work has implicated the cadherin-catenin complex in a number of different central nervous system processes such as synaptic stabilization and plasticity.
Many cadherins in the central nervous system exhibit distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns. For example, N-cadherin is widely expressed at the developing synapse and later remains near the mature active zone implicating that this complex may be well-suited to provide a link between structural changes and synaptic stability. In fact, local synaptic activity changes impact the expression of the cadherin-catenin complexes. An increase in activity at a particular spine leads to the dimerization of N-cadherin which is then cleaved leading the repression of CBP/CREB transcription. This repression has many developmental and plasticity related implications.
In the case of dendritic spine formation and pruning, a competition hypothesis has been proposed and corroborated. This hypothesis suggests that relative levels of cadherin-catenin complexes, which are distributed amongst spines in a local area in an activity-dependent manner, determines the fate of individual spines. That is, the inter-spine competition for β-catenin determines whether a spine will be matured (increased number of complexes) or pruned (decreased number of complexes). This is a critical mechanism during the refinement of cortical circuitry that occurs throughout development.
Nectin.
Nectins are a distinct family of cell adhesion molecules. These CAMs are involved in the initial contact of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal processes during synapse formation. There are only four well characterized nectins at the synapse, they are Nectin-1, 2, 3, and 4. All membrane-bound nectins possess an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like loops. The furthest loop from the membrane is called the V-type loop and the two loops more interior are C2-type loops. Multiple nectins on one cell membrane will bind together at the V-type loop to form a cluster of nectin proteins, a process called "cis-clustering". When two cells possessing individual cis-clusters come into contact they form a strong complex called a "trans-interaction" which provides adhesion and, in some cases, signaling between the two cells.
The most robust knowledge of nectin’s role in synaptic stabilization comes from the synapses made between mossy fiber terminals and pyramidal cell dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The nectins involved in formation and stabilization of this synapse are Nectin-1 and Nectin-3 which protrude from the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell and presynaptic cell, respectively, forming heterophilic extracellular contacts. The intracellular domain of all nectins directly bind to a protein called L-Afadin. L-Afadin is an actin binding protein that binds to the F-actin of the actin cytoskeleton. In this way, nectins form ridged connections of the cells actin architecture allowing for the synapse to develop in a controlled and stable environment.
As synapses mature in the CA3 region, nectins and cadherins, which affiliate closely with one another in synaptic stabilization, are shifted to the periphery of the active zone and form the puncta adherens junction (PAJ). The PAJ functions much like the adherens junctions in epithelial tissues. The displacement of these CAMs and the formation of this junction provides the nascent synaptic membranes room to interact and mature while partitioning off the surrounding membrane and providing cytoskeletal fixation.
Neurexin-neuroligin.
Neurexin-Neuroligin interactions help establish the trans-synaptic functional asymmetry essential for the stabilization and maintenance of proper synaptic transmission. Presynaptic neurexin and its postsynaptic binding partner, neuroligin, complex early in neural development and are both known to be potent inducers of synaptogenesis. Non-neuronal cells that artificially express neurexin are sufficient to mobilize post-synaptic specializations in co-cultured neurons; neuroligin-expressing cells are likewise able to induce markers of pre-synaptic differentiation in neighboring neurons. However, while both play an important role in synaptogenesis, these cell adhesion molecule are not necessary for formation of neuronal connections during development. A triple knockout mouse mutant of either neurexins or neuroligins exhibit a normal number of synapses but express an embryonic lethal phenotype due to impairment of normal synaptic transmission. Therefore, they are not necessary for synapse formation "per se" but are essential for the maturation and integration of synapses into the functional circuits necessary for survival.
Beyond their extracellular contact with each other, neurexins and neuroligins also bind intracellularly to a vast network of adaptor proteins and scaffolding structures, which in concert with the actin cytoskeleton, help localize necessary components of synaptic transmission. For example, the first neuroligin (NLGN1) discovered was identified by its PDZ domain which binds to PSD95, a well-known a scaffold protein at glutamatergic synapses that functionally links NMDA receptors to the proper post-synaptic locale. Similarly, another isoform of neuroligin (NLGN2) interacts with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein specific to GABA-ergic synapses, and is responsible for activation of the synaptic adapator protein collybistin. In the case of neurexins, their intracellular binding interactions are equally as important in recruiting the essential machinery for synaptic transmission at the active zone. Like neuroligins, neurexins possess a PDZ-domain that associates with CASK (Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase). In addition to phosphorylating itself and neurexin, CASK promotes interactions between neurexins and actin binding proteins, thus providing a direct link by which neurexin can modulate cytoskeletal dynamics that is essential for synaptic stability and plasticity. Neurexin can also bind synaptotagmin, a protein embedded in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, and can also promote associations with voltage-gated calcium channel which mediate the ion flux required for neurotransmitter exocytosis upon synaptic stimulation. In this way, neurexin and neuroligin coordinate the morphological and functional aspects of the synapse which in turn permits nascent, immature contacts to stabilize into full-fledged functional platforms for neurotransmission.
Ephrin-Eph signaling.
Non-traditional adhesion molecules, such as the ephrins, also help stabilize synaptic contacts. Eph receptors and their membrane bound ligands, the ephrins, are involved in a variety of cellular processes during development and maturation including axon guidance, neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and axon pruning. In the hippocampus, dendritic spine morphology may be regulated by astrocytes via bi-directional ephrin/EphA signaling. Astrocytes and their processes express ephrin A3, whereas the EphA4 receptor is enriched in hippocampal neurons. This interaction, mediated by ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling, induces the recruitment and activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which then phosphorylates the guanine exchange factor (GEF), ephexin1. Phosphorylated ephexin1 can then activate the small GTPase, RhoA, leading to subsequent activation of its effector, Rho-kinase (ROCK), which results in the rearrangement of actin filaments. Through this mechanism, astrocytic processes are able to stabilize individual dendritic protrusions as well as their maturation into spines via ephrin/EphA signaling. Forward signaling involving the activation of EphA4 results in the stabilization of synaptic proteins at the neuromuscular junction. As in the EphA4/ephrinA3-mediated neuron–glia interaction, this process regulates dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by activating ROCK through ephexin.
Ephrin B/EphB signaling is also involved in synaptic stabilization through different mechanisms. These molecules contain cytoplasmic tails which interact with scaffolding proteins via their PDZ domains to stabilize newly formed CNS synapses. For example, Ephrin B3 interacts with the adaptor protein glutamate-receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) to regulate the development of excitatory dendritic shaft synapses. This process, which was identified in cultures of hippocampal neurons, revealed that Eph/ephrin B3 reverse signaling recruits GRIP1 to the membrane of the postsynaptic shaft. Once at the membrane shaft, GRIP1 helps anchor glutamate receptors below the presynaptic terminal. This process also involves the phosphorylation of a serine residue near the ephrin-B carboxyl terminus (proximal to the PDZ-binding motif) that leads to the stabilization of AMPA receptors at synapses.
Another mechanism, found in hippocampal neurons, revealed that EphB signaling could promote spine maturation by modulating Rho GTPase activity, as observed with EphAs. Unlike EphAs, however, the EphB2 receptor has been shown to interact with the postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) to recruit the GEF Tiam1 to the complex upon ephrinB binding. Phosphorylation of Tiam1 occurs in response to NMDAR activity, which allows for the influx of calcium that activates Tiam1. This mechanism also results in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As a result of this stabilization, both EphB2 forward signaling and ephrin-B3 reverse signaling has been found to induce LTP via NMDARs.

Plot.
Arun meets Rajiv Mathur, the newly assigned welfare inspector of the Forest office at the station. Rajiv says that he is headed for Talpur. Arun informs him that Talpur is very far from that place and offers Arun his hospitality for that day. Rajiv arrives at his place and discovers that he is a rich person. Arun also discovers that Rajiv is carrying a flute with him. At night he requests Rajiv to play the flute. While playing the flute, they are interrupted by the sudden arrival of a beautiful young woman at his room. The young woman happens to be Lali, the younger sister of Arun. On the next day, He drops Rajiv to his allocated office.
Rajiv attends Lali's birthday party but is interrupted by Pyare, a servant at Arun's house, who informs him that a man from his provision has been severely bitten by a mad dog and immediately needs to be taken to the doctor. Just when Rajiv is about leave, Lali stalls him saying that it is simply Pyare's job to take the wounded man to the doctor. She continues saying that this whole thing is being done in order to spoil her birthday party. Rajiv is stunned at Lali's rudeness and openly declares that she is selfish who does not care for anyone except herself.
Lali once comes to visit Rajiv and apologises for her behaviour to him. Eventually she began to visit him and Rajiv slowly forms an affection towards her. Lali, one day inquires Rajiv as to whether he loves her. Rajiv initially fumbles but finally confesses to her his feelings. Lali also smartly declares that she is also in love with him. Arun arranges for Rajiv and Lali's wedding. In the meantime Lali once arrives at Rajiv's place but is unable find him there. She looks for him here and there and discovers him along with Mangli, his maid servant in a brook. Lali forms the prejudice that Rajiv has an illegitimate affair with Mangli and intends to marry her only because of her wealth. On the day of their wedding Lali fumes at Rajiv. She declares in front of everyone that she is no more willing to marry him as she thinks that he is a fraud and hypocrite.
Mangli comes to visit Lali and reveals that she accidentally fell into the brook and Rajiv luckily saved her life on the day she discovered them far from the top of the hill. A repentant Lali, once again arrives at Rajiv's place but discovers that Rajiv has left without any information about where he has headed to. Gradually, Lali becomes dejected and to find solace she goes on a pilgrimage. Once standing on the bank of a river, she feels that her life has come to a meaningless term. Feeling guilty, she flings herself into the river but is saved by some of the people who were present at that moment. When she regains her consciousness, she meets an elderly woman to whom she tells everything about her life. Now that woman endeavours to reinstate her faith and hope. Coincidentally Rajiv appears and it is discovered that he is the son of that woman. Lali fails to restrain her tears and falls at his feet. Rajiv forgives her and they reunite.

1989 UK Athletics Championships

The 1989 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Monkton Stadium, Jarrow. It was the first time that the event was held in North East England. The men's 10,000 metres was dropped from the programme and replaced by a 3000 metres event. Strong winds affected the jumps programme and several of the sprint races.
It was the thirteenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1989 AAA Championships.
Shot putter Judy Oakes won a sixth straight title and women's 400 m hurdler Elaine McLaughlin made it three consecutive wins for her. Three other athletes defended their 1988 UK titles: Ian McCombie (racewalk), Steve Backley (javelin) and Linda Keough (400 m). Liz McColgan won the women's 3000 metres, having been 5000 metres champion the previous year. Marcus Adam was the only athlete to win multiple titles that year, taking a men's short sprint double.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1989 IAAF World Cup, where the men's team competed and women competed as part of the European team. Reflecting the secondary nature of the UK event, most of the individual British medallists at the World Cup did not compete here. Among those that did were Colin Jackson (hurdles runner-up), Stewart Faulkner (long jump bronze medallist), Jonathan Edwards (triple jump bronze medallist) and Steve Backley (javelin champion).

Rubin 9.2 is a German experimental satellite payload launched on 23 September 2009 in 06:21 aboard PSLV-CA rocket at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in India. Rubin 9.2 shares the host satellite Rubin-9 with another payload, Rubin 9.1. The Rubin-9 "satellite" (COSPAR 2009-051F) was actually the upper stage of the carrier rocket to which the payloads were solidly bolted onto; after the rocket had finished its mission with the primary payload, the upper stage remained in space and became "satellite" Rubin-9. Rubin 9.2 was developed by OHB System to continue their series of AIS receiver experiments that they had performed on previous Rubin-flights. AIS is a network used to find shipping vessels and identify them. Non-operational as of 2019, its orbit was 792 * 712 km, at 98°.

Kansas City Jazz Orchestra

The Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is a not-for-profit 501c(3) big band jazz orchestra based in the Kansas City metropolitan area and part of the Kansas City jazz music scene.
History.
The Kansas City Jazz Orchestra was founded by Jim Mair and Gene Hall in Kansas City in May 2003 after being inspired by similar jazz orchestras across the United States, though it was primarily modeled after the Columbus Jazz Orchestra. Jim's wife, Mary Mair, was also integral in getting the orchestra started. Mary Mair took the helm as the first Executive Director.
The Kansas City Jazz Orchestra had their debut performance was in 2003. They began with theme-based concerts and a two-concert subscription season.
In the beginning of the orchestra's performing schedule, they regularly drew audiences of up to 1,000 people. "Our vision for the Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is to be on the same cultural plane as the symphony, the ballet, and the Lyric opera," said Mair when elaborating on a strategy to grow the Orchestra and attract young audiences and musicians," said Mair. To that end, the orchestra incorporated youth outreach and education into their strategy. They co-sponsored the 3rd annual Kansas City Kansas Community College Jazz Camp and held clinics at Kansas City schools.
By 2008, the orchestra was an 18-piece band. They connected with audiences through their tributes to Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Mel Tormé, Woody Herman, and even Kansas City jazz great Count Basie. They had played at Unity Temple on the Kansas City Plaza for most of their concerts, but after 5 years they grew to the Folly Theater as well. As of 2018, the concert season is held at the large Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.
Since spring of 2013 the orchestra is directed by Clint Ashlock, who succeeded Kerry Strayer.
The orchestra embarked on its first international tour in May 2018, performing at the Swinging Hannover festival in Germany and other concerts in Poland.

L'Auberge rouge (short story)

L'Auberge rouge (English "The Red Inn") is a short story by Honoré de Balzac. It was published in 1831 and is one of the "Études philosophiques" of "La Comédie humaine".
Background.
The plot was inspired by a story told to Balzac by a former army surgeon, whose friend had been unjustly tried and executed.
Plot summary.
The story is told in the first person by an unnamed narrator. He attends a dinner party in Paris. A German guest named Hermann is asked to tell a story.
Hermann's story occurs in 1799 in Andernach on the Rhine in Germany. At that time it was occupied by France. Two young French doctors from Beauvais arrive in the town to serve with the French regiment stationed there. They arrange to spend the night at an inn called the Red Inn, because of its colour. A German businessman named Walhenfer also arrives there to spend the night. The inn is full, and the only place for the three new arrivals to spend the night is in the main dining room. Over dinner Walhenfer confesses to the two young doctors that he is carrying a bag full of gold and diamonds. Hermann remembers that the name of one of the French doctors is Prosper Magnan, but cannot remember the other's name.
During that night Magnan thinks about murdering Walhenfer, and running away with his valuables. He actually gets a knife out of his surgical bag to perform this. But he has second thoughts, and leaves the inn to go for a walk. After walking for some time, he returns to the inn and goes to bed. When he wakes up in the early morning, he finds that Walhenfer has been beheaded with his surgical knife. Magnan faints and falls into the pool of blood. When he wakes again he has been arrested by the French soldiers. Magnan's friend and Walhenfer's valuables are both missing, however because Magnan is covered in blood and his own knife was used, the soldiers suspect that Magnan is the murderer. Magnan was also seen walking outside, and is suspected of having buried Walhenfer's treasure.
Magnan is sent to the town's prison, and it is there that he meets Hermann, who is under arrest for trying to start a rebellion against the French. Magnan tells Hermann everything that has happened, and says that he is innocent. However at the court martial, he is found guilty, and is executed.
Whilst Hermann has been telling this story, the narrator notices that another guest, a wealthy man named Frederic Taillefer has been very agitated. The narrator suspects that Taillefer is the unnamed doctor in Hermann's story, especially when Hermann belatedly remembers that the other doctor was named Frederic. The narrator asks Taillefer if he is from Beauvais, and Taillefer confirms that he is. Taillefer then tries to avoid the narrator. The narrator has in the meantime fallen in love with a girl that he has seen at the party, and is shocked to discover that she is Taillefer's daughter Victorine.
After the party, the narrator continues to court Victorine, and occasionally also see her father. The narrator is then in a dilemma, and hosts a dinner party to which he invites 17 of his friends to ask them whether he should marry Victorine, even though he believes her father is a murderer. After explaining the problem they hold a secret ballot to determine whether he should marry her. They vote 9 to 8 against. However, the narrator is suspicious that the 9 against votes were from his younger friends who wish to marry Victorine themselves. The story concludes with one of the older guests telling the narrator that he was foolish to ask Taillefer whether he was from Beauvais.
Recurring characters.
The Taillefers also appear in the novel "Père Goriot".
Adaptation.
The story was the basis for a French film version in 1923, directed by Jean Epstein. The films of the same name of 1951 and 2007 are based on unrelated events at Auberge rouge.

Sevira daughter of Maximus

Sevira (a Vulgar Latin spelling of the Classical Latin name "Severa") is purported daughter of the Roman Emperor Magnus Maximus and wife of Vortigern mentioned on the fragmentary, mid-ninth century C.E. Latin inscription of the Pillar of Eliseg near Valle Crucis Abbey, Denbighshire, Wales.
The inscription was commissioned by Cyngen ap Cadell (died 855), king of Powys, in honour of his great-grandfather Elisedd ap Gwylog, who is here claimed to be a descendant of "Britu son of Vortigern, whom Germanus blessed, and whom Sevira bore to him, daughter of Maximus the king, who killed the king of the Romans."
The Pillar of Eliseg inscription is the only known source for a daughter of Magnus Maximus named Sevira (or Severa).

EMRBots

EMRBots are experimental artificially generated electronic medical records (EMRs). The aim of EMRBots is to allow non-commercial entities (such as universities) to use the artificial patient repositories to practice statistical and machine-learning algorithms. Commercial entities can also use the repositories for any purpose, as long as they do not create software products using the repositories.
A letter published in Communications of the ACM emphasizes the importance of using synthetic medical data, "... EMRBots can generate a synthetic patient population of any size, including demographics, admissions, comorbidities, and laboratory values. A synthetic patient has no confidentiality restrictions and thus can be used by anyone to practice machine learning algorithms."
Background.
EMRs contain sensitive personal information. For example, they may include details about infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or they may contain information about a mental disorder. They may also contain other sensitive information such as medical details related to fertility treatments. Because EMRs are subject to confidentiality requirements, accessing and analyzing EMR databases is a privilege given to only a small number of individuals. Individuals who work at institutions that do not have access to EMR systems have no opportunity to gain hands-on experience with this valuable resource. Simulated medical databases are currently available; however, they are difficult to configure and are limited in their resemblance to real clinical databases. Generating highly accessible repositories of artificial patient EMRs while relying only minimally on real patient data is expected to serve as a valuable resource to a broader audience of medical personnel, including those who reside in underdeveloped countries.
Academic use.
In April 2018 Bioinformatics (journal) published a study that relied on EMRBots data to create a new R package denoted as "comoRbidity". Co-authors on the study included scientists from Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Harvard University. The repositories have been used to accelerate research, e.g., researchers from Michigan State University, IBM Research, and Cornell University published a study in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference. Their study describes a novel neural network that performs better than the widely used long short-term memory neural network developed by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1997. In May 2018 scientists from IBM Research and Cornell University have used the repositories to test a new deep architecture denoted as Health-ATM. To demonstrate superiority over traditional neural networks, they applied their architecture to a congestive heart failure use case. Additional use includes The University of Chicago creating a highly-detailed tutorial demonstrating how to use R using the repositories, University of California Merced, and The University of Tampere, Finland. Additional resources include.
In March 2019 the repositories were used to enhance "Computationally-Enabled Medicine", a course given by Harvard Medical School. Further in March, scientists from multiple institutions, including Peking University, University of Tokyo, and Polytechnic University of Milan used the repositories to develop a new framework focused on medical information privacy.
Use in hackathons.
Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University used EMRBots data at the CMU HackAuton hackathon to create a prediction tool. Additional uses are available.
EMRBots were presented at HackPrinceton 2018 organized by Princeton University.
EMRBots were presented at TreeHacks 2019 organized by Stanford University.
Availability.
The repositories can be downloaded after registration.
The repositories are available to download from Figshare without registration.
Full source code for creating the repositories is available to download from Figshare.
All source code for EMRBots is available in Elsevier's Software Impacts GitHub site.
Northwell Health's EMRBot.
In May 2018 Northwell Health funded a project denoted as EMRBot in the health system's third annual innovation challenge. Northwell Health's EMRBot, however, is neither related to Uri Kartoun's website (registered as a domain name in April 2015; www.emrbots.org) nor to any of its repositories or applications.
Criticism.
"[EMRBots] are ... pregenerated datasets of synthetic EHR with an insufficient explanation of how the datasets were generated. These datasets exhibit several inconsistencies between health problems, age, and gender." An additional criticism is described in a thesis ("Realism in Synthetic Data Generation") granted by Massey University.

Political career.
Prior to contesting the legislative elections of 2001, Lu served three terms on the Hualien County Council. His victory over Michael You in the legislative primaries held that April was considered unexpected, and subsequently he was elected to represent the Hualien County district in December. Shortly after taking office in February 2002, Lu received a single vote in a speakership election won by Wang Jin-pyng. The next year, Lu led You's campaign as he contested the Hualien County magistracy. As leader of the Democratic Progressive Party's campaign headquarters, Lu coordinated party efforts on behalf of its 2004 presidential ticket. During Lu's first term, he supported the establishment of direct flights between Hualien Airport and Seoul. In November 2004, Lu proposed that freeing captured animals be prohibited, to prevent commercialization of the release.
Lu was again named a DPP legislative candidate in 2004, and was reelected alongside Fu Kun-chi. Lu backed the construction of a freeway between Hualien and Yilan during his second term in office. The DPP nominated Lu as its candidate for the Hualien County magisterial election in 2005. He lost the contest to Hsieh Shen-shan. Lu ran for legislative reelection in 2008, losing to Fu Kun-chi.

Jason Flores-Williams

Jason Flores-Williams (born 1969, Los Angeles, CA) is an author, political activist, and civil rights attorney. He is best known for his legal work on behalf of death row clients, political protesters, the homeless population of Denver, and his suit to have the Colorado River recognized as a legal person. Flores-Williams is an acknowledged expert in conspiracy law and First Amendment cases whose views are frequently sought by media organizations, including the "Washington Post", the "New York Times", and the "Los Angeles Times". He was also a lead organizer of the protests against the 2004 Republican National Convention. He lives in Denver, Colorado.
Biography.
Jason Flores-Williams' parents are Camille Flores, a New Mexican journalist and newspaper editor, and Drake Williams, a CPA and small business owner. He was raised in Texas outside of Houston. In the early 1980s, he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico with his family. There, his father was convicted along with his twin brother of involvement with illicit drug trafficking and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. After his father's conviction, Flores-Williams dropped out of high school and moved to Washington, DC, where he self-educated at the Library of Congress and got his GED. He spent the late 80s living in Harlem across from the Apollo Theater, and graduated from Hunter College at CUNY with an honor's degree in Philosophy. He spent the early 90s in Prague where he wrote and worked as the first pizza delivery boy in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. He later moved to San Francisco to focus on writing. He is the grandson of William Flores,
one of the founding fathers of League of United Latin American Citizens.
Literary career.
After moving to San Francisco, Flores-Williams' first book was "End of the West". Published in 1996, it describes his bohemian lifestyle in the city. His follow up novel, "Last Stand of Mr. America" was a called "a ferocious portrait of a San Francisco public relations yuppie who lives a double life in underground sex clubs seeking salvation and meaning" and Flores-Williams was called "an all-American outlaw and edge-walker in the tradition of Jack Kerouac, Charles Bukowski, and Biggie Smalls" by novelist David Gates.
He was also helped start the Litstock festival. After traveling to Scotland to get a 2nd edition of the novel published in 2004, Flores-Williams moved to New York where he became a blogger for High Times.
Activism and legal career.
In the September/October 2004 edition of High Times entitled, "How to get Arrested," Jason Flores-Williams wrote the lead article entitled, "A Call to Resistance," a guide for people looking to protest the 2004 Republican National Convention In May 2004, he was arrested leading a die-in staged on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to protest the invasion of Iraq by the US. After the convention protests, Flores-Williams became disillusioned with protest politics and completed his J.D. degree at Rutgers Law School.
After graduating from law school, Flores-Williams worked for the Capital Appeals Project representing indigent clients on death row in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. He moved back to Santa Fe, and represented US fugitive from justice and former Republic of New Afrika member Charlie Hill in his attempts to prevent his extradition from Cuba to face murder charges for the alleged killing a police officer. Hill was eventually allowed by the Cuban government to remain in the country and not extradited to the US. He also represented a Vietnam Veteran suffering from PTSD who was denied benefits from the Veterans Administration because he lived in Cuba, which the veteran eventually lost.
After moving to Denver, Flores-Williams represented a group of homeless people living in Denver in a class-action lawsuit seeking an end to the city's practice of confiscating their property and the clearing their encampments from the city streets. It was alleged that the city had used flamethrowers to burn the homeless people's possessions after the raids and held a BBQ where the sweeps had occurred. Class-action status for the homeless people suing the city was initially denied, but was ultimately approved. Three of the homeless people who were a part of the lawsuit were convicted of violating the city's ordinance on camping.
After the mass arrests at the DisruptJ20 during the Inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, Flores-Williams was the attorney for the first three defendants facing charges of property destruction or assaults on police.
In September 2017, Flores-Williams filed a controversial lawsuit on behalf of the Colorado River claiming that the river is a legal person and suing the state of Colorado and current Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper "for violating the river’s 'right to exist, flourish, regenerate, be restored, and naturally evolve.'" The lawsuit was eventually dismissed with prejudice by Flores-Williams due to the threat of legal sanctions from the Colorado Attorney General's Office who stated, "the case itself unacceptably impugned the State’s sovereign authority to administer natural resources for public use, and was well beyond the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of government." Flores-Williams stated regarding the dismissal, “Situations change, and what is best for the rights of nature movement is not to get involved in a lengthy sanctions battle, but to move forward with seeking environmental justice.”
The 2020 Colorado Avalanche Case.
In March of 2020, two Colorado snowboarders, Tyler DeWitt and Evan Hannibal, accidentally triggered an avalanche that led to the temporary closure of a road in rural Summit County. Although nobody was injured in the avalanche, local prosecutors charged DeWitt and Hannibal the following month with reckless endangerment and sought $168,000 in restitution. Both defendants pled not guilty and announced their intention to fight the charges. As the lawyer representing the two men, Flores-Williams put the state on the defensive, forcing Colorado state District Attorney Bruce Brown to wade into the case to publicly defend the prosecution. In addition to being unjust on their merits, Flores-Williams attacked the charges as potentially setting a dangerous precedent related to the regulation of recreation and sporting activities throughout the state and beyond. The charges, Flores-Williams said, were 
"an attempt to send a chilling message and criminalize the backcountry. In taking these cases, our goal is not simply to prevail, but also to stop that message from being sent. In our minds, there are certain zones that we cannot let the state enter into and limit the few liberties and freedoms we have left."
Mexico City Office and International Criminal Law Practice.
In 2020, Flores-Williams opened a law office in downtown Mexico City. His first international office is focused on protecting the rights of Mexican nationals charged with drug offenses in the U.S. legal system. Flores-Williams is descended from Mexican heritage on his father’s side, whose arrest and abuse at the hands of the U.S.-led “war on drugs” continues to inspire and guide his life’s work. Flores-Williams described what he calls “the family tradition of the fight for justice” in conversation with the Mexican newspaper "Pie en Pagina",
"International problems require international solutions. That is why we seek to bring litigation on a large scale, to federal courts in the United States and the rest of the world, with multi-jurisdictional operations. I am fighting injustice and I want to spend the rest of my life fighting for it, for a better world, for an even floor." 
The Mexico City office.collaborates with human rights groups throughout Latin America. Along with enforcing currently established rights, the strategic mission of the Mexico City office is to assert rights for rights-less people through litigation that synthesizes American constitutional and international law.

Young Nicholas (1798 ship)

Young Nicholas was built in Holland in 1790 under another name. The British captured her in 1798 and Prinsep &amp; Saunders purchased her and named her "Young Nicholas". She made one voyage under license from the British East India Company (EIC) that resulted in legal difficulties. Next she had a short, unsuccessful cruise as a privateer that resulted in a French privateer capturing her in a single-ship action, but then releasing her. Lastly, she made a third cruise that resulted in French privateer capturing her, the Royal Navy recapturing her, and her being wrecked in a hurricane. This cruise too resulted in legal difficulties culminating in a notable court case.
Career.
"Young Nicholas" entered "Lloyd's Register" ("LR") in 1798 with D. Ferris, master, Prinsep &amp; Co., owners, and trade London-Cape of Good Hope. However, "Young Nicholas"s first voyage, in 1798, was to St Petersburg. In September she was at Elsinore, and by end-September had returned to Elsinore from there.
Cape of Good Hope.
Captain Daniel Ferris acquired a letter of marque on 16 January 1799. However, Captain Richard Silby (or Tilby), acquired one on 26 January.
"Young Nicholas" arrived at the Cape on 12 June 1799. It is not clear what "Young Nicholas" did between her arrival in June and early 1800. She is recorded as arriving again at the Cape from Saldanha Bay on 18 January 1800.
However, in early 1800 Messrs. Walker and Peters purchased 367 bags of Java coffee and one case of gum Benjamin at a prize court sale of the cargo of the Danish ship "Christianus Septimus". They also purchased three cases of bandannoes and three cases of tamarinds from the prize cargo of the American ship "Pacific". Walker and Peters loaded their purchases aboard "Young Nicholas" as she was preparing to sail to England. However, they could not get permission to export their purchases and requested that they be allowed to unload the cargo and put it under the "King's Locks" until they could the authorities could advise on its export or disposal. They received permission to land the goods.
However, Henry James Jessup, Chief Searcher of His Majesty's Customs at the Cape, on the advice of Peter Mosse, Advocate, requested that W.S. van Ryneveld, the King's Fiscal, detain "Young Nicholas" and seize the cargo that had come from "Christianus Septimus". Because "Christianus Septimus" had been ruled not a prize, her carrying cargo from east of the Cape, to wit, Batavia, to England represented a violation of the British East India company's monopoly. When the goods were landed, Jessup seized them. The merchants involved had the authorization under a law of colony to ship them to England. Charges and counter-charges were made, and several people were relieved of their offices, Jessup among them. They then sailed to England.
The government in May 1800 chartered "Young Nicholas" for a year in what appeared to have been a highly irregular arrangement. The government agreed with Walker &amp; Robertson to a charter at rate of £1200 per month. Walker &amp; Robertson agreed a parallel charter with captain Selby on a rate of £591 per month. The only other difference between the two charters was that the value in case of the loss of "Young Nicholas" was stated as £6000 on the charter to the government, and £4000 on the parallel charter to Walker and Robertson.
Next, "Young Nicholas" was one of 28 vessels that left England between December 1800 and February 1801 to bring back rice from the Cape of Good Hope or beyond. The EIC had a monopoly on such trade and the vessels and sailed under charter to it. Prinsep &amp; Saunders alone tendered 15 vessels, including "Young Nicholas", Richard Silby, master.
The government took up "Young Nicholas" at the Cape in early November 1802 to transport 160 to 170 tons of cannon and some officers and 250 invalids to Spithead. Lieutenant Street, the agent for transports, was placed in charge of her. "Young Nicholas" arrived at Portsmouth on 18 February 1803. The report of her arrival described her as a hired armed transport under the command of Lieutenant B. Street, and bringing ordnance stores, 200 invalids, and some passengers. Actually, the invalids she had embarked numbered 193 men, 20 men, and 15 children, the women and children presumably the dependents of the men.
Privateer.
In June 1803, after the resumption of war with France, "Young Nicholas" became a privateer, with Captain John Cunditt acquiring a letter of marque.
On 7 July "Young Nicholas" encountered the French privateer , of 22 guns and 100 men. The ensuing engagement lasted an hour and a half before "Young Nicholas" struck after she had suffered four men killed. Captain Aregnaudeau of "Blonde" gave "Young Nicholas" up to Captain Cunditt and his crew in recognition of their "courageous Conduct", and she arrived at Penzance on the 29th.
Last voyage.
On 3 September 1803 Prinsep &amp; Co. and Hunter signed a charter party. "Young Nicholas" was to sail to Honduras to gather mahogany, 60 tons of dye wood, and logwood or fustic. She gathered 200,000 feet of wood and sailed for London on 29 March 1804. A storm on 21 April so damaged "Young Nicholas" that she had to put into port to effectuate repairs.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 29 May that "Young Nicholas" had been parted with off Charleston in a leaky state. She intended to put into Charleston. "Lloyd's List" reported about a month later that "Young Nicholas", Henry, master, had put into Savannah in distress. She was reported to be sailing from Honduras to London. To pay for the necessary repairs "Young Nicholas"s master sold part of her cargo.
"Young Nicholas", Horry, master, sailed from Savannah on 8 July. The next day a French privateer captured her and sent her to Guadeloupe. Eventually, Captain Horry arrived at Liverpool in "Daphne".
On 6 August, recaptured "Young Nicholas", which was laden with mahogany. "Hippomenes" sent her into St Kitts.
On 3 September 1804 a hurricane at St Kitts drove her ashore, wrecking her. She was one of five ships and several small craft that the hurricane destroyed. All crews were saved.
Court case.
When "Young William" came in to St Kitts as a prize, the Vice admiralty court ordered her sold, together with her cargo. Captain Horry/Henry then brought the proceeds home with him and passed them to Princep &amp; Saunders, who deducted freight charges from them. The owners of the cargo sued for the return of the freight charges. The charter party specified that one-third of the freight was due on the cargo's arrival in England, and two-thirds some 90 days later. The court agreed with the plaintiff, Hunter, that as the cargo had not arrived in England no freight was due and so Prinsep &amp; Saunders were required to refund the charges.

 is a hot spring resort in the city of Kaga, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. It is one of the largest in the three prefectures which constitute the Hokuriku region of Japan.
The "onsen" has one hotel and 31 "ryokan."
History.
Yamashiro Onsen has a very ancient history, and there are several myths about its foundation.
One story attributes it to the wandering Buddhist monk Gyōki in the Nara period who discovered the springs while following an injured crow and seeing it bathe in the hot waters.
During the Heian period it developed as part of a Buddhist temple called , dedicated to Yakushi Nyorai, the Buddha of medicine. It was patronised in the Sengoku period by Akechi Mitsuhide and was visited in the Meiji period by numerous literary personages.
After World War II, it developed due it its ease of access to Osaka and Kyoto.

Caroline Barker (artist)

Caroline Barker (1894–1988) was an Australian artist. She is best known for her portraits and still life. The Museum of Brisbane (formerly Brisbane's Civic Art Gallery) holds a large collection of her works.
Early life.
Caroline Barker was born on 8 September 1894 in Ascot Vale, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
She commenced her art studies at the art school at the Melbourne Art Gallery (now the National Gallery of Victoria) where she studied painting with Bernard Hall and drawing with Frederick McCubbin. There she was awarded second prize for her monochrome painting in 1917, which provided her with a year's free tuition, enabling her to complete her studies in 1919.
Due to her father's ill-health, the family relocated to Brisbane in Queensland in 1920. From 1921 to 1922, Barker became an art teacher at the Ipswich Girls Grammar School, saving her money in order to continue her studies in England.
She continued her studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in Piccadilly, London under Frederick Cayley Robinson and Charles Sims, where she also studied anatomy and the chemistry of painting, and then at the Byam Shaw School of Art under Vicat Cole. During this period her works were added to the collections of the Royal Academy, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Paris Salon and the Byam Shaw.
Artist career.
Barker returned to Brisbane in November 1926. Initially she worked in the studios of Vida Lahey and Daphne Mayo before establishing her own studio in George Street.
In 1928, Barker painted a portrait of Lord Mayor of Brisbane William Jolly in his mayoral robes and exhibited it at the Royal Queensland Art Society. Charles Herbert Gough was so impressed by the work that he initiated a public subscription to purchase the portrait as a gift for the mayor from the citizens of Brisbane. As Jolly was a popular mayor, the public were generous in their donations and the portrait was presented to the mayor in December 1928.
Two of her works were used by The Queenslander newspaper for their colour covers, one of poinsettias in 1930 and another of gerbras and bougainvillea in 1931.
Barker taught art at a number of schools including Somerville House (1935-1946), Loreto College Coorparoo, Clayfield College, and St Margaret's Anglican Girls' School and at her own home. Her students include many notable artists including:
Later life.
Barker died on 23 July 1988 at South Brisbane.

Frances Phoenix

Frances Phoenix (née Budden) (1950–2017) was an Australian feminist artist known for needlework and poster designs. Phoenix contributed to both Sydney and Adelaide's Women's Art Movements and multiple community art projects. With Marie McMahon, she was a founding member of the Women's Domestic Needlework Group and contributed to Judy Chicago's "The Dinner Party" (1974–1979). She continued to study and practice art for the rest of her life. Her needlework and poster designs are held in national collections.
Biography.
Phoenix was born in 1950. She originally studied to become a teacher at the National Art School and Alexander Mackie Teacher’s College, Sydney. In 1974, she joined Australia's first Women's Art Movement, based in Sydney. Around this time, Phoenix began experimentations with domestic needlework, generating central core imagery, Australiana and activist slogans in stitch. With Marie McMahon, Phoenix began a doily archive, researching the history of women's needlework and running women's needlework classes at Sydney University's Tin Sheds. With Joan Grounds, Bernadette Krone, Kathy Letray, Patricia McDonald, Noela Taylor and Loretta Vieceli, McMahon and Phoenix formed the Women's Domestic Needlework collection, preparing the archive for a touring exhibition, beginning at Watters Gallery, Sydney. The group supplemented the exhibition with research in "Lip," two publications: "The D’oyley Show: An Exhibition of Women’s Domestic Fancywork" and "Work for Dainty Fingers" and a series of 10 screenprinted posters. With Marie McMahon, Phoenix travelled to the United States of America to contribute needlework skills to Judy Chicago's "The Dinner Party" (1974–79). Phoenix' account of the experience is detailed in her publication "Our story/Herstory? Working on Judy Chicago's Dinner Party." While in Sydney, Phoenix was also a founding member of Matilda Graphics and the local feminist arts publication "F/Arts".
In the early 1980s, Phoenix joined the Adelaide Women's Art Movement. She spearheaded multiple community art projects including "Double our Numbers" and "The Alchemists' Teaparty". She continued to study throughout her life, completing a masters degree in visual art on "The critical corpse : re-(inter)preting the abject dead animal in visual art" at the University of South Australia.

String Quartet No. 1 (Enescu)

The String Quartet No. 1 in E-flat major, Op. 22, No. 1, is a chamber music work by the Romanian violinist and composer George Enescu, composed between 1916 and 1920. A performance of it lasts about 45 minutes.
History.
The dates of composition of the First String Quartet are known with unusual precision: Enescu began work on it at midnight of the (orthodox) Romanian New Year, 14 January 1916, at the Villa Copou in Iași. After interruptions resulting from the entry of Romania into the First World War, he resumed work on the quartet in 1918, only to break off again until the summer of 1920. He completed the score in Switzerland on 1 December 1920 at Le Châtelet, a house in Vers-chez-les-Blanc (Lausanne) owned by . The work was first performed on 5 February 1921 at the Lausanne Conservatory Hall by a quartet consisting of the composer on viola, , first violin, R. Radrizzani, second violin, and Jean Décosterd, cello, in a concert devoted to Enescu's chamber music which also included the Second Piano Suite played by Clara Haskil. Subsequent performances took place at the Romanian Athenaeum in Bucharest on 21, 28, and 31 May 1921, with the composer playing first violin, second violin, Teodor Popovici viola, and Nicolae Ochialbi cello.
Although the published score does not bear a dedication, the quartet is said to be dedicated to the Flonzaley Quartet (, Alfred Pochon, Louis Bailly, and Iwan d'Archambeau), who gave the first Paris performance at the Salle Gaveau in Paris on 19 October 1921.)
Analysis.
The quartet is in four movements:
This is an exceptionally long and thematically complex work, in which Enescu transmutes traditional structures, requiring repeated hearings if listeners are to keep their bearings. Because of its constantly changing lines, harmonic mobility, and textural complexity, the Quartet demands a great deal from the listener, ranking among the most difficult works of an especially difficult composer. In short, it is precisely because of the composer's wealth of invention on the levels of form, melody, rhythm, timbre, and harmony, that this work is not best suited as an introduction to Enescu's music.
The first movement is in sonata-allegro form, though Enescu’s characteristic use of evolutionary processes and transformations results in the inclusion of some developmental passages within the exposition, as well as continuous variation of the melodic material there. 
The main theme is presented at the outset, over a pedal E in the cello, but moves quickly on to the keys of C major and F minor, in a series of developing variations. The secondary theme, by contrast, is only unfolded gradually, starting in b. 15, building up from motivic fragments to a complete statement of the theme at rehearsal number 8, at first in the expected dominant key of B major, but then turning to the dominant's relative key of G minor. A seemingly insignificant, accompanimental thematic element, which will become more important in the quartet's later movements, occurs between the two main theme groups and may be regarded either as a bridge passage, or as a part of the first group's texture.

Jenny Watson (artist)

Jennifer Watson (born 1951) is an Australian artist known for her paintings that combine text and images.
Biography.
Jenny Watson was born in Melbourne in 1951 and she lives and works in Samford, Queensland. Her formative years as an artist were in the 1970s in Melbourne and London. In 1972, she completed a Diploma of Painting at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, Melbourne. In 1973, she completed a Diploma of Education at the State College of Victoria. She had her first solo show in 1973.
Early influences on her practice include conceptual art, feminism and the punk scene in London and Melbourne. Uniquely, her work takes these influences into the domain of figurative painting. She has developed her own visual language that frequently combines text with images. She currently mentors at Queensland College of Art, Griffith University.
Career.
Watson came to prominence in Australia during the 1980s, a period in Australian art history when the relationship between word and image, painting and photography, and art and popular culture were important themes. Her work is part of this investigation of ideas about visual representation that characterised conceptualism and critical postmodernism. Both conceptualism and critical postmodernism stress distancing from the subject matter they represent, whether through deadpan presentation of material or an ironic tone, in contrast Watson's practice frequently suggests an intimate or personal approach to her material.
Watson said of her approach: “I quickly realised that being a serious woman artist was not unusual, and with that possibility established, it allowed me to develop the work more radically, away from figuration towards philosophical, conceptual practice, and ultimately towards my own autobiographical take.”
Watson's work has been described as confessional by art historian Benedikt Stegmayer thereby positioning her work alongside the work of younger artists such as Tracey Emin. In Watson's work it is unclear whether the paintings are autobiographical or not.
In 1993, she represented Australia at the 45th Venice Biennale. In 2017 a major survey of her work was shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney and Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne.

Remind Me to Forget

"Remind Me to Forget" is a song recorded by Norwegian record producer Kygo, featuring guest vocals from American singer Miguel. Written by David Phelan, Alex Oriet, Phil Plested and produced by Kygo, it was released on 16 March 2018 by Sony Music, Ultra Music and RCA Records, as the third and final single from Kygo's second studio album, "Kids in Love" (2017). The song was featured in the movie trailer for the 2019 film, Five Feet Apart.
Release and composition.
On 8 March 2018, a short clip of the song first surfaced on the internet. On 10 March 2018, Kygo announced the song on Instagram and Facebook with a series of promotional photos. "Remind Me to Forget" is a midtempo electro, tropical house and R&amp;B track about "learning to let go of a love lost".
Critical reception.
Shanté Honeycutt of "Billboard" noted the song's potential to become "a summer dance jam", regarding it as a memorable song despite the title, writing: "Kygo's lighthearted production is a match for Miguel's powerhouse vocals". Kevin Goddard of HotNewHipHop called the song "another strong addition to both artist's growing catalog of hits", writing that it features an "uptempo and infectious dance-friendly production from Kygo", on which "Miguel shows off his vocals". Similarly, "Essence"s Rachaell Davis wrote that "the song features Miguel delivering his signature vocals over an infectious beat". Artistdirect deemed the song a mixture of Kygo's "upbeat tropical house sound" and "Miguel's seductive and sultry vocals", resulting in "an endlessly-playable melody". "Rap-Up" described the collaboration as "dance floor-ready", on which Miguel's "soothing" vocals are backed by "Kygo's melodic, pulsing instrumental". Karlie Powell of Your EDM opined that the song "bridges the gap between EDM and mainstream", as the two artists "play off each other's styles for a straight up unforgettable result".
Music video.
The Colin Tilley-directed music video for "Remind Me to Forget" was released on 6 May 2018 on Kygo's official YouTube channel. It features Miguel, a piano-playing Kygo, and a female ballerina performing in separate rooms of a house during some kind of cataclysm, with walls and furnishings being destroyed by unseen forces.
Live performances.
On 14 May 2018, Kygo and Miguel performed the song live on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon".

Fast Color

Fast Color is a 2018 American superhero drama film directed by Julia Hart from a screenplay by Hart and Jordan Horowitz. Horowitz produced the film along with Mickey Lidell and Pete Shilaimon. It stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Lorraine Toussaint, Saniyya Sidney, Christopher Denham and David Strathairn, and tells the story of Ruth (Mbatha-Raw), a woman with supernatural powers on the run from law enforcement and scientists who want to study and control her.
The project was announced in January 2017, along with Mbatha-Raw's casting and that LD Entertainment would be fully financing the project on their own. Principal photography began on March 13, 2017 in New Mexico and lasted for 28 days.
The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018. It was released on April 19, 2019, by Lionsgate and Codeblack Films. The film received positive reviews from critics with praise directed at Mbatha-Raw's performance and its uniqueness compared to other superhero films, but with criticism aimed at the script.
A television series based on the film is in development at Amazon Studios, with Viola Davis' JuVee Productions producing, and with the film's original writers returning to script the show.
Plot.
In the future American Midwest, where it has not rained for eight years, Ruth (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is a homeless wanderer whose seizures trigger supernatural earthquakes. As she travels to her old family home, she meets Bill (Christopher Denham), a diner customer who is actually a scientist attempting to capture Ruth for study. Bill tricks her into accepting a ride with him then attempts to draw blood samples from her, but Ruth wounds him and flees in the direction of her home. Bill is forced to abandon his vehicle to seek medical aid, where it catches the attention of the local sheriff Ellis (David Strathairn).
Arriving at the home, Ruth reunites with her mother Bo (Lorraine Toussaint), who has the ability to telekinetically disintegrate objects, reassemble them, and see vibrant flashes known as "the colors". Bo has been taking care of Ruth's daughter Lila (Saniyya Sidney), who has the same powers as Bo and has no memories of her mother. After Ruth accidentally sets off another earthquake, Lila is introduced to her and they explain that Ruth's powers deteriorated in her childhood, becoming destructive and causing her to abandon her family.
Lila and Bo attempt to train Ruth on reconnecting with her old powers, while the scientist and the sheriff investigate Ruth's trail. When Ellis discerns Ruth is back home, he covertly signals Bo, his longtime friend and lover, to warn her about the scientist that is searching for their daughter. The next morning, Bill begins heading for the women's house, and Ruth takes off in the family truck to escape him, leaving Bo and Lila behind. When she exits miles later for gasoline, her seizures return. Ruth relives the memory of her nearly drowning her then-infant daughter during a past episode, and then of saving her life, emotionally healing and causing the sky to rain again.
Ruth returns home, where Ellis informs her that Bill and his accomplices kidnapped Lila. Ruth goes to rescue her, followed by Ellis and Bo. At the sheriff's office where Lila is being held, Ruth creates a storm and panics Bill and his guards. Bo offers herself to the scientists in exchange for Lila, who is reunited with her mother. The two escape in the truck, and find a note from Bo telling them to head for Rome to find another woman that she used to know with powers.
Production.
In January 2017, it was announced Gugu Mbatha-Raw had joined the cast of the film, with Julia Hart directing, from a screenplay written by Hart and Jordan Horowitz. Horowitz, Mickey Liddell and Pete Shilaimon will produce under their Original Headquarters and LD Entertainment banners, respectively. In March 2017, Lorraine Toussaint, David Strathairn, Saniyya Sidney, and Christopher Denham joined the cast of the film.
Filming.
Principal photography began in New Mexico on March 13, 2017 and lasted for 28 days.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018. Shortly after, Codeblack Films acquired distribution rights to the film and set it for a March 29, 2019, release. It was then pushed back to April 19, 2019, with Lionsgate now distributing the film from Codeblack Films.
Critical reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 85 reviews, and an average rating of 6.81/10. The website's critic consensus states: "A grounded superhero story with more on its mind than punching bad guys, "Fast Color" leaps over uneven execution with a single Gugu Mbatha-Raw performance". On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 64% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film 3.5 stars and praised Mbatha-Raw for her performance, and director Julia Hart for "genuinely moving drama, an engrossing, supernatural-sci-fi mystery and some pretty darn impressive special effects."
Sheri Linden of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: "Hart has fashioned a tale of matriarchal inheritance, but one whose fierce message is undercut rather than deepened by its child's-book clarity. The intriguing setup receives underpowered execution, the intended jolts landing all too softly."
Amy Nicholson of "Variety" wrote: "Ultimately, Fast Color’s thesis is more inspirational than the film, which often seems like it, too, is struggling to swirl itself into something more solid. Instead, its magical sparks don’t quite congeal as the audience can’t help hoping a movie this empathetic and unusual reaches transcendence".
Television series.
As of 2019, a TV series based on the film was in development at Amazon Studios. The show is set to be produced by Viola Davis and Julius Tennon's company JuVee Productions, with the return of the film's writers Julia Hart and Jordan Horowitz.

Raquel Ormella

Raquel Ormella (born 1969) is an Australian artist focusing on multimedia works such as posters, banners, videography and needlework. Ormella’s work has been showcased in many exhibitions in galleries and museums, including the Shepparton Art Museum and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Working in Sydney and Canberra, Ormella’s pieces are known to encompass themes of activism and social issues in many forms and has received praise.
Early life.
Raquel Ormella was born in Sydney in 1969 to her South American mother and Spanish father. Ormella’s parents immigrated from Germany to Australia. Due to their migration, Ormella identified the negative affect it had on her family and felt a separation from her European life. This rift intrigued her and influenced her decision to spend time in Vienna at the end of her studies.
Ormella first studied Visual Arts at Western Sydney University, Nepean from 1992 to 1996 and then spent a year at the Akademie der Bilden Kunst in Vienna. She also holds of a Masters of Fine Arts from Western Sydney University, Nepean in 2003-5. Ormella was awarded a PhD in Visual Arts by the Australian National University in 2013. Her thesis examined human relationships with urban birds.
Career.
Since 2006 Ormella has taught painting at the Australian National University in the third year, Honours and post-graduate programs along with continuing her personal practice.
Ormella is an artist working at the intersections of art and activism, investigating the means by which critical reflexivity in contemporary art encourages processes of self-examination regarding political consciousness and social action. Ormellaʼs practice is grounded in exploring the nature of the relationship between humans and the natural environment, with a particular focus on urban expansion and forest activism. In highlighting the connectedness between the two, Ormella attempts to show that our depictions of the natural world are not representations of true "wilderness" or a pure state, but rather are informed by human contact and reflective of human values. Ormella has built a practice covering a diverse range of activities such as textiles, video, paintings, installations, drawings, and zines. She is interested in exploring the relation of the audience to the artwork by using multiples. Ormella’s works are displayed in both galleries as well as public spaces. The use of textiles and posters as mediums coincides with Ormella’s focus on activism. The history of embroidery and textile work is embedded in feminist art and was considered ‘women’s work', Ormella uses it as an enforcement of feminist activism in her works.
Ormella’s work focuses more on the story of the world around her rather than herself. She takes into account other individuals' experiences for a theme of commonality within activism. She believes the works should speak for themselves and not be influenced or interpreted via her personal story.
Three of Ormella’s works are held in the Cruthers Collection of Women's Art at the University of Western Australia:

Kalambaka railway station

Kalambaka railway station () is the main railway station in Kalabaka, in the Trikala regional unit, Thessaly. Opened on 16 June 1886 by the Thessaly Railways (now part of OSE). Today TrainOSE operates Regional Express services to destinations across Greece. It is currently the most northwesterly part of the Greek railway network in operation.
History.
The station open 16 June 1886 as a terminus of Thessaly Railways. The original station building (and the line) was designed by the Italian Evaristo de Chirico, (father of Giorgio de Chirico). The line was authorise by the Greek government under the law AMH’/22.6.1882. soon after the liberation of Central Greece from the Ottomans.
After the First World War, the Greek state planned the ambitious construction of several new rail lines and links, including a standard gauge line from Kalambaka on to Kozani and then Veroia creating a conversion of the route from Volos to Kalambaka on standard gauge. In 1927, the relevant decisions were made, starting in 1928, work was carried out on the construction of the new line from Kalambaka. But a year later, it was clear that the project would exceed the estimated costs many times over. In 1932, the construction work was stopped and remains unfinished. In 1955 Thessaly Railways was absorbed into Hellenic State Railways (SEK).
Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down, especially on the mainline section and between Karditsa and Kalampaka. In 2001 the section between Kalampaka and Palaiofarsalos was converted from Narrow gauge (1000 mm) to standard gauge (1435 mm) and physically connected at Palaiofarsalos with the mainline from Athens to Thessaloniki. Since to upgrade, however, travel times improved and the unification of rail gauge allowed direct services, even InterCity services, to link Volos and Kalambaka with Athens and Thessaloniki.
In modern Greek, MP is transliterated as B, not as MB and not as MP. That shows on the station sign, and also on beer labels (MPYRA).
Facilities.
The Station has waiting rooms on platform 1. There is a footbridge from platform 1 to platform 2, via stairs or lift. Luggage storage is no longer available, however the station is staffed, with ticket purchasing facilities.
Services.
Today, the station is served by direct lines to the rest of Greece, via Palaiofarsalos, served both by intercity trains to Athens, Larissa and Thessaloniki and Proastiakos to Athens. Previously Thessaly Railways operated a narrow gauge service to Volos.
In August 2009 TrainOSE S.A. proceeded to a drastic cutback of passenger services on Thessaly lines. As of Spring 2020 There are ten (five in each direction) Regional services on Palaiofarsalos-Kalambaka Line. In addition, there is one Regional train to Athens from Kalambaka and back (884/885).
Future plans.
An extension towards Ioannina and Igoumenitsa has been discussed, but a more northern line from Thessaloniki is currently the preferred trajectory of the so-called Egnatia Railway. However, as of 2020 large investments are unlikely, given the prolonged Greek government-debt crisis.

Craig Cabin

The Craig Cabin was built as a trapper's cabin near Bondurant, Wyoming between 1898 and 1900. Located in the Gros Ventre Range, the log cabin was occupied by Jack Craig from about 1902, who prospected for gold in the area. Despite claims that Craig found gold, there was no evidence that he found any significant amount. Craig advertised his operation on the radio and sold shares in the mine, but was alleged to have planted what gold he had on the site. Geological surveys indicated that what gold could be found had come from higher country via stream drainage. Craig stayed at the cabin during the summer and returned home to Salt Lake City in the winter. Disputes over water made Craig unpopular among local ranchers. From 1940 the cabin was used by Arthur Bowlsby as a lodge for visiting hunters. From 1971 the cabin was used by a succession of outfitting businesses and continues in that use.
The main cabin is a 1-1/2 story log cabin, measuring about by . There are two rooms downstairs with a loft above. A contemporaneous one-story log tack shed is nearby.
The site includes the cabin and mining apparatus used by Craig. A sluice box and water diversion ditches were used in placer mining
The Craig Cabin was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 19, 2016.

Oriental Orthodoxy in North America

Oriental Orthodoxy in North America represents adherents, religious communities, institutions and organizations of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in North America, including the United States, Canada, Mexico and other North American states. Oriental Orthodox Christians in North America are traditionally organized in accordance with their patrimonial ecclesiastical jurisdictions, with each community having its own structure of dioceses and parishes. Most Oriental Orthodox Christians in North America belong to Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Indian, Syriac and some other communities, representing religious majority or minority within a particular community. Oriental Orthodox jurisdictions are organized within the "Standing Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches".
Jurisdictions.
Historically, Oriental Orthodoxy was introduced to North America during the 19th century, mainly through emigration of Christians from the Middle East, Caucasus, North Africa and India. Honoring such diverse heritage, Oriental Orthodoxy in North America is traditionally organized in accordance with patrimonial jurisdictions of autocephalous Oriental Orthodox Churches, each of them having its own hierarchy with dioceses and parishes. Armenian Apostolic Church has two jurisdictions in North America: under the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin there are three dioceses, two in the United States (eastern and western), and one in Canada; while under the Holy See of Cilicia there are also two dioceses in the United States (eastern and western), and one in Canada (see: Armenian (Cilician) Diocese of Canada). Coptic Orthodox Church in North America also has several dioceses. Syriac Orthodox Church in North America has its own hierarchy, with two dioceses in the United States (eastern and western), two patriarchal vicariates (one for Canada and one for Central America), and also adding to that the autonomous Malankara Archdiocese of North America. Also, there are dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in North America, including Malankara Orthodox Diocese of Northeast America (for eastern regions of the United States and eastern regions of Canada), and Malankara Orthodox Diocese of Southwest America (for western regions of the United States and western regions of Canada). Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church also have their jurisdictions in North America.

Carling Hotel (Chicago)

The Carling Hotel is a historic residential hotel located at 1512 N. LaSalle Street in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1927, the hotel was one of many residential hotels constructed to house an influx of labor to Chicago in the early 20th century. While the hotel offered rooms to both temporary and permanent residents, census records indicate that most of its residents were permanent. Architect Edmund J. Meles, who designed several large hotels and apartment buildings in Chicago, designed the building in a blend of the Classical Revival and Renaissance Revival styles. The brick building features extensive terra cotta ornamentation, including entrance and window surrounds, pilasters, and a molded cornice above the first floor.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 24, 2017.

Julie Fragar

Julie Fragar (born 1977) is an Australian painter and educator. She is the recipient of several awards in Australia, including the 2017 Ramsey Art Prize Lipman Karas People's Choice Award, and her work has been acquired by major collections, such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Queensland Art Gallery.
Life.
Fragar was born in Gosford, NSW, in 1977.
Work.
Fragar has been exhibiting her paintings since the 1990s. Her art and research explores the relationships between painterly and personal languages, both biographical and autobiographical. Her paintings are composed as dense agglomerations of fragmented images, “not layers but many images knitted together in one go”. Fragar's earlier paintings drew on her own life and environment as subject matter, combining these with an interest in, and explicit reference to, Gustave Courbet's realism.
Her 2016 painting "Goose Chase: All of Us Together Here and Nowhere", Kilgour Prize 2016 finalist and winner of the 2017 Ramsay Art Prize Lipman Karas People's Choice Award, explores the story of Antonio de Fraga, her first paternal ancestor to emigrate to Australia in the 19th century. Another painting in the same series, "Antonio Departs Flores on the Whaling Tide," won the Tidal: City of Devonport National Art Award 2016"." In 2017 she painted the official portrait of Anna Bligh, Queensland's first female premier.
She also won the ABN Amro Emerging Artists Award (2005) and the Pine Rivers Art Award (2014), and has been included in the Moran Art Prize, the Archibald Prize, and the Gold Art Award.
Her work has been acquired by major collections, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Queensland Art Gallery, and is represented by Sarah Cottier Gallery (Sydney), NKN Gallery (Melbourne), and Bruce Heiser Gallery (Brisbane).

Northeast Siberia Company

The Northeast Siberia Company (NESC) was an American company established in 1902 by a retired Russian colonel named Vonlyarlyarsky, but composed primarily of Chicagoans. The company's chartered purpose was to prospect for gold in the Chukotka region of Russia.
The first problem encountered by the company once it was founded was finding miners willing to work in Chukotka. Because the concession was on imperial land, it could not be divided into claims like in North America. As a result of this, the company could not legally offer any property rights to miners, only salaries. Russian miners were very hard to come by, so the company had to recruit Americans with false promises of lucrative gold stakes with generous terms (half of the gold plus half of the gold-producing land).
The NESC operated vessels of its own, including the gasoline schooner "Barbara Hernster". In 1905, the "Barbara Hernster" struck a reef and was sunk near Providence Bay while on a journey to recover furs and ivory worth more than a million dollars. Its captain, adventurer Olaf Swenson, became a well-known trader in Anadyr.
In 1906 it was reported that the NESC was forbidden by the Russian government from any activities other than mining, such as fur trading. The company may also have been involved in illegally trading alcohol. Also in 1906, American miners working for the NESC reportedly discovered a steel and leather mail coat, along with a helmet and coins which may have been left by Cossack explorers in the mid-1600s.
In 1909, the company sent out a dispatch that there was a prison riot in Yakutsk resulting in the deaths of at least four guards, and that escaped prisoners were attempting to flee to Alaska. Later that year the Russian government banned foreign investment in Chukotka in an effort to stop the "unscrupulous exploitation" and mistreatment of the Chukchi people by the Americans.
The company's concession in Russia was ended in 1910.

Harrisburg incinerator

On December 22, 1969, construction began on a Harrisburg incinerator at a cost of $15 million. The trash-to-steam incinerator was completed in 1972. Over the course of the next three decades, numerous problems arose with the incinerator which would lead the city of Harrisburg to file for bankruptcy in 2011 after debts accumulated of up to $400 million accrued mostly as a result of the incinerator.
Harrisburg's incinerator dioxin.
For the three decades it was running, the incinerator was the "highest emitter of dioxin in the country" according to Jim Topsale, a municipal waste combustion expert for the EPA. Dioxins are very toxic and according to the World Health Organization, they can cause "reproductive and developmental problems, damage the immune system, interfere with hormones and also cause cancer." Eric Epstein, an environmental activist, accused the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of environmental racism because the incinerator was located near two low-income housing projects which had a high minority population.
2000 Dioxin Arctic Study.
In September 2000, a study published by the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation (NACEC), lead by Dr. Barry Commoner, found that Inuit women in the Arctic in Nunavut, Canada were found to have high levels of dioxin in their breast milk. The study tracked the origin of the dioxins using computer models from the sources that produced it and found that the dioxin pollution in the Arctic originated from the United States. Out of 44,000 sources of dioxin polluters in the United States, they found that only 19 were contributing to greater than a third of the dioxin pollution in Nunavut. Out of these 19, Harrisburg's incinerator was the #1 source of dioxin pollution in the Arctic.

Pietro Paolo Parzanese spent almost all his life in his hometown Ariano, where he worked as a priest and a literature and theology teacher in the local seminary. Although he often traveled to Naples, where he had contacts with the literary circles of the capital, and despite having also known of the German romantics, for his poetry, of personal imprint, Parzanese was accused of provincialism by Italian literary critic Francesco de Sanctis ("good and pious poet of the village"). According to Luigi Baldacci, the verses of Parzanese are above all the vehicle of a political ideology.

A young boy sees a rocket kiddie ride at a grocery store. The boy is an aspiring astronaut, and his mother gives him 5 cents, and he rides it. He is disappointed when the ride does not launch him into space. 
Expecting that the ride can do better, he opens a lemonade stand and earns money from it. This goes on until the boy has become an old man. Having earned lots of money to produce more launch attempts, he goes back to the ride and fills it with coins. It wobbles like usual at first, but soon shakes violently and launches him into space. A brief shot from the clouds displays him as a young boy again.

Gordon Kinvig

James Gordon Kinvig (19 June 1888 – 31 July 1917) was a New Zealand cricketer, rugby union footballer and soldier.
Life.
Kinvig was born in Christchurch and educated at Christchurch Boys' High School, where he was a champion sportsman. He moved to Wellington in about 1909 to work in his father's warehousing business. In 1914 he went to Melbourne for business reasons. He returned to Wellington in 1915.
He enlisted in the Wellington Regiment in September 1915 and embarked for Suez in May 1916 as a sergeant. After service in France and officer training in England, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Wellington Second Battalion. He served some time in the trenches. Early in the morning of 31 July 1917 he was killed in the attack on La Basse Ville during the Battle of Pilckem Ridge as part of the Battle of Passchendaele.
Cricket career.
A right-handed lower-order batsman, left-arm medium-pace bowler and fine fieldsman, Kinvig was a successful player at club level but played only two matches for Wellington. In his first match, against the touring Australians in February 1910, he took 3 for 36 in the Australians' first innings. A few weeks before, opening the bowling for his club Central in senior Wellington cricket, he had taken 5 for 2.
Rugby career.
Kinvig played rugby union for Wellington from 1909 to 1913. He was a centre three-quarter with a safe pair of hands, and an accurate left-foot kick in both field play and conversions. He played 26 times for Wellington, scoring eight tries, converting 12 tries, and kicking one penalty goal and one field goal – a total of 53 points.
After his death his family donated a section of land he owned in Karori to the Wellington Rugby Union to be sold and the proceeds used to improve Athletic Park, Wellington.

Llandyfaelog Tre'r-graig

Llandyfaelog Tre'r-graig (Anglicisation: Llandefaelog-tre'r-graig ), which is from Cardiff, is a hamlet in the Felin-fach community of the Brecon, South Powys area of Wales. There are several forms on the name, including Llandefaelog Tre'r Graig (a 'Tre'r-graig' is added to distinguish between it and Llandyfaelog in Carmarthenshire, for the same reason sometimes referred to as Llandyfaelog Fach).
The village is named after St Tyfaelog.
The village is located east of Brecon, on the slopes of the hills between the Brecon Beacons to the west and the Black Mountain to the east. It lies on the rural road between Talgarth to the north and Llanfihangel Tal-y-llyn to the south. Other nearby villages include Loughstone. It is about northeast of Trefeca, associated with the community of the evangelist of the 18th century Howel Harris.

Ken Regan

Ken Regan (June 15, c. 1940s – November 25, 2012) was an American photojournalist from the Bronx, New York City whose reputation for discretion allowed him close connections with subjects including many musicians, politicians and celebrities. He was the official photographer for the Rolling Stones on several tours in the 1970s. He also was the photojournalist on Bob Dylan’s "Rolling Thunder Revue" tour in 1975 and the Live Aid concert in 1985.
Regan was the unofficial personal photographer of Senator Ted Kennedy in the last four decades of Kennedy's life. Regan documented Christopher Reeve’s homecoming from rehabilitation after Reeve's 1995 horse accident which left the actor paralyzed. He photographed local politicians including Meade Esposito.
Regan worked with Palace Press Inside Editions on a book called "Knockout: The Art of Boxing".
He was described by his colleagues as "a big deal". Regan died of cancer in 2012. A spokesperson from his studio declined to release his age, and instead called him "ageless".

Grandi non immerito

Grandi non immerito was a papal bull issued by Pope Innocent IV on 24 July 1245, that effectively removed Sancho II of Portugal from the throne, replacing him with his brother and heir Afonso, Count of Boulogne, in the capacity of regent.
The King's administrative negligence and frequent conflicts with the clergy (which had gotten him excommunicated already by that point), along with his unwillingness to listen to the Roman Curia, led to Pope Innocent IV issuing the bull "Inter alia desiderabilia" in March 1245, which severely crippled Sancho's authority by charging him with the responsibility for the kingdom's near-anarchical state. Following the First Council of Lyon, that same year, Innocent IV issued "Grandi non immerito" urging the people and nobility of Portugal to receive the Count of Boulogne and to pay him "fidelity, homage, allegiance, and accordance", under threat of ecclesiastical censure. The bull did not, however, nominally depose King Sancho or remove any descendants he would beget from the succession (though he would go on to die with no legitimate children).
The Count of Boulogne ruled the kingdom using the styles of "Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino" ("Visitor, Caretaker and Defender of the Realm") until his brother's death and his own eventual acclamation as Afonso III of Portugal.

Unikkatil

Viktor Palokaj (born March 18, 1981), known professionally as Unikkatil (stylized as UniKKatil), is an Albanian rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer who lives in the Bronx, New York City. He was born in Prishtina, Kosovo and his origin is from Kaçinar, Mirditë. He was one of the first Albanian rappers and the leader of TBA (The Bloody Alboz). The message that he sends throughout his songs and the fact that he never made a music video during his career make his style of rap unique. Although he isn’t as active in the music industry recently, he's still considered by many the best Albanian rapper of all time.
Career.
His music career began in 1993 when he recorded his first record. One of the most popular Albanian rappers, his concert in the Pristina stadium was noted to have no less than 25,000 attendees. He was commended by internationally acclaimed Albanian writer Ismail Kadare as an "inspiration to Albanians worldwide".
Unikkatil has released five albums so far. The first album "Shihemi N'përkujtime" was released in 2002, followed by "Fjált e Pavdekshme" in 2004, "Prezenton The Bloody Alboz" in 2005, "Armiqt Suprem" in 2006 and "Kanuni i Katilit" in 2007.

John Ashworth House (200 West, Beaver, Utah)

The John Ashworth House at 115 S. 200 West in Beaver, Utah was built in 1875. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The listing include four contributing buildings.
It was built for John Ashworth, who was born in England and who was the first manager-superintendent of the Beaver Woolen Mills, and who also served as Beaver's second mayor, during 1880–82.
It was deemed "significant because it is an interesting combination of two of the most popular house types in Beaver during the 1875-1890 period, namely, the Hall &amp; Parlor (north section) and the Cross-wing (south section) types. This marriage of house designs produces an interesting effect, for while the house is perfectly consistent with house planning principles found during this period of Beaver's history, it also becomes at once a house which is both common (the Hall &amp; Parlor house with rear extension) and rare (the double cross-wing or H-plan). For a further discussion of the double cross-wing house in Utah, see the nomination form for the Charles E. Davies house, Provo, Utah (National Register listing January 1983)."

Parole (film)

Parole is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language drama film directed by Sharrath Sandith in his feature film debut and written by Ajith Poojappura, based on a true story. It stars Mammootty, Ineya, Miya, Suraj Venjaramoodu, Siddique and Prabhakar. It began principal photography on 14 June 2017 in Bangalore. Loganathan Srinivasan was the cinematographer and Suresh Urs was the editor. Songs and score are composed by Sharreth. The film received mixed response.
"Parole" was released on 6 April 2018 in India.
Plot.
Alex "Mestri" Philippose (Mammootty) is living a happy life with his wife Annie and son Shine, though she is epileptic. One day, he loses his temper and slaps Annie, triggering a fit which causes her to fall into a well. He fails to save her, and his attempts are seen as proof that he killed her. He goes to jail for her murder. 
The first parole application is rejected since his son does not sign it, thinking he will be targeted next. After his sister's death, he finally succeeds in getting parole, with the intention of seeing his son. 
After many attempts, he locates his son, but is distraught when he learns that he is a petty criminal, working for Sudarshan, the local drug kingpin. His son is brought in for questioning, but is taken by Sudarshan. Alex finds Sudarshan, beats him up and rescues his son. The police officer investigating the case threaten to arrest Shine, but decides to arrest Alex instead when he is reminded that his own son, one of Shine's friends, would also be incarcerated. The movie ends with everyone finding out about Alex's innocence as he goes back to jail for another crime he did not commit.
Production.
This is the feature film directorial debut of advertisement film maker Sharrath Sandith, who announced the film in May 2017 with Mammootty whom he had been directing for last 12 years for ad films and Miya George in cast. He said the other cast would be finalised after the filming began, and planned to shoot the film in two schedules to be in Bangalore and Kerala. The screenplay is based on a real life story. The untitled film began principal photography on 14 June 2017 in Bangalore, with 25-days schedule planned there. Mammootty plays a prisoner and Communist comrade, while Juby Ninan, who also co-produced the film, and Lalu Alex appear in jail wardens' roles. In December first, Sharrath revealed Miya's role as Mammootty's sister and stated that filming would be wrapped up in 10 days.
The film was shot in digital CinemaScope and 4K cinematography was employed. The filming took place in around 75 days, of which 25 days were part of prison sequences in Bangalore. Other parts were shot in and around Thodupuzha.
Release.
On 29 March, due to a delay in obtaining the clearance certificate from the Animal Welfare Board of India, which had to be submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification to attain the film's censor certificate, the original release date of 31 March 2018 was pushed to 6 April.
Critical reception.
Sanjith Sidhardhan of "The Times of India" rated the film three in a scale of five and said, "Parole has the elements that would appeal to a family audience – action, drama and sentiments – but a taut script and trimmed first half would have made it an even more engaging venture." "Financial Express" wrote that "Mammootty wins hearts as Sakhavu Alex in this melodrama" and labelled the film as "entertaining". Anna MM Vetticad of "Firstpost" rated 1 out of 5 stars and said, "Parole is not Mammootty’s worst, but if you have seen him at his best, you have to wonder what on earth he is thinking when he picks scripts these days – or whether he is thinking at all.". "Sify" said, "With a script that is melodramatic to the core, the film looks old fashioned and follows a narrative pattern that would have been fine, maybe some decades back".

Saint Tydecho

Saint Tydecho was a 6th century saint of Wales.
The life of Saint Padarn described Tydecho as one of the saints who came to Wales from Armorica. There are questions as to whether this place was Brittany or an area in southeast Wales which is known for its saints. Tydecho was the son of Amwn Ddu (himself son of Emyr Llydaw) and a cousin of Saint Cadfan, with whom he travelled Wales.
He is said to have come to Wales during the time of King Arthur and became an anchorite after the great king's death.&lt;ref name=tourhttps://books.google.com/books?id=fb9kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Saint+Tydecho&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQmtbR5fznAhVSma0KHctbBY84ChDoATAJegQICRAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Saint%20Tydecho&amp;f=false|title=&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tydecho lived with his sister Tegfedd in the Mawddwy area and was the founder of churches at Llanymawddwy, Mallwyd, Garthbeibio and Cemmaes. Tydecho is also credited with founding a chapel, "Capel Tydecho", in Llandegfan. 
Tydecho acquired some of the land for his churches by interesting means. His sister Tegfedd was a beautiful woman who attracted the attention of a wealthy man named Cynon, who kidnapped her as he was so taken by her beauty. Tydecho caught up with the man and forced him to release his sister. He was also able to convince Cynon to compensate for his misdeed by ceding some land to Tydecho for a church at Garthbeibio.
Legends record the young prince of Gwynedd, Maelgwn Gwynedd, as a chief tormentor of the saint. Tydecho, who slept on rocks, wore a hair shirt and engaged in agriculture, used oxen to plough his fields. The prince decided to make off with Tydecho's team. A visit to Tydecho's land the next day found him using a pair of wild stags to plough with a grey wolf pulling the harrow behind them. The angry prince brought dogs to chase off the deer and sat down on a rock to watch the spectacle. When he tried to rise, Gwynedd was unable to do so. His only choice was to make apologies to the saint and beg forgiveness. Among the known concessions were: Tydecho's land was a sanctuary for both men and beasts and exempt from mortuaries, claims and any oppression.
Another legend says that a milkmaid working for Tydecho slipped when crossing the river and her pail of milk spilled into the water. Tydecho's response to the accident was to turn the river from its source to the village of Llanymawddwy into a stream of milk; he called this section Llaethnant. The Welsh poets Dafydd Llwyd ap Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Matthew Brwmffild have both written poems about St. Tydecho: "The Legend of St Tydecho" and "St. Tydecho, and the Two Parishes of Mawddwy".
A feast day is celebrated on 17 December.

Murder of Pamela Mastropietro

Pamela Mastropietro was an 18-year-old Italian woman who was last seen on 29 January 2018. She was murdered soon after in Macerata, Italy. Her murderer, a Nigerian migrant drug dealer named Innocent Oseghale, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison with 18 months of isolation in May 2019; the sentence was confirmed on appeal in October 2020. The murder caused public outrage, anger, and anti-immigrant sentiment in Macerata.
Background.
Mastropietro was born and lived in Rome. She was 18 years old, and had moved away from the recovery community for drug addiction where she was a guest in Corridonia, Marche region, on 29 January. Her mother stated that Mastropietro began abusing drugs after dating a Romanian man, and was living in a drug treatment centre at the time of her death. When she left the community, she did not take her mobile phone and identification documents. She is believed to have sought drugs in Diaz Gardens, a known gathering place for dealers, addicts, and criminals.
Mastropietro's funeral was held on 29 May 2018 at Rome's Ognissanti church, before burial at Campo Verano. Flowers were left by the local Nigerian community and diplomatic staff, Rome mayor Virginia Raggi and also Luca Traini, who shot several African migrants in Macerata days after the murder.
Murder and investigation.
Mastropietro's body was found severely mutilated, hidden in two suitcases; though she was believed to be a murder victim, the exact cause of her death had not been determined as of February 2018. Soon after, Italian police said they found her bloodied clothing at the home of Innocent Oseghale, a Nigerian who moved to Italy in 2014 but who had dropped out of a refugee assistance program and begun selling drugs. Oseghale, described as "a 29-year-old Nigerian with an expired residency permit and a criminal record of drug dealing," was arrested soon after the body and clothing were found. Along with Oseghale, police arrested two other Nigerian men.
An autopsy in March 2018 showed that the cause of death was two abdominal stabbings, and not an overdose as alleged by Oseghale.
On 7 June 2018, the magistrate of Macerata, Giovanni Maria Manzoni, dropped orders of detention on charges of murder, vilification, and destruction and concealment of corpse, against the two men accused alongside Oseghale; these two men remained in prison for heroin charges.
Matteo Salvini, the newly-elected deputy prime minister and interior minister, has often mentioned the Mastropietro murder as part of his hard-on-crime policies and skepticism towards immigration.
Alessandro Meluzzi, a psychiatrist and criminologist, has alleged that the murder was associated with Nigerian organized crime gangs.
A former 'Ndrangheta member named Vincenzo Marino who had shared a cell with Oseghale was called as a key witness against Oseghale's claim that Mastropietro died of a heroin overdose and his only responsibility was the dismemberment. In Marino's testimony, Mastropietro threatened to call the police on Oseghale, who then stabbed her in the liver. He went back to Diaz Gardens to find an unnamed friend to help conceal the body, then began dismembering her. As she unexpectedly still showed signs of life, he stabbed her again. Marino also said that Oseghale mentioned being in the Nigerian mafia.
Between her escape from the rehabilitation clinic and her arrival in Macerata, Mastropietro was given lifts in two local men's cars. Both men were accused of rape for having sex with her while she was not mentally capable of giving consent. The cases were closed by the court in June 2020 as such charges could only have been brought against the men by Mastropietro herself.
In October 2020, Mastropietro's ex-boyfriend, 22-year-old Romanian Claudiu Nitu, was sentenced to three years in prison for attempting to introduce her to prostitution in order to pay for drugs.
Mastropietro's uncle, lawyer Marco Verni, took the knee in her memory during court proceedings during the George Floyd protests in 2020. He said that while he sympathised with Floyd's cause, he disagreed with some murder victims having more public and political support than others. A year earlier he published a photograph of her decapitated head, justifying his decision by pointing to pro-migrant activists who share photographs of drowned migrants.

The film stars Aglaya Tarasova, Alexander Petrov and Miloš Biković.
"Ice" was theatrically released in Russia took place on February 14, 2018 and the Olympic Committee.
A sequel, titled "Ice 2", was released in February 2020.
Plot.
The life of Nadezhda Alexandrovna 'Nadya' Lapshina (Aglaya Tarasova), a humble girl from the city of Irkutsk, Nadya Lapshina always dreamed of being a figure skater, but had problems with coordination and balance, which is why the famous children's coach Irina Sergeyevna Shatalina (Mariya Aronova) refused to take her as a student, contrary to the faith and persuasion of Nadya's mother.
Nadya begins to live with her aunt Margosha, who sells bananas. Margosha treats her niece well and takes care of her as she can, but does not share the late sister’s opinion about Nadya’s potential. However, the girl does not give up and in the end shows such perseverance that Irina Shatalina decides to take her.
Nadya Lapshina begins to live in a boarding school at the local sports palace and learn the basics and subtleties of figure skating. At first, nothing comes out of her, but determination and good learning take their toll and Nadya becomes the best student of the boarding school. As a result, Irina Shatalina nominates her as a candidate for children's figure competitions held throughout the country. Another girl, who was the best before Nadya, tries to sabotage her performance by blunting her skates, but Nadya carries out the impossible and even performs dull-class dance on blunt blades.
Years pass. Nadya Lapshina has matured and became one of the most famous figure skaters in the country. She is invited to go to the big leagues, having tried on the role of a partner of the famous skater Vladimir Borisovich 'Vova' Leonov (Miloš Biković). At first, Nadya refuses, not wanting to leave her beloved coach, but Irina Shatalina, having fallen in love with Nadya as a daughter and wishing her advancement, tells her that her mother deceived her, saying that Irina discerned talent in her as a child. Nadya is upset, but decides to take a chance and eventually gets a place. Soon, he and Vova Leonov begin to live together and he even thinks of proposing to her. However, during the next performance, a catastrophe occurs: Vova accidentally drops Nadya and she hits so hard when she falls that she breaks the spine and becomes disabled. She closes herself from depression and stops communicating with everyone.
In the capital, she fails to recover, and she returns to her aunt and uncle, who is confined to a wheelchair. Irina Shatalina, learning about the troubles of her former student, decides to help her. Meanwhile, in the local hockey team, striker Alexander Arkadyevich 'Sasha' Gorin (Alexander Petrov) has a conflict with a friend, because of which he is suspended from the game. Irina offers him a deal: he will help Nadya restore spirit, and Irina will help him return to the team. Sasha Gorin pretends to agree, but at first he tries to cheat, seeing that Nadya is completely crushed and does not see a chance to recover. However, Irina quickly exposes him, and he begins to act for real.
At first, Sasha and Nadya cannot stand each other, but Sasha Gorin turns out to be a good psychologist and begins to restore Nadya’s spirit by physically mocking her and then finding a common language. Soon this is bearing fruit: the sensitivity of the legs and the ability to move their fingers begin to return to Nadya. After that, they switch to physiotherapy exercises: Sasha starts taking Nadya to the local gym, where she learns to walk again and restores her atrophied leg muscles. As a result, she again gets to her feet, and then returns to the ice. At this point, their relationship with Sasha reached an almost romantic level. As a result, Nadya even persuades him to act as her partner on the return number, speaking in her previous role as a hockey player. The resulting unusual number is received warmly. Later, Sasha also admits to Nadya that in his childhood he also went in for figure skating for some time, to which his grandmother drove him, but his father considered him a purely female sport and persuaded his son to switch to hockey.
After their joint performance, Sasha Gorin unexpectedly meets Vova Leonov in the locker room, who is trying to convince him to leave Nadya, claiming that only he, Vova, can lead her to the Olympic medal. The whole day Sasha spends sad thoughts: he realizes that he has fallen in love with Nadya and wants to be with her, but Vova’s words touched him too deeply. As a result, he gets drunk, comes to Nadya and lies to her that all this time he helped her only out of pity, leaving a big teddy bear won in the shooting gallery.
Nadya Lapshina again unites with Vova Leonova and begins performing in a big competition, but he drops her almost immediately. The doctor establishes that Nadya no longer has any problems with her back: the point is pure psychosomatics. Vova explodes and expresses that in fact he always considered Nadya an insignificant figure skater and spoke with her only because of her popularity among the people. Nadya does not stand it and returns to speak alone, although this is against the rules. Sasha, who watched the contest on television, does not dare to stay away and urgently gets to Moscow. Having entered the stadium with the support of Irina Shatalina, he takes his suit from a dejected Vova and goes out to the ice to Nadya. She in tears asks him why he came, and he confesses to her his feelings. The judges refuse to start playing music for them again, sitting among the audience, begins to sing themselves, and then the whole room picks up the song, and Nadya and Sasha perform a beautiful duet number for it.
Despite the fact that they remained disqualified, Nadya Lapshina and Sasha Gorin are happy, because now they can be together on the ice and outside it.

Everybody Hates Me

"Everybody Hates Me" is a song by American music production duo the Chainsmokers. It was produced by the Chainsmokers and Shaun Frank, with lyrics written by Emily Warren and the song's composer Andrew Taggart. It was released by Disruptor Records and Columbia Records on March 16, 2018, as the third single from the duo's second studio album, "Sick Boy". Its official music video received a nomination for Best Dance at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.
Background.
The duo debuted the song during a live show in Prague on February 11, 2018. They first teased the song on March 13, 2018, along with a shot from the song's music video, which shows the duo standing in front of a car that is on fire. The song was officially announced the next day, accompanied by the cover art.
Composition.
According to CBS Radio's Jon Wiederhorn, "'Everybody Hates Me' is a mid-tempo, hip-hop-inflected track about being dismayed and disillusioned". Lyrically, the song discusses the situation of being self-critical and famous at the same time.
Critical reception.
Patrick Hosken of MTV News opined that the song sees "Drew Taggart ditches singing for a Drake-like recap of his innermost insecurities", writing that his voice "sounds closest to the prototypical emo-inspired whine on songs by the bands he grew up admiring, like Blink-182 and Panic! at the Disco". Jon Wiederhorn of CBS Radio deemed the song "yet another example of the group's catchy, beat-heavy blend of EDM and pop". Lauren O'Neill of Noisey ordered lyrics from the song "by Chainsmokers-Ness", calling it "a very Chainsmokers track". Derrick Rossignol of "Uproxx" regarded the song as "the type of EDM pop track we've come to expect from the Chainsmokers" and "one of the duo's more personal tracks". Andy Cush of "Spin" wrote: "'Everybody Hates Me' has one saving grace: a triumphant EDM drop to rival 'Roses,' delivering exactly the kind of sugar-coated synthy satisfaction they deliberately withheld on the previous whiners 'Sick Boy' and 'You Owe Me.'"

Liudmila Vauchock.
Liudmila Vauchock has gone to the Paralympics before. Almost half the Belarus's medals in cross country skiing were won by Vauchock. When at home, her base for training was Raubichi. She would do three days of intense training, take a day off, and then three more days of intense training. 
Vauchock has a disability because she fell off a dormitory roof. The fall broke her back. Before the accident, she was involved in athletics. Vauchock did like skiing while she was at school. She thought she got more mileage out of running than skiing. Vauchock started skiing after the accident because others encouraged her to try the sport. She says skiing gives her a sense of freedom and speed. It makes her feel independent and allows her to connect with nature. The snow is not a hindrance, but a route to freedom. Volchek does not like attention that competing gives her. She went to Sochi with only her older brother accompanying her. While many people in Belarus were happy with her fifth-place finish in Sochi, she cried as the result was not what she wanted. While there are many challenges and many places in Minsk are not barrier free, she is not sad about the accident that resulted in her needing to use a wheelchair. Without the accident happening, she does not think she would have become an elite sportsperson.

Samathuvapuram

Samathuvapuram () officially Periyar Ninaivu Samathuvapuram (Periyar Memorial Equality Village) is a social equality scheme of the Government of Tamil Nadu to improve social harmony and to reduce caste discrimination. Under the scheme, villages of 100 houses each are being created to accommodate the various castes, with one community hall and burial ground to be shared by all. The scheme is named after the social reformer Periyar E. V. Ramasamy.
Background.
In 1997, the Government of Tamil Nadu decided to change the name of a transport corporation in the Virudhunagar district to the Sundaralingam Transport Corporation, in honour of 18th-century general Veeran Sundaralingam. The name change was the long-time demand of the Dalit Pallar community, which considered Sundaralingam the icon of their community. However, backward caste Thevars opposed the decision since the transport corporation would bear a Dalit name. Thevars torched the transport buses and attacked the drivers. In response, Dalits vandalised U. Muthuramalingam Thevar's statue. Incidents by both castes sparked violence in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu.
Scheme.
The scheme aims to ease the situation and to integrate the Dalits segregated by the caste system to begin using the wells and temples of the dominant communities. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi introduced the housing scheme to create villages of 100 houses each. Each village is subdivided into 40 houses for Dalits, 25 houses for backward caste, 25 houses for most backward caste, and 10 for other communities. To avoid caste discrimination, the Samathuvapuram would have one community hall for all communities, as well as a common burial ground.
The first samathuvapuram inaugurated by M. Karunanidhi on 17 August 1998 in the Melakottai village near Tirumangalam, Madurai. By 2001, 145 samathuvapurams were opened across Tamil Nadu.
Following the change in the state government in 2001, the scheme was abandoned. In 2006, the scheme was revived after M. Karunanidhi came to power. During his tenure, 95 samathuvapurams were opened state-wide.

Czech Republic sent competitors to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The sportspeople are competing two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators. First allocated four sports in para-alpine skiing, the country won two more spots and are sending six skiers. The sledge hockey team goes to South Korea after qualifying at a tournament in Sweden. They had financial difficulties before the Winter Paralympics because of corruption in sports funding. This made it more difficult to train and compete for the 2018 Games.
Team.
In June 2017, the Executive Committee of the Czech Paralympic Committee (ČPV) was told by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) they had been given four spots to send people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics to compete in para-alpine skiing. Three of these spots were for men, and one was for a woman. Patrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang. In September 2017, Pavel Bambousek, Miroslav Lidinský and Anna Pešková seemed to be the most likely skiers to be named to the team in para-alpine skiing. The full team was named by the ČPV on 6 February 2018. It included people in two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators. Anička Pešková was the only woman representing the Czech Republic in Pyeongchang. The team included 6 alpine-skiers and their 2 guides. Tomáš Vaverka, who competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in snowboarding, was selected to compete in para-alpine skiing.
The group was scheduled to fly to South Korea on 3 March 2018.

Qualification.
In June 2017, the Executive Committee of the Czech Paralympic Committee (ČPV) was told by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) they had been given four spots to send people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics to compete in para-alpine skiing. Three of these spots were for men, and one was for a woman. In September 2017, Pavel Bambousek, Miroslav Lidinský and Anna Pešková seemed to be the most likely skiers to be named to the team in para-alpine skiing.
The team had a training camp in early autumn 2017 on the glaciers in the Czech Republic. This was to prepare for their first races, which took place in November in Landgraaf, Netherlands. After that, the team went Pitztal to race.
Support.
Health Care in the Hradec Králové supported Czech para-alpine skiers before Winter Games. This program was supervised by Deputy Governor for Health Care Ing. Aleš Cabicar. Shesaid, "The project of the handicapped skiers center is known, especially their teaching program, which they realize in the Krkonoše Mountains. I am very glad that successful athletes are being prepared in our region to achieve great results. When the representatives of the Center approached me with the request for support and support, I did not hesitate and I am glad that the Hradec Králové Region is one of the partners of the Czech representatives."
Skiers.

Benjamínek Tadeáš Kříž is racing in South Korea with guide skier Radim Nevrlý. Tomáš Vaverka, who competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in snowboarding, was selected to compete in para-alpine skiing.
Schedule and results.
The first event on the para-alpine program is the downhill. It starts on 10 March, running from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. The second event on the program is Super-G. All skiers will race between 9:30 AM and 1:00 PM on 11 March. The super combined takes place on 13 March. The Super-G part of the event is in the morning. The slalom part is in the afternoon.

Para ice hockey.
Roster.
Defensemen Pavel Doležal and Karel Wagner are going to their first games. The other defensemen were all part of the team that went to Sochi. Michal Geier, Zdeněk Hábl, Zdeněk Krupička, Zdeněk Šafránek, David Palat, David Motyčka, Zdeněk Klíma and Martin Novák are the centers and wingers, playing in the attacking positions. The team is coached by Jiří Bříza. He has been leading the team since 2013. Jan Katauer is an assistance coach, and Jakub Novotny is the goaltender coach.
Before the Games.
In the two years before the start of the Winter Games, the sledge hockey team dealt with financial difficulties. Corruption in the Czech Republic involving subsidies for sport resulted in the national team getting less money to support their training and ability to compete in tournaments. FAČR Chairman Miroslav Pelta was arrested as part of the corruption issues. About the corruption, team captain Zdeněk Šafránek said, "The subsidy scandal has radically reduced the amount we receive. For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports." The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling. Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially.
The team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games.
Qualification.
Japan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games. They could go because of how they finished at the Qualification Tournament in October in Ostersund, Sweden in October 2017. Teams participating in the tournament included Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, Japan and Great Britain.
Media coverage.
Some of the Paralympics would be broad on television by ČT TV and ČT Sport. Live streaming of the Winter Games was also made available free on ČT Sport's website.

Denmark at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Denmark sent one competitor to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Team.
The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Denmark") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
Background.
In the autumn of 2017, responsibility for sending a team to the Paralympics was changed from Parasport Denmark, the National Paralympic Committee of Denmark, to the National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark (DIF). The decision was made because people wanted to make Olympic and Paralympic sport more equal. Niels Christiansen, secretary general of Parasport Denmark, said, "We are very happy with the move, and we look forward to working together with DIF. The Paralympics and the development and preparation of world class Para-athletes is still very much a focal point of our work in Parasport Denmark, but allowing DIF to take the reigns [sic] sends an important message and hopefully it will lead to even more Paralympic success for Denmark." Despite this change, Parasport Denmark was still in charge of preparing to send a team to the Winter Paralympic Games.
History.
Denmark first went to the Winter Paralympics in 1980 in Geilo. Before South Korea, they had won a total of two gold medals, one silver medal and three bronze medals at the Winter Games. Both of their gold medals and all of their bronze medals were won by para-Nordic blind skier Anne-Mette Bredahl. Her gold medals were in the biathlon 7.5 kilometres free technique B 1-3 race. The last time the country won a medal was at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. Denmark sends few people to the Winter Paralympics. They sent six people to the 2006 Winter Paralympics, and two to the 2010 and 2014 Games.

Heartland Expressway

The Heartland Expressway (also known as the National Highway System High Priority Corridor 14) is a federally designated High Priority Corridor between Limon, Colorado, and Rapid City, South Dakota in the US. The proposed four-lane corridor is currently under construction, and when completed, will function as the central third of the Ports-to-Plains Alliance, connecting the Ports to Plains Corridor and Theodore Roosevelt Expressway via the Nebraska Panhandle. When completed, the highway will provide multi-lane, divided highway access to cities including Alliance, Nebraska; Scottsbluff, Nebraska; and Brush, Colorado, bringing long-term economic development and reducing travel times in the region.
The proposed $500 million highway is part of a larger project that would create an international trade corridor from Canada to Mexico for the region’s abundant energy and agricultural products, with local community leaders long promoting its completion. Up to $943 million in economic benefits is estimated for the region over a 38-year span as a result of the project, through increased traffic volume, travel time savings, improved connections among trade centers, better labor access, improved access to manufacturing centers, better connections between agricultural centers and markets, better access between raw materials and processors, better access for tourists to local fossil sites, and bring an estimated average of 2.5 million annual savings from accident reduction, 385-950 additional annual jobs and 9.5 million to 24.8 million in annual earnings.
History.
The project started in 1988, as part of the Nebraska Expressway System program. However, parts of the program, including the Heartland Expressway were delayed. The long-delayed highway was estimated in 2012 to cost more than $500 million and take 20 years to complete, according to preliminary estimates for the project, with an estimated time of finalizing the highway in the fall of 2018. The project took its first big step when a new interchange was built linking Interstate 80 (I-80) with about of expressway between Kimball, Nebraska, and Scottsbluff, Nebraska. The highway has been under construction.
Future.
The alignment of the Heartland Expressway will largely follow existing highways, with the project mostly consisting of improvements.

Owe Lüthcke is a sledge hockey referee. The Norwegian went to Pyeongchang to referee matches. He was part of the official Norwegian delegation.
Goals.
For the 2018 Winter Paralympics, Nord-Trøndelag County Council has some goals. These included getting more people to compete in disability sports. They also wanted to increase the level of accessibility to sports buildings and sports field in Nord-Trøndelag County and the rest of Norway.
Doping.
In December 2017, Norway said it would not send any anti-doping officials to the Winter Olympics or Paralympics. They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, "If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are "de facto" relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it."
Cross-country skiing.
Birgit Skarstein competed in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing. She won a gold medal at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in the PR1 W1x. Skarstein also went to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and she finished fourth. Skarstein has also went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics, competing in para-Nordic skiing.

<doc id="56809070" url="?curid=56809070" title="Diuris punctata">
Diuris punctata

Diuris punctata, commonly known as the purple donkey orchid is a species of orchid which is endemic to south-eastern continental Australia. It has two grass-like leaves and up to ten purple or mauve flowers, often with darker, sometimes yellow marks. A yellow form from near Guyra is probably now extinct.
Description.
"Diuris punctata" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to ten flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are purple or mauve, often with darker, sometimes yellow marks. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are greenish-brown, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a dark coloured stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped to fan-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are linear to wedge-shaped, long and wide. There are two ridge-like calli about long, surrounded by yellow in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to December.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris punctata" was first formally described in 1804 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in "Exotic Botany". The specific epithet ("punctata") is a Latin word meaning "spotted".
Distribution and habitat.
The purple donkey orchid is found in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria growing in forest and grassland. In New South Wales it occurs south from the Moonbi Range and in Victoria north from the Mornington Peninsula. A form known as "Diuris punctata" var. "sulfurea" was known from a property near Guyra but is now thought to be extinct. It had smaller, yellow flowers.
Conservation.
"Diuris punctata" is classed as "threatened" in Victoria under the "Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988". The main threats to the species are competition from weeds and grasses, grazing and soil disturbance.

<doc id="56809094" url="?curid=56809094" title="Vaginal stenosis">
Vaginal stenosis

Vaginal stenosis is an abnormal condition in which the vagina becomes narrower and shorter due to the formation of fibrous tissue. Vaginal stenosis can contribute to sexual dysfunction, dyspareunia and make pelvic exams difficult and painful. The lining of the vagina may also be thinner and drier and contain scar tissue. This condition can result in pain during sexual intercourse or a pelvic exam. Vaginal stenosis is often caused by an episiotomy, radiation therapy to the pelvis or some types of surgery. Chemotherapy can also increase the likelihood of developing vaginal stenosis. Vaginal stenosis can be a defect caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Having an episiotomy is associated with stenosis.
Causes.
Radiation-induced.
Uterine, vaginal, rectal and cervical cancers are often treated with pelvic radiation therapy (RT). Radiation-induced vaginal stenosis can be a side effect of treatment. Causes are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy. It is one of the most prevalent side effects of pelvic radiation, affecting about one third of women. Radiation-induced stenosis can be a late reaction to treatment. Damage to the vaginal epithelium causes abnormal collagen production that leads to atrophy, loss of muscle, decreased blood flow, hypoxia, and fibrosis. Pallor, adhesions, and fragility can be observed along with loss of elasticity.
Congenital.
The inadequate prenatal suppression of adrenal androgens leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This condition can result in the vagina being affected by stenosis as a result.
Treatment.
Stenosis of the vagina is treated with vaginal dilator therapy, but the evidence is lacking for its efficacy.

Question paper leaks in Bangladesh

According to the Government of Bangladesh, the first question paper leak from any public examination happened in 1979, during the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination period. However, leaks have become more frequent since 2014. Question papers of other public examinations such as the Primary School Certificate (PSC), Junior School Certificate (JSC), Secondary School Certificate and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) have been leaked in a regular basis. There have also been multiple university and medical entrance exam question paper leaks.
Incidents.
Certificate examinations.
In 2014, question papers from all Bangladesh public examinations were leaked but the government initially denied this allegation. However, after a few days, Minister of Education of Bangladesh Nurul Islam Nahid declared quick action would be taken against people involved in question paper leaks.
During the 2014 HSC examination period, the English exam schedule of Dhaka Board was changed due to leaks. Other tests' question papers were leaked but no further action was taken.
Admission tests.
There were allegations of Medical and Dental entrance test question paper leaks in 2015. The Health Minister Mohammad Nasim denied this allegation. An inquiry team was established which confirmed the allegations and suggested the entrance test be retaken. Students and renowned Bangladesh educators like Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Syed Abul Maksud protested against the leak and demanded the test be retaken, but no action was taken. The demonstration was described as 'illogical' and the Health Minister Mohammad Nasim described the demonstrations as hype.
In 2018, the question paper of Dhaka University D unit (Gha Unit) entrance test was allegedly leaked. The government denied this allegation.
In 2020, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of police said that at least 4,000 students were admitted to several medical and dental colleges through answering the question papers leaked by a gang from 2013 to 2018.
Criticism and reaction.
Bangladesh people and educators have criticized the leaks. In 2014, scientist and writer Muhammad Zafar Iqbal protested at the Central Shaheed Minar against an alleged leak and the government's silence.
In 2015, there was a massive student demonstration against Medical and Dental Entrance Test leaks. Educator and columnist Syed Abul Maksud joined this demonstration and demanded the test be retaken.
The Bangladesh Government had several meetings with Bangladesh educators to prevent question paper leaks. The government banned internet access and social media several times; however, none of these interventions were successful.
Law and punishment.
Leaking and distribution of any public examination question paper is a crime under Bangladesh law. According to 'The Public Examinations (Offences) (Amended) Act, 1992' the punishment is a 3-10 year prison term. Many people have been arrested in relation to question paper leaks. On 2017, a government official was arrested for being involved with a Medical and Dental Entrance Test question paper leak. However, no-one has been punished over this incident.

<doc id="56809315" url="?curid=56809315" title="Combined hormonal contraception">
Combined hormonal contraception

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC), or combined birth control, is a form of hormonal contraception which combines both an estrogen and a progestogen in varying formulations.
The different types available include the pill, the patch and the vaginal ring, which are all widely available, and an injection, which is available in only some countries. They work by mainly suppressing luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn preventing ovulation.
The pill, patch, and vaginal ring are all about 93% effective with typical use. Beneficial health effects include reduced risks of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancers. CHC can also provide improved control of some menstrual problems. Adverse effects include a small but higher risk of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, breast cancer and cervical cancer.
Medical use.
Contraceptive use.
With perfect use, less than 1% of women will become pregnant during the first year of using CHC. However, with typical use 9% of women will become pregnant during the first year. Traditionally, to mimic a normal menstrual cycle, CHC is used for 21 consecutive days. For all of these methods (pill, patch, vaginal ring), these 21 days are typically followed by either 7 days of no use (for the pill, patch or vaginal ring) or 7 days of administration of placebo pills (for the pill only). During these 7 days, withdrawal bleeding occurs. For those women who do not desire withdrawal bleeding or require bleeding to be suppressed completely, medication regimens can be tailored to the individual with extended periods of use and infrequent hormone-free periods. The efficacy of CHC is the same whether these methods are used continuously or with a 7 day break to allow for withdrawal bleeding.
Non-contraceptive use.
COCs can be used to treat menstrual cycle disorders including heavy menstrual bleeding, and pelvic pain disorders such as endometriosis and dysmenorrhea. CHCs are also a first line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome for menstrual abnormalities, acne, and hirsutism.
Perimenopausal women on combined oral contraceptives have increased bone density, and COCs can be used to decrease hot flashes. Combined oral contraceptives have been shown to reduce risk of endometrial cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 ovarian cancer, and a modest reduction in colon cancer.
Mechanism of action.
Prevention of ovulation occurs via inhibition of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, through progesterone and estrogen providing negative feedback to the hypothalamus and inhibiting the production of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH typically promotes the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. The presence of estrogen in CHCs results in downstream inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) which typically act at the ovarian level to induce ovulation and promote development of the follicle respectively. Progesterone also contributes to the contraceptive effect by making changes to the cervical mucus, endometrium and tubal motility.
Treatment considerations.
Adverse effects.
Although the risk of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, breast cancer and cervical cancer in CHC users is small, all CHCs are associated with higher risks of these compared to no use. Given that the vast majority of the studies evaluating these associations have been observational studies, causation between CHC use and these conditions is unable to be determined. All CHCs are associated with an increased incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism. However, those containing higher doses of estrogen are associated with an increase in venous and arterial thromboembolism. In addition, some formulations of progesterone, including gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone, in combination with estrogen, have been associated with higher rates of venous thromboembolism compared to formulations containing a type of progesterone called levonorgestrel.
Other adverse effects include nausea, headaches, breast pain, skin pigmentation, irregular menstrual bleeding, absent periods and irritation from contact lenses. Changes in libido and mood, decline of liver function and raised blood pressure may also occur.
Contraindications.
The estrogen in combined hormonal contraception can increase the risk of clotting in some women. In particular, this can manifest as a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, the risk with low-dose combined hormonal contraceptives remain relatively low in most cases. Health providers may recommend against formulations with estrogen in women with certain risk factors including personal or family history of blood clots, pregnancy and the first 3 weeks postpartum, obesity, inactivity, and coagulation disorders. Additionally, combined hormonal contraceptives are sometimes not recommended in the first 4–6 weeks postpartum after delivery due to concerns of effect on breastfeeding performance.
Estrogens and progestins are metabolized in the liver, so there is a theoretical concern for use in women with liver disease.
Large studies have shown a slight increased incidence of breast cancer among hormonal contraceptive users compared to nonusers. However, the overall risk of breast cancer in users and nonusers remains low. Research has also shown a link between cervical cancer and long-term use of combined hormonal contraception, particularly in women with chronic HPV infection of the cervix. Combined hormonal contraceptives are also associated with a decreased risk of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.
Side effects.
The most common side-effects of combined hormonal contraceptives include headache, nausea, breast tenderness, and breakthrough bleeding.  Vaginal ring use can include additional side-effects including vaginal irritation and vaginal discharge. Contraceptive skin patch use can also include a side-effect of skin irritation around the patch site. Breakthrough bleeding within the first 3–6 months is generally not harmful and often resolves with persistent use.
Contradictory research exists on the effects of combined hormonal contraceptives on weight gain. Clinical studies have shown some women report weight gain while others report weight loss. Several mechanisms for weight gain have been theorized including increased fluid retention, increase in muscle tissue, and increase in body fat. Many women stop taking combined hormonal contraceptives because they are concerned about weight gain; however, the link remains uncertain.
The effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on mood is unclear at this point. There have been some large cohort studies suggesting there may be an association with mood-related side-effects. Patient-perceived changes in mood remain one of the most common reasons for hormonal contraceptive discontinuation.
Drug interactions.
Liver enzyme inducing drugs.
Medications that induce liver enzymes increase the metabolism of oestradiol and progestogens and subsequently may reduce the effectiveness of CHC. The advice on CHC also depends on whether the liver inducing drug is used short term, for less than two months, or long term, for more than two months.
Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne).
Should a woman have taken ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) for emergency contraception, restarting CHC may reduce ellaOne's effectiveness, hence advice is to wait five days before commencing CHC.
Antibiotics.
Extra contraceptive precautions are not necessary when using CHC in combination with antibiotics that do not induce liver enzymes, unless the antibiotics cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea.
Antiepileptics.
Medications used in the treatment of epilepsy can interact with the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring, resulting in both pregnancy and shift in seizure threshold.
Lamotrigine.
Based on a study of 16 women using oral CHC 30 μg ethinyloestradiol/150 μg levonorgestrel and anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine for 6 weeks, it was revealed that the contraceptive effectiveness could be lowered, despite lamotrigine not being an enzyme inducer.
An assessment of risks versus benefits of CHC is recommended in women on lamotrigine who are considering CHC, as the seizure threshold in someone on lamotrigine may be lowered by the oestrogen in CHC. In a similar mechanism, stopping CHC in a patient on lamotrigine can cause lamotrigine toxicity. Long-acting reversible contraception instead may be preferable.
Special populations.
Following childbirth, the use of CHC depends on factors such as whether the mother is breastfeeding and whether she has other medical conditions including superficial venous thrombosis and dyslipidaemia.
Age.
When considering CHC use by age only, use is unrestricted between menarche and age 40, and can be generally used after age 40.
Breastfeeding.
CHC should not be used by breastfeeding women in the first six weeks after delivery and are generally not recommended in the first six months after delivery if still breastfeeding. After six months, breastfeeding women may use CHC.
Epidemiology.
Between 2015 and 2017, 64.9% of women ages 15–49 in the United states were using contraception, and of those 12.6% were using the oral contraceptive pill. There are approximately 100 million users of combined oral contraceptives worldwide, with use being more common in Western Europe, Northern Europe, and the United States. In the UK, one survey demonstrated that in 2010–2012, more than 33% of women aged 16–44 years had used oral contraception in the previous year and that it was mostly the combined type. Between 2006 and 2010 only 10% of women in the US had used the contraceptive patch, and 6% had used the vaginal ring. Combined injectables are most common in China, South-East Asia and South America.
History.
CHC has been used worldwide for more than 60 years, with the first clinical trials on oral CHC beginning in 1956.
The FDA first approved the oral contraceptive in 1960. The first oral contraceptive contained 100 to 175 µg of estrogen and 10 mg of progesterone. However, at these levels significant adverse effects were seen and modern preparations contain lower levels of 30 to 50 µg of estrogen and 0.3 to 1 mg of progesterone.
The first contraception vaginal ring was approved for use in the United states in 2001. Development of the ring has led to several designs with different sizes, ring materials, and steroid formulations. Modern designs are made of plastic polymer rings containing sex steroids which diffuse out of the ring directly into the vaginal epithelium and into systemic circulation.
The first birth control patch, “Ortho Evra”  was first introduced in 2002. In 2014, a generic version of Ortho Evra was released and called “Xulane”. In 2020, the FDA approved Twirla, a low-dose transdermal combined hormonal contraceptive.

Romania at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Romania sent a competitor to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Romania's sole competitor was Mihaita Papară, in para-snowboarding. Romania first went to the Winter Paralympics in 2010. The country has never won a medal at the Winter Games. At the 2010 and 2014 Games, Romania was represented by one skier, Laura Văleanu.
Team.
Romania sent only one person to the 2018 Games. The person was Mihaita Papara. He competes in para-snowboarding 
The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Romania") that participated in the 2018 Games.
Assistance.
The Romanian National Paralympic Committee has few employees andvery little money. Despite this, they try to help all sportspeople with disabilities in Romania. Their 2014 budget was for twelve sports. Snowboarding became their thirteenth sport. This happened after Mihaita Papara asked the Committee Chairperson Sally Wood Lamont to support him. In 2016, the budget for the Romanian National Paralympic Committee increased. The year of the Summer Paralympics, their budget was . In comparison, Croatia had a budget of in 2015. The money increased because Romanians did well in international competitions. Because the costs to compete are very high, the money was still not enough. There are few sponsors for disabled sportspeople in Romania. The Paralympic Games do not get much media coverage. This makes it very difficult for people in Romania to go to the Games.
Para-snowboarding.
Snowboarders.
Papară started snowboarding after a car accident. Snowboarding made his life more normal. It was more like life before his accident. He started using a new knee prosthesis in 2012. It was exhausting. He could have tried to go to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. He chose not to. Because he would not have been at his best, Papară thought it was not honorable to go. He also did not have much experience competing at snowboarding. By 2018, things had changed. Papară had participated in a lot more races. He had more experience. His fitness was better. He entered his first international snowboard race in November 2014. Before his first race, a little voice in his head said, "Wait, what you're doing, it's too risky, you're going to hurt yourself, give up!" The prosthetic he uses to snowboard costs . The Romania Olympic Committee assisted in paying for part of his prosthetic.
Laura Văleanu is Papară's role model. Her amputation is similar to his. She was a skier. She represented Romania at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Those were the first Winter Paralympics Romania went to. Sport was a passion for her. It assisted in her recovery. Papară tried to do the same as Văleanu. Sport became a way to regain life.
Papară was in a car accident in 3 September 2005. Because of the accident, doctors amputated his leg. After the accident, he tried to live a normal life. He tried to make sure his amputation did not mean he could not do things he wanted to do. He said, "The recovery after such an accident, after an amputation is very difficult and lasting. If I were to give advice to a person in the same situation, I would tell them to start a physical activity, to start sport as soon as possible."
Papară is from Gheorgheni, Harghita. He was born in Harghita.
Before the Games.
In early February, Papară went to a World Cup in Canada. He was in the banked slalom and snowboard cross races. He said it was important people in Romania saw him snowboarding. He thinks it will help change people's mind about what people with disabilities can do. He wants to be a role model for others with disabilities.
Schedule and results.
The snowboard cross event starts on 12 March. It starts at 10:30 AM and goes to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women. The slalom race is scheduled to take place on 16 March. It goes from 10:30 AM - 4:55 PM. Men and women in all classes are racing at that time.

Russian doping scandal.
15 National Paralympic Committees and the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation signed a letter expressing support for the National Paralympic Committee of Russia in August 2017. The countries included Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Laos, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Montenegro, and South Korea. They asked the IPC Governing Board to consider letting Russia compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. The letter was signed weeks before the IPC Governing Board met in Abu Dhabi. In September 2017, this decision was reviewed and upheld. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) still had concerns about doping in Russian sport. All the conditions the IPC required of the Russians were not met.

He is a 16-year-old who had an injury a few months before the Winter Games started. He is coached by Roman Podlipnik.

Team.
The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Slovenia") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
Para-alpine skiing.
Skiers.
16-year-old Jernej Slivnik had a shoulder injury five months before the 2018 Games. He started practicing again at a ski resort in Slovenia in December 2017. His goal was to be prepared for the 2018 World Cup in Kranjska Gora. The competition was one of seven World Cup races before the season before the Games. He was coached by Roman Podlipnik. He also trained with Slovene deaf skier Anja Drev. His coach was happy in late December. Slivnik was recovering faster than expected from his shoulder injury. At the end of December 2017, he was the only Slovene to have earned the right to compete at the Paralympics. Because his recovery went so fast, he competed at a World Cup in Zagreb, Croatia in early December. This was in addition to the World Cup a week later in Slovenia. After his first run in Zagreb, he was in thirteenth position. He did not finish his second run. His coach was still happy with his performance. At the World Cup in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, he finished his races. The World Cup was only a few days after the World Cup in Zagreb. While he finished thirteenth, his finishing the World Cup race was very important. It meant he completed all the things required of him to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. After the race, his coach said, ""I congratulate Jernejo, because I know he has not been able to do it in the last few weeks. He was injured, but he did not finish the race in Zagreb, even though he was skiing well. Depending on the layout and the conditions on the track it worked well. I expect that now the preparations for the Paralympic Games will be relaxed and fully dedicated." Slivnik said after qualifying for the Paralympics, "Before the first run there were some problems with the track, but the Kranjska Gora team did a great job and prepared a track that was excellent. In the second, the track was already slightly slapped. I made a little mistake, but I did not want to give in, I wanted to aim. I did it. I am glad that I have confirmed my departure for the Paralympic Games, as this idea of successfully passing the game was a long time in the head."

Spain at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Spain sent competitors to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The team from Spain had 4 people. They included 2 snowboarders and 2 skiers. Blind skier Jon Santacana and guide skier Miguel Galindo Garces competed at the Paralympics before in 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014. Astrid Fina Paredes went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Snowboarder Víctor González will be going to his first Paralympic Games.
Team.
Spain sent 4 people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics. They were snowboards and alpine skiers. The team went to an event in Madrid on 26 February 2018 in Madrid. After the event, they went to South Korea.
The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Spain") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
History.
Traditionally, the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden have been the best countries at the Winter Paralympics. Spain has not sent many people, and has not won many medals. One of the reasons is that there are not many places to ski, and it is very expensive. This discourages people from trying winter sports. Paralympic sports are also treated the same as women's sports in Spain. They are hidden away, and the media gives little coverage to the sporting accomplishments of its elite Paralympic sportspeople. While Olympic people have guaranteed money because of Plan ADO, Paralympic people get much less money from Plan ADOP. The money they get is also much less secure, changing from year to year. This makes it difficult for Spanish Paralympic people to plan in advance their practice and competition calendar. Olympic people get money for the year. Paralympic people only get money for a month. The next month, they may not get any money from Plan ADOP. While Spain has a lot of people with disabilities, only 0.5% have a sports license.
There were some issues related to clothing making Joma sponsoring the Winter Paralympic team. The company already sponsored the 2018 Spanish Winter Olympic team. This started during preparations for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Joma wanted to provide clothing for only some members of the Spanish team going to Rio de Janeiro. They did not want to provide clothes for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Summer Paralympics. The company cited a lack of commercial visibility for the Paralympic Games as the reason they wanted to do this. While Joma was not providing clothing for all team members for all parts of the Summer Paralympics, the company created advertising saying they were official sponsors of the team. The Spanish Paralympic Committee did not consider them to be sponsors as they were not providing everyone with clothing. They asked Joma to stop what they thought was deceptive advertising. The Spanish Paralympic Committee also considered taking legal action against Joma. The Summer Paralympics became the first Paralympic Games in 20 years where the Spanish Olympic and Paralympic teams did not have the same clothing sponsor. This situation continued with the 2018 Winter Paralympics.
Para-alpine skiing.
Skiers.
Jon Santacana competed at the 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014 Winter Paralympics with his guide, Miguel Galindo Garces. He won eight medals between 2002 and 2014 at the Paralympics. Three were gold. Three were silver. Two were bronze.

Para-snowboarding.
Snowboarders.
Spain sent two snowboarders to the Paralympic Games in South Korea. They were Astrid Fina Paredes and Víctor González. They are members of Federación Española de Deportes de Personas con Discapacidad Física, a sport organization for people with physical disabilities.
Astrid Fina Paredes.
Astrid Fina Paredes went to the IPC World Cup 2017 in La Molina, Spain. She won two silver medals. The World Cup was part of her training for the 2018 Winter Paralympics. In February 2017, she went to the IPC Para-Snowboarding World Championships in Big White, Canada. She finished fourth in the snowboard slalom race and fifth in the snowboard cross race. In 2017, she wanted to go to the 2018 Paralympic Games and win a medal. Her fear was she would get hurt. This would make it difficult to race and get a medal. She leaves for South Korea on 2 March 2018, with her first race on 12 March and her second one 15 March.
Astrid Fina Paredes was at the 2014 Winter Paralympics, with the 2018 Games being her second Games. At Sochi 2014, she finished sixth in snowboard cross. From Barcelona, Fina Paredes has a physical disability because of a traffic accident in 2009. In 2013, her leg was amputated. She started para-snowboarding that year. It was one year from when she start that she went to Sochi. Participating in snowboarding costs a lot of money. To continue to practice and compete in the southern hemisphere during 2016, she needed to rent out her apartment in Spain. Team Spain had no money to help her.
Víctor González.
Víctor González was a snowboarder. He had an accident. Because of the accident, he got a disability in his legs. After the accident, he switched to para-snowboarding.
Schedule and results.
The snowboard cross event starts on 12 March, running from 10:30 AM to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women. The slalom race is scheduled to take place on 16 March, going from 10:30 AM - 4:55 PM for men and women in all classes.
Medalists.
The Government of Spain said there was 135,000 € total to give to Spanish sportspeople who won medals at the 2018 Games. If a person won a gold medal, they got up to 30,000 €. If a person won a silver medal, they got up to 15,000 €. A person with a bronze medal got up to 9,000 €. These totals have been criticized. At the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the government allocated 1,861,000 € for Olympic medalists but only 684,000 € to people who won medals at the Paralympics. The individual totals are still better than the past. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Olympic gold won a person 94,000 € but a gold medal at the Paralympics only won a person 10,000 €.

Saint Clydwyn

Clydwyn is a 6th-century Pre-Congregational Saint of Wales.
The eldest son of Brychan Brycheiniog and brother of St Tudful, he was himself king.
His children included Clydog, Cynon and St Cynlefr the Martyr and St Berwen.
Although some sources say he conquered the whole of South Wales, this is unlikely, but it is possible that he was at one time also king of Ceredigion and Dyfed along with his brother Dedyw.
He is commemorated by the now ruined church of St Enclydwyn, in Penmachno.
A feast day celebrates his life on 1 November.

Turkey at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Turkey sent a competitor to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Their sole competitor was alpine skier Mehmet Çekiç. Turkey made an effort to qualify in other sports, including wheelchair curling, but proved unable to win spots in the Games for those. Turkey is a recent competitor as nations go, making its first Winter Paralympics appearance at the 2014 Games.
Team.
In December 2017, the National Paralympic Committee of Turkey announced that one person would go to Pyeongchang. Alpine skier Mehmet Çekiç was the person selected. The National Paralympic Committee provided Çekiç with all the resources he needed. This was done with assistance from Turkey's national ski federation. The country wanted to send more people to South Korea for the Games. People had problems with qualifications for the Games. The President of the National Paralympic Committee of Turkey said they wanted to send more people to the 2022 Winter Paralympics. They would work hard to make that happen. Financial problems and being responsibility for 18 sports made securing more positions for Pyeongchang difficult.
The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Turkey") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
Turkey tried to go to the 2018 Winter Paralympics in wheelchair curling. Turkey Physically Disabled Sports Federation Wheelchair Curling was created a year before the ability to get the right to go by winning the Wheelchair Curling World Championships B Tournament.

20 Stycznia 1920 Street in Bydgoszcz

20 Stycznia 1920 Street is located in downtown district, in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Many of the buildings along this axis are either registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, or part of a historical ensemble of Eclectic and Art Nouveau architecture in the city.
Location.
Located in downtown district, the street unfolds on an approximate south–north axis, parallel to Gdańska street on the west and Staszica and Paderewskiego Streets on the east. The southern tip of the street (odd numbers till 9) faces the agreeable Jan Kochanowski Park.
History.
On an 1876 map by Paul Berthold Jaekel, as well as on an 1880 map, the axis is drawn, without any mention of the name.
The first map to reference the street dates back to 1908, where it is named "Goethestraße".
In Bromberg's address books, the lane is mentioned in 1905 as being under construction. The following year only three edifices are listed in "Goethestraße" : 
Naming.
The pathway was known as "Goethestraße", from its construction to 1920 and during German occupation (1939-1945).
The name referred to the famous German writer and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).
The current name "20 Stycznia 1920 Street ", was adopted on September 13, 1921, by the city council to celebrate the date of the signature of the "Act on citizenship of the Polish State", which came in force on January 31, 1920 and underlined the re-creation of the Polish sovereign nation.
The communist period modified in 1948, the name of the street to "24 January 1945", commemorating the "liberation" of Bydgoszcz from German forces.
Calling came back to the actual one on June 26, 1989.
Main edifices.
Bydgoszcz Music Academy building, at Słowackiego Street N°7, corner with 20 Stycznia 1920 Street
Registered on "Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list", N°601404-Reg.A/782/1-3 (May 8, 1992)
1904-1906
Neo-Baroque
The building has been initially erected to house the administrative services of the district authorities () at the beginning of the 20th century. It now accommodates the seat of the Bydgoszcz Music Academy - "Feliks Nowowiejski".
The edifice presents an eclectic architecture, with a predominance of Neo-Baroque forms.
Tenement at No.2, corner with Adam Mickiewicz Alley
1903, by Rudolf Kern
Art Nouveau
In the 1906's address book, the edifice is identified as "new building" (), belonging to Julius Berger, a merchant and located at then "Goethestraße 37". During the occupation, an annex of the NSDAP was housed there.
This corner house displays Art Nouveau features, especially in the ornamental details of the three avant-corps sections, the lean pilasters and the ogee-shape wall dormers, as well as the well adorned portal.
Oskar Unverferth House at No.3
1907, by Fritz Weidner
Eclecticism
Although registered as a 1905 construction, the building is only listed in 1908. It was a commission from Oskar Unverferth, who ran a furniture factory. The designer was Fritz Weidner, a famous city architect in Bydgoszcz. Oskar Unverferth moved there in 1908 and remained landlord till 1922.
The villa is characteristic of the Landhaus style that Fritz Weidner more than often applied to his realizations in Bydgoszcz. A myriad of architectural details on the asymmetrical facades (bow windows, balconies, arches, Art Nouveau motifs), make the villa resemble a country house. The house was entirely refurbished in 2012.
House Meyer at No.5
1906
Art Nouveau
On the plot at then "Goethestraße No.4", Carl Meyer, Bromberg building councilor and designer, had built his own house in the early 20th century.

He lived there until he left Bydgoszcz in 1919.
Reflecting its neighbour at No.3, the villa boasts Art Nouveau references, especially in the embellished portal of the front door, topped by an oval transom light.
House at No.6
1911, by Emil Heydemann
Eclecticism
Hermann Draheim, a rentier, was the first landlord of this tenement in the 1910s, located at then "Goethestraße 35". Witold
Bełza, librarian, writer, publicist, cultural activist and director of the City Library lived there from 1920 to 1939.
The facade reminds similar tenements built in Dworcowa Street 45/47 in 1905/1906. Yet, here, architectural details lean on more simplicity in the making and the shape, with less Art Nouveau motifs.
Alfred Schleusener House at No.7
ca 1909
Eclecticism
Built in 1909, as mentioned on the top of the elevation, Alfred Schleusener is the first registered owner in the 1910s. Schleusener was an active designer and builder in Bromberg/Bydgoszcz in the first half of the 20th century.
The villa reflects architectural tendencies on the fringe between Art Nouveau and early modernism.
Dr Graeupner's House at No.8
1906-1907, Emil and Georg Zillmann
Art Nouveau
This edifice has been commissioned by Dr Max Graeupner to Emil and Georg Zillmann, architects from Charlottenburg. It had been accommodating Max Graeupner's clinic, specialized in Women's diseases and obstetrics (). He lived at "Dantsiger straße 38", today's Gdańska Street 63. After First World War, the building was still used as a medical facility, run by Dr Gliński.
Many elements can be highlighted: a series of floral motifs in the pediments and in cartouches, or the balconies wrought iron 
fences, as well as the characteristic Art Nouveau waved lines in the decoration of the street door.
Tenement at No.9
1936-1938
Modern architecture, by Jan Kossowski
Like many other buildings in downtown Bydgoszcz (7 Plac Wolności, 14 Kopernika Street, 11 Ossoliński Alley), this edifice is an additional and accurate instance of Polish modernism of the interwar period.
Tenement at No.10/12
ca 1906, by Paul Böhm
Early Modern architecture
On the 1908 Bromberg's address book, Paul Böhm was listed as the first owner of this vast building. Paul Böhm was a prolific architect and designer in Bromberg, between the 1880s and the 1910s.
Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz, at Adam Mickiewicz Alley 2, corner with 20 Sycznia 1920 street
1948-1949, by Alfons Licznerski
Modern architecture
Hieronim Konieczka Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz is the largest and best known theatre of the city. Its current director is Paweł Wodziński.
Petrikowski Tenement at No.14, corner with Zamoyskiego street
1906-1907, by Victor Petrikowski
Art Nouveau
This tenement from 1906 had as first landlord Victor Petrikowski, a carpenter and a construction entrepreneur who designed the current building. In this house lived Edward Woyniłłowicz, a Polish and Belarusian social and economic activist, who left his eastern lands to dwell in Bydgoszcz. He wrote there his memoirs, "Wspomnienia 1847-1928".
The edifice has been thoroughly renovated in 2015, preserving its historic Art Nouveau architectural details, alongside its specific decorated interiors (staircase, ornaments and stained glass).
Rudolf Kern tenement at No.16, corner with Zamoyskiego street
Registered on "Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list", N°A/1628/1-2 (February 25,)
1910, by Rudolf Kern

Tenement at No.18
1911, by Rudolf Kern
Art Nouveau, elements of early modernism
The edifice at then "Goethestraße 29" has been commissioned by a master mason, Mr Weiss. In the 1930s, young Zbigniew Raszewski (1925-1992), a future Polish writer and theatre historian, lived there with his family.
The elevation, renovated in 2017, reveals much of a transition of architectural styles common at this period of the 1910s, between early modernism and late Art Nouveau.
Tenement at No.19
1910, by Fritz Weidner
Art Nouveau, elements of early modernism
The initial owner, Richard Schramke, was a decorator. He tasked Fritz Weidner, a trendy Bromberg architect at that time, to realize a large building for renting purposes.
The unbalanced facade, peculiar to Art Nouveau style, is studded with balconies, avant-corps and loggias, but the absence of other detailed motifs challenges the uniformity of the ensemble.
Tenement at No.20
1911, by Alfred Mielke
The building commissioner was Max Reschke, a master carpenter who never lived there, but at neighbouring No.22.
The frontage, refurbished in 2017, displays the carved door crowned with a curved fan light and several cartouches, rosettes and other motifs in the Art Nouveau fashion.
Tenement at No.21
1912, by Georg Baesler
Art Nouveau
Commissioned by Józef Grabowski, a painter, to Georg Baesler; Grabowski never inhabited there. It was once the property of Erwin Wodke, co-owner of a transport company "F.Wodtke - International Furniture Transport" which stables and warehouses were located in the backyard accessible through the gateway.
Although damaged by time, the facade still exhibits wrought iron balconies and railings.
Tenement at No.22
1911, by Alfred Mielke
Art Nouveau
Realized after an order from Max Reschke, a master carpenter, also owner of No.20. His widow lived there till the 1930s.

Tenement at No.23
1912, by Georg Baesler
Art Nouveau
Similarly to the building at No.21, this one has also been commissioned by Józef Grabowski, a painter and realized by Georg Baesler.

Knez (Vlach leader)

A knez or kenez (; ; ) was the hereditary leader of the Vlach (or Romanian) communities, primarily in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary.
Terminology.
Official documents, written in Latin, applied multiple terms when they mentioned the Vlach leaders (or chiefs) in the Kingdom of Hungary in the 13th and 14th centuries. The most widely used terms"kenezius" and its variantsderived from the Slavic "knyaz" ("ruler"). The office was closely associated with communities living according to the "Vlach law", thus the term "knez" was replaced by the term "scultetus" in the northeastern regions, where German law prevailed. A territory subjected to the authority of a "knez" was known as "keneziatus" (or "keneziate"). Several "keneziates" formed a "voivodate", which was subjected to a higher official, the "voivode".

Natacha Lesueur

Natacha Lesueur (born 1 August 1971) is a French photographer and plasticist.
She lives and works in Paris.
Life.
Lesueur was born at Cannes. She studied not at a photography academy but at the Villa Arson ("École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts à la Villa Arson") in Nice. While there she came to the realisation that photography would become her principal artistic medium. Her first personal exhibition took place in 1996. In 2000 she was a winner of the "Prix Ricard", and she was visual artist in residence at the Villa Medici during 2002/03. She has exhibited in a number of European countries, in the United States of America, South Korea and China. A retrospective of her work was produced by the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Geneva in 2011.
Natacha Lesueur teaches at the at Lausanne and at the European Academy of Art at Rennes.
Work.
Since 1993 the starting point for Natacha Lesueur's artistic output has been photographic. But even if the photography, in the final analysis, determines its own interaction with the finished piece, the structure of the work is built up like a painting in a succession of layers. The photographic image ends up fulfilling the role of a varnish on the totality of the composition. Many of her artistic priorities express themselves through the body, the appearance of its structure, and the intimate association sustained between flesh and food.
Lesueur produces a series, whereby her works follow one another but without overtly resembling one another, unfolding in seemingly infinite variety, in terms of themes, trompe-l'œil and optical traps that resonate between each other to create an overall unity. Half of her photographic output juxtaposes the body with food. Examples include "aspics en guise de bonnets de bain" ("Aspics in the form of bathing caps" - 1997/98), "Peau de saumon comme résille de chignon" ("Salmon skins as fishing nets"), "ambes gainées de crépine de porc " ("Legs wrapped in membranes of pork" - 1997/98), "bouches dont les dents sont des graines de toutes sortes" ("human mouths with a diversity of seeds in place of teeth" - 2000). In other images women's bodies are marked with pearl imprints (1994–96), with eye-test charts (2000-2001), with a sleeping man's face inscribed with a pen (2004), carved finger nails (1997-2003), or women whose teeth are varnished with red, bursting into laughter. In a series she created between 2009 and 2011 she worked with the same fortyish year old model who was pregnant during (some of) this time, to re-evaluate the figure of the Brazilian actress Carmen Miranda, formerly used by Hollywood as an exotic caricature "prototype". She uses the body as a "writing/drawing surface" and a semi-regular backing for images of culinary preparations, footprints and/or portrait-sculptures.

Boyar of Fogaras

The boyars of Fogaras (now Făgăraș in Romania) were a group of Vlach (or Romanian) conditional nobles in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary and the Principality (and Grand Principality) of Transylvania.
Background.
The earliest royal charter which mentioned the Vlachs' presence in southern Transylvania was issued in the early 13th century. The document recorded that Andrew II of Hungary had deprived the local Vlachs from a small territory between the rivers Olt, Arpaș (Árpás) and Cârțișoara and granted it to the newly established Cistercian Kerc Abbey. A hoard of hacksilver discovered at Cârțișoara, which contained a Byzantine coin from the first half of the 12th century, also confirm the Vlachs' presence in the region. The earliest record about a permanent Vlach settlement in the region"Kerch Olachorum" (or "Vlachs' Kerc" at present-day Cârțișoara)was made in 1332. Decades later, the first place names of Romanian origin were also recorded: Cuciulata in 1372 and Mândra in 1401.
Louis I of Hungary forced Vladislav I of Wallachia to accept his suzerainty in 1366. To secure Vladislav's loyalty, the king also granted him landed property in southern Transylvania, including the district of Fogaras (around present-day Făgăraș in Romania). Six years later, Vladislav donated estates to Wallachian boyars (or noblemen) in the district. Most of Vladislav's successors who also held FogarasMircea the Elder, Vlad the Impaler, Radu the Fair and Basarab Laiotăregularly granted estates to their boyars or awarded the heads of the local communities with the title boyar.
History.
In 1372 Vladislav I of Wallachia gave to the magistrate Ladislau de Dopca, his relative, five estates in the district of Fogaras. Mircea I of Wallachia gives the village of Szkore to Stanciul the hegumen and his brother Călin, and in 1400 he strengthens to his boyars Micul and Stoia the dominion over half of the village of Mondra. The boyars Ion, Borcea and Călin had during Mircea's reign three villages with the mountains that belonged to them, and the boyar Costea had two and a half villages.
Through a document from June 10, 1417, Mircea I of Wallachia strengthened "Ion", "Borcea" and "Calian",
We mention that the "Borcea" family name still exists in Vad, and the "Calian" family name is found in the neighboring village, Sinke.
In 1437 the boyar Stanciu and his brother Roman receive from Vlad II Dracul the village of Voivodeni/Vajdafalva. The increase of the boyar from Fogaras was observed in the richer donations, so in 1473 the family of the master Stoica Naneș obtained from Radu cel Frumos more than 13 villages and 3 mountains.
Towards the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the following century, the history of Fogaras disctrict experienced a more turbulent period. In 1508 a boyar revolt tried unsuccessfully to bring the country under the rule of the Muntenian voivode Mihnea cel Rău. 
The 1640 conscription counts 248 boyars in the Fogaras domain. In 1648, 87 boyars appeared in the fields of Porumbáktanya and Kwmana (Komána/Comăna).
Zsuzsanna Lorántffy (1600-1660), the wife of the prince of Transylvania George I Rákóczi, the mistress of the Făgăraș Citadel, issued 21 boyar diplomas, in some cases confirming "their old boyar rights". Residents of Bucsum, Also Uczya (Alsóucsa/Ucea de Sus), Also Venechia (Veneția de Jos), Dragos (Drăguș), Sinke, Hirszen (Hârseni) received such diplomas.
In the conscription from 1720-1721 in 53 villages belonging to the Făgăraș, Porumbac and Comăna domains, 725 boyars have appeared.

The Dream Lover (short story collection)

The Dream Lover: Short Stories is a collection of short stories by the Scottish writer William Boyd that were written at the start of Boyd's career. It was published in 2008 by Bloomsbury. "The Dream Lover" combines two previous books of short stories: "On the Yankee Station" and "The Destiny of Nathalie 'X"'.
Reception.
Writing in the "Financial Times", Jerome de Groote said that Boyd's book "demonstrates both the broad range of his imagination and the development of his taut prose style".
In a review for "The Observer", Vanessa Thorpe said: "Boyd believes the short form has been key to his evolution as a writer. He says in his introduction to this selection, drawn from across his career, that these brief escapades have allowed him to vary his style and technique... Passive or accidental observers, [including] the title story of the collection, 'Dream Lover', are crucial to what Boyd does. It is the simple, heartfelt stories which are the most vivid. All of them though, even the ones that crawl inside the heads of some quite creepy folk, such as 'My Girl in Skin-Tight Jeans' or 'Not Yet, Jayette', are compelling".
Laurence Phelan, reviewing the book for "The Independent on Sunday", said: "If there can be said to be a common thread, it's nothing more than the infinite vagaries of the human heart and the complexities of the mind... All that links them is their erudition, refined prose-style and precisely honed form".

Comprehensive Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Palestine

The Comprehensive Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Palestine is an agreement signed on 26 June 2015 between the Holy See and the Palestine Authority, representing the State of Palestine, that followed from the Basic Agreement between the Holy See and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of 15 February 2000. It regulates the rights and obligations of the Catholic Church in areas of the Palestinian Authority, and reflects Holy See support of Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. 
Historical background.
The Holy See has been an ardent supporter of the Palestinian political struggle for an independent state since 1967. This support, in addition to the desire to gain support for the Catholic Church from within the Palestinian community in the Palestinian territories under Israeli control, led to a process of gradually growing cooperation between the Holy See and the PLO, and later also the Palestinian authority. One such step was the meeting of Pope John Paul II and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in 1987. Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords, the Holy See embarked on negotiations with the Palestinian leadership to regulate Catholic Church activities in areas under Palestinian control. This was done in parallel with negotiations with the Israel to the same effect in Israeli controlled territories. Relations of special nature not defined as "diplomatic" were established between the Holy See and PLO on 26 October 1994.
Negotiations between the Holy See and the PLO led to the signing of a Basic Agreement on 15 February 2000, which committed the PLO to respect freedom of religion in general, as well as freedom of action for Catholic communities and establishments under Palestinian control. A more comprehensive agreement was concluded on 26 June 2015, with effect on 2 January 2016.
Provisions of the agreement.
The Comprehensive Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Palestine consists of a preamble and 32 articles dealing with general principles of freedom of religion, organizational rights of the Catholic Church in Palestinian Authority areas, respect for holy places and personal status of Catholics. Its preamble shows support for Palestinian aspirations of independence by recognizing a "State of Palestine" that consists of all the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem. This stipulation has angered the Israeli government, that does not recognize the State of Palestine.
International reactions.
Israel.
The Israeli government has deplored the conclusion of the 2015 agreement. Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman termed it as one-sided for not recognizing the rights of the Jewish people in what it termed "Land of Israel" as well as not taking into consideration the places in Jerusalem holy for Judaism. The Israeli statement also claimed that recognizing the Palestinian Authority as a state damages the peace process by strengthening Palestinian refusal to negotiate.

Ornithoteuthis antillarum

Ornithoteuthis antillarum, the Atlantic bird squid, is a species of flying squid from the family Ommastrephidae which is found in the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean. This species is an important component of the diet of many species of fish and of cetaceans. It is taken as a bycatch in fisheries but has the potential to be commercially important if appropriate fishing methods can be developed.
Description.
"Ornithoteuthis antillarum" has a thin, elongated and muscular mantle which ends in a long, thinly-pointed tail. Its fins are also elongated and are arrow shaped, with sharp tips, concave rear margins and convex forward margins. The largest individual recorded had a mantle length of 300 mm and was from the more northerly extremity of the species' distribution. The length of the fins is more than half that of the mantle. Within the mantle cavity there are three visceral photophores, an oval, anal photophore, a posterior intestinal photophore and an elongated posterior visceral photophore which forms a strip. It has a broad head which is at least as wide as the mantle and there is an elongated photophore patch on the ventral surface of both eyes. The tentacular clubs have a sucker-bearing region which is approximately half of the length of the tentacles with large suckers on the manus with 18-20 widely separated sharp, round and curved teeth on the margin while the suckers on the dactylus are larger in the ventral series and smallest in the dorsal series. The sucker teeth are sexually dimorphic on all of the arms with the females having about 8 plate-like teeth in the proximal margin with the teeth becoming more numerous and pointed in the mid-arm while the males have large plate like teeth on the lateral margins of the mid-arm suckers. The fourth right arm is hectocotylised and has small distal suckers with the skin taking the form of a honeycomb on middle of the arm's ventral surface, this consists of 4 or 5 longitudinal lines of depressions each with 20 to 25 pores.
Distribution.
"Ornithoteuthis antillarum" is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern and western Atlantic, being found between 20°N and 25°S in the eastern Atlantic and from 40°N to 40°S in the western Atlantic. The type specimen was taken near Basse Terre, Guadeloupe.
Habitat and biology.
"Ornithoteuthis antillarum" is a pelagic, oceanic species which is thought to be commonest near continental slopes. It is at its most abundant at depths between 100m and 600 m. The paralarvae and adults are relatively common in the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida and in the Gulf Stream, extending south into the Caribbean Sea and to the waters over the continental slope off Brazil. It does not seem to be a schooling speciesbut sampling suggests that it is common from the middle of the water column to very near the bottom, although it has never been reported to sit on the bottom. In the Caribbean this species has been recorded at
the surface at night, with many specimens being captured at night over deep bottom depths in the eastern South Atlantic between 100m and 600m in depth. Sampling also suggests that "O. antillarum" lives above the seabed during the day, dispersing upwards at night, a partial diel migrant.
It is a fast swimmer, which enables it to avoid being caught in nets but it has been observed from submersibles and videoed. It typically rests in the water column in a posture known as the “J” posture, this involves the squid hanging roughly head-down with its arms and tentacles curled and slightly spread back over the head and nearby mantle. "O. antillarum" is a fast-growing species and its maximum life span is 182 days. Growth rates, as measured on statolith increments which represent daily growth lines, slow markedly as the animal matures. The sex ratio is 1:1 and as the population matures it is believed that they undergo a spawning migration into areas associated with sea mounts. The earlier life stages are found in midwater in epipelagic to mesopelagic zones over slopes, tops and oceanic depths, then the sexually mature adults migrate waters associated with sea mounts and oceanic ridges to spawn on or near the bottom. The spermatophores are 9.0 mm in length and they are found in relatively low numbers compared to related species, with up to 100 but normally 50-60 present in the Needham's sac for each male. The eggs are very small, being 0.7 to 1.0 mm in diameter. They spawn intermittently in pulses or batches laying several egg masses over an extended time with the frequency of spawning and the amount of eggs per mass being roughly the same over the spawning period. The smaller females from the warmer waters of the tropical central-east Atlantic bear between 50 000 to 220 000 oocytes and eggs are laid intermittently in egg masses of up to 1,500 eggs over a spawning period which last from six weeks to three months. Spawning appears to occur throughout the year and there are peaks of spawning activity in April–May, August–September and December–January in the eastern-central Atlantic.
"O. antillarum" preys on many different types of prey and each individual prey item has a low weight, the most common prey is amphipods but it also eats the larvae and fry of squid and carnivorous fish. An individual with a mantle length of 140 mm was photographed from a submersible at 684 m in depth and a water temperature of 10.7 °C in the Bahamas eating an adult bristlemouth "Gonostoma elongata", a midwater fish. Prey changes as the squid matures, the smaller individuals, with a mantle length of less than 4mm, mainly prey on copepods, however krill are probably are more important energetically but they are less frequently taken. One they attain a mantle length of greater than 4mm decapod crustaceans and cephalopods are the most important prey items.
"O. antillarum" has a number of predators and these include epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and they have been recorded in the diets of fish such as common dolphinfish ("Coryphaena hyppurus"), Atlantic sailfishes ("Istiophorus albicans"), skipjack tuna ("Katsuwonus pelamus"), white marlin ("Tetrapturus albidus"), albacore ("Thunnus alalunga"), yellowfin tuna ("Thunnus albacares"), bigeye tuna ("Thunnus obesus"), swordfish ("Xiphias gladius"). They are also preyed upon by cetaceans) including the pygmy sperm whale ("Kogia breviceps") and orca ("Orcinus orca"). With bony fish, "O. antillarum" are the most important component of the winter diet of yellowfin tuna off Brazil. It is parasitised mainly by didymozoid trematodes, however, the intensity of infection is much reduced compared to same-sized specimens of "Sthenoteuthis pteropus".
Fisheries.
"Ornithoteuthis antillarum" is not a target species for fisheries but may be taken as bycatch, however, it could become a quarry species for commercial fisheries if a suitable fishing technique is developed, because this is a common species which could sustain a harvest and its flesh is firm, muscular and palatable.

Anna Sarauw

Anna Elisabeth Sarauw née Elberling (1839–1919) was a Danish textile artist who collaborated with Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesbøll in running a successful embroidery business in Copenhagen. She designed sewing patterns, with naturalistic motifs and stylized Egyptian, Indian and Pompeiian figures.
Biography.
Born in Frederiknagore (now Serampore) in Danish India, Anna Elisabeth Elberling was the daughter of the Danish government representative Frederik Emil Elberling (1804–80) and Harriet Anna Fjellerup (1821–59). The oldest of nine children, she was brought up in the west of India. She learnt to sew as a child, completing a finely embroidered gown for her mother before she was 10 years old.
The family moved back to Denmark in 1851. She helped to bring up her sisters, teaching them embroidery, especially after her mother's early death in 1859. In 1870, she married the estate administrator Carl Harald Sarauw (1839–1909) with whom she had four children.
As an embroiderer, Sarauw was noted for her light touch and her talent for creating her own designs, some of which she sold commercially. She befriended Constantin Hansen and his daughters Elise and Kristiane. After they opened a needlework shop and studio together with Johanne Bindesbøll, she joined them to create their "Kunstbroderiforretningen Konstantin-Hansen, Bindesbøll &amp; Sarauw", commonly known simply as "Boden". It is difficult to know which of the embroiderers created the various items but from Sarauw's sketchbooks it can be seen that many of her designs were inspired by her travels abroad. They include stylized figures from Egypt, Pompeii and India. She also created geometrical designs as well as rosettes and lilies.
In 1878, she represented "Boden" at the Paris World Fair and in 1888 she participated in the Nordic Exhibition in Copenhagen where she received a medal for an embroidered box. 
In 1881, she left Boden and moved with her husband to Sorø.
Anna Sarauw died in Vissenbjerg Sogn near Assens on 11 September 1919 and is buried in Sorø Cemetery. Her family maintains a large collection of her embroidered textiles, drawings and sewing patterns.

Disease X is a placeholder name that was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 on their shortlist of blueprint priority diseases to represent a hypothetical, unknown pathogen that could cause a future epidemic. The WHO adopted the placeholder name to ensure that their planning was sufficiently flexible to adapt to an unknown pathogen (e.g. broader vaccines and manufacturing facilities). Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci stated that the concept of Disease X would encourage WHO projects to focus their research efforts on entire classes of viruses (e.g. flaviviruses), instead of just individual strains (e.g. zika virus), thus improving WHO capability to respond to unforeseen strains. In 2020, it was speculated, including among some of the WHO's own expert advisors, that COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, met the requirements to be the first Disease X.
Rationale.
In May 2015, in pandemic preparations prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO was asked by member organizations to create an "R&amp;D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics" to generate ideas that would reduce the time lag between the identification of viral outbreaks and the approval of vaccines/treatments, to stop the outbreaks from turning into a "public health emergency". The focus was to be on the most serious emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) for which few preventive options were available. A group of global experts, the "R&amp;D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group", was assembled by the WHO to draft a shortlist of less than ten "blueprint priority diseases".
Since 2015, the shortlist of less than 10 EIDs has been updated annually and has consistently included widely known names such as Ebola, Zika and SARS (e.g. cause of large-scale infections), and more geographically specific names such as Lassa fever, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever, and Nipah virus.
In February 2018, after the "2018 R&amp;D Blueprint" meeting in Geneva, the WHO added Disease X to the shortlist as a placeholder for a "knowable unknown" pathogen. The Disease X placeholder acknowledged the potential for a future epidemic that could be caused by an unknown pathogen, and by its inclusion, challenged the WHO to ensure their planning and capabilities were flexible enough to adapt to such an event.
At the 2018 announcement of the updated shortlist of blueprint priority diseases, the WHO said: "Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease". John-Arne Røttingen, of the R&amp;D Blueprint Special Advisory Group, said: "History tells us that it is likely the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before", and "It may seem strange to be adding an 'X' but the point is to make sure we prepare and plan flexibly in terms of vaccines and diagnostic tests. We want to see 'plug and play' platforms developed which will work for any, or a wide number of diseases; systems that will allow us to create countermeasures at speed". US expert Anthony Fauci said: "WHO recognizes it must 'nimbly move' and this involves creating platform technologies", and that to develop such platforms, WHO would have to research entire classes of viruses, highlighting flaviviruses. He added: "If you develop an understanding of the commonalities of those, you can respond more rapidly".
Adoption.
Jonathan D. Quick, author of "End of Epidemics", described the WHO's act of naming Disease X as "wise in terms of communicating risk", saying "panic and complacency are the hallmarks of the world's response to infectious diseases, with complacency currently in the ascendance". "Women's Health" wrote that the establishment of the term "might seem like an uncool move designed to incite panic" but that the whole purpose of including it on the list was to "get it on people's radars".
Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), wrote "It might sound like science fiction, but Disease X is something we must prepare for", noting that despite the success in controlling the 2014 Western African Ebola virus epidemic, strains of the disease had returned in 2018. In February 2019, CEPI announced funding of US$34 million to the German-based CureVac biopharmaceutical company to develop an "RNA Printer prototype", that CEPI said could "prepare for rapid response to unknown pathogens (i.e., Disease X)".
Parallels were drawn with the efforts by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and their PREDICT programme, which was designed to act as an early warning pandemic system, by sourcing and researching animal viruses in particular "hot spots" of animal-human interaction.
In September 2019, "The Daily Telegraph" reported on how Public Health England (PHE) had launched its own investigation for a potential Disease X in the United Kingdom from the diverse range of diseases reported in their health system; they noted that 12 novel diseases and/or viruses had been recorded by PHE in the last decade.
In October 2019 in New York, the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme ran a "Disease X dummy run" to simulate a global pandemic by a Disease X, in order for its 150 participants from various world health agencies and public health systems to better prepare and share ideas and observations for combatting such an eventuality.
In March 2020, "The Lancet Infectious Diseases" published a paper titled "Disease X: accelerating the development of medical countermeasures for the next pandemic", which expanded the term to include Pathogen X (the pathogen that leads to Disease X), and identified areas of product development and international coordination that would help in combatting any future Disease X.
In April 2020, "The Daily Telegraph" described remdesivir, a drug being trialed to combat COVID-19, as an anti-viral that Gilead Sciences started working on a decade previously to treat a future Disease X.
Candidates.
Zoonotic viruses.
On the addition of Disease X in 2018, the WHO said it could come from many sources citing haemorrhagic fevers and the more recent non-polio enterovirus. However, Røttingen speculated that Disease X would be more likely come from zoonotic transmission (an animal virus that jumps to humans), saying: "It's a natural process and it is vital that we are aware and prepare. It is probably the greatest risk". WHO special advisor Professor Marion Koopmans, also noted that the rate at which zoonotic diseases were appearing was accelerating, saying: "The intensity of animal and human contact is becoming much greater as the world develops. This makes it more likely new diseases will emerge but also modern travel and trade make it much more likely they will spread".
H7N9 (2018).
In 2018, a new strain of the H7N9 "bird flu" virus, with a 38 percent mortality rate, was likened to a potential Disease X by some international health authorities (but not the WHO, or the R&amp;D Blueprint group). China would not share samples of the new H7N9 strain. However, they eventually brought the outbreak under control and the urgency dissipated.
COVID-19 (2019–present).
From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have speculated whether COVID-19 met the criteria to be Disease X. In early February 2020, Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, wrote that the first Disease X is from a coronavirus. Later that month, Marion Koopmans, Head of Viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, and a member of the WHO's R&amp;D Blueprint Special Advisory Group, wrote in scientific journal "Cell", "Whether it will be contained or not, this outbreak is rapidly becoming the first true pandemic challenge that fits the disease X category". At the same time, Peter Daszak, also a member of the WHO's R&amp;D Blueprint, wrote in an opinion piece in "The New York Times" saying: "In a nutshell, Covid-19 is Disease X".
Synthetic viruses / bioweapons.
At the 2018 announcement of the updated shortlist of blueprint priority diseases, the media speculated that a future Disease X could be created intentionally as a biological weapon. In 2018, WHO R&amp;D Blueprint Special Advisor Group member Røttingen was questioned about the potential of Disease X to come from the ability of gene-editing technology to produce synthetic viruses (e.g. the 2017 synthesis of Orthopoxvirus in Canada was cited), which could be released through an accident or even an act of terror. Røttingen said it was unlikely that a future Disease X would originate from a synthetic virus or a bio-weapon. However, he noted the seriousness of such an event, saying, "Synthetic biology allows for the creation of deadly new viruses. It is also the case that where you have a new disease there is no resistance in the population and that means it can spread fast".
Bacterial infection.
In September 2019, Public Health England (PHE) reported that the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria, even to "last-resort" antibiotics such as carbapenems and colistin, could also turn into a potential Disease X, citing the antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea as an example.
In popular culture.
In 2018, the Museum of London ran an exhibition titled "Disease X: London's next epidemic?", hosted for the centenary of the Spanish flu epidemic from 1918.
The term features in the title of several fiction books that involve global pandemic diseases, such as "Disease " (2020), and "Disease X: The Outbreak" (2019).

132nd Illinois Infantry Regiment

The 132nd Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment of the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was among scores of regiments that were raised in the summer of 1864 as Hundred Days Men, an effort to augment existing manpower for an all-out push to end the war within 100 days and served its term of enlistment as a garrison unit in Paducah, Kentucky.
History.
The 132nd Illinois was organized at Camp Fry in Chicago and mustered in for 100 days on 1 June 1864, under the command of Colonel Thomas J. Pickett. Company A was composed of men from LaSalle and Cook counties, Company B of men from Cook and Fulton counties, Company C of men from Kane and Kendall counties, Company D of men from Fulton and Peoria Counties, Company E of men from Fulton County, Company F of men from Dekalb County, Company G of men from Cook, Henry, and Knox counties, Company H of men from Rock Island County, Company I of men from Cook County, and Company K of men from Cook, Dekalb, and Winnebago counties.
The regiment departed for Columbus, Kentucky, on 6 June, arriving there two days later. It was attached to the District of Columbus, Kentucky, part of the 6th Division, XVI Corps, Department of the Tennessee. The regiment relocated to Paducah on 15 June, where it spent the rest of its service on garrison duty. After pro-Confederate guerrillas were reported to have fired shots at boats on the Tennessee River and harassed Unionists, an expedition of 200 men from the 132nd Illinois and 400 men from the 8th United States Colored Heavy Artillery under the command of 132nd Illinois Major John H. Peck was sent to Haddix's Ferry below Aurora on 25 July. After landing there two days later, the expedition pursued a group of guerrillas inland and routed them, killing five, wounding several, and capturing seven.
From August to October the regiment was assigned to the District of Columbus as part of the Department of the Ohio. After the conclusion of 100 days the 132nd Illinois returned to Chicago, where it was mustered out on 17 October. During its service, it lost twelve men to disease, its only casualties.

Empty book

Empty books or blank books are novelty books whose title indicates that they treat some serious subject, but whose pages have been left intentionally blank. A number of such titles have been published as attempts at satire or polemic, to some commercial success.
The joke is that "nothing" is the answer to whatever the title of the book asserts. In 2017, "The Guardian" commented that the trend of publishing political empty books had led to "the noble art of political parody [descending] into a one-joke turn that avoids words".
List of empty books.
This list includes, in order of publication, empty books that have been published with an ISBN or have received coverage in reliable sources unrelated to the author. The books may have book design features such as front matter, a table of contents, page numbers, etc., as long as the pages are otherwise blank.

Dua Tawassul

Dua Tawassul is the name for various supplications in Shia Islam although there exists one more well-known Dua with the same name. This prominent supplication has been written in the book of "Bihar al-Anwar". The Shi'ites within Iran recite it altogether in religious places on Tuesday eves. it can also be recited to bless a community/gathering.
Meaning of Du'a.
Du'a (or supplication) literally means invocation; according to it, the servants of Allah request or call out Allah for their material and spiritual demands or wishes.
Meaning of Tawassul.
Tawassul is regarded among the teachings of Shia Islam and most of Muslims, which means to make to take hold of somebody or something that is in a high rank before Allah, and its purpose is getting near to Him and also granting the requests.
Source of Dua.
Dua Tawassul which is mentioned in "Mafatih al-Janan" originates from the book of "Bihar al-Anwar". Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi mentions that: "I found this dua in an old manuscript which was written by one of our companions, and it is quoted that: Muhammad ibn Babawayh has narrated this dua from Imams, and for whatever request I recited it, it was granted right away."
It is also narrated by Famous Shia Cleric Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who learned this Dua in dream when he saw Imam Mahdi (A.S).

Louis-Jacques Rondeleux

Louis-Jacques Rondeleux (24 October 1923 – 2 November 2000) was a 20th-century French lyrical artist (baritone).
Biography.
After studying eclectic topics (mathematics, history, philosophy and theology), Rondeleux began his career in the Catholic clergy. He entered the Major Seminary of Paris (1941–1944) and after a short period of service in the army (December 1944–August 1945) he began a novitiate with the Dominican friars. After 9 months with the Dominicans he gave up his ecclesiastical career (1946).
It was only in the early 1950s that he decided to become a professional singer. He made a career in the 1950s and 1960s during which he explored all repertoires, from medieval musics and troubador and trouvères songs to contemporary creation, through Baroque music and mélodies.
From 1970 to 1989 he was a singing teacher.
The lyrical artist (1951–1970).
In the late forties Louis-Jacques Rondeleux was a pupil of Jane Bathori, mezzo-soprano, creator of most of Maurice Ravel's melodies. She will pass on to him her art in the interpretation of melodies.
His career as a professional singer began in 1951, as member in the choirs of Élisabeth Brasseur or as a church singer (cantor) (particularly at the Église de la Trinité. In October 1951, he sang for the first time as a soloist under the direction of André Cluytens during a concert in Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (Duruflé's "Requiem Op.9", Florent Schmitt's "Psaume" XLVII). He soon became acquainted with many composers and conductors with whom he helped to promote contemporary music (Henri Sauguet, Darius Milhaud, Marcel Landowski, Míkis Theodorákis, Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, Manuel Rosenthal, Frank Martin, Henri Tomasi, Pierre Boulez…).
In 1954 he took part - still as a chorister - in two musical-theatrical creations of the compagnie Renaud-Barrault:
On 30 July 1954 at Aix-en-Provence, he was soloist at the time of the premiere of Sauguet's "Les Caprices de Marianne" opera.
In 1957, he recorded his first disc with works by Darius Milhaud and Henri Sauguet ("Visions infernales").
In 1960, he performed two premieres:
In the same year, he toured Morocco with the Jeunesses musicales de France (JMF).
He also made his first televised recording in "La Traviata" (broadcast on 9 December 1960).
In 1963 he collaborated, under the direction of Pierre Boulez, on the homage album to Igor Stravinsky (.
On 15 June 1963 at the festival de Strasbourg, he performed with the orchestre radio-lyrique de l'ORTF, under the direction of Charles Bruck, Henri Tomasi's "le Silence de la mer", after Vercors (cf. Site de l’association Henri Tomasi.) This "lyrical drama" will give rise to several performances in the theatre as well as a recording for television (broadcast on 7 February 1965).
In 1964 he also recorded a disc for the Harmonia Mundi label: "Cantigas et Chansons de Troubadours" (). In this disc, he inaugurated a revival of interest in medieval music that had not been sung for centuries.
In January 1965, Henry Barraud entrusted him with the creation of his motet "Pange Lingua" (a tribute to Rameau), a cantata for soprano, baritone, choir and orchestra.
Henri Sauguet wrote about Louis-Jacques Rondeleux: Henri Sauguet Paris December 1963.
The pedagogue (1966–1989).
From 1966 Louis-Jacques Rondeleux began a second career, dedicated to teaching. He first worked part-time as a singing teacher at the Montreuil Conservatory (1966–1969).
In 1970, he joined Maurice Béjart in Brussels for the premiere of the , a new multidisciplinary training centre for dancers, where he will be responsible for vocal technique.
In Belgium, he subsequently worked (in 1973) with Henri Pousseur at the Centre de recherches musicales de Wallonie (now , in Liège. There, he set up vocal workshops specifically oriented towards singing.
In 1974, - who has just been appointed to the management of the Conservatoire national supérieur d’art dramatique de Paris - asked him to teach singing to future actors. Louis-Jacques Rondeleux taught there from 1975 to 1989, when he retired.
In 1977, in an effort to pass on the fruits of his experience to as many people as possible, he published a book entitled "Trouver sa voix" at éditions du Seuil. "Trouver sa voix" is a practical book, in which Louis-Jacques Rondeleux updates a voice work technique essentially oriented towards raising awareness of the body schema and an awareness of the mechanics of breath. But throughout the proposed exercises, even more so than the voice, we construct ourselves because "it is through the voice that the conscious opens up to the unconscious, and man to himself and to the Other" (Denis Vasse, "L'Ombilic et la Voix").
Several times reissued, this book was a great success. Between phoniatric and theatrical experience, it is recognized by amateurs and professionals alike.
Writing and Parkinson's disease.
In the early 1950s, Louis-Jacques Rondeleux collaborated with the editorial secretariat of the Esprit magazine (1951 to 1953). Very involved in ideological debates within the Catholic Church, he participates in some of these debates through writing. This commitment will lead him to publish two books, "Isaïe et le Prophétisme" (1961) at Éditions du Seuil and "Jean Steinmann" (1969) at éditions Fleurus.
Alongside his friend he helped create a magazine, "les Mal Pensants" which wanted to be a place of expression for "left-wing" Catholics; he wrote - in the first issue - the editorial under the title "Who are we?".
He will also collaborate in the establishment of a repertoire of songs dedicated to worship. With Marcel Frémiot he published certain liturgical songs on texts taken from the Bible and translated by him. (St Jacques du Haut-Pas); 1965. Excerpts published in "Chanter pour Dieu", ed. du Seuil, Paris 1966). With Jean Bonfils and he contributed to the same series "Chanter pour Dieu" (éd. du Seuil, 1967).
His Parkinson's disease, diagnosed at the beginning of the 1980s will profoundly change his last 15 years of existence. In an article published in a specialized journal, he explains how certain symptoms of this disease (quakes, muscular rigidity, hyper-emotionality, stuttering...) can be combated by a targeted work on voice and breath, body and mind work.
The writing of a third book (Éditions du Seuil) - which remained unpublished - will give him the opportunity to give a personal testimony on the different phases of the evolution of his fight against the Parkinson's disease between 1981 and 2000

Both Lives Matter

Both Lives Matter is a pro-life advocacy organisation in Northern Ireland which claims to seek to "re-frame the abortion debate in Northern Ireland and beyond, to advocate for better care in pregnancy crisis, to create a life-affirming culture that values each woman and her unborn child and to safe-guard the current law which protects both women and unborn children". The organization was established in 2017 and co-founded by Dawn McAvoy.
Both Lives Matter conducted a billboard campaign in two locations in Northern Ireland in January 2017 featuring the headline: "100,000 people are alive today because of our laws on abortion. Why change that?". This refers to abortions not performed due to Northern Ireland's exclusion from the Abortion Act, passed in 1967. In response to the placement of the billboards, 14 complaints were being lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority, which were dismissed on the grounds that while the claim was an "estimate", "On balance, we concluded that the evidence indicated that there was a reasonable probability that around 100,000 people were alive in Northern Ireland today who would have otherwise been aborted had it been legal to do so".
The '100,000' billboard campaign won the Northern Ireland Public Affairs Campaign of the Year for 2017, awarded by the Public Relations and Communications Association. It was the only campaign in the running for the award.
The group has been criticised for "hijacking Black Lives Matter"; in "The Guardian", Elizabeth Nelson of the Belfast Feminist Network described it as "a cynical attempt to spin the language of human rights into froth to hide their true agenda – the subjugation of women."

"N"-Methyltaurine (2-methylaminoethanesulfonic acid) is an aminosulfonic acid which is present as a zwitterion in the crystalline state and in polar solvents (just like amino acids). In contrast to the widespread taurine, "N"-methyltaurine has been found in nature only in red algae, where it is formed by methylation of taurine. It is suitable for esterification (actually amide formation) with long-chain carboxylic acids to taurides (acylaminoethansulfonaten) because of its high polarity and the relatively good solubility of its alkaline earth metal salts, which are also used as mild anionic surfactants.
Preparation.
The synthesis of "N"-methyltaurine was reported as early as 1878, with methylamine being reacted with the silver salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid. An obvious modification for this reaction is the replacement of the silver salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid by the sodium salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid. The addition of methylamine to sodium vinylsulfonate in aqueous solution gives "N"-methyltaurine in 85% yield after acidification with acetic acid. The purification of the crude product and preparation of the N-methyltaurine can also be accomplished by passage of the sodium salt solution through a cation exchange resin in its H form and then through an anion exchange resin in its OH form. The reaction of sodium isethionate with methylamine in water at high temperature and pressure yields the sodium salt of "N"-methyltaurine
which yields pure "N"-methyltaurine upon saturation with CO2 and removal of the precipitated sodium bicarbonate.
Properties.
"N"-Methyltaurine is a white powdery solid which is readily soluble in water.
Use.
"N"-Methyltaurine (or its sodium salt) is used as a polar head group in surfactants from the class of taurides (acylaminoethanesulfonates), sometimes also called methyltaurates. The Taurides are characterized by excellent foaming - even in the presence of oil and skin fats - and foam stability, with good skin compatibility and broad pH stability. The market breakthrough for "N"-methyltaurine as a hair restorer is still pending.

The Museum of Everything (museum)

The Museum of Everything is a non-profit organisation and platform which stages installations of art by private, self-taught and non-academic art-makers (sometimes referred to as art brut or outsider art).
Establishment and description.
The Museum of Everything staged its first exhibition in London in October 2009. It then continued to present large-scale surveys at different locations around the world, working within and alongside partner institutions and organisations. 
The first location for The Museum of Everything was a former dairy and recording studio in Primrose Hill, London. It was here that it first staged its celebrated exhibitions (2009/2010). The Museum of Everything then travelled to other venues, including: Selfridges, the department store and former hotel in London (2011); Chalet Society, a temporary space in Boulevard Raspail, Paris (2012/13); and Serra dei Giardini, Venice (2013) as part of the 55th Venice Biennale. The Museum of Everything also created installations at public and private museums, including: Tate Modern, London (2010); Pinacoteca Agnelli, Turin (2010); Garage, Moscow (2012); Hayward Gallery, London (2013); Kunsthal Rotterdam, Rotterdam (2016); and Museum of Old and New Art, Tasmania (2017/18).
The museum has described the material on display as "untrained, unintentional, undiscovered and unclassifiable". More importantly, it rejects much of the terminology of otherness, notably that of "outsider art". Exhibitions are generally surveys of material from makers around the world. The 2017/2018 exhibition at Mona in Tasmania presented almost 2,000 artworks by over 100 artists.
Artists included in the exhibitions.
The Museum of Everything presents works by hundreds of artists, including:

1926 World Table Tennis Championships – Men's Team

The 1926 World Table Tennis Championships – Swaythling Cup (Men's Team) was the first edition of the men's team championship. 
The cup was named the Swaythling Cup because it was named after the Dowager Lady Swaythling (the mother of Ivor Montagu) who presented the trophy to the English Table Tennis Association in 1926.
Hungary defeated Austria 5-4 in a play off for the gold medal following the fact that they tied with five wins each in the main competition. The winning team consisted of Roland Jacobi, Zoltán Mechlovits, Béla von Kehrling and Daniel Pecsi.

Code of practice

A code of practice can be a document that complements occupational health and safety laws and regulations to provide detailed practical guidance on how to comply with legal obligations, and should be followed unless another solution with the same or better health and safety standard is in place, or may be a document for the same purpose published by a self-regulating body to be followed by member organisations.
Codes of practice published by governments do not replace the occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and are generally issued in terms of those laws and regulations. They are intended to help understand how to comply with the requirements of regulations. A workplace inspector can refer to a code of practice when issuing an improvement or prohibition notice, and they may be admissible in court proceedings. A court may use a code of practice to establish what is reasonably practicable action to manage a specific risk. Equivalent or better ways of achieving the required work health and safety may be possible, so compliance with codes of practice is not usually mandatory, providing that any alternative systems used provide a standard of health and safety equal to or better than those recommended by the code of practice.
Organisational codes of practice do not have the same authority under law, but serve a similar purpose. Member organisations generally undertake to comply with the codes of practice as a condition of membership and may lose membership if found to be in violation of the code.

Fascination (short story collection)

Fascination is a collection of short stories by the Scottish writer William Boyd. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2004 by Hamish Hamilton and in the United States in 2005 by Knopf Books.
Reviewing the book for "The Guardian", M. John Harrison said: "the stories collected here are perfect. They would seem a little too perfect if they weren't also suffused with an understanding of love, desire and emotional incompetence. Behind the comedy and the stacked sleights of hand, vulnerable people can be seen quite clearly, blundering about trying to make contact with one another; personal disaster lurks and real lives are lost."

Prem Nath Sahni

Prem Nath Sahni (P. N. Sahni, 1916-1990) was an Indian administrator who played an active role in industry., social life, administration, and sports of India for four decades. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1971 for his contributions to trade and industry.
Early life.
Sahni was born on 9 August 1916 in Lahore, British India to Lala Gurdas Ram Sahni an agricultural land holder with substantial land holdings. He was the oldest of three children of Lala Gurdas Ram sahni from his second wife who died within a month of giving birth to his sister, Nando (Nand Rani), eight years younger to him in 1924. P. N. Sahni completed a double Master of Arts degree in political Science as well as History from Government College at Lahore now known as the Government College University (Lahore). He was an enthusiastic hockey player in college and this interest in sports lasted with him through life. Subsequent to college studies in Lahore, he proceeded for doctoral studies in UK but the program was interrupted because of the second world war.
Provincial Transport Controller.
Sahni was appointed to the Indian Administrative Service with effect from 25 December 1957 by the President of India through a Gazette notification. One of the earliest administrative appointments of P. N. sahni was as the Provincial transport Controller of Punjab, India. During this period he was recognized for his excellent administrative capabilities and compassionate dealing. He introduced a system of concession for financially weak students upon certification by their schools as well as others in need.
Director of Industries.
During the sixties P. N. Sahni assumed the role of Director of Industries of Punjab. In 1966 the state of Punjab was divided in two with a new state Haryana being born from it. While the focus of Punjab remained on agriculture due to well irrigated lands, that of Haryana became industrialization. Sahni shifted to this new state and continued to play a prominent role in its industrialization, a role that was recognized later by an award for contributions to trade and industry by the Government of India.
Role in Indian hockey.
During the seventies P. N. Sahni was an active participant in the Indian Olympic Association. P. N. Sahni took over stewardship of the Indian Hockey Federation in 1973 at a time when conflicts broke out between its Northern and Southern wings. The Indian Hockey scene was marked by excellence until 1973 when Ashwani Kumar the then president stepped down followed by a spell of chaos in the organization. There was a conflict between the North and South blocs of the federation. P.N. Sahni belonged to the North bloc and that was the heartland of hockey in India. But one M. A. M. Ramaswamy, a rich millionaire from the southern block struggled to capture the presidency and succeeded because of support form the southern lobby in the Union government. It seems that this feud and the passing of control of Indian hockey to the southern wing led to the downfall of hockey standards in India. It lost its supremacy in the game on the world stage ever since winning a medal only once in the Olympic games in 1980. P N Sahni remained the President of the Haryana Olympic Association from 1969 to 1978 
Electricity Board.
In the early seventies, during his appointment as the Chairman of an Electricity Board in India, P N Sahni had to contend with numerous problems of employees union. He nevertheless managed to steer the board in a way so as to improve overall availability of electricity in the province much needed for the then rapidly industrializing Haryana state of Northern India. Sahni retired from Chairmanship of Haryana State Electricity Board on 5 March 1975, after serving this Organisation for six years. During his tenure, Haryana achieved 100% village electrification 
Death.
He died in 1990 in Mumbai from a sudden cardiac arrest while on a brief visit to that city to witness a cricket match. He was survived by a daughter and wife, Vimla Sahni at that time.

Dzungariotherium

Dzungariotherium is a genus of indricothere, an extinct group of large, hornless rhinos, which lived during the middle and late Oligocene of northwest China. The type species "D. orgosense" was described in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China.
Description.
The teeth of "D. orgosense" (from which that species is mainly known) are 25 percent larger than those of "Paraceratherium transouralicum", indicating that it was one of the largest known indricothere, but the teeth and skull was proportionally large compared to the body, making it smaller overall.
"Paraceratherium bugtiense" and "D. orgosense" share features such as relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that are relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extends less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation. "D. orgosense" is distinguished from "Paraceratherium" species by the larger size of its teeth, and distinct crochets of its molars.

Blackout (Steffany Gretzinger album)

Blackout (stylized in capital letters) is the second studio album from American singer and songwriter Steffany Gretzinger. It was released on March 30, 2018, through Bethel Music. Bobby Strand handled the production of the album.
Background.
Bethel Music announced that Steffany Gretzinger will be releasing "Blackout", her second studio album, would be released on March 30, 2018. This being her second solo studio effort, "Blackout" follows the issue of her commercially successful and critically acclaimed debut, "The Undoing" (2014). The album is said to be revealing the "vulnerable, less-visible side," of Steffany Gretzinger. This collection of songs is described as being created for the "in-between moments in life" which mould a person, they convey the idea that even in the chaotic situations of life, "[the] light that shines from the inside out cannot be dimmed." In a press release published on March 9, 2018, Gretzinger spoke of the album's message, saying: 
It's about being able to joyfully dance as tears stream down your face, knowing that life comes through learning to grieve and celebrate at the same time.
Promotion.
On March 9, 2018, Bethel Music announced the beginning of the album's pre-order period, with "Save Me" being released as a promotional single as it was availed for instant download and streaming.
Critical reception.
The reception of "Blackout" was largely positive as Gretzinger was lauded by various critics of the CCM and contemporary worship music genres.
Bestowing the album a perfect five stars in a CCM Magazine review, Matt Conner describes the album as a "possessing masterwork," declaring that it is "a career achievement if she decided for some reason to walk away tomorrow. " Anna Hockley, reviewing for Eden.co.uk says that "Blackout" is "not your average praise and worship CD. It's one that digs a little deeper and at times could be mistaken for something you'd hear in the Top 10 charts – and very much in a good way.
There are times throughout the album where you can hear her emotion and soul speak right to your heart and others where the musical arrangement behind the lyrics really take on a life of their own." Timothy Yap, rated the album three out of five in a Hallels review, asserting that the album "bears the marks of many singer-songwriter albums where it's personal with equal portions of emotions and intelligence," further describing Gretzinger's work as "coterminously ruminative as well as theological." Jesus Freak Hideout critic Josh Balogh awarded "Blackout" a four star rating, concludes, "with its powerful, engaging vocals, and catchy pop melodies, "Blackout" is a worshipful, not-to-be-missed album of 2018 sure to please longtime fans of Bethel musicians, and fans of the pop/worship genre." Hayden Royster of LightWorkers praised the album in his review, saying that "Blackout" is "something truly remarkable: a worship album that encapsulates both the human condition, the glory of God and everything in-between." In a superbly positive review by Kevin Davis of NewReleaseToday, he states "These moving and reverent recordings are poignant songs of adoration. Every song is completely anointed, Spirit-led and emotionally captivating." At Today's Christian Entertainment, Kelly Meade gave the album a rating of three-point-four stars out of five, saying that the album has "intriguing musical arrangements and encouraging lyrics," and that listeners will "find a song that inspires their Christian walk and bring them closer to the Savior."

Johann Scheerer

Johann Wilhelm Karl Jakob Scheerer (6 November 1982 in Henstedt-Ulzburg) is a German musician and music producer based in Hamburg. He is known for his production of bands like Bosnian Rainbows, Peter Doherty, Omar Rodríguez-López, Faust or Gallon Drunk.
Biography.
Johann Scheerer was born on 6 November 1982 to Jan Philipp Reemtsma and Ann-Kathrin Scheerer in Henstedt-Ulzburg, and grew up in Hamburg.
At 16, he won a talent contest with his school band "Am kahlen Aste". The prize was a meeting with the then successful music producers, Berman Brothers (producers) (Caught in the Act, Hanson). This was followed by a recording contract with Epic/Sony and the release of three singles and an album under the band name Score!. The band was not as successful as the record company had hoped, and the contract came to an end. The band subsequently split up some two years later.
As a free agent, Johann Scheerer took recording the band into his own hands. This led to the creation of the "Rekordbox" recording studio in two construction containers stacked on top of each other, located on land occupied by the Garten Art Network in Hamburg’s Eifflerstrasse.
In 2004, he moved with Henning Schmidt (Plemo) into the recording studio "Phonraum" in the building formerly occupied by the Tageszeitung in Chemnitzstrasse in Hamburg. Following numerous smaller and demo productions, he and Schmidt parted ways. In 2006, he began collaborating with Thies Mynther, opening the completely analogue "Clouds Hill Recordings" studio in Hamburg. National and international productions soon followed and in 2008, Chris von Rautenkranz decided to join Clouds Hill Recordings with the mastering for Soundgarden.
Later in 2008, Scheerer created the "Taka-Takaz" project. Twelve of his songs were recorded with musicians Omar Rodriguez Lopez (At The Drive-In, The Mars Volta), Marco Haas (T.Raumschmiere), Jessica Drosten (Das Bierbeben), Thies Mynther (Phantom/Ghost, Stella), Bubi Blacksmith (Zed Yago), Mense Reents (Die Vögel), Stella, Sebastian Nagel (Mocambo/The Ape) and Albrecht Schrader. The songs were released as two 10” EPs, Leslie White and Leslie Black.
Together with his fellow band member, Sebastian Nagel, Scheerer founded the 7” label Clouds Hill Ltd. in 2009, initially releasing 7” singles, recorded in Clouds Hill Recordings Studio and limited to production runs of 500. After the release of the "Fukui" album for Hamburg band Stella, and "Beauty", from Freiburg band Kraków Loves Adana, the label established itself producing 10” EPs and 12” long players.
In 2010, Scheerer took "Clouds Hill Ltd." to the internationally based Roughtrade Distribution. In the autumn of 2010, the band Stella reached 7th place in the German Club Charts (Deutschen Clubcharts – DCC) with the 12” remix “Office &amp; Store”. The label received particular attention with its release of a 7” singles box, wrapped in sailcloth (2009), with a limited edition of 100, which sold out in less than 10 days and contained all the singles previously released by Clouds Hill Ltd. This was followed in 2011 by a 200 piece run of the “Analog Love in Digital Times” box, which included three 12” maxis and five 7” singles as well as a polaroid film and an original polaroid photo (in collaboration with Impossible).
The 2012 release of "…live at Clouds Hill"-Vinylbox sold out before its release, and featured seven artists who had played a concert at Clouds Hill Recordings. These included Faust &amp; Omar Rodríguez López, Gallon Drunk, Bosnian Rainbows, The Ape and Léonore Boulanger.
His 2012 productions included the debut album of Berlin artists ALLIE and the first album for Omar Rodríguez López’s new band Bosnian Rainbows, which was released in May 2013 by Clouds Hill. In this year Scheerer also was executive producer of the “Los chidos” Movie, a Rodríguez López Production in association with Sargent House.
In 2014, he met Peter Doherty, who asked him to produce his solo album, and who later summarised their working together simply with “the guy saved my life”. The Scheerer label Clouds Hill released a limited 12” single which included an exclusive song from Peter Doherty and James Johnston for Record Store Day 2016.
In 2017, Scheerer released the Peter Doherty solo album he had produced, “Hamburg Demonstrations” through his label "Clouds Hill", earning him a nomination for the Hamburg Music Prize “HANS” as best musician.
Philosophy.
In his productions, that range from pop to indie and on to avant-garde sound experiments, Scheerer strives for a sound that sets itself apart from the usual mainstream. He explains, “I always ask myself, what kind of mood, colour, depth do I want to create here? What kind of space do I want to see when I listen to this?”. His goal is to evoke emotions, without simply serving aesthetic expectations.

Rubrena gens

The gens Rubrena, probably the same as Rubrenia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are mentioned in the time of Juvenal, but very few appear in history. At least one obtained the consulship some time in the latter part of the third century AD, but little else is known of this family.
Origin.
The nomen "Rubrenus" seems to belong to a class of names derived from other gentilicia using the suffix "-enus" in place of "-inus", a Latin ending that would be more typical of cognomina. The name was most likely derived from "Rubrius", from "ruber", red or ruddy. The form "Rubrenius", found in one inscription, may be an error, or simply an attempt to give the name a more regular ending.
Branches and cognomina.
The only Rubrenus mentioned in ancient authors bore the surname "Lappa", a bur, belonging to a large class of cognomina derived from everyday objects, plants, and animals. The nomenclature of the consul Rubrenus, evidently inherited from a number of other families, included the common surnames "Priscus", elder, and "Proculus", an old praenomen, said by some of the Roman antiquarians to have been given to a child born while his father was abroad, but perhaps originally a diminutive of "Proca", a name known from Roman mythology as one of the Kings of Alba Longa. "Magianus", a surname derived from the Magia gens, seems to have been passed down among the Rubreni for several generations. Other surnames, including "Phorus" and "Hylas", were of Greek origin.

Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron &quot;Cacciatori di Calabria&quot;

The Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron ""Cacciatori di Calabria" () is a Carabinieri squadron (company-sized unit) based at the "Luigi Razza" Airbase, Vibo Valentia, Italy. The unit was established on 1 July 1991.
Carabinieri who are part of the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria" wear the red beret.
History.
The Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria"" traces its origins to the "squadrons" (), small Carabinieri patrols assigned to Aspromonte and Barbagia (in Sardinia) since 1970.
The name was chosen in reference to Garibaldi's "Cacciatori delle Alpi", being inspired by the guerilla warfare tactics employed by this unit.
During 2000s the squadron performed or contributed to several important fugitives' arrests and captures, such as Giuseppe Bellocco.
Mission.
The Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria" has the mission to support the territorial organization in patrolling Calabria's interior regions least accessible in search for important 'ndrangheta fugitives and rural law enforcement, by combining military and police techniques.
This unit supports the Carabinieri territorial units in the fight against organized crime on the Aspromonte ground, acting in symbiosis with helicopters and canine units. Unit's particularities include sudden and fast daytime and nocturnal infiltrations in the deep heart of the mountain bumps and ambushes carried out in difficult environmental conditions waiting to capture kidnappers or fugitives.
If necessary, the squadron provides support in rescue missions in natural disasters. For particular needs, the squadron may be deployed in other Regions or support Carabinieri territorial commands.
Squadrons of the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria" may be assigned to two different mission types: autonomous tasks and support tasks. The autonomous missions include investigations and information collections, cooperating with the relevant Carabinieri commands and stations. Support missions are preceded by an autonomous analysis, recognition and planification (together with the command requesting the support intervention). In all cases, however, the coordination between the Legion Command (regional-level) and the individual commands is constant and continuous.
Counter-terrorism.
As part of the Carabinieri counter-terrorist apparatus, the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron ""Cacciatori di Calabria" provides Emergency Intervention Detachments (); while Detachment operating in provincial capital cities depend on the relevant Provincial Command and focus their surveillance on sensitive places, Detachments of the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria"" operate both across the Calabria territory (with the exception of Reggio Calabria) and in other Regions.
In particular, Emergency Intervention Detachments of the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria" are focused on sensitive targets such as universities, national events or rallies, meetings and conventions.
Organization.
The Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron "Cacciatori di Calabria" depends on the Calabria Operational Group (established on 1 September 1992), headed by the deputy commander of the Calabria Carabinieri Legion. The squadron consists of 15 Teams framed into two Platoons.
Each Teams consists of specially trained Carabinieri: specialist climbers, patrolmen, marksmen, bomb disposal experts. One Team in one Platoon consists only of specialist rock climbers, while another Team in the other Platoon consists of alpine rescue-qualified specialist rock climbers.
Admission into the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron ""Cacciatori di Calabria" is upon demand and selection, conducted also by the 1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment "Tuscania""; training continues also after arriving in the squadron.
The unit is headquartered in the "Operational and Logistics Base", located in "Luigi Razza" Airbase, Vibo Valentia together with the 8th Helicopters Unit, the K-9 Unit, the Carabinieri Special Company (also dependent on the Calabria Operational Group), and the 14th Carabinieri Battalion "Calabria".
Uniform.
The Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron ""Cacciatori di Calabria", in addition to uniforms issued to all Carabinieri, wear an Operational Uniform, consisting og camouflage battle dress (together with 1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment "Tuscania"", Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment, and fellow "Cacciatori" Squadrons). Blue neckerchief, leather gloves and combat boots complete the look.

Presidential elections in South Korea

Presidential elections in South Korea determine who will serve as the President of South Korea for the next five years (formerly four, six, and seven).
Since the establishment of the First Republic in 1948, the presidential elections have taken place 20 times (19 excluding the March 1960 election whose results were invalidated after the April Revolution): in 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960 (in March and August), 1963, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017.
Prior to the Presidential Election Act of 1987, the elections were indirect. Since 1987, the president is elected directly by the public in a single round plurality vote (using the first-past-the-post simple plurality system) for a single, non-renewable five-year term.
Procedure (1987–present).
The presidential election rules are defined by the South Korean Constitution and the Public Official Election Act.
Election campaign.
The election campaign period, as set by the Election Law, is short – 23 days. According to the book "Internet Election Campaigns in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan", the election campaign periods in Korea (23 days for presidential elections and 14 days for National Assembly elections) were made intentionally short in order to "prevent excessive campaign spending for long-running election campaigns and harmful effects from overheated elections", but, on the downside, "this works against new candidates who are not well known".
Popular vote.
The president is elected by direct popular vote, It is conducted in a single round on a first-past-the-post basis.

Evgenavis (named after the Russian paleontologist Evgeny Kurochkin) is a genus of extinct basal bird that lived from the Barremian to the Aptian. The type specimen was an isolated tarsometatarsus found in Ilek Formation (Shestakovo locality), Western Siberia. "Evgenavis" may have been the only confuciusornithiform known outside the Jehol Biota, although there is also the possibility that it could have been a different type of avialan, such as an enantiornithean or a relative of "Vorona". A cladogram within a 2019 study involving a wide range of theropods included "Evgenavis" as a longipterygid.

Roller (April Wine song)

"Roller" is a rock song written by Myles Goodwyn and recorded by Canadian rock band April Wine for their 1978 studio album "First Glance". The song peaked at number 24 on the "RPM" 100 Singles chart in Canada and number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming their first American hit since 1972.
The song was instantly popular in North America, and helped April Wine regain international popularity, as it was their first hit song outside of Canada since 1972's "You Could Have Been a Lady", after a decade of success limited to Canada. "Roller" has remained a live staple and one of the band's most popular songs, and has become a staple of classic rock radio in Canada and the United States.
Background.
Myles Goodwyn, lead singer and main songwriter for April Wine, penned the song in 1976, though it wasn't recorded until 1978, and was decided to be released as a single from the album, becoming the album's biggest hit.
Content.
The term "roller" in the song is referring to a "high-roller" woman, an upper class traveler who is wealthy, and the narrator talks about leaving for Los Angeles to meet up with her.
"Roller" also talks about the narrator's unrequited love for this unnamed woman, in an upbeat, hard rock form similar to many other April Wine songs.
In popular culture.
"Roller" has been featured in several films, most notably "Joe Dirt" (2001), "Machine Gun Preacher" (2011), "Grown Ups 2", "The Heat" (both 2013), and "Game Night" (2018). It was used in several television shows as well, such as "Freaks and Geeks" season 1, episode 3, "Tricks and Treats"; the "Pilot" episode of "The Americans" in 2013, season 2, episode 6 "Take Me Away" of "Being Erica" in 2011; and the 2009 Canadian documentary "The Beat Goes On: Canadian Pop in the 1970s", which also included several other April Wine songs.

2018–19 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team

The 2018–19 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team represented the University of Virginia during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett in his tenth year, and played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.
UVA opened the season with consecutive wins over ranked Big Ten teams, No. 25 Wisconsin (Battle 4 Atlantis) and No. 24 Maryland (ACC–Big Ten Challenge), the latter of which improved Bennett's record in the Challenge to 8–2. An unheralded two-star recruit, 5'9" Kihei Clark from Los Angeles, California, started both games as a true freshman. The team then started the season 16–0 before falling to No. 1 Duke, 72–70. The game was just the fourth in college basketball history between two teams both ranked No. 1, as the No. 4 Cavaliers were voted atop the Coaches Poll before the loss. After a 16–2 ACC record, Virginia won a share of their fourth ACC regular season title in the past six years.
In the ACC tournament, the Cavaliers defeated NC State 76–56, before falling to Florida State in the conference semifinals. Virginia was then awarded the No. 1 seed in the South region and dispatched Gardner-Webb and Oklahoma by healthy margins in the first two rounds in Columbia, South Carolina. They advanced to a Sweet 16 matchup with Oregon and beat Oregon 53–49 to advance to their 2nd Elite 8 under Bennett. In the Elite Eight, they beat Purdue 80–75 in overtime to secure a trip to their first Final Four since 1984. On April 6, 2019, they defeated Auburn in their Final Four matchup by a score of 63–62 on 3 last-second free throws by Kyle Guy, cementing the program's first ever trip to the national championship game. On April 8, 2019, Virginia beat Texas Tech 85–77 in overtime, winning its first national championship.
Previous season.
Unranked by the AP in the preseason poll, the Cavaliers surprisingly finished the 2017–18 season 31–3, and 17–1 in ACC play to win both ACC Regular Season and tournament titles. The Cavaliers received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South region, where they were upset by No. 16 UMBC in the First Round. This was the first time in NCAA tournament history that a No. 1 seed was upset by a No. 16 seed.
Offseason.
Virginia's offseason started on the night of March 16, 2018, and ended on the evening of November 6, 2018. 
The Cavaliers lost five players and gained four.

Magnetic: The Game of Games is a 2003 video game developed by Australian studio Mulawa Dreaming. It was the second game by the studio after "Xiama". The game had a players only forum on its web site. "Magnetic Revisited" was a redesigned and rewritten version released in 2010. The game would be followed by "Magicama," and "Cooroora."
Development.
The game was conceived in September 2000. According to design documents which refer to relevant people by first name only, Michael was brought in to playtest the game, Ursula was Concept Tester; she played "Magnetic" as it developed and wrote to her friend June about her experiences, thereby offering the developer live feedback, Penny served as Chief Test Pilot, and Jake served as the artist; he interpreted the developer's prototype designs. It was expected to ship at the end of April 2003.
Plot and gameplay.
Players wander around a deserted island by navigating through a series of photos, encountering 16 games to play.
The six save slots are visualised by the player choosing one of six companions to accompany them.
The game comes on one CD.
Critical reception.
Mr. Bill's Adventureland found the developing narrative throughout the game to be a nice touch. Adventure Gamers felt that the title was impressive for the type of game it was going for. PibWeb noted the company's proficiency had improved since "Xiama". GamersHell felt the game was a "find" for those who didn't care about 3D graphics or professionally recorded soundtracks. GameBoomers thought the game stood well against other puzzle games like Pandora and Jewels. Tap Repeatedly felt the game was not very good entertainment. Just Adventure described the title as a worthy successor to "Xiama".
GameBoomers praised "Magnetic Revisited" due to its variation, entertainment, replayability, and addictive nature.

Melanie Johnston-Hollitt

Melanie Johnston-Hollitt (née Johnston; 8 September 1974) is an Australian astrophysicist and professor. She has worked on the design, construction, and international governance of several radio telescopes including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). She was the director of the Murchison Widefield Array until December 2020 and is a professor at the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. Since August 2020, Melanie Johnston-Hollitt is the director of the Curtin Institute for Computation.
Early life.
Johnston-Hollitt was born on 8 September 1974 in Darwin, Australia. She was born shortly before Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city after which she and her mother were evacuated to Brisbane on December 29, 1974 en route to Townsville. During her early life she lived in various parts of Queensland before her family returned to Darwin in 1979. In 1986 her family moved to Adelaide where she completed high school. Johnston-Hollitt attended the University of Adelaide, where she graduated with two degrees in theoretical and experimental physics and pure mathematics.
She also completed a BSc with honors in astrophysics under the supervision of Roger Clay, and a doctorate in radio astronomy jointly with the University of Adelaide and the CSIRO Australia Telescope National Facility under the supervision of Ron Ekers and Richard Hunstead.
Career.
Johnston-Hollitt moved to Leiden Observatory at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands as the inaugural LOFAR Fellow, joining the group of George Miley to work on the design of the LOFAR telescope. In 2004, she took up a continuing faculty position at the University of Tasmania. In January 2009 she moved to Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand to establish and lead a new radio astronomy group.
Johnston-Hollitt worked on NZ's engagement with the Square Kilometre Array, and she served in an advisory role for the New Zealand Government on the project from April 2009 to January 2018. Shortly after commencing her term advising the NZ Government, it was announced that NZ would join Australia in bidding to host the SKA telescope. Johnston-Hollitt was subsequently an author of the Australia-New Zealand bid to host the SKA, responsible for identifying possible SKA station sites in New Zealand. From 2011, she was a government-appointed member of the preparatory group set-up to establish the SKA, and then director for the SKA from December 2011 to January 2018.
For her scientific leadership she was appointed by the SKAO as founding co-chair of the SKA Cosmic Magnetism Science Working group in March 2013, and along with her co-chair, Federica Govoni, defined the early SKA requirements associated with cosmic magnetism, editing the magnetism sections of the SKA Science Case and writing the cosmic magnetism scientific summary paper.
Johnston-Hollitt led the 2011 bid for NZ to join the Murchison Widefield Array, a low frequency precursor to the SKA. She joined the MWA Board in 2012, became vice-chair in 2013, and held the position of chair from January 2014 to January 2018. In early 2017 she became founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Peripety Scientific, an independent research organisation specialising in radio astronomy research and consultancy based in Wellington. She resigned from Victoria University of Wellington in September 2017 and became a professor of Radio Astronomy at Curtin University and director of the Murchison Widefield Array. During her time as chair of the MWA board, Professor Johnston-Hollitt was responsible for the expansion of the MWA project to move from 11 research organisations over 3 countries with 112 individual researchers to 21 research organisations over 6 countries with 270 individual researchers. As MWA Director, she oversaw the third phase of the MWA project realised via the design and funding for the new 'MWAX correlator' - a GPU-based bespoke compute system. 
After finishing her 3 year term as MWA director in December 2020, Johnston-Hollitt continues to be the lead of the galactic and extragalactic science team in the Curtin Institute for Radio Astronomy, who are exploiting the MWA and other telescopes to uncover the mysteries of the Universe. Further, Professor Johnston-Hollitt has been appointed as the new Director of the Curtin Institute for Computation (CIC) in August 2020, leading a multi-disciplinary team of data scientists. The CIC is a cross-disciplinary research accelerator based on the use of high-performance computing.
Research career.
Johnston-Hollitt's primary research interests are cosmic magnetism and observations of galaxy clusters, primarily through the use of radio telescopes. She has authored over 230 publications. She has served on the Editorial Board of "Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia" since January 2015, commencing a 3-year term as Editor-in-Chief from January 2018.
Johnston-Hollitt has gained funding for design, construction and exploitation of radio telescopes across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. She has held several visiting positions as a guest professor at the Excellence Cluster Universe in Munich, Germany, the Sophia Antipolis University in Nice, France, the University of Bologna, Italy, and the University of Malaya.

Lopikerwaard

The Lopikerwaard is a polder landscape, located in the Dutch province of Utrecht.
History.
Originally an area of swampland, the polder was developed from the eleventh century CE. Many canals were dug in order to drain the land, dividing the land into equally sized plots which still define the landscape.
Geography.
The polder area is bounded by the Hollandse IJssel river to the north and north east, the Lek river to the south and the Krimpenerwaard polder to the west. Several larger drainage canals cross the polder from east to west. The area largely coincides with the municipality of Lopik, whence it gets its name. The landscape is defined by large areas of pasture lands and linear settlements.
Towns of the Lopikerwaard.
The cities of Oudewater, Montfoort and IJsselstein are located at the edges of the area.
Geology.
The Lopikerwaard soil consists mainly of a thick layer of peat the thins out towards the east. At the edges, near the rivers, clay deposits can be found.

Flendish Hundred

Flendish Hundred (more commonly Flendish) is a pre-Norman administrative division of the county of Cambridgeshire, England. The Hundreds of England were intermediate administrative divisions, larger than villages and smaller than shires, that survived until the 19th century. It was likely created in the early 10th century.
Flendish was first recorded in the Domesday Book and has had many names. In the 11th century Flendish hundred contained four vills, later divided into five parishes: Fulbourn, Teversham, Hinton, and Horningsea (today, Fen Ditton and Horningsea).
Fleam Dyke was probably the base from which the forces of King Edward the Elder began to ravage the lands of the East Anglian Danes in 903. These campaigns ended by 920 with his subjugation of the southern Danelaw. [Ref. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, ed. D. Whitelock (1961), p. 59]
Today its name lives on as Fleam Dyke
Alternative Spellings.
Before English spelling was formalised, the spelling varied considerably showing the Germanic, Norse and Flemish cultural influences of East Anglia before the time when English was declared England's language by Edward III.

Cohn's theorem

In mathematics, Cohn's theorem states that a "n"th-degree self-inversive polynomial formula_1 has as many roots in the open unit disk formula_2 as the reciprocal polynomial of its derivative. Cohn's theorem is useful for studying the distribution of the roots of self-inversive and self-reciprocal polynomials in the complex plane.
An "n"th-degree polynomial,
is called self-inversive if there exists a "fixed" complex number ( formula_4 ) of modulus 1 so that,
where
is the reciprocal polynomial associated with formula_1 and the bar means complex conjugation. Self-inversive polynomials have many interesting properties. For instance, its roots are all symmetric with respect to the unit circle and a polynomial whose roots are all on the unit circle is necessarily self-inversive. The coefficients of self-inversive polynomials satisfy the relations.
In the case where formula_9 a "self-inversive polynomial" becomes a "complex-reciprocal polynomial" (also known as a "self-conjugate polynomial"). If its coefficients are real then it becomes a "real self-reciprocal polynomial".
The "formal derivative" of formula_1 is a ("n" − 1)th-degree polynomial given by
Therefore, Cohn's theorem states that both formula_1 and the polynomial
have the same number of roots in formula_14

Thickness-to-chord ratio

In aeronautics, the thickness-to-chord ratio, sometimes simply chord ratio or thickness ratio, compares the maximum vertical thickness of a wing to its chord. It is a key measure of the performance of a wing planform when it is operating at transonic speeds.
At speeds approaching the speed of sound, the effects of Bernoulli's principle over curves on the wing and fuselage can accelerate the local flow to supersonic speeds. This creates a shock wave that produces a powerful form of drag known as wave drag, and gives rise to the concept of the sound barrier. The speed at which these shocks first form, critical mach, is a function of the amount of curvature. In order to reduce wave drag, wings should have the minimum curvature possible while still generating the required amount of lift.
The natural outcome of this requirement is a wing design that is thin and wide, which has a low thickness-to-chord ratio. At lower speeds, undesirable parasitic drag is largely a function of the total surface area, which suggests using a wing with minimum chord, leading to the high aspect ratios seen on light aircraft and regional airliners. Such designs naturally have high thickness-to-chord ratios. Designing an aircraft that operates across a wide range of speeds, like a modern airliner, requires these competing needs to be carefully balanced for every aircraft design.
Swept wings are a practical outcome of the desire to have a low thickness-to-chord ratio at high speeds and a lower one at lower speeds during takeoff and landing. The sweep stretches the chord as seen by the airflow, while still keeping the wetted area of the wing to a minimum. For practical reasons, wings tend to be thickest at the root, where they meet the fuselage. For this reason, it is common for wings to taper their chord towards the tips, keeping the thickness-to-chord ratio close to constant, this also reduces induced drag at lower speeds. The crescent wing is another solution to the design to keep a relatively constant thickness-to-chord ratio.

Molo San Vincenzo Lighthouse

Molo San Vincenzo Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located at the end of the western side to the entrance of the Port of Naples, Campania on the Tyrrhenian Sea.
History.
The first lighthouse was built in 1487 under the reign of Ferdinand I of Naples on plan of Luca Bengiamo and was called Torre San Vincenzo, however the lighthouse was damaged in 1495 in the clashes between the Aragonese and the French and rebuilt under Frederick of Naples. In 1624 the lantern was destroyed by fire and the reconstruction, attributed to Pietro De Marino, was completed in 1626. In 1843 a lighthouse, high, was built on the Molo Beverello and in 1933 it was destroyed in order to enlarge the harbour.
Description.
The current lighthouse was activated in 1916 and consists of a red masonry cylindrical tower, high, with balcony and lantern, mounted on a stone square prism block base. The tower is characterized by three windows framed in white. The lantern, painted in white and the dome in grey metallic, is positioned at above sea level and emits three white flashes in a 15 seconds period, visible up to a distance of . The lighthouse is completely automated and is operated by the Marina Militare with the identification code number 2424 E.F.

Inter praecipuas apostolici ministerii () was a papal bull issued by Pope Clement XII, on 17 December 1737, establishing that whoever was appointed Patriarch of Lisbon was to be elevated to the rank of cardinal in the next consistory. Lisbon remains the only episcopal see accorded this distinction. Others like the Patriarch of Venice are made cardinals in the consistory following his appointment, but only by tradition.

Aplochlora vivilaca

Aplochlora vivilaca is a moth of the family Geometridae first described by Francis Walker in 1861. It is found in Sri Lanka, Indian subregion, Taiwan, Borneo and Sulawesi.
The male has bipectinate (comb-like on both sides) antennae. Its wings are greenish, which can lead to confusion with some members of Geometrinae. There is a black spot found closer to each cell in each wing. On the caterpillar the cylindrical and ground color ranges from greenish to apple green with oily surfaces. Segmental margins are yellow. Thoracic segments are purplish. Host plants of the caterpillar are "Casearia" and "Holoptelea".

Maxime Moses Alexandre

Maxime Moses Alexandre (1899-1976) was a French poet associated with Surrealism.
Life.
Maxime Alexandre was born into a liberal Jewish family in Wolfisheim. There his first language was German, although his family moved to Lausanne during World War I. There he learnt French, and was introduced to Romain Rolland by René Schickelé.
Alexandre was active in the surrealist movement from its inception in 1924 until 1929, when he followed Louis Aragon out of the group. He contributed to both "La Révolution surréaliste" and "Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution". A Communist, he also worked for the French Communist Party newspaper "L'Humanité". He was imprisoned when World War II started.
In 1949 Alexandre converted to Roman Catholicism, though he later left the church in reaction to what he felt was the church's anti-Semitism.

Carlota Smith (May 21, 1934, New York City-May 24, 2007, Austin, Texas) was an American linguist. She was professor of linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin for 38 years.
Smith received her M.A. (1964) and Ph.D. (1967) in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, studying under Zellig Harris. In 1969, she joined the faculty of the Department of Linguistics at University of Texas at Austin, where she served for the remainder of her life. She was department chair from 1981-1985. She was named the Dallas TACA Centennial Professor in the Humanities in 1991.
During her long career, she made important contributions to three areas of linguistic research. Her early work examined English syntax and child language acquisition. (Shipley et al. 1969 was an influential paper in this area.) She wrote a number of papers and a widely cited book (Smith 1991) on grammatical aspect. A final research interest involved the analysis of discourse units above the level of the sentence, which she categorizes, in Smith (2003) into five ‘discourse modes’ (narrative, report, description, information, and argument).
She spent many years doing linguistic research on Navajo and became a member of the Navajo Language Academy.

Pusher syndrome

Pusher syndrome is a condition observed in some people following a stroke which has left them with one side weakened due to hemiparesis. Sufferers exhibit a tendency to actively push away from the unweakened side, thus leading to a loss of postural balance. It can be a result of left or right brain damage. In contrast to most stroke patients, who typically prefer more weight-bearing on their non-hemiparetic side, this abnormal condition can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance. The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior thalamus on either side, or multiple areas of the right cerebral hemisphere.
Signs and symptoms.
In people with acute stroke and hemiparesis, the disorder is present in 10.4% of patients. Rehabilitation may take longer in patients that display pusher behaviour. The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients that presented with ipsilateral pushing used 3.6 weeks more to reach the same functional outcome level on the Barthel Index, than did patients without ipsilateral pushing.
Pushing behavior has shown that perception of body posture in relation to gravity is altered. Patients experience their body as oriented "upright" when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion. In addition, patients seem to show no disturbed processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining subjective visual vertical. In sitting, the push presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side and in standing, creates a highly unstable situation as the patient is unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy to correct their altered perception of vertical.
Pusher syndrome is sometimes confused with and used interchangeably as the term hemispatial neglect, and some previous theories suggest that neglect leads to pusher syndrome. However, another study had observed that pusher syndrome is also present in patients with left hemisphere lesions, leading to aphasia, providing a stark contrast to what was previously believed regarding hemispatial neglect, which mostly occurs with a right hemisphere lesion.
Karnath summarizes these two conflicting views, as they conclude that both neglect and aphasia are highly correlated with pusher syndrome possibly due to the close proximity of relevant brain structures associated with these two respective syndromes. However, the article goes on to state that it is imperative to note that both neglect and aphasia are not the underlying causes of pusher syndrome.
Cause.
The underlying pathology is thought to affect the posterior thalamus which is the fundamental brain structure that controls body upright posture.
Pathophysiology.
With a diagnosis of pusher behaviour, three important variables should be seen, the most obvious of which is spontaneous body posture of a longitudinal tilt of the torso toward the paretic side of the body occurring on a regular basis and not only on occasion. The use of the nonparetic extremities to create the pathological lateral tilt of the body axis is another sign to be noted when diagnosing for pusher behaviour. This includes abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side. The third variable that is seen is that attempts of the therapist to correct the pusher posture by aiming to realign them to upright posture are resisted by the patient.
Treatment.
Physical therapists focus on motor learning strategies when treating these patients. Verbal cues, consistent feedback, practicing correct orientation and weight shifting are all effective strategies used to reduce the effects of this disorder. Having a patient sit with their stronger side next to a wall and instructing them to lean towards the wall is an example of a possible treatment for pusher behaviour.
A new physical therapy approach for patients with pusher syndrome suggests that the visual control of vertical upright orientation, which is undisturbed in these patients, is the central element of intervention in treatment. In sequential order, treatment is designed for patients to realize their altered perception of vertical, use visual aids for feedback about body orientation, learn the movements necessary to reach proper vertical position, and maintain vertical body position while performing other activities.
History.
It was first described by Patricia Davis in 1985.

Redimiculum Matellarum

Redimiculum Matellarum (the title means 'A necklace of chamberpots') was the first collection of poetry published by Basil Bunting.
Publication.
The pamphlet collection, privately printed in Milan in 1930, included 13 poems written between 1925 and 1929. Priced at 'Half a Crown or Twelve Lire', it had been subsidized by Margaret de Silver, widow of a wealthy American businessman, whose help Bunting acknowledged in the preface:
Bunting's poem 'Villon' was followed by two sections of shorter poems: 'Carmina' (containing 'Weeping oaks grieve', I am agog for foam', 'Against the tricks of time', 'After the grimaces of capitulation', 'Narciss, my numerous cancellations prefer' and 'Empty vast days') and 'Etcetera' (containing 'An arles, an arles for my hiring', 'Loud intolerant bells', 'Dear be still', 'Chorus of Furies (overheard)', 'Darling of Gods and Men' and 'As to my heart'.
Reception.
Though "Redimiculum Matellarum" went "virtually unnoticed", it did receive a review by Louis Zukofsky in "Poetry". Ezra Pound also paid tribute to the collection in Canto LXXIV as "'Redimiculum Matellorum' / privately printed / to the shame of various critics".

Ornithoteuthis volatilis

Ornithoteuthis volatilis, the shiny bird squid, is a squid from the subfamily Ommastrephinae, the flying squids, of the family Ommastrephidae part of the pelagic squid order Oegopsida. It is a tropical and sub-tropical species which is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific oceans. It is slightly larger than the closely related species "Ornithoteuthis antillarum" of the Atlantic Ocean.
Description.
"Ornithoteuthis volatilis" has a broad head and it has a very narrow muscular mantle which tapers into a long pointed tail, the head is markedly wider than the mantle. It has long fins which are arrow-shaped and sharply lanceolate towards the tail with the rear edges of the fins being concave. The length of the fins is equal to approximately 55% of the mantle length and the fin width is circa 47% of the mantle length. The first to third arms have at least 50 suckers each while each fourth arm has 75, with the suckers on the second and third arms being larger than those on the first and fourth arms. The suckers near the base have severely closely set teeth, of which the middle 1-3 are much more slender and sharply pointed. The largest suckers have 10-14 teeth all of which are sharply pointed and closely set, with long teeth and short teeth set alternately and with the 2 or 3 lowest (i.e. ventral) on either side being the widest and being obliquely pointed. The suckers towards the tip have less than 7 teeth which are separated, slender triangular and sharply pointed except ventral-most on either side which has a wider and less quadrangular shape.
Males have a hectocotylus on the fourth right arm. The basal two thirds of this arm have 14 large, basal suckers followed by 20 reduced suckers with the ventral series is much reduced and some of these suckers are not true suckers but have a nipple like form. The outer third of the arm has 25 pairs of suckers which have their bases swollen into transverse, membranous papillae. These are closely set in two series, the ventral series is comb-like with much smaller rudimentary suckers on tips of papillae, separated by a membranous ridge along middle line. The dorsal protective membrane is absent from the tip of the arm while on the ventral side the protective membrane is normal in basal third of the arm then it broadens and becomes very thick. There is a "honeycomb region" which has 14 pores and a number of grooves and ridges. The pores are arranged in longitudinal series, each having two grooves across them which extend towards the membrane margin, the ridges lie opposite the grooves and connect with one another, where they are edged with numerous small, roundish depressions.
The tentacular clubs are around half of the length of the tentacles, they have 12 suckers in the carpal region each of which has 8–12 conical teeth set on its distal margin with more closely set, broader, more triangular and more oblique teeth set on the proximal margin. The manus has four series of suckers each with 7-9 suckers of which the central two series are much larger; the largest being around 3 times larger than the marginal suckers. These large suckers are wide and deep while the other club suckers are broader than they are deep. The inner margin of the large manus suckers is completely toothed with sharply pointed, slightly curved teeth which alternate with small, plate-like, semicircular teeth, although these teeth are almost absent in the largest suckers. The rings of the suckers on the margins of the club and the dactylus have the sharp, pointed teeth on the proximal margin but these are broader, oblique, triangular and more closely set than similar teeth in the large suckers, the teeth on the distal margin are slender, conical and separated. There are four series of suckers on the dactylus arranged in 27 transverse rows with the dorsal suckers being smaller than those in more ventral sitings. There is a carpal locking apparatus which has 1 or 2 low knobs, no smooth-ringed suckers; this apparatus is rather indistinct in some individuals.
Photophores are distributed in a similar way to "O. antillarum", i.e. there are three visceral photophores, an oval, anal photophore, a posterior intestinal photophore and an elongated posterior visceral photophore which forms a strip of pinkish bioluminescent tissue extending from the small photophore to the posterior tip of the mantle cavity. The maximnmim reported size is 250mm mantle length for females and 310mm for males.
Distribution.
"Ornithoteuthis volatilis" is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Its latitudinal range in the western Pacific lies between 36°N to 38°S and it extends as far east as the Line Islands, while in the Indian Ocean it ranges from the Arabian Sea south to Madagascar and east to the Timor Sea, south to the waters off eastern Australia. It has been recorded in the Atlantic Ocean off Namibia.
Habitat and biology.
"Ornithoteuthis volatilis" inhabits tropical slopes and oceanic waters where the adults range from the surface waters at night to moderate depths. They occur near the botton in the bathyal zone but in midwater above the continental slope and above sea mounts and ridges. The paralarvae and juveniles can also be found in midwater above great depths at the equator.
It has very small eggs less than 1mm in diameter and spawning is intermittent with several egg masses laid over an extended period. The spermatophores of mature males have a length equivalent to 10.3% of mantle length and the number of spermatophores is around 100 as the male matures the volume of the Needham's sac and of the seminal reservoirs of the spermatophores increases. "O. volatilis" is a nerito-oceanic species which lives near or over slopes; the non adults are found in midwater in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones above the tops and slopes of sea mounts and midocean ridges as well as over the continental slopes and oceanic depths. They spawn near the sea bed near sea mounts and mid ocean ridges, and they may make long migrations to these areas. off eastern Australia spawning takes place in the deeper shelf and upper continental slope waters that sit within the warm East Australian Current which originates in the tropics, the size distribution of paralarvae and adults suggests that spawning in occurs throughout the year in this area. In the northern South China Sea spawning runs is from June through to October. In the western
North Pacific Ocean this species spawns in the summer and its paralarvae are found in the Kuroshio Current off Japan.
"O. volatilis" is an actively browsing predator which preys on many different, relatively small animals. Its predators include numerous species of tropical and subtropical pelagic fish such as yellowfin tuna ("Thunnus albacares"), longnose lancetfish ("Alepisaurus ferox"), dolphinfish ("Coryphaena hyppurus") and swordfish ("Xiphias gladius"). Sperm whales hunt this species extensively and it is heavily preyed on by the South African fur seal ("Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus"). It is also an important food item for several shark species including the tiger shark ("Galeocerdo cuvier"), the scalloped hammerhead shark ("Syphrna lewini") and the smooth hammerhead shark ("Syphrna zygaena"). They are capable of short glides in a similar manner to flying fish.

6th Army (RSFSR)

The 6th Army was a field army of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War, which was formed twice. 
First Formation.
The 6th Army was formed on 11 September 1918 in the region of the Arkhangelsk, Kotlas and Vyatsky districts. The headquarters were located in Vologda (September 1918 - February 1920) and later Arkhangelsk (March - April 1920).&lt;br&gt;
It was part of the Northern Front which fought against Entente troops and the White Northern Army which were based in Archangelsk and Murmansk.
In September-October 1918, the Sixth Army operated on the routes leading from Arkhangelsk to Vologda and the Northern Dvina to Kotlas and Vyatka, preventing the unification of anti-Soviet forces operating in the European North and those under command of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia. In January 1919, the Sixth Army fought the Battle of Shenkursk and in April-November 1919, tried to liberate the railway line Vologda-Arkhangelsk, the Pechora River, Northern Dvina River Pinega River and Mezen River.
After the withdrawal of the British and US Troops from Northern Russia in October 1919, the defeat of the White Northern Army and the conquest of Archangelsk and Murmansk in February and March 1920, the 6th Army was disbanded on 10 April 1920. The troops were transferred to the 7th Army.

Second Formation.
The 6th Army was formed a second time on 19 August 1920. The army was included in the newly formed Southern Front against General Wrangel. The headquarters were located in Kremenchuk (September), Berislav (September - November), Chaplynka (November) and Kherson (December 1920 - May 1921).
In September-October 1920, the 6th Army fought defensively, holding the Kakhovka bridgehead and stopping the White forces' attempts to force the Dnieper. It also supported the 2nd Cavalry Army in defeating the Zadneprovsky group of Wrangel's forces. During the counter-offensive of the Southern Front in Northern Tavria, the army occupied Perekop and facilitated the advance of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry armies.
In the Siege of Perekop (1920) (November 7-17, 1920), the 6th Army inflicted the main blow on the night of November 8, in crossing the Syvash and capturing the Perekop Isthmus. After the end of the hostilities in the Crimea, the 6th Army protected the Black Sea coast and fought against rebels in the Kherson and Odessa provinces.
On May 13, 1921 the 6th Army was disbanded and the administration and troops were transferred to the Kharkov Military District.

Hip Priest and Kamerads

Hip Priest and Kamerads is a 1985 compilation album by British rock band The Fall, containing tracks taken from their releases on the Kamera label together with a previously-unreleased live track from the same era. It was subsequently reissued with a further four live tracks added.
Content.
By 1985, the band's releases on the Kamera label were hard to find and fetching high prices among collectors. Situation Two released this compilation containing all four tracks from the singles released on the label ("Lie-Dream of a Casino Soul"/"Fantastic Life" and "Look, Know"/"I'm into C.B.!"), together with songs from "Hex Enduction Hour" and "Room to Live", one a live version.
The versions of "The Classical", "Fortress", and "Hip Priest" are the album versions from "Hex Enduction Hour", and "Room to Live" and "Hard Life in Country" are from "Room to Live". "Mere Pseud Mag. Ed." is a live version recorded in St. Gallen in 1983, and at five minutes and 42 seconds is twice as long as the album version on "Hex".
The album was originally released in March 1985 on vinyl only.
Reissues.
"Hip Priest and Kamerads" was first released on CD and cassette in 1988 by Situation Two, with four added live tracks; "Jawbone and the Air-Rifle" was recorded in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1981, "Just Step Sideways" in Brighton in 1982, and "Who Makes The Nazis?" and (the over 15 minutes long version of) "And This Day" at the Hammersmith Palais in 1982. This 14-track running order was maintained on a subsequent CD release in 1995 on Beggars Banquet. The 10-track vinyl version was reissued by Beggars Banquet in Greece in 1985 and by Situation Two in 1990.
Reception.
Reviews from the time of the album's release in both the "Melody Maker" and the "NME" were favourable. "Melody Maker"'s Colin Irwin called it "a pretty satisfying documentary of the period", going on to say "all angles are covered in this profile of Britain's most perverse, jarring and—dammit—"entertaining" band" and calling the tracks "timeless wonders". Cath Carroll', in her "NME" review, called the compilation "smartly selected and connected".
Retrospective reviews were also positive. "Trouser Press" described it as "a good introduction for the uninitiated". Ned Raggett, reviewing the album for AllMusic, gave it four stars, viewing the song selection as "nearly impeccable". It received three and half stars from "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide", and an 8/10 rating from the "SPIN Alternative Record Guide". The "Chicago Tribune", however, described the material on the album as "not among the Fall's most accessible".
Charts.
"Hip Priest and Kamerads" peaked at number 4 in the UK Independent Albums Chart, spending a total of nine weeks on the chart in 1985.

Takovo Meeting

The Takovo Meeting () was the gathering of Serbian leaders held on (Palm Sunday) at Takovo, a village near present-day Gornji Milanovac. Two years following the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising, the decision was made to start a new uprising against the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of Miloš Obrenović. The meeting was held on the day of the traditional people's gathering, to which people from many Serbian regions attended. Preparations were kept in strict secrecy, with agitation limited to territories of Rudnik, Kragujevac and Čačak nahias. The idea of a new uprising was met with broad support among the masses.
However, the Serbs, disgruntled by Turkish oppression, did not wait for 11 April. Attacks on Turkish detachments and officials began already on 8 April 1815. The Takovo Meeting was the beginning of the Second Serbian Uprising.
