Bangladeshi cricket team in New Zealand in 2018–19

The Bangladesh cricket team toured New Zealand in February and March 2019 to play three Tests and three One Day Internationals (ODIs). The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The tour ended early, with the cancellation of the third and final Test match, following the Christchurch mosque shootings.
The tour started two day after the conclusion of the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League, with Bangladesh's coach Steve Rhodes saying that it is "far from ideal preparation". Conversely, Bangladesh's wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim said it would be ideal preparation ahead of the World Cup, with New Zealand having conditions similar to those in England.
New Zealand won the ODI series 3–0, their fourth-consecutive whitewash in a bilateral ODI series at home against Bangladesh. Ross Taylor became New Zealand's leading run-scorer in One Day International cricket, after he surpassed Stephen Fleming's career total in the third ODI.
Ahead of the tour to New Zealand, Bangladesh's Test captain Shakib Al Hasan suffered a hand injury. Mahmudullah was named as the captain of Bangladesh's team for the first and second Tests. Shakib was eventually ruled out of the third Test. Kane Williamson was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the third and final Test, with Tim Southee named as captain in his place.
However, the third Test was called off a day before the scheduled start of the match of 15 March 2019, due to the Christchurch mosque shootings. The Bangladesh team were on their way to one of the mosques in Christchurch for Friday prayers, but the team were able to escape to Hagley Oval. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) later confirmed that the team was safe and back at their hotel. New Zealand had won the first two Test matches to win the series 2–0.
Squads.
Ahead of the tour, Taskin Ahmed was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to injury. Shafiul Islam and Ebadot Hossain replaced him in Bangladesh's ODI and Test squads respectively. Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out of Bangladesh's ODI squad, after fracturing a finger in the final of the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League. Kane Williamson was selected for the first two ODIs in New Zealand's squad, with Colin Munro replacing him in the team for the third ODI, and Tom Latham leading the squad.
After the conclusion of the third ODI, Soumya Sarkar was added to Bangladesh's Test squad as cover for Shakib Al Hasan. Ahead of the third Test, Tom Blundell was added to New Zealand's squad, as cover for BJ Watling. Kane Williamson was ruled out of New Zealand's squad for the third Test, with Will Young added to the squad as his replacement.

Sri Lankan cricket team in South Africa in 2018–19

The Sri Lanka cricket team toured South Africa in February and March 2019 to play two Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
In February 2019, Sri Lanka named Dimuth Karunaratne as the captain of their Test side, after Dinesh Chandimal was dropped due to poor form. Chandimal was also omitted from Sri Lanka's ODI squad for the tour. Sri Lanka won the Test series 2–0, their first Test series win in South Africa. It was also the first time that a team from Asia had won a Test series in South Africa.
South Africa won the ODI series 5–0. It was the fourth time in less than two years that Sri Lanka had been whitewashed in a five-match ODI series. For the T20I series, Faf du Plessis was named as South Africa's captain for the first match, with JP Duminy named as captain for the remaining two fixtures. South Africa also completed a whitewash in the T20I series, winning 3–0.
Squads.
Ahead of the last two ODIs, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla and JP Duminy were added to South Africa's squad, with Reeza Hendricks and Wiaan Mulder being dropped. However, the day after Amla was added to South Africa's ODI squad, he took compassionate leave, missing the last two matches, with Hendricks recalled. Kusal Perera was ruled out of Sri Lanka's ODI squad for the final two ODIs, after suffering a hamstring injury in the third ODI. Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Nortje were ruled out of South Africa's T20I squad for the final two T20Is due to injury. Junior Dala was added to South Africa's squad for the third T20I.

Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Jaro

Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Jaro (English: Our Lady of the Candles; formally: Nuestra Señora de la Purificación y la Candelaria) is a Marian title and image venerated by Filipino Catholics. The image, which is enshrined on the balcony of Jaro Cathedral, is known as the patroness of Jaro District of Iloilo City and the whole of Western Visayas.
The devotion to Candelaria of Jaro is derived from the original Virgin of Candelaria (Our Lady of Candles) enshrined in the Basilica of Candelaria in Canarias, Spain.
The feast day of Our Lady of the Candles is on Candlemas (2 February), and is celebrated in Iloilo City with a Solemn Pontifical Mass presided by the Archbishop of Jaro. It is the largest Roman Catholic Marian festival outside of Luzon after the Peñafrancia of Naga, Camarines Sur.
Pope John Paul II personally performed a canonical coronation of the venerated image on 21 February 1981, thereby making it as the first Marian image in Asia crowned by a pontiff in personam (by a papal saint).
Description.
The title commemorates Mary's ritual purification during the Presentation of Jesus. "Halakha" (Jewish law) ordered that firstborn sons be redeemed at the Temple in Jerusalem when they were 40 days old. The mother, who expelled blood during the birth, was considered unclean for a week and 33 days thereafter, necessitating her purification at the same time the child is redeemed. Even though in Catholic doctrine, Mary herself was considered sinless ever since her Concepcion due to the merits of Christ. This, according to the theological treatises of Blessed Ramon Llull, the original author who wrote of the doctrine of "The Immaculate Concepcion". He was an ardent admirer as well as a staunch critic of Islamic thinkers: Al-Farabi, Avicenna and Ibn Sab'in. The Virgin Mary was pure and virginal: before, during and after Christ's birth, and has no need for "ritual purification" but due to her humility participated in the ritual anyway and by her humility showed the way for the purification of the whole of mankind.
The limestone statue discovered in the 16th-century was miraculously lifted up by fishermen who discovered its weight changed from something unable to be carried to one which was able to, when the Bishop declared that it should be placed on the Jaro church. It was also once found floating in the Iloilo River, something fascinating since stone statues don't usually float. It depicts Mary and the Child Jesus carrying tapers in their right hands a symbol of light and purification. It is customarily vested in gold cloth; crowns adorn mother and son, the latter holding a "globus cruciger" in his left hand symbolizing Christ's reign over the whole earth. The candle held by the cathedral's holy image is today tipped with a red electrical bulb.
History.
Tradition recounts the statue's first appearance in 1587, when a group of fishermen found it floating in the Iloilo River. The fishermen initially could not lift the image due to its weight, but when they decided to bring it to Jaro, the image suddenly became easier to carry. The statue was initially placed in a small niche near the apex of the local church's central spire. Folklore speaks of the statue's growth in size over the centuries, to the point that it was transferred to the balcony. The image's shrine is accessible today by a flight of steps attached to the cathedral's northeastern façade.
The statue was declared patroness of the Western Visayas by Pope John Paul II who, in person, canonically crowned this image on 21 February 1981, during his first Apostolic Visit to the Philippines. It is thus the only Marian statue in the Philippines personally crowned by the Pontiff instead of a proxy legate.
National Shrine.
Pope Pius IX authorised the canonical erection of the Diocese of Jaro on 25 May 1865. Bishop Mariano Cuartero took possession of the diocese in 1868, and later partitioned it into nine dioceses. In 1874, Cuartero had the cathedral built on the site, dedicating it to Elizabeth of Hungary.
The original edifice was among the many structures destroyed in the Lady Caycay earthquake, an 8.2 surface wave magnitude tremor which struck Panay Island on 25 January 1948. Pope Pius XII elevated Jaro to an archdiocese on 29 June 1951 via a papal bull, and the cathedral was fully restored by 1956 under José María Cuenco, the first Archbishop of Jaro.
In January 2012, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines approved "National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles" as an additional title for the cathedral.
Confraternity.
The "Cofradia de la Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria" is the shrine's lay confraternity recognized by the Archdiocese of Jaro.

Ross Parry

Ross Parry News Agency is a national and international news agency based in Yorkshire. The company is owned by South West News Service. 
History.
Ross Parry started life as an independent news agency based in Leeds, West Yorkshire, which was founded in 1981 by partners Jeff Ross and Dave Parry. It turned into an agency with great "calibre and reputation" in providing the national press with news stories and pictures.
In 2013, Ross Parry News Agency was acquired by SWNS along with Masons News in Cambridge. Parry chose to stay on as picture editor and as part of the takeover bid the news agency would keep its originally name. Parry said the union with SWNS "would take Ross Parry to a new level, providing an even better service from our region."
After Parry retired a year later, Glen Minikin took over the reins as picture editor. In Summer 2017, Charlotte Owen became news editor after taking over from Rebecca Penston.
In late 2017, SWNS announced Ross Parry would be part of their new dawn of content creating, which would "revolutionise" the industry. The company won a six-figure Google grant to help the content making process.
Present Day.
In 2018, Ross Parry's chief reporter Tom Kershaw, along with two other journalists, overturned an order to name a police officer after he was struck off for not reviewing CCTV footage correctly.

Clarence G. Child

Clarence Griffin Child (March 22, 1864 – September 20, 1948) was an American educator, scholar of medieval literature, and hobbyist mathematician who served as dean of the graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania.
Early life and education.
Born in Newport, Rhode Island, to Rev. William Spencer Child and Jessie Isabella Davis, Child received his undergraduate education at Trinity College, Connecticut, where he was initiated into Psi Upsilon and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He went on to complete a master's degree at Trinity, remaining there briefly afterwards to teach mathematics, which was his long-time hobby. He subsequently studied at the University of Munich and Johns Hopkins University, receiving his Ph.D. from the latter university where his dissertation focused on the use of palatal sounds in Old English.
Career.
In 1896 Child was appointed an instructor in English at the University of Pennsylvania and, from 1904 to 1907, served as dean of Pennsylvania's graduate school.

Second Oli cabinet

The Second Oli cabinet was the Government of Nepal from 15 February 2018 to 13 July 2021. It was initially formed as a majority coalition on 15 February 2018, after Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli was elected as the new Prime Minister of Nepal following the 2017 general election. Oli's candidacy was supported by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre). He assumed his office along with two ministers with the remaining ministers added at later points. The CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew its support from the government in May 2021, reducing it to a minority, and after the dissolution of the House of Representatives, it turned into an interim government. The second Oli cabinet was replaced by the fifth Deuba cabinet, formed after the Supreme Court ordered the appointment of Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister under in accordance with Article 76 (5) of the Constitution of Nepal.
Despite the naming suggesting otherwise, the cabinet is not the extension of the first Oli cabinet, as two different cabinets were formed by two different prime ministers in between both Oli cabinets. Apart from prime minister Oli, only four other ministers served in both cabinets; Giriraj Mani Pokharel and Shakti Bahadur Basnet, who joined the cabinet in the beginning, and Bishnu Prasad Paudel and Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who were added to the cabinet in a later rearrangement. Pokharel headed the Ministry of Education while Paudel headed the Ministry of Finance both times, whereas Basnet and Rayamajhi served in two different ministries in the two cabinets.
History.
The Constitution of Nepal set the maximum numbers of ministers including state ministers to 25, however, Oli first decided to have 17 ministries under him, which is less than the previous cabinets with each around 30 ministries. It was later expanded to 22 ministries and the addition of three state ministers brought the number of cabinet members to 25.
The first expansion to the cabinet was made on 26 February 2018, when seven more ministers were sworn in, while the second expansion took place on 16 March 2018.
On 11 March 2018, Oli won a motion of confidence with 208 out of 268 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives.
On 17 May 2018, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) merged to form the Nepal Communist Party, giving the Oli government a majority in both houses of the federal parliament. On 28 May 2018, the Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal, which would later merge into Samajbadi Party, Nepal on 6 May 2019, joined the government. Samajbadi Party, Nepal left the government on 24 December 2019.
Further major cabinet reshuffles took place on 20 November 2019 and 14 October 2020.
A major ministerial reshuffle took place on 25 December 2020 after several ministers resigned in protest of Oli's move to recommend the dissolution of the House of Representatives which was promptly approved by the president, although it was later overturned by the Supreme Court. All members of the cabinet were members of the Nepal Communist Party until 7 March 2021, when the party was dissolved by a verdict of the Supreme Court. The court's verdict invalidated the ruling party, effectively reviving the former CPN (UML) and CPN (Maoist Centre) parties. This reduced Oli's government back to a coalition government. The CPN (Maoist Centre) recalled its ministers on 13 March 2021 and withdrew its support from the government on 5 May 2021, effectively turning it into a minority government. After Oli failed to obtain a vote of confidence in the parliament, his government was reduced to a caretaker capacity.
Third term.
Oli was appointed prime minister for a third time on 13 May 2021 by president Bidya Devi Bhandari, albeit as a minority prime minister, as none of the opposition parties were able to form a majority government or lay their claim for it in the provided time frame. Citing the provision mentioned in Article 76 (3) of the constitution, Oli, being the leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, was re-appointed prime minister, requiring him to again prove a majority in the house within 30 days from his appointment. Following the dissolution of the House of Representatives by the president at midnight on 22 May 2021, the Oli government turned into an interim government until new elections, scheduled for 12 and 19 November 2021, were held.
Another major ministerial reshuffle took place on 4 June 2021, after the CPN (UML) formed a coalition with a faction of the People's Socialist Party, Nepal, after negotiations were reached to awards as many as ten ministerial berths to members of the faction led by Mahantha Thakur and Rajendra Mahato. The cabinet was further expanded on 10 June 2021. The Supreme Court, on 22 June 2021, stayed the cabinet expansion and reshuffle by Prime Minister Oli. The petitioners had earlier claimed that the government formed under article 76 (3) of the constitution with a caretaker status cannot expand or reshuffle the cabinet. Twenty ministers (including three deputy prime ministers) appointed on 4 and 10 June 2021 were dismissed from their post. Bishnu Prasad Paudel, who was appointed minister of Finance on 14 October 2020 and had been elevated to deputy prime minister on 4 June 2021, retained only his Finance portfolio after this decision. Prime Minister Oli thereafter divided the portfolios among the five remaining members of the cabinet on 24 June 2021.
Dissolution.
On 12 July 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the president's decision to dissolve the House of Representatives on the recommendation of prime minister Oli was unlawful and ordered the appointment of Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister within 28 hours, after the opposition alliance had filed writs against the dissolution of the House of Representatives. President Bhandari appointed Deuba as the prime minister in accordance with Article 76 (5) of the Constitution of Nepal, and he was sworn in for a fifth term on 13 July 2021.

It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018. It was released in the United States on March 15, 2019, by The Orchard and was released on March 22, 2019 in Canada by Elevation Pictures.
Plot.
The film opens as stockbroker Vincent Zaleski pitches Bryan Taylor on investing in a fiberoptic cable from Kansas electronic exchange to the New York Stock Exchange in order to front run orders in a new high-frequency trading (HFT) operation. Taylor buys into the idea. Meanwhile, Vincent and his cousin Anton Zaleski are still employed by Eva Torres, where Anton programs trading software. Eva is also working on several ideas for HFT. Soon enough, Anton and Vincent quit, making Eva furious. She insists that any code Anton created for her firm belongs to it, and even the thoughts in his head might be proprietary.
Vincent has hired Mark Vega to oversee the building of the fiberoptic cable tunnel. Vincent occasionally helps Mark purchase or lease the rights to land in order to make the cable as straight as possible. Any deviation in the shape of the tunnel will create delays in the trade. Anton is hard at work trying to shave 1 millisecond off the time it takes to front-run orders to NYC. Currently, his software will do it in 17 milliseconds, which is not fast enough to be competitive. It needs to be at most 16 milliseconds to be a viable enterprise for Taylor's firm.
Eva finds an NYU student who has written a paper about microwave pulses to effect HFT. She hires him, and starts the process of building a series of towers to make trades with microwaves. As Vincent struggles with acquiring land, being diagnosed with cancer, and broken drill bits, Eva manages to finish her microwave towers first, and begins front-running the market.
Eva also takes revenge on Anton by having him arrested by the FBI for stock market fraud by using stolen property in the form of the software that he wrote for her company. While Anton is in jail, a software bug that Anton installed at Eva's firm is released, causing a 20 millisecond slowdown in trading, rendering her microwaves useless. She drops the charges against Anton.
As Vincent undergoes chemotherapy, Anton reveals his next idea for HFT involves neutrino messaging, and it could cut the time from Kansas City to NYC down to as little as 9 milliseconds.
Production.
In May 2017, it was announced Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgård had joined the cast of the film, with Kim Nguyen directing from a screenplay he wrote. Pierre Even served as a producer on the film, while Brian Kavanaugh-Jones and Fred Berger served as executive producers, under their Item 7, Automatik and HanWay Films banners, respectively. In September 2017, Salma Hayek joined the cast, followed in October 2017 by Michael Mando.
Principal photography began in Quebec in November 2017.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2018, and was the opening gala at the Vancouver International Film Festival later that month. Shortly after, The Orchard acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It had a limited release in the United States on March 15, 2019.
Factual basis.
The communication systems portrayed in the film do exist. Spread Networks activated their essentially straight fiber-optic cable in 2010 saving approximately over the existing route from Chicago to New York, and their journey is depicted in Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys. McKay Brothers and Tradeworx began providing microwave radio service in 2012.
Reception.
Box office.
"The Hummingbird Project" grossed $371,784 in the United States and Canada, and $527,253 in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $899,037.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57%, based on 115 reviews, and an average rating of 6.02/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Smart and well-acted, "The Hummingbird Project" marks a flawed yet undeniably intriguing addition to writer-director Kim Nguyen's filmography." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Mike McCahill of "The Guardian" gave the film two stars out of five, stating "We get intriguing ideas, images and locations, and enough closeups of excavation equipment to enrapture plant-hire enthusiasts. With few narrative or thematic hook-ups, though, I guarantee plenty of head scratching in front of this curio". Odie Herderson of "RogerEbert.com" gave the movie two stars out of four, commenting "Though Nguyen is the only credited writer here, “The Hummingbird Project” feels like one of those movies where nine different people contributed to the proceedings without reading what anybody else wrote. I was ready to check out once we got to the major grab for sympathy (complete with hospital visit) that closes out the film. It's a shame because the acting is quite good here, especially an against-type Skarsgård. His Anton is rather complex and he gets one hell of a celebratory dance sequence. I identified with his little boogie-woogie; finally someone put onscreen what it feels like when your code does what it's supposed to do".
Ben Kenigsberg of "The New York Times" added "“The Hummingbird Project” may be too committed to its popcorn mechanics to double as a truly brainy exposé, but it pays other dividends. Eisenberg adds unexpected shades of humanity to his lizard persona from “The Social Network,” while a bald, unrecognizable Skarsgard pulls off the difficult feat of being sympathetically antisocial as a coder driven batty by his work. As the geological, financial and personal barriers the cousins face grow increasingly absurd, the movie works up a satisfying sweat". Jonathan Dean of "GQ" wrote, "But in its own way, the film winds up as "Margin Call" meets "Glengarry Glen Ross" meets, yes, "The Social Network". And by harking back to the latter, the director has the Eisenberg we fell for. It has his twitch, but with a heart, the idea he is the smartest man in the room, but doesn't want people to know it".

Chkalov Stairs

The Chkalov Stairs is a monumental flight of steps in the center of Nizhny Novgorod, connecting Minin and Pozharsky Square, the Upper Volga and the Lower Volga embankments. It was built by the architects Alexander Yakovlev, Lev Rudnev and Vladimir Munts. It is the longest staircase in Russia. The staircase starts from the monument to Chkalov, near the St. George's Tower of the Kremlin. It is built in the form of a figure of eight and consists of 560 steps, if you count it both sides. The number of steps from the bottom to the top is 442 on the right. In the intersections of the side slopes there are two observation platforms. At the bottom of the stairs is a monument to the boat "Hero", which is located at the Lower-Volga embankment.
History.
During the Russian Empire and until the mid-1940s of the 20th century, the site of the Chkalov Stairs was called the Volga slope. It was one of the most popular places among Nizhny Novgorod residents and visitors. At the top was a semicircular ledge from which a view of the floodplain of Bor. Now there is a monument to Chkalov.
The first ideas for the construction of the stairs on the Volga slope was put forward by Alexander Shulpin, the chairman of the Gorky City Executive Committee, in 1939. The stairs were to connect the center of the city with the Volga, and outdo the Potemkin Stairs in Odessa. But the realisation of the project was prevented by World War II (Eastern Front).
The realisation of the plans was delayed until 1943. That year, Gorky began actively rebuilding the destroyed buildings and industrial enterprises after the German bombing. Then Shulpin began to promote his idea again. In the same year he went on a business trip to Moscow and presented the project to the Leningrad architects Alexander Yakovlev, Lev Rudnev and Vladimir Munts. When the agreement was received, the Moscow government allocated money for the construction of this grandiose staircase in honor of the victory of the Battle of Stalingrad. The staircase itself was to be called the "Stalingrad Stairs". Construction was started the same year, carried out by German prisoners. The staircase was inaugurated in 1949. The chairman of the city executive committee spent about 7 million rubles on its construction, and was arrested for embezzling public funds in the Leningrad affair. He was rehabilitated after Stalin's death.
Present day.
The staircase is one of the most recognizable landmarks of the city. On the Chkalov Stairs they arrange sports races.
In 1985 a monument to the boat "Hero" was erected at the foot of the stairs The boat was popular with the newlyweds. Until 2008, its propellers were constantly decorated with colored ribbons. To somehow prevent this, metal structures were installed.
The last restoration of the staircase was carried out in 2012-2013.

Ansfried the Elder, Count in Lotharingia

Ansfried, was a Lotharingian count in the 10th century, who held 15 counties in Lotharingia, a "middle kingdom" of the Franks, which was in this period contested for by the larger eastern and western kingdoms surrounding it. He is sometimes referred to as "the elder" in order to distinguish him from his nephew, Bishop Ansfried of Utrecht, who was also a powerful count until he became a bishop.
Thietmar of Merseburg, describing Ansfried's nephew of the same name, named two "paternal" uncles, Ansfried and Robert, Bishop of Trier. This implies that Ansfried the elder is brother to Bishop Robert, who was himself described as a relative to the Ottonians, the royal family at the time. It was Thietmar who described Ansfried the elder, the uncle, as a count of 15 counties, and says it was he who sent his nephew to Bruno the great for his education, after he had already spent time with his other uncle.
If Ansfried was the same as the "advocatus" of the Abbey of Gembloux in the 950s, as is often thought, then he is described as a blood-relative ("consanguineus") of Wicfrid, the founder of that Abbey. He was probably also the rebel who held Chevremont in 939 after the Battle of Andernach, and the death of Duke Gilbert of Lotharingia.
Records.
Some of the records which are used to describe Anfried's life might have been describing someone else name Ansfried, such as his nephew.
Not yet described as a count, a first mention might be in 928, in a grant made by Gilbert, Duke of Lotharingia, involving the church of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. Jongbloed suggested this was Ansfried the elder partly because another junior witness is named Arnold, and the names Arnold and Ansfried appear in later records together.
In 939 a count named Ansfried is described by Widukind of Corvey as one of the leaders of the Lotharingian people. An Ansfried and an Arnold held the fortification of near Liège after the Lotharingians lost the Battle of Andernach in 939. They were talked down by their compatrior Count Immo and captured. Widukind wrote that Ansfried was partly convinced by an offer of alliance and marriage with the only daughter of Immo. Jongbloed has argued that this went ahead. However, Karsten points out that Widukind clearly wanted to give the impression that the offer was made in bad faith. After Ansfried and Arnold were captured, Widukind reports that Immo advised that Ansfried, being as "hard as iron", would need the harshest torments to question him.
In 950, a count Ansfried "fidelis noster" ("our faithful") was mentioned by Louis "d'Outremer", king of West Francia ("France"). Louis had married Gerberga, also present, the former wife of his ally Duke Gilbert of Lotharingia who had died at Andernach. Because this count was a vassal of the western king, there are doubts about whether it could be Ansfried, whose homeland of Lotharingia was by this time back under control of the eastern kingdom ("Germany"). However, Jongbloed (2009 p.32) argues that during this period the western kingdom was a defeated "quasi protectorate", and so being a double vassal would be possible.
Soon after, in a charter of 7 Oct 950, a place called Cassallum, probably Kessel on the left bank of the Maas between Roermond and Venlo, is described as being "in pago Masalant in comitatu Ruodolfi" (in the country of Maasland, in the county of Rudolf), and "cuidam vassallo nostro Ansfrid" (a certain vassal of ours Ansfried) is the beneficiary of the rights to have a market and mint in . 
From this time on, there is disagreement about whether there are any more sightings of the elder Ansfried in the records.
According to some historians such as Aarts, Ansfried the elder is mentioned by Sigebert of Gembloux as the advocate (vogt) of the newly founded Gembloux Abbey in the 950s, the reign of Bishop Balderic II in Liège. Historians who believe this argue that the younger Ansfried would have been too young. Van Winter on the other hand has argued that this record is incorrectly dated, and that these events in Gembloux must have been in the 980s after young Ansfried returned from Italy. There is therefore a similar debate about whether the elder Ansfried is also the son named Ansfried who observed in a transaction described by Sigebert, who served as a witness to a transaction between a noble named Lambert and the founder of Abbey, acting on its behalf, Wicbert (also written Guibert etc). However, this Ansfried is often suggested to be the younger nephew, and there is also debate about whether this Ansfried was in any case son of Lambert or of Wicbert. Nevertheless, all of these people are likely to be related to each other and presumably to share descent from Wicbert's grandparents Gisla and Rothing.
When Otto I returned from Italy in early 965, historians such as Aarts think that the Ansfrid who appears in a high position in a list from Liège must be him, and not his nephew who was still young, and who may indeed still have been in Italy.
Later in the 960s are two records of a Count Ansfried with a county in or near the Dutch river delta area, one in Varik in Teisterbant, and one in Toxandria. There is also one more charter which connects an Ansfried to the wife of his late Duke Gilbert, in 968, when he was involved in a charter concerning her allodial rights in the area of Meerssen in the Maasland.
In July 985, one of the Ansfrieds, "comes illustris vir", was holding the County of Huy, near Liège, which he granted to the bishop of Liège.
Notable non-consensus speculations.
There are two very notable proposals which have not created a lasting consensus, but which are discussed in secondary literature.
1. Vanderkindere (1902), proposed that Ansfried was in fact the same person as Ehrenfrid, son of Ricfrid, and that an otherwise unattested sister of this Ehrenfried married the above-mentioned Lambert, the so-called Count of Louvain. The elder Ansfried, in this explanation, would actually be Bishop Ansfried's maternal uncle, normally "avunculus" in Latin. This is no longer widely accepted.
2. Jongbloed (2009), proposed that Ansfried the elder married a daughter of Count Immo, based mainly on the story of Widukind mentioned above. He furthermore proposed that this Ansfried was, like his nephew with the same name, a founder of the Abbey of Thorn, though the two have later, according to him, become confused.

Romulea toximontana

Romulea toximontana is low a herbaceous perennial geophyte in the family Iridaceae native to South Africa. It has a small corm in the soil, several linear leaves, white trimerous flowers, yolk-yellow near the centre and with a purple wash on the outside. The 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants lists this species as rare.
Taxonomy.
"Romulea toximontana" was described by South African botanist and expert in bulbous plants Miriam de Vos in 1972. It has been assigned to the section "Ciliatae", a part of the subgenus "Spatalanthus".
Description.
"Romulea toximontana" is a low perennial plant of high, that survives the dry southern summer through storage of its resources in an oval corm. This corm is flattened obliquely and has a wide, fan-shaped ridge on the underside. Its stem may be entirely underground or reach a height of . The two lower leaves are about in diameter, have four narrow grooves along their length, and sometimes rows of very small, evenly spaced hairs (or ciliate). Each flower is subtended by two bracts. The outer bract has a narrow papery margin, while the inner one has a wide papery margin with a brown edge. The flowers do not smell and are white on the inside, yolk yellow near the centre, and have a purple wash on the outside of the six elliptic tepals of long. The stamens consist of long filaments topped by long anthers. When the fruit is ripe the flower stalk spreads widely. This species flowers in August.
Differences with related species.
"R. toximontana" and "R. montana" share the same type of corm, both having a very broad ridge on their underside, and fruiting stems spread out. "R. montana" however has yellow flowers with dark blotches or streaks in the throat while in "R. toximontana" the white flowers are yellow down the cup, while the outside of the tepals is purple. "R. toximontana" can be confused with "R. sladenii" because it also has white flowers and grows in the same environment on the Gifberg. The stamens of "R. sladenii" rise just beyond the floral cup whereas the stamens in "R. toximontana" are entirely contained. To be absolutely certain of the identification, the corms need to be examined. "R. sladenii" has symmetrical, bell-shaped corms with a lacerated ridge on the bottom, where "R. toximontana" has obliquely flattened corms and a wide, fan-shaped ridge.
Distribution.
"Romulea toximontana" is only known from a small area on the Bokkeveld plateau, the Gifberg and the Matsikamma Mountains, all near Vanrhynsdorp.
Ecology.
"Romulea toximontana" grows on sandy soils and weathered sandstone.

"From Afar" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Vance Joy. It was first released on 21 January 2013 as the lead single from Joy's debut EP "God Loves You When You're Dancing" (2013). It also featured on his debut studio album "Dream Your Life Away" (2014).
Joy said "I wrote [it] in 2010 and wrote the outro in 2012, and it’s a been a song I've played regularly the last couple of years because I just think it's a really universal theme of loving someone from a distance. It's a sad kind of song though the outro is a bit more upbeat and slightly more epic. That was something that happened when we produced the song. It's an old favourite of mine anyway."
The song was certified platinum in Australia in 2018.

List of highest historical junior scores in figure skating

The following list of highest historical junior scores in figure skating contains the highest junior scores earned before the 2018–2019 season under the ISU Judging System (IJS). The 2018–2019 season began on 1 July 2018.
After being trialed in 2003, the IJS replaced the old 6.0 system in the 2004–2005 figure skating season. Up to and including the 2017–2018 season, the Grade of Execution (GOE) scoring system for each program element ranged between –3 and +3. Starting with the 2018–2019 season, the GOE was expanded to range between –5 and +5. Hence, the International Skating Union (ISU) have restarted all records from the 2018–2019 season and all previous statistics have been marked as "historical".

Guy Chauvet

Guy Chauvet (2 October 1933 – 25 March 2007) was a French operatic singer in the tenor register, regarded as a Heldentenor.
Biography.
Born in Montluçon, Chauvet discovered his voice at the age of sixteen during a local party. At Cannes in 1954, he was the youngest member of the tenor competition and one of five prizewinners, with Alain Vanzo, Tony Poncet, Roger Gardes and Gustave Botiaux.
He started at the Palais Garnier as an Armored Man in "The Magic Flute" on 12 January 1959. To begin with, he held third roles in "Aida" with Renata Tebaldi and Rita Gorr and also in "Samson et Dalila" with Mario Del Monaco. He became the youngest tenor of the Paris Opera in the role of Faust in "La Damnation de Faust" on 20 September 1959. He has the same singing teachers as Georges Thill. His career as a strong tenor was thwarted by his teachers, and he only acquired his C at the age of 32.
Régine Crespin choose him as Énée; he next sang Arturo with Joan Sutherland as Lucia. He triumphed by interpreting Florestan while ensuring the world premiere of Grunewald's Sardanapale at Monte-Carlo.
Régine Crespin, Fiorenza Cossotto (with whom he sang "Samson and Delilah"), Gabriel Bacquier and Jon Vickers all worked with him, and he regarded Andréa Guiot as a sister. After a performance of "Samson and Delilah" at the Metropolitan, he obtained a standing ovation from the audience.
When Placido Domingo sang his first "Otello" in Paris, Chauvet was dressed and ready in case it was required he intervene.
He was the only French tenor to have sung "Aida" in Verona, alternating the role of Radames with Carlo Bergonzi, in August 1971 during the centenary of the opera's creation.
He was part of the revival of Meyerbeer's "Le prophète" with Marilyn Horne at the Metropolitan in 1977.
Guy Chauvet distinguished himself above all by the power of his emission, the timbre remaining clear and coppery throughout the whole range. He specialized in wide-ranging roles such as Faust of "la damnation", Samson, Pagliacci, Otello, Radamès, Enée, Siegmund, Lohengrin, around the world and above all in performances with the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He was also the advocate of such little known operas as Cherubini's "Les Abencérages".

Plot.
It is a Telugu-speaking community in Kolkata where a football player named Surya (Sharwanand) falls for a medical student named Vaishali (Sai Pallavi). The love story is not as simple as it appears to be. Surya starts trying to make Vaishali fall for him. After Vaishali falls in love with Surya and starts talking about marriage, Surya breaks up with her due to his fear of commitment as a result of his parents’ failed marriage. Vaishali tells him that exactly after a year, they will meet in Kathmandu, Nepal and decided whether they should get married or not.
Exactly after a year, the Nepal 2015 earthquake occurs, where Surya is searching for Vaishali. Simultaneously, Vaishali is searching for Surya in Kathmandu. In the earthquake Vaishali is injured and she asks her friend to tell Surya that she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia and still acts as if she is fine, with her friends and family except Surya. So Surya tries to make her fall in love again, in a similar way he tried before. One day his father (who is a famous author) comes nearby to give a speech which is attended by Vaishali, Surya and Surya's mother. During the speech Vaishali realizes her love for Surya and his love for her. She asks him to marry her, where he realises she hasn't lost her memory, infuriating him. In a struggle here, Vaishali faints and is admitted to the hospital where it is revealed that she actually has retrograde amnesia and told only Surya the truth and that she was slowly forgetting the things even in her daily life.
The movie ends with both of them getting married after a few months

Corranierna (Corlough)

Corranierna (Corlough) () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Corranierna is bounded on the west by Corraclassy and Gubnagree townlands, on the south by Derrynaslieve townland and on the east by Garvary (Corlough) and Derry Beg townlands.

Corranierna is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 60 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list ten tithepayers in the townland.
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The soil is of a light boggy nature...The townland is bounded on the north by a large stream".
The Corranierna Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 15, being 8 males and 7 females. There were two houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 4, being 3 males and 1 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were two houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists six landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 11, being 4 males and 7 females. There were two houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there is one family listed in the townland.

One Shot, Two Shot is the first Korean extended play by South Korean singer-songwriter BoA. Released digitally on February 20, 2018 by her native label SM Entertainment with Iriver as the distributor, the extended play is the singer's first major Korean release in nearly three years since her eighth Korean studio album "Kiss My Lips" (2015), and subsequently her second major release in 2018 just one week after releasing "Watashi Kono Mama de li no Kana", her first Japanese album in over four years also. Featuring seven new tracks that center around the singer's "alternate perspectives and approaches to matured romance", the extended play incorporates "heavy-bass" deep house and EDM genres, while seeing BoA exploring herself in new genres, such as trap and hip-hop. Wanting to "breathe some freshness" into her discography, the singer went on to collaborate with rapper Junoflo and producer Chancellor, whom also contributed lyrically and musically to the extended play along with several other producers, such as Yoo Young-jin, Devine Channel, Josh Cumbee, Tayla Parx, Micah Powell, Mike Daley, Mitchell Owens, Harvey Mason Jr., The Stereotypes, and more.
Upon its release, "One Shot, Two Shot" received positive reviews from critics, whom regarded the extended play as one of her best releases, further praising its mature sound comparing to her previous release. It was, however, a moderate commercial success in her native country, becoming her fifth top-ten entry on the Gaon Album Chart, as well as her second top-ten entry on the "Billboard" World Albums chart. To further promote the extended play, three singles were released in between 2017 and 2018; namely "Camo", "Nega Dola", and the titular "One Shot, Two Shot".

Melnaattu Marumagan

Melnaattu Marumagan () is a 2018 Tamil action film directed by MSS and produced by Mano Udhayakumar of Udhaya Creations. The film stars Rajkamal and Andreanne Nouyrigat in the leading roles, with Lollu Sabha Manohar and Muthukaalai in supporting roles. V. Kishorkumar composed the original score and soundtrack for the film, while Goutham Krishna handled the cinematography. Having begun production in September 2013, the film had went through production delays before being released on 16 February 2018.
Production.
In September 2013, director MSS convinced television actor Rajkamal to play the lead role in his film on a Tamil tour guide falling in love with a tourist. MSS chose to make "Melnaatu Marumagan" after his debut project "Neengatha Ennam" starring Bhanu Chander's son Jayanth, was shelved. "Melnaatu Marumagan" was to be produced by Bahadur Sha, with music by Kishore Kumar and cinematography by Gautham Krishna. Andreanne Nouyrigat, a resident of Pondicherry who has appeared in Tamil cinema, was then recruited to star in the lead role alongside Rajkamal. In the film, she played a Brahmin girl from Madurai and dubbed her own lines in Tamil.
The film was completed by January 2015, but a potential release date in February 2015 was bypassed. Following three years of delays and a change of producer, the team began promotions planning to release the film in early 2018. The team also announced plans of potentially releasing the film in France.
Release.
The film was released on 16 February 2018 across Tamil Nadu. In their review of the film, critic Suganth of "The Times of India" gave the film 0.5 stars out of 5, adding "it is the kind of film that makes you wonder why it was made in the first place and for whom". The critic added "and the all-round bad acting only makes it worse" and "by the time we reach the interval point, you stop worrying about the movie’s existence and start questioning your own".
Soundtrack.
The film's music was composed by V. Kishorkumar. The soundtrack was released on 22 August 2016 through Auro Music. The song "Yaroival" was written by lyricist Na. Muthukumar within thirty minutes on a car journey he had to Chennai airport.

People Give In

"People Give In" is a song by the Manic Street Preachers. It was released in July 2018 as the sixth single from their thirteenth album "Resistance Is Futile".
Background and reception.
As for the lyrics of the song Wire stated that: "One of the most open lyrics I’ve ever written. I wouldn’t exactly call it a rallying cry, it’s more about the idea that at least 80% of life is just really mundane so why don’t we all just lower our expectations and try to get to the other side as painlessly as possible. We’re all looking for universal panaceas all the time – if we expected a little less, we’d probably be happier The chorus is 'there is no theory of everything/no immaculate conception, no crime to forgive'. If you can’t do any good, do no harm - that’s my motto!" The single was released after a period where the band completed their tour and were asked to perform in Meltdown by The Cure's Robert Smith.
Reception.
The song was well received with The Quietus saying that it "is an acceptable statement of intent", while the NME said that the song is one where they "mourn for man growing tired, old, forgotten and being sold. But rather than collapsing under the weight of the sorrow of how 'there is no theory of everything', the band gloriously rise from the ashes – driven by their hardened will just to exist and grow stronger."

Distant Colours

"Distant Colours" is the second single taken from the Manic Street Preachers' thirteenth album "Resistance Is Futile" (2018). It was released on 16 February 2018.
Background.
The lyrics were written by vocalist James Dean Bradfield, rather than Nicky Wire, and inspired by disenchantment and Nye Bevan's old Labour. James said that "Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears." The video itself was by their long-standing visual collaborator Kieran Evans and stars actor Sarah Sayuri.
About the political aspect of the song Wire added that "I can't direct my anger at a single thing, politics is so overlapping and everything is so complicated that I think it's really trite to direct it at specific targets" (...) "That's the malaise we find ourselves in. It's the classic case of Tony Benn being the ultimate icon of socialism, and he never wanted to be in the European Union! Everyone keeps using him as a totem on the left, but are desperate to stay in the EU. People don't know their history, they toss things out there."
Talking further about the song Bradfield said that "It was just a song that came together in an amalgam of confusion and dejection at the general election and the American Presidential election," he tells "Clash". "I was just trying to kind of trying to figure out how you could define yourself by knowing what your enemy was like you did when you were 16 years old. Which, for me, was 1986, '85, '84. All those years. And I just decided that you couldn't any more because, obviously, the left has fractured, the centre left has fractured, the centre ground was unoccupied..."

"Dylan &amp; Caitlin" is a song by the Manic Street Preachers, released on 9 March 2018, taken from the album "Resistance Is Futile" (2018), and written by James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire and Sean Moore.
It is a duet between the band and The Anchoress, and it was the third single taken from the album.
Background.
About the song Wire said that "James wanted to have something on the album like 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' by Elton John and Kiki Dee, and I wanted to write something a bit character-based, which isn't really me. The extreme love and extreme hate that can take part in a relationship from both sides. You know us as a band, we've always felt a duty to pass on things that we think are more interesting than we are. From 'Kevin Carter' to 'Let Robeson Sing', it's a part of who we are. 'Interiors' was about Willem de Kooning, Richey had endless reference points. We've always had that desire to pass on. We're always seen as quite a negative, po-faced band, but we're not. It's just been about passing on our love of our inspiration." It stands as one of the few times he wrote a lyric outside of himself.
Bradfield further adds that the song is "conversation between Dylan and Caitlin Thomas at the apex of their alcohol soaked relationship." With Wire finishing with "The story itself rolls through their relationship – drinking, fighting and ended up broken by America. The conversational nature of the lyrics lent themselves to a duet so we asked Catherine to provide the female perspective. She's a hugely talented kindred spirit." The song was released with a video of an acoustic session played live.

Liverpool Revisited

"Liverpool Revisited" is a song by the Manic Street Preachers, it was the fourth single taken from their album "Resistance Is Futile". Written by Nicky Wire, it was released on 6 April 2018.
Writing and context.
The song is an attempt to eulogise the Merseyside city and give a salute to the defiance and perseverance of those who lost their loved ones in the Hillsborough disaster.
According to Bradfield, Wire wrote all components of the song: "It's about the 'Justice For The Victims Of Hillsborough' campaign. That campaign fought the entire British establishment to get to the truth, and they finally got there with their ruling." (...) "Nick wrote this song in its entirety. I think I'd gone home for tea with the family and by the time I got back, he'd done a guitar solo – which is a bit cheeky. When he gets into the flow of doing a song on his own, it does just flow." He added that: "When the ruling came out of the High Court, we were just about to do a gig at the Liverpool Echo Arena, and Nick had a day down on the waterfront where he just took loads of Polaroids and wrote loads of poetry, as he does."
Reception.
About the song musicOMH said that: "Liverpool Revisited acts as an upbeat tribute to the families affected by Hillsborough – a more upbeat, stirring anthem than the bleak SYMM, with talk of "dignity and pride, poetry and life".
As for The Quietus they said that the song is "melodramatic and passionate", stating that: "Wire's lyrics narrating a time he was overcome by tears, wandering around Liverpool with his polaroid camera and musing on the city's physical beauty and its defiant fight for justice following the Hillsborough disaster. Its lyrics are simple and direct (...) it is genuinely touching."
Music video.
On the day of release the band shared a lyric video on YouTube.

Vaginal cysts

Vaginal cysts are uncommon benign cysts that develop in the vaginal wall. The type of epithelial tissue lining a cyst is used to classify these growths. They can be congenital. They can present in childhood and adulthood. The most common type is the squamous inclusion cyst. It develops within vaginal tissue present at the site of an episiotomy or other vaginal surgical sites. In most instances they do not cause symptoms and present with few or no complications. A vaginal cyst can develop on the surface of the vaginal epithelium or in deeper layers. Often, they are found by the woman herself and as an incidental finding during a routine pelvic examination. Vaginal cysts can mimic other structures that protrude from the vagina such as a rectocele and cystocele. Some cysts can be distinguished visually but most will need a biopsy to determine the type. Vaginal cysts can vary in size and can grow as large as 7 cm. Other cysts can be present on the vaginal wall though mostly these can be differentiated. Vaginal cysts can often be palpated (felt) by a clinician. Vaginal cysts are one type of vaginal mass, others include cancers and tumors. The prevalence of vaginal cysts is uncertain since many go unreported but it is estimated that 1 out of 200 women have a vaginal cyst. Vaginal cysts may initially be discovered during pregnancy and childbirth. These are then treated to provide an unobstructed delivery of the infant. Growths that originate from the urethra and other tissue can present as cysts of the vagina.
Types.
Vaginal inclusion cysts can appear as small bumps and can develop during childbirth, or after surgery. A squamous inclusion cyst can rarely be found in a newborn. Other cysts can be Bartholin's cysts, Gartner's duct cysts, mucous inclusions, epithelial inclusion cysts, embryonic cysts and urothelial cysts. Less common vaginal cysts are endometrial cysts and vaginitis emphysematosa. Vaginitis emphysematosum is a group of gas-filled cysts on the vaginal wall; these are benign and self-limiting (resolve on their own). Vaginal cysts can also be congenital and associated with urinary system anomalies 
The most common type of vaginal cyst are Müllerian cysts. These usually develop on the anterolateral vaginal wall. This cyst can be lined with epithelium from the cervix, uterus and Fallopian tubes.
An epithelial inclusion cyst is also referred to as epidermal inclusion cyst or squamous inclusion cyst. This type of cyst comprises 23% of all vaginal cysts and is the second most common. This cyst originates from epithelium tissue that has been 'trapped' from surgery, episiotomy, or other trauma. It is most often found on the lower posterior vaginal wall. An epidermoid cyst is one type of vaginal cyst. Inclusion cysts are small and located on the posterior, lower end of the vagina. Small pieces of vaginal epithelium are trapped beneath the surface due to perineal lacerations and imperfect surgical repair after an episiotomy.
A Gartner's duct cyst develops from a small tissue remnant of the mesonephric duct. Symptoms include: infection, bladder dysfunction, abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and urinary incontinence. It is often large enough to cause urinary incontinence but surgical removal provides treatment and recurrence is unlikely. Diagnosis is confirmed with ultrasound imaging. The evaluation by biopsy provides the most accurate diagnosis. This cyst has a lining of epithelial tissue that varies from squamous to mucin-secreting transitional epithelium.
Occasionally, a parasitic infection causes a vaginal cyst.
Signs and symptoms.
In most instances, symptoms are minimal or absent. Some women may experience vaginal pressure, discomfort, swelling, painful sex, or bleeding. Cysts can also be sensitive and tender to the touch.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis is aided by the use of ultrasound, CT scan, voiding cystourethrogram, and MRI. Ultrasound findings may be the visualization of smooth margins of a fluid-filled structure. Vaginal cysts resemble other structures that protrude from the vagina such as rectocele and cystocele. Histological assessment is needed to determine the specific type of cyst. Vaginal cysts are often discovered during a routine pelvic exam or pap smear. Cysts are also discovered during a bimanual exam. Other structures that resemble vaginal cysts are connective tissue tumors, hematocolpos, and hymenal atresia. The absence of vaginal rugae over the cyst is a clue to their presence.
Treatment.
Many cysts remain small, are followed closely by a clinician, and resolve on their own. Surgery and/or drainage is performed to remove the cyst. Treatment continues after the surgical removal by scheduled followups with the medical provider who looks for changes in the cyst. Bartholin gland cysts often need to be drained. Sometimes, antibiotics are prescribed to treat them as well. Treatment for these usually includes aspiration, marsupialisation and deroofing. When cysts are treated complications are few. Vaginal cysts rarely recur. When surgically removed, the cysts usually do not return. In some cases a Bartholin cyst can develop and need further treatment. In most cases, there are no complications from the cysts themselves. A surgical removal carries a small risk of complication. The risk depends on where the cyst is located.

Star Carr Pendant

The Star Carr Pendant is a unique engraved shale pendant from the Mesolithic site of Star Carr in North Yorkshire. It has been described as the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain.
Discovery.
The pendant was found in 2015 by a team from the University of York during excavations led by Nicky Milner. It was excavated by Tom Bell, a student from the University of Chester on the last days of the excavation. It was found in a context from the edge of the palaeolake Lake Flixton.
Description.
The pendant is sub-triangular in shape and measures 31 mm x 35 mm x 3 mm. ED-XRF (energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence) was used to prove that it is made from shale. The front face is engraved with a series of parallel, incised lines which often cross each other. It has a perforation, made by drilling through from the engraved side at one of the lobes. 
On the reverse side to the engraving there is a nick caused by a missing flake of shale in the central region. This may have happened accidentally or intentionally, presumably by something hard striking this surface before it was deposited in the lake.
Significance.
The pendant is unique and is the earliest example of Mesolithic art in Britain. Whilst it is very similar to a number of other pendants from northern European sites, this pendant is unique as it is made from shale, whereas the other examples tend to be crafted from amber. It is also one of the few decorated pendants that have been found within an archaeological context and not as a stray find. Analysis by the research team suggest that there are two phases of markings on the pendant, and that it is possible that more than one person added to it over time. Different interpretations from those who have seen the engravings have suggested that it may represent a tree, a map, a leaf, tally marks, even a representation of the wooden platforms which have been found at Star Carr.
Public display.
The pendant is now in the Yorkshire Museum and first went on public display in February 2016.

Battle of Kidal (2012)

The first battle of Kidal took place during the Mali war. On 30 March 2012, the city was captured by rebel MNLA and Ansar Dine terrprist forces.
The battle and the city's fall.
On 26 March 2012, the city of Kidal was surrounded by MNLA, as well as by the Islamist troops of Ansar Dine. An MNLA executive reaffirmed that there is no link between the two entities, but acknowledged that the situation is ambiguous. Reports from locals in Kidal however, stated that both groups led the operation jointly. According to reports, the men of Ansar Dine were the majority of the rebels during the battle. The MNLA claimed to have proposed to the governor of Kidal and Colonel Gamou to promote the surrender of the army to prevent bloodshed.
On 29 March, Kidal was attacked by Ansar Dine and the MNLA, the Islamists attacked from the south while the Independents launched the assault on the north. The first day, the assault was repulsed by the Malian soldiers, but the next day some Tuareg militiamen of Ag Gamou, especially the fighters from Libya, deserted and joined the rebels.
On 30 March, the rest of the soldiers, demoralized and exhausted, abandoned the city. A soldier close to the Colonel-Major Elhadji Ag Gamou reported that "We were 504 armed men, 300 tamasheqs and 204 from the south. Since the 23rd March in Kidal, the Tuareg rebels of the MNLA and the Islamist group Ansar Dine of Iyad Ag Ghali surrounded us. The MNLA wanted Ag Gamou to return to the ranks of the rebels, and Ag Ghali wanted his head, for searching the houses of Ifoghas families and especially forcing the son of the powerful Kidal Amanokal, Intalla Ag Attaher, to leave the city in February. . (...) We were tired, because we spent the day fighting off the rebels and ensured all the following night not to be surprised by an attack. At around 7:00 am, some of us started sleeping, but an hour later the first rebel fire was fired on the east side of the city. We did not want to fight anymore."
The MNLA claimed victory. Abdul Karim ag Matafa, the president of the revolutionary council of the MNLA arrived in the city. According to witnesses, elements of AQIM also took part in the clashes.
Aftermath.
After the fighting, Iyad ag Ghali, head of Ansar Dine arrived in the city "at the head of a procession of vehicles. The governor of the region, six other local officials, the army zone commander, the colonel of special units and the head of the gendarmerie "are held in security" with a traditional chief, according to a local official's report.
Ag Gamou's ploy for retreat.
The Army withdraw to the south, after Colonel Alhaji Ag Gamou called Assalat Ag Habi, MNLA colonel who occupied the area and declared that he accepts his offer to join the MNLA in exchange for protection against Ansar Dine. "We left the city aboard our BM21 , BRDM and dozens of 4X4 Toyota, in the direction of Gao. The next day, March 31, the day of Gao's fall, we were 150 km south of Kidal, when several dozen cars of the MNLA fighters, commanded by the same colonel Assalat Ag Habi, surrounded us. He told Ag Gamou that to move freely on the territory of Azawad, he had to formally pledge allegiance to the MNLA and disarm his soldiers from the south. This is how the idea of calling RFI came. " On 31 March, Ag Gamou told Radio France Internationale that he joined the MNLA. However, later revealed that was the "defection" was only a ploy used by Ag Gamou so he would retreat south safety with his soldiers. Colonel Ag habi asked that the 204 soldiers from southern Mali be delivered to him as prisoners of war but Ag Gamou refused. He then headed with his men to Niger, 100 kilometers from the border, he called the consul of Mali in Niger by satellite phone to ask them to prepare for the arrival of his South-Malian men so they can be repatriated to Bamako, via Burkina Faso. Subsequently, Gamou folds himself in Niger with his family and his Tuareg militia. After that he informed the Malian government that his allegiance to the MNLA on RFI was a maneuver aimed at fleeing and he is ready to resume the fight.
Aftermath.
After the battle, the camp of the National Guard was looted and partly burned, the houses of officers were also sacked by residents. According to local accounts, the prisoners were well treated and Iyad Ag Ghaly gave instructions so that the civilians were not brutalized. In a video published on 11 July by Ansar Dine, the Islamist movement claimed to have captured 560 Malian soldiers in the battles of Aguel'hoc, Tessalit and Kidal. They were released after "giving their word never to fight the sharia of Islam." This number may be exaggerated, but on 14 April 2012, the Islamists of Ansar Dine released 169 Malian military prisoners, as well as 14 civilians belonging to families of soldiers.

The Nanny (season 3)

The third season of the American television sitcom "The Nanny" aired on CBS from September 11, 1995, to May 20, 1996. The series was created by actress Fran Drescher and her-then husband Peter Marc Jacobson, and developed by Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin. Produced by Sternin and Fraser Ink and TriStar Television, the series features Drescher, Jacobson, Fraser, Sternin, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk as executive producers.
Based on an idea inspired by Drescher's visit with a friend and "The Sound of Music", the season revolves around Fran Fine, a Jewish woman from Flushing, Queens, New York, who is hired by a wealthy Broadway producer to be the nanny to his three children. Drescher stars as the titular character, Charles Shaughnessy as British-born producer Maxwell Sheffield, and the children – Maggie, Brighton and Grace – portrayed by Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima. The series also features Daniel Davis as Niles, the family butler, and Lauren Lane as C.C. Babcock, Maxwell's associate in his production company who is smitten with him. Several recurring characters also played a role in the sitcoms plotlines, many of whom were related to Fran.

Prédateurs

Prédateurs () is the third full-length album by French band Les Discrets, released on April 21, 2017 by Prophecy Productions. It is their first album without drummer Winterhalter, who left in 2013 to focus on his other band, Alcest, and therefore their first as a duo.
Self-described as "the soundtrack of a slow film noir happening in a train where the journey leads the auditor to several places seen from the windows", "Prédateurs" is a musical departure from the shoegazing and post-rock sound of previous albums, shifting towards an indie rock sound influenced by electronic music, trip hop, and 1970's film soundtracks. It was preceded by two EPs, "Virée Nocturne" in August 2016 and "Rue Octavio Mey / Fleur des Murailles" earlier that year, which were meant to prepare audiences to the upcoming change of the band's sound; several songs from the EPs are featured on the album.
Production.
Writing.
Writing for the album started in 2012, shortly after the release of "Ariettes oubliées...". Teyssier originally started to write song in the same vein as previous Les Discrets works, but realized that he was disinterested in the result; after taking a break from music, he chose to create a new project, titled Saint Paul, which would follow a different musical direction, but after the project failed to come to life, decided instead to make it Les Discrets' third album, despite the artistic differences.
According to Teyssier, ""Prédateurs"' is a record for late evenings, night driving, journeys on a train, or for those moments we usually think about the meaning of life and things, when we have nothing else to do but sitting and waiting. Its main themes are time, nature and life [...] "I feel that Les Discrets has its own wings now, free of the influences of post-rock, post-black or post-anything constraints. He mentioned Massive Attack and Portishead as notable influences.
As with Les Discrets' previous works, the album features both original lyrics by Hadorn, and tracks using texts from classic French poets: Henri de Régnier for "Le Reproche" and Victor Hugo for "Fleurs des Murailles". Teyssier's interpretation of De Régnier's text is that it is from the perspective of a woman blaming for man for having used her years without ever giving her love or respect. Hugo's text was originally given to by Hadorn to Teyssier as a gift, before they decided to use it for their music.
Recording and post-production.
The recording of the album was completed in April 2015, with Teyssier completing the mixing in April of the following year.
The name of the album came from a discussion about the album between Teyssier and Alcest leader Neige. According to Teyssier, the main idea of the album is "to be careful not to loose more than we already lost". "Prédateurs" is the first work of Les Discrets for which Teyssier himself was not in charge of the cover art, which was instead the work of British photographer Chris Friel.
Reception.
The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised the change in musical direction and atmosphere of the album.
Metal Temple called "Prédateurs" "a unique and multifaceted release out of the ether" and "a stunning album that really ties together all of the influences perfectly. "Prédateurs" makes us reflect not only on the world we live in, but also on our place in this world and the impact we have on it", and gave the album a rating of 8 out of 10. Diamond in the Groove called the album "an admirable advancement for the group in terms of their appropriation of broader influences from across the stylistic spectrum into their downcast sound and grieving lyricism, all of which ultimately further Teyssier’s artistic vision for the project [...] "Prédateurs" is a hypnotic union of all manner of sounds and styles that come together to form a beautifully dark rock record", and gave the album a rating of 7.5 out of 10.
Ghost Cult called the album "an example of a band unshackling from its roots and developing a whole new identity, yet still being as compelling, dark, and utterly special as before". Metal Exposure considered the album "a beautiful piece of art", stating "the album has a quality and feel that kept me listening in wonder and admiration".
Conversely, Sputnikmusic was critical of the different musical orientation, stating "whether "Prédateur"s decides to be a little oddball or wallow in a murky rut, it ends up on the vexing end of the spectrum all the same. And that is what’s most disconcerting about this latest release from a once-promising project". The reviewer ended up giving the album a rating of 2.5 out of 5. Angry Metal Guy, despite acknowledging the "rich sense of depth" of the album, felt that most of the tracks "dwell in the realm of soppy, unmemorable post-rock that’s about as exciting as waiting to get picked up at the airport".

Hongkongers in the Netherlands

Hongkonger in the Netherlands are people in the Netherlands originated from Hong Kong or having at least once such parent. 
According to OECD figures there are 9,935 people in the Netherlands migrated from Hong Kong, a figure which would exclude people who declared other sources of origin and people born in the Netherlands to Hong Kong parents. 
, figures from the Netherlands' Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek showed that 9,757 Hong Kong-born persons (4,808 men, 4,949 women), and 8,440 persons with at least one parent born in Hong Kong (4,300 men, 4,140 women). 
The number of persons of Hong Kong background has shown only mild growth, entirely due to natural increase rather than additional migration; in fact the stock of Hong Kong migrants fell by 5.6% during the same period. 
According to F. N. Pieke, Hong Kong was a significant source of ethnic Chinese migrants to the Netherlands in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with about 600 to 800 per year, falling off to around 300 to 400 per year by the late 1980s.
While most Hongkongers are Cantonese by descent, there are Hongkongers who are of Teochew, Hakka, Shanghainese, Hokkien or South Asian descent, and people from overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Owing to Hong Kong's previous status as a British crown colony, the British nationality of the inhabitants and the existence of people with non-Chinese ancestry, Hongkongers overseas may or may not identify with the Chinese diaspora in the same country. 
One of the sources of Hongkongers in the Netherlands are Chinese Indonesians who first migrated to Hong Kong and moved onwards to the Netherlands with their children.

Commercial augmented reality

Commercial augmented reality (CAR) describes augmented reality (AR) applications that support various B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Consumer) commercial activities, particularly for the retail industry. The use of CAR started in 2010 with virtual dressing rooms for E-commerce.
For commercial purposes, AR applications are often used to integrate print and video marketing. With an AR-enabled device, such as a smartphone or smart glass, aiming a camera at a printed material can trigger an AR video version of the promotional and informational material superimposed on the image.
Apart from the primary use of CAR, technological advancements have yielded more commercial applications for retail, B2C and B2B markets operating with physical stores as well as online virtual stores.
History.
The history of commercial augmented reality is brief compared to that of augmented reality.
In 2010, virtual dressing rooms were developed for E-commerce retailers to help customers check the look and fit of products such as clothing, undergarments, apparel, fashion products, and accessories. An AR technology was developed in 2012 to market a commemorative coin in Aruba. In 2013, CrowdOptic technology was used to create AR experiences for an annual festival in Toronto, Canada. An AR app Makeup Genius released to try out beauty makeup and styles with the help of handheld devices was released in 2014.
An AR app was launched for the art market in 2015.. In 2016, a Wikitude app included an update to provide AR campaign opportunity to businesses. Users can point phone cameras at certain places and get information from websites such as Yelp, Trip Advisor, Twitter, and Facebook. In 2017, Lenovo developed a Tango-enabled smartphone to assist retailers. The Wayfair app enables customers to try a virtual piece of furniture in their home or office before buying.
Technology.
CAR technology dates back to the 1960s but grew considerably during the 2000s. According to CAR, technology involves several contemporary technology components. The three major components are the hardware, software, and algorithms of AR.
Hardware for commercial augmented reality.
With advancements in computing and allied hardware technologies, AR hardware such as display devices, sensors, input devices, and computing processors have improved over time.
Display hardware components for CAR.
Display hardware can be listed in the following ways: Head Mounted Display (HMD) such as a harness or helmet; eyeglasses, Head-Up Display (HUD); contact lenses; virtual retina display (VRD); and Eye Tap. Spatial AR (SAR) enhances real-world objects in spaces without depending on any display device. Those SAR are Shade Lamps, Mobile Projectors, Virtual Tablets, and Smart Projects.
Sensors for CAR.
Tracking and networking hardware must work in a seamless combination to bring about the desired level of mobility in CAR systems. The latest smartphones and tablets like mobile devices consist of cameras to act as an optical sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscopes for position tracking, solid-state compass and Global Positioning System (GPS) circuits, as well as sensors, for location detection, Radio-frequency identification (RFID) for radio signal detection, Wi-Fi for networking, and several mobile-based third-party sensors for a myriad of purposes.
Input CAR devices.
To bring complete interactivity in AR systems, different input devices are mandatory such as keyboards for textual inputs, speech recognition systems like Siri, Cortana, Google Voice and so on, gloves stylus, pointers, and other body wears with sensors to provide body gesture inputs, eye movement detection sensors, and hardware.
Software and algorithms for commercial augmented reality.
AR software should be capable of carrying an image registration process where software is working independently from the camera and camera images, and it drives real-world coordinates to accomplish the AR process. AR software can achieve augmented reality using two-step methods: It detects interest points, fiduciary marker, and optical flows in camera images or videos. Now, it restores the real-world coordinate system from the data collected in the first step. To restore the real-world coordinates data some methods used include: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), structure from Motion methods including-Bundle Adjustment, and mathematical methods like-Projective or Epipolar Geometry, Geometric Algebra, or Rotation representation (with an exponential map, Kalman &amp; particle filters, non-linear optimization, and robust statistics).
Commercial augmented reality programming technology.
The aim of ARML (Augmented Reality Markup Language) is defining and interacting with various Augmented Reality scenes. XML and ECMA scripts are parts of ARML. The role of XML is to describe the location as well as the appearance of the virtual objects in AR visualization. The dynamic access to the properties of virtual objects is possible using ECMA scripts binding.
Object model of augmented reality markup language.
The model is built on three main concepts. Features: Represents physical objects in AR scene; Virtual Assets: Represents virtual objects in Augmented Reality scene; and Anchor: Define the spatial relationship between a physical and virtual object in AR scene. The Anchors are four different types—Geometries, Tractable, Relative To, and Screen Anchor.
Commercial augmented reality SDKs.
Just like other technologies, AR application development kits are available for a rapid development process in the form of Software development kits (SDKs) including: CloudRidAR, Vuforia, AR ToolKit, Catchoom CraftAR, Mobinett AR, Wikitude, Blippar, Layar, Meta, and ARLab.
Applications.
Objective of CAR.
According to Hemant, the objectives of CAR is to bring virtual objects, which are generated by computers, into the physical world using simulation techniques. Moreover, it permits real-time interactions to benefit various commercial sectors and industries.
Commercial augmented reality simulation process.
The optical device that combines the real-world and virtual world experiences is "Combiner" which acts as a platform for commercial Augmented Reality experiences. Thus, the entire CAR process consists of three main phases. The first is recognizing the object or image. The second is object or image tracking in space. The third is superimposing virtual objects on the physical world.
Traditional combiners for CAR process.
The traditional combiners cover two implementations: The polarized beam combiners or flat combiners, or the off-axis combiners or curved combiners.
Non-conventional combiners for CAR process.
The non-conventional techniques involve diffractive optics as well as Holography. The hologram or waveguide concepts are involved in these non-conventional techniques and technologies. The real theory behind this is the extraction of a collimated image, which is guided by Total Internal Reflection (TIR) through a waveguide pipe. It behaves like a router where a waveguide is transmitting the image to the user's eyes and provides the most sophisticated optics to see through.
User interactions in AR.
Most of the AR devices use a touchpad and voice commands to provide user interaction facilities. Smartphones and tablet devices are the excellent candidates to interact with AR applications. Therefore, most of the AR applications in the market are handheld devices based on whether they use traditional or non-traditional AR techniques and technologies.
Commercial augmented reality applications.
Augmented reality is gradually changing the scenario of B2B and B2C businesses by providing AR applications. In due course, Hemant has listed several CAR applications in detail.
The AR dressing room application.
Fashion and apparel customers buy products after selecting the best fit by trying them on in a Changing room. This can result in lengthy queues waiting a vacant room. Topshop with Kinect has created CAR dressing rooms to overcome the problem to some extent. This technology has even allowed for size estimation in the dressing room. The Gap has followed the trend. The Augmented Reality dressing rooms are equipped with the AR devices, which are in turn helping focus on the targeted dress/product and capture the virtual 3D image of the product/dress. It helps to visualize the dress on the body of the shopper/user.
Product previews application.
The in-store retail customer can view a virtual preview of a product packed in a package, and even without opening it at all. An AR app for Lego is an ideal example of this use. Lego displays an animation of a product in an informative manner to the interested children and their parents. Image recognition technology is behind it rather than sticking a code on the box and scanning it.
To accomplish this, Lego has implemented a second-generation Sandy Bridge Intel Processor that can popup 3D animation over the top of the box. Moreover, the animation can move or rotate as the box moves or rotates. This is possible by the recognition of box movements and postures.
The CAR triggered products application.
The AR event was triggered automatically by focusing on an Aruba coin with AR hardware. The AR event revealed additional objects and information, which was invisible without the coin.
Makeup CAR application.
Shiseido has developed a makeup mirror called TeleBeauty that helps female shoppers to visualize the product performance on their faces well in advance of applying it. The capability of the AR mirror allows it to portray the shopper's image with lipsticks, eyeliners, and blushes with real-time updates.
Beauty style CAR application.
The best example is the Burberry Beauty Box AR application. It provides a nail bar application. Shoppers can choose their skin tone with the app and paint different polishes on the bar to check how the polishes look in real life.
Art market CAR application.
In 2015, an AR app was developed by Itondo with the aim of visualizing an art piece on different locations on walls before taking it from a gallery. It displayed live previews of a two-dimensional image of the artwork which is capable of scaling on the walls. Moreover, it enables an art gallery to display background previews using pre-saved photos of the different walls provided by the shopper. The app helps the user to visualize the best location for the artwork before they make a purchase.
The color changing CAR application.
American Apparel has products in varying types of colors and color combinations. This can make the color selection process daunting. Therefore, it has invented an AR app to help in the selection process without the customer having to wear the actual product. The AR app simulates the same products in available color choices and makes the selection process easier. The AR app provides real-time ratings and reviews uploaded by customers online and tempts online shoppers to visit the bricks-and-mortar stores.
The fitting CAR Application.
De Beers is a known entity in jewelry industry. It has released an AR app useful for online shoppers who wish to see jewelry products as if they are wearing them in the real world. The company provides images of products through Forevermark Fitting site the shopper can download and print on paper. Now, the user can use the mobile AR app by focusing a mobile camera on the image of the item. The app displays a virtual simulation of the jewelry products with real-time updates so products move with the user's movements and displays different facets at different angles. Moreover, customers can judge that how the jewelry looks in certain lighting and on different skin tones.
The catalog CAR application.
A product catalog for certain items like furniture cannot test in real life for a real environment. Moreover, small 3D images of products are of little use when the user wants to see the furniture product in real life in their home or office. IKEA has launched their AR catalog IKEA Place that helps to visualize the furniture products in real-world spaces like homes or offices. It also helps customers to judge the appropriate size and shape of the furniture be fitting in the actual environment that meets their needs.
The personal shopper CAR application.
IBM has released an AR app that helps shoppers to obtain detailed information on a product without touching it or inviting sales assistants to describe it. The CAR personal shopping application is capable of providing highly personalized experiences as well as marketing offers with a personalized touch. All this is possible in real-time if Beacon technology is applied in the store.
The shoe sampler CAR application.
The Converse Sampler is an AR app to assist customers to visualize a shoe with real-time updates. A customer needs to focus the camera of their mobile device on their legs after opening the app. The app provides a catalog for the selection of products. Once a selection is made the app begins superimposing products on the real world legs and gives an idea of the fit as well as its look so the customer can purchase the product online with confidence.
Controversy.
A controversy was created by "Pokémon Go", a game with two technical problems. The tracking and visualization processes handled in the absence of ergonomic, safe, and secure environment. The immersion in the game by players was too deep and resulted in several deaths, which caused some governments like China to ban the game. This unconventional combination of technology may lead to new inventions, but the cost of the hardware, software, and implementation makes it challenging for common commercial production.

Nervi International Ballet Festival

Nervi International Ballet Festival (Festival internazionale del balletto di Nervi) held during summer in Nervi (now a quartiere of Genoa) from 1955 to 2004 was the first event entirely dedicated to dance in post-war Italy. Together with the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto it is considered the most significant event of the Italian dance scene.
History.
In 1953, in Genoa Mario Porcile opened a classical ballet school, assisted by his friend and La Scala dancer Ugo Dell'Ara. In 1955 they opened the first Italian festival dedicated solely to ballet, set up for many years in the famous Nervi parks.
Since then, and until 2004, the event has had 34 editions, set up until 1992 exclusively outdoors in the Parks of Nervi; from 1995 to 1999 the shows took place between Teatro ai Parchi and Teatro Carlo Felice, from 2000 exclusively to Carlo Felice and other theaters in the city center.

Sri Tirupatamma Katha

Sri Tirupatamma Katha () is a 1963 Indian Telugu-language biographical film, based on the life of Penuganchiprolu Tirupatamma, produced by Donepoodi Krishna Murthy under the Gokul Productions banner and directed by B. S. Narayana. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Krishna Kumari and music composed by Pamarthi.

Quénonisca Lake

The Quenonisca Lake is a freshwater body of the municipality of Eeyou Istchee Baie-James (Municipality), in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, Quebec, Canada. The
northern part of the lake is crossed to the West by the Broadback River.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with an upstream navigable water body including the Broadback River and the Nipukatasi River.
The southern portion of the Quenonisca Lake hydrographic slope is accessible via a forest road (east-west direction) from the west, connecting the road going North.
The surface of Quénonisca Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Geography.
Quénonisca Lake is part of a group of lakes in the same area, which are formed in length, more or less parallel to each other, including the Salamander Lake (west side), the Rocher Lake (East side) crossed by the Nipukatasi River and Amisquioumisca Lake (East side).
Quenonisca Lake has a length of , a width of James
Bay, an elevation of and an area of .
Lake Quenonisca is mainly fed by the outlet of Lake Opataouaga, coming from the South and discharging at the bottom of a bay (length: ) on the South-East shore; and
by the dump of La Peupleraie lake pouring on the North-West shore. In addition, the Broadback River crosses the northern part of Quenonisca Lake to the west.
Quenonisca Lake is made up of 49 islands, one at its mouth and another
 in length near the southern part of Salamander Lake (lake neighbor on
the northwest side).
Areas around the lake have a generally level topography, except for:
Geology.
The "Intrusive Rocher-Quenonisca Suite" includes the Whitefish Intrusion (nAwf) that outcrops mainly between lakes Quenonisca and Rocher (NTS sheets 32K09 and 32K10), Rocher Intrusion (nAlrc) and another small peridotite intrusion of less than in diameter that cuts the paragneisses of the "Rock Complex" (nAroc) and the migmatitic gneisses of the "Bétulaie Complex" (nAbtu) in the area of Rocher Lake (NTS sheet 32K09).
This convert was originally described as the "Rock-Kenonisca Massif" by Franconi (1974) in his report on the mapping of the western half of the Frotet-Evans volcano-sedimentary band. It was renamed "Rocher-Quénonisca Intrusive Suite" by Brisson (1998) when mapping the Lac Rocher region (NTS sheet 32K09). The addition of the Whitefish Intrusion (nAwf) and the Rock Intrusion (nAlrc) as lithodemes in the Rocher-Quénonisca Intrusive Suite is proposed as a result of Leclerc and Caron-Côté field work and compilation. (2017).
Toponymy.
Of Cree origin (Eastern Cree, Northern dialect), this hydronym means "the long lake".
The toponym Lac Quénonisca was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, at the creation of this commission.

Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno

Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno was an Italian company producing steam locomotives and cars, active from 1887 to 1918.
Origins.
The origins of the engineering company are to be found in a framework of political agreements of the economic-military alliance assumed by the Kingdom of Italy, the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 1880s. Favoured by these international cooperation agreements, the German company Maschinenfabrik Esslingen founded the Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno in the Varese municipality and began to manufacture its renowned steam locomotives in Italy.
Production.
Between 1887 and 1913, the company built steam locomotives of various track gauges for a number of railway companies. Beginning in 1894, it began assembling Peugeot Type 3 cars, produced under a Peugeot license and with engines supplied by the French company.
World War I.
During the First World War, the company converted to war production. At the end of the conflict the company, until then predominantly backed by German capital, was acquired by the engineer Nicola Romeo with backing from a Swiss bank, but it appears that Romeo closed the plant in 1918 and did not revive it until 1925.
Nicola Romeo.
In 1911 Nicola Romeo (later the owner of Alfa Romeo) founded the limited partnership "Ing. Nicola Romeo e Co." for the production of mining machinery. The company soon began to specialize in the production of railway rolling stock, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the emerging internal combustion engine technology to license some of the first Italian railcars. After some years of inactivity, Romeo re-started the Costruzioni Meccaniche plant as CEMSA in 1925.

Henry Monteith

Henry Monteith of Carstairs (1764–1848) was a Scottish businessman and Tory politician who twice served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1814 to 1816 and 1818 to 1820, and as MP for Linlithgow 1820 to 1826 and 1830 to 1831.
Life.
He was born the sixth son of James Monteith (b. 1734) a merchant-weaver making cambric on Bishop Street in the Anderston district of Glasgow, and his wife, Rebecca Thomson. His eldest brother, John Monteith, had Scotland's first steam-driven power loom factory in Pollokshaws. The family were originally from the Aberfoyle area and had fought off raids from Rob Roy.
He studied at Glasgow University graduating in 1776. Trained in the family weaving business he owned his own factory Henry Monteith &amp; Company by 1785. In 1802 he opened a second factory making handkerchiefs in the Barrowfield district, and when James died later that year also took over his power loom factory in Pollokshaws. His workforce peaked in 1804 with a huge 6000 employees.
In May 1820 in his role as Lord Provost, he had to make provisions for the "Radical War" of the Scottish workforce, employing militia to counteract this insurrection. In the same capacity he oversaw the hanging of James Wilson on 30 August 1820 on the alleged charge of treason.
He was succeeded as Lord Provost by John Thomas Alston.
He lived at Westbank House on Renfrew Road in Glasgow. In 1820 he came to an arrangement with the Fullerton family (whose daughter he later married) to acquire their estate in Carstairs and commissioned William Burn to design a country seat for him, known as Carstairs House, which was completed 1823/4.
His most controversial parliamentary action was his involvement in the Jamaican slave trials of 1826.
He died at Carstairs House in December 1848. He is buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery in central Glasgow. The grave, flanked by short granite columns, lies on the west outer side of the central enclosure. He also has a very large memorial on the northern slope of the Glasgow Necropolis overlooking Glasgow Cathedral.
Carstairs House was bought by Sir James King, also a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, in 1899. It was renamed Monteith House in his memory on the late 20th century. Monteith Row in Glasgow was also named in his memory.
Family.
He was married twice: in 1788 to Christian Cameron and in 1826 to Sarah Fullerton of Carstairs.
He was father to Janet b. 1789, Rebecca b. 1790 d. 1868, Jean b. 1792, Christina b. 1792, Agnes b. 1799, Mary Henry b. 1801 d. 1878, Henry b. 1803, Robert b. 1804, John b. 1807, Catherine b. 1808, James b. 1809 d. 1809. Christina is the Mother of children listed. 
Henry also fathered Henry Monteith b. 1822 d. 1903 by Janet Hodge b. 1802. Henry and Janet never married, she is said to have been a member of staff at his home in Carstairs.
Artistic Recognition.
He was portrayed by Sir Henry Raeburn.

LIAS (gene)

Lipoic acid synthetase is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LIAS gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the biotin and lipoic acid synthetases family. It localizes in mitochondrion and plays an important role in alpha-(+)-lipoic acid synthesis. It may also function in the sulfur insertion chemistry in lipoate biosynthesis. Alternative splicing occurs at this locus and two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified.

<doc id="56612718" url="?curid=56612718" title="Dolly Varden (yacht)">
Dolly Varden (yacht)

Dolly Varden was a British racing yacht.
History.
The boat was built in 1872 at Whites Shipyard at Cowes on the Isle of Wight as an Itchen ferry design, and used initially as a fishing vessel in the Solent. She was later converted to a racing yacht by Richard Grant, the then secretary of the Royal Yacht Squadron, who won many races with the boat.
In 1888 Dolly Varden was sold to Thomas Ratsey, the co-founder of Ratsey and Lapthorne, a very famous sail making company based in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Thomas modified the hull in order to increase sail capacity and enable her to tack better. 
Following these modifications, the boat won almost every race in which it was entered. Ratsey also used Dolly Varden as a test rig to try out several new sail designs, including those for the Americas Cup.
King George V and Uffa Fox, who subsequently sailed with Prince Philip and taught Prince Charles to sail, were both guests aboard Dolly Varden.
Fox referred to the boat as the “Queen of the Solent” and “probably the fastest boat of her length in the world” in spite of the fact that she was then 65 years old.
Ratsey lived aboard Dolly Varden in the summer of 1934 where King George V and Queen Mary visited him. Ratsey died a year later in 1935. His son Chris continued to race Dolly Varden up to the start of the Second World War when it was sold to Claire Lallow's Boatyard on the Isle of Wight. When the boatyard was destroyed by bombing, Dolly Varden was drafted into service as the family home until the end of the war. 
After the war Dolly Varden disappeared, and there appears to be no record of the boat until 1965, when it was bought by a Dennis Riley from Southampton. Following extensive renovation, Dolly Varden was moored on the River Hamble where volunteers from a local youth club became her regular crew.
Although Dolly Varden's full history was not known to this group, they were aware that it was nearing its 100th birthday, so in August 1970 they took Dolly Varden on a "centenary" voyage to Paris, from the Hamble River to Le Havre, and then up the Seine into the centre of Paris where the boat was moored for a week before returning home.
Dolly Varden was sold to John Perkins in 1978. After sailing the boat for a few years, Perkins took it out of the water for restoration in a smallholding. The work wasn't completed, the boat was left in a field, covered by a tarpaulin for the next 25 years. In 2016 the smallholding was sold, and the owner considered setting fire to the hull. Instead, it was taken to the International Boatbuilding Training College at Portsmouth for restoration.
Some of the boat's hull on one side was missing and damaged, but according to a surveyor, the hull was mainly sound and repairable. Following a change of management at IBTC the restoration Dolly Varden was moved to Weymouth.
Current work.
Dolly Varden has been registered with National Historic Ships as an historic vessel of national importance. Its original racing pennant is housed in the Cowes Maritime Museum. The boat is believed to have been named for “Dolly Varden”, a character in Charles Dickens' 1880 novel "Barnaby Rudge".
Dolly Varden's original tiller arm is hanging in Ratsey and Lapthorne's offices. It is estimated that the cost of restoring Dolly Varden will be in the order of £300,000 and a fundraising exercise is under way to get the boat sailing again.

Williamson Trust

The Williamson Trust is a multi-academy trust centred around the Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School, and the Hundred of Hoo Academy in Rochester, Kent.
The trust embraces Sir Joseph Williamson’s Mathematical School, The Hundred of Hoo Academy, High Halstow Primary School, Elaine Primary Academy, Allhallows Primary Academy and Stoke Community School. With the Rochester Diocese Board of Education, they co-sponsor of St James’ Church of England Primary Academy School in Grain. The Trust is governed by the board of twelve directors. It delegates many powers to local governing bodies- the local body at Hundred of Hoo has six governors- one of whom is a staff governor and one a parent governor.
On 5 November 2018 it was confirmed that The Williamson Trust would merge with Leigh Academies Trust (LAT), although the wording of the press release suggests that The Williamson Trust is effectively being taken over.
History.
The trust was established by governors of the selective Rochester Maths School to oversee the development of the comprehensive The Hundred of Hoo School. It took over responsibility for several of the Hoo Peninsula primary schools. It took responsibility for Elaine Avenue Primary School in Strood.
In January 2018, it disposed of Elaine School, having failed to make any improvement, passing it to the Inspire Trust. The DfE had written to the trust expressing concern about the lack of progress at this school and at Stoke and Allhallows.
In February 2018, the death was announced of the trusts CEO, Gary Vyse, at the early age of 37.A verdict of suicide was recorded.

<doc id="56612738" url="?curid=56612738" title="Way of the Taiping">
Way of the Taiping

The Way of the Taiping, also known as the Way of the Great Peace, was a Chinese Taoist movement founded by Zhang Jue during the Eastern Han Dynasty. Its adherents all around China participated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184, with the rebellion being suppressed within the same year by the Eastern Han government. The religious movement was greatly reduced and died soon afterwards. The Way of the Taiping was one of the two largest movements within early Taoism, with the other being the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. During the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the movement was recorded to have been popular in eight Provinces: Qing Province, Xu Province, You Province, Ji Province, Jing Province, Yang Province, Yan Province, and Yu Province.。
Origins.
The Way of the Taiping originated in the reign of Emperor Shun of Han of the Eastern Han Dynasty (126-144). A Fangshi named "Gan Ji" (Some later histories referred to him as Yu Ji) claimed that he received a divine book called the "Taiping Qingling Shu" (太平清領書) from a pond in Quyang County, and thereafter started to build elaborate temples and established rituals like the burning of incense and the reading of Taoist manuscripts. He also treated the people's (Baixing) illnesses with burnt Fulu mixed with water, and he became very popular amongst them. According to the "Book of Later Han", during the reign of Emperor Shun ( 125–144), Gong Chong (宮崇), one of Gan Ji's disciples, submitted the "Taiping Qingling Shu" to the emperor, but did not receive substantial attention. Gong Chong's disciple Xiang Kai tried the same, but his efforts also faltered. Later on, the book fell into the hands of Zhang Jue, who established the Way of the Taiping.
Later Developments.
Zhang Jue from Julu Commandery, having obtained the "Taiping Qingling Shu", declared himself "Great Teacher" (大賢良師), preached to his disciples and treated peoples' illnesses. He quickly became popular, as he sent his eight disciples around the country, using the "Kind Way" (善道) to preach to the commoners, and within ten years had followers numbering 100,000, across eight Provinces: Qing Province, Xu Province, You Province, Ji Province, Jing Province, Yang Province, Yan Province, and Yu Province. Zhang Jue split his followers into 36 "Fang"s (directions), with the bigger Fang having over 10,000 each, while the smaller Fangs having 7,000 people. He and his brothers gave themselves titles: Zhang Bao was the "General of Land" (地公將軍), Zhang Liang was the "General of the People" (人公將軍); and Zhang Jue was the "General of Heaven" (天公將軍). The Way of the Taiping acted like a military organisation thereafter.
Preachings.
Zhang Jue held a nine-section cane, and often proclaimed that people were sick and suffering because they had sinned. For them to recover, the patients must first reflect on their mistakes, and when they finally show contrition, he would make them drink the Fulu-water mixture. He praised those who recovered as having great faith, and for those who did not as having not enough. The Way of the Taiping worshiped the colour yellow, and followers wore yellow clothes with yellow headbands, and they worshiped the Yellow Emperor, Laozi and Taiyi (太一), who was the greatest God in the pantheon. Taiyi is an anthropomorphism of the North Star.
Uprising.
Zhang Jue proposed the slogan of "Cangtian (heaven, blue sky) is dead, the Huangtian (yellow sky) has been established, the age is at Jiazi (184AD), tianxia experiences great fortune" (蒼天已死，黃天當立，歲在甲子（184年），天下大吉), and theorised that of Zou Yan's cycle of five elements (Wu Xing), the Earth (Yellow) element was to replace the Han Dynasty's Fire element. Zhang Jue's followers wrote the slogan in the capital and yamen walls of the provinces and prefectures, and planned for the leader of the large Fangs Ma Yuanyi to lead the tens of thousands of followers from Jing Province and Yang Province to rise up on the 5th of March 184AD. Ma went around the capital and nearby cities to prepare for the rebellion, and had officials within the Palace walls as spies. But the central government caught wind of the conspiracy, and Ma was torn asunder by chariots for treason. Emperor Ling of Han ordered the arrest of Zhang Jue and his followers, and this prompted Zhang to initiate the Yellow Turban Rebellion in February, with the scale of the rebellion shocking the court. New followers flocked from all over the country to join the Way of the Taiping.
Defeat.
Within the same year of the uprising, Zhang Jue died from an illness, Zhang Bao was killed, and Zhang Liang fell in battle. The Yellow Turban Army still resisted in various locales for the next ten years, and many joined Cao Cao's army later on. The Way of the Taiping survived in a different form, even after the Jin Dynasty, in the worship of the Taiping Di Jun(太平帝君).

<doc id="56612740" url="?curid=56612740" title="EE Ltd v Office of Communications">
EE Ltd v Office of Communications

EE Ltd v Office of Communications [2017] EWCA Civ 1873 is a UK enterprise law case, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
EE Ltd claimed that Ofcom’s decision to set licence fees for 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands of radio spectrum for mobile phones wrongly interpreted its powers. Under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 s 5 the Secretary of State could give Ofcom directions about performing its functions. It issued the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (Directions to OFCOM) Order 2010, where art 6 required Ofcom to revise its annual licence fees for 900MHz and 1800MHz bands to reflect full market value, and conduct an auction. In 2015, Ofcom decided the new licence fees by reference to their best possible alternative use, or scarcity value, as opposed to a ‘costs recovery’ basis. This meant licence fees charged to EE Ltd went from £25m to £75m a year. EE Ltd argued this wrongly excluded considerations in the Communications Framework Directive 2002/21 article 8, requiring a National Regulatory Authority (i.e. Ofcom) to (1) promote competition, (2) develop the internal market, and (3) promote EU citizen interests (4) apply objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate principles. Ofcom admitted it failed to consider article 8 criteria, in an impact assessment because it argued its discretion was eliminated by the Secretary of State's direction.
Judgment.
High Court.
Cranston J held Ofcom correctly interpreted art 6 of the Order, requiring full market value. Once the SS had issued a direction under WTA 2006 s 5, Ofcom’s duties under the Directive were replaced by the Direction.
Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal held that art 8 considerations were not taken into account, and they ought to have been. The Secretary of State was not authorised by WTA 2006 section 5 to direct Ofcom to ignore its statutory duties under the Directive. They were non-delegable. Nor could the Secretary of State relieve Ofcom of its statutory duties. This meant Ofcom would have to reconsider its decision taking into account article 8. Delegated legislation should be read to avoid a conclusion that it is ultra vires: "Raymond v Honey" [1983] 1 AC 1. The word ‘reflect’ should mean ‘set by reference to’ as Ofcom argued, which meant art 6 did not exclude the art 8 considerations from Ofcom’s decision on the licence fee. Therefore Ofcom failed to give effect to the Direction, as properly construed, and would have to reconsider the fees it had set. 
Henderson LJ and Asplin LJ agreed.

Alberto Vassallo-Torregrossa

Alberto Vassallo di Torregrossa (28 December 1865, San Cataldo, Sicily - 7 September 1959, San Cataldo) was an Italian prelate and church diplomat.
Life.
The son of baron Rosario Vassallo di Torregrossa, he attended the minor archepiscopal seminary at Catano the San Michele College in the Acireale and finally the Pontifical Roman Seminary, where he graduated in theology and civil and canon law and gained a diploma in letters. On 22 September 1888 he was ordained a priest in the church of San Sebastiano in Caltanissetta by Francica-Nava de Bontifè, bishop "in partibus" of Alabanda and auxiliary bishop to Alberto's uncle Giovanni Guttadauro, bishop of Caltanissetta. He held his first mass in the mother church of San Cataldo. 
In 1889 he was admitted to the Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles to study as a church diplomat. In 1891 he was made a canon of San Cataldo and he also brought the Ursulines to San Cataldo. His uncle, bishop Guttadauro, called him "the pearl of his diocese". In 1892 he entered the Secretariat of State and six years later pope Leo XIII made him a secret chamberlain. Cardinal Rampolla spotted him and he was sent to the apostolic nunciature of Bavaria in Munich as a secretary. In 1902 he became auditor to the Nunciature to Brussels, where he wrote "Piccolo studio del clero belga" and was awarded the Order of Leopold. The nuncio there sent him back to Munich and he was decorated with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.
On 25 November 1913 Pope Pius X made him titular archbishop ("in partibus") of Emesa and sent him as apostolic delegate to Colombia. On 10 January 1914 the pope granted him a private audience and on the following 18 January he was consecrated a bishop in the Latino-American college by Cardinal Merry del Val. The pope received him for another private audience on 25 January 1914. Pope Benedict XV sent him to Argentina as a diplomat in 1916 and he was made Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria in August 1925, succeeding Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII). He was granted the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, the Order of Saint Michael, and the Royal Order of Albert of Saxony. 
The German states later lost their autonomy and in the wake of this ceased having their own diplomatic representation from the Holy See in January 1934. The Bavarian nunciature in Munich was closed on 23 October 1936. Vassallo di Torregrossa returned to Italy and retired to San Cataldo, where he died aged 93. On 27 April 2009 his body was exhumed in the presence of Mario Russotto, Bishop of Caltanissetta, and reinterred on 7 September 2009, the fiftieth anniversary of his death, in the mother church in San Cataldo, near the tomb of Cataldo Naro.

Achagoyle Bay

Achagoyle Bay is coastal embayment, on a chord of 0.75 miles, on a 114° orientation, on the western coast of the longest sea loch in Scotland, Loch Fyne located in Argyll and Bute, on the west coast of Scotland. Achagoyle Bay is directly northwest of Brainport Bay on a NNE orientation, which forms a rightward hook, and opens into the Minard Bay with a NE orientation, also with a rightward hook, directly south. The three bays constitute the western edge of the Minnow Narrows which is bounded by the islands "An Oitir" and Eilean Aoghainn directly to the east of Brainport Bay.
Settlements.
The small village of Minard is on the northwest corner of the Achagoyle Bay.
Geography.
Achagoyle Bay is dominated by the large hill Beinn Ghlas, one of the Marilyns in southern Scotland, at 420m to the north. Beinn Ghlas forms a ridge that parallels Loch Fyne to the northwest. Most of the area surrounding Achagoyle Bay is heavily forested.
Bronze age feature.
To the south of the bay, on Brainport Bay, lies a Bronze Age structure, that was excavated in the 1970s, and dates to the mid 2nd millennium BC. It achieved notoriety in the 1970s when it was excavated by the local archaeological society, when a curious alignment of artificial structures came to light. It includes a back platform, a flat area around a natural rock outcrop, two large boulders standing on end, known as the observation boulders, with a flat cobbled area between, and a main platform, again artificially enhanced. The main platform appears to have been an extraordinary sighting device. Two slender standing stones, of a height of slightly over 1m tall stood upright in clefts between the rocks. Although they have fallen, these two stones would have lined up, on a notch between two mountains, on the distant horizon from the site, some 30 miles northeast along the loch.
During the Bronze Age, the midsummer sunrise would have occurred just a little to the left of the north, crossing the exact alignment, passing just above the north a few minutes later. The stones were designed, such that even in bad weather, a sighting would have still been made, that would appear exactly with the notch, and aligned perfectly.

Fall of Timbuktu (2012)

The Fall of Timbuktu took place during the war in northern Mali. This is one of the first clashes between the MNLA and Ansar Dine.
The battle.
On June 13, 2012, at approximately 10:00 am, an MNLA vehicle arrived at a station at the south-eastern entrance of Timbuktu City, on the Goundam Road. A quarrel started between the separatist fighters and Islamists who guarded the post, with the terrorists demanding that the men of the MNLA to lay down their weapons, which they refuse. Fighting then erupted. An Ansar Dine commander stated that "MNLA defeated elements wanted to move into the city, they were asked to put down their weapons, they refused and started firing, we fought back. Two of our elements were hit in the skirmish but without gravity, they were treated and are doing well " According to Oumar Sall, a member of the High Islamic Council of Timbuktu; "It happened at the eastern exit of Timbuktu, where there is a post held by Ançar Dine. MNLA people wanted to go, but Ançar Dine refused and there was a hang-up." Later, the islamists issued a deadline for the MLNA to leave the city at the end of the month.
Fall of the city.
On June 29, Ansar Dine was reported to have taken control of Timbuktu after MNLA fighters followed their deadline to leave town. Residents confirmed the MNLA was no longer present, as the Islamist movements confirmed their control over the entire northern Malian region of Azawad.
Aftermath.
Destruction of shrines.
At the same time, UNESCO responded to appeals from the Malian government in Bamako to declare several sites within the city as "endangered" because it "aims to raise cooperation and support for the sites threatened by the armed conflict in the region." On 30 June 2012, a local journalist said that he was told Ansar Dine would start destroying 13 more Sufi cemeteries and mausolea of saints after having destroyed three, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar. They were then said to have destroyed the mausolea of Sidi El Mokhtar, Alfa Moya and five other sites with pick-axes, hoes and Kalashnikovs.
Despite earlier claims that they had stopped taking down the tombs, on 1 July about 30 members of the group were reported to have continued taking down four more sites with hoes and chisels at the cemetery of Djinguereber Mosque, including that of Cheikh el-Kebir, Sidi Elmety, Mahamane Elmety and Sidi Mahmoudou by late afternoon. Ansar Dine's Omar Ould Hamaha said that "the only tribunal we recognise is the divine court of shariah. The destruction is a divine order. It's our prophet who said that each time that someone builds something on top of a grave, it needs to be pulled back to the ground. We need to do this so that future generations don't get confused, and start venerating the saints as if they are God...We are against tourism. They foster debauchery."
On 2 July there were more destructions, most notably at Sidi Yahya's mausoleum, one of the three "great mosques" in the city built in the 15th century during the Islamic Golden Age, according to UNESCO. The militants broke down the door to the shrine, which, according to a local imam, was not supposed to be opened until the end of days. Sanda Ould Bamana then told the BBC that Ansar Dine had done almost 90% of what it sought to in destroying the mausolea in accordance with "sharia", which he said does not permit tombs to be taller than 15 centimetres. Local imam, Alpha Abdoulahi, said that the militants wanted to "destroy the mystery" of the gateway and that he was offered "50,000 CFA for repairs but I refused to take the money, saying that what they did is irreparable."
In September 2012, Islamists destroyed the mausoleum of Cheik El-Kebir, located 330 kilometers from Gao. The tomb had been venerated by people of the Kunta tribe. Further destruction occurred with four mausoleums being razed on 23 December and an Ansar Dine official, Abou Dardar, being quoted by "Agence France-Presse" as saying that "not a single mausoleum will remain in Timbuktu."
On 28 January 2013, as French-Malian troops captured Timbuktu Airport, the departing forces set fires within the Ahmed Baba Institute, which they had used as a barracks. Initial reports incorrectly stated that the building and all its contents were destroyed. The fire destroyed or damaged some 4,000 manuscripts, but another 10,000 that were kept in underground storage were undamaged. During the occupation, Timbuktu residents ran great risks to smuggle tens of thousands of other priceless manuscripts to relatively safe locations. The manuscripts that the rebels did destroy had all been previously preserved in digital form.
Reactions.
The MNLA's spokesman Hama Ag Mahmoud, speaking from Nouakchott, said of the destructions that "the perpetrators of these heinous acts, their sponsors, and those who support them must be made accountable." On the 12 July, the MNLA released a statement that read "we call on the USA, France and all other countries who want to stand against Ansar Dine, Boko Haram and al Qaeda who are now holding Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal to help us kill them and help the people in those cities." The MNLA and Tuareg refugees claimed, in interviews with the Western media, that Islamists had only previously bested the MNLA, despite their boasts of the MNLA having more fighters, because of superior firepower and the presence of foreign Islamist groups, like AQIM. An MNLA official in Nouakchott later clarified that they would only fight to remove the Islamists if "we are not the ones to fight the terrorists all alone...it is important that the outside powers help us, to even up the balance of power."
Timbuktu Deputy Mayor Sandy Haidara said of the actions that "it looks as if it is a direct reaction to the UNESCO decision." Ansar Dine's spokesman Sanda Ould Boumama then said that the group "will today destroy every mausoleum in the city. All of them, without exception. God is unique. All of this is "haram". We are all Muslims. UNESCO is what?" [We are acting] in the name of God." UNESCO's Executive Committee Chair Alissandra Cummins said that "this is tragic news for us all. I appeal to all those engaged in the conflict in Timbuktu to exercise their responsibility."
UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova called for a stop to the destructions, shortly before the announcement that Ansar Dine had ceased the destructions, according to a local journalist. Haidara's assessment was echoed by the media, which read the action as reacting to UNESCO's decision to put the sites on the endangered list. The chairwoman of UNESCO's 36th session, Yeleonor Mitrofanova, told the World Heritage Committee meeting in Saint Petersburg that she "appealed to all those engaged in the conflict in Timbuktu to exercise their responsibility – for the sake of future generations, spare the legacy of their past" A source reported to be affiliated to a local imam was quoted as saying that Ansar Dine had "raped Timbuktu today. It is a crime."
United Nations Representative for West Africa Said Djinnit said that the events "confirm the hold that terrorist groups have on Mali’s north, which worsens the humanitarian position of local people." United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman Martin Nesirky quoted Moon as saying: "Such attacks against cultural heritage sites are totally unjustified," while adding that "the secretary-general calls on all parties to exercise their responsibility to preserve the cultural heritage of Mali." The International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda warned "those involved in these criminal acts is clear: stop the destruction of the religious buildings now. This is a war crime which my office has authority to fully investigate." She cited Mali's accession to Article 8 of the Rome Statute that says any "deliberate attacks against undefended civilian buildings which are not military objectives are a war crime." The sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly also expressed concern about the regions UNESCO sites to the Director General of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the President of the African Union Commission and the Chair of ECOWAS.
The Organisation of the Islamic Conference issued a statement that read the sites were "part of the rich Islamic heritage of Mali and should not be allowed to be destroyed and put in harm's way by bigoted extremist elements." ECOWAS also issued a statement after a meeting in Ouagadougou that read: "They are asking the International Criminal Court to proceed with necessary investigations to identify those responsible for war crimes and to take the necessary action against them." It also called on Mali to ask the UN to support a military intervention against the groups in Azawad.
The Malian government called the actions "destructive fury," assimilable to "war crimes" and threatened action through Malian and international channels. Mali's Foreign Minister Sadio Lamine Sow said from Algiers that Mali would "do everything to recover our territory;" while the Culture and Tourism Minister Diallo Fadima Touré called on the UN on 1 July, to "take concrete steps to stop these crimes against the cultural heritage of my people." Protesters in Bamako rallied against the Islamist takeover on 4 July.
France's Communications Director and Chief Spokesperson at the Central Administration Bernard Valero said: "France condemns the deliberate destruction of the tombs of Muslim saints in the city of Timbuktu by an Islamist extremist group which controls this city. We appeal for an end to this violence and this intolerance. The systematic violation of these places of reverence and prayer, which for centuries have been part of the soul of this famed sub-Saharan city, constitutes an intolerable act." The Russia Foreign Ministry condemned the action as "barbarian. Such acts can only arouse indignation." The United States' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland also added that "the United States strongly condemns the destruction of the UNESCO world heritage sites in Timbuktu by Islamic militants. We call on all parties to protect Mali's heritage." Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba said at the General debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly that he rejected the attempt to secede, as well as the wanton destructions of the sites. Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra also called for an immediate international intervention to restore Bamako's writ; he was supported by Niger. It was also affirmed at the same forum by Ivory Coast, who had a similar external intervention during the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis, and former imperial overlord France's Francois Hollande who supported an African intervention.
The head of the Tombouctou Manuscripts Project at the University of Cape Town, Shamil Jeppie, said that the destruction was akin to that of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. "It's a real loss for people in the town, in the region and on the continent. Timbuktu was a center of Islamic learning, a very significant center — there is lots of internal and external evidence of this. But Ansar Dine is ignorant of this. For them, there is only one book and it's the Quran. All this other (Islamic) learning is inconsequential to them." The Chairman of the Malian Manuscript Foundation Michael Covitt, said from New York that the action led to "generations and generations of culture being destroyed." However, early estimates of the extent of the destruction were overstated. Timbuktu residents successfully saved more than 300,000 manuscripts by hiding or smuggling them out of Timbuktu. No more than 4,000 documents were lost or damaged when rebels set fires within the Ahmed Baba Institute, and all of them belonged to a set that had been copied by digitization. However, many of the preserved manuscripts were damaged in the process of rescuing and hiding them. In 2014 UNESCO appealed for assistance to conserve and restore the Timbuktu manuscripts and to continue making digital copies.
"Voice of America" reported that people in the city say the actions of Ansar Dine as unrelated to Islamic thought and teachings, but instead targeted at avenging the threats of the "international community" and the Western world-led War on Terror. Timbuktu MP in the National Assembly of Mali, Haïdara El Hadji Baba, said that "Ansar Dine’s real motivation in doing this was to defy the international community;” he cited the destructions as emanating after UNESCO's classification of the shrines as "in danger." He further warned that after Bensouda told the French media on 1 July that the actions could be called war crimes there could be more to come. "With its condemnations the international community is only intensifying Ansar Dine's desire to destroy." UNESCO's World Heritage Centre's Africa head, Lazare Eloundou Assomo, refused responsibility for the action in saying that it was "normal" for supranational bodies to denounce the destruction of what she termed "world heritage." She added: "Would you have UNESCO remain silent about this? No. It’s crucial that we declare that these sites are important to the entire world and it’s everyone’s responsibility to protect them." While Reuters was similarly critical of the move, it also cited Ansar Dine's Sanda Ould Boumama speaking to Radio France Internationale saying that "human beings cannot be elevated higher than God ... When the Prophet entered Mecca, he said that all the mausoleums should be destroyed. And that's what we're repeating."
Reconstruction.
Local masons have reconstructed many monuments in Timbuktu, and UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova visited the site and praised the Malian government.

Career.
Early life and high school.
Wong-Orantes is of Filipino-Chinese descent on her mother's side and of Mexican descent on her father's side. Both of her parents, Winnie Wong and Robert Orantes, were volleyball players. Her father also coached the Mizuno Long Beach volleyball club.
She was an accomplished beach volleyball player from a young age, partnering with Sara Hughes and appearing on "Volleyball" magazine covers at age 12, after winning a prestigious beach volleyball California tournament. She was the youngest female to ever earn an AAA rating in beach volleyball. She attended high school at Los Alamitos High School in Cypress, California, where as an indoor player, her position was setter where she led her Long Beach-based club team to a national title.
Due to her being considered undersized at 5'6", she was not heavily recruited coming out of high school by top volleyball schools. It wasn't until she was attending a high school club tournament, when the head coach got tired of so many balls dropping easily and asked her to put on a libero jersey. Nebraska head coach John Cook happened to be at the tournament and watched her play in her first ever match as libero. He saw potential in her, invited her for a visit to campus, where she eventually committed to play.
University of Nebraska.
She would complete her collegiate career at Nebraska in both beach and indoor volleyball. In indoor volleyball, she won several accolades including AVCA First Team All-American in 2016, Third Team All-American in 2015, was a two time Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2015 &amp; 2016, and finished her career as Nebraska's all-time career digs leader with 1,890. She helped her team win the 2015 NCAA National Championship.
USA National Team.
She played for the United States national team, in 2017, she won the Pan American gold medal, and the bronze medal at the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix.
In May 2021, she was named to the 18-player roster for the FIVB Volleyball Nations League tournament that was played in Rimini, Italy. It was the only major international competition before the Tokyo Olympics in July. She was named the best libero of the tournament after helping Team USA win its third straight gold medal.
On June 7, 2021, US National Team head coach Karch Kiraly announced she would be part of the 12-player Olympic roster for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. In her Olympic debut, Wong-Orantes led the Olympics in serve reception percentage, on the way to helping the USA capture a first-ever gold medal. For her efforts, she was named the "Best Libero" of the Olympics.

Africa-Italy Excellence Awards

The Africa-Italy Excellence Awards (AIEA), formerly known as Ghana-Italy Excellence Awards, is a cultural-diversity oriented award scheme aimed at celebrating exemplary African individuals for their significant difference in the African community in Italy and other European countries. The event brings to light notable Africans that have genuinely excelled in various spheres of life, hence contributing to the advancement of Africa from the diaspora. The Africa-Italy Excellence Awards is organized and powered by Divino Friends Organization.
Award Scheme.
Africa-Italy Excellence Awards (AIEA) was initially founded as Ghana-Italy Excellence Awards in 2008 of which the maiden event was organized in 2011 in Brescia, Italy. The maiden event was preceded by a similar event of such nature by the then Ghana Ambassador to Italy, H.E. Agyei Amoama, in 2007, after which it took on the brand name, "Ghana-Italy Excellence Awards", prior to the event in 2011. In the third occasion of the event in 2013, the award was re-branded to "Africa-Italy Excellence Awards" (AIEA) in order to extended the celebratory honour to other deserving African as well. The Africa-Italy Excellence Awards (AIEA) was officially endorsed in November 2013 by the European Parliament signed by President Martin Schulz, Roma Capitale, Brescia Municipality and UNAR, National Office Against Racial Discrimination of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. It has also been endorsed by His Excellency Mamadou Kamara Dèkamo, Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in Italy. The award does not only celebrates diversity and multiculturalism and the achievements of the contemporary and historical African-Diaspora communities in Italy and Europe but also pays tribute to the success of Africans across all walks of life: emphasizing achievement and highlighting inspirational role models in the fields of: Humanitarian, Arts and Culture, Business, Sports and Entertainment. The AIEA seeks to address a broad spectrum of issues affecting the modern African. 
How the Award Scheme Operates.
Each year, a committee responsible for reviewing the candidates for the AIEA is established and nomination of awardees are called for about 12 month prior to AIEA ceremony. The nominations are accepted based on an internal vetting process. The AIEA committee considers the activities of prospective nominees 12 months from date of nomination acceptance which makes up the first evaluation. A ballot by the committee is cast after which, the profile of qualified nominees are made public and also reviewed by an established Legal Affairs Committee composed of renowned experts in the fields of: Immigration, Economics and Social work. The Legal committee holds 55% of the votes and 45% is left with the general public.

Australian cricket team in the United Arab Emirates in 2018–19

The Australian cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates from September to October 2018 to play two Tests and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against Pakistan. Ahead of the Test series, there was a four-day practice match in Dubai.
In February 2018, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) looked at the possibility of hosting this series and New Zealand's tour to the UAE in Malaysia instead of the UAE, due to domestic Twenty20 fixture congestion in Sharjah. In May 2018, the PCB invited Australia to play the fixtures in Pakistan, but Cricket Australia said it would not allow matches to be moved there. In June 2018, the PCB and the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) agreed to play Pakistan's future matches in the UAE. 
In September 2018, both Mitchell Marsh and Josh Hazlewood were appointed joint vice-captains of the Australia Test cricket team. The following month, both Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey were appointed joint vice-captains of the Australia T20I cricket team.
During the second Test match, an extra T20I match for Australia against the United Arab Emirates was added to the tour itinerary. Australia were scheduled to play the UAE in a Twenty20 warm-up match before the T20I series against Pakistan, when the match was upgraded to a full T20I fixture. It was the first time that the UAE played a full T20I match against Australia. Australia won the one-off match by seven wickets.
Pakistan won the Test series 1–0, after the first match ended in a draw. Pakistan won the T20I series against Australia 3–0.
Squads.
After Pakistan's Test squad was named, Mohammad Hafeez was later added to the team. Imam-ul-Haq fractured his finger while fielding in the first match, and was ruled out of Pakistan's squad for the second Test. Peter Siddle was added to Australia's T20I squad as cover for Mitchell Starc.

Telefonica O2 UK Ltd v British Telecommunications plc

Telefonica O2 UK Ltd v British Telecommunications plc [2014] UKSC 42 is a UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Telefonica O2 UK Ltd argued that BT’s charges for connections and terminations were unlawful. BT’s Standard Interconnect Agreement was varied unilaterally in 2009 to change termination charges for 08 numbers, subject to a mobile operator’s right to object, and dispute resolution by Ofcom (unless both parties wanted something else). Under the new scheme, operators would be given charges varying by the amount the originating network charged to callers. If callers paid more, termination charges would go up. After Telefonica’s objection, Ofcom decided the changes would be allowed if ‘fair and reasonable’ as judged by three principles of (1) mobile network operators should recover costs of originating calls to relevant numbers (2) new charges should provide benefits to consumers, and not entail distortion of competition, and (3) new charges should be implemented as soon as practicable. Ofcom decided it was not shown that the new charges produced consumer benefits, and promote welfare, and so BT should not be allowed to introduce the new scheme.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal allowed BT to introduce the new scheme. The Court of Appeal stopped BT introducing the new scheme. BT appealed. 
Judgment.
Lord Sumption held that BT could introduce the new scheme. Ofcom rejected the scheme solely because of the welfare test, and it had not been shown BT’s new charges would produce consumer benefits. BT was entitled by contract to vary charges, unless inconsistent with Directive 2002/21 art 8, which included a need to ensure consumer benefits. There was no finding of a lack of consumer benefit, so Ofcom could not reject charges just because they might have adverse consumer consequences, without any reason to think they would. They applied an extreme precautionary principle to a dynamic and competitive market, at odds with the Directives’ market-oriented and permissive approach.
Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Toulson and Lord Hodge agreed.

Lemke House

The Lemke House (also "Landhaus Lemke" or Mies van der Rohe Haus ) on Oberseestraße 60 in the Berlin district of Alt-Hohenschönhausen is the last house designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Germany before his emigration to the United States in 1938. It was built in Bauhaus style at the beginning of the 1930s under the name Villa Lemke.
History.
In 1932, the manufacturer couple Martha and Karl Lemke bought a two-storey property on the street with access to the "". On the advice of an acquaintance, they contacted the renowned architect who was to carry out the construction. After several plans, mostly for a two-storey building, work began in the summer of 1932. The costs amounted to 16,000 Reichsmarks (purchasing power adjusted in today's currency: around 61,000 euros). In spring 1933 the Lemkes were able to move into their house. The L-shaped building is relatively simple and modest, but it also met the requirements of the childless couple.
The façade consists of red-coloured, charcoal-fired bricks which, together with the flat roof, make the house look peculiar. The furnishings are partly from the studio of Mies van der Rohe or were designed by his partner Lilly Reich. The Lemke couple lived in their villa for only a few years. In May 1945, after the occupation of Alt-Hohenschönhausen by the Red Army, the family was asked to leave the house as soon as possible. The surrounding area was declared a restricted area and the Villa Lemke was used as a garage and storage area.
Later on, some employees of the Stasi moved in and into the surrounding villas. This authority acquired the house in 1962 and made some serious changes to the house and garden. In 1977 the magistrate of Berlin put it on the district monument list.
As the house had visibly decayed by then, the first renovation work began in the 1980s, but without any notable success, as the funds made available were insufficient. Until Die Wende, the house was used as a laundry and canteen for the employees of the Ministry. The garden was partially concreted and used as a car park. In 1990, the district of Alt-Hohenschönhausen took over the property and house from the Ministry and officially renamed it Mies van der Rohe Haus.
The necessary renovation work followed in the years 2000 to 2002. Since 1994 a sculpture by the Berlin artist Ruth Baumann has been standing in the garden of the house. The title of the work is "Aufsicht um die Kante" (in English: "Surveillance around the edge"). Today, the house serves as an exhibition pavilion for modern art and attracts the lovers of Mies van der Rohe's architecture.

For her impressive performance throughout the tournament, Drews was merited as the Best Opposite and Most Valuable Player. 
2020-2021: JT Marvelous (JPN).
V1. In March 2020, Drews was rumoured to play the 2020–2021 season in Brazil with the team Minas Tênis Clube. In April 2020, JT Marvelous renewed Drews' contract for the 2020-2021 Japan V.League Division 1 (V1) and is set to defend its title after outbidding Minas for Drews' contract. The decision to stay in Japan also came after USA head coach Karch Kiraly advised Drews to opt for the shorter and more organized league to give more time in preparation for Tokyo 2021. Drews arrived in Japan on 22 September 2020.
On 17 October 2020, JT Marvelous won their first match of the season in the finals rematch against Okayama Seagulls. Drews led all scorers in their straight-sets victory: 22-2-42 hitting (52.4% hitting efficiency) and 1 ace for 23 points. The following day, 18 October 2020, Drews poured in 27 points in their triumph over comebacking Miyu Nagaoka's Hisamitsu Springs: 26-1-50 hitting (52.0% hitting efficiency) and 1 ace. JT suffered their first loss in the hands of NEC Red Rockets in 4 sets as Drews recorded 27 points from 25-4-54 hitting (46.3% hitting efficiency), 1 block and 1 ace. Drews was used sparingly in their 31 October 2020 match against Hitachi Rivale. Drews scored 10 points in their win against Ageo Medics on 1 November 2020 from 9-0-18 hitting (50% hitting efficiency) and 1 block. On 7 November 2020, Drews powered JT to a 5-set victory against Denso Airybees via 19-4-46 hitting (41.3% hitting efficiency) and 3 blocks. The next day, Drews pounded in 26 points against Victorina Himeji: 25-3-46 hitting (53.2% hitting efficiency) and 1 block. The following week, JT emerged against Kurobe AquaFairies behind Drews' 22 points: 21-4-44 hitting (47.7% hitting efficiency) and 1 block. 21 November 2020 saw Drews and JT overpowering PFU Bluecats in straight sets as Drews scored 12 points from 10-1-18 hitting (55.6% hitting efficiency), 1 block and 1 ace. On 28 November 2020, Drews showed might after scoring 16 points following 14-0-23 hitting (60.9% hitting efficiency), 1 block and 1 ace against Toyota Auto Body Queenseis. For their last match of the first leg, JT Marvelous fought a highly contested bout against league-leading Toray Arrows. Drews' 21 points from 20-1-46 hitting (43.5% hitting efficiency) and 1 block weren't enough to land JT to 1st at the end of the first round.
JT finished off Foluke Akinradewo and Hisamitsu Springs in straight sets to open their 2nd leg campaign in the league led by Drews' 24 points: 23-2-42 hitting (54.8% hitting efficiency) and 1 ace. The following day, JT obliterated Okayama Seagulls after Drews scored 21 points, all from 21-0-41 hitting (51.2% hitting efficiency). The match signified the last league game of the year.
At the end of the double round-robin regular round, Drews ranked 1st in points per set, 1st in back row attack rate, 2nd in scoring and 2nd in overall attack rate.
Drews scored 42 points as she led 2nd-ranked JT to a 5-set semifinal playoff win against NEC Red Rockets via a 5-set win on 20 February 2021. The following day, JT showed its mastery over Toray in high-stakes matches as they clinched their 3rd title in league history after beating them in 4 sets. Drews was named Best Opposite of the tournament as she scored 25 points in the finals. 
Empress Cup. JT participated in the 2020 edition of the Empress Cup. On 12 December 2020, Drews led all scorers to beat NEC Red Rockets in the quarterfinals.

Senior National Team.
2017.
2017 Women's Pan-American Volleyball Cup.
Drews entered the USA senior national volleyball team for the first time in 2017, having been handpicked by Karch Kiraly, widely regarded as one of the best coaches in professional volleyball, who returned as the head coach of the team that year after Rio Olympic Games in 2016. Kiraly brought Drews into Team USA's summer-long camp in Anaheim, California. When Drews joined the team, she was already behind many of the players who had been in the Team USA gym since May 1 as the Puerto Rican league playoffs went through mid-May. Drews debuted for the United States national team later that year. Used primarily as the opposite in the double-sub with just two match starts, Drews led Team USA in scoring in three (against Columbia, Mexico and Argentina) of its first five matches in its gold medal run at the 2017 Women's Pan-American Volleyball Cup in June.
2017 USA Volleyball Cup.
Drews led Team USA past fourth-ranked Brazil with a 21-point performance to open the 2017 USA Volleyball Cup in Anaheim on a Sunday evening. Drews powered down 16 kills on 38 swings against Brazil while adding four blocks and an ace over the course of the four sets, with final set a bonus set after the Americans won the first three sets 25–21, 25–14, 29–27. However, in the official three sets of the match, Drews was her most dominant having 14 kills on 26 attacks with just three errors to go with three blocks and an ace. And she was able to have such a break-out match on American soil with her family in the stands watching.“I think it has been awesome,” Drews said immediately after the Brazil match. “The longer I get into my career, the more moments like this will stand out when we do get to play on American soil and have our families here. USA has been awesome about having our families able to come to practice and they are here tonight.”
2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix.
Kiraly left Drews in Anaheim for the first rounds of the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix. Drews took advantage of being one of only two opposites in the two- and three-hour sessions in the gym back in Orange County.“When you only have two (opposites), you’re getting a ton, a ton of touches,” Drews said. “There are some benefits to being in the home group when the team is traveling because you get so many reps. I think being so new to this system I really wanted to take advantage of those reps and see if I could get a lot better.”The extra work paid off with a spot on the U.S. roster for the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix finals round. Although the U.S. did not win either of its Finals Round matches against Serbia and Italy, Drews came off the bench in both contests to provide a huge spark. Drews was the U.S.’ top scorer (16 points: 15 kills in 39 swings for a 38.46% hitting efficiency; and 1 ace) in a 3–1 loss to Italy. She racked up with 10 points (10/26 for a 38.46% hitting efficiency) in USA's faltered comeback attempt from being down 2 sets to none against Serbia. USA finished 5th at the final staging of the World Grand Prix, tied with Netherlands.
2017 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Grand Champions Cup.
Drews returned for duty as she joined the U.S. team for the 2017 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Grand Champions Cup. She started at opposite for all matches and top-scored in 2 occasions - 22 points vs. Japan and 12 points vs. Brazil. In its win over Korea, 25–22, 25–20, 25–16, Drews contributed 11 points on eight kills, two blocks and an ace. She helped USA claim the bronze medal for the tournament.
2018.
2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League.
In 2018, Drews joined the U.S. team in the inaugural 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League where they eventually won gold against Turkey (25-17, 22–25, 28–26, 15–25, 7-15).
2019.
2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League.
Drews returned for another round of duty for the U.S. team in the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League. During the preliminary rounds, she led the Best Attackers race with a 205-68-426 attacking card, good for 48.12% hitting efficiency. After advancing to the final round, Drews once again ranked first in the Best Attackers chart with a 69-18-132 attacking card, good for 52.27 hitting efficiency. She was the 2nd Best Scorer with 69 attacks, 4 blocks and 4 aces for 77 points, behind top scorer Liu Yanhan's (China) 79 points.
Annie Drews led Team USA with 23 points, including 21 kills on 41 attacks, one block and one ace against Poland in the finals pool play. Drews did not see action in the pool play match against Brazil to give way for Jordan Thompson. Drews scored 21 points in the semifinals against China to lead Team USA to victory. Drews had 16 kills on 31 swings, three aces and two blocks.
In the Gold Medal Match, Drews was named Most Valuable Player after leading USA to victory, including a team-high 33 points against Brazil in the title match. Drews hit 32/59 and added one block. The comeback concluded in high drama in the fifth set with an unusual ending. Although Brazil earned the first two-point cushion of the tiebreaking fifth set at 3–1, Team USA bounced back to take its first lead of the set at 5–4 with two Robinson kills after a Brazil service error. The Americans extended the advantage to three at 8–5 with a Drews kill, Robinson ace and Larson kill. Brazil closed to one at 10–9. Team USA went up 13–10 with kills from Drews and Haleigh Washington. Brazil saved two match points at 14–13. In a bold move, Coach Karch Kiraly called for a video challenge for net touch during the middle of match point and Team USA won the points as the video clearly showed Brazil touching the net antenna. After the win, Kiraly did not spare kind words for the tournament MVP Andrea Drews after the match“Wow, Annie. I don’t know how many points she had, but she was huge. Everyone was huge. What a great team win, fall down 2-0 against one of the greatest teams in the world, Brazil. Jordan Larson came in and gave us a great lift, Tori Dixon also. It was a total team win, 14-person plus here, all the other people in our program including the 14 battling in Peru. Total team effort. So much to be proud of. We got better as the match went along. We improved our blocking lineups, had a nice passing lineup in there. Lauren Carlini doing a really nice job of running our offense and distributing.”
2019 FIVB Women's Volleyball Intercontinental Olympic Qualification Tournament.
On 2–4 August, Drews competed with USA in the 2019 FIVB Women's Volleyball Intercontinental Olympic Qualifications Tournament (IOQT) in CenturyLink Center, Shreveport-Bossier City, United States. After matches against Kazakhstan (3-0), Bulgaria (3-2) and Argentina (3-0), USA qualified for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020. As a result of their second-place finish in the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup, USA's FIVB World Rankings points led them to become the 2nd best team in the world as of October 2019. This put them at Pool B during the Olympic Games in 2020.
2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup.
Drews was lined-up for another round of NT duties at the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup in Japan from September 14–29. Drews started at opposite for most of the time but also shared lineups with Karsta Lowe. In their first match against Kenya, Drews hit 12 attacks on 22 swings (54.45% hitting efficiency) and added 2 aces to top-score at 14 points. Drews hit 10 attacks on 23 swings (43.47% hitting efficiency), had a stuff block and an ace in their 3–0 win against the Netherlands. USA bagged another impressive straight sets victory against Brazil with Drews having 12 attacks on 27 swings (44.44% hitting efficiency) and 2 stuff blocks for 14 points. In their 3-set loss against eventual gold medalists China, Drews, used sparingly, contributed 6 kills on 12 swings (50% hitting efficiency).

South Korea women's national volleyball team head coach, Stefano Lavarini, gave praise to Drews' performance in the post-match interview saying:"We couldn’t put pressure on their service and the United States in the first two sets, but especially the second, played really strong and their attackers were almost unstoppable, most especially their incredible opposite Andrew Drews. You got Boskovic and Egonu and now I think she's the one to watch."Drews was the league's 17th Best Scorer (105 attacks, 9 blocks, and 9 aces) and 3rd Best Attacker (105-29-225 for a 46.67% hitting efficiency). Her performance merited the team and her a silver medal finish and a Best Opposite award.
2019 Women's NORCECA Volleyball Championship.
For the final round of 2019 national team duty, Drews was lined-up for the 2019 Women's NORCECA Volleyball Continental Championship held in San Juan, Puerto Rico from 8–13 October.

USA eventually won the match in straight sets as she added eight kills on 14 swings and a block for nine points. During the finals, Drews came in as a substitute on the second set for teammate Karsta Lowe in the opposite position.

New Zealand cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2018–19

The New Zealand cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates between October and December 2018 to play three Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20Is) matches against Pakistan. Originally, the tour was scheduled to have three Tests, five ODIs and one T20I match.
In February 2018, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) looked at the possibility of hosting this series and Australia's tour to the UAE in Malaysia instead of the UAE, due to domestic Twenty20 fixture congestion in Sharjah. In May 2018, the PCB invited New Zealand to play the fixtures in Pakistan. In June 2018, the PCB and the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) agreed to play Pakistan's future matches in the UAE. In July 2018, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) confirmed that they had declined the PCB's offer to play the T20I fixtures in Pakistan because of security concerns. Therefore, all the matches on the tour took place in the UAE as scheduled.
Pakistan won the T20I series 3–0, setting a new record for the most consecutive series wins in T20Is, with eleven. The ODI series was drawn 1–1, after the third match finished as a no result due to rain.
During the third Test, Pakistan's Mohammad Hafeez announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the conclusion of the match, to focus on limited-overs cricket. Hafeez said that the time was right to retire from Test cricket and that he was honoured to represent Pakistan in 55 Test matches, including captaining the side. In the same match, Pakistan's Yasir Shah set a new record for the fastest bowler to take 200 wickets in Tests. He achieved it in his 33rd Test, breaking an 82-year old record that was set by Clarrie Grimmett of Australia, who took his 200th wicket in his 36th match. New Zealand went on to win the Test series 2–1. It was New Zealand's first away Test series win against Pakistan since 1969.
Squads.
Ahead of the tour, Martin Guptill was ruled out of New Zealand's ODI and T20I squads with a calf injury. Corey Anderson, Glenn Phillips and Ajaz Patel were added to New Zealand's T20I squad before the start of the tour. Ahead of the ODI series, Lockie Ferguson, Ajaz Patel and George Worker were added to New Zealand's ODI squad. Todd Astle was ruled out of both the ODI and Test series with a knee injury with William Somerville replacing him in New Zealand's Test squad.

Following the death of Mieszko II Lambert, king of Poland, in 1034, and the exile of his, Casimir I the Restorer, to Kingdom of Hungary, the state had fallen into a period of destabilization within the Duchy of Poland, that led to the start of the 1038 Peasant Uprising. Seizing the opportunity, around 1038, the cup-bearer Miecław had formed the state in Masovia, declaring its independence from Poland, and started his own royal dynasty.
Casimir I the Restorer, duke of Poland, had returned to the country from his exile in 1939. He had formed an alliance with Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev, the leader of Kievan Rus', via the marriage of Maria Dobroniega with Casimir. Expecting the attack from Rus', Miecław had formed an alliance with Pomeranian and Yotvingian tribes. In the spring of 1041, he had begun the campaign against Polish forces. Miecław's forces had fought with the army lead by Casimir and Yaroslav, in the battle of Pobiedziska. The battle ended with a decisive Polish victory and destruction of Miecław's army and led to the signing of the truce between both sides.
The fighting had begun again in 1047, as Casimir I, together with Yaroslav, had organized the attack on Masovia, which lead to the battle of their forces against the forces of Miecław and Pomerelia. The location of the battle remains unknown in modern times, though it was known to the 11th-century historian, Gallus Anonymus, according to whom, it took place near the river, with the bluff edge. According to him, Miecław forces had 30 divisions of cavalry, while Casimir, 3 divisions. It is probable that he did not account for the forces of Yaroslav the Wise, and that both sides, in fact, had a similar number of forces. The battle was probably initiated by Casimir I, who hoped to win before the arrival of the Pomerelian army. The battle itself was fierce, with numerous casualties on Miecław's side. The battle ended with Polish victory, following which, Miecław's state was reincorporated into Poland. According to Gallus Anonymus, Miecław had died in the battle. However, according to Wincenty Kadłubek in his "Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae", he had escaped to Prussia, where he was murdered.

France Telecom SA v Commission

France Telecom SA v Commission (2009) C-202/07 is a European competition law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Wanadoo Interactive was part of France Telecom SA after a merger. The Commission found it to have set predatory prices ‘as part of a plan to pre-empt the market in high-speed internet access during a key phase in its development’. France Telecom argued that such a charge should only succeed if proven that the predator is capable of recouping the losses it incurs during its campaign. 
The Advocate General's Opinion was sympathetic to recoupment argument. 
Judgment.
The CJEU held that there is no requirement to prove that recouping losses is possible, and so there was abuse of a dominant position.

Spit of Nizhny Novgorod

The Spit of Nizhny Novgorod ( short name is the Spit or Strelka) is one of the main natural landmarks in the historical centre of Nizhny Novgorod. It is located at the confluence of the Oka and Volga rivers.
Description.
The Spit separates the Oka and the Volga. In the past, it was a port for cargo ships arriving and departing Nizhny Novgorod. The Spit is also the location of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.
There is the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on the Spit. The Strelka metro station was also launched in 2018.
History.
From the 16th to the 20th century.
In the times of the Russian Tsardom, the Spit (Strelka) was the center of the Strelitzky camp of Nizhny Novgorod Uyezd, thereby receiving its name. Later the river port began to form here. This place was convenient for the unloading and loading of cargo and merchant ships arriving in Nizhny Novgorod along the Oka and Volga. A low place, at the intersection of two rivers, became more profitable for the construction of berths than the high Nizhny Novgorod hill. "Siberian piers" were formed on the shore from the side of the Volga.
During the time of the Russian Empire, "St. Petersburg piers" from the Oka side were added to the piers on the Volga shore. A new stage in the development of the river port on the Spit was the transfer of the fair from Makariev in 1817. Since then, the freight turnover of waterways has become more than 70 million poods (31 million kilograms). In 1880, the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built on the Spit. Also it was called "New Fair". During the All-Russia Exhibition in 1896, there were built guest houses and exhibition pavilions. Also, the first tram was opened, connecting the city with the fair. This event completely transformed Strelka, making it one of the busiest places in Kanavinskaya Sloboda, which was not yet part of Nizhny Novgorod.
The Soviet period.
During the Soviet Union, there have been major changes in the territory of the Spit. February 5, 1918, the administration of wharves was established. In 1932 a large cargo port was built on this territory. Also, in the late 1930s, the destruction of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral began. On the site of the cathedral it was planned to build a giant lighthouse with a monument to Vladimir Lenin from above. However, only its roof and domes were dismantled. During the entire Soviet period it was used as a warehouse and communal housing for the port workers. During the World War II on the roof of the cathedral, instead of the central dome, an anti-aircraft machine gun was installed to repel Luftwaffe attacks on the port. The Spit's defense did not allow the Germans to bombing the port territory and the Oksky (Kanavinsky) bridge. After the war, the port began to increase cargo turnover and became one of the largest in the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, a network of underground anti-nuclear bunkers was built at the Spit. In 1983, the restoration of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral began.
Current Russia.
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the port on the Spit was privatized. The territory around it began to be built up by private buildings and garages. In the 90s, the city council and local residents did not care about the exterior of the Spit. The restoration of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was completed. In the early 2000s the situation changed. The construction of a microdistrict in the wasteland near the port began. In the beginning the microdistrict Sedmoe Nebo was built, a hypermarket of the same name opened a little later. The development of this territory was included in the general plan of the 70s. It was planned to build residential areas and a new highway on the embankment of the Volga. On the territory continued to build new houses, roads and other infrastructure. In the beginning of 2010 there were plans for the development of the territory for the trade and business center Strelka-City. However, in 2015 it became known that the territory of the Spit will be built stadium for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and territory around it will be completely reconstructed. In the same year the river port was transferred, and its functions were distributed between the towns of Kstovo, Bor and other. Near the stadium is the construction of the "Strelka" metro station. The station is named after the Spit (Strelka).
During the reconstruction in the former port were discovered lacy metal structures of the All-Russia Exhibition of 1896, which were transported to the Siberian pier and converted into warehouses in 1902. The townspeople advocated the preservation of these structures in the same place and the governor supported the citizens of Nizhny Novgorod. These structures are planned to be restored and used for other purposes. August 1, 2017 were demolished old concrete warehouses, built in the 30s in the Soviet period. They had no historical value. However, the media and liberal activists presented this information as if historical warehouses with lace structures were demolished.
On November 1, 2016, the construction of a highway on the Volga embankment from Strelka along the micro district Meshcherskoe Ozero began. Designing and commencement of construction also accompanied a scandal provoked by local residents. They were again supported by the media and liberals. The inhabitants considered this territory to be their immediate place of rest and walks, and also called it an ecological zone. However, this embankment was completely destroyed and littered. This did not correspond in any way to the residents' words about a full-fledged place for recreation. In addition, the project to build a road on the Volga embankment was developed in 1977 and approved in 2010.
Another discovery was the underground bunkers built during the Cold War, in the event of a nuclear strike. They were found in December 2016. Public proposals were made on their preservation and transformation into the Museum of the Cold War.

Deutsche Telekom AG v Commission

Deutsche Telekom AG v Commission (2010) C-280/08 is a European competition law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Deutsche Telekom AG claimed the Commission had wrongly found it abused its dominant position under TFEU article 102, in charging higher prices to access its local loop: the physical circuit connecting the network termination point at a subscriber's premises to the main distribution frame or equivalent facility in the fixed public telephone network. Under German law and the Telecommunications Directives, DT was required to give access to competitors. The Commission said it was charging competitors more than its own retail end-user customers. The margin between the wholesale access price and its retail prices was not enough to cover downstream costs. DT's prices were approved by the German telecomms regulator (RegTP). The Commission said once a margin squeeze was shown, it was unnecessary to assess the effects on competition. This was already an abuse. Deutsche Telekom argued there could be no abuse because its prices were approved by the Regulator.
The General Court upheld the Commission's decision. It said the abuse was an unfair ‘spread’ between wholesale and retail prices. Margin squeezing was a separate abuse from predatory pricing.
Judgment.
The CJEU upheld the General Court.

Louise L. Sloan

Louise Littig Sloan (May 31, 1898 – March 1, 1982) was an American ophthalmologist and vision scientist. She is credited for being a pioneer of the sub-division of clinical vision research, contributing more than 100 scientific articles in which she either authored or co-authored. Her most notable work was in the area of visual acuity testing where she developed and improved equipment. Sloan received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College in experimental psychology. She spent a short period of time in both Bryn Mawr's experimental psychology program as well as the Department of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. The majority of her career, however, was spent at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute where she directed the Wilmer Laboratory of Physiological Optics for 44 years. In 1971, Sloan was awarded the prestigious Edgar D. Tillyer Award by the Optical Society (OSA) for her many achievements in the field of vision.
Early life and education.
Sloan was born in Baltimore, Maryland on May 31, 1898. She was also raised in Baltimore where she attended the private, all girls' college-preparatory school, Bryn Mawr School. This is where she first was affectionately nicknamed "Sloanie" by her peers – a name that would follow her throughout her career. Sloan graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in 1916 where she received a scholarship for her studies in mathematics. Later in 1971, she also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Bryn Mawr School.
A year after graduating from Bryn Mawr School, Sloan continued her studies in 1917 at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In 1920, she graduated with a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College. Sloan then returned to Baltimore, Maryland to study as a graduate in the physics program at Johns Hopkins University. After her time at Johns Hopkins, Sloan headed back to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and eventually earned her doctorate (Ph.D.) in experimental psychology from Bryn Mawr College in 1926. During her time at Bryn Mawr College, she was mentored by Clarence Ferree and Gertrude Rand as she began her work in ophthalmology.
Career.
After receiving her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr College, Sloan continued to work for the institution as an instructor of experimental psychology until 1928. Following her two-year stint, she began work at Harvard Medical School as a research assistant in ophthalmology. In 1929, her previous professors at Bryn Mawr College, Clarence Ferree and Gertrude Rand, invited her to join the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University, where she directed the laboratory of physiological optics and ophthalmology until the end of her professional career in 1973.
Service in World War II.
In 1942, Sloan's time at Johns Hopkins's Wilmer Institute was halted for a period of time in which she worked for the Air Force's School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas as an ophthalmologist and vision research investigator. At first, Sloan declined the Air Force's job offer and didn't agree until her husband and frequent collaborator, William M. Rowland, was also offered a position.
During her time in San Antonio, Sloan focused her work on color vision and color vision testing. It was at this time that she developed the Sloan color vision test which is used by the Air Force, as well as the Farnsworth Lantern Test which is used by the Navy. This work gave her the respected title of a "color vision authority." In 1945, she concluded her work with the Air Force and returned to Johns Hopkins Medical School and Hospital.
Research and publications.
Sloan contributed greatly to the scientific community, with over a hundred authored and co-authored articles in a number of research areas. One of the most prominent articles in her early years of research was based on a 1936 study. This article discussed an idiopathic macular disease which has been identified as central serous retinopathy. In the study, Sloan conducted "comparative determinations of the light minimum" of the investigated eyes, in the process devising a novel method we now term static perimetry. In addition, the tests for impairments in visual function aided the development of diagnosing macropsia, micropsia, and metamorphopsia. Some of her other significant works in the field ophthalmology included a study, in 1950, on threshold gradients of rods and cones in the eye. This study involved an experimental procedure that measured "the decrease in thresholds during adaptation to darkness or to a low brightness level after previous adaptation of the eye to a high brightness," which allowed threshold reductions in rods and cones to be measured separately from one another. Another important research involved experiments in red-green color blindness patients. Sloan also contributed greatly to the creation of the First International Standard for Visual Field Testing committee, where she represented the American optics and visual physiology committee.
Sloan letters.
Among the various contributions made by Sloan to ophthalmologic and optical research, her most well-known work is the creation of the Sloan letters, used to test visual acuity. These ten optotypes, according to Sloan, were specifically chosen from capital letters of the alphabet in an article written in 1959, in order to reduce existing inefficiencies present in other visual acuity test charts. The set consists of the letters Z, N, H, R, V, K, D, C, O, and S, chosen for their qualities of consisting of horizontal, vertical, curved, and slanted lines, which helps perform "subjective tests for determination of the error of refraction." Compared to the previous Snellen Chart letters, Sloan letters do not have serifs, although they do follow the traditional principle that the "overall height and width are five times the width of the strokes."
Sloan letters are commonly used in more modern visual acuity tests, such as the LogMAR chart.
Personal life.
Sloan was married to William M. Rowland who was a private-practicing ophthalmologist in Baltimore, Maryland. The couple often collaborated on research and projects related to ophthalmology. Louise Littig Sloan passed away from an unspecified "long, debilitating illness" on March 1, 1982 at 83 years old.
Legacy.
Sloan's lifetime of work in the area of visual acuity testing continues to have many longstanding applications to the work done in the field today. From her development of the Lantern Test to the Sloan Letters, she stands as an important figure in America's history of ophthalmology and vision science. Sloan is remembered by her colleagues, friends, students and patients for her “boundless enthusiasm, stimulating companionship, and kind counsel and encouragement.”
Medical and scientific societies.
Sloan was a member of the following organizations:

Vilhelmína Lever

Vilhelmína Lever (1 March 1802 – 19 June 1879) was an Icelandic shopkeeper and restaurateur from Akureyri in northern Iceland. She is remembered for voting in the municipal elections in 1863 and 1866 before women were officially given voting rights.
Biography.
Born on 1 March 1802, Vilhelmína Lever was the daughter of Hans Vilhelms Lever, a merchant, and his wife Þuríður Sigfúsdóttir. She married Thord Daníelsson but obtained a divorce in 1824, becoming the first woman in Iceland to apply for a divorce. She bought a plot of land in Akureyri in 1834, built a small house and opened a shop in 1835. 
After spending a few years in Krossanes, she returned to Akureyri in 1852 to run a shop combined with a restaurant. In 1861, she opened a restaurant in the Oddeyri district of Akureyri. She ran it for years, gaining the nickname "Vertshús-Mína" or Tavern-Mina.
New regulations in Danish stated that the town council could be elected by "alle fuldmyndige Mænd" (all men who have reached their majority) who had lived in the town for two years and paid municipal dues. Assuming "mænd" meant all people (as in Icelandic) and not just men, Vilhelmína voted in the municipal elections in both 1863 and 1866.
Later Vilhelmína lived in Nonnahús (Nonni's House), Akureyri's oldest house. She died in Akureyri on 19 June 1879.

Grant Schreiber (born Cape Town 1967) is a South African publisher, author and editor. He is the founding editor of Real Leaders, a leadership magazine that focuses exclusively on sustainability and ethical business. He has held the title of managing editor since the launch of the magazine in 2009.
He is known for interviewing influential figures and celebrities such as Sharon Stone, Desmond Tutu, Sara Blakely, Sheryl Sandberg and Warren Buffett. Originally started as a members-only magazine for members of the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) Schreiber relaunched Real Leaders as a mainstream title at Barnes &amp; Noble, New York in September 2017.
He is the author of a series of best-selling books in South Africa, that explore dark subject matter with humor, the first of which was: "Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Kak?" in 2007 and "Complete Kak" in 2011. He cofounded a book imprint in 2002 called Two Dogs and collaborated with South African authors in writing books for men. The books started a trend in South Africa, of books that tackled serious social issues with irreverent humor.
In 2003 he was asked by the South African Government to redesign the new parliamentary mace, that replaced the old version used by the apartheid government. His artistic work on the mace is seen as a symbolic break with the past and a reinterpretation of national imagery, more suited to the post-1994 democratic elections, when Nelson Mandela was voted in as president.
He was interviewed by Forbes in 2017. His opinions and writing have appeared in The New York Public Library, Inc. and The Baltimore Sun

Marlfield Distillery

Marlfield Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery which operated in the village of Marlfield, just outside of Clonmel, Ireland between approximately 1817 and 1856.
The majority of the distillery buildings have since been demolished, aside from those adjacent to Distillery House, which is still extant.
History.
The distillery was established in 1817 by a business consortium which included members of the Steins, a noted family of distillers from Scotland. The firm traded as “John Stein &amp; Co.”, named for the principal of the firm, though operations at the distillery were overseen by John’s brother Andrew. Others likely to have had a stake in the firm, though not necessarily when it was founded, include John Brown, John Murray, and Richard Sparrow.
The distillery was located in an old mill which the firm had converted for distilling purposes. In 1818, it is recorded as producing 8,268 proof gallons per week using a 500 gallon pot still. By 1826, output had risen to 396,599 gallons per annum.
In 1834, the partnership was dissolved, with John Murray, one of the partners assuming control of the company, which subsequently traded under “John Murray &amp; Co.”
In 1836, Marlfield Whiskey is recorded as selling in Clonmel Market for about 7 shillings a gallon.
By 1838, the distillery then thriving, though output figures are not available, is known to have employed 150 people and consumed nearly 90,000 barrels of malt barley per annum.
In 1846, during the height of the Great Famine, the Distillery is noted to have sold Indian Corn Meal to its labourers at 14 pence a stone, at a time when others were selling it to the public at 2 shillings (24 pence) a stone.
In 1850, the distillery was taken over by members of the famous Jameson distilling dynasty from Dublin. Henry Jameson, the son of John Jameson founder of Jameson Irish Whiskey, who resided in Marlfield for some time, and is mentioned in several newspaper articles in connection with the distillery at the time likely took charge of the distillery at that point. However, the business appears to have continued to trade under the name of “John Murray &amp; Co.”
In August 1856, it was announced that the distillery was to be dismantled, the materials sold, and the buildings put up for lease. The plant and equipment, which included pumps, two pot stills, a Coffey still, vats, 15 draft horses, and Berkshire breeding sows, were advertised for sale by private contract in August 1856. A separate newspaper advert from the time listed the buildings for lease, with corn stores and paper milling being given as suggested uses for the buildings. The distillery’s fire engine was purchased by the local Corporation of Clonmel.
Marlfield Whiskey continued to be sold locally for a number of years after the distillery closed, while the remaining stocks of whiskey were wound down.

Born at Trafalgar Park in Wiltshire, he was the son of Horatio Nelson, 3rd Earl Nelson of Trafalgar and of Merton and Lady Mary Jane Diana (née Agar, 1823–1904).
A Roman Catholic through his mother, Lady Mary Nelson, in 1914 he had Standlynch Church rededicated to Mary Queen of Angels and St. Michael and All the Angels, served by a resident priest. In 1930, Lord Nelson purchased the panelling of the Captain's Cabin of , built in 1821, which was being broken up, installing the panelling in the main top floor room at Trafalgar Park.
During World War II the North and South Wings of Trafalgar Park, the family seat, were occupied by tenants with Thomas Nelson and his younger brother Edward Agar Nelson living in the main house. In 1946 he complained to the Attlee Government that much of the £5,000 a year pension granted to his ancestor the 1st Earl was being spent on maintaining the house. The Treasury proposed to create a Bill ending the pension but which would allow the Nelson family to sell the estate, which had been purchased with money raised by public subscription for the descendants of Horatio Nelson. The Bill ending the pension was passed in 1947 after the death of Thomas Nelson and Trafalgar Park was sold in 1948 by Edward Agar Nelson, the 5th Earl.
Thomas Nelson died in September 1947 at age 89. He never married and on his death the title passed to his younger brother Edward, the 5th Earl Nelson.

Augustin Hacquard

Augustin Prosper Hacquard (18 September 1860 – 4 April 1901) was a French missionary who became Apostolic Vicar of Sahara and Sudan in 1898. 
After several years in Algeria, including a short period as head of the Armed Brothers of the Sahara, he was appointed to the French Sudan, the newly acquired territories along the Niger River to the east of Senegal, where he established several mission stations. The missionaries founded several villages, where they settled former slaves.
Early years (1860–84).
Augustin Prosper Hacquard was born on 18 September 1860 in Albestroff, Moselle, France.
He attended primary school, then in 1873 entered the minor seminary of Pont-à-Mousson, and in 1877 went on to the major seminary of Nancy.
On 27 June 1878 he decided to seek admission to the White Fathers novitiate at Maison-Carrée in Algiers.
His parents would not give their permission, but he left anyway and embarked from Marseille for Algiers on 1 September 1878.
At the Maison-Carrée the program included prayer, spiritual formation and the Arabic language.
In September 1881 Hacquard was appointed a teacher at the Collège de Carthage and taught there for two years before resuming his theological studies in 1883.
Hacquard was strongly built, bearded, lively and very brave.
He learned to speak Arabic fluently.
Priest in Algiers (1884–91).
Hacquard was ordained a priest of the White Fathers on 8 September 1884.
He was appointed a teacher of humanities at the minor seminary of Saint Eugène in Algiers.
In 1886 Cardinal Charles Lavigerie put him in charge of the baccalaureate class and told him to prepare himself for his university entrance exam, which he passed first of 47 candidates in September 1886.
He wanted to go with the next caravan to the Great Lakes led by Bishop John Joseph Hirth, but was told by the Cardinal that it would be a good test for him to wait a few years.
He was appointed Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of Saint Eugène, a demanding job.
On 28 July 1887 he obtained his degree from the faculty of Aix-en-Provence and was told by the Cardinal to prepare his doctorate on the ancient Christian Africa.
Armed brothers of the Sahara (1891–93).
A group of missionaries who tried to cross the Sahara were massacred in 1877, and another group was massacred in 1881.
The official Flatters expedition was also destroyed in 1881.
After this the authorities prohibited the White Fathers from trying to enter the southern Sahara.
However, in 1891 the Cardinal appointed Hacquard to Biskra as first superior of a new religious and military institute, the "Frères armés du Sahara" (Armed Brothers of the Sahara).
The main role of these volunteers would be to receive slaves escaped from the caravans.
The lay brothers would give the slaves refuges and promote agriculture.
A barrack was built in Biskra for the brotherhood, who wore a uniform with elements from the garb of the crusaders and the French North African cavalry.
The volunteers were expected to provide examples to the "heathens" of ascetic, martial Christian virility.
The work was hard and spartan, but there were many volunteers attracted by the romance of the desert.
Hacquard was very selective and out of 1,700 applications chose only 30, a number that soon dropped to 22.
In October he and six brothers were posted to Ouargla.
One of the 22 Armed Brothers, the layman Maurice Delafosse, was later a member of the Temporary Slavery Commission of the League of Nations.
The Armed Brothers of the Sahara were portrayed in the international press as the Cardinal's private army.
The governor general of Algeria asked Lavigerie to disband them.
He complied in October 1892.
Hacquard remained in charge of the mission in Ouargla until 21 July 1893, when he was sent to Maison Carrée.
Tuareg exploration (1893–94).
On 10 September 1893 Hacquard and François Ménoret of the White Fathers were appointed to serve on a mission of exploration to Tuareg country led by Gaston Méry.
The other European members were Albert Bonnel de Mézières() and Antoine Bernard d'Attanoux, a former officer who had become editor of "Le Temps".
The mission set out in October 1893.
The leadership of the mission had not been well defined, and the members quarrelled.
Méry did not want to carry books or the geologist's equipment and would not listen to the advice of more experienced travellers.
He was emotionally unstable and had a violent temper.
He shot a guide in the arm during an argument, and killed his interpreter's dog after it refused a command to attack a gazelle.
At one point he threatened to blow everyone up with boxes of blasting powder.
At Touggourt Méry announced that he would dispense with guides.
The other members of the mission decided that they could not continue in these circumstances.
Méry left the expedition and returned to France.
On his return to Biskra Hacquard was offered command of the mission, but refused, and Antoine Bernard d'Attanoux took the position.
The mission left again on 12 January 1894.
It went south from Biskra past Touggourt and Ouargla, past Aïn Taïba, El Biodh and Temassinin, and along the Ighargharen valley to Lake Menghough.
Méry decided to return to the desert once more, at his own expense.
He left Toulouse in January 1894 with a companion named Moulai and followed the trail of the Attanoux mission which he rejoined at Ain-Taieba.
The two explorers fell out again, and Méry was repatriated a second time.
The mission returned to Algiers on 17 April 1894, and later that month Hacquard participated in a General Chapter of the White Fathers at Maison-Carrée.
After returning to France Hacquard lectured about the Tuareg's in Lille and Paris.
Ségou and Timbuktu (1894–95).
Around this time the French moved inland from the coast of Senegal into what is now Mali and Burkino Faso, reached Timbuktu in 1894 and declared a protectorate over the French Sudan in 1895.
Lavigerie's successor as Apostolic Vicar of the Sahara and Sudan, Bishop Anatole-Joseph Toulotte, decided to organize a mission in the Sudan, and in 1894 was given permission to enter the Sudan from Senegal with a mission headed by a Frenchman.
The Ministry of the Colonies issued the authorization on 9 November 1894 and on 25 December 1894 the first caravan, four White Fathers, left from Marseille.
Hacquard was the leader of the group.
They arrived in Dakar and went by train to Saint-Louis, where they stayed until 16 January 1895.
The missionaries than travelled by boat up the Senegal River and reached Kayes on 12 February 1895.
They continued by land to Ségou on the Niger River, which they reached on 1 April 1895.
The White Father were committed to eliminating slavery.
The Congregation of the Holy Spirit mission at Kita gave the first group of White Fathers two orphans.
They often bought slaves, and also received refugees.
A large caravan was stopped at Ségou just after the White Fathers arrived. 
Hacquard offered to look after the freed slaves and to give them huts, clothes, tools, seed and grain until the next harvest.
For several years the mission operated a liberty village near Ségou.
On 30 April 1895 Hacquard and Father Dupuis took a boat down the Niger to Kabara, the port of Timbuktu, which they reached on 21 May 1895.
They quickly established a mission where Hacquard ran the pharmacy and Dupuis taught about 15 children.
The mission in Timbuktu did not last long.
Niger navigation and France (1896–97).
Hacquard was invited by Émile Auguste Léon Hourst(), commander of the French flotilla of the Niger, on a mission to investigate the hydrology of the river.
The mission left Kabara on 22 January 1896.
At Gao a large payment to the local ruler, Madidou, was needed to gain permission to continue.
The mission reached Say on 7 April 1896, and established a fortified base on a wooded island while waiting for the water levels to rise enough for them to proceed. 
They started again on 15 September 1896, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and returned via Dahomey and Dakar to report to the Governor General.
Hacquard went on from Dakar to France.
The Niger voyage let Hacquard see for himself the conditions and the prospects for mission activity in the lands beside the Niger.
His account of the journey appeared in "Les Missions catholiques" in 1897.
Hacquard denied accusations that he was an explorer working for the government, saying, "I am more ambitious than that, I am a missionary."
Hacquard described the effect of famine years in the region,
On 31 March 1897 Hacquard told the Anti-Slavery Society in Paris, "... we have sought to follow the footsteps of our predecessors the Fathers of the Holy Spirit. ...We have adopted these poor victims, the slaves, and we now have Christian villages with several hundred inhabitants."
In 1897 Hacquard persuaded the French Anti-Slavery Society to make liberty villages a priority.
Ten of these villages were eventually founded by the missions in the Sudan.
The government also ran liberty villages for ex-slaves, and used the villagers as laborers.
The White Fathers criticized these villages, and Hacquard suggested that the women in them often simply became concubines.
The villages founded by the White Fathers were distant from government posts where possible.
Hacquard stayed in France and Algeria for almost 11 months writing, lecturing, and preparing a double caravan of White Fathers and White Sisters for departure to the Sudan.
In France he was chaplain to a community of about 100 nuns of the Congregation of Our Lady of Sion.
He left Marseille on 25 October 1897 with eight nuns, two priests and two monks, and reached Ségou on 1 January 1898.
Last years (1898–1901).
On 19 January 1898 Hacquard was appointed Titular Bishop of Rusicade and Apostolic Vicar of Sahara and Sudan. He succeeded Toulotte in the latter role. He was in Ségou when he was informed of the appointment. In a letter he wrote on 11 April 1898 he downplayed the significance of the promotion, noting that there was no use for ceremony at the mission and everyone shared the same food. He returned to France, arrived in Marseille on 17 July 1898 and received his episcopal consecration on 28 August 1898 in the chapel of the Dames de Sion, in Paris. He visited Rome to meet the Pope and the Cardinal Prefect of the "Propaganda Fide".
Hacquard left Marseille for the last time on 25 October 1898 with three new priests, two brothers and three sisters, and reached Ségou on 10 January 1899.
After a month he set out to visit part of his huge vicariate.
Between 24 February 1899 and 12 April 1899 he visited the Bobo, Samo and Mossi countries south of the river and spent a few days in Ouagadougou. He made another trip to the Mossi country from December 1899 to March 1900. The missionaries had difficulty making converts in Bamako and Kayes, where most people were Muslim. In Ségou and Kita they did better, but Islam was growing fast there too. Their best prospects were in the south among the Mossi, Bobo and Minianka people, who had little contact with Islam.
However, they were handicapped by lack of money and the insistence of the authorities that they keep their northern missions open.
A mission had been founded at Bamako in 1897.
Hacquard founded mission stations among the Mossi and Gurma people of what is now Burkina Faso. He contacted the British authorities, and gained their permission to start a mission station in the north of the Gold Coast (now Ghana). He noted that the Gold Coast could provide a refuge if the anti-clerical French administration made it impossible for missionaries to work in the French protectorate. The missions took in many children, whether as pawns or purchases.
There was a famine in 1899 when the price of grain rose tenfold.
The missions at Segu and Banankuru purchased more than 100 people, all that they could afford.
The missionaries were generally treated well by the soldiers, many of whom came from strictly religious families. The missions were useful to the authorities since they educated the local people to become clerks, minor officials and teachers, ran orphanages and supplied nurses and chaplains for the hospitals.
However, there were tensions. The missionaries maintained their independence from the state, often taught in local languages rather than French and could not accept the relaxed attitudes of the military to sex and slavery.
Hacquard made another trip to Djenné, Bandiagara, Lake Débo and Dori in November–December 1900.
He died in an accident on 4 April 1901 while bathing in the Niger at Ségou.

St John's College, Morpeth

St John's College, Morpeth, known colloquially as the "Poor Man's College, Armidale", was opened in Armidale in 1898 as a theological college to train clergy to serve in the Church of England in Australia. It moved to Morpeth in 1926 and closed in 2006.
Armidale.
St John's College was founded in 1898 by the then Bishop of Grafton and Armidale, Arthur Green. It was part-funded by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. At the time the college was established, the only other theological colleges were Moore College in Sydney, which was evangelical, and Trinity College, Melbourne, which only admitted university graduates. Green deliberately intended it to be a 'poor man's college'. 
The college building was designed by the Australian ecclesiastical architect John Horbury Hunt. (Hunt had designed the cathedrals in Grafton, Newcastle and Armidale.) The bishop was the first warden and did all the lecturing; there were just five students. The college was dedicated in 1899 by Saumarez Smith, Archbishop of Sydney. Three further wardens followed in short succession, adding new buildings. The visionary churchman Ernest Burgmann was appointed Warden in 1918, which was to be transformative for the college. On the invitation of Reginald Stephen, Bishop of Newcastle, in 1925 Burgmann moved the college to Morpeth. The Armidale college buildings now form part of the New England Girls' School. A stained glass window that had gone with the college to Morpeth was returned to NEGS in 2012.
Morpeth.
In 1821, Lt Edward Close was granted 2,600 acres of land at Morpeth by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Close built a house, Closebourne House. In 1849 he sold Closebourne House to the Bishop of Newcastle, who renamed it Bishopscourt and built a replacement house next to it which he called Morpeth House. After 1869, Morpeth House went through various occupations and ownerships, before being acquired in 1925 as the site for the relocated college. Additional buildings were designed by the ecclesiastical architect Louis Williams. 
The college bell came from Raymond Terrace, and was the ship's bell on the Paddle Steamer "Ceres", which had been wrecked on her maiden voyage in 1836. In 1942 and 1943 the college exchanged premises with the Newcastle Church of England Girls' Grammar School in order to put the girls beyond the possible reach of Japanese bombardment of Newcastle.
Chapel.
The chapel was originally within Morpeth House; in 1941 a simple chapel was built, with colonial stone from a derelict building in Morpeth. 
At first, the chapel had a French harmonium. In 1965 a Norman and Beard pipe organ was installed. It was acquired from the Congregational Church in Maitland. In 1981 it was removed and in 1984 installed in a private residence in Singleton. Its replacement was a 1982 organ by Fr John Hamer-Howarth. Much of the organ is assembled from older instruments: the Open Diapason is by Palmer; the Bourdon from Croydon; the Stopped Diapason by Robson; and the Block Flute, the principal and the Fifteenth from the Methodist Chapel in Sutton-on-Soar, Northamptonshire. The main chest is from the Methodist Church in Homebush. The casework is Fr Hamer-Howarth's own work.
Closure.
The college closed in 2006. During the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the college was the subject of adverse comment in respect of clerical sexual abuse. 
Theological education for the Diocese of Newcastle is now provided by Trinity College, Melbourne.
The college and its grounds are now a retirement village, managed by Lendlease. The former Morpeth House is now the social centre, and the former chapel is a multi-use hall.
College prayers.
At the time of the college's jubilee in 1948 the collect was in the following form:
By the time the college closed there was a new form of collect.
Wardens and principals.
The college was initially led by a warden; the title was changed to 'principal' in the 1980s.

2018 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series

The 2018 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series is the tenth Racecar Euro Series season, and the sixth under the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series branding. The season consisted of six meetings – with two races at each meeting – starting on 14 April at Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia, and ending on 21 October at Circuit Zolder in Belgium. Alon Day and Thomas Ferrando entered the season as the defending champion in Elite 1 and Elite 2 respectively.
In the Elite 1 class, Alon Day successfully defended his Elite 1 title, winning the championship by 28 points over Frédéric Gabillon. In the Elite 2 class, Ulysse Delsaux scored his first NASCAR Euro Series title, ahead of Go Fas Racing's Florian Venturi by six points. RDV Compétition won the team's championship title, while Toyota won their first Euro Series manufacturer's title.
Teams and drivers.
NASCAR released the entry list for the teams participating on 15 March 2018.
Season report.
In the Elite 1 class, the championship was closely contested by defending champion Alon Day of CAAL Racing and Frédéric Gabillon of RDV Compétition. 
Day initially got the upper hand after winning the first three races of the season, but his championship campaign received a setback when he got disqualified at the second race in Franciacorta due to technical infringements during post-race inspection. Gabillon took the championship lead soon after and would lead the championship by the time the playoffs begin at Hockenheim. Problems for both Gabillon and Day at Hockenheim, however, allowed Lucas Lasserre of Mishumotors and rookie Loris Hezemans of Hendriks Motorsport to close up the gap, setting up a four-way battle for the title at Zolder. Ultimately, retirements for both Lasserre and Hezemans during the first race of the Zolder race meet effectively eliminated them from title contention, and with Gabillon unable to match Day's pace for the weekend, Alon Day was crowned champion after winning his seventh race of the season at the final race of the season. Alon Day's seven race wins set a new record for the most races won in a single Elite 1 Euro Series season, one short of Stienes Longin's overall record of 8 wins in the 2016 Elite 2 season. Gabillon won two races (Brands Hatch 1 and Tours 1), while Lassere (Franciacorta 2), Hezemans (Hockenheim 1), and 2015 Elite 2 champion Gianmarco Ercoli (Brands Hatch 2) scored one race win each.
In the Elite 2 class, the championship was closely fought between four drivers: Ulysse Delsaux of RDV Compétition, defending champions Wilfried Boucenna of Knauf 
Racing, Florian Venturi of Go Fas Racing, and the returning Guillaume Deflandre for Memphis Racing. Boucenna initially took the championship lead after sweeping both races at Valencia. However, problems for Boucenna at Franciacorta Race 2 allowed Deflandre to caught up to him, and further problems for Boucenna at the first race of Brands Hatch race meet allowed Deflandre to take the championship lead. Delsaux then sweeps the Tours race week to take the lead in the championship, and looks set to sweep the Hockenheim race week had a tire failure in the second race at Hockenheim didn't force him to retire from the race. This allowed Deflandre, Boucenna, and a resurgent Venturi to set up a four-way battle for the championship. A costly retirement at race 1 of Zolder ultimately took out Deflandre of the championship hunt, and while Venturi was able to score a win and a second-place finish at Zolder, Delsaux had enough gap between him and Venturi to take the championship with a third-place finish at the final race of the season. Delsaux also scored the most race wins of the season with three (Tours sweep and Hockenheim 1). Venturi (Brands Hatch 2 and Zolder 1), Boucenna (Valencia sweep), Deflandre (Brands Hatch 1 and Hockenheim 2), and PK Carsport's Guillaume Dumarey (Franciacorta 2 and Zolder 2) scored two race wins, while Brazilian Felipe Rabello (Franciacorta 1) scored one race win.
In the team's championship, with both of their drivers being in the championship hunt for the entirety of the season, RDV Compétition's #3 team comfortably won team's title, finishing 107 points clear of Knauf Racing's #37 team. New teams Memphis Racing and Go Fas Racing scored an impressive third and fourth-place finish, while Knauf Racing's #73 team completes the top five in the team's championship.
In the manufacturer's championship, Toyota claimed their first Euro Series manufacturers title, becoming the first manufacturer to successfully topple Chevrolet from the top spot. Toyota's championship hopes were helped by the decision made by Alon Day's team CAAL Racing to switch manufacturers from Chevrolet to Toyota mid-season, giving Toyota the crucial edge they need to secure the manufacturer's title.
Notably, this season saw a noticeable increase in attention from the other side of the Atlantic. Both former Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion Bobby Labonte and current Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series team Go Fas Racing made their Euro Series debuts in 2018. Labonte, in his first season as a full-time driver since 2011, scored a second-place finish at the second race in Tours (the only oval race meet in the schedule) and would finish 14th in the standings with 1 Top 5 and 3 Top 10 finishes. Go Fas impressed in their debut season, finishing fourth in the team's championship with their Elite 2 driver Florian Venturi being in the championship hunt for much of the season. Truck Series regular Jennifer Jo Cobb also made an appearance at Valencia, driving for Racing Total in the Elite 2 class, a decision that ultimately allowed Racing Total driver Justin Kunz to make a Truck Series start for Jo Cobb's Truck team in Mosport. Pinty's Series driver Jean-François Dumoulin and K&amp;N East driver Dale Quarterley made an appearance at Zolder as part of a driver exchange program that the Euro Series ran in conjunction with Pinty's Series and K&amp;N East. Former B. J. McLeod Motorsports driver Stephen Young also made an appearance this season, driving for Racing Total's #10 entry at Tours in the Elite 2 class.

Padmini (film)

Padmini is an upcoming Indian Malayalam-language biographical drama film written and directed by Susmesh Chandroth in his directorial debut. The film is about T.K. Padmini, one of the female painters from Kerala, with Anumol portraying her. It also stars Irshad, Sanju Sivram, Shaju Sreedhar, and Priyanandanan.
Synopsis.
Padmini is a biopic on the life of T. K. Padmini, a woman painter from India. Born in 1940, in a remote village in the Malabar District of Madras Presidency, she grew up in an orthodox environment where girls were never supposed to get higher education or jobs. Padmini had lost her father at a young age and was brought up by her uncle T. K. Divakara Menon, who recognized her artistic talent and encouraged her to pursue higher studies in Art. Fighting against many odds, she managed to join the Madras College of Arts and Crafts, where the renowned artist K. C. S. Panicker became her mentor. She married her classmate K. Damodaran, who encouraged and supported her in her artistic pursuits. Her works were acclaimed critically, and at a very young age, she came to be regarded as one of the most promising artists of her generation. She conducted exhibitions in the major cities of India and won various prestigious awards and captured the imagination of art lovers of the country in a short span of six or seven years, before her untimely death in 1969. At a time when ideas like feminism were not in vogue in the field of Indian art, Padmini was far ahead of her times with her bold depiction of the condition of women and her daring portrayal of the female body, breaking the barriers of orthodoxy.
The film narrates the story of Padmini’s artistic journey from a village girl breaking free from the constraints imposed by a conservative society to become a path-breaking artist of her times.

Singapore (horse)

Singapore (1927 – after 1946) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Unraced as a two-year-old, he was beaten in his first three starts in 1930 before winning a race at Sandown Park. He continued his progress and recorded his biggest win in September when he took the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. As a four-year-old he appeared to be a very unlucky loser when narrowly beaten in the Ascot Gold Cup and was an easy winner of the Doncaster Cup in autumn. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in England and Brazil.
Background.
Singapore was a bay horse with a white star bred in England by Sir Alec Black at the Compton Stud in Suffolk. As a yearling he was put up for auction and bought by William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely for 12,500 guineas with Cecil Boyd-Rochfort being the underbidder. The price was the highest paid for any male yearling in Britain in 1928. Lord Glanely explained "I bought him not only because of his good looks, but because I thought he would one day make a good stallion." The colt was sent into training with Lord Glanely's private trainer Thomas Hogg at Newmarket, Suffolk.
He was sired by Gainsborough who won the wartime Triple Crown in 1918 and went on to sire numerous good winners including Hyperion, Solario and Orwell. Singapore's dam Tetrabazzia won three races and was a granddaughter of the Epsom Oaks winner Mrs Butterwick.
Racing career.
1930: three-year-old season.
Singapore "met with an accident" in 1929 and did not race as a two-year-old. He made his track debut in April 1930 when he was unplaced behind Christopher Robin in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and then finished well down the field in the 2000 Guineas which was won by Diolite. He missed the Derby and reappeared in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and came home fourth behind Christopher Robin who won from Rustom Pasha. On 27 June he recorded his first success at his fourth attempt when he won the £1,000 Sandringham Foal Plate at Sandown Park. A month later he was narrowly beaten in the Gratwicke Produce Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse when attempting to concede ten pounds to the winner Ramesses the Second.
At Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September Singapore, ridden by Gordon Richards, started the 4/1 joint-favourite alongside Parenthesis in a thirteen-runner field for the 155th running of the St Leger. The other contenders included Diolite, Ut Majeur and Rustom Pasha, who had defeated older horses to win the Eclipse Stakes but the field was considered a substandard one by St Leger standards. Singapore took the lead from Parenthesis a furlong from the finish and won by one and a half lengths with Rustom Pasha three quarters of a length away in third. Richards reported that he had been confident of winning at every stage of the race.
On his final appearance of 1930, the colt was dropped back in distance for the ten furlong Champion Stakes at Newmarket but finished unplaced behind Rustom Pasha. He ended the year with earnings of £11,616, making him the second most financially successful horse of the season.
1931: four-year-old season.
Singapore was kept in training as a four-year-old with the Ascot Gold Cup as his main objective. The 1931 Gold Cup on 18 June proved to be a highly controversial race which saw Singapore (ridden by Richards) beaten a short head by Trimdon after being barged into the rails by the winner inside the final furlong. Trimdon's rider Joe Childs had dropped his whip and was unable to prevent his mount from veering to the right in the closing stages. The racecourse stewards did not hold an inquiry and Lord Glanely declined to lodge an objection as to do so would have been seen a breach of etiquette at the Royal meeting. Singapore was subsequently brought back in distance for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown but finished unplaced behind the 25/1 outsider Caerleon.
On 11 September, Singapore returned to the scene of his St Leger success to contest the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles. Ridden as usual by Richards, he started the 13/8 favourite and won very easily by four lengths from the seven-year-old gelding Brown Jack. He crossed the line still under restraint from Richards and Lord Glanely commented that his trainer had never been so confident of winning a race. Singapore broke down on hard ground in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket in October and was retired from racing.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Singapore an "average" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
At the end of his racing career, Singapore became a breeding stallion in England before being exported to Brazil in 1943. The best of his offspring was the St Leger winner Chulmleigh. His other foals included Indian Call, the dam of Ballymoss.
Pedigree.
Singapore was inbred 4 × 4 to St Simon, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Cronery

Cronery () is a townland in the 
civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Crinnera.
Geography.
Cronery is bounded on the north by Corratillan townland, on the west by Cartronnagilta, Cornacleigh and Derrinivver townlands, on the south by Drumlaydan and Sradrinan townlands and on the east by Culliagh townland. Its chief geographical features are the River Blackwater, County Cavan, forestry plantations, dug wells and spring wells. Cronery is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 188 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Cronery was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of the four polls of "BMcGoagh" (an abbreviation of Ballemagoechan).
The 1659 Down Survey map depicts the townland as "Carmarie" and "Carmary".
William Petty's 1685 map depicts it as "Carmarie".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Crunnary or Carmarie".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 13 March 1610, King James VI and I granted "four polls of Ballemagoechan to Cahell M'Owen O Reyly". The four polls consisted of 1 in Bealaghlyan, 2 in Acoylagh and 1 in Cronarry, totalling 200 acres. The said Cathal O'Reilly was the nephew of two chiefs of the O'Reilly clan- Aodh Connallach mac Maolmhordha who was chief from 1565–1583 and Eamonn mac Maolmhordha who was chief from 1596–1601. He was also a brother of Cathaoir O'Reilly who received lands in Kildoagh townland and first cousin of Donill Backagh McShane O'Reyly who was simultaneously granted lands in Burren (townland).
An Inquisition of King Charles I of England held in Cavan Town on 31 March 1635 stated that "Cahell O Reily was seized in his lifetime of (inter alia) one poll of Cronarry. He died 1 January 1634 and his son Hugh O'Reily had reached his majority and was married".
The O'Reilly lands in Cronery were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland (spelled "Cronory") as belonging to Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford.
A grant dated 7 July 1669 was made from King Charles II of England to John Skeffington, 2nd Viscount Massereene for "33 acres and 3 roods of profitable land and 93 acres 1 rood and 28 perches of unprofitable land in Carmary".
A deed by Thomas Enery dated 29 Jan 1735 includes the lands of "Cronery".
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Cronery". A further deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774 includes the lands of "Cranery".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Cronerry".
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Cronery".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list twenty-one tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance survey Namebooks state- "The townland is bounded on the east side by a large stream."
The Cronery Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 95, being 44 males and 51 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 102, being 52 males and 50 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twentyseven landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 88, being 46 males and 42 females. There were nineteen houses in the townland, of which two were uninhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are thirteen families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are sixteen families listed in the townland.

Telefónica SA v Commission

Telefónica SA v Commission (2014) C-295/12 is a European competition law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Telefonica appealed against a Commission fine of €151m for abuse of dominance for wholesale ADSL broadband in Spain from 2001-2006. Telefonica had a statutory monopoly on retail provision of landlines before 1998. It was the only company with a nationwide fixed telephone network. It provided wholesale broadband to other telecomms companies, and its own retail services. The Commission found Telefonica imposed unfair prices through a margin squeeze on competitors, so the difference between their wholesale prices and its retail prices were not enough to make a profit. It assessed Telefonica’s downstream costs using LRAIC as the standard. 
The General Court held that to establish a margin squeeze there was no need to show excessive or predatory prices: the abuse was in the spread available. The test was whether an equally efficient competitor, based on the dominant undertaking’s own costs could survive. 
Judgment.
The CJEU upheld the General Court's decision in its entirety, so that Telefonica still had to pay a fine for abuse of a dominant position.

Anna Germundsdotter

Anna Germundsdotter or "Girmundsdotter" (Latin; "Anna Germundi", died 23 March 1538) was a Swedish writer and Roman Catholic nun of the Bridgettine order and abbess of the Vadstena Abbey from 1518 until 1529.
Life.
Anna Germundsdotter was from Söderköping and the maternal niece of Ingemund Petrusson, Canon (priest) of the Linköping Cathedral. She became a member of the Brigettine order of the Vadstena Abbey in 1489. She was the author of the "Codex Holm. A 3", a list documenting the rules of the abbey, from 1502.
In 1518, she was elected abbess by a majority of votes from the monks but a minority of votes from the nuns of the double convent, but the bishop granted her the election victory and had her installed as abbess. She hosted king Christian II of Denmark in 1521.
In circa 1526, the famous scandal about "Liten Agda och Olof Tyste" was to have taken place at the abbey, and the following year, when the Swedish Reformation was introduced, king Gustav I of Sweden gave instructions to the abbess through Bishop Hans Brask, with reference to the scandalous elopement of the nun Agda, who had been placed in the abbey against her will, with her lover Olof, that no-one should be allowed to become a nun at the abbey in the future without permission from the monarch. The existing members were also given royal permission to leave the convent if the wished to do so: some of the younger nuns made use of this permit, and the abbess Anna Germundsdotter was forbidden to stop them.
In 1529, two monks and their confessor attended the Örebro Synod, and was noted to have changed their sympathies to the Protestant reformers. The same year, Anna Germundsdotter chose to resign as abbess and retire as an ordinary member of the convent.

Aga Mir Syed Mohammad Baqir Mosavi

Aga Mir Syed Mohammad Baqir Mosavi or Aga Kirmani () was a religious cleric who came from Kirman, Iran to Kashmir in order to spread the message of Islam. Perhaps he was one of the companions of Mir Syed Ali Hamdani. He came here in 1539 A.D. Another tradition is that he came with founder of Shiaism in Kashmir, 
Mir Sham ud-Din Iraqi in 1500 A.D. He stayed at Wahabpora for a long period of time. 
Martyrdom.
He was killed by Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat Kashgari with an axe near Sama-Taing at the age of 24 years in 1549 A.D. When people heard about his martyrdom they tried to fight a battle against Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat but they failed. This battle is known as "Sama-Taing Battle". People beat their heads and chests in memory of the martyr. His funeral was taken to the Wahabpora and was buried there. 
He was a great jurist, teacher and preacher. He was well experienced in art and handicraft.
Present scenario.
The villagers of the adjacent villages come here every Thursday to offer dua for the deceased and pray. The shrine of Aga Mir Syed Mohammad Baqir Mosavi is surrounded with cemented wall and the colour of the shrine is dark green. A separate committee was established in 1990 A.D. to look after the whole building. This "Astan Welfare Committee" collects all funds of the building and is headed by a president. Astan Bandar (marsiya khani) is organised every year in the month of August or September at the shrine.
Closure of shrine.
Due to lockdown and spread of COVID-19 pandemic his shrine was completely closed for visitors and pilgrims. Astan Bandar was also postponed in the previous year. In November 2020, the shrine was reopened for the pilgrims.

Louis Wilkinson

Louis Umfreville Wilkinson (17 December 1881 – 12 September 1966) was a British author, lecturer and biographer who usually wrote under the pseudonym Louis Marlow. In a long career he associated with a number of the prominent literary figures of his day, in particular the Powys brothers John Cowper, Theodore ("T.F.") and Llewelyn. He also formed close friendships with Frank Harris, Somerset Maugham, and the notorious occultist and magician Aleister Crowley.
As a schoolboy at Radley College, Wilkinson instigated a lively correspondence with Oscar Wilde, then living in exile in France. After a short spell at Pembroke College, Oxford, from which he was dismissed for blasphemy, Wilkinson attended St John's College, Cambridge, where he established a formidable literary and personal reputation – he was known as "the Archangel". In 1905, while still at Cambridge, he wrote and published his first novel. After graduating, he embarked on a career as a lecturer in English literature, mainly in the United States, where he spent most of the following fifteen years and became part of a lively American literary scene. Wilkinson began to write seriously in 1915, and during the next forty years produced a substantial quantity of fiction and biography. In the 1920s he began using the Marlow name, which he retained in his published work for the remainder of his creative life. His books were usually well received by the critics, although their overall impact was modest and stirred little scholarly interest.
After the Second World War, Wilkinson caused a minor sensation when, at Crowley's cremation in December 1947, in accordance with the deceased's expressed wishes, he recited the latter's pagan poem "Hymn of Pan" and other sacrilegious texts – although he was not himself a follower. In addition to his novels he wrote several biographical works, and helped to edit the correspondence of the Powys brothers. After his memoir, "Seven Friends", published in 1953, he faded into relative obscurity, producing little further published work before his death in 1966. He married four times, being twice widowed and twice divorced.
Life.
Early life, schooling, and Oscar Wilde.
Wilkinson was born on 17 December 1881, in the Suffolk town of Aldeburgh, the only son of a clergyman, the Rev. Walter George Wilkinson and his wife Charlotte Elizabeth. At the time of his son's birth, Wilkinson senior was running the Aldeburgh Lodge preparatory school, where Louis received his early education. At the age of 14 he won a scholarship to Radley College, one of England's leading public schools.
At Radley, Wilkinson became fascinated by the case of Oscar Wilde, who in May 1895 was convicted of perjury after two trials and imprisoned for two years. On release in May 1897 Wilde went to France, and by March 1898 was living in Paris, in the Hotel d'Alsace. Wilkinson discovered this address and in December 1898 wrote to the exile, ostensibly to ask for permission to mount a dramatised version of "The Picture of Dorian Gray". Wilde responded warmly, and over the following eighteen months the two exchanged a number of affectionate letters. On 28 November 1899 Wilde asks Wilkinson for a photograph; on 4 January he informs Wilkinson that "the only thing really nice in the whole hotel is your own photograph", and signs off "Ever your friend, Oscar". An attempt of a meeting in July 1900, the year of Oscar Wilde's death, came to nothing. Wilde wrote to Wilkinson a short letter on 15 July: "Dear Boy,/Come and see me next week. I can get you a room in my hotel./I am not going to write to you any more: I want to see you. I have waited long enough.", but a few days later he wrote in French he was very sick, to Wilkinson not go in that week and that he would write to him: "Je suis très malade. Ne venez pas cette semaine. Je vous écrirai." Wilde and Wilkinson never met. Lindsay Smith, in "Oscar Wilde and the Cultures of Childhood" , suggests that Wilkinson was a proxy for Wilde's son Cyril, with whom by law Wilde was not permitted contact. After Wilde's death on 30 November 1900, Wilkinson sent a wreath. Wilde's friend Robert Ross added Wilkinson's name to a list he prepared "of those who had shown kindness to [Oscar] during or after his imprisonment". This association with Wilde deeply affected Wilkinson, and led him to become a passionate advocate against England's repressive laws against homosexuality.
Oxford and Cambridge.
On leaving school in 1899, Wilkinson was accepted at Pembroke College, Oxford to study Classics. Unhappy with the college's overt religiosity, he and a group of friends rejected Christianity and declared an allegiance to atheism. Wilkinson's anti-imperialist views and his opposition to the Boer War added to his unpopularity with the authorities, as did his continued championing of Wilde, a large photograph of whom decorated his rooms. He and his friends were suspected of conducting mock Masses and Confessions; After four terms the Master, John Mitchinson, a former bishop of Barbados, dismissed Wilkinson and his friends from the college on the grounds of supposed immorality and blasphemy.
After the journalist and former Liberal MP Henry Labouchère had campaigned in his journal "Truth" against what he called "the Varsity Star Chamber", Wilkinson was admitted in 1902 to St John's College, Cambridge. His stay at Cambridge was happier and more fruitful; after his Oxford experiences he took care to avoid being publicly associated with anything that was scandalous or blasphemous. Among his closest Cambridge friends was the future essayist and novelist Llewelyn Powys, whose elder brother, Theodore, Wilkinson had known in his Aldeburgh schooldays. 
Other notable associates included the future literary editor J. C. Squire and the future colonial governor Ronald Storrs. Among his contemporaries he acquired the nickname "the Archangel", perhaps on account of his physical and mental attributes, but possibly because of his perceived status as a fallen angel. John Cowper Powys, Llewelyn's eldest brother, described Wilkinson at this time as "a resplendent personage", tall, powerfully built and handsome, "full of an irresponsible and heathen zest for adventure". Llewelyn likened him in appearance to Aubrey Beardsley.
In 1904 Wilkinson met Somerset Maugham when the latter's play, "A Man of Honour" was performed in Cambridge. Maugham was not yet well known; Wilkinson found him "unobtrusive, rather wary, unusually good-looking", although the play impressed him. Maugham and Wilkinson would resume their acquaintance some years later, and a strong friendship would develop; in due course Wilkinson would write that: "[b]y comparison to Maugham, [Bernard] Shaw seemed ... a writer of pseudo-plays a freak, [John] Galsworthy a mediocrity and [J.M.] Barrie a mess". During his final year at Cambridge, in 1905, Wilkinson wrote and published his first novel, "The Puppet's Dallying", using the pseudonym "Louis Marlow", a name which he would resurrect as a mature writer in the 1920s.
Literary career.
Mainly in America, 1905–early 1920s.
"The Puppet's Dallying" did not immediately launch Wilkinson's career as a novelist, although its critical reception was modestly favourable. Wilkinson was influenced by John Cowper Powys into trying his hand at university extension lecturing, and accepted an invitation to make a six-month American lecture-tour on English literature in the year 1905–06. This venture proved a success, and was followed by regular further tours. Dissatisfied with the financial terms arranged for him by the American Society for the Extension of University Teaching (ASEUT), in 1910 Wilkinson combined with G. Arnold Shaw, Powys's manager and publisher, to form the University Lecturers Association of New York (ULANY). Thereafter his American activities were organised through this body. In 1914, in recognition of his work, he was awarded an honorary D.Litt degree from St John's College, Annapolis. When not in America, Wilkinson lectured in England and Europe, and developed Oxford University's Extension Lectures syllabus on the 19th century English poets.
In America, Powys introduced Wilkinson to Frances Gregg. She was an established figure on the avant-garde American literary scene, mixing with among others Ezra Pound and "H.D." (Hilda Doolittle), the latter having been for a time her lover. Powys was deeply in love with Gregg, but being married and unwilling to divorce, could not himself pursue matters with her. Instead, in April 1912 Gregg married Wilkinson, causing Powys much long-term jealousy. The unconventional newlyweds invited H.D. to join them on their honeymoon in Venice; she accepted, and prepared to go, but was eventually persuaded otherwise by Pound. The honeymoon was nevertheless eccentric, as the couple were joined in Venice by John Cowper and Llewelyn Powys, where the four behaved, according to one writer, so scandalously that they were arrested, and almost thrown out of the city.
Wilkinson had first met the occultist and writer Aleister Crowley in about 1907, and the two became closer friends after 1915, when they were both living in America. Crowley would later gain notoriety as "The Great Beast" and "The wickedest man in the world". Wilkinson was never a follower of Crowley's teachings – "We hardly ever discussed magic. Nor did we talk much about sex" – but admired him nonetheless: "My chief feeling about him is one of personal gratitude, for I have known very few who, as persons, have impressed me more or rewarded me more than he did". Wilkinson also observed that Crowley's voice and intonation closely resembled that of Winston Churchill. 
By 1915, Wilkinson had begun writing again, contributing short stories to publications such as "Pearson's Magazine" and "The Smart Set". In 1916 he wrote the pamphlet "Blasphemy and Religion", in which a fictitious lord and his son discuss two contrasting recent works by John Cowper Powys and his brother T.F: "Wood and Stone" and "The Soliloquy of a Hermit". The dialogue suggested T.F's artistic superiority over his brother. In the same year Wilkinson published his second novel, "The Buffoon", in which the principal character is "Jack Welsh", a satirised version of John Cowper Powis. Two more novels quickly followed: "A Chaste Man" (1917) and "Brute Gods" (1919). Wilkinson had by this time become acquainted with Frank Harris, the Irish-born journalist, editor and biographer of Wilde, who after a turbulent career in Britain had moved to America at the outset of the First World War and later taken American citizenship. Harris considered "Brute Gods" to be Wilkinson's best work to date: "[It] deserves to be read very carefully even by those who think themselves masters of the story-telling art".
Harris was sufficiently taken with Wilkinson to include him in the third volume of his "Contemporary Portraits" series, published in 1920. His encomiums tend to treat Wilkinson, then nearing forty, as a newcomer to the literary scene: "I expect considerable things from Wilkinson ... [he] has the heart of the matter in him ... and so I bid him gird up his loins and give us his very best." Much later, Wilkinson described Harris as "a man of violent projections, brutal, gross, sentimental, and yet poetic ... his hand against every man's and every man's hand against him; but as a person, a talker, he was surely a man of genius".
Since 1915 Wilkinson had been associated with New York's Greenwich Village literary set, and acted as an unofficial mentor to the future poet, essayist and scholar Kenneth Burke. Wilkinson was a constructive critic of the younger man's early literary efforts, advised him what to read, and introduced him to Theodore Dreiser and other established writers. In time Burke developed an enthusiasm for the "moderns" was not encouraged by Wilkinson: "I'm sick to death of the whole blasted lot of them", the latter wrote, adding that James Joyce was absurdly overrated. Despite this division of view Wilkinson and Burke remained on good terms and continued to exchange occasional letters until 1926.
Popular British novelist, early 1920s–1946.
In 1923 Wilkinson's marriage to Gregg ended in divorce, and he settled in England to resume his career as a novelist. Under the resurrected pseudonym "Louis Marlow", between 1928 and 1930 he published four novels in quick succession. These works received varying degrees of critical approval, generally favouring his style over the quality of his chosen themes. The first of these, "Mr Amberthwaite" (1928) is a magical fantasy of which Crowley wrote: "In all literature I know no pages so terrifying as those in Louis Marlow's Mr. Amberthwaite, which describe his dream". "The Observer"s reviewer thought the story of "Love by Accident" (1929), turning on the protagonist's self-imposed celibacy, was an inadequate vehicle for the book's more serious injunctions against warmongers and literary censorship. For the third of the books, "Two Made Their Beds" (1929), an introduction was supplied by Maugham. After their initial meeting in Cambridge, Wilkinson and Maugham had met again in 1909, in Florence, and their friendship subsequently deepened. Maugham's biographer Ted Morgan writes that the older man's interest in the novel arose because it dealt with "the overwhelming significance of money in the affairs of life" – Maugham was, according to Morgan, obsessed with money. When "The Lion Took Fright" (1930) appeared a year later, "The Observer"s critic praised the author's probing wit in handling "so disagreeable a theme" (the love of an adolescent girl for an unscrupulous older man). "Punch"s critic wrote: "Mr Marlow shows an insight into human affairs that deserves more interesting material".
In 1934, Wilkinson published a different kind of book, the autobiographical novel "Swan's Milk", in which he represents himself as "Dexter Foothood", and depicts many of his real-life acquaintances, including the Powys brothers, Maugham, Oscar Browning and others. According to the critic Philip Dodd, in this book "the distinction between fact and fiction is hard to draw, since 'fact' is recorded as being 'fiction' or a fictional character as belonging to 'fact' ". Wilkinson's closest literary friendship remained that with the Powys brothers, and in the mid-1930s he produced his first conventional biographical work, a study of the brothers entitled "Welsh Ambassadors". A contemporary review found the book "extraordinarily vivid", adding "Some may find Mr Marlow's revelations of the lives disturbing, for reticence is no part of the Powys code". In a favourable review of Belina Humfrey's account of the brothers ("Recollections of the Powys Brothers", 1980), J. Lawrence Mitchell writes: "Only Louis Wilkinson [in "Welsh Ambassadors" and "Swan's Milk"] similarly catches the men behind the writers".
After "Welsh Ambassadors", Wilkinson was a regular visitor to the Swiss sanatorium where Llewelyn Powys, his closest friend among the brothers, was slowly succumbing to tuberculosis – he died in December 1939. Wilkinson wrote nothing of substance in this period; after his friend's death, he edited "The Letters of Llewelyn Powys", which was published in 1943. In 1944 Wilkinson produced his single venture into the science-fiction genre, "The Devil in Crystal", described by "The Observer"s Alan Pryce-Jones as "an odd little fantasy", in which the protagonist, through a warp in time, is able to relive a part of his past life. In 1946, Wilkinson wrote his last full-length novel, "Forth, Beast", a sequel to "Swan's Milk", in which he reprised his Dexter Foothood persona. "Punch"s critic observed that the ingenious form of the book allowed the author to portray himself, as Foothood, rather more favourably than might have been possible in a conventional autobiography.
Later life, 1946–1966.
When Crowley, in failing health and virtually penniless, was in need of a new home in 1945, Wilkinson was instrumental in finding him a place in Nethercott, a large boarding-house in the English south coast resort of Hastings. On Crowley's death in December 1947, Wilkinson became one of the estate's three executors. Crowley had requested that there should be no conventional religious service at his cremation, but that passages of his works be should be read, which Wilkinson agreed to do. There was considerable press interest and anticipation as to the form the ceremony, to be held at Brighton crematorium, would take. On the day, the congregation was equally divided between mourners – Crowley's friends – and reporters. John Symonds, Crowley's biographer, records that "the tall and dignified figure of Louis Wilkinson" read Crowley's poem "Hymn of Pan", extracts from "The Book of the Law", and finally Collects from the Gnostic Mass. The attendant press sensationalised the event with lurid headlines, suggesting that a Black Mass had taken place, and the scandalised local authority announced that steps would be taken to prevent any recurrence of such a ceremony.
In 1948, Wilkinson was sufficiently well regarded to be photographed for the National Portrait Gallery by Walter Stoneman. In the same year he published "Sackville of Drayton", a biography of George Sackville, 1st Viscount Sackville. The book was reviewed critically by the subject's great-great-grandniece, Vita Sackville-West, who, far from defending her distant kinsman, upbraided Wilkinson for his whitewashing of the viscount, long a pariah in her family. She characterised Sackville as "obstinate, arrogant, coarse-grained, lacking all statesmanlike vision, almost every word and act reported of him contradicts the case that Mr Marlow so gallantly endeavours to put up".
As Wilkinson aged, his literary output diminished. In 1953 he produced his final full-length work, "Seven Friends", a compendium of brief lives of some of his more remarkable acquaintances: Wilde, Crowley, Harris, Maugham and the three Powys brothers. In 1954 he served on a committee formed to organise Wilde's centenary celebrations, including the erection of a commemorative plaque at Wilde's Tite Street address. In 1958 he edited and published "Letters of John Cowper Powys to Louis Wilkinson", which the reviewer Douglas Hewitt described as "largely a libretto for a performance [by] a pair of outrageously shocking old men". Thereafter Wilkinson lived in quiet retirement; his last published work was a contribution to a series of essays on the works of T.F. Powys which appeared in 1964; "Bumbore: a Romance", a short parody of John Cowper Powys's 1916 novel "Rodmoor", was not published until 1969, after Wilkinson's death. A second parody, this time of Henry James's 1897 novel "What Maisie Knew" – it was provisionally entitled "What Percy Knew" – was left incomplete; the available fragment was published privately later. Wilkinson enjoyed a brief return to the public arena with several BBC radio broadcasts of reminiscences, between February 1964 and May 1965. He died on 12 September 1966 at the home of his son Oliver, at Westcott Barton, near Oxford.
Appraisal.
The long interval between Wilkinson's student novel and his second venture in the genre led some reviewers to treat the series of novels he published between 1916 and 1919 as the works of a young newcomer of promise, rather than of a mature writer. Thus, while prophesying "a notable future" for the writer, "Punch"s reviewer wrote of "A Chaste Man", the third novel: "Mr Wilkinson has committed the fault common to clever young novelists of putting into what looks like a first novel all sorts of things that happen to be in his imagination or experience, without any particular regard for their pertinence to his theme". During his writing career Wilkinson received mostly favourable critical comments – words such as "clever", "skilful" and "witty" appear regularly in reviews. He was sometimes chided for the apparent dullness of his themes, and on one occasion for his "galvanic mode of expression", but was generally respected in the literary world, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Nevertheless, his standing among the ranks of modern novelists remained relatively modest, and after his death he was largely forgotten. A few of his titles have been reprinted in the late-20th and early 21st centuries, but no significant scholarly appraisal of his work has been published. He is unlisted in modern works of literary reference such as "The Oxford Companion to English Literature", although "The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature" (1972) supplies a list of his principal works. The main collection of Wilkinson's papers and manuscripts is held by the University of Texas at Austin, in the Harry Ransom Center; a number of letters to the educationist Oscar Browning, dating from 1903 to 1910, are held at King's College, Cambridge.
Wilkinson's role as the premier critic of the Powys brothers was recognised when Kenneth Hopkins dedicated his 1967 study "The Powys Brothers" to Wilkinson. "The Times" obituarist thought that Wilkinson had the qualities to be a leading literary critic, had he been prepared for the hard grind of regular reviewing. According to "The Times" he would be remembered, aside from his professional gifts, as "a ripe and rewarding personality with a genius for friendship." Wilkinson himself thought that he might be remembered only as the man who read the "Hymn of Pan" at Crowley's funeral. Wilkinson's friends often praised him in extravagant terms, and in a typical tribute included in "The Letters of John Cowper Powys to Louis Wilkinson, 1935–56", Powys described Wilkinson thus:
"... on top of Integrity &amp; Sang Froid &amp; sexual Rascality worthy of Scarron or Villon or ... even of the Ribald of Arezzo, for from out of Italy come all the origins of all the renaissances of civilisations — there enters with you Dignity, &amp; Diplomatic Urbanity, Suavity, Reserve &amp; Ambassadorial Discretion such as some great Politician (I am not referring to Mr Gladstone) would display on his Augustan path".
Wilkinson's marriage to Frances Gregg produced a son and a daughter. The son Oliver (whose godfathers were John Cowper Powys and Aleister Crowley), was born in 1916, and had a long career as a writer, theatre director and producer, notably in the Iona Theatre, Glasgow, which he founded. He died in 1999. The daughter, Betty, was killed along with Frances and her mother in an air raid on Plymouth in April 1941. After his divorce from Frances, Wilkinson married Ann Reid, a writer and novelist, with whom he had another daughter, the dedicatee of "Seven Friends". Reid published two novels: "We Are the Dead" (1929) and "Love Lies Bleeding" (1930), before her death in 1932. Wilkinson then married Diana Bryn; his fourth wife was Joan Lamburn, a writer of children's stories, who died in 1956. The four wives appear, lightly fictionalised, in "Forth, Beast".

R (Vodafone Ltd) v Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform

R (Vodafone Ltd) v Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (2010) C-58/08 is an EU law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Vodafone Ltd (along with Telefónica O2 Europe plc, T-Mobile International AG and Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd, Hutchison 3G UK Ltd and the GSM Association) claimed that the Roaming Regulation 717/2007 lacked any legal basis under TEC art 95 (now TFEU art 114). This capped charges that mobile operators could make for roaming services on public mobile networks for voice calls between member states. They also argued it was disproportionate and offended the principle of subsidiarity, imposing a ceiling for wholesale charges per minute and for retail charges, plus an obligation to inform roaming customers about the charges.
AG Maduro gave an opinion that there was no lack of proportionality in price regulation.
Judgment.
The CJEU Grand Chamber rejected that the Regulation had no basis. TEC art 95 measures had to be adopted to genuinely improve the establishment and functioning of the internal market: "R (British American Tobacco Investments Ltd) v Secretary of State for Health" (2002) C-491/01. The Regulation ensured a coherent framework based on objective criteria for smooth market functioning, a high level of consumer protection and competition among networks. National measures were adopted that led to divergence in rules. It was legitimate.

Alfredo Maria Garsia

Alfredo Maria Garsia (14 January 1928, Augusta, Sicily - 4 June 2004, Augusta, Sicily) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and bishop.
Life.
He was ordained priest on 1 July 1951. Pope Paul VI appointed him bishop of Caltanissetta on 21 December 1973 and he was consecrated on 2 February the following year by cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo.

Robert Daglish

Robert Daglish (1779-1865) was a colliery manager, mining, mechanical and civil engineer at the start of the railway era.
Daglish was born in North East England. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1830. He died at Orrell on 28 December 1865 and is buried at the Church of St Thomas the Martyr, Upholland. He had married Margaret Twizel in 1804. Their children included George (1805-1870), who became a surgeon and Robert.
Dalglish moved to Lancashire in 1804 where he was employed by Lord Balcarres to manage Haigh Foundry and the adjacent Brock Mill Forge. While at Haigh he built pumping, winding and blast engines which in their day were described as "improved and efficient machines".
Around 1810, Daglish moved to Orrell where he was appointed manager of John Clarke's Orrell Colliery. Having seen the rack locomotives John Blenkinsop designed for the Middleton Railway near Leeds in 1812, under licence, he built the "Yorkshire Horse" to the same design as Blenkinsop's "Salamanca". He converted the colliery wagonway between the collieries at Winstanley and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Crooke to a running track with stone sleepers and iron rails. The locomotive was built at Haigh Foundry. Under Daglish's management the colliery was extremely profitable. He built a second locomotive and said they each did the work of 14 horses saving the company about £500 per year.
Dalglish supervised much of the construction work on the Bolton and Leigh Railway which opened in 1828.
he rebuilt the locomotive, "Novelty", for the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway in 1833. With his son, Robert who erected the machinery for that railway's inclined planes, they operated the line from 1839 until 1848. Dalglish was consulted by other railway companies such as the Newcastle &amp; Carlisle Railway in 1832 and the Great North of England Railway. He won a prize in the London and Birmingham Railway's competition for the best design for rail chairs. In North America, Dalglish was consulted by the Baltimore and Susquehanna, the Boston and Providence, the New York and Harlem and Norwich and Worcester Railroads.
Robert Daglish (1809-1883).
Daglish's son, Robert (1809-1883) was also an engineer. He trained with Hick and Rothwell in Bolton before moving to Lee Watson and Company's St Helens Iron Foundry. The foundry supplied machinery for mills, mines, waterworks, glassworks, and railways. Iron lattice truss bridges were supplied to the Liverpool and Bury Railway in 1846. He was also a railway contractor.

Oak Island Golf Club

The Oak Island Golf Club (OIGC) is located in Caswell Beach NC on the south side of Oak Island looking out at the Atlantic Ocean. Part of the Lower Cape Fear region in Brunswick County, Southeast North Carolina, it is one of the few 18 holes golf courses built on a barrier island. The privately owned 6,720 yard, par 72 course is open to the public and has 37 bunkers with water in play on 11 holes. Laid out with five sets of tees which present a wide range of playability, the back (blue) tees are course rated at 73.1 with a slope of 139. A pro shop/pub/snack bar along with a full practice facility to include a sand trap, both putting and pitching greens, and a driving range is also available to the public. 
History.
The first nine holes were completed in 1962 while the second nine opened to the public in 1975. The course architect, George Cobb (1914-1986), in addition to being the co-designer of Augusta National's par 3 course, is also the architect for over 100 other courses in the southeast US to include East Lake in Atlanta GA, Quail Hollow in Charlotte NC and Sea Pines in Hilton Head SC. The Oak Island layout features ultra-dwarf TifEagle greens and Bermuda tees/fairways/rough with Long Leaf Pine, Live Oak and Yaupon Holly trees bordering most every fairway. In December 2017, the original 1962 clubhouse/restaurant was torn down and a new facility built which opened in December 2019.
Golf Events.
Tournaments are held year round with the most popular ones being a mixed scramble event on Super Bowl Sunday, the Superintendent’s Revenge in late winter where the course is set up with no concern for the rules of golf and pin positions are unbelievably difficult, the Southport-Oak Island Classic captain's choice event sponsored by the local Chamber of Commerce in the spring which includes a "Putt for Green" competition, the annual Battle of the Beaches where all the neighboring communities compete against each other in a team event, the Club Championship in late August which also includes a senior and super-senior competition, and the weekend Member-Guest tournament in October.
Golf Associations.
The Linksters men's group dates back to 1986 and holds monthly tournaments on Saturdays where individuals and two or four man teams compete in best ball, scramble or total score events. There is also a match play elimination tournament held during the spring/summer and a mixed couples putting contest on a Sunday afternoon in September followed by a banquet. The December monthly competition includes a post event luncheon where awards are presented, the highlight of which is the Joe O’Brien Cup (former Town Mayor) presentation to the golfer of the year.
Its counterpart, the Oak Island Women’s Golf Association (OIWGA) is an equally active group that conducts year-round weekday (Wednesday) and weekend (Saturday) morning competitions. Tournaments held during the year include the mixed couple Sadie Hawkins Day contest in March, the Member-Member team event in April and the two day Women’s Championship Stroke Play competition in September. A combined Linkster/OIGWA team event is held in October while the final event of the year in December is followed by an awards luncheon.
Course Environs.
Carved out of a maritime forest, the course is built through four residential communities: single family homes in Oak Island Estates bordering holes 10-16; another single family development, the Arboretum 
located between holes 1–2 and 16–18; the Ocean Greens mixed townhouse, condo and duplex community surrounding holes 3-7; and Caswell Dunes, a mixed condo and patio home development alongside holes 5-9.

Calderonista invasion of Costa Rica

The Calderonista Invasion of Costa Rica was a small rebellion carried out in North-West Costa Rica by forces loyal to the disgruntled former president Rafael Calderón, and was supported by the Government of Nicaragua who were unhappy with the election of Jose "Pepe" Figueres Ferrer to the Costa Rican Presidency two years prior.
Beginning.
The rebellion started when forces loyal to former president Rafael Calderón, who were backed by the Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza García, crossed the border from Nicaragua into Costa Rica. Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez provided financial support to the rebels and, reportedly, air support. The rebel forces seized the border town of Villa Quesada on 12 January.
Jose Figueres accused the CIA of covertly aiding Nicaragua's invasion by sending pilots and sorties to covertly attack Costa Rica, notably subjecting at least 11 villages to machine gun fire.
Resolution.
The Costa Rican government appealed to the Organization of American States to investigate. The Organization of American States found the Nicaraguan government was supporting the rebels and as soon as this was announced, the Nicaraguan government ended its support of the rebels. The United States sold Costa Rica four fighter planes, while the rebels were overwhelmed by the popularly backed government forces. After some fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were pushed out of Costa Rica.

Joe White (footballer, born 1999)

Joseph Frederick White (born 16 January 1999) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for Southern League Premier Division South club Hendon.
White started his career in the Dagenham &amp; Redbridge youth academy, making his first-team debut in November 2016. He was loaned out to Wealdstone in February 2017 for the rest of the 2016–17 season. He also spent one month on loan at Hendon in January 2018. At the end of the same month, White signed for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee. He rejoined Wealdstone on loan at the start of the 2018–19 season, before spending the remainder of the season on loan at Biggleswade Town, where he finished the season as the club's top goalscorer. White rejoined Biggleswade Town on loan for the 2019–20 season. He returned to Hendon, this time on a permanent basis, in January 2020.
Early life.
White was born in Camden, London and attended Holloway School in nearby Islington.
Career.
Dagenham &amp; Redbridge.
White began his career in the youth academy at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, where he was described as a "prolific goalscorer". He progressed through the youth system at Dagenham before being involved in several first-team match-day squads whilst also a second-year academy scholar. White made his first-team debut in a 2–1 defeat to Halifax Town in the FA Cup on 15 November 2016, appearing as a 90th-minute substitute. He signed his first professional contract in December 2016, with the deal running until the summer of 2018.
After making three first-team appearances for Dagenham during the first half of the season, White was loaned out to National League South club Wealdstone on 9 February 2017, in order to gain match experience, for the remainder of the 2016–17 season. He made his Wealdstone debut two days after joining, playing the whole match in a 1–1 home draw with Oxford City. White scored his first goal for Wealdstone on 28 February 2017, opening the scoring from close range in a comfortable 3–0 away win at St Albans City. The goal served as the catalyst for a run of five goals in seven matches for White; included in this were three successive 2–1 away victories in which White scored the decisive goal in each match. He made 21 appearances in all competitions during the loan agreement, scoring seven times, before returning to Dagenham upon the expiration of the loan deal.
Having made two first-team appearances for Dagenham at the start of the 2017–18 season,&lt;ref name="Games played by Joe White in 2017/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; White signed a new three-year contract extension with the east London club on 31 August 2017. Dagenham manager John Still stated the contract extension was down to White's "rapid improvement" and that it was a reward for his hard work. In Dagenham's next match, White scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 home victory over Gateshead on 2 September 2017. He did not play for Dagenham thereafter due to injury, and subsequently joined Isthmian League Premier Division club Hendon on a one-month loan deal on 9 January 2018 in a bid to regain match fitness. White made his competitive debut for Hendon in a 3–0 defeat to National League opposition in the form of Sutton United in the FA Trophy on 14 January 2018. In the club's next match, a Middlesex Senior Cup quarter-final, he scored five goals in a 9–1 home victory against Spelthorne Sports. He scored six times in six appearances during the loan agreement as he was recalled by Dagenham a week early ahead of a proposed move ahead of the January transfer deadline.
Stevenage.
White joined League Two club Stevenage on 31 January 2018, signing for an undisclosed fee and on a -year contract. Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace stated the club had previously tried to sign White several times and also urged White to "learn his trade" from fellow striker Alex Revell. He made his Stevenage debut on 17 February 2018, coming on as a 90th-minute substitute in the club's 4–1 victory against Yeovil Town at Broadhall Way.
Ahead of the 2018–19 season, on 24 July 2018, White returned to Wealdstone on a 28-day loan contract. Having scored once in his opening five appearances at Wealdstone, the loan was extended for a further 28 days on 22 August 2018. White returned to Stevenage upon the conclusion of the loan and subsequently joined Biggleswade Town of the Southern League Premier Division Central on 19 September 2018, on a three-month loan deal. The loan agreement was extended for the remainder of the 2018–19 season in December 2018. White scored 23 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions during his time at Biggleswade, finishing as the club's top goalscorer for the season. He rejoined Biggleswade on loan on 15 July 2019, scoring 13 times in 23 appearances during the first half of the 2019–20 season.
Hendon.
White rejoined Southern League Premier Division South club Hendon for an undisclosed fee on 8 January 2020. The transfer meant he would be playing under manager Lee Allinson, who had managed White during his two loan spells at Biggleswade Town. White scored nine times in nine matches before Hendon's season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. After scoring five times in 12 appearances during the opening months of the 2020–21 season, the Southern Football League season was curtailed once again due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. White signed a new one-year contract with Hendon on 6 May 2021.

House of Gravina

The House of Gravina was a noble family of Norman origins, with roots stretching back to Rollo, the first ruler of Normandy.
History.
The house was founded by Silvano, owner of the land of Gravina in modern-day Apulia, from which he and his descendants took the name. King Martin I of Sicily, on 20 November 1405, formally recognised the family's noble Norman origins by issuing a diploma (a form of charter) upon Giacomo of Gravina. Following the charter, Giacomo chose to relocate the family to Sicily, where the King allowed him and his descendants to be buried in the Royal Chapel of Catania, now known as Basilica della Collegiata.
Heraldry.
The house's coat of arms is emblazoned as ""Azure, two bends Or, a mullet of ten points in sinister chief Argent"." Its motto was "Spero", which translates to "I hope" from Italian.

FS Class E.332

FS Class E.332 was a class of three-phase electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS). They were used for the haulage of passenger trains between 1917 and 1963. Designed and built at the same time as the FS Class E.331, they represented an attempt by FS to extend the use of three-phase AC electric traction from primary to secondary routes. Their performance was disappointing and they were relegated to a marginal role, in which they remained despite several modifications.
Overview.
The good results of the experiments with, and then regular use of, the three-phase AC traction system, had, by 1912, induced the FS to order 45 locomotives of Class E.550 and 16 of Class E.330. The Material and Traction Service of FS now decided to consider the possibility of breaking the monopoly of the Italian Westinghouse Company (Società Italiana Westinghouse) with the acquisition of two new classes of locomotives for passenger trains, the E.331 and the E.332.
In the spring of 1913, FS prepared the design of the mechanical part to be used for both classes and, after long private negotiations, entrusted an order for the construction of 18 locomotives to the company Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno. The order was divided into two. The first, dated 14 December 1913, was for 6 machines to be built according to the design of the mechanical part prepared by the FS and with the electrical part designed and built by Ateliers de Construction Oerlikon of Oerlikon, Zurich, which gave rise to the Class E.332.
The second, dated early in 1914, was for 12 machines with an E (0-10-0) wheel arrangement, intended for the haulage of freight trains, which would have constituted a new Class 051 (E.551 according to the classification of 1914). The latter, however, were not built because of the termination of the contract, which took place in the spring of 1914 for unknown reasons.
Together with the Class E331, the Class E.332 formed the last chapter in the collaboration between the FS and Swiss industry in the field of three-phase electric traction.
Numbering.
The numbering in group 034 (0341-0346) originally planned was not adopted. All the machines entered service with the number E.332.1-6, adopted in the spring of 1914. The definitive numbering E.332.001-006, adopted in 1917, was practically applied in 1931.
As in all groups of three-phase alternating current system locomotives the second digit of the group number (034 and then E.332) indicated the machines with larger diameter wheels ("high wheels") intended for passenger trains.
In the definitive classification that came into force in 1917, the letter E. indicated an electric locomotive, the first digit 3 indicated the number of driving axles, the second 3 indicated machines with "high wheels" and the third digit indicated the chronological number of the project.
The identification plates affixed to the sides led, as a rule, to the marking FS 332.001 (and following) without the letter E. This was probably because the numbering was carried out in 1931 at the Grandi Riparazioni workshop in Rimini which, specializing in steam locomotives, did not have a mould for the letter "E".
Technical details.
Mechanical part.
The running gear allowed good riding on curves at high speed, especially on the tortuous lines of the Ligurian Riviera, in particular on the Genoa - Sampierdarena - Savona line, which was electrified on 1 September 1916.
Inspired by the E.3101 locomotive of the French Chemin de Fer du Midi, a 2'C2' wheel arrangement was used, with sloped connecting rods and jackshafts. This choice was dictated by the need to connect the large motors (2.14 metre diameter), located in the central part of the body, to the wheels without using the patented V-shaped connecting rod of the E.330.
The design of the body, containing the two control cabs, motors, and electrical and pneumatic equipment, was similar to that of the Class E.331.
Electrical part.
The traction circuit was designed and patented by the Oerlikon engineers. It provided two cascade connections (6 and 8 poles) and two parallel connections (also 6 and 8 poles). The starting rheostat was of cast iron, divided into 16 steps and controlled by an electro-pneumatic switch. It, together with the motors, needed energetic cooling, and this was provided by two electric fans with a total power of 12 kW. Overheating was a constant problem and often caused breakdowns.
Construction.
According to the contract, the class should have been delivered by September 1915, but the entry of Italy into the First World War pushed all industries to favour the construction of military equipment with consequent delays to orders for civilian materials, such as locomotives. This led to a delay of about two years in deliveries, which were made as follows:
The works plates show the year of construction as 1915, so it appears that construction was already well advanced at the beginning of the hostilities.
Performance.
According to the project specification, the E.332 should have delivered four speeds that, at the voltage of 3700 V and the frequency of 16.7 Hz, should have been 37, 50, 75 and 100 km / h. At these speeds, tractive effort should have been 88, 88, 93 and 59 kN.
These values were not achieved, owing to some incorrect assumptions in the design of the electrical equipment, especially regarding the combination with the cascaded motors. The defects were most obvious at low speeds.
Following modifications in 1917-1918, working on the Giovi branch line, they could independently haul a 230-tonne train (i.e. five 1921 type carriages) at a speed of 75 km / h. On the Genoa - La Spezia line, from 1925 onwards, they could haul loads up to 410 tonnes at the first three running speeds, with performance equivalent to that of the E.333.
After the war, on the Genoa - La Spezia line, the following loads were permitted:
Statistics published by FS in 1938 showed that the overall reliability of the class had improved to match the average for three-phase locomotive classes.
Service.
From 1917 to 1925 Class E.332 served on the Genoa - Savona line and on the Giovi branch. From 1925 they were assigned to hauling passenger trains along the Riviera di Levante (Genoa - La Spezia line). Following the contraction of traffic generated by the economic crisis of 1929, the whole class was stored at the Rimini repair shops and remained there until 1934. From 1934 all were assigned to Turin, where they hauled trains on all the flat lines, or those with modest gradients, radiating from the Turin. Occasionally they worked trains destined for Genoa and Savona.
Depots.
The locomotives were allocated to the following depots:
Nicknames.
The E.332s, like the E.331s, were dubbed "Assassins" and "Coffins" due to fatal accidents caused by the placement of electrical equipment (particularly the main switch, cooled with oil) behind the cabs without adequate protection in the event of an explosion.
Preservation.
No units have been preserved

Sikota Wina

Sikota Wina (born 31 August 1931) is a Zambian former politician. He was a member of the Legislative Council and the National Assembly and the country's first Minister of Health. He also held the posts of Minister for Local Government and Minister of Information, Broadcasting and Tourism.
Biography.
Wina was born in Mongu in 1931. His father was Chief Minister to the Paramount Chief of Barotseland. He attended Kafue Training School and then Munali Secondary School in Lusaka, before going on to study at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa. However, he was expelled from the university due to his political activity.
Wina returned to Northern Rhodesia and worked in the Information Department of the colonial government, and in 1954 he was arrested for entering a whites-only restaurant. In 1956 he began working as a journalist, editing the "African Life" magazine. He was arrested again in March 1959 as part of a drive against "suspected subversives". After being released from detention in Bemba, he joined the United National Independence Party (UNIP) and became it publicity director.
In 1962 Wina was elected to the Legislative Council for Copperbelt West in the general elections that year. He subsequently became Parliamentary Secretary to Kenneth Kaunda when Kaunda was appointed Minister of Local Government. In the 1964 general elections he was elected in the Luanshya–Kalulushi constituency and was appointed Minister of Health in Kenneth Kaunda's government. He became Minister for Local Government later in the year. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in the 1968 general elections representing the Roan constituency after Luanshya–Kalulushi was abolished, and was appointed Minister of Information, Broadcasting and Tourism in December 1968.
Wina left politics in the 1970s. In 1984 he was arrested at Bombay Airport in India for alleged drug smuggling. According to Indian government prosecutors, he jumped bail and used a fake Sudanese passport to fly back to Lusaka under the name Hussein. Upon his return to Zambia, he claimed the drugs had been planted. Together with his wife, Wina was jailed in April 1985, but was released the following year without facing a trial.
After multi-party politics was introduced at the start of the 1990s, Wina became a member of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy and was elected to the National Assembly in the Chililabombwe constituency in the 1991 general elections. Following the elections, he was appointed Deputy Speaker, but resigned from the post in 1994 after another drug-dealing scandal. He was re-elected in 1996, but defected to the United Party for National Development prior to the 2001 general elections and ran in the Mulobezi constituency. Although he was beaten by the MMD's Michael Mabenga, the result was overturned by the Supreme Court in September 2003 due to Mabenga using state resources during the election campaign. Wina contested the subsequent by-election, but was defeated by Mwiya Wanyambe of the MMD.
Wina is the brother of politician Arthur Wina. He was originally married to Glenda Puteho McCoo, an African-American, before marrying Nakatindi Wina, a politician and member of the Barotseland royal family, in the 1970s. Nakatindi died in 2012.

TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc v Ofcom

TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc v Office of Communications [2013] EWCA Civ 1318 is an EU law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
TalkTalk claimed that charge controls should be imposed upon BT. In 2010, Ofcom reviewed competition in the wholesale broadband market. BT was the main provider. Before Ofcom published its Market Review Determination, TalkTalk said it would install its own broadband equipment in 700 local exchanges belonging to BT, as yet unspecified. As they were unknown, Ofcom ignored them in defining ‘Market 1’ and said even if TalkTalk deployed its plans, BT would still have a market share of at least 70-80%. This led Ofcom to say BT had significant market power in ‘Market 1’ and imposed a charge control, published in July 2011. By then, TalkTalk had completed unbundling, setting up in 17 exchanges in Market 1. Under CA 2003 s 86, Ofcom concluded there was no material change in Market 1, and BT’s market share would stay above 70%. 
Judgment.
The Court of Appeal held by a majority that Ofcom’s determination was correct and charge controls under CA 2003 section 86 could remain. McFarlane LJ and Sir Timothy Lloyd held that, though the circumstances had changed, it could not be seen as a material change under CA 2003 s 86. If forecasts of change had not been falsified to a material extent, there was no material change. The actual changes were within the scope of Ofcom’s predictions. Sir Bernard Rix dissented, arguing Ofcom substituted a new ‘Market 1’ definition, relating solely to ‘exchanges where only BT is present’, and should make a fresh Market Review Determination. 
Sir Timothy Lloyd said the following.

Vodafone Ltd v British Telecommunications Plc

Vodafone Ltd v British Telecommunications Plc is an EU law case relevant for UK enterprise law, concerning telecommunications.
Facts.
Vodafone argued that Ofcom should not subject it to price controls. Ofcom had found that Vodafone had significant market power in their networks for mobile call termination (a caller on one network is connected to a mobile recipient on another network). It capped Vodafone’s charges for wholesale service of mobile call termination for four years, reducing average charges gradually. BT appealed to the CAT, arguing the price controls were set too high. The CAT referred to the Competition Commission. The Tribunal found before that under the Communications Act 2003 section 195 it could direct Ofcom to reset price controls for a four year period. It was argued that the CAT had no such power when a period had already elapsed.
Judgment.
Lloyd LJ, Moore-Bick LJ and Richards LJ held the Competition Appeal Tribunal had no power to direct Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective basis. Under CA 2003 section 195(5) it was clear there was no power to direct Ofcom to do something it would otherwise have no power to do. Under section 45(10)(e) Ofcom had the power to revoke or modify conditions that were in force, but that did not include a power to modify a condition with retrospective effect.

Westpark Mustard

Westpark Mustard was a white and black racing greyhound in the 1970s. By Newdown Heather out of April Merry she broke the British and European record of 19 consecutive victories held by Mick the Miller, when recording a 20th consecutive win on 28 October 1974.
Racing career.
Westpark Mustard was entered for the 1973 English Greyhound Derby but the race distance was too short for her. She began to come to prominence over staying distances (longer distance races) and on 7 January 1974 won the Abbey Cup at Wembley Stadium beating Myrtown by a head, which was the first win of the 20 race British and European record.
The run was extended to five wins after she won the Longcross Cup at White City Stadium in February. Trained by Tom Johnston Jr., the bitch won another ten races including winning the GRA Stakes and setting a track record at Brough Park over 725 yards. She had captured the public's imagination and with the winning sequence standing at 15 she broke into season on 12 May.
After seasonal rest her connections entered her for one off open races, deciding to avoid the Gold Collar and Cesarewitch. Five open race wins secured the new British and European record feat of 20 successive victories with the 20th win aptly named the Mick The Miller Record Stakes.
The winning sequence failed to extend past 20 wins following a series of unfortunate incidents that led to her being beaten at Shelbourne Park. Her owner Cyril Young (who ran his greyhounds under the alias Cyril Scotland) was receiving criticism from the Scottish press for using an alias name which upset him and therefore he decided to run the greyhound in Ireland. His trainer Tom Johnston had reservations about changing the greyhounds routine which proved true when Westpark Mustard failed to win her next race. To make matters worse she was seriously ill after the race. After several more races she was retired to stud with breeder Dave Murphy.

Jasmine Solano

Jasmine Solano is an American musician and disc jockey who founded and hosted the "Scratch the Surface" series on MTV, and in 2008 she teamed with DJ MeLo-X to perform internationally as Electric Punanny.
Solano created a radio show called "The Secret Spot" on WERS in Boston, and she has written and performed alternative hip-hop songs, including "That's Not It", with a video directed by Vashtie Kola in 2010, "Turn It Up" in 2011, and "One on One" featuring Yelawolf in 2012. She has deejayed for Ninjasonik, Wiz Khalifa, Talib Kweli and Melanie Fiona.
Solano is a political activist, using music and art to express political ideas. In 2017, she created the global photography/community series "Unity in Color" to promote women's rights around the world. As a brand ambassador, she has modeled clothing, curated playlists, and blogged to promote brands.
Early life.
Solano was born and raised in Philadelphia, the daughter of parents from two different cultures: her mother is from northeast U.S. and her father is from Indonesia. She learned to appreciate Motown songs and classic R&amp;B from her mother's taste in music. At the age of 9, Solano began to play tennis seriously. The same year she danced at a talent show to the song "Shoop" by Salt-N-Pepa. At 15 she was choreographing breakdancing moves for shows, and performing poetry and spoken word at open mic events. She was part of the Okayplayer movement, making music with friends, beginning with rap lyrics. With music engaging more of her life, she decided at age 15 or 16 to focus on a music career rather than on professional tennis. With the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan, Solano started combining music and political activism, organizing a multimedia protest against war. She learned turntablism from a friend who worked at Siren Records in the Doylestown area north of Philadelphia, and by watching videos of deejay competitions.
College.
Solano chose to form her own music activism major at Emerson College in Boston, combining music production, marketing and politics. In December 2002 at age 17 she began deejaying at Boston's WERS 88.9 FM radio station, then in 2005–2006 she served as the station's program director, creating a late night show called "The Secret Spot" in which she took calls, gave advice on love, and played soul/R&amp;B slow jams. The show is the origin of her stage name Jasmine Solano, and it earned her the "Best Female Radio Personality" at the New England Urban Music Awards in 2006. During her college years, Solano participated in the Semester at Sea program, taking the opportunity to connect with the underground music scene of ten different countries.
Career.
In 2009, Solano opened Rock the Bells with her DJ set. After that exposure, MySpace marketing connected with Solano, giving her the opportunity to open for Rakim and The Clipse. Red Bull Music Academy also noticed Solano, inviting her to deejay and host shows starting in late 2009 in New York City. In 2010, Solano toured with Wiz Khalifa as his DJ for 60 concerts across the U.S.
Solano hosted another radio show starting in 2014 on Radio Lily, with tropical- and reggae-themed music broadcast from Miss Lily's store in New York City for two hours each Tuesday afternoon. She also produced a monthly event at the W Hotel in New York City in 2014–2015, creating a "Velvet Dreams" mix for the hotel. Other VJ and DJ clients include MTV, HBO, Apple, Margiela, Fendi, Nike, Adidas, "Cosmopolitan", and "Nylon" magazine.
MTV World created a global music initiative in October 2011, called MTV Iggy. Solano hosted a series on MTV Iggy which started airing in 2014: "Scratch the Surface". The program was conceived by Solano as a way to show the viewer something interesting about the music world in every city she visited. MTV Iggy was dissolved in 2015.
Solano played a set in Palm Springs during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2017, as part of an all-female deejay pop-up party sponsored by Beats by Dre.
Electric Punanny.
In 2007, Solano and MeLo-X met at the Sway nightclub in New York City. They collaborated in 2008 to create a monthly deejay party under the name Electric Punanny. The music was a fusion of electro-funk, dancehall and reggae. Early shows were at the 205 Club, but the show gained a larger following at the Sway Lounge. The duo began to tour internationally and to release music together. In 2013, they performed in France, Japan and Australia, including a set for the Island Vibe Festival on Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah). Personal electronics maker House of Marley sponsored a tour of North America in early 2014, including a performance at the "Do Over Party" in Palm Springs after the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. In June 2014, Electric Punanny played the Glastonbury Festival, at the Blues Stage in the Silver Hayes area. They played at the Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn in August 2014. The group's techno-dancehall mashup "Rosa Caleta" was their first release together in October 2014, the song named after a Jamaican restaurant in Berlin. After performing in China, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, the duo played SXSW in March 2015. In 2017, Electric Punanny released the song "Tiger Eye" featuring Donae'o. This was followed by "Gymnastics On Fire", a summer jam featuring the Afro-R&amp;B collective The Wav, released on the EPINTL label by Beatport.
Brand ambassador.
Solano has worked as a brand ambassador, promoting clients' brands in various ways. In 2011, she modeled for the Summer Lookbook of Leah McSweeney's "Married to the Mob" fashion line, and she posed and performed for Jay-Z's Rocawear Fall 2011 line, rapping her own words over beats by Jay-Z. For Nike, she posed for the January 2012 Holiday Lookbook, then modeled for 10 Deep's Summer line. The same year, she blogged on the platform BurtonGirls.com for Burton Snowboards. Burton tapped Solano again in 2013 to model Gwen Stefani's Lamb brand winter clothing. Solano served as brand ambassador for Adidas Women during 2015–2016. She also modeled Timberland boots in 2016. In 2017, L'Oréal featured her in a global campaign.
In 2016, Solano curated a playlist for ONS Clothing of New York City.
Deejay hardware and software company Serato lists Solano as an exemplary artist representing the Serato brand.
Activism.
In January 2017, Solano founded the Unity in Color movement, a photography series showing communities around the world, brought together to promote women's rights. In the first year, the movement had gathered 1,300 men, women and children in 4 countries taking part in 30 photo shoots.
Musical style and influences.
As a deejay, Solano has played many types of music. At WERS in Boston, she started spinning hip-hop, R&amp;B and reggae, then she created the show "The Secret Spot" which featured sexy slow jams. Through Electric Punanny, her musical tastes run to African and Caribbean beats combined with classic soul/R&amp;B and high-energy dance music. Solano says she may prepare a playlist for a specific party, but then the mood of the party brings to mind other songs to blend in, so that most of her work is freestyle deejaying.
To personally recharge, Solano listens to jazz and neo-soul music.
Solano lists Betty Davis, Nikka Costa, Erykah Badu, and Gwen Stefani as strong women in music who have influenced her work. She has named DJ Qbert and Mix Master Mike as inspirations for her own career in turntablism.

Rethinking Economics

Rethinking Economics is a network of students and academic scholars in several countries that promotes pluralism in economics. It is part of the broader International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics and has groups in the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, India, Bangladesh, the US and many more countries. The goal of the movement is to open up the discipline to different schools of thought in economics other than neoclassical economics and to other disciplines in the social sciences. Another aim is to make economics more accessible to the broader public.
Background.
In 2011, the Bank of England organized a conference ‘Are Economics Graduates Fit for Purpose?’ which although widely discussed did not lead to substantive changes in the way economics is taught in many universities. Subsequently, a group of Manchester economics students who were dissatisfied with the inertia of the economics discipline after the Great Recession founded the Post-Crash Economics Society.
Goals.
The group campaigns for multiple changes in the research and teaching of economics as well as for a different connection between economics and the public. Specifically, Rethinking Economics demands more real-world applicability of the contents in economics degrees. Moreover, they want to show that economic approaches are contested instead of being akin to physics-like laws, which makes it necessary to introduce students to a variety of approaches in orthodox and heterodox economics as well as equipping them with tools to critically evaluate these approaches. The campaign's goal is therefore not to displace Neoclassical economics but instead to let other approaches join the ranks in economics curricula and research. Another aim of the group is to make economic knowledge more widely available and breaking economists' monopoly of such knowledge.
Activities.
The networks in the various countries are actively campaigning for changes in the curriculum of economics degrees. This includes lobbying with economics departments at universities, organizing public events and providing material to students and teachers in economics. The British Rethinking Economics group has to date published two books on the subject. In The Econocracy, a team of students link the dominance of neoclassical economics to an erosion of a wider democratic discussion about how the economy should be seen and organized. A second book called provides an overview of different schools of thought in economics that are rarely included in introductory textbooks of economics. It includes chapters on several heterodox schools of thought written by leading academics in the field.
The Dutch branch of the organization has conducted an extensive curriculum review of undergraduate economics degrees in the Netherlands. Courses were evaluated according to different criteria such as how many different methods and schools of thought are taught, how much critical thinking is fostered and the real-world relevance of the courses.
Both the Bank of England and the Institute for New Economic Thinking have collaborated with the movement in the past.
Rethinking Economics for Africa (REFA), which emerged out of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and has since expanded across South Africa, hosts an annual Rethinking Economics for Africa Festival, sponsoring students from across the continent to attend and featuring discussions and debates by prominent economists including Thandika Mkandawire, Jayati Ghosh, James Galbraith, and others. The festival is free for students, academics, and members of the public. https://www.facebook.com/REFAFestival
Reception.
The movement has received coverage by newspapers such as the Financial Times and endorsements by various public figures. Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang praised their newest book as a 'highly relevant and enlightening contribution to a debate that will shape the future of the world economy as well as the way in which economics is taught and debated'. Chief economics commentator of the Financial Times Martin Wolf wrote the foreword to the book and welcomed the initiative.

Kopacz and pilot Justin Kripps tied with the German team of Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis for the gold medal.
Career.
Kopacz started his sporting career as a varsity level shot putter at University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. With encouragement from his university coaches he attended a Canadian talent ID camp for bobsleigh athletes in April 2013. Kopacz would start racing later that year with Nick Poloniato on the North American race circuit. The next year he competed with Chris Spring in the 2014–15 Bobsleigh World Cup, his first year in the top level circuit. At the 2015 World Championships Kopacz battled through pneumonia to help push Spring to eighth place in the four-man bobsled. He stepped on the podium for the first time at the World Cup event in Lake Placid, New York, as part of Justin Kripps' four-man team.
During the 2016–17 Bobsleigh World Cup Kopacz missed the first half of the season due to an adductor tear. He would return to the World Championships, again pushing Kripps to a sixth-place finish in the four-man. The next season he and Kripps found their groove, they would earn four podium finishes together in the 2016–17 Bobsleigh World Cup and finish first overall in the World Cup to win the Crystal Globe as overall World Cup champions.
They would carry this momentum into the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. In the two-man competition he pushed Kripps to second place through the first two of four runs. In the second day of competition, they were in the lead after three runs. In the fourth and final run they were just a few one hundredths behind Francesco Friedrich of Germany, but in the final run they made up enough time to win gold. In fact the run put them in a tie with Friedrich for the top of the podium. Kripps and Kopacz began celebrating with team, family, and friends. Kopacz said of the gold medal that "within a couple minutes it was a sea of emotion, a sea of teammates and tears from my parents."
Personal.
He completed his mechanical engineering degree at University of Western Ontario in 2013 and keeps his skills up through contract work. He contracted COVID-19 in April 2021 and was later hospitalized in London, Ontario.

Farebrother-Sullivan Trophy

The Farebrother-Sullivan Trophy is a Fijian rugby union competition open to the regional representative teams of the districts of Fiji.
History.
The trophy was offered to the Fiji Rugby Union by JJ Sullivan and AS Farebrother, the latter being the manager of the first Fijian team to play abroad in 1924.
Between 1941 and 1953, this competition was disputed in the form of cup between the regional district teams. Five of them would participate to the first edition in 1941. Since 1954, the competition develops around a match: the holder of the trophy accept the challenges from the other teams and the trophy is attributed to the winning team.
This format is also used in New Zealand, in the Ranfurly Shield. The challenges generally are played at the end of summer and in autumn. In case of draw, the defending champion keeps the trophy. Practically, only the three teams from the first division of the regional competition, the Colonial Cup, compete, but for three times, a team from the inferior division, the B-Division, challenged the defending champion.
Suva, won the trophy between 1941 and 1947, undefeated in 1951. Nadroga dominated the competition in the 1970s, establishing the record of 28 consecutive wins, before Nadi came to join the competition in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, Lautoka and then, Naitasiri, founded in 1998, became the fourth and fifth great names of the competition.

Cichlidogyrus philander

Cichlidogyrus philander is a species of Monopisthocotylean Monogenean, in the family Ancyrocephalidae. It is ectoparasitic on the gills of the fish "Pseudocrenilabrus philander".
The species has been described by Laurence Douëllou in 1993 from fish collected in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. A complete and detailed redescription of the species, using scanning electron microscopy in addition to traditional microscopy, has been done by Igeh, Dos Santos &amp; Avenant-Oldewage in 2017. These authors used specimens collected from the same fish species, from Padda Dam, Gauteng, South Africa.
Genetic characters derived from the 28S rDNA, the COI mitochondrial DNA and ITS1 rDNA regions distinguish "C. philander" from all other "Cichlidogyrus" sequenced species.
Morphology.
"Cichlidogyrus philander" is characterised by a penis with a sharp, curved, lateral termination, an accessory piece with a hook-like extremity that may appear forked terminally, and lack of a visible vagina. The transverse bars of the haptor have concave and convex surfaces with ribs on the concave surface. The dorsal bar of the haptor bears fenestrations at the base of the auricles and the ventral and dorsal gripi are dissimilar. The large first pair of uncinuli shows lateral wings on the left side of the base. On top of this wing, a ball-like structure with a small fenestration is visible.

History of Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC

Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC is an American professional soccer team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1998 and beginning play in 1999.
Club history.
Founding.
The Riverhounds were founded by Paul Heasley, chief executive of Pittsburgh-based Alliance International Ltd., a merchant banking and investment firm, in 1998 as a member of the USL A-League. Pittsburgh was awarded the then-unnamed club on March 11, 1998 with the announcement coming from then USISL commissioner Francisco Marcos. The franchise was awarded to the Heasley and his ownership group known as Alliance Soccer Resources, Inc. and became the first professional team in Pittsburgh in 30 years. Heasley, based in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, wanted to create role models and a pathway to a professional career for local talent. The club's name was initially announced as the Pittsburgh Riverdogs after a naming committee of five local businessmen with an interest in soccer was established to name the club in 1998. The "Riverdogs" name was suggested by Mike Geigel, a member of the committee. Other names that were considered were the Pittsburgh Pulse and Pittsburgh Power. In December 1998, before the "Riverdogs" ever played a match under that moniker, the name was changed to the Riverhounds after the Charleston RiverDogs, a minor league baseball team in South Carolina, threatened legal action against the club.
The club initially played their home games in Bethel Park, at Bethel Park High School's football stadium. John Kowalski was named the first head coach of the club and Justin Evans, a local Peters Township native, was the first player drafted to play for the Riverhounds. Dave Kasper, another Pittsburgh native, was named the first vice president and general manager by Heasley in 1998, a position that he held for the club's first two seasons before taking up executive positions with the New England Revolution and D.C. United. Heasley and Kasper initially worked out of a small office in Pittsburgh's South Side. In their inaugural season, the Riverhounds advanced to the conference semi-finals in the A-league playoffs after finishing the regular season with a 16–12 record. Following the season, the Riverhounds were named the A-League Organization of the Year. Two years later in 2001, the club achieved its greatest cup success by reaching the U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals after beating the Colorado Rapids of the Major League Soccer and then-A-league opponent El Paso Patriots in their first two games, but the Hounds were eliminated in the quarterfinals by their second MLS opponent of the tournament, the Chicago Fire, in a two-overtime, 3–2 defeat. In 2004, the club moved down to the USL's Second Division. The team also moved to Moon Township to play at Moon Area High School's football stadium for just one season. The 2004 season saw the club also earn its most notable league accomplishment, winning the USL Atlantic Division with a record of 17-2-1. In December 2004, Heasley sold the team to Sports Facility LLC, owners of the Washington Wild Things baseball team of the Frontier League. The Riverhounds played both the 2005 and 2006 seasons at the Wild Things' minor league baseball stadium, Consol Energy Park, on the outskirts of Washington, Pennsylvania, about south of Pittsburgh. The franchise continued to hold soccer academies and training for youths across the tri-state Area, but went on hiatus and did not play during the 2007 season due to a structural reorganization. During that hiatus, the Riverhounds were sold yet again to a new ownership group. This time, the club was purchased by Greentree Sports-Plex. At the time, Jason Kutney, then Riverhounds defender and future Riverhounds CEO and co-owner, was also CEO of the multi-sport facility.&lt;ref name="PG North/South/East/West"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2007, the organization announced another venue change. Beginning with the 2008 season, Chartiers Valley High School's stadium, located just off the Kirwin Heights exit of Interstate 79 in Pittsburgh's South Hills, would be the new home of the Riverhounds. The club played its home matches in the stadium through the 2012 season when its own, permanent soccer-specific stadium was completed. Another significant development just prior to the 2008 season was a partnership that was entered into by the Riverhounds and Everton of the Premier League. As part of the partnership the Riverhounds would implement Everton's youth development program into its own academies. Because of this partnership, the Riverhounds also changed its color scheme from its original red, black, and white palette to predominantly blue with white and black accents, reflecting the colors of Everton.
From its inception in 1998 to 2012, the club was sold at least three times and called four stadiums home until achieving more stability and beginning the process of acquiring its own stadium beginning in 2012.
2012.
Months before the opening of the 2012 USL Pro season, despite speculation and previous attempts to build a permanent home for the Riverhounds at other locations, on December 8, 2011 it was revealed that a stadium for the club could be built at Station Square on what was, at the time, the site of the amphitheater close to downtown Pittsburgh as part of a redevelopment of the area. However, at the time there was no timeline set for the proposed redevelopment. Less than a month later on January 10, 2012, an official announcement was made that the construction would begin and that the stadium would be completed by summer 2012, meaning that the club could play at least a portion of its 2012 home schedule at the new stadium. Construction of the stadium was scheduled to begin in late March to early April 2012 and to be completed during summer 2012. However, construction at the site began in August, several months behind schedule, and the stadium's projected opening was scheduled for fall 2012, potentially as soon as late September. The stadium was financed with an estimated $7 million by private investors in addition to several corporate sponsors including Highmark who hold naming rights for the stadium. Thus, the stadium was named Highmark Stadium. Because of the prolonged construction of Highmark Stadium, the Riverhounds played the entirety of their 2012 season at the stadium of Chartiers Valley High School, the stadium in which the club had played since the 2008 season. In April 2012, the Riverhounds signed Matt Kassel, formerly of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. Following the standout season in which he scored a team-leading six goals, he was named to the USL PRO All-League 2nd Team, the only Pittsburgh player to make the 1st or 2nd team selection. Following his impressive season, Kassel returned to Major League Soccer by signing for the Philadelphia Union for the 2013 season. In 2012, the Riverhounds also experienced a short run in the 2012 U.S. Open Cup as they entered and were eliminated in the 2nd round after losing 0–1 to the Michigan Bucks of the lower division Premier Development League. The club finished the regular season second to last in the league with a record of 4-5-15, only finishing above the Antigua Barracuda and missing out on the playoffs. The club played its final match at Chartiers Valley High School on August 10, 2012.
2013.
Prior to the 2013 USL Pro season, Pittsburgh signed several experienced offensive players such as Rob Vincent, Kevin Kerr, and José Angulo. Although several warm-up matches and other non-soccer events were held at Highmark Stadium previously, the first official Riverhounds league match took place on April 13, 2013 against the Harrisburg City Islanders, several months after the anticipated completion date. The Riverhounds went on to lose the opening day match 1–2 in front of a sellout crowd of over 4,000 fans. Newly signed Riverhounds striker José Angulo opened the scoring in the match, thus scoring the first goal in the new stadium's history. In summer 2013, the Riverhounds introduced the Frank B. Fuhrer International Friendly Series, an annual international friendly match pitting the Riverhounds against top clubs from around the world. The series was named after investor and local businessman Frank B. Fuhrer who was also former owner of the Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer team. The first edition of the series was held on July 19, 2013 as the Riverhounds fell 1–4 against reigning FA Cup holders Wigan Athletic with José Angulo again scoring the Riverhounds' only goal of the match. On the final matchday of the 2013 regular season, Angulo scored Pittsburgh's only goal in a 1–1 draw with the regular season champion Richmond Kickers. With the goal, Angulo tied Dom Dwyer's goal tally of 15 for the season but was crowned scoring champion on total points, with a total of 34 to 31, after he tallied four assists and Dwyer tallied only one. Angulo's 15 goals tied Dwyer for the all-time single season USL Pro scoring record, which was then broken by Kevin Molino of Orlando City SC the following season. At the end of the season, Angulo was also named USL Pro league MVP. Another single-season league record was set by a Pittsburgh player in 2013 as Matthew Dallman tallied twelve assists for the Riverhounds throughout the season. This was the first time in league history that Riverhounds players led the league in both categories. On June 27, 2013 it was announced that Terry "Tuffy" Shallenberger of Connellsville, Pennsylvania became an investor in the club, a move that would have major significance to the club in the near future. Shallenberger also established a Riverhounds academy in his hometown at that time. After a slow start to the season in which the Riverhounds recorded only two victories in its first ten matches, the club finished the regular season seventh in the league with a 10-8-8 record, qualifying for the playoffs. However, the Riverhounds did not make it out of the first round after suffering a heavy 0–5 defeat to Orlando City on August 24, 2013.
2014.
In October following the 2013 season, it was announced that former minority shareholder Tuffy Shallenberger had become the majority owner of both the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium with 51% ownership, with some of his new shares being purchased from Jason Kutney. The following month, the Riverhounds announced that it was forming the Pittsburgh Riverhounds U23 team which would begin play in the Premier Development League during the 2014 season as part of the club's player development system. Despite, and potentially because of, the Riverhounds organization's rapid growth, the team filed for voluntary Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Reorganization on March 26, 2014, before the start of the 2014 USL Pro season. Riverhounds majority owner Tuffy Shallenberger stated that the voluntary filing was necessary to reorganize and alleviate financial stresses on the club that stemmed from additional spending which was incurred to increase construction speed at Highmark Stadium which was not part of the original $10.6 million budget. Filing for bankruptcy was seen as a necessary measure to keep the organization growing and make the city an attractive potential home for a Major League Soccer team. Additionally, Riverhounds CEO Jason Kutney stated that the restructuring of debt would, "put the company in a position where that (joining MLS) can be considered, we have to right the ship and make sure we have a model that can work long-term" and that, "We want to break free of these shackles that have held this company hostage the last few months and restructure debt to the point that we can fully engage these (growth) models." Shallenberger stated at that time that he would provide interim financing to keep the team and stadium running during bankruptcy and that the schedule and day-to-day operations of the club would be not affected. Despite the bankruptcy, the Riverhounds participated in the 2014 USL Pro season as planned. During the season, the Riverhounds were the official USL Pro affiliate of the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer as part of a partnership between the USL Pro and MLS. As part of the affiliation, Houston loaned Brian Ownby, Michael Lisch, Anthony Arena, Bryan Salazar, and Jason Johnson back and forth with the Riverhounds throughout the season. The club also made several high-profile player signings to strengthen the squad throughout the season, including Dutch international Collins John, Ghanaian international Anthony Obodai, and former MLS player and Zimbabwean international Joseph Ngwenya. In May 2014, the club parted ways with head coach Justin Evans, the club's manager for the previous five seasons. Despite high expectations going into the season, the club was winless in its first seven matches and in last place in the league. Riverhounds player and academy coach Nikola Katic was named interim head coach at that time. The club made a playoff push late in the season but were defeated 1–2 by Arizona United on the final matchday, needing a victory to qualify. Ultimately, the club finished the season 11th in the league with 32 points. Although they did not qualify for the playoffs, the Riverhounds experienced a strong U.S. Open Cup run, advancing to the fourth round before losing to the Chicago Fire 1–2 after adverse weather conditions halted the match three minutes into the second half.
2015.
On November 7, 2014, it was announced that the Riverhounds had emerged from voluntary bankruptcy. The club's plan moving forward called for seeking additional sponsorship opportunities so that the club and Highmark Stadium would be profitable within three years. It was also announced at that time that Jason Kutney would be kept on as the club's CEO and that Nikola Katic would be retained as an assistant coach after having finished the 2014 season as the club's interim head coach. The club began its search for a new head coach and an experienced club president. On December 17, 2014 the Riverhounds met both objectives by hiring championship-winning, longtime Charlotte Eagles head coach Mark Steffens as head coach and Englishman Richard Nightingale, a former executive at Nike, Inc., as president of both the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium. Allegheny Health Network was then unveiled as the club's new jersey sponsor, replacing #1 Cochran Automotive. Some of Steffen's first changes included signing several former Charlotte Eagles players such as Drew Russell and Fejiro Okiomah, in addition to naming Josh Rife, another of Steffens' former players, as a second assistant coach and head coach of Pittsburgh Riverhounds U23. International players such as South African Lebogang Moloto, Brazilian Vini Dantas, Haitian Max Touloute, Jamaican Ryan Thompson, and Canadian Tyler Pasher were signed to the heavily revamped roster while Colombian José Angulo, 2013 league MVP, former record-holding goalscorer, and the Riverhounds' top scorer the previous two seasons, left the club and signed with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League. Another of Nightingale's first orders of business was dissolving the affiliation with the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer which was entered into the previous season, stating that the club preferred to remain without an MLS affiliate to have more autonomy and freedom with their own roster. However, former Dynamo loanee Anthony Arena returned to the club by signing outright with Pittsburgh after being released by the Dynamo at the end of the 2014 MLS season. The Riverhounds finished the 2015 preseason undefeated, getting results of four wins and one draw in five matches. The club continued its impressive performances into the regular season, earning a 5–2 opening day victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders on March 28, 2015. In the match Rob Vincent and Kevin Kerr lead the Pittsburgh offense with a brace and a hat-trick, respectively. The match marked the first time that the team had ever scored five goals in a single match at Highmark Stadium. Over the next five matches, the club went 1-2-2 and were winless on the road despite being the highest scoring team in the Eastern Conference and Rob Vincent leading the league in both goals and points at that point of the season. The club's performances were inconsistent to that point, alternating between low-scoring draws or losses and offensive outbursts. The midfield pairing of Rob Vincent and Kevin Kerr, who had tallied four goals and three assists himself, was described by one analyst as, "the most entertaining pair of UK midfielders this side of the pond." The Riverhounds began their 2015 U.S. Open Cup campaign on May 20 with a 3–0 victory over the West Virginia Chaos with Vincent opening the scoring against his former team, Moloto scoring his first competitive goal for the club, and Kerr getting the final tally. The victory set up a third round encounter with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League at Highmark Stadium. The match would mark the first time that the Hounds had ever hosted a higher division club or a non-USL professional club for a competitive match at Highmark Stadium. With Vincent scoring the game-winner again, this time in stoppage time, the Riverhounds defeated the Rowdies 1–0, setting up an encounter with D.C. United of Major League Soccer at Highmark Stadium in the fourth round, the first match of any kind between the Riverhounds and a MLS side at Highmark Stadium. Three days later on May 30, 2015, the Riverhounds played what one columnist called the "club's greatest ever game" as the team scored three goals in stoppage time for a 6–5 victory over the Harrisburg City Islanders. Vincent and Danny Earls tallied braces for the club while Kerr scored the game-winner. Amara Soumah also scored his first league goal in the match while Ryan Hulings earned his first league appearance and victory. In the match, Lebo Moloto also became the first player to tally three assists in a single match in league history. The match's eleven total goals set a league regular season record for combined goals in a match. The Riverhounds 2015 U.S. Open Cup run came to an end on June 17 as D.C. United defeated the Hounds 3–1. The match was tied 1–1 after regulation time, with Vincent converting a penalty for Pittsburgh goal. D.C. United scored two goals in the two added 15-minute periods to earn the victory in front of a near-record crowd at Highmark Stadium. Entering the final two games of the regular season, Pittsburgh needed to earn four points to qualify for the playoffs. The Riverhounds drew 1–1 with the regular season champion Rochester Rhinos on September 16, setting up a decisive match away at rivals Harrisburg on the final matchday of the season. The Riverhounds went on to earn a 2–1 victory in the match, clinching a playoff spot and fifth place in the eastern conference, in addition to securing the inaugural Keystone Derby Cup between the two Pennsylvania clubs. The team's season came to an end with a 2–4 extra time defeat to the New York Red Bulls II in the first round of the playoffs. The club finished the regular season with 55 goals scored, the most scored by any team in the league.
2016.
Only days after being eliminated from the 2015 playoffs, club president Richard Nightingale announced that Kevin Kerr and Rob Vincent would be returning for the 2016 season, while the club continued to identify new talent to add to the roster. However, in early October 2015, it was revealed that Vincent was on trial with D.C. United of Major League Soccer. On February 17, 2016 it was officially announced that Vincent had impressed D.C. United during their preseason and that he had been purchased by the club for an undisclosed amount. On November 2, 2015 it was announced that Richard Nightingale was no longer with the team and that Shallenberger had taken over as acting president. One source indicated the reason for the dismissal was a rift between the former general manager and the ownership, staff, and players created by Nightingale trying to impose his own decisions that Shallenberger preferred to leave to Steffens. However, multiple sources stated that Nightingale left the team on his own accord to pursue another opportunity and to return to his family in Oregon who did not travel with him to Pittsburgh. The same day, the Riverhounds officially moved into their new training facility, the Allegheny Health Network Sports Complex. The new facility allowed for year-round training and for all levels of the organization, from academy to first team, to practice at the same location. In November 2015 it was announced that Jamaican international goalkeeper Ryan Thompson and the Riverhounds agreed to mutually part ways in the offseason so that he could pursue a contract in Europe or Major League Soccer following his performances as Jamaica's starter at the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup. After one season without an MLS affiliate, it was announced that the club had formed an affiliate partnership with the reigning Eastern Conference playoff champion and MLS Cup runner-up Columbus Crew SC for the 2016 season. The partnership would make the Riverhounds the primary destination for loaned players throughout the USL season. The two clubs had worked together previously as Matt Lampson was loaned to the Riverhounds from the Crew during the previous season. The Riverhounds received Marshall Hollingsworth and Ben Swanson in March 2016 as the first players loaned through the affiliation. Prior to the opening game of the 2016 season, the Riverhounds unveiled a signature beer available at Highmark Stadium, Golden Hound Ale brewed by Pittsburgh-based Penn Brewery. Although three Major League Soccer clubs previously created signature beers, the Riverhounds became the first USL club to do so. Following the sixth match of the season on May 7, 2016 the contract of Romeo Parkes, the team's top goal scorer, was terminated after he kicked New York Red Bulls II defender Karl Ouimette from behind in an incident that sent the player to the hospital. The following week, the Riverhounds were part of a 0–1 defeat to FC Cincinnati which set the USL league attendance record for a single match with over 23,000 fans in attendance at Cincinnati's Nippert Stadium. After not recording a win in the club's first seven games of the season and being eliminated from the 2016 U.S. Open Cup after losing its first match to amateur side Landsdowne Bhoys FC 0–2, head coach Mark Steffens was relieved of his duties on May 21, 2016. The following morning Dave Brandt, head coach of the Navy Midshipmen, was named the club's new manager. The Hounds finished the season with a 6-17-7 record and missed the playoffs for the ninth time in the club's seventeen-season existence. Club owner Tuffy Shallenberger said during a September 2016 interview that he would be focusing on improving marketing for the club, including a possible total rebranding. The club's top scorer for the season was Corey Hertzog who scored 13 goals in 30 matches and finishing the league golden boot race in sixth place. He also led the club in games played, minutes, assists, points, shots and shots on goal. He was named to the USL League Second Team following the season.
2017.
Notable offseason signings included former United States international Gale Agbossoumonde, Saint Kitts and Nevis international Devaughn Elliott, and Barbados international Keasel Broome. The Riverhounds opened the 2017 season at home against defending champions New York Red Bulls II on March 25, 2017. The match ended in a 3–3 draw, with two of the team's goals coming from Corey Hertzog and another from captain Kevin Kerr. The team was eliminated from the 2017 U.S. Open Cup with a 1 to 3 defeat to amateur side Chicago FC United in the second round. The team failed to make the playoffs. Corey Hertzog was the team's top scorer as he moved into third place on its all-time top scorers list. Following the 2017 season, it was announced that the affiliation between Columbus Crew SC and the Riverhounds that had been in place since 2015 had comes to an end. Reasons for the discontinuation included the potential move of the Crew franchise to Austin, Texas and the roster inconsistency that the affiliation caused.
2018.
Saint Louis FC announced the signing of Riverhounds SC's top scorer Corey Hertzog on December 11, 2017, ending the striker's two-year stint with the club. In January 2018 the United States Soccer Federation formally maintained the sanctioning of the United Soccer League as the second tier of the United States soccer league system. To meet division II coaching requirements, Bob Lilley was named the team's new head coach, replacing Dave Brandt who did not hold an "A" license and was therefore not eligible to coach in the league. Lilley brought other members of his former coaching staff at the Rochester Rhinos with him, including assistant coach Mark Pulisic. On February 16, 2018, the team held a special event to unveil new branding for the team. While the Riverhounds name was kept, "Soccer Club" was added to the official team name. The club also unveiled a new circular crest which replaced the hound head which had been a part of the team's logo since its original design. The new crest was designed in the traditional colors of Pittsburgh sports, black and gold, and incorporated iconic symbols of the city including its bridges and rivers. Also announced during the event was the expansion of Highmark Stadium to 5,000 seats which was also required by Division II requirements.
Player development history.
Academy.
In 2007, the Riverhounds formed the Riverhounds Academy around the time that the team was purchased by the Greentree SportsPlex ownership group. Jason Kutney was named the academy's Director of Youth Development. The academy was originally created as a partnership with Premier League club Everton. The partnership with the English club would allow the Riverhounds to share the same training methods and some of the same coaches. Former Riverhounds coach and general manager Gene Klein said, "The agreement is one of the first of its kind in the United States and will raise the level of soccer played in Western Pennsylvania from youth leagues to the Riverhounds." By 2009, the academy had expanded into a year-round program. As of 2013, the academy had between 800 and 1,000 players in its year-round program at any given time, while 1,500 more took part in more than 20 different camps held in the region throughout the year. The Riverhounds Development Academy (RDA) trains players between the ages of 3 and 17. The academy has experienced rapid expansion, increasing the number of participants from 244 in 2007 to over 700 in 2012. As of 2013, the academy generated 80% of the Riverhounds organization's revenue with revenue from the academy increasing from $124,000 to $900,000 over the same period. At that time, the academy maintained a waiting list to join of over 250 youth players. In 2013, the Riverhounds officially unveiled its first registered team to represent the professional club in youth competitions around the United States. Only ten months after the team's inception, it was crowned national champions in U.S. Club Soccer's top youth bracket, defeating top teams from around the country and drawing interest from top NCAA Division I coaches and the United States National Team. Since then, the Academy has sent four of its members to U.S. National Team camps and over 30 players have been invited to the United States Soccer Federation's training center in Ohio. In April 2015, it was announced that the Riverhounds Academy would shift its center of operations from the Greentree SportsPlex to the Allegheny Health Network Sports Complex at Cool Springs in Pittsburgh's South Hills. The 172,000-square-foot indoor multi-sport complex will offer outpatient orthopedic care, diagnostics and athletic training services through Allegheny Health Network and a full-size indoor field which will allow the academy to train year round. The academy officially moved to the new facility on November 2, 2015.
PDL club.
On November 26, 2013 it was announced that the Pittsburgh Riverhounds had secured a Premier Development League franchise that would begin play during the 2014 season as part of the club's player development system as a link between the academy and senior squad. Riverhounds CEO Jason Kutney stated that the purpose of the team would be to provide standout local college players a place to play in the summer, something that they had not previously had. Kutney also believed that providing the opportunity to stay fit and play soccer in the region year-round would attract more players to the area in addition to providing players with the opportunity to be observed by USL and Major League Soccer scouts. In March 2015, Pittsburgh native Anthony Virgara became the first player to sign for the senior squad from the U23 side. Virgara also previously played for a local Riverhounds affiliated academy. The PDL club was dissolved following the 2016 season citing limited resources.
Broadcasting history.
In 2000, the Riverhounds reached an agreement with WPTT to broadcast matches on the radio. Chris Shovlin was the play-by-play announcer on WPTT from 2000 to 2003. Shovlin was partnered with former Riverhounds midfielder Steve Bell during this time. Beginning in 2004, matches were broadcast on WBGG-AM with Shovlin resuming his role as play-by-play announcer. Shovlin won the 2003 Pittsburgh March of Dimes A.I.R. Award for best play-by-play. Following Pittsburgh's hiatus in 2007, matches were broadcast on WPIT with Shovlin again returning as the commentator.
The Riverhounds also reached radio broadcast deals with Fox Sports Radio – Pittsburgh, including in 2005. Chris Shovlin returned to form a play-by-play partnership with former Riverhounds assistant coach Paul Child on Fox Sports Radio. In 2005, FSN Pittsburgh broadcast two Riverhounds matches, the first television broadcasts in franchise history. In 2015 the Riverhounds were again broadcast on cable, this time on WPNT for a match against the Charleston Battery on September 5.
In April 2016, the USL announced that the league had entered into an agreement with ESPN to broadcast the USL Championship match on its cable network while digitally streaming regular season matches on ESPN3. The Riverhounds appeared in the first two matches streamed on this service, including the first broadcast which featured a home match against Orlando City B.
All live USL matches are streamed on-demand in high definition free at youtube.com/USLPRO beginning with the 2014 season. Current broadcasters are Matt Gajtka (play-by-play), Gene Klein (analysis/sideline), and Paul Child (analysis).

Hans-Hermann Dickhuth

Hans-Hermann Dickhuth (born 1 September 1947) is a retired university-based German sports doctor.
His name hit the headlines in 2011 when allegations surfaced that his 1983 habilitation (post-doctoral academic qualification) had been awarded for a dissertation that reportedly contained extensive word-for-word quotations from the doctoral dissertation of one or more of his own students. The potential news value of otherwise mainstream plagiarism accusations was enhanced by the fact that one of the students subsequently became Dickhuth's wife.
Life.
Hans-Hermann Dickhuth was born in Braunschweig. Following qualification, in 1978 he became an assistant to at the Sports Medicine Department at the University of Freiburg. He completed his specialist training in Cardiology at the university. He subsequently headed up the Echocardiography Laboratory at Freiburg where he also worked as a senior clinical physician. In 1989 he transferred to the nearby University of Tübingen where he took charge of the Sports Medicine department. He developed it into a highly successful centre, both clinically and scientifically. After his died in 2000 he returned to Freiburg, taking over in 2001 as Chief Doctor of Sports Medicine at the University Clinic.
That same year Dickhuth succeeded as president of the , a position he retained till 2006. He also held leadership roles during this period in the and the European Federation of Sports Medicine Associations (EFSMA), serving as vice-president of the latter between 2002 and 2012.
From 1981 Dickhuth was supervising top German athletes. After receiving a report on "Doping allegations in respect of doctors in the Sports Medicine Department" ("Dopingvorwürfen gegenüber Ärzten der Abteilung Sportmedizin") the University Clinic eventually withdrew from providing this form of care for athletes. In the same report Dickhuth himself was cleared of any complicity or culpability in respect of doping allegations. It was, indeed, stated that following Dickhuth's appointment to the top job a number of organisational measures had been taken "to bring greater transparency to the individual working groups, patient reporting systems and drugs procurement processes, along with access to examination rooms and the outpatient clinics".
Plagiarism accusation.
On 25 February 2011 the university authorities received information from Letizia Paoli, chair of the "Sports Medicine Evaluation Commission", that while conducting investigations into the "Freiburg doping scandal", they had come across doubts concerning the academic integrity ("Wissenschaftlichkeit") of several pieces of work. As the result of information passed anonymously to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung the press became aware that questions had arisen concerning the dissertation with which Dickhuth had earned his habilitation (qualification) back in 1983. The allegation was that the dissertation employed text from the doctoral dissertation of one of Dickhuth's own students. The Badische Zeitung (newspaper) reported passages (repeated without attribution) identical to some that had appeared in another doctoral dissertation that same year. This time the dissertation identified was one successfully submitted by the student who had subsequently become Dickhuth's wife. The clinic management invited those involved to state their cases before 11 March 2011: Dickmuth took some time off work, starting on 4 March 2011, but returned to his desk on 16 April 2011. The university attempted to instigate a disciplinary process, but this was revoked by the Ministry for Science because of procedural errors. It was also far from clear whether the university management enjoyed the legal competence to revoke a habilitation that had been conferred by the habilitation committee of the university clinic. Reports appeared in the media indicating that the university rectorate had at this point already spent more than half a million Euros on consulting external lawyers.
The former doctoral student Marzenna Orlowska, who subsequently took a job as a pathologist at the Freiburg University clinic, was questioned by reporters. She confirmed that Dickhuth had supervised her doctorate. He had repeatedly recommended changes to her dissertation. Meanwhile, his own habilitation dissertation had been submitted. She had indeed recognised certain passages at Dickhuth's inaugural lecture, but had attached no importance to this.
Independently the Habilitation Committee of the Medical Faculty convened a meeting for 28 June 2012 to discuss the matter, but the meeting was adjourned.
Hans-Hermann Dickhuth has lived in retirement since 1 October 2012. An application submitted by him in 2011 to extend his contract was rejected by the faculty because they were working on a reconfiguration of the entire sports medicine department. Dickhuth therefore withdrew the application and received, in return, the opportunity to continue with his academic work at the faculty for a further year on an "emeritus" basis. On 14 October 2013 the Habilitation Committee of the Medical Faculty decided, by a narrow majority, to withdraw recognition of Dickhuth's habilitation on the basis of the alleged plagiarism. It was the first decision of this nature in the history of Freiburg University. Lawyers for Dickhuth gave notice that they would be mounting a legal challenge against the decision.
On 28 May 2014 a radio report indicated that other habilitation dissertations successfully submitted at Freiburg University also included extensive textual congruences with doctoral works by others. Some of these habilitation dissertations came from professors who had themselves backed the university's withdrawal of recognition from Dickhuth's habilitation. Furthermore, textual analysis suggested that some of the textual extracts in question appeared to have been composed by Dickhuth himself. Also, these dissertations had been submitted only after the submission of Dickhuth's own dissertation. The various timelines meant that it was impossible that Dickhuth had himself copied the questionable passages in his dissertation text.
One of the professors identified in this context was , the medical director at the University Clinic. He had urged that recognition for Dickhuth's habilitation be rescinded in order to avoid giving out the impression that academic misconduct was not viewed with sufficient seriousness at Freiburg. Reports subsequently emerged alleging that Siewert's own habilitation dissertation, submitted many years earlier, was suspiciously similar to the doctoral dissertation of his former colleague, Hans-Fred Weiser.
In September 2014 the withdrawal of recognition from Dickhuth's dissertation became final. The Habilitation Committee had not accepted the legal challenge which Dickhuth had himself withdrawn on 12 September 2014. There was talk of "a deal". Disciplinary proceedings against Dickhuth were suspended on 9 September 2014. He retains the status and privileges of a retired public servant and remains entitled to use the title "Professor", having properly fulfilled his duties as a professor. In February 2016 the grounds for withdrawal of recognition for Dickhuth's dissertation were made public: Dickhuth had indeed composed the contentious section of text himself, but by making them available to six of his doctoral students he had assigned authorship rights to them, in the process excluding his own rights.
Not everyone has been convinced that culpability properly rests with Dickhuth. According to , an authority on the relevant legal background, the case can be persuasively made that it was, in fact, the doctoral students who were the plagiarists. A lengthy analysis of the affair appeared in the journal , and concluded that Dickhuth should not have been deprived of his academic qualification. According to this analysis, Dickhuth could be seen as a pawn, sacrificed to prop up the declining reputation of the University Clinic as a way to avoid budget cuts. In pursuit of that objective, however, the university had expended a seven-digit sum. In other known cases involving habilitation dissertations by top academics in the Medical Faculty, the university management had stayed silent, neither passing the scripts to the relevant investigatory commission, nor even informing the physicians implicated. The report also included the charge against the relevant sub-committee of the habilitation committee that its work had been "slapdash and error-ridden" ("schlampig und fehlerhaft"). According to the "Laborjournal" piece the subcommittee chairman Norbert Südkamp's own habilitation dissertation had included "agreements" in its figures and tables with those appearing in three other dissertations. The report concluded that instead of purporting to revoke Dikhuth's habilitation, the university should have revoked the doctorates awarded to his former doctoral pupils, the misses Orlowska and Wehinger.

Born at Trafalgar Park in Wiltshire, he was the younger son of Horatio Nelson, 3rd Earl Nelson (1823-1913) and his wife, Lady Mary Jane Diana ("née" Agar, 1823–1904). He was known as The Hon. Edward Nelson for almost all of his life, up until he became Earl Nelson in September 1947. He married Geraldine Haddon Cave (1868–1936) in 1889 and with her had eight children: 
Edward Nelson was a Lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion the Wiltshire Regiment with whom he served on the Nile Expedition of 1885–86.
During the Second World War, the North and South Wings of Trafalgar Park were occupied by tenants with Thomas, 4th Earl Nelson, and Edward Agar Nelson living in the main house. He inherited Trafalgar Park in 1947 and sold it in 1948 as a result of the loss of the government pension attached to his title and Death Duties imposed on the estate following the death of his brother.
Lord Nelson died in London in January 1951 aged 90, and on his death the title passed to his son Albert Nelson. Edward had only been Earl Nelson for three years and four months exactly at the time of his death. He is buried in Godlingston Cemetery in Swanage in Dorset.

5'll Getcha Ten

5'll Getcha Ten is the second studio album by American rock band Cowboy. Produced by Johnny Sandlin, the album was released in October 1971 by Capricorn Records. Cowboy formed in 1969 by songwriters Tommy Talton and Scott Boyer. The group was signed to Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records by the suggestion of Duane Allman, guitarist and leader of the Allman Brothers Band. Cowboy's first album, "Reach for the Sky", was released in 1970, and they supported the Allman Brothers on a national tour between 1970–71. "5'll Getcha Ten" was recorded at both Capricorn's studio in Macon and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield, Alabama, as the former was still under construction at the time.
Background.
"5'll Getcha Ten" was released in October 1971. Songwriter and co-founder Talton remembered that while the LP carried the carefree nature of its predecessor, it reflected a maturation in their musicianship, honed while on the road touring. "There was a sense that this is our job now [...] Suddenly we owed money to our record company," he recalled. The group had double the songs necessary for recording a new album, as they were frequently writing. "All My Friends" was inspired by the numerous friends who would stop by the band's rural farmhouse in Macon where they often resided. And Gregg Allman later covered the song on his “Laid Back” album in 1973. "The Wonder"—a staunch anti-war anthem—was written by John McKenze, who was a friend of the band from their beginnings in Florida. Much of Talton's lyricism comes from a spiritual place, though he has said it held no basis in organized religion. In a later reissue for the album's liner notes, he explains that the song "5'll Getcha Ten" was penned after experiencing a turbulent ride through a storm while on the way to a performance in Atlanta. "It's just my little personal observation about how sometimes we don't pay attention to the magnitude of it all," he said.
"Please Be with Me"—perhaps the band’s best-known song—was written by Boyer in just fifteen minutes in a hotel room late in the recording process. Duane Allman plays dobro on the song. An additional take of the song was later added to "Duane Allman: An Anthology" (1972), a compilation spanning his career after his death in a motorcycle crash the year prior. Eric Clapton later covered the song as well on his 1974 album "461 Ocean Boulevard".
Critical reception.
A reviewer for "Billboard" praised the "excellent guitar work" present on the LP, commenting, "the songs have a country feeling, but are soft rock in nature." James Chrispell of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing, "Full of laid-back Southern charm, "5'll Getcha Ten" finds Cowboy further exploring the wonders of back-porch music. Strong songwriting and beautiful harmonies abound here."

Frederick Douglass Woman's Club

The Frederick Douglass Woman's Club was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1906. It was one of the first women's clubs in Chicago to promote suffrage. It was notable because it was one of the few interracial women's clubs in Chicago.
History.
The club was founded in 1906 by Celia Parker Woolley, a white Unitarian minister and novelist. Most of the members of the club were middle-class, and it was an interracial club. The club met weekly, hosting speakers who discussed political events of the day, including votes for women. Speakers included Elia W. Peattie, G. M. Faulkner of Liberia College, and Elmira Springer. Ida B. Wells served as vice president of the club.
The club was housed at the Frederick Douglass Center, a settlement house in Chicago founded by Woolley and Wells, whose purpose was to foster interracial cooperation between African Americans and whites. The club was only one aspect of the settlement house work focused on connecting middle-class black and white women. The influential black activist Fannie Barrier Williams supported the work of the center and the club, believing that interracial activism could both bring women's suffrage and improve the lives of black women and girls in Chicago.
Because of social pressure from the Frederick Douglass Woman's Club, the Chicago Political League, another local woman's club extended their membership to African-American women.

1900 English beer poisoning

In 1900, more than 6,000 people in England were poisoned by arsenic-tainted beer, with more than 70 of the afflicted dying as a result. The food safety crisis was caused by arsenic entering the supply chain through impure sugar which had been made with contaminated sulphuric acid. The illness was prevalent across the Midlands and North West England, with Manchester being the most heavily affected. 
Originally misdiagnosed as alcoholic neuropathy, the main epidemic was only recognised after several months. Additionally, investigation into the outbreak found other sources of arsenic in beer, which had been unknowingly poisoning thousands in decades preceding the outbreak.
Misdiagnosis and investigation.
This mass poisoning is unusual in that it was not noticed for four months. The doctors, seeing patients who were usually heavy drinkers and who showed muscle weakness and numbness of the hands or feet, initially thought that the patients were suffering from "alcoholic neuritis". Nevertheless, a marked increase in the number of cases was noted, with 41 people succumbing to peripheral neuritis, multiple neuritis or alcoholic neuritis and 66 people perishing from alcoholism in the four months of the outbreak, while the previous seven months revealed only 22.
These cases of neuritis were eventually connected to cases of skin discolouration previously thought to be unrelated. Ernest Reynolds, the doctor responsible for making the connection, also noted that only one substance would cause these symptoms: arsenic. He also noted that heavy drinkers who drank mainly spirits seemed less affected than beer drinkers. He gathered samples for analysis from the taverns frequented by his patients, which confirmed the presence of arsenic in the beer they consumed.
Source of the poisoning.
Once the breweries affected were identified, investigation as to where the arsenic came from were instituted. It was found that the arsenic was present in invert sugar provided to the breweries by Bostock &amp; Co. of Garston. To lower costs in the tight-margin English beer market, some breweries substituted high-quality barley malt with low-quality barley malt supplemented with sugar. This practice was somewhat controversial; as part of the Pure Beer movement, an inquiry on the use of brewing substitutes had been called. This inquiry, starting in 1896 and ending in 1899, had concluded that brewing substitutes were not "deleterious materials" under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 and that further legislation was not required. 
This sugar was made by acid hydrolysis of starch, where starch is heated in the presence of an acid to form glucose. Such a method was not new, and had been employed commercially since at least 1814. Bostock &amp; Co. used sulphuric acid to perform the acid hydrolysis. This acid, purchased from Nicholson &amp; Sons, was made from pyrites which contained arsenic, which remained in the final product.
John Nicholson &amp; Sons, of Leeds, had provided sulphuric acid to Bostock &amp; Co. since 1888. For most of the length of the business relationship, the acid provided was free from arsenic. However, in March 1900, Nicholson started supplying unpurified sulphuric acid containing arsenic. This practice continued until November 1900, when the acid was found to be the cause of the outbreak. Nicholson claimed that they did not know the nature of Bostock's use of the acid, and that they could have provided arsenic-free acid if requested.
Alternate sources of arsenic in beer.
Once the main source of the outbreak had been identified as arsenic poisoning, further investigation into arsenic contamination of beer was undertaken. Eventually, it was found that arsenic was also introduced into beer by the malted barley. In the kilning stage of malting, the barley humidity content is reduced by drying the grain with the hot vapours of a fire, usually fuelled by coke or coal. It was found that when arsenic is present in the fuel, it could then be deposited upon the barley before steeping, and therefore would be present in the final product. Investigation into the outbreak uncovered that most cases of alcoholic neuropathy endemic to Manchester were, in fact, misdiagnosed arsenic poisoning, with this alternate route being responsible for the poisoning of thousands in the years preceding the outbreak.
Halifax 1902 beer poisoning.
Such contamination was tied to an outbreak in the borough of Halifax in January and February 1902 where 13 to 14 cases of arsenic poisoning were noted, three deadly. The moment of the beer's contamination was the malt was dried over a non-sequestered gas coke fire.
Reaction.
After the cause of the poisoning was reported by the media, a considerable reduction in beer consumption was noted in the region.
The response from the brewing industry was mixed. There was a strong, immediate reaction from some breweries, led by the large Manchester brewery Groves and Whitnall, who went as far as sending out telegrams to all the taverns and inns that had purchased their beer. Breweries disposed of thousands of barrels of beer by dumping them in the city's sewers. Other breweries were slower to respond, with fines being handed out to breweries whose beer samples could still be purchased by investigators. Additionally, one pub was fined for selling contaminated beer after they were notified of the presence of arsenic by the manufacturer.
In Lancashire, 23 taverns and pubs were prosecuted for violations under section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875. 
Bostock &amp; Co. went into liquidation, and sued Nicholson &amp; Sons for damages, for breach of an implied condition under the Sale of Goods Act 1893. The case was heard by Mr Justice Bruce in the High Court: the judge awarded Bostock the price of the contaminated acid and the value of their spoiled products, but no special damages for the loss of goodwill or for the damages claimed by the brewers, incurred by using the contaminated product in their sugar's manufacture. Nicholson &amp; Sons survived, and was later acquired by B. Laporte, now Laporte plc.
The poisoning resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission led by Lord Kelvin, which submitted a preliminary report in 1901 and a final report in 1903.
Long-term effects.
The effects on the beer market were short-lived, and consumption of beer resumed over the course of the year. Attempts to revive the pure beer movement were nullified by the Commission's report, and by the fact that arsenic was present in malted barley as well as sugar. There seemed to be no direct effects on legislation resulting from the incident.
In 1901, a considerable decline in the birth rate was noted in Manchester, Salford and Liverpool. This decline was greater in areas most affected, leading the Royal Commission to conclude that the epidemic was the cause.

It was initially described as a new species in 2007 based on specimens collected from Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in eastern Cambodia.
It is similar in appearance to other "Kerivoula" species, but has a genetic divergence of 12%, which was deemed great enough to warrant naming it as a new species.
The species name "titania" is a reference to the character Titania from Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
The authors named the bat after the "Queen of the Fairies" to reflect "the nymph-like nature of this forest bat."
Description.
It is considered a medium-sized member of its genus.
Its forearm is long.
It has large, mostly hairless ears that are long.
It has tall and narrow tragi that are long.
Its tail is long.
It weighs .
Its skull has a distinctly flat appearance.
Its dental formula is for a total of 38 teeth.
Its individual hairs are tricolored: their bases are black, their middles are pale gray, and their tips are dark gray.
Biology and ecology.
It is nocturnal and roosts in sheltered places during the day
Its flattened skull suggests that it roosts in constricted spaces such as under tree bark or in crevices.
Not much is known about its reproduction, but a female in late-stage pregnancy was once documented in early May.
Lactating females have been recorded in mid May and early June.
It is one of the known natural reservoirs of the SARS coronavirus.
In one study in Taiwan, 10% of individuals tested positive for the SARS coronavirus.
Range and habitat.
This species was first described from eastern Cambodia, with additional specimens from Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand.
In 2012, it was first documented in Hainan Island of China and Taiwan.
This discovery made it only the third bat of its genus to be documented in China.
Conservation.
It is currently assessed as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.
It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large range, no major threats to this species have been identified, and it is not likely to be declining quickly.

St Catharine's Convent

St Catharine's Convent in Augsburg, Germany was a community of Dominican nuns.
It was founded in the Am Gries suburb of the city in 1243 before moving into the city centre eight years later. It was dissolved in 1802 and the nuns vacated the monastery in 1807. In 1834 some of the convent buildings were re-used to house the Königliche Polytechnische Schule and a trade school. In 1835 the former convent church was converted into the Staatsgalerie Altdeutscher Meister, a branch of the Bavarian State Painting Collections, which is still there today. In 1877 the building was taken over by a district primary school, now known as the Holbein-Gymnasium.

An Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances)

An Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, also known as Bill C-46, is an act of the Parliament of Canada that was introduced in the House of Commons by Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould in 2017, alongside the "Cannabis Act". The act increases police powers related to impaired driving—including authorizing mandatory alcohol screening, without suspicion that the person is impaired—and it increases the maximum punishments for driving related offences in the Criminal Code.
Provisions.
The act creates a criminal offence related to the concentration of a drug in a person's blood while driving, specific blood concentration levels that would be illegal would be prescribed in regulations by the Governor in Council. If a peace officer suspects that a person has operated a vehicle under the influence of a drug, they would be authorized to order that person to provide a sample of a "bodily substance". The act would further allow a peace officers to demand that a person provide a breath sample, in order to screen for alcohol impairment, without suspicion that the person is impaired.
The act also increases the punishments for driving-related offences. The maximum punishment for offences causing bodily harm would increase from 10 years to 14 years, and offences causing death would increase from 14 years to life in prison. Dangerous driving, failure to stop after an accident, and flight from a peace officer would also see increased maximum sentences—doubling from 5 years to 10 years in prison.
Reception.
The provisions of the act related to alcohol screening have been the subject of debate in the legal community. Rob De Luca of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association argued in the "Toronto Star" that the change would be "a fundamental and troubling change in our legal system [...] the presumption of innocence is replaced with a presumption of guilt", Kathryn Pentz of the Canadian Bar Association argued that it would violate section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and "that it would not withstand constitutional challenge", Senator Serge Joyal argued that it would violate section 9 and 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On the other side of the debate, it has been argued that the change is necessary, reasonable and constitutional. Among the supporters of the act are legal scholars Peter Hogg and Marc Gold. Canada's Privacy Commissioner stated that the act "strikes the appropriate balance from a privacy perspective" and that the government "has made a reasonable case for the necessity and proportionality" of mandatory screening. Among the general public, according to a poll by Nanos Research, 44 percent of respondents support mandatory alcohol screening, while 55 percent oppose it.
Senators Murray Sinclair and Renée Dupuis raised concerns that the act would worsen racial profiling. Sinclair suggested the use of body cameras and record keeping by officers, in order to better monitor police behaviour. Jody Wilson-Raybould responded to concerns by stating that the act "does not change the responsibility that law enforcement has to ensure fair and equal application of the law." An official from the Department of Justice noted that the Minister of Justice would be required to prepare a report on the legislation's success three years after it is passed, and suggested that racial profiling could be reduced through police training.
Concerns have also been raised with regard to the effectiveness of drug screening methods, and possible negative effects the act could have on medical marijuana users. The concerns focus on the length of time THC stays in the body, possibly for days after use, which critics believe could lead to arrests of people who aren't impaired. Jody Wilson-Raybould argued that requiring police officers to have suspicion of impairment, before screening, would serve as "inherent protection to avoid charging drivers who were not actually impaired," and that the screening methods "are consistent with the approach taken in other jurisdictions." Critics have argued that the smell of marijuana in a vehicle could lead an officer to suspect impairment, regardless of whether it has been used by the driver, therefore leading to the requirement being ineffective.
Serge Joyal raised concerns that the act would create additional court challenges and complications, and would not reduce litigation and delays, in the frequently litigated fields of drug-impaired and drunk driving.

Central Buton Regency () is a new regency of Southeast Sulawesi established by separation from Buton Regency under Act No.15 of 2014, dated 23 July 2014. It covers an area of 837.08 km2 comprising the southern parts of Muna Island and Kabaena Island, together with several small offshore islands adjacent to the two main islands. It had a population of 86,112 at the 2010 Census and 114,773 at the 2020 Census. The administrative centre lies at Labungkari.
Administrative districts.
The Central Buton Regency is divided into seven districts ("kecamatan"), tabulated below with their areas and 2010 and 2020 Census populations. The table also includes the administrative centre of each district, the number of administrative villages (rural "desa" and urban "kelurahan") and small offshore islands in each district, and its post code.
The new Regency thus comprises six districts in the southern part of Muna Island together with one district (Talaga Raya) in the southern part of Kabaena Island. It notably does not contain any portion of Buton Island.

Southern Damascus offensive (January–February 2018)

The Southern Damascus offensive (January–February 2018) began on 5 January 2018 as Jaysh al-Islam fighters attempted to infiltrate ISIL positions within the orchards situated in-between Yalda and Hajjar As-Aswad to the immediate south of Damascus city. This resulted in numerous casualties and as such, a week later, on 12 January ISIL shock troops launched a counter-assault on Yalda's Zein neighborhood, triggering heavy clashes, resulting in the eventual capture of several buildings in the area. On 22 January, ISIL made further progress in Taqdam Neighborhood of Hajjar al-Aswad, to this date ISIL ended up controlling 3/4 of Yarmouk Camp, majority of Hajjar al-Aswad, Qadam, Tadamon and large part of Yalda's eastern axis. Fighting continued with ISIL forces continuing their advance against other militant groups later into January, with majority of a street between Yalda and Babbila as well as some gains within the district of Tadamon. By 27 January, ISIL controlled almost the entirety of Hajjar al-Aswad after breaking through the last lines of defense and were on the verge of entering the town of Yalda, during the same time, further areas were also captured in the Yarmouk district.
ISIL fighters managed to make a breakthrough, with the capture of the Halfa neighborhood located in the Yarmouk Camp district, during a short skirmish with Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militants on 13 February. By 16 February, each side had inflicted around 100 casualties on each other. Haifa street and the Al-Malyoun and Al-Mashrou neighborhoods of Yarmouk were also captured by ISIL, while Tahrir al-Sham fighters fell back to their final defensible positions at Ar-Rija Square, which came under attack by ISIL on 17 February. Urban clashes continued on 20 February between ISIL and HTS units west of Yarmouk with ISIL shock troops having seized control of the Al-Wasim mosque block. On the same day, Al-Masdar News reported that HTS had brokered an agreement with the Syrian government to secure the transportation of 160 civilians from the besieged towns of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya within the Idlib Governorate in exchange for safe passage of HTS fighters and their family members from Yarmouk Camp to Idlib.
Aftermath.
On 10 March, ISIL threatened to kill any rebels that evacuate from the area after the Syrian Government gave rebel groups 48 hours of amnesty to leave behind all heavy equipment and either go to the Idlib Governorate or settle their issues with the Syrian Government.
On 13 March ISIL began attacking Syrian Military positions west of the Yarmouk Camp while the rebels in al-Qadam were evacuating. During clashes between SAA and ISIL in al-Qadam opposition groups attempted to break through ISIL lines however failed to do so.

Circus Maximus (Momus album)

Circus Maximus is the debut album by Scottish musician Momus, released on 15 January 1986 on Creation Records. It deals primarily with Biblical and Ancient Roman themes, making reference to figures such as Saul, St. Sebastian, Lucretia, and Solomon. The title, "Circus Maximus", refers to the ancient Roman chariot racing and entertainment venue of the same name.
Background and influences.
"The Guardian" has characterised the lyrical content of "Circus Maximus" as a "skewed reading of certain classical and biblical themes," adding that "the urgent, whispering [Momus] professes himself a masochistic St. Sebastian ('preferring the ache to the aspirin') and sings of 'The Rape of Lucretia' like a Morrissey who had not stopped at an enthusiasm for Oscar Wilde but mined the whole decadent tradition: Pater, Swinburne, Huysmans."
Track listing.
All songs written by Nicholas Currie (Momus).

Ehrgott Bernhard Bendl

Ehrgott or Ehregott Bernhard Bendl, Bendel, Pendel or Pendl (c.1660, Pfarrkirchen - 31 January 1738, Augsburg) was a German sculptor and plaster-worker. He worked in southern Germany and Switzerland in stone, wood, gold, silver, plaster, metal and ivory.
Life.
His father was the sculptor Johann Christoph Bendl, who was in turn the brother of the sculptor Jakob Bendl. He was probably trained in his father's studio until 1678. He then spent six years travelling, visiting Prague, Vienna, Rome and Paris. At that time there was a Johann Georg Bendl in Prague and an Ignaz Innocent Bendl in Vienna, both working as sculptors and both possibly relations of Johann's - he might have trained in their studios on his travels. From 1684 to 1687 he worked in Johann Jakob Rill's studio in Augsburg. He began work in his own right in 1687 and became one of the leading sculptors in Augsburg, holding posts in its guild of sculptors.

The Greatest Story Ever Told (radio program)

The Greatest Story Ever Told is an American old-time radio religious drama. It was broadcast on ABC from January 26, 1947, until December 30, 1956. Beginning July 25, 1948, the program was also broadcast via shortwave radio to 58 other countries by the World Wide Broadcasting Foundation.
"The Greatest Story Ever Told", the title of which was used for Fulton Oursler's 1949 book, used dramatized sketches to depict events in the life of Jesus Christ. As in the book, the words spoken by Jesus in the radio program came directly from the Bible. The premiere episode was "Parable of the Good Samaritan".
The program was sponsored by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, but it lacked commercials, having the sponsorship announced only at the end of each episode. When the broadcast run ended, the affiliation between the program and Goodyear was described as "one of [the] longest institutional broadcast advertising campaigns".
An interdenominational advisory board provided guidance for the show.
Personnel.
Actors on "The Greatest Story Ever Told" performed in anonymity, with no cast credit given. Therefore, few people knew that Warren Parker portrayed Jesus in the program's only continuing role. Norman Rose was the announcer. William Stoess composed the music and initially conducted the 35-piece orchestra, with Jacques Belasco and Willard Young following him as conductors. Young also directed the show's 16-member chorus. Wadill Catchings was the producer; Marx Loeb was the director, and Leonard Blair was Loeb's assistant. With Oursler as consultant, Henry Denker wrote the scripts, which received "screenwriting credit over and above the Oursler book" for the film "The Greatest Story Ever Told" (1965).
Recordings.
In 1950, ABC produced more than 5,000 albums of recordings of selected episodes of "The Greatest Story Ever Told", with half going to the Protestant Radio Commission and half to the National Council of Catholic Men. The Catholic group's albums were distributed to Catholic orphanages, hospitals, and schools. The Protestant group distributed its recording among ministerial groups and councils of churches.
Recognition and critical reception.
City College of New York honored "The Greatest Story Ever Told" as the best radio program created and broadcast in 1947. The recognition noted that the show presented its episodes "with superior good taste and effective listener appeal".
In 1949, "The Greatest Story Ever Told" won a special George Foster Peabody Citation. The citation noted, "... the program has maintained such a high degree of religious integrity, and has been so free of denominational bias or prejudice, that it has won the acclaim of newspapers, magazines, trade journals, and religious leaders alike. ... "The Greatest Story Ever Told" has occupied a peculiar niche, carved by both quality and popularity..." Also in 1949, the Freedoms Foundation named the show Best Radio Program. 
On February 9, 1947, Jack Gould wrote in "The New York Times", ""The Greatest Story Ever Told" is a program of extraordinary beauty and reverence, which without reservation may be listed as one of the most significant ethereal achievements in recent years." He went on to call the show "a rare and successful fusion of religion, art and commerce ..."
Television.
On December 2 and 23, 1951, ABC-TV broadcast episodes of "The Greatest Story Ever Told". The first was "The Story of Lazarus", and the second was "No Room at the Inn".
In 1952, CBS obtained the rights to broadcast a televised version of "The Greatest Story Ever Told", to be sponsored by Goodyear. An article in the trade publication "Billboard" reported that the half-hour program would be broadcast one Sunday afternoon in each of April, May and June 1952, and "it will be shown weekly next season".

Sarah Polk Fall

Sarah "Sallie" Polk Jetton Fall (April 1, 1847 – July 22, 1924) was a wealthy Nashville socialite and philanthropist. She was the great-niece and unofficially adopted daughter of former First Lady Sarah Childress Polk. Sallie's mother died when she was only a few months old. Sallie lived with her great-grandmother, who gave Sallie to her daughter Sarah after the death of Sarah's husband President James K. Polk. 
Sallie was raised at the Polks' private residence Polk Place. She married George Fall in 1865, and they had a daughter Saidee. Sallie inherited the Polk estate upon Sarah's death in 1891, including several artifacts and papers from the late president which she later sold and donated to the Library of Congress. Sarah also willed some of the president's items to Saidee. Shortly before Sallie died in 1924, she and her daughter co-founded the "James K. Polk Memorial Association". In 1929 Saidee worked with the state of Tennessee to acquire the president's home in Columbia which was then opened to the public as a museum. 
Biography.
Sallie Jetton was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee in 1847 to Mary Childress and Robert Jetton, a farmer and land owner. Mary Childress was the daughter of Anderson Childress, the older brother of First Lady Sarah Childress Polk.
Sallie's mother died a few months after her birth from childbirth complications. Her father was unable to raise her alone, so she was taken in by her great-grandmother Elizabeth Childress. She stayed with her great-grandmother for a short period until the death of President James K. Polk in 1849. The president's wife Sarah mourned her husband's death deeply and became a recluse, rarely leaving her home Polk Place. Elizabeth, who was in her 70s, brought Sallie to Polk Place and suggested Sarah should care for her. Sarah agreed and assumed guardianship of Sallie after 1850.
Many who knew Sarah seemed skeptical of her bringing a child into her home. Judge John Catron would make the comment, "You are not the one Madam, to have charge of a little child; you, who have always been absorbed in the political and social affairs..." But nonetheless Sarah still assumed guardianship, and brought in a nurse and maid to watch the young girl. Sarah would often refer to Sallie as her daughter, and newspapers referred to Sallie as her adopted daughter. Sarah would take great pride in raising Sallie. Sallie stayed with Sarah for the rest of the former First Lady's life. In 1865, Sarah hosted Sallie's marriage to George Fall in the main Parlor of Polk Place. The newlyweds moved in with Sarah until after the birth of their child Saidee in 1871. Sarah greatly adored the little girl.
After Sarah's death in 1891 Sallie became the sole heir to the Polk estate as Sarah willed the Polk belongings, the contents of Polk Place along with the presidential papers to Sallie. Sarah bequeathed some of the personal items of the President to Sallie's daughter Saidee, including the president's watch and glasses. Sallie sold and donated the presidential papers to the Library of Congress in the early 1900s. She also donated one of Sarah's inaugural gowns and a fan to the Smithsonian. In 1905 Sallie opened her own home in Nashville for social gatherings to exhibit the items she had inherited from Sarah and to tell the legacy of her great-uncle president Polk. During these gatherings and other social events she would introduce herself as the daughter to the president. Sallie continued living in Nashville after Sarah's death throughout her later life.
Death and legacy.
Sallie fell ill in 1924 and died July 22, at the age of 77. Newspapers throughout the country published "The Adopted daughter of President Polk Dies." The vast majority of the items she did not donate to the Library of Congress or the Smithsonian were left to her daughter, Saidee. Shortly before her death she helped her daughter Saidee found the "James K. Polk Memorial Association" along with other Nashville women, with the main intent of preserving the president's legacy.
In 1929 Sallie's daughter Saidee worked together with the state of Tennessee to purchase the only surviving private residence which the president lived in. The home, located in Columbia, Tennessee, was constructed by the president's father Samuel in 1816, and was the president's home for six years before his marriage to Sarah Childress in 1824. On acquisition of the home in 1929 The "James K. Polk Memorial Association" founded the James K. Polk Home, the presidential museum of James K. Polk. The contents of Polk Place that Sallie inherited and later left to her daughter Saidee would be brought to the museum. Later the fountain, the garden urns, and a gate from the exterior of Polk Place were moved to the property.

Erebia maurisius

Erebia maurisius is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Altai Mountains, Sayan Mountains) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
E. maurisius Esp. (36 e). The reddish brown band of the forewing is separated by the veins into a number of elongate spots — usually 6; the cell is more or less filled in with ferruginous brown, and behind the cross-vein there are 2 somewhat diffuse narrow streaks, which extend towards the distal band, in which they disappear. The hindwing has 6 round russet-yellow spots. On the underside the band of the forewing is lighter, and the space between the band and the darkened base is russet-brown; inner and distal margins blackish brown. The hindwing dark brown in the male, with very small, point-like, russet yellow spots. In the female the hindwing is grey-brown beneath, being finely dusted with greyish yellow, the ochre-yellow dots at the distal margin are prolonged to small stripes. In the cell there is a whitish yellow diffuse spot on the upperside. The fringes grey-brown in the male, whitish grey in the female. Antenna finely ringed, the club white on the inside, black-brown on the outside. Middle of July, on the Altai, from 2000 to 2700 m, on grassy slopes.

Heinrich von Poschinger

Heinrich Joseph Karl Ludwig Ritter und Edler von Poschinger (31 August 1845, Munich, Germany - 10 August 1911, La Bollène, France) was a German writer and historian. A street in the Bismarckviertel quarter of Berlin-Steglitz is named after him.
Life.
He was one of the Poschingers, an old Bavarian family descended from Joachim Poschinger (1523–1599), Gutsherr of Zwieselau (Landkreis Regen) - the family is first documented in 1140. He studied law and philosophy in the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München and later moved to study the same subjects in Berlin. He then returned to Munich, where he graduated. In 1883 he married Margarethe (2 May 1861, Breslau - 1911, La Bollène), daughter of Jakob von Landau, a freiherr and member of the Privy Council of Commerce - she converted to Catholicism in 1883.
He immediately began a job in the Bavarian civil service. In 1876 he moved to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and worked there until 1900, meeting Otto von Bismarck - he became known for publishing Bismarck's political files, letters and talks and writing papers on him as a diarist, economist, parliamentarian, federal councillor and diarist. He also dealt with the estate of president Otto Theodor von Manteuffel. After Bismarck's death, Poschinger left government service and returns to Nice, where he founded a German-language daily newspaper entitled "Riviera-Tageblatt".

Gyalsumdo () is a mostly undocumented Tibetic language spoken by an estimated 200 individuals of the Manang District in the Gandaki Zone of Nepal. In January 2018 the language was added to ISO 639-3 under the code "gyo."
Gyalsumdo is a tonal language; however in Gyalsumdo, unlike most other Central Tibetan languages, the word, rather than the syllable acts as the tone bearing unit. The language is reportedly closely related to the nearby Nubri and Tsum languages which share a large proportion of vocabulary. Gyalsumdo is also described as being somewhat intelligible by speakers of Nar-Phu.

<doc id="56615537" url="?curid=56615537" title="Minol Araki">
Minol Araki

Minol Araki or was a Japanese painter and industrial designer.
Life and education.
Araki was born in Dalian, in Japanese-occupied Kwantung Leased Territory, in 1928. His father owned a restaurant and died when Araki was a teenager. Araki began painting at an early age and at age seven entered the tutelage of an old Chinese painter who his parents were friends with. He studied traditional Chinese painting until moving back to Japan after World War II. He then pursued graphic design and industrial design, and studied under modernist and avant-garde artists in Tokyo. Araki died in 2010.
Work.
Inspired in part by Raymond Loewy's book "Never Leave Well Enough Alone", Araki started a career in industrial design in the 1950s. In the 1960s, he started a network of design studios. During his career as a designer, Araki worked on housewares such as lamps, calendars, and organizers, and byōbu, traditional Japanese folding screens.
In the 1970s, Araki was mentored by painter Zhang Daqian. After Zhang's death, Araki created five paintings demonstrating his mentor's influence and his personal interest in modern Japanese painting methods. These paintings, which are each over 70 feet long, contain multiple panels illustrating landscapes, dragons, and other natural scenes. In addition to influences from Zhang, these paintings also demonstrate influence from Bada Shanren, Ben Shahn, and medieval Japanese Zen painters.
Araki's work was also influenced by his travels, and by painters Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Egon Schiele. Another interest was Pablo Picasso and other contemporary abstract painters. Through various styles, Araki is known for his literati painting and expressing his unique perspective as someone with various cultural influences, both from upbringing and his travels. Araki's best-known piece is "Snow Monkeys at Play in Autumn and Winter", a work that is inspired by the Nihonga painting style of 20th-century Japan. He is also known for a series of lotus paintings.
Unlike most artists, Araki did not collect old paintings, preferring to save antique painting instruments, like brushes, ink and inkstones, and paper. This may have been inspired by his mentor Zhang's work in textile dyeing. For most of his career, Araki did not exhibit or sell any of his pieces. His business work allowed him the financial freedom to pursue his art without having the need to sell it.
On his art, Araki said, "My painting is a celebration of nature, a grateful song to all forms of creation expressed through brush painting. By drawing from both East and West, I hope to achieve a perspective which is international, a bridge between cultures."
Collections.
Araki's work has been exhibited in the collections and/or traveling exhibits of the following:

Advanced work

An advanced work, advance-work or advanced outwork is a fortification or outwork in front of the main defensive building or castle.
In the Middle Ages in the Holy Roman Empire, advanced works, known as Vorwerke (singular: "Vorwerk"), were commonly found in smaller villages that were located in front of the main castle. Within these advanced works often lived relatives of the knightly family whose ancestral seat was in the castle itself. As a result, the advanced works became manor houses and were known locally as "schlosses". They were suitable for defending against minor attacks and offered the village population a degree of protection. In the case of major attacks they also acted as an early warning system for the castle. Because the advanced works were supposed to function autonomously, a link with agricultural estates was possible, such estates then became granges or "vorwerkenden Gutshöfen". Later they also took over administrative tasks. Over the course of time these advanced works detached themselves from the castle and became independent estates.

<doc id="56615544" url="?curid=56615544" title="Emma Jane Gay">
Emma Jane Gay

E. Jane Gay (July 27, 1830 – March 15, 1919) was an American woman who devoted her life to social reform and photography. She is notable for her photographs of the Nez Perce, which she took during a federal expedition led by American ethnologist and anthropologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher.
Early life.
Emma Jane Gay was born in 1830 in Nashua, New Hampshire, to Ziba Gay (1796–1864) and Mary (Kennedy) Gay (1798–1873). She received her education at the Brooklyn Female Academy in New York, where she first befriended Alice Cunningham Fletcher. Gay's education at the Academy included the sciences, religion, and homemaking.
Career.
Gay's first job was as a teacher. In 1856 she accompanied her friend Catherin Melville to Macon, Georgia, to open a school for girls. The school closed in 1860, which prompted Melville and Gay to move to Washington, D.C. to serve as administrators for a school for deaf young children.
From 1861 through 1865, Gay worked as a nurse with Dorothea Dix during the Civil War. After the war, Gay served as a tutor for President Andrew Johnson's grandchildren, then worked as a clerk in a dead letter office. When this job ended in 1883, Gay had a brief period of unemployment.
In 1888, Gay reconnected with Alice Cunningham Fletcher, and they renewed their friendship. She taught herself photography during this time. In 1889, the United States Department of the Interior appointed Fletcher as a special agent to lead an expedition to Nebraska and Idaho, with the intent to apportion tribal lands among the Winnebagos and the Nez Perce as part of the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887.
Gay accompanied Fletcher on this journey as a cook, maid, and secretary. Gay had failed to earn a permit from the federal government to serve as the "official" expedition photographer, but during the expedition she took over 400 photographs of the Nez Perce. In 1909, she worked with her niece to publish the letters written during that expedition, along with half of the photographs, in a two-volume book titled "Choup-nit-ki: With the Nez Percés".
Photography.
Gay's photographs of the Nez Perce have only recently earned critical acclaim. On the surface, the black and white photographs paint a positive image of "civilized" Nez Perce in Western attire, working on farms or ranches, living in cabins and engaging in manual labor. Domesticity appears to be celebrated in these photographs. On the surface, these photographs showed the "success" of the government land appropriation program. Contemporary scholars, however, have noted themes of nationalism, colonialism, and racism in Gay's work. Several photographs feature the white, large Fletcher standing tall while the Nez Perce subjects work in the background or in subservient poses. Gay had also captured the heteronormative gendering of labor, in addition to the racial distribution of labor, in the photographs.
Personal life.
Gay neither married nor had children, but had close ties with her niece and namesake Emma Jane Gay. After the Western expedition she had embarked upon with Fletcher, Gay returned to Washington, D.C., where she and Alice Fletcher shared a house until Gay and Emma traveled to England for an extended stay. With Emma's help, Jane Gay created a scrapbook of edited letters recounting her years in Idaho, illustrated with some of the photographs she had taken, and additional artwork by Emma. Emma, who had studied bookbinding, bound the scrapbook into two volumes and built a wooden case for the work, which was titled "Choup-nit-ki: With the Nez Percés." The unpublished work was later donated to the Schlesinger Library by Jane Gay Dodge. Gay decided to remain in Somerset, England, where she lived with her beloved companion Dr. Caroline Sturge. After World War One, Sturge used some of her inheritance to have a cottage built in
Winscombe, Somerset, where she and Gay could live out their final years; Gay died in this cottage, called "Kamiah", on March 15, 1919.
In multiple texts Gay is referred to as Fletcher's "companion", living in "domestic partnership" or "Boston Marriage" with her. The roles that Gay played during the expedition—as well as the fact that she never married a man and had intimate relationships with other women over the course of her lifetime—have led scholars to believe that she was a lesbian. Due to this fact, art historians identify Gay as the first American lesbian photographer.

Radical Technologies

Radical Technologies is a non-fiction book by the UK-based American author Adam Greenfield. Subtitled 'The design of everyday life' it looks at the technologies that are transforming the world at an ever increasing rate.
Greenfield's take on the influence of technologies such as blockchain and digital fabrication is generally speaking a pessimistic one. He is concerned about the atomisation of society as experience becomes individualised, and about how we are unwittingly handing over vast amounts of power to faceless corporations with very little debate from politicians and other leaders about what we actually want from technology.
In the opening chapter on smartphones for example, whilst marvelling that the entire cartographic knowledge of the world and even our place in it is now available to us on a flat screen that we can hold in our hands, we are for the most part blissfully unaware of all of the interconnected technologies - the NAVSTAR satellite GPS systems, the vast data centres that process the information, the networking and wireless infrastructure that transmit the signals - that allow this functionality to exist. More importantly, Greenfield notes, so quickly has using a smartphone map ceased to be a wonder and become just part of every day live that "we have become reliant on the network to accomplish our ordinary goals".
In the chapter on artificial intelligence (subtitled 'The eclipse of human discretion') Greenfield notes that machines can now do things that were until recently thought to be a uniquely human preserve, such as winning the strategy game Go or creating a highly plausible painting in the style of Rembrandt. In these and other areas where people had the edge, machines can now outperform human beings. AI learns fast and it will not be long before "autonomous algorithmic systems acquire an effectively human level of cognitive ability". What's more, he says, it is difficult to see how this eventuality can be prevented.
The societal effects of automation also come under scrutiny. The most commonly held job in 29 of the 50 US states is truck driver. This will also be one of the first jobs to be automated out of existence. What will happen to the truck drivers then, the author asks.
The book concludes with four possible scenarios that might play out as automation plays an increasing role in the mediation of every aspect of life.
Critical reception.
Radical technologies received positive reviews. "The Guardian" described it as “A tremendously intelligent and stylish book on the ‘colonization of everyday life by information processing'”, while Jennifer Howard in "The Times Literary Supplement" said it “provides a grounded guide, a cautionary tale in which each chapter walks readers through another layer of a dazzling and treacherous landscape”. Brian Eno described as it an “essential book”.

Christoph Langenmantel

Christoph Langenmantel or "Christoph Langenmantel vom Sparren" (1488, in Augsburg – 17 May 1538, in Ingolstadt) was a nobleman, Carmelite friar, canon of Freising and a supporter of Martin Luther.
Family.
He was from the Langenmantel vom Sparren family, an Augsburg patrician family. His parents were mayor Georg Langenmantel vom Sparren (born 1521) and Anna née Ilsung. Georg was highly valued by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and served in his war against Venice. In 1520 he travelled with Konrad Peutinger to Bruges to welcome Charles V on behalf of the city.
Christoph's brother Sigmund (died 1545) was a judge and pfleger in Kelheim, where his epitaph survives in the Pfarrkirche Mariä Himmelfahrt. Another brother, Ulrich (died 1570) worked on the councils of Bavaria and Baden-Baden as well as hofmeister and one of the Catholic guardians of count Philibert.
His sister Maria was a Benedictine nun at Holzen Abbey and was its abbess between 1538 and 1553.
Charitas, another sister, became abbess of Marienstein Abbey in 1544 and there received the Benedictine nuns from Bergen Abbey near Neuburg an der Donau, expelled by Otto Henry, Elector Palatine.
His father's brother was Johann IX. Langenmantel vom Sparren (died 1505), longtime mayor of Augsburg and Knight of the Golden Spurs. His great-uncle was Ulrich Langenmantel, stiftpropst to the Völkermarkt in Carinthia and founder of the first Studienstiftung in Augsburg.
Life.
From October 1500 he studied in the University of Ingolstadt and from May 1506 at the University of Tübingen. From 1510 he was treasurer and cupbearer to Matthäus Lang, the bishop of Gurk and later a cardinal. He entered the Carmelite order and belonged to the St Anna Abbey in Augsburg as well as later becoming a priest-canon at Freising Cathedral.
After the Diet of Augsburg Martin Luther had to appear at the Fuggerhäuser in 1518 before cardinal Thomas Cajetan to answer for his 95 theses. He arrived in the city on 7 October and left on 20 October - during his stay he lived in the same abbey as Langenmantel, who took care of him and gave him advice. On 12–14 October negotiations took place between Luther and Cajetan, but he refused to revoke his theses, putting him in real danger of arrest. Christoph's father Georg was then serving as mayor and on the night of 19–20 October Christoph led Luther through a secret gate in the city wall to escape. According to tradition, Christoph said "Da hinab" ("Down there") when they reached the gate - it is still named after that phrase, as recorded in an inscription there. Luther sent him a letter of thanks from Wittenberg on 25 November 1518.
Despite his sympathy for Luther and his concerns, Christoph Langenmantel did not convert to Protestantism.

Erebia wanga

Erebia wanga is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Amur) that belongs to the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
E. tristis Brem. (= wanga Brem.) (35c). Very similar to the preceding "E. cyclopius", with which it agrees in size, shape and ground-colour. The yellow border of the double ocellus is narrower and somewhat dull in the male, and broader and light yellow in the female. The border of the ocellus is yellow on the underside of both sexes, being broader than above. The hindwing beneath is thinly dusted with whitish in the male and bears a small white spot at the apex of the cell. In the female the underside of the hindwing is more densely dusted with whitish, the dark dentate median band therefore being more prominent than in the male, in which sex it contrasts but little with the ground. Before the distal margin there is an arched, narrow, dark dentate line, proximally to which there is a small white dot each in cellules 2 and 4. The antenna thinly ringed black and white, club above black, the tip and underside russet -yellow. The specimens from Blagovestshensk larger than those from Raddefka.

Gessner Harrison

Gessner Harrison (June 27, 1807 – April 7, 1862) was an American educator, author, and college administrator during the antebellum era. He was appointed by James Madison as an associate professor of ancient languages at the University of Virginia (1828–1859). Harrison was recognized for teaching the fundamentals of the classics as well as linguistics, and for advancing these in his publications. He often served as chairman of the faculty and was required to address years of riotous student behavior.
Harrison entered the university as an undergraduate in its initial year of operation (1825). He had been raised as a staunch Christian, and while his devotion invited the reproval of many classmates, it once occasioned a compliment from the university's founder, Thomas Jefferson. He excelled academically and graduated with doctorates in Medicine and Ancient Languages; his classmates included Edgar Allan Poe. In 1828 he became the first alumnus to join the faculty there, at age twenty-one.
Harrison's work in comparative grammar, articulated in his text "Exposition of Latin Grammar", was on a par with the leading scholars at German and English schools. He served as chairman of the university faculty for over a third of his thirty-year tenure. As such he responded to multiple violent encounters with disorderly students by whom he and others were assaulted, and by whom one professor was murdered. In collaboration with the university's board, he instituted a code of conduct and played a key role in the reclamation of campus civility.
In 1859 Harrison retired from the university and started a prep school, the Locust Grove Academy, in nearby Nelson County. He was a slaveholder and supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War. By 1862, with the school suffering from a war-diminished student body, he found himself nursing a son returned home from the conflict. He contracted the young man's illness, was forced to close the school, and died soon thereafter. Harrison's death was considered a notable loss for education in the South. He was a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia.
Family and early education.
Gessner Harrison was born June 26, 1807, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, a city founded by his ancestors in 1780. He was the second of seven children of physician Dr. Peachy Harrison and Mary Stuart. His father served as Rockingham County Sheriff and was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates (1816–1817). He was also a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830. Gessner began school at four years of age and was studying Latin by age eight. His father was a devout Methodist Christian, and several of Harrison's teachers were noted ministers, all of whom influenced his own devotion. He became an avid reader and was drawn to the library.
College years.
When Harrison began college at age 18, he was described as "less than striking" in appearance, "below middle height," and "his face, though engaging, was rather homely." He was among the earliest enrollees for the premier term of the University of Virginia in 1825—his older brother Edward and friend Henry Tutwiler entered as well.
As opposed to other educators who assigned to their programs a distinct role for religion, Thomas Jefferson, the university's founder, and author of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, felt that religious activities and studies at the school should be voluntary. This did not deter the pious Harrison or his father regarding Harrison's attendance. On the other hand, Harrison's religious convictions did in one instance have their effect. Jefferson regularly invited students to Monticello for dinner on Sundays, but when the invitation was extended to Harrison and his brother, they explicitly declined, as dutiful Christians, in order to avoid a desecration of the Sabbath and a betrayal of their father. Jefferson was moved by this, and as Broadus relates, he sent them a note to the effect that it gave him "the highest gratification and consolation in old age, to meet with such an instance of filial piety; to find young men showing such respect for their father’s opinions, at a time when too many of the young are inclined to disregard the counsels of age and the wishes of parents." Jefferson ended the note with an invitation to join him for dinner during the week, which the brothers accepted.
As a student, Harrison balked at the use of profanity and lewd behavior, and this readily brought a degree of isolation from his contemporaries, particularly the more truculent students. Some even resented his attitude, but as he told his father, "their enmity is better infinitely than their friendship purchased at the high price of virtue."
Harrison followed his father's example and undertook medical courses though he found they presented him with a difficult challenge; nevertheless, he received an M.D. degree in 1827. He also took courses in the Ancient Languages department, headed by Prof. George Long; he distinguished himself in Latin, Greek, and French and was awarded an LL.D. in 1828. His classmates in Senior Latin and French included Edgar Allan Poe. When Long left the school the same year, he recommended Harrison as his successor, saying the school should "not find it necessary to apply to England for that which they already possess."
Marriage and family.
Harrison and Eliza Lewis Carter Tucker (1808–1893) were married December 15, 1830. Her father was George Tucker, then professor of Moral Philosophy at the university, following oddly a lifestyle of social and financial delinquencies. Tucker's wife was Maria Carter, a grandniece of George Washington. Harrison and wife had ten children, three of whom married university professors and joined their parents as residents of Jefferson's "Academical Village;" amongst them was women's rights advocate Mary Stuart Smith (1834–1917).
In letters to his friend Tutwiler, Harrison made repeated reference to the happiness that was his in the company of his wife and children. According to biographer and colleague Broadus, as a husband and father, Harrison “was of great courage, both physical and moral,” but possessed “a delicate consideration for the feelings of others;” he preferred a quiet, self-disciplined, erudite life. He worked tirelessly, but took time to nurture his love of art, nature, poetry, and music.
Harrison was a vested member of the Southern upper-class; in 1860 he held about nine slaves, and considerable assets as well—real estate valued at $42,000 and other property of $25,842. He at one time conducted a Sunday school for his and other local slaves.
Teaching career.
First year.
The rector of the university, James Madison, in 1828 appointed Harrison to a one-year term as Associate Professor of Ancient Languages—he was the first graduate of the university to become a professor. As he sought to find his place among the older, esteemed faculty members, handpicked by Jefferson and Madison, Harrison endeavored to overcome his feeling of inferiority.In a letter to Prof. Long, he confessed he felt ill-equipped in "converting my stock of information, which is not the greatest, into a useful instruction to my class," and lamented his "many deficiencies" as a professor. But by the end of his term he had performed sufficiently to receive an extension of his appointment.
Age of discontents.
Harrison's teaching career for a time coincided with an extended period of student rebellion at the university and at a number of colleges and universities across the country. He and his colleagues were challenged early to control unruly, sometimes riotous students. The behavioral problems were in large part due to the faculty maintaining a narrow focus upon lessons and examinations, to the exclusion of personal interaction with their students.
In 1830 some students were creating a disturbance outside Harrison's home; he accused one, apparently drunk, of using "improper language." The student later demanded an apology, cursed and assaulted Harrison, and was expelled. Over the course of the next decade, professors' homes were vandalized and they were repeatedly confronted by student criminals armed with weapons and using profane, violent language. On one occasion Harrison was confronted in his office by a cursing student with weapon drawn.
In 1839 Harrison was the victim of an egregious assault at the hands of two students, Thomas Russell and William Binford, who had just been expelled for “gross violations” of university rules. They blamed Harrison, as the faculty chairman, and the two accosted him as he was leaving the lecture hall. Binford then restrained him while Russell proceeded to strike him with a horsewhip. Another student finally intervened and halted the attack, but when Harrison rebuked the perpetrators, they renewed the whipping before ultimately fleeing the city on horseback.
Harrison dealt with misbehaving students in a "straightforward, downright way, using direct but kind speech." His own children's interactions with him were conducted with "passionate fondness and unalterable reverence."
Broadus indicates that the university board adopted, and Harrison as faculty chairman executed, "a method of discipline, combining liberty and law, which in judicious hands was attended with admirable results." This new discipline included a curfew, a dress code, and allowance restrictions. Virginius Dabney indicates that the changes, at least initially, only made things worse—the students' criminal behavior further deteriorated in 1840, when Prof. John A. G. Davis was shot and murdered by a student. Harrison thus described the event: Professor Davis in the vigor of health, and in the meridian of life, was shot down before his own door-sill in the wantonness of ruffian malice, when he had no suspicion of danger, was without the means of injury or defense, and when his only provocation was an unsuccessful attempt to discover who had disturbed his domestic peace and violated the laws of the University. The campus atmosphere did eventually improve markedly as a result of the measures which Harrison and the board initiated.
Laying foundations and beyond.
When Harrison encountered students with poor classics preparation in the lecture hall, he insisted that language fundamentals not be neglected, even at the expense of developing more advanced concepts. This proclivity earned him a frequent invocation by the students of their dysphemism, "Old Gess's humbuggery."
Harrison once lamented to a successor, "I suspect you'll have a lot such as mine; you will spend your life clearing the ground and laying foundations, mostly out of sight, on which more fortunate men shall build." Broadus states that he thereby asserted that education only worked its way from higher to lower. Graduate teachers were proven incrementally more skillful. Each cohort in turn sent up students who were more qualified in the basics. Thus, Harrison and colleagues could gradually raise the standard of expertise in each field. One younger colleague affirmed, "I hardly know how we could get on at all if it were not for what Dr. Harrison did before us."
His earliest published work, "Geography of Ancient Italy and Southern Greece", illustrates his emphasis on fundamentals. In the syllabus, Harrison included history, in order to show that the physical and historical peculiarities of Italy and Greece contributed to the character of the people and the formation of their languages. He was forced to condense the material to reduce printing costs, but the enterprise still lost money. As Broadus opined, the profitable business of publishing proved not to be his strong suit.
Harrison also explored new concepts in his discipline. The modern Science of Language had recently begun in Germany, seeking to expand the academic study of Latin and Greek usage beyond that of elemental facts, expanding the discipline with "rational explanation and philosophical systemization." Harrison supported the advance of this scientific approach in American comparative grammar, eventually applying its principles to the striking similarities between the ancient Sanskrit language of India and that of Latin and Greek.
According to Prof. Basil Gildersleeve and biographer Merrow E. Sorley, Harrison's keen interest led him to promote several innovative principles even before they were taken up by the German or English schools. Harrison's own "Exposition of Latin Grammar" was described as "an excellent work" by German Prof. Georg Curtius, the preeminent scholar in the study of comparative grammar at the time. Curtius' own work on the subject followed six years after Harrison's material was first printed for use in an 1839 University of Virginia classroom.
Harrison's later "Treatise on Greek Prepositions" was said to be a prime example of his philosophical, inductive approach. Broadus maintained in 1870 that the work made its author a decidedly eminent contributor in the field of philology. While Harrison's colleagues had praise for these works, their very specialized nature limited the circle of interested readers, and sales barely covered expenses.
Finally, Harrison was able to use his medical studies to articulate the relationship of vocal anatomy to language patterns. “To see the Professor exemplifying with his own organs the mode of formation of palatals, linguals, and labials was a standing amusement" to both students and colleagues.
Style of teaching and leadership.
Harrison's lecture style was reputedly more engaging than his writing style, which was dismissed as "scarcely felicitous." As a lecturer he was intent upon clarity, with an ability to discern the comprehension among his audience. He had no hesitancy to revisit a point from varied angles as necessary until learned. Owing to the sometimes tedious nature of his subject, he was ready to employ a spontaneous, homespun humor, which on occasion became “as racy as it was peculiar.”
Harrison's professorial work ethic was self-defeating over time, as he failed to limit his workload to a manageable size. As a result, he suffered from a procrastination that became increasingly habitual. His review of examinations became last-minute, occasionally imprecise, affairs. His reports to the faculty as chairman became ill-prepared, oral presentations, rather than the prescribed written ones. Over-commitments also eliminated his potential for social life and travel. They were deemed invaluable for an educator, who was believed to profit from an exchange of ideas and a personal review of events beyond that provided by newspapers and periodicals. Harrison lamented these shortcomings and their effect on his professional development throughout his career. 
Nevertheless, over his thirty years on the university faculty, Harrison proved himself to be a “...deeply earnest and conscientious professor...And those who knew him best had the greatest confidence in his judgment.” He taught Latin and Greek, published three books (1834, 1852, 1858), served as faculty secretary (1831–1832), and was faculty chairman (1837–1839, 1840–1842, 1847–1850, 1851–1854). In 1856 the board of visitors revamped his department, limiting his courses to Latin exclusively.
Retirement and final years.
Harrison was forced to confront an inability to make ends meet on his $3,000 annual salary, in light of the expenses of his considerably large family. In an effort to solve this, in 1858 he set out to follow the example of retired Alabama professor Henry Tutwiler, who had established a profitable boarding school; to this end, he tendered his resignation to the board of visitors. A majority of the board resolved to retain him, and removed his salary cap, offering him the entire proceeds from his classes. Harrison withdrew the resignation, until it became clear there had arisen a fissure on the board as to the arrangement. He resubmitted his resignation and retired from the university in 1859. The faculty responded to his departure, formally resolving that "he had done more than any other man for the cause of education and sound learning in his native state." That year the students presented him with a silver pitcher and goblets "as a Memorial of their high regard and esteem;" they are still used at university library events.
Harrison proceeded to purchase land in nearby Nelson County, and there instituted the Locust Grove Academy, where he enrolled 100 boys, some of them sons of former students from the university. After he successfully initiated the third school term, the Civil War disrupted his plans—by the end of 1861 half of his students had left school to join the Confederate army. Harrison's establishment of the academy was over-leveraged, with the result that there was little leeway when tuition receipts dropped.
Harrison maintained his loyalty to slavery and the South. All of his then adult sons joined the Confederate army; one, Charles Carter, returned home in 1861 with camp fever, and Harrison assumed the role of caregiver. Over the years his own health had diminished, and though he nursed his son back to health, Harrison contracted the disease. He was forced to close his school and died soon thereafter on April 7, 1862; he was buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery.
Legacy.
He fell amid the storm of war. Three years earlier and the death of Gessner Harrison would have stirred the entire South. The journals of every state would have included tributes from many an admiring and grateful pupil...And so it is likely that the young of today can scarcely believe, the old can with little difficulty recall, how widely known and how highly honored and admired, how warmly loved, was this mere civilian, the quiet and unpretending professor of 1859.
 He was perhaps the most important figure in the educational history of the Southern States in the period before the Civil War.

Power Rangers Beast Morphers

Power Rangers Beast Morphers are the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh seasons of the American television program "Power Rangers". The first season premiered on Nickelodeon on March 2, 2019, while the second season premiered on February 22, 2020.
"Beast Morphers" was the first in the television series to be produced by Hasbro's production studio Allspark (which was later absorbed into Entertainment One in October 2020), as well as being the first in the franchise to have all toys manufactured and distributed by Hasbro. Both seasons were produced using footage, costumes, and props from the thirty-sixth entry in the Japanese long-running tokusatsu drama Super Sentai series, "Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters" which aired in 2012. As a result, "Beast Morphers" marks the first time the American series has adapted an entry in the "Super Sentai" series that was previously skipped over. The series also serves as a direct sequel to "Power Rangers RPM".
"Beast Morphers" was originally to be produced by Saban Brands. During pre-production, Hasbro acquired the "Power Rangers" franchise and other entertainment assets from Saban Brands and the latter company subsequently closed on July 2, 2018.

Scientists in the city of Coral Harbor have discovered a way to convert the infinite power of the Morphin Grid into a physical substance called "Morph-X", providing the city with a source of unlimited clean energy. To protect the city, a secret agency known as Grid Battleforce combines Morph-X with animal DNA to create a new team of Power Rangers. Now the Beast Morpher Rangers: Devon Daniels, Ravi Shaw, and Zoey Reeves must defend the Morphin Grid from Evox, an evil sentient computer virus from another dimension and his evil avatar clones of original Beast Morphers candidates Blaze and Roxy, who were rendered comatose. After the three of them are transported to the Cyber Dimension, Evox, Cybervillain Blaze, and Cybervillain Roxy gain its de facto ruler Scrozzle as an ally as he helps them in their plan to return Evox to Earth. 
As the Rangers battle Evox's robot monsters, they gain two new additions to the team: Nate Silva, the head researcher and scientist of Grid Battleforce who becomes the Gold Ranger and Steel, a robot Nate was forced to create as a body for Evox, who gains sentience and becomes the Silver Ranger.
In the second season, Evox possesses Mayor Daniels and plots to finish what he started with the help of Scrozzle, who uses a machine to revive the Blaze and Roxy avatars as robots. Along the way, the Rangers uncover Evox's true origins and receive help from the original, Dino Thunder, and Dino Charge Rangers as well as allies of the RPM Rangers to defeat Evox and his minions once and for all.
Production.
Saban Brands announced on February 12, 2018, that it had renewed its partnership with Nickelodeon for an additional three years now going until 2021.

Île de Mateba

Île de Mateba "(Mateba Island)" is the major river island close to the river mouth of the great Congo river. The entire island lies within the DR Congo, whereas the southern river shore lies in Angola. There are at least two villages on the island, one on the island's south coast and one on the north coast.
Controversial wildlife introductions.
On the Mateba Island, Blue wildebeest, Waterbuck, Burchell's zebras and even giraffes have been introduced by the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature. The animals where imported from Namibia in partnership with "Wildlife Vets Namibia". This move is controversial because Mateba Island is historically a rainforest reserve. And the partly savanne which occurs now is a result of deforestation. All founder populations established well except the 4 giraffes which died within 3 weeks of offloading due to the absence of Acacia trees like 
Vachellia and Senegalia.

The 1989–90 Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team represented Loyola Marymount University during the 1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Lions were led by fifth-year head coach Paul Westhead. They played their home games at Gersten Pavilion in Los Angeles, California as members of the West Coast Conference.
Powered by consensus Second-Team All-Americans Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, LMU led the nation in scoring for the third consecutive year and established an NCAA record of 122.4 points per game. Kimble won the NCAA individual scoring title by averaging 35.3 points per game.
On March 4, 1990, Gathers collapsed and died during a WCC Tournament Semifinal matchup against Portland. The team is remembered for honoring Gathers with a run to the Elite Eight as the 11 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament. The Lions defeated New Mexico State 111–92, defending National Champion Michigan 149–115, and Alabama 62–60 before falling 131–101 to UNLV, the eventual National Champions.

Eugene L. Grant

Eugene Lodewick Grant (February 15, 1897 – July 9, 1996), was an American civil engineer and educator. He graduated with a BS from the University of Wisconsin in 1917. He started teaching in 1920 at Montana State University and then in 1930 at the School of Engineering, Stanford University where he taught until 1962. He is known for his work in Engineering Economics with his textbook first published in 1930. Grant was the intellectual heir of work performed by John Charles Lounsbury Fish who published Engineering Economics: First Principles in 1923, providing the critical bridge between Grant and the pioneering effort of Arthur M. Wellington in his engineering economics work of the 1870s.
Grant was awarded many academic and professional honors such as an honorary doctorate in civil engineering at Montana State University; Fellow of the American Statistical Association, American Society for Quality(ASQ) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science as well as membership in the National Academy of Engineering in 1987. He was part of the effort to found the American Society for Quality which awarded Grant its top award, the Shewhart Medal in 1952. In 1967, ASQ created the E.L. Grant Award which is granted annually to the individual who has been deemed to have demonstrated outstanding leadership in the areas of educational programs in quality. Joseph Juran said that Grant was a "quiet doer who didn’t receive enough credit for what he did" and did much to advance the field of quality to what it was in the middle of the 20th century.
Early life and career.
Eugene Lodewick Grant was born on February 15, 1897, in Chicago, Illinois, to Bertrand Eugene and Eva May (Lodewick). In 1923, he married Mildred Brooks Livingston and they had one child, Nancy Livingston. He attended University of Wisconsin and graduated in 1917 with a Bachelor of Science in civil engineering. Grant saw wartime service in the United States Navy and then later served in the Geological Survey. Grant then joined the civil engineering faculty at the University of Montana (Bozeman) in 1920. He earned a Master's degree in economics at Columbia University in 1928.
Stanford University civil engineering department.
Grant joined the department in 1930 which was headed at the time by fellow engineering economist John Charles Lounsbury Fish where Grant started on his landmark textbook on engineering economy. He later became chair of the civil engineering department in 1947. He headed that from 1947 to 1956 while at the same time heading the Committee on Industrial Engineering which later became an independent engineering program at Stanford.
Principles of Engineering Economy.
Following the pioneering work of Fish, Grant published his text on engineering economy with the first edition printed in 1930. Grant improved on Fish's work by presenting methods for short-run analyses complementing the long run methods championed by Fish and A. M. Wellington in their earlier works. The book was grouped into three parts: "The Arithmetic of Engineering Economy," "Fact Finding in Economy Studies," and "Background for Economy Studies." Initial reviews of his book noted that Grant's work addressed "...the difficulties in reducing costs and income in different periods to a comparable basis-difficulties which are too commonly neglected by economists." Grant succeeded in making economics "realistic... an unusually good combination of text and case material." Other reviewers noted that his book was very useful for the study of public utilities in its treatment of the "...cost problems of public service industries (such as) the economies of maximum capacity... The most advantageous load, plant, and capacity factors..."
In 1938, Grant published the 2nd edition of his book. He reorganized the book into four parts, Planning Economy Studies to Solve Engineering Problems, Interest—The Time Element in Economy, Techniques for Economy Studies and Getting Results from Economy Studies. Grant noted in his preface to the 2nd edition that his book emphasized two points as its core themes:
One reviewer of this 2nd edition noted that Grant's work was important and represented a specialized analytical approach to address the special problem of choosing alternatives. It helped that Grant's work avoided "involved mathematics".
Over the next fifty years, six more editions would be printed with the last, the 8th, printed in 1990. In 1982, the Accounting Historians Journal in an article on the historical development of traditional net present value (NPV) method with the equivalent annual cost (EAC) methods noted that the role that Grant's book on engineering economy played in the development of discounted cash flow techniques. Jones, et. al. noted that this development intersected the "...fields of engineering, economics, and accounting".
Equivalence.
Grant introduced the concept of economic equivalence in his first edition of the Principles book noting that "...(a)n "equivalent" figure is one which is convertible into a given figure by the application of the proper compound interest factor. Thus the notion of equivalence requires the assumption of an interest rate." Grant looked at interest as an economic sacrifice in order to determine whether or not to make the investment. He noted that accounting systems never included "...interest on the ownership capital as a cost; interest is only a cost when it is paid out."
In his revised 2nd edition, he added a whole chapter devoted to the subject defining economic equivalence as the concept that investments or payments which differ in total magnitude and made at different dates may be substituted for each other to make a fair comparison in economic studies. As Grant noted in his first edition, this required a broader definition of interest that used in accounting.
Basic Accounting and Cost Accounting.
In 1956, Grant published "Basic Accounting and Cost Accounting" as a text for introductory courses for nonaccounting majors and intended for those persons who weren't professional accountants. Grant argued in the book that accounting should be viewed as a prerequisite for good citizenship. 
Grant's approach was to involve the student "...deeply in the mechanics of record keeping and the accounting process...(as opposed to newer ones that) ... puts more stress on the uses of accounting information than on its synthesis." The book was grouped into three parts: "Accounting Fundamentals," "Elements of Cost Accounting," and "Some Accounting Topics." In the later part, Grant wrote a chapter entitled "Some hazards in the uncritical use of accounting figures" in which he articulated some general principles on making decisions in business; arguing that fundamentally, business decisions are between "...alternative courses of action." Critical to this process was developing "...a clear definition of the alternatives to be considered." Grant argued that the rational basis for such business decision-making was an ability to "...predict the consequences of choosing among the various alternatives...and it is only prospective differences among those alternatives that influence the choice...(all other matters)...are irrelevant." Where "...probable consequences of proposed alternatives..." were expressed in terms of money, namely "relevant costs". Crucially, Grant noted that in such business decision-making, all relevant differences in terms of cost are future ones as past events cannot be "changed by a decision made today." Lastly, Grant argued that no rational business decision regarding the "proposed investments of money could be made without recognizing the time value of money." Unlike accounting which doesn't recognize a cost unless money is borrowed, economics recognized this as an opportunity cost.
While one reviewer stated that "Mr. Grant has written a fine introduction to conventional accounting and cost principles for "non-accountants..." another criticized Grant's use of "...accounting-cycle illustrations in so many chapters as focal points for introducing basic techniques..." because it made for a difficult presentation for the students. This reviewer noted that Grant excluded classical accounting subjects such as "accounting systems, data processing, and internal control; assembling accounting data to aid managerial decision- making; internal and external auditing." In summary, the book was criticized as a "...condensation rather than a distillation of basic accounting and cost accounting principles and techniques ... (and) ... the use of long involved problems to illustrate fundamental principles combine to make the book an inefficient teaching and learning tool."
Personal life.
Since 1966, Grant resided in Palo Alto, California.
On July 9, 1996, Grant died at Channing House in Palo Alto, California. Grant was 99.
 Grant is interred at Sunset Hills Cemetery Memorials in Bozeman, Gallatin County, Montana, USA. At the time, he was professor emeritus of economics of engineering in the department of industrial engineering at Stanford University. He was a recognized leader and pioneer in applying economic analysis to engineering problems. His work on statistical quality control was an integral part of the effort to improve production in industrial plants during World War II. A colleague of Grant's noted that:

Hart Hill is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest north-west of Charing Kent. It is a Geological Conservation Review site.
This site is controversial as it exposes the Lenham Beds, the date of which has been disputed, but they are now thought to be Pliocene, on the basis of their marine bivalves and gastropods.
There is no access to the site, which has been built on, but geology is visible from the Pilgrims' Way.

Craigton Cemetery

Craigton Cemetery is a cemetery in south-west Glasgow dating from the mid-19th century. It stands on Berryknowes Road.
The cemetery has a Jewish section containing 230 graves. The cemetery also contains 251 commonwealth war graves from the First and Second World Wars.
Partly due to the proximity to Ibrox Stadium, the cemetery has strong links to Rangers Football Club.
The original entrance is to the south-east. A new entrance to the north was created to serve the crematorium. The north half of the cemetery is relatively flat and open. The south half slopes fairly steeply south to north and is more densely filled with monuments.
Vandalism in the cemetery is widespread.
History.
The cemetery was established in 1871 by the Craigton Cemetery Company to serve south-west Glasgow, Govan and Partick. The original cemetery extended to 30 acres on lands of Wester Craigton and Merrylands, previously owned by Robert Urquhart. The main shareholder was Thomas Reid (1831-1900) of the Govan Dye Works. Fellow directors included Morris Pollok (1831-1899) and William McOnie (1813-1894) (later Lord Provost of Glasgow).
The first burial took place on 9 June 1873, being that of seven-year-old Isabella Guthrie.
From 1876 to 1877 various reburials took place moving earlier graves from Blackfriars Churchyard which was removed for railway improvements.
From 1881 the cemetery also permitted Jewish burials in their own section known as the "Bet Chaim" (House of Life). This section was closed in 1908.
Craigton Crematorium lies close to the northern boundary and was added in 1957 to a design by James Maitland Steel. It is currently run by the Co-op Funeralcare.
The cemetery contains over 150,000 persons.

Microtis alboviridis

Microtis alboviridis, commonly known as the scented mignonette orchid or ghost mignonette orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to forty or more small, greenish-white, sweetly scented flowers. It is similar to the white mignonette orchid ("M. alba") but has smaller flowers and flowers abundantly in the absence of fire.
Description.
"Microtis alboviridis" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between eight and forty or more greenish-white flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long, wide and as with many others in the genus, are sweetly scented. The flowers are similar to those of "Microtis alba", but apart from being small, the flowers have an upturned tip on the labellum and the labellum has smaller lobes. Flowering occurs from November to December and is not stimulated by fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis alboviridis" was first formally described in 2008 by Robert John Bates and the description was published in "The Orchadian". The specific epithet ("alboviridis") is derived from the Latin words "albus" meaning "white" and "viridis" meaning "green".
Distribution and habitat.
The scented mignonette orchid is found in a range of habitats from seasonally wet flats to forest and occurs between Mount Lesueur and Israelite Bay, sometimes growing in populations of thousands of individuals.
Conservation.
"Microtis alboviridis" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Samuel Ademulegun

Samuel Adesujo Ademulegun was a Nigerian officer in the Nigerian army. He was Commander of the No 1 brigade in 1966, and attained the military rank brigadier-general.
Early life and family.
He was born on 20th October 1924 in Ondo town, south western Nigeria, and was considered one of the country's finest officers at the time. The son of Mr. and Mrs. Michael Ademulegun, he had his early education in Ondo state before joining the Nigerian Army as a private in 1942.Brigadier Samuel Ademulegun was married to Mrs. Latifat Feyisitan Abike Ademulegun [nee Noble] who was also known as ‘Sisi Nurse' and was also killed cold-bloodedly during the coup. He was survived by his daughter Mrs. Solape Ademulegun-Agbi, Bankole, Kunle, Gbenga, Goke and his oldest son Frank Bamidele who later enlisted into the Nigerian Air Force where he rose to the rank of Group Captain before his death in 2002.
Career life.
Ademulegun was commissioned in 1949, and was one of the senior Officer Corps of the army along with Aguiyi Ironsi, Zakariya Maimalari and Babafemi Ogundipe. He was among those vying for the top army post of GOC in 1965 upon the retirement of the expatriate GOC. He was considered friendly with Ahmadu Bello which brought distaste to some junior officers who frowned at their commander fraternizing with politicians.
His death.
He and his wife were killed in the 1966 coup when coupists led by Timothy Onwuatuegwu, an instructor at the Nigerian Military Training College barged into his room and was shot dead on his bed. In an eye witness account of the murder of Samuel Ademulegun in an interview by his daughter, Mrs. Solape Ademulegun-Agbi, she narrates how her father was killed by military officers. Her account provides details of the invasion and gruesome murder of the former General Officer Commanding (GOC), 1st Division in Kaduna state. Killed in what is considered Nigeria's first coup, the perpetrators are recorded to believe to be ridding the country of corrupt politicians and those who were close to them.

Kramers–Moyal expansion

In stochastic processes, Kramers–Moyal expansion refers to a Taylor series expansion of the master equation, named after Hans Kramers and José Enrique Moyal. This expansion transforms the integro-differential master equation 
where formula_2 (for brevity, this probability is denoted by formula_3) is the transition probability density, to an infinite order partial differential equation
where
Here formula_6 is the transition probability rate. The Fokker–Planck equation is obtained by keeping only the first two terms of the series in which formula_7 is the drift and formula_8 is the diffusion coefficient.
Pawula theorem.
The Pawula theorem states that the expansion either stops after the first term or the second term. If the expansion continues past the second term it must contain an infinite number of terms, in order that the solution to the equation be interpretable as a probability density function.

Spanish ship Europa

Europa was a late 18th-century third-rate ship of the line of the Spanish Navy. She was launched in 1789 and served in the Armada Real for 11 years before being abandoned as a wreck in Manila Harbor in 1801.
History.
Europa was laid down at the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro shipyards in Ferrol, Spain in 1789. She was designed by Spanish naval architect José Romero y Fernández de Landa as a third-rate, two decked seventy-four gun ship of the line. Following her completion, "Europa" joined the Spanish European Fleet. After several years of service, "Europa" was reassigned to service in the Pacific, and so she departed Spain for Concepcion, Chile, arriving in February 1796. She departed Concepcion for Manila in the Spanish Philippines on 10 October 1796 accompanied by her fellow third-rates "Montañes" and "San Pedro" along with two 34-gun frigates, "Pilar" and "Fama."
Pacific service.
Following her arrival in Manila, "Europa" her squadron operated out of the port city during the French Revolutionary Wars and the concurrent Anglo-Spanish War. In April 1797 the ships of the squadron were badly damaged by a typhoon, forcing the Spanish to dock and de-mast the ships for extensive repairs at Cavite. A British force under the command of Edward Cooke raided Manila in January 1798, and found "Europa" to be one of the Spanish ships undergoing repairs there.
In January 1799 "Europa", "Montañes", and two Spanish frigates departed Manila under the command of Ignacio Maria de Álava y Sáenz de Navarrete. de Navarrete sailed the fleet to Southern China, where he intended to intercept Britain's annual – and extremely valuable – convoy of merchants returning to Europe from Canton. The Spanish ships arrived at the mouth of the Pearl River near Macau in late January, where they were joined by two french frigates. On 27 January the allied fleet fought an inconclusive engagement against a force of British warships sent to escort the convoy. During the battle, the larger "Europa" attempted to pursue the lighter HMS "Intrepid", but damage to "Montañes" forced de Navarrete to break off his attack and order a withdraw to Manila. "Europa" and "Fama" were again sent to Macau in May 1799, but failed to intercept any British ships. 
After her return to Manila, "Europa" fell into disrepair and was no longer fit for service. By 1801, she was reportedly a rotting wreck in Manila harbor.

Michelle Johnson (athlete)

Michelle Johnson Skog (born April 12, 1974) is an American female former track and field hurdler who specialized in the 400-meter hurdles. She set personal records of 54.15 seconds for the 400 m hurldes in 1999 and 12.88 seconds for the 100-meter hurdles in 1998. She was a bronze medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games and represented her country at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics and 1998 Goodwill Games.
Career.
Born in Portland, Oregon, she took up track at the age of seven before moving into hurdling while at high school in Vacaville, California and Paradise Valley High School in Arizona. She attended the University of Arizona, earning a degree in family studies, and competed athletically for the Arizona Wildcats. She was a finalist in the 100 m hurdles in the 1993 Pac-10 Conference then again a finalist in the 400 m hurdles at the 1994 regionals. She reached national level thereafter, taking seventh in the 400 m hurdles at the 1995 NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships, as well as being a hurdles semi-finalist. In her last year she was again a finalist and semi-finalist at the 1996 NCAA Outdoor Championships, as well as being a 55-meter hurdles finalist at the NCAA Indoors. At Pac-10 level, she was 400 m hurdles champion and runner-up over 100 m hurdles.
Johnson began competing at senior national events from 1995, focusing mostly on 400 m hurdles after graduation. She was eighth at the 1995 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, a semi-finalist at both distances at the 1996 United States Olympic Trials (track and field), sixth in 400 m hurdles at the 1997 event, before finally reaching the podium in second at the 1998 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships behind Kim Batten.
The 1998 season proved to be a breakthrough for Johnson. She set a lifetime best of 12.88 seconds in the 100 m hurdles and also dipped under 55 seconds for the 400 m hurdles for the first time. Her international senior debut followed at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she narrowly missed out on a medal in fourth place behind Batten. (She had also been fourth at the 1997 Summer Universiade as a collegiate athlete).
The pinnacle of her career came in 1999. A runner-up finish to Sandra Glover at the 1999 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships brought her selection for the national team. She ran a personal record of 54.22 seconds to take the bronze at the Pan American Games (behind Daimí Pernía of Cuba and Andrea Blackett of Barbados). Shortly before the World Championships she ran a lifetime best of 54.15 seconds at the Weltklasse Zürich. This time ultimately ranked her tenth in the world for that season. She came close to that mark in the final at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics, finishing in sixth place.
Johnson's career ended shortly after: she failed to make it into the top three at the 2000 United States Olympic Trials and the 2001 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and ceased to compete at a high level thereafter.

Cheyenne Flour Milling Company

The Cheyenne Flour Milling Company, also known as the Standard Oil Company and Salt Creek Freightways, is an early warehouse building in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The structure was built in 1927 to house goods brought to and from Cheyenne by the Union Pacific Railroad in an industrial section of Cheyenne as a flour mill, replacing structures that had performed similar functions since 1915. By 1931 the building was shared by a warehouse for electrical parts for the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company, a potato chip factory and a chemical products company. In 1937-38 the Standard Oil Company started to use the warehouse for bulk petroleum products storage, continuing to 1963. From 1963 the building was used by Salt Creek Freightways, which had shared use from 1936. In 1973 it became a plumbing parts warehouse, and by 2003 was owned and used by a general contractor.
The oldest section of the L-shaped building is a one-story masonry building, by , with a flat roof. A brick two-story section dates to 1927 and measures by . This section has a stepped parapet. A cone-story concrete block addition was built in 1936, measuring about by . Another brick addition abuts the connector, and appears to have been built as an office. Some of the masonry exhibits fire damage, attributed to its time as a potato chip factory. The facades retain a number of painted signs for the businesses that operated there.
The complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Chyskillz

Chylow Parker (July 19, 1969 – February 13, 2018), known by the stage name Chyskillz, was an American record producer, beatmaker, DJ, hardcore rapper, and a member of multi-platinum hardcore rap group Onyx.
Chyskillz was discovered by the late great hip hop legend Jam Master Jay of Run-D.M.C. who signed Onyx on his label JMJ Records. Onyx's debut album "Bacdafucup", produced by Chyskillz, helped the group to become a nominee for "Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist" on American Music Awards and won "Best Rap Album" on Soul Train Music Awards.
During his career, Chylow Parker has worked with well-known artists such as Large Professor, Onyx, Run-D.M.C., Biohazard, Queen, Ice Cube, Shaquille O'Neal, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and many others. Many songs were re-mixed, re-mastered and re-released after 1997.
Five albums produced by Chyskillz, were certified as gold by the RIAA: Public Enemy "Greatest Misses", Onyx "Bacdafucup", Run-D.M.C. "Down With The King", Shaquille O'Neal "" and LL Cool J "Mr. Smith". Two of them were certified as platinum: Onyx "Bacdafucup" and LL Cool J "Mr. Smith".
Early life.
Chylow Parker was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York. At the age of 4 he and his family moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York. At the age of 10, Chyskillz and his family moved to Flushing, Queens. That's where he met Large Professor, Neek The Exotic and Mic Geronimo. Royal Flush used to live on the other side of the building he grew up in. 10-years-old, Chyskillz touched a pair of Technics turntables for the first time. At that moment he knew what he wanted to do with his life.
In the 80's Chyskillz and Large Professor were a members of b-boy crew "Stay Fresh Crew". Chylow could do "Flare (acrobatic move)", "Airflare" and "Headspin". Chylow was a good graffiti writer, bombing the "I.S. 237" (Rachel Carson Intermediate School 237) roofs, you could see his tags "CHY" on Main Street (Flushing, Queens). Chylow also was a good BMX biker, rocking "Miami hoppers" before anyone else on Colden Playground (Flushing, Queens).
Career.
Jam Master Jay.
Chyskillz started his music career deejaying for Large Professor, the founding member of Main Source. Chyskillz working on a recording studio as an engineer and producer on Neek The Exotic's project. One day he met Fredro Starr, who saw him playing deejaying. Fredro liked his beats, so he gave him his phone number. Onyx's manager, Jeff Harris, called him and invited him to Jam Master Jay's studio. When Chyskillz got with Jam Master Jay his first professional credit was the remix he did for Fam-Lee – "Runs in the Fam-Lee".
Onyx.
Queens, New York City M.C. Neek The Exotic introduced DJ Chyskillz to the group Onyx in 1991. In Brian Coleman's book "Check the Technique" Fredro described how Onyx met their new producer:"...We met Chyskillz on Jamaica Avenue one day. We was buying weed at the weed spot and Chy was chasing my truck down the street, yelling, 'I got beats!' His stuff back then was jazzy, on some Tribe Called Quest shit, but it was hot. I knew he could put beats together right away. We brought him into our zone and made him do some grimy shit."
When Chyskillz met Fredro and Sticky they were already signed to Def Jam. The group was called Onyx and consisted of Fredro Starr, Sticky Fingaz, Suave (a.k.a. Sonny Seeza) and Big DS. When Chyskillz first got with Onyx, they already have another producer, but their stuff was a little bit more commercial and friendly. Chyskillz let Fredro hear some beats and it started from there. Chyskillz began making beats for Onyx and the collaboration just worked. The first song that Chyskillz ever did for Onyx was "Nigga Bridges". He did one song for them and Russell Simmons heard it and give Onyx an EP deal for 6 songs. But they did 10 songs on a budget of 6 songs, so Russell Simmons give them an album deal.
Chyskillz and Jam Master Jay co-produced the hip-hop group Onyx's multi-platinum selling debut album called "Bacdafucup". The album is described as having a "tense, wired edge that amplifies the vividness of the threatening lyrics. Sonically, it has a hardcore East Coast/New York City cast, full of throbbing bass and screeching siren-like effects".
Chyskillz drew notice for his work on hit songs like "Throw Ya Gunz" and "Slam" by Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC. Onyx's hit song "Slam", which Chyskillz co-produced with Jam Master Jay, was included in music writer Bruce Pollock's "Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era". It also made the Billboard Hot 100.
Chyskillz left Onyx in the summer of 1993 cause "they don't need him like a producer record". So Chyskillz signed with Wasteland Records.
In May 2003 Chyskillz founded his own label "719 Music Inc.".
Musical style.
In an interview with NPR, hip hop artist and record producer Large Professor described working with Chyskillz on one of his first demos:
"...that's the style of production that we were doing at that time, where he would cut up "Synthetic Substitution" breakbeat on one tape. And you had the two and three tape decks, and he would put the tape in there. And then he would play that tape and overdub some bass lines."
Last Year.
In the last year of his life, Chyskillz actively traveled by plane, now and then visiting the cities of Dallas (Texas), Atlanta (Georgia), New York and Miramar (Florida). In all the cities he had friends and there he found new clients – rap artists, for whom he produced music. On the Facebook he uploaded videos he shot at the airport, marked "Where in the world is Chyskillz now" so that his friends would try to guess the city in which the producer is located, leaving comments under the post. And in the video he used to say: "It's about catch a flight, I'll might be in your city".
Death.
On July 5, 2017, Chyskillz was involved in a car accident and had surgery in October on his shoulder and was scheduled to possibly have back surgery soon. He was in a lot of pain and not working so much. He was in Queens, New York. On February 10, 2018 he was suffering a bad cold for two weeks and went to the hospital and they informed him that he had the flu, should never have gone to the studio and should have been resting. On February 12, Fredro and Sticky flew to New York. Fredro picked him up in Queens to go to the studio to do some remixing for the shows. Chyskillz was so pleased with this, he certainly agreed. After the session he came home late that evening around 2am. The next morning his family discovered him. Doctors say he suffered a heart attack. Next week he had to go to Miami, and then to Dallas for work. He just finished work on the project with De La Soul.

<doc id="56616593" url="?curid=56616593" title="Zambian cuisine">
Zambian cuisine

Zambian cuisine is largely based on "nshima", which is a food prepared from pounded white maize. "Nshima" is part of nearly every Zambian meal. In addition to "nshima", Zambian cuisine includes various types of stew, cooked vegetables and different types of beer. Dried fish and insects are also eaten.
About.
Food.
Zambia's staple food is maize. "Nshima" makes up the main component of Zambian meals and is made from pounded white maize. It is served with "relish", stew and vegetables and eaten by hand (preferably the right hand). "Nshima" is eaten during lunch and dinner. "Nshima" may be made at home, at food stalls and at restaurants. In traditional communities, the making of "nshima" is a long process, which includes drying the maize, sorting the kernels, pounding it and then finally cooking it.
The types of relish eaten with "nshima" can be very simple, such as "chibwabwa", or pumpkin leaves. Other names for the relish are "katapa, kalembula"and "tente". The relish made with green vegetables is generally known as "delele" or "thelele". A unique way to create relish relies on cooking with "chidulo" and "kutendela". "Chidulo" is used in dishes made with green, leafy vegetables and also for wild mushrooms. The "chidulo" is made of burnt, dry banana leaves, bean stalks or maize stalks and leaves. The ashes are then collected, added to water and strained. The resulting liquid tastes like vinegar. "Kutendela" is a prepared peanut powder made of pounded raw peanuts and is added to the chidulo sauce.
"Ifisashi" is another common food in Zambia. It is a type of stew, made with greens and peanuts and served with nshima. "Ifisashi" can be vegetarian or cooked meat can be added to the stew. "Samp" is also eaten in Zambia.
"Kapenta", a small sardine from Lake Tanganyika has been introduced in lakes in Zambia. The fish is caught and dried to be cooked later, or it can be cooked fresh. Gizzards are also a popular delicacy in Zambia.
Various insects are also eaten. These include stink bugs, and mopani worms.
Alcohol.
In Zambia, traditional beer is made from maize. Individual villages once brewed their own recipes and it was shared communally. Maize beer is also brewed commercially in Lusaka, with Chibuku and Shake-Shake being popular brands. Other types of beer that are popular include Mosi and Rhino. The first Zambian beer festival was held on September 25, 2009 at the Barclays Sports Complex in Lusaka.
History.
The use of maize in dishes such as "nsima" or "nshima" happened during the latter half of the 20th century.
The Bemba people, who live in what is now Zambia, traditionally ate what was available depending on weather patterns. Bemba meals included a type of thick porridge made of millet called "ubwali" which was eaten with "relish" called "umunani". "Ubwali" was eaten with nearly every meal. "Umunani" was most often a type of stew made with meat, fish, insects or vegetables. The Bemba preferred to eat "ubwali" with only one type of relish at a time. The stews made with meat and vegetables were cooked with salt and sometimes ground-nuts. Generally, the Bemba did not eat raw food. Overall, Bemba cooking was fairly plain in taste and only occasionally acidic or spicy. Beer was an imprortant part of social events for the Bemba people and beer was brewed often during harvest months.
Like the Bemba, the Chewa people also eat a porridge, called "nsima", which is eaten with vegetables and used as a scoop.
The Tonga people of the region have traditionally eaten insects which are cooked or dried.

Capo's bath house

Capo's Bath House was an iconic structure that appeared in many images of the Saint Augustine, Florida waterfront during 1870–1914. Capo's occupied an octagonal-shaped building located on a bay pier near 20 Bay Street across from Baya Lane throughout the Flagler Era. It appears in a sketch from 1875 that shows a wood building on a stone foundation across the street from the Old Spanish Prison and the residence of George H Emery.
The facility provided hot and cold sea water, sulfur water baths, and shower baths "in the season." Women and children bathed at separate times than men. Dressing rooms were provided to change from formal clothing to swim attire. In a 1934 interview with the "Saint Augustine Record", Ocean View Hotel proprietor Henry E Hernandez described the Bath House:
The proprietor was Philip V Capo (1844-1901), who was a Saint Augustine native descended from Minorcan colonists. He served in the Confederate Army and returned to city after the war. It was managed for many years by Adolphus N Pacetty (1829-1913), who was also a Minorcan descendant and a Confederate veteran. Pacetty was the nephew of Antonia Paula Bonelly, and the husband of Amelia Monson, whose brother was the proprietor of Monson House.
Capo's Bath House was destroyed in the 1914 fire that also ruined Genovar Opera House, Florida House, Hotel Clairmont, Monson House, and the Saint Johns County Court House.

Zakariya Maimalari

Zakariya Maimalari was a Nigerian army officer with the rank of brigadier-general, he was killed in the 1966 Nigerian coup d'état. He was commander of the 2nd Brigade, Apapa, Lagos in 1966.
Maimalari was born in the present day Yobe State, he was educated at Barewa College, Zaria. Maimalari and his childhood friend, Lawan Umar joined the Royal West Africa Frontier Force in 1950. As part of a Nigerianization program to enlist more Nigerians into the senior ranks of army, he underwent preparatory course at the Regular Officers Training School, Teshie Ghana and the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. Both Maimalari and Lawan attended Sandhusrt but Lawan was later discharged from the army. Maimalari was the first Nigerian regular combatant commissioned into the officer Corps of the Nigerian army. He was an instructor at the Nigerian Military Training College and later commander of the second battalion Nigerian army.
The intention to promote more Nigerian officers led to an organizational structure developed by regional and ethnic considerations. Maimalari was sometimes viewed by some Southern officers as a symbol of Northern domination due to his swift rise through the officer ranks from a regular combatant.
The day prior to 15 January 1966 coup, Maimalari was celebrating his recent marriage, unknowingly some of the attendees were also rebel leaders who would come back to haunt him. On the day of the coup, as soon as rebel soldiers entered his compound, he escaped through the back of his house, at first hiding in a small quarters in his compound before exiting into the main road. On the road, he flagged a car hoping to go to Ikeja, but unfortunately, the car was a rebel car and he was captured and later killed.

Church of Santa Maria Primerana

The Church of Santa Maria Primerana () is a Roman Catholic church located in the Tuscan town of Fiesole. It encloses the eastern end of Piazza Mino, next to the Praetorian Palace.
History.
First mentioned in AD 966, the church was built atop the stylobate of a Roman temple, from which a pietra serena pillar was incorporated into the church's north wall. There is also a Roman running north–south that flanks the church. Moreover, findings of nearby Lombard sepulchres indicates that the church was once an early Christian site. The church occupies a prominent position in Piazza Mino, near the Fiesole Cathedral. Due to an image inside of the Virgin Mary it appears that the church is the site of the oldest instance of veneration of the Madonna in the Diocese of Fiesole, which would form the basis for "Primerana" in the church's name. 
Santa Maria Primerana was expanded in the Middle Ages. From this period, the Gothic chancel remains. A new façade was built at the end of the 16th century in the Mannerist style. The interior was decorated with "sgraffito" decor by Ludovico Buti.
The portico, which is constituted by an architrave supported by columns of the Ionic order, dates to 1801.
The interior consists of a single transept room. The high altar was constructed between 1745 and 1767 by Bernardino Ciruini. On the altar is a 13th-century tablet by Maestro di Rovezzano, which depicts the Madonna and Child.
In the transept are two marble bas-reliefs by Francesco da Sangallo. One dates to 1542 and is a "Self-portrait of the artist"; the other dates to 1575 and is a "Portrait of Francesco del Fede". Also in the transept is a glazed terracotta from Andrea della Robbia's workshop depicting the "Crucifix between the Madonna, St. John, Mary Magdalene and Angels". There is, additionally, a large, painted, wooden crucifix designed in the Giotto school from the 14th-century, which is attributed to Bonaccorso di Cino.
The faded remains of frescoes on the walls are by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini.

<doc id="56616697" url="?curid=56616697" title="Welsh Streets, Liverpool">
Welsh Streets, Liverpool

The Welsh Streets are a group of late 19th century Victorian terraced streets in Toxteth, Liverpool, England. The houses were designed by Richard Owens and built by Welsh workers to house migrants from Wales seeking work; the streets were named after Welsh villages and landmarks.
The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr was born in Madryn Street, before moving at age 4. Although some houses were lost in World War II bombing and rebuilt, albeit in a different architectural style, many of the terraced properties in the original street configuration remain in the present day.
Following a period of decline in the late 20th century, plans were announced in the early 2000s as part of the Housing Market Renewal Initiative programme to demolish the estate and build new, but fewer, houses in their place. Despite the area being cleared of residents and houses prepared for demolition at a cost to Liverpool City Council of nearly £22 million, funding was withdrawn in 2011 following the change in government and the demolition did not take place.
Subsequent revised demolition and renewal proposals by the council and housing group Plus Dane were rejected by the government due to concerns about the negative impact they would have on the city's cultural heritage. Instead, a housing renewal company took ownership of some of the properties, initially in a pilot scheme, to extensively renovate them and make them available for rent. The first new tenants moved into Voelas Street around September 2017. Placefirst, the company renovating the properties, won an award in November 2018 for the standard of the refurbishments.
Geography.
The streets include Wynnstay Street, Voelas Street, Rhiwlas Street, Powis Street, Madryn Street, Kinmel Street, Gwydir Street, Pengwern Street and Treborth Street. Other streets in the vicinity, such as Vronhill Street and Pimhill Street were built on the west side of High Park Street as shown on maps from the early 20th century, although have since been lost through regeneration of newer housing. The moniker "Welsh Streets" is given as they were constructed by Welsh builders for Welsh migrants seeking work and housing in Liverpool and named after Welsh towns, valleys and villages. When constructed, the street widths were generous, allowing for trees to be planted in the early 20th century which were well-spaced and did not intrude upon the housing.
The streets are close to Liverpool City Centre and within 15 minutes' walking distance to Liverpool Cathedral, which is clearly visible throughout the area. Situated right next to the streets is Princes Park, designed and laid out by Joseph Paxton in 1840, an architect and later Member of Parliament for Coventry. Median house prices in the area are below the average prices for the wider Liverpool area and nearly 90% of properties fall within Council Tax Band A, the lowest band. The area falls within the Princes Park ward for local councillors.
History.
Early history.
By the 1830s, Welsh migrants were well established within Welsh firms in Liverpool. Maps from 1846 show that South Street, the road which runs along the end of each of the Welsh Streets, would have been a rear access lane. A map from 1846-1848, prior to the housing estate construction, shows an area clear of any significant dwellings, with a tanyard located in what would become Kelvin Grove.
By 1850, there were over 20,000 Welsh builders working in Liverpool who required housing. Land in Toxteth was leased for housing development, with the streets designed by Richard Owens and built by David Roberts, Son and Co. While working on the design of Mynydd Seion chapel, Abergele in 1867, Owens came into contact with Roberts' company, who were land surveyors and subsequently became dominant in Liverpool's housebuilding industry. Through his collaboration with David Roberts, Owens designed over 10,000 terraced houses in the city of Liverpool, particularly those in the surrounding Toxteth area where the Welsh Streets are located. In the latter part of the 19th century, just under a third of the city's population of 450,000 were Irishmen born in Ireland, just ahead of Welsh migrant numbers, of whom there were 80,000, who had been persuaded to migrate by the promise of work. Welsh migrants made significant contributions to the urban development of Victorian Liverpool.
Later history.
The terraced houses have outlasted many subsequent housing developments, such as towers and tenements. Some properties were lost during World War II bombing and were replaced during the 1950s and 1960s with housing typical of that period, but not in keeping with the original architecture. The streets with post-war houses were Kelvin Grove, Wynnstay Street and Madryn Street, with the replacement houses built detached from the original houses, thus reducing the number of properties in the available space compared to the original terraced arrangement. A map from the 1970s shows that partial demolition and redevelopment had already started on the opposite side of the Welsh Streets, specifically in Jolliffe Street and Foxhill Street, with those streets and others to the south having been entirely redeveloped by the end of the 1980s.
Around half of the houses originally constructed by Richard Owens around Liverpool had already been lost by the early 21st century, with the original clearance plans accounting for the loss of over 10% of the remaining houses. In 2006, the then Leader of the Opposition David Cameron visited the streets with Michael Heseltine and said he was baffled by the proposed clearance plans. The area went through a decline during the latter part of the 20th century, with half of Voelas Street being demolished and properties gradually becoming derelict as residents moved out. Most of the houses were still inhabited until early 2007.
Decline and Pathfinder renewal.
In the early 2000s, the Housing Market Renewal Initiative programme was launched, intended to renew housing stock across the country and raise house values in perceived areas of deprivation, with the Welsh Streets area incorporated into the renewal programme. A survey in 2003 found that 72% of respondents were at least satisfied with their home and over half were at least satisfied with the quality of housing in the area, whilst only 1% believed demolition would improve the area. The renewal programme's proposals were to demolish 500 Victorian terraced houses and replace with 370 new build houses, with a smaller scale refurbishment elsewhere. When the plans were submitted, over half of the properties were under social landlord control. The basis of the demolition plans was due to the location affording an attractive development site once cleared.
Council survey data published in 2005 showed the Welsh Streets were broadly popular with residents and in better than average condition, but the council nevertheless recommended demolition because of a perceived over-supply of obsolete terraced houses in Liverpool. When residents were consulted over the clearance plans in 2005, a 58% majority favoured retaining the houses over demolition. In Madryn Street alone, residents voted 33-1 against plans to demolish the houses. The land was offered to private developer Gleeson Group plc and social landlord Plus Dane, with proposals published for lower density houses. Some residents were happy to be offered new homes, while others were determined to stay, dividing the local community. Some residents who were keen on staying expressed concern that the planned new housing would cost around double (£120,000) what they were being offered for their home (£62,000), with mortgages unlikely to be offered to older residents. The Neighbourhood Renewal Assessment in 2005 stated that the environment around the Welsh Streets was bleak and that effective redevelopment following a clearance would significantly contribute towards regenerating the area. Much of a property's value came from investors who acquired the properties during Liverpool's European Capital of Culture period in the hope they could profit from reselling to the local authority. The majority of houses in the streets transferred ownership to the Housing Market Renewal Initiative, predominantly throughout 2005 to 2008.
By 2009, over 100 residents had been rehoused together into a neighbourhood nearby which they had helped to design, whilst others had left the area altogether. Homes acquired by the council were reduced in value by 20% each year to allow transfer to the council's preferred development partner for a nominal sum, whilst still being within the legal parameters for achieving fair market value. A three-storey townhouse in Kelvin Grove, acquired for £110,000 in 2011 had been reduced in value to just £1100 by 2015. Following the formation of the coalition government in 2010, schemes funded by the previous government were reviewed and ultimately funding for the pathfinder scheme was withdrawn with effect from 30 March 2011. The sudden withdrawal of funding left many schemes half-finished and some neighbourhoods only partially demolished, whilst others such as the Welsh Streets had not commenced demolition.
Opinions and renewal proposals.
Clearance proved contentious, with some taking the view that the houses were beyond rescue, while others believed them to be fundamentally sound. Campaigning charities led by Merseyside Civic Society and Save Britain's Heritage asserted that renovation would be preferable and cheaper. Although predominantly of Victorian architecture, some of the properties had been constructed during the 1950s and 1960s as post-war replacement houses and these were described in an Affordable Housing Program assessment as having "no value in the context of the 19th century terraced houses".
In 2011, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles quashed planning permission for demolition and required an Environmental Impact Assessment. New proposals for demolition of 250 houses were endorsed by Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson in 2012 and Housing Minister Grant Shapps, who visited the area to announce retention of 9 Madryn Street and 15 adjacent homes. Plans submitted in 2013 suggested that 150 houses could be built and 40 refurbished, including those around the house where Ringo Starr was born. The cost was estimated to be in the region of £15 million which would have seen the demolition of houses from the other surrounding Welsh Streets to be replaced with semi-detached properties. The managing director of the proposed regeneration, Claire Griffiths, suggested that 70% of residents had favoured the plans, yet housing charity Empty Homes disputed the credibility of the public opinion report, given the criteria used would have made it difficult to conclude refurbishment as a favourable option. Anderson wrote to Pickles in July 2013, confirming his support on the proposed redevelopment, suggesting the decision should be a local matter and believed the scale of the proposal was "not of national importance" and with "no design or heritage issues arising".
The plans ultimately fell through when in January 2015 following a public inquiry, Eric Pickles halted the demolition plans. Pickles agreed with the argument put forward by Save Britain's Heritage and the National Trust, specifically in relation to Madryn Street, in that demolition of much of the street, together with the wider Welsh Streets region would "significantly harm the ability to understand and appreciate this part of Liverpool's Beatles heritage", citing the potential impact for future tourism if the proposals had been accepted. Although the streets had not been designated as a heritage asset, Pickles disputed that the streets were of low significance and believed the proposals would be significantly harmful to cultural heritage and have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the nearby Princes Park, directly contradicting the view of an inspector.
Refurbishment.
With few alternative options, refurbishment was deemed viable by the council. A partnership was agreed with Placefirst, who had experience in renewing derelict properties. A pilot scheme in 2017 involved the refurbishment of houses in Voelas Street to demonstrate how the houses could be remodelled and to determine public opinion and uptake. Upon launching the scheme to prospective tenants, all properties were taken within the first weekend, with residents expected to move in around September 2017. The renovations involved remodelling some floorplans and knocking through to adjacent homes to create larger houses, whilst retaining some of the original houses in order to cater for various residential requirements.
Following the success of the pilot scheme, refurbishment of other Welsh Streets was approved, meaning that 300 homes would be refurbished or constructed. The council hoped that around 75% of existing housing stock could be retained, with over two thirds available to rent and around 10 percent available to purchase. Long-standing vacant land on Voelas Street, Wynnstay Street and South Street became occupied by 52 new-build properties, described by the contractor as a continuation of the refurbishment of existing properties with the same landscaped communal spaces to replace the traditional yards and alleys.
Aftermath.
The cost to the council to instigate and process the scheme was in the region of £21.7 million, of which the majority, nearly £20.9 million was required for the purchase of properties and the associated legal fees. The cost to make the properties secure was a little over £525,000 and just over £280,000 was spent to disconnect services.
In November 2018, contractor Placefirst won the Refurbishment Project of the Year Award 2018 and the 2018 Inside Housing Development Awards later that month, attended by more than 750 housing professionals. The following year in October 2019, the project was named as the top residential scheme at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Awards Grand Final. Tracey Hartley, chair of the judging panel, commented:
"The Welsh Streets is a fine example of how to breathe new life into tired, rundown terraced housing. Instead of bringing in the bulldozers, sacrificing the established street layout and embedded energy of the existing buildings, Placefirst has imaginatively refurbished the houses and surrounding areas to create desirable, modern homes in an attractive community setting."
Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick MP gave a speech in October 2019, committing to the redevelopment of Victorian-era properties over demolition, specifically referring to the Welsh Streets project as being part of "a new wave of regeneration and renewal". Jenrick suggested the programme of past governments to needlessly destroy pre-1919 terraced houses was ill-fated, suggesting focus should be on sustainability and protection of communities.
Notability and culture.
Ringo Starr birthplace.
Ringo Starr, drummer for The Beatles, was born in 9 Madryn Street, where he lived until the age of 4 before moving to nearby Admiral Grove. The threat to Starr's birthplace was announced in 2003, whilst a proposal was made in September 2005 to take down the house brick by brick and rebuild it as a centrepiece for the Museum of Liverpool Life, contradicting Liverpool Council's earlier claim the house had no historic value. Starr said it was not worth taking the house down simply to rebuild it elsewhere, as it would not then be his birthplace. Many suggested demolition of the area surrounding Starr's home was unsatisfactory, claiming "People liked the city's character, not packaged replicas".
The house forms part of Liverpool's "Magical Mystery Tour" and tourists would still visit even during the period of neglect and dereliction. Among the various owners of the house were The Beatles Story, who were the registered owners in October 2010.
By 2014, the value of the derelict house had fallen to just £525, having been valued around £60,000 just the year before. At one time, the house was owned by Merseytravel with frequent tourist groups visiting the property. Madryn Street remained derelict up to 2018 until refurbishment by Placefirst NorthWest as with the surrounding streets.
Peaky Blinders TV series.
One of the Welsh Streets, Powis Street, doubled as Watery Lane in 1920s Birmingham for the TV series "Peaky Blinders". All house exteriors were painted black to achieve the desired look and feel of the period. Filming on the street had to cease in 2017 due to refurbishment work commencing.

Sylvan Debating Club

The Sylvan Debating Club is a free speech society in which topical issues are discussed. Founded in London in 1868, it meets monthly and employs a traditional motion-based debating format.
History.
The Sylvan Debating Club was founded in 1868. More specifically, the inception of the club was discussed on top of one of the Green Atlas buses, which ran from the City of London through Baker Street and the Abbey Road to the Princess of Wales Hotel in St. John's Wood. A conversation took place between Alfred Harmsworth and one of the other founders and resulted in the first meeting being held on 6 January 1868.
The club, particularly in its early years, included a number of prominent members. This was partly driven by the Harmsworth family, who owned several leading newspapers. Ultimately three of Alfred Harmsworth's sons were raised to the peerage, all of whom became members of the club. Their associates and those of the other founders ensured that the club enjoyed the presence of illustrious members of British society well into the early decades of the twentieth century.
Operating in such a milieu meant that the activities of the Sylvans were reflected in major British newspaper reports at the time, particularly in coverage of the club's annual dinner, which was something of a set-piece event. In 1901, the Duke of Norfolk was the principal guest. In 1906, Charles Darling, a judge and future Privy Council member, was a guest. Lord Carson, a former cabinet member and leader of the opposition in the government of the United Kingdom, was the principal guest at the dinner in 1927.
Over the years the Sylvans discussed topics such as the probity of the British press, the clarity of language used in British legal courts, the past and future of the club itself, the relationship between members of Parliament and newspaper editors, the oratory style of the House of Commons, the merits of public schools, vegetarianism and whether bachelors should be taxed among many others.
While it is ironically debatable whether such clubs had any impact whatsoever on the course of history, there are some statements recorded in the newspaper reports providing relevant indications. During his speech at the 1901 Sylvan dinner, His Grace the Duke of Norfolk commented, according to the London Evening Standard, that "he thought that such clubs as the Sylvan Debating Club really did an important part in carrying on the public life of England, and the writing of the history of the great nation to which they belonged."
The club continued its activities through both the first and second World Wars, though the frequency of meetings reduced significantly, according to minute books recorded by the club's secretary. The customary schedule had been weekly debates October through to April, with breaks over Christmas and Easter, with a program of topics announced in advance via printed cards.
Membership in debating societies in London in general waxed and waned due to various factors, post an initial flourishing in the mid eighteenth century. By the mid twentieth century, few of these original clubs were still in existence. Those that were experienced a general decline in membership, in particular when major newspapers closed their Fleet Street offices. The Sylvans continued uninterrupted during this period, though membership declined to a low point in the early 2000s, which has since been reversed.
Current activities.
The subject of the club's now monthly debates typically relates to key topical issues of public and political life. Recent subjects have included Brexit, the NHS, the UK and US elections, the role of women in government, the war in Syria and many others.
The Sylvans debates are structured along the lines of the those held by the Oxford and Cambridge Unions and other debating societies. There is a chairman who introduces the speakers and controls the debate generally. The debate is focused on a particular motion. This is proposed by the Proposer and opposed by the Opposer, following which all present are invited to contribute if they so wish, which are called "floor speeches".
Following rebuttals by the Proposer and the Opposer, the debate concludes with a vote, and the motion is thus declared to be either won or lost. Members and guests are invited to play a role in selecting the motions, and to put themselves forward for the position of Proposer or Opposer.

Gorlice Ghetto

The Gorlice Ghetto was established in the year 1940 after German occupation of the Polish city began on September 7, 1939. As one of many ghettos created by Nazi Germany in the General Government, its establishment meant further persecution and violence against the nearly 3,400 Jewish citizens that were settled in the area. As German forces quickly seized hundreds of the young, able men of Gorlice in order to use them for forced labor, many Jews began hiding for their lives as their businesses were taken and the rapid spread of disease plagued the city. The ghetto was officially dissolved on September 14, 1942, and carried with its downfall the transportation of hundreds of Jews to the concentration camp located in Bełżec.
History.
In Gorlice, the German occupation of September 7, 1939 marked the beginnings of establishing a ghetto in the city, as the Wehrmacht began taking Jews from their homes, robbing them of earthly possessions, and forcing them into labor-intensive work. Jewish businesses were taken over and implemented into fabricated "trustee" groups by the Germans. Though some owners were granted access to keep their businesses running, many women ended up taking over the establishments, as the Jewish men went into hiding, attempting to escape from a life of forced labor by the Reich.
Population and consumption.
During the first year of occupation, the Jewish population of Gorlice actually increased, despite the increase of violence in the area and the initial move many residents took beginning at the outbreak of the war in Europe. Hundreds of refugees from Germany poured into the city following increases of violence instances within the country, most famously that of Kristallnacht. With this increase in community size, food shortages became a problem for families in the area. Soup kitchens, like those opened by Judenrat in 1940, were rare sources of nourishment for the thousands of refugees.
Smuggling food became a necessary part of survival for many Jews occupying Gorlice, many obtaining sustenance from the neighboring country of Slovakia, nearly nineteen miles away from the location of the ghetto. The ghetto itself was guarded by Ukrainian police officials and, though they were firm in serving the local Gestapo, some officers aided the Jews inside by helping them to smuggling food supplies like coffee, tea, and cocoa into Gorlice. This kind of desperation was indicative of the overarching Nazi motive behind ghettoization of so many parts of Europe, that being to drain all physical elements of worth from the Jewish people in hopes to drive them out of what was to become a greater German population. The hard conditions and starvation within the occupied areas was meant to force the Jews to sell all their earthly possessions in order to afford food and drink to survive. Soon, many families found themselves drained of all resources and food became a "luxury" of the "wealthy."
Conditions.
The ghettos in German occupied Poland in the early 1940s became overrun with sickness and fatal diseases. Due to lack of proper nutrition or resources, it became a common occurrence to have entire families ill to the point of no return with little means to cure their ailments. Until 1941, no Jewish doctors were given access to help patients leaving many dead from lack of proper healthcare. Late 1940 saw a small hospital open for affected Jews through funding from the Judenrat and Jewish doctors and physicians from the Kraków district from the JSS (Jewish Self Help) organization. Though this was all set up with good intention, little funding translated into gaining access to vital medicines, leaving many with a lack of aid. Notably, the Dr. Otstanki "put aside his antisemitic convictions" and attempted to attend to the sick of Gorlice, at great risk of being persecuted by Nazi SS forces. Other doctors, like Dr. Feldmaus arrived in 1941, and by fall there were two dental service posts opened within the ghetto.
Persecution in the ghetto.
German SS forces controlled nearly every aspect of life for the Jews within the Gorlice Ghetto, and instances of intense violence or discrimination were common within the area. Beatings of Jewish men, women, and children on public streets became part of living in the ghetto, and vicious kidnapping of Jewish men in hiding happened more often than not, leading to more Jews being forced into going to labor camps. As the Judenrat became a bigger source of aid to the Jews in Gorlice, they began to feed into Nazi opposition. Rumors in 1942 flew about that the ghetto would soon be liquidated, and in an effort to enforce their control over the Jewish citizens of the occupied territory, Nazi forces ordered all the men of the ghetto to the town square. They demanded for 250,000 złoty, an amount unpayable by the starving and poor living in Gorlice. Many hid from the SS forces in an effort to escape this persecution, and all who were found hiding were shot on site. Some Jews from the square were selected to go to the Płaszow concentration camp, were forced to undress, and were shot against open mass graves. Members of the Jewish Police and the Judenrat were lined against buildings with their families and, one by one, were murdered. Some laborers whose work proved "essential" to the German forces were kept alive, transported to paper factories, and were continuously forced to work. All other Jews who were no longer needed were taken to a shoe factory miles away, being starved of for the three day journey.

<doc id="56616804" url="?curid=56616804" title="SOBER1">
SOBER1

SOBER1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the biochemical reaction of deacetylation. The SOBER (Suppressor of AvrBsT-elicited resistance) 1 protein is conserved in plants and it suppresses the plant's ability to carry out the hypersensitive response against infection by certain pathogenic effector proteins from the YopJ family. SOBER1 belongs to the protein superfamily of α/β hydrolases and possesses a canonical serine/histidine/aspartate catalytic triad to carry out the deacetylation reaction. There have been contradicting reports about SOBER1's potential phospholipase activity, with one study claiming phospholipase A2 activity of the protein and another study being unable to reproduce this result.
Relationship to acyl-protein thioesterases.
Members of the SOBER1 family are considered closely related to acyl-protein thioesterases, judged by their protein structure. However, a change in their amino acid sequence renders SOBER1's biochemical properties into a deacetylase; in particular the hydrophobic tunnel, which is found in acyl-protein thioesterases, is impaired by additional amino acids in the lid structure of SOBER1, creating a new surface for binding of the acetyl group. 
Targets.
So far, the following proteins have been identified as SOBER1 targets: AvrBsT; ACIP1.

Gerberding Hall

Gerberding Hall (formerly known as the Administration Building) is a building on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, United States.
History.
The Administration Building was built in 1949 to house the University of Washington's administrative offices and was the first major structure erected on campus following World War II. Constructed from a design by Victor N. Jones and John T. Jacobsen, it was built at a cost of $1,561,924.
In 1995, the Administration Building was renamed Gerberding Hall in honor of former university president William Gerberding. As of 2017, the building houses the office of the university's president.
Design.
Located abutting Red Square, and constructed entirely of cast stone, Gerberding Hall is built in the collegiate Gothic style with its characteristic elements including gargoyles, pointed arches, towers, and gabled roofs. Along its parapets are 25 sculptures by Dudley Pratt representing different academic disciplines; for example, a figure of the god Neptune on the building's east gable is intended to represent oceanography and fisheries science. The structure is dominated by a central, square tower. On the face of each of its sides is engraved the keys of Phi Beta Kappa. The tower itself, originally intended to serve as a belfry, did not fulfill that purpose until 2008. In that year, a set of eight bells – the Gordon Stuart Peek Foundation Memorial Bells – was installed which were designed to be operated by change ringing. A shield bearing the visage of Herbert Condon in relief and the words "Friend of Youth" sits over the exterior doorway to the tower. 
Other sculptures on the building's exterior include a Siberian Husky and a man wearing academic gowns holding an adding machine and a money bag.
The interior consists of two, three-story wings set at different ground levels, hinged at the central tower.

Healthcare in Slovakia has features of the Bismarck, the Beveridge and the National Health Insurance systems. Compulsory healthcare contributions, which are income-related, are paid to the chosen health insurance company. 4% is paid by the employee and 10% by the employer. Self-employed people have to pay all 14%. The government pays in respect of those not working, at a rate of 4.9% of average income. More than 98% of the population is covered by health insurance. There are three health insurance companies, one owned by the government which insures 65% of the population. Entitlement to treatment is not affected by the level of contributions. The system does not cover plastic surgery or all dental treatment. What is covered by health insurance is specified in legislation. The full cost of medication is not always covered.
Medical procedures are assigned an artificial value in ‘points’ which is converted to real monetary value by the health insurance company. General practitioners get a capitation payment for each registered patient. There are reimbursement limits, and these can be exceeded in respect of individual patients by negotiation.
Public healthcare expenditure was about €3400 million in 2009, around 5.36% of the gross domestic product.
Slovaks rarely use private healthcare, but a health tourism industry is developing around the country's natural spas.
There are 44 state hospitals.
An eHealth system, administered by the National Healthcare Information Centre was launched in 2018. 92 hospitals were connected to the system. All outpatients’ departments are required to participate. Online medical records are now linked to ID cards. Medication can be prescribed on line and pharmacies can also access the records.

Zayd ibn Muhsin

Zayd ibn Muḥsin ibn Ḥusayn ibn Ḥasan ibn Abī Numayy () was Sharif and Emir of Mecca from 1631 to 1666 and the ancestor of the Dhawu Zayd clan.
Early life.
Zayd was born on Monday morning, 27 Sha‘ban 1016 AH (17 December 1607) near Bisha. He was the son of the Emir of Mecca Muhsin ibn Husayn and a slave woman named Quwwat al-Nufus. In 1628 he accompanied his father to Yemen after the latter was forced to surrender the Emirate to Ahmad ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Muhsin died in Sanaa in 1629. Zayd remained in Yemen until 1631, when he returned to Mecca to serve as co-Emir with Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Hasan.
Co-Emir of Mecca.
On Friday, 1 Safar 1041 AH (29 August 1631), Abd Allah ibn Hasan (Zayd's great-uncle) handed over power to his son Muhammad and summoned Zayd from Yemen to be co-ruler. Zayd arrived at Mecca and took up his office in the second half of Safar (September 1631). Abd Allah continued to be mentioned alongside Muhammad and Zayd in the "du‘a" until his death on Friday night, 10 Jumada II (1–2 January 1632).
In Jumada I or Jumada II, Dilawar Agha arrived by sea to replace Mustafa Bey as governor of Jeddah. He also brought royal decrees and "khil‘ahs" (robes of honor) for the new Emirs of Mecca. Muhammad and Zayd were each invested with two "khil‘ahs"—the first from the Sultan, and the second from the Vali of Egypt.
Deposed by Nami ibn Abd al-Muttalib.
In early Sha'ban 1041 (February–March 1632) news reached Mecca that an army of disaffected soldiers had left Yemen and was on its way to Mecca. After reaching Qunfudhah their commanders Kor Mahmud and Ali Bey sent word to Mecca that they wished to enter the holy city on their way to Egypt. Fearful of the disorder that the army would cause, Muhammad and Zayd denied them permission and despoiled the wells in the army's path. In retaliation the rebels allied with Nami ibn Abd al-Muttalib, a contender for the Emirate, and decided to enter the city by force. On Friday, 20 Sha'ban (12 March 1632), Muhammad and Zayd collected their forces and set out to intercept the advancing army. Mustafa Bey accompanied them with his own soldiers. They went to Birkat Majin, then to Qawz al-Makkasah, as they had received word that the army had reached al-Sa'diyah. At dawn on Wednesday, 25 Sha'ban (17 March 1632), the two sides met in battle near Wadi al-Biyar. After heavy fighting the Emirate's forces were defeated. Muhammad was killed along with several "ashraf" and two hundred of their army. The majority of the sanjak-bey's men were also killed. Zayd retreated with the surviving "ashraf" towards Wadi Marr al-Zahran while the rebels entered Mecca. Nami ibn Abd al-Muttalib was proclaimed Emir of Mecca, and he appointed his cousin Abd al-Aziz ibn Idris as his co-ruler.
Return to the Emirate.
After being deposed from the Emirate, Zayd went to Medina, and from there he and sent word of Mecca's capture to Halil Pasha, Vali of Egypt. In Shawwal 1041 the Vali dispatched 3500 soldiers to the Hejaz by land and sea. He sent ahead robes of investiture to Zayd with instructions to go to Yanbu to receive the army. On Tuesday, 4 Dhu al-Hijjah (22 June 1632), Nami and the rebels evacuated Mecca and barricaded themselves at the fortress of Turbah. Zayd and the Egyptian army entered Mecca without resistance at sunrise on 6 Dhu al-Hijjah (24 June 1632).
Siege of Turbah.
After performing the Hajj, Zayd and the sanjak-beys went Turbah, where they besieged the fortress for around twenty days. On Friday night, 11 Muharram 1042 AH (29 July 1632), they entered the fortress and killed most of the rebels inside. They captured Kor Mahmud, Nami, and his brother Sayyid, and returned them to Mecca, where they were executed.
Death.
Zayd reigned uninterrupted until his death on Tuesday, 3 Muharram 1077 AH (6 July 1666). He was buried in al-Ma'lah in the qubba of Abu Talib ibn Hasan ibn Abi Numayy. After his death the Emirate was contested between his son Sa'd and his cousin Hammud ibn Abd Allah.
Household.
Zayd had five sons:
Among his personal slaves there was Bilal Agha, an Abyssinian who held a high position in his court, and Dhu al-Fiqar, a Turkic mamluk who had been with him for many years and whom he made commander of his army.

Disappearance of Azory Gwanda

The disappearance of Azory Gwanda (born ca. 1975 – disappeared November 21, 2017) is about a Tanzanian journalist for Mwananchi Communications Ltd in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who mysteriously disappeared in late 2017 from his home near Kibiti, Rufiji District, Pwani Region, Tanzania.
Personal.
Azory Gwanda was 45 at the time of his disappearance. Gwanda had lived on a farm near Kibiti, Tanzania, with his wife Anna Pinoni. His mother, Eva Mpulumba from the Msimba Village in Kigoma Region, lived with the rest of his family, but has been the only relative to be interviewed regarding Gwanda's disappearance.
Career.
While working at Mwananchi Communication Ltd as a journalist, Gwanda wrote a series of articles on a string of murders of local government officials and police officers by unidentified assailants on motorcycles. Gwanda was the first journalist to extensively cover these attacks. He wrote for Mwananchi Communications and its publications "Mwananchi" and "The Citizen". He worked from the Kibiti Trading Centre, where he was last seen with unknown men.
Disappearance.
Gwanda has not been heard from since his disappearance in November 2017. He was last seen by his wife Ana Pinoni on their farm outside of Kibiti in a Toyota Land Cruiser with unknown men, claiming he was leaving on emergency business while also requesting that she hand over the keys to the house. After Gwanda's departure with the men, Pinoni returned to find the house ransacked, indicating it had been thoroughly searched. Previously, Gwanda had been approached by the strange men at his place of work. They had told him they wanted to speak with him and forced him into the car. Two hours later, Gwanda and the men arrived at his house in Kibiti. Initially, Gwanda's partner was not concerned about his sudden departure, but when he failed to return home or answer calls for two days she went to the local authorities. Mwananchi Communication Limited said it had no information as to where Gwanda had been taken, or why. Although there are small bits of information collected that illustrate the events leading up to the disappearance, no clear evidence has been gathered that may reveal where he is located.
Aftermath and reactions.
While little is known about Gwanda's captors, it is assumed that they were tied to the people responsible for the string of murders he was reporting on. This particular criminal case had been ongoing for two years with nearly forty other people being murdered before Gwanda's disappearance. Gwanda's extensive coverage of these attacks may have made him a target. Gwanda was a key asset in understanding the intentions and overall information regarding the murders and as a result of his disappearance, unreported information has been lost.
Gwanda's disappearance has concerned many organizations dedicated to promoting the rights of journalists around the world. Not even a month after the recorded incident, MISA Tanzania released a statement voicing their frustration with the lack of information surrounding Gwanda's condition, and calling attacks on journalists to be "...an attack on press freedom [that] must be condemned". Theophil Makunga, the chairman for the Tanzanian Editors Forum, asserted that "evil intentions" were present in the sudden disappearance of Gwanda. Mwigulu Nchemba, the Home Affairs minister in Tanzania, promised to speak with the heads of the police department about Gwanda. IFEX, another institution devoted to free expression, is concerned that Gwanda's disappearance "may discourage" the work of other journalists pursuing similar investigations. The news company that Gwanda had worked for, Mwananchi Communication Limited, also requested that these types of organizations, as well as the Tanzanian government, intensify the search for information.
In September 2018 Gwanda received the Daudi Mwangosi Award for courage in journalism from the Union of Tanzania Press Club.
In November 2018 two representatives of the Committee to Protect Journalists were detained in Tanzania while studying threats to journalists in the country, including Gwanda's disappearance.

Acton Works

Acton Works is a London Underground maintenance facility in West London, England. It is accessed from the District line and Piccadilly line tracks to the east of Acton Town station, and was opened in 1922. It was responsible for the overhaul of rolling stock, and gradually took on this role for more lines, until the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, when all major overhauls of underground vehicles were carried out at the works. By 1985, when rolling stock had become more reliable and maintenance intervals had increased, this function was devolved to depots on each line. Subsequently, Acton continued to overhaul major items after they had been removed from trains at the depots, and tendered for work, which included the conversion of the A60 Stock to One Person Operation. It is likely to be reorganised and expanded to house the departments displaced from Lillie Bridge Depot which is being demolished as part of the redevelopment of Earls Court Exhibition Centre.
The site housed the engineering design department for London Underground, and under the leadership of charismatic figures like William Sebastian Graff-Baker from 1922 until 1952 and Stan Driver in the 1960s, produced a series of elegant and innovative designs for batches of rolling stock. The department's nadir was the design of the 1983 Stock, which was produced without any input from an outside design agency. The stock was less than successful, and resulted in a decision that design agencies would always be involved in future rolling stock development.
Major rolling stock projects carried out at the works have included the refurbishment of 15 of the Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives in 1953, and the conversion of the experimental 1960 Stock for Automatic Train Operation trials on the Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line, in preparation for its use on the Victoria line. The works has also been the home of several works shunters. Two were made from redundant driving motor cars, cut in half and joined back to back. A third consisted of two cars of 1935 Stock, which had been converted at the works in 1969 for articulation trials, and acted as a shunter after the trials were completed. A fourth shunter was built by modifying two driving motor cars of 1938 Stock.
History.
Acton Works was conceived as a central overhaul workshop for the London Underground, and the first part of it was opened in 1922. It was designed to allow the overhaul of around 16 cars per week, and initially serviced cars from the District line, the Piccadilly line and the Bakerloo line. Motor cars entered the works for major overhaul every , or approximately once a year, while trailer cars were overhauled less frequently, after they had run around . Subsequently, the works was expanded, to enable it to cope with the overhaul of 60 cars per week. Rather than just the three lines, the cars came from all of the lines run by London Underground, although the Metropolitan line remained independent for longer than the rest. Facilities for the repair of bodywork and repainting were also added. The works did not overhaul cars from the Northern line until 1927, when a new underground junction was constructed at King's Cross to allow transfer of the vehicles, while transferring cars from the Bakerloo line involved a circuitous route via Willesden Junction and Earl's Court, until the line was extended to Stanmore in 1939. Maintenance of Metropolitan line trains moved from Neasden Depot to Acton Works in 1933, when the London Passenger Transport Board was formed.
Cars for overhaul would arrive at a small platform near the trimming shop, where the seats would be removed for refurbishment. At the lifting shop, the car body would be lifted off its original bogies, and mounted onto accommodation bogies, which provided much more clearance below the car, so that items below the car floor could be accessed more easily. A system of haulage chains, mounted in channels underneath the workshop floors, was used to move the car bodies through the various workshops. Dirt and accumulated debris was removed by high-pressure air jets, before insulation testing of the electrical circuits was carried out. A traverser moved the body to one road of the car body shop, where there were facilities for removing and maintaining reciprocating compressors, door engines and valves, brake valves, drawgear, electrical equipment and other items requiring servicing. Cars then moved to the paint shop, until the advent of unpainted aluminium bodywork.
In a separate workstream, the service bogies were stripped down into their component parts. Motors were taken to the motor shop, and when only the frames and wheelsets were left, ultrasonic testing of the axles was carried out. Badly worn types were removed, and new types fitted to the wheel centres. If the wear was less severe, the wheels were turned on a lathe to restore their profile. Once all the parts had been serviced, the bogies were reassembled on a conveyor, and stored until needed. The motor shop included facilities for complete reconditioning of traction motors, including rewinding armatures, and baking them at high temperatures to drive out all traces of moisture and harden the insulating varnish. Returning to the lifting shop, the motors were remounted in the bogies, and the car bodies were transferred back onto the service bogies, before final testing and the replacement of the seats. The works included a reconstruction shop, which was used for modernising old stock, or altering non-standard cars so that they more nearly matched a particular class of stock. There was also an experimental shop, which produced mock-ups of new designs, and a machine shop, where component parts for the repair or refurbishment of major items were made.
The requirements for major overhauls gradually reduced, as equipment became more reliable. The interval at which cars received a heavy overhaul increased from every four years to every nine. In 1947, the first underfloor wheel lathes were installed, which allowed wheel flanges to be machined without removing the bogies from the cars. In 1961, a lathe was installed at Northfields depot which could reprofile the whole wheel, without uncoupling individual cars, and this became standard practice. Improved insulation used in the manufacture of motors meant that armatures did not need to be rewound, while the use of aluminium body panels meant that the paint shop became redundant. By 1985, much of the equipment at Acton needed replacing, and London Underground took the decision to devolve the overhaul of cars to the depots on each line. The works was still responsible for the overhaul of some equipment, after it had been removed from cars at the depots.
Subsequently, Acton Works quoted for engineering projects, such as the conversion of the A60 Stock to One Person Operation. They won the contract, and most of the work was carried out at the works, although some was performed at Ruislip depot. Although much of the works was disused after 1985, a new Equipment Overhaul Workshop was created in 1989. The following year, a Depot Engineering Support Unit (DESU) opened at Ealing Common Depot, located on sidings at its eastern end, but this was short-lived, and the functions of the Support Unit were relocated back to Acton Works soon afterwards, with the building at Ealing Common being used to store items from the London Transport Museum's collection.
London Underground have been looking at options for Lillie Bridge Depot since 2010, as it is due to be redeveloped as part of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre site, and have decided that most of the workshops can be moved to Acton. Departments which will be affected by the move are Maintenance Infrastructure Services, the Track Manufacturing Division, the Track Delivery Unit, and Plant Services, which covers workshops and stores. It is likely that, as a result of the reconfiguration of the site to accommodate this, the Emergency Response Unit will be relocated away from Acton Works.
Personnel.
From its beginning, Acton Works had been the responsibility of William Sebastian Graff-Baker, who had been born in England in 1889 to American parents. After studying in England, he went to the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and Washington, D.C., and returned to England, where in 1909 he became a junior fitter for the Metropolitan District Railway, the forerunner of the District line. By 1913, he was in charge of all lifts and escalators for the underground network, and by 1921 had responsibility for all of the rolling stock depots. In 1922, he was appointed to the post of assistant mechanical engineer, and became the chief mechanical engineer in 1934. He had a great flair for design and invention, and led the team at Acton, who were responsible for train design, development and other experimental work.
In the 1930s, the designs for the Streamlined 1935 Stock emerged from Acton, and although the streamlining was less than successful, they were also responsible for the design of the 1938 Stock for which it was effectively a prototype. Next, they turned their attention to the sub-surface stock, producing elegant designs for what became the O, P and Q38 Stock. During the Second World War, many of the engineers at Acton were granted 'reserved occupation' status, which meant that they were not called up to serve in the armed forces. Graff-Baker, however, was seconded to the Ministry of Supply, becoming the Deputy Director General of Tank Production. With hostilities ended, he returned to Acton Works, and under his leadership, great designs continued to be produced.
London Transport had built numbers of Halifax bombers during the war, and so had gained experience with duraluminium panels. This was put to use in the design of the R Stock, built to replace trains with manually operated doors on the Circle and District lines. Early vehicles had steel bodywork, and were painted, but subsequent vehicles, known as R49 Stock, used aluminium alloy for the body panels and underframes. They were similar in appearance to the O and P Stock, produced prior to the war. For the sub-surface lines, the next design produced by the design team was the A60 Stock for the Metropolitan line. For the tube lines, Graff-Baker was keen to try out new ideas, particularly to improve visibility for standing passengers. A 1938 Stock driving motor car was remodelled at Acton in 1949, with windows and the glazing of the doors carried upwards into the roof. Prior to the re-equipping of the Piccadilly line, a full scale mockup of half of a car of 1952 Stock was produced at Acton, incorporating the new glazing and other features. Sadly, Graff-Baker died suddenly on the way to work in 1952, and most of his innovations were dropped. The design team pulled out the drawings for the 1938 Stock, and they formed the basic design for the experimental 1956 Stock and the subsequent production run of 1959 Stock. Glazing of the doors above the eaves would have to wait until the 1967 Stock was designed for the Victoria line.
By the mid-1960s, Acton's Rolling Stock Design Office had a new head, in Stan Driver, who had cultivated a good working relationship with Misha Black and James Williamns. They had created the Design Research Unit (DRU) in 1943, which had risen to become the largest multi-disciplinary design company in Britain. They worked on the concepts and general arrangements for the interior of the 1967 Stock, while Acton concentrated on the engineering aspects of the design. The result of this cooperation was another stylish design, which included windows extending up above the roof line in the doors. This concept had been championed by Alec Valentine, a member of the London Transport Board, when Graff-Baker had suggested it for the 1952 Stock, and now that he was Sir Alec Valentine and chairman of the Board, he made sure it happened. The 1973 Stock designed for the Piccadilly line at the time of the Heathrow extension, was another collaboration between the Acton team and the Design Research Unit, and the elegant lines and attention to detail of the finished trains was highly praised by Martin Pawley, the architectural commentator for the "Architects' Journal", in the April 1987 edition. The Design Research Unit had been excluded from working on the interior, which showed no fresh concepts, and the provision for luggage for travellers to the airport was poorly thought out.
Around 1970, the Northern line gained a reputation for poor service and reliability. This was partly due to the aged 1938 Stock then running on the line, but was exacerbated by strike action by maintenance staff at Acton Works, which resulted in there being a shortage of rotary air compressors to keep the trains running. In response to pressure from Horace Cutler, the chairman of the Greater London Council's Policy and Resource Committee, an order was placed for 1972 Stock, which was essentially the same as 1967 Stock, but with operating panels for guards fitted into one end of the driving motor cars. The lack of design meant that they were unsuitable for use on the Northern line on a number of counts, and the lack of a cab door for the driver caused particular problems. When new trains were required for the Jubilee line in the early 1980s, the team at Acton designed the 1983 Stock, without any involvement from a design agency. The result was lacklustre, and there were long-running reliability problems with the single-leaf doors and the bogies, which resulted in them lasting for only 15 years, before scrapping began. One result was that the London Transport Design Committee insisted that a design agency should be involved in all future plans for rolling stock. The Acton engineers worked with DCA Design Consultants from October 1982, on a small prototype run of trains for the upgrading of the Central line, and three trains of 1986 Stock were ordered. Many innovative features were tried out, and after extensive market research, the best features were incorporated into the 1992 Stock.
Rolling stock.
Between 1908 and 1910, the District Railway carried out a number of engineering projects, to improve the service which they provided. This enabled trains to run more frequently, and to meet the demand, three batches of stock were purchased. 32 motor cars and 20 trailers of C Stock were ordered in 1910 from Hurst Nelson of Motherwell, Scotland. The second batch was built in 1912 by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, and consisted of 22 motor cars and eight trailers, known as D Stock. The Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company built the E Stock, which comprised 26 motor cars and four trailers. Under the 1928 Reconstruction Programme, all of the trailer cars from the three batches were converted into motor cars at Acton Works.
From 1932, the line between Acton Town and was operated as a shuttle service, using a B Stock motor car which had been provided with a second cab at the trailing end. Under the 1935-1940 New Works Programme, it was intended to retain this vehicle, but as all other cars of B Stock were being scrapped, Acton Works converted two G Stock motor cars, built in 1923, for this duty. The work involved constructing a drivers cab at the trailing end, and fitting duplicate brake cylinders and triple valves. Controls for operation of the doors by air were added, and an interlock ensured that the driver was shut in the cab before traction control could be obtained. The conversion was completed at the works in 1939, and the cars operated for another 20 years until the service was withdrawn. After a while, the control circuits were modified, to limit the speed on the short curved branch, so that only the series notches on the controller could be used, rather than all of the series-parallel notches.
After a review of District line rolling stock was completed in 1926, purchasing of new stock began. In 1931 eight motor cars and 37 trailers were ordered from the Union Construction Company, which were known as L Stock. The motor cars were handed and faced west, but to make up the trains, six east-facing motor cars were required. Acton therefore took six motor cars of B Stock, altered the control connections and the air lines, and made other minor alterations to enable them to operate as east-facing cars. The L Stock was the first sub-surface stock to be delivered with roller bearings on the traction motors, and the previous batches of K Stock passed through Acton Works to have the white metal bearings replaced with roller bearings.
When planning for the O and P Stock, to replace older stock on the Metropolitan and District lines, consideration was given to a new type of control which Metrolpolitan Vickers were developing. The Metadyne system was therefore fitted to six old Metropolitan cars, dating from between 1904 and 1907. Acton converted the cars in pairs, one receiving the rotary transformer equipment and the other a motor-generator set to provide a low-voltage supply for control and lighting. Each metadyne machine could power four motors, and so each pair of cars had to work together, as each only contained two motors. After extensive trials, most of the O and P Stock was ordered with Metadyne control, and was the first use of regenerative braking on the Underground.
In 1921-23, the Metropolitan Railway had ordered 20 electric locomotives for the locomotive-hauled services which they ran on the northern reaches of the line. They were fitted with nameplates in 1926, but these were removed during the Second World War, and the locomotives were painted in battleship grey. By 1953, 15 of the locomotives were still operational, and Acton Works carried out major restoration work, including reinstating the maroon livery and the nameplates. In the early 1960s, they ceased to be used on passenger trains, when the A60 Stock multiple units replaced them, but four were retained for shunting duties, and No. 5 "John Hampden" was assigned to Acton Works, until it was scrapped in 1973.
Conversion of the prototype batch of 1960 Stock for Automatic Train Operation trials on the Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line, in preparation for its use on the Victoria line, took place at Acton from late 1963. Major work included sealing up the drivers cab doors, moving the door controls into the cabs, fitting a public address system, and changing the automatic couplers at the outer ends to mechanical ones. Trials of the converted trains began on 5 April 1964.
After major overhauls were devolved to line depots in 1985, Acton Works carried out most of the conversion of the Metropolitan A60 Stock for One Person Operation, although a small number of units were converted at Ruislip depot. Driving motor cars at the outer ends of units were fitted with missile-proof windscreens, door opening controls, and high-intensity headlights. The work took place between April 1985 and September 1986, with the changeover to One Person Operation occurring on the Metropolitan line on 29 September 1986. In order to combat problems of leaves on the line during the autumn, particularly on the northern reaches beyond Rickmansworth, trailer car 6036 was fitted with Sandite dispensers, to become a Rail Adhesion Car. Sandite is applied to the running rails, to improve adhesion, and the conversion work was performed at Acton in 1986. During the autumn months, the car is inserted into the middle of a four-car unit, to make a five-car unit.
A two-car unit of C69 Stock was damaged by a bomb at West Ham in 1976. Driving motor car 5585 could not be repaired and was scrapped, but trailer car 6585 was repaired at Acton, and ran with a motor car from a second batch of similar trains ordered in 1977. London Underground experimented with two all-over-advert trains, including a three-car C69 unit, which advertised Yellow Pages from 12 February 1998. The vinyl adverts were removed in May 1999, after which it was moved to Acton in August, where repainting in corporate livery was completed in November. Acton also carried out a trial refurbishment of a D78 Stock trailer car in 1999. This involved replacing all of the interior, and cutting windows in the ends of the car, to improve passenger security. Tip-up seats were provided at one end of the car, so that users in wheelchairs could be accommodated. Without end windows in the adjacent cars, the new windows would have been pointless, and so two further cars had them fitted, although the interiors were not upgraded. When completed, all three cars were in corporate livery, applied as a vinyl overlay.
Shunting locomotives.
Acton has had a number of shunting locomotives over the years. The first was L10, converted in 1930 from the driving ends of two gate stock motor cars displaced from the Hampstead line. The control equipment was left unaltered, but adjustable couplings were fitted at both ends. These could be moved up or down to allow the vehicle to couple to tube stock or sub-surface stock. The works can only be approached from one end, and the locomotive had a designated "Ealing" end, facing away from the works, and an "Acton" end, facing towards it. The coupling at the Ealing end was seldon used, and was gradually cannibalised to keep the Acton end operational. The locomotive was required to move individual cars around the works, and to make up trains once their overhaul had been completed. The original GE69 motors were subsequently replaced with more powerful GE212 types, and the vehicle was scrapped on 30 September 1978. In 1964, the works produced a second shunting locomotive of similar construction, using two 1931 Stock motor cars. The Ealing end retained its Ward coupler, while the Acton end was fitted with two Ward couplers, one at tube height and one at sub-surface height. The vehicle was fitted with sanding gear, to assist it when moving four-car units up the steep bank to Acton Town from the works, and equipment which had been mounted below the car floor was moved into the remains of the passenger space, where possible, to make maintenance easier. Numbered L11, it entered service in maroon livery on 19 November 1964, effectively replacing L10. It was repainted in yellow in 1983, and was preserved by Cravens Heritage Trains in 2004, when it was moved to Epping station by road.
On 15 May 1969, two redundant driving motor cars of 1935 Stock were moved from Ruislip depot to Acton Works, for articulation trials. The trailing ends were cut back, and the two cars were mounted on three new bogies. The unit was subjected to testing for a year from August 1970, and after the trials, was retained as a works shunter, because the shoegear spanned over , which meant that it could cross long gaps in the current rail at slow speeds. The cars were numbered L14A and L14B, and it remained in use until early 1975, when the outer bogies were removed for other purposes, and the rest was broken up at the works. The advantage of its length was realised, and a two-car shunting locomotive was constructed out of two redundant 1938 Stock driving motor cars in 1974. The cars were numbered L13A and L13B, and were fitted with reciprocating compressors, with power lines between the cars to maintain the advantage of the shoegear spanning long gaps.

2C2 3100

The 2C2 3100 were a class of electric locomotives of the Chemins de fer du Midi, France. They were ordered in 1914 but, because of the First World War, deliveries did not begin until 1923. They were designed for alternating current at 12 kV, 16⅔ Hz but, before construction, they were re-designed for direct current at 1,500 V.
History.
These locomotives were ordered from Constructions Electriques de France (CEF), Tarbes in 1914 following the decision to electrify the Midi network at 12 kV 16⅔ Hz and to order six prototypes locomotives. Their delivery was delayed by the First World War and then by the government decision of 1920 to adopt 1,500 V direct current for new electrification schemes. It was not until 1923 that the first two prototypes began their tests. The original livery was blue.
Technical details.
The machines were initially designed with three Westinghouse motors arranged horizontally but were re-designed with 1,500 V Dick Kerr motors arranged vertically and, presumably, driving through bevel gears. It is unclear whether there were three or six 1,500 V motors. If there were only three, it is likely that they would have had double armatures to allow series-parallel operation.
Career.
They were the first French electric locomotives designed to reach, and even exceed, 120 km / h. For a time, they held the global blue ribbon for speed with an average of 108 km / h on the Bordeaux - Bayonne route. Later, with the increase in train weight, following the arrival of metal carriages, they were seen as underpowered and were replaced by the 2D2 locomotives of the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans (PO).
Scale models.
The 2C2 3100 was reproduced in HO scale by the British manufacturer DJH / Model Loco, as a kit (white metal and brass) to be assembled and painted.

Hailie Deegan

Hailie Rochelle Deegan (born July 18, 2001) is an American professional stock car racing driver. She competes full-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 1 Ford F-150 for David Gilliland Racing. Deegan is currently a Ford Racing Development driver and formerly a Toyota Racing Development driver.
Deegan grew up racing off-road and on dirt, but transitioned to competing on asphalt in 2016 to pursue a career in stock car racing. She began her career in NASCAR in 2018 in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West. She became the first female driver to have won races in the West Series, doing so in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. She is the daughter of Brian Deegan.
Off-road racing.
Deegan began riding dirt bikes at age seven, and started competing in short course off-road racing after being gifted a Trophy Kart for her eighth birthday. In 2009, she won in her first race in the SXS Stadium Series' Trophy Kart class. She also raced in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series (LOORRS) Junior 1 Karts' final two races at Primm Valley Motorsports Complex. In 2013, she became the first female driver to win a LOORRS championship when she won the Junior 2 Karts class. Deegan became the Modified Kart Regional Champion in 2015 and became the Modified Kart National Champion the following year. She was also named 2016 Lucas Oil Off Road Driver of the Year. She continued to race full-time in the Pro Lite division of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series in 2017.
Asphalt racing.
In 2016, Deegan began her transition to asphalt racing by driving legends cars for Rev Racing. In 2017, she made her asphalt late model debut with a pair of CARS Super Late Model Tour starts, first at Tri-County Motor Speedway, and later at Hickory Motor Speedway.
NASCAR.
Deegan was a NASCAR Drive for Diversity member in 2016, and she received the NASCAR Diversity Young Racer award the following year. In May 2017, Deegan was one of nine drivers named to the 2017 NASCAR Next class, in which she was both the youngest member and the only woman. She also became a member of Toyota's driver development program.
2018: K&amp;N Pro Series, first victory.
On January 3, 2018, Deegan was announced as a full-time driver in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West for Bill McAnally Racing (BMR), a team that had won the West Series championship each of the three previous seasons. It was announced that she would also run a part-time schedule for McAnally in the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East. Deegan was the only female driver who competed full-time in either 2018 K&amp;N Series. Deegan made her debut in the season-opening East Series race at New Smyrna Speedway on February 11, where she started ninth but retired on lap 19 due to mechanical problems. On March 15, Deegan made her West Series debut at Kern County Raceway Park, finishing seventh. Kevin Harvick, NASCAR's 2014 Sprint Cup Series champion (who finished fourth), battled for position with Deegan at the end of the race and was impressed with her performance, saying, "If I had to pick one person to say, 'Alright, that's the person [Kevin Harvick Incorporated] would want to represent and has the most potential,' it would probably be Hailie Deegan. She did really, really well." On May 15, Deegan was announced as a NASCAR Next class member for the second straight year as one of four drivers returning to the program from the previous season. Among those in the 2018–19 class, she was once again the only woman as well as the youngest member. She scored her first career top-five finish on May 19, finishing fourth at Orange Show Speedway.
At Sonoma, Deegan qualified third and received her high school diploma during driver introductions. She went on to finish seventh in the race, earning her sixth top-ten finish in six West Series races. In her next race at Roseburg, Deegan finished second behind her BMR teammate, Derek Kraus, setting a new mark for her best career finish in the series and tying Kenzie Ruston, Nicole Behar, and Julia Landauer (all of whom are also NASCAR Next alumni) for the record for best K&amp;N Pro Series finish by a woman.
At the Dirt Track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Deegan qualified on pole position for the Star Nursery 100, becoming the first woman in NASCAR history to win a pole at the K&amp;N level. Despite a shifter issue during the first half of the race, she led 13 laps and equalled her career best result of second in the event. On September 29, Deegan became the first woman to win at the K&amp;N Pro Series level, taking the victory at the NAPA Auto Parts Idaho 208 at Meridian Speedway in Idaho. Deegan passed her BMR teammate Cole Rouse on the final lap, which ended up being the only lap she led throughout the race. Her win was the second for a woman in a NASCAR touring series race, the first being Shawna Robinson's one win in the 1980s in the now-defunct NASCAR Dash Series. With a sixth-place finish two races later at the K&amp;N West season finale at Kern County, Deegan closed the year by clinching Rookie of the Year honors for the series.
2019: Return to K&amp;N competition, ARCA debut.
Deegan returned to BMR in 2019 for another full and partial schedule in the K&amp;N West and East Series respectively. At the East season-opening race at New Smyrna, qualifying was rained out, allowing Deegan to inherit pole position after setting the fastest practice time. Deegan led the first six laps but eventually retired from the race, finishing 16th after suffering a mechanical issue at New Smyrna for the second consecutive year. Prior to the 2019 season, the Dirt Track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway's race date was moved to serve as the season-opening race for the West Series. Deegan earned her second career K&amp;N Pro Series win in the event with another last-lap pass, this time on Sunrise Ford Racing's Jagger Jones.
On March 1, 2019, Deegan announced plans to compete in six races for Venturini Motorsports in the ARCA Menards Series. Deegan made her series debut at Toledo in Venturini's No. 55 Toyota Camry on May 19. She ranked 12th in both practice and qualifying, finishing 18th and last after being involved in a crash with Joe Graf Jr. At Colorado National Speedway, Deegan earned her third career K&amp;N West win, though some deemed the victory controversial as she spun out Kraus, her teammate, for the win on the final lap. Deegan took pole position at the following race in Sonoma, though she never led a lap in the race and finished eighth after late-race contact with teammate Lawless Alan.
In August, Deegan made her debut for the DGR-Crosley team at the second K&amp;N East race at Bristol. Despite having originally announced the race as part of her schedule with Venturini, she confirmed she would run the event for DGR in their No. 54 Toyota Camry. At the combined East and West Series race at Gateway later that month, Deegan struggled and only managed a ninth-place finish while also sparking an argument with series veteran Todd Souza. Deegan and Souza made contact late in the race, with Souza calling her driving "disrespectful."
Deegan scored her first ARCA top-five finish in October at Indianapolis Raceway Park. The following weekend, she had a strong performance at Roseville in K&amp;N West, setting the fastest time in both practice sessions, winning the pole, and finishing second in the race. Deegan ended the 2019 season with a fourth-place finish at ISM Raceway, clinching third in the final championship point standings.
2020: Move to Ford and DGR-Crosley, Truck debut.
Deegan switched from Toyota's development driver program to Ford's at the end of 2019, signing a full-time ARCA Menards Series contract with DGR-Crosley, which themselves had announced a move to Ford the previous week. She cited Toyota's lack of available teams relative to their number of drivers as the reason for the switch, explaining, "there's so many Toyota drivers and there's not many seats. I think we made the best decision for my career long-term." Deegan's father Brian stated that she would focus on ARCA in 2020 to prepare her for the higher levels of NASCAR.
At the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway, Deegan ran the fastest lap time in the opening practice session. Despite a mid-race incident with Chuck Hiers, she would go on to finish second in the race behind Michael Self, tying Robinson and Erin Crocker for best ARCA finish by a woman. She followed with three consecutive seventh-place finishes before finishing third at Lucas Oil Raceway, tying the series record for best finish by a woman on a short track. Deegan would not score another top-five finish until Lebanon I-44 Speedway, where she finished fifth after being involved in multiple incidents throughout the night, including spinning out on the last lap after contact with Ty Gibbs.
By mid-September, Deegan had expressed frustration with ARCA's limited practice and lack of live pit stops due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it "favors the drivers who have been there forever" and makes it more difficult to attract sponsorship. She also called the quality of the racing in ARCA "boring" due to the field being spread out, arguing, "I think [what] we've been lacking a lot in the ARCA Series [is] good racing." She tied her career-best ARCA finish with a second-place run at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack, the series' only dirt race of the season. At the conclusion of the season, Deegan finished third in the point standings and claimed the series' Rookie of the Year award.
On October 7, 2020, DGR-Crosley announced that Deegan would make her NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series debut in the team's No. 17 Ford at Kansas. She finished one lap down in 16th, the best result in Truck Series history for a woman in a series debut.
2021: Full-time in Truck Series.
On October 17, 2020, Ford Performance announced that Deegan was in line to drive full-time in the 2021 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for DGR-Crosley, which was renamed David Gilliland Racing in January. Deegan's truck number, No. 1, was revealed on January 18, 2021.
IMSA.
Deegan's move to Ford in 2020 included a foray into the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge with Multimatic Motorsports. She ran the 2020 series season-opener at Daytona with co-driver Chase Briscoe. Deegan and Briscoe finished 43rd out of 51 cars. The pair's No. 22 Ford GT4 ran as high as 15th but developed mechanical problems about three hours into the four-hour event. Deegan returned to the series at Laguna Seca, teaming in the No. 22 Ford with Sebastian Priaulx.
Driving style.
Known for her aggressive on-track moves, all three of Deegan's wins in the K&amp;N Pro Series West came after making contact with another car, while her last one saw her spin out her teammate entirely. "Racer"s Kelly Crandall wrote in 2019, "Deegan doesn't care what anyone on or off the track thinks, and she has repeatedly made it clear she's here to win races, will do so at any cost, and then climb out and tell you all about it. Deegan has embraced her reputation as an aggressive driver, attributing it to her family's roots in motocross.
At Roseville in 2018, one week after scoring her first career victory on a bump-and-run pass, Deegan was penalized one lap late in the race for contact with Trevor Huddleston. In 2019, driving in her ARCA debut at Toledo, Deegan finished last after contact with Joe Graf Jr. and declared she was "done playing nice." Deegan's rough driving in the K&amp;N West race at Gateway led to an argument with series veteran Todd Souza. Souza stated that her on-track behavior was "full-on disrespect" and was quoted as saying Deegan "drives like she's a spoiled rotten little baby."
In the 2020 season-opening ARCA race at Daytona, Deegan's aggressive bump drafting nearly spun teammate Tanner Gray into the tri-oval. Despite her spotter, Eric Holmes, encouraging her to relax the aggression, Deegan later sent Chuck Hiers into the wall coming off of turn 2, leading "Autoweek"s Matt Weaver to write, "Such drafting tactics are generally disapproved of at Daytona and Talladega, and that's something she will have to learn." Later that season at Lebanon I-44 Speedway, series officials gave Deegan a warning for her rough driving after she spun out two cars within the first 70 laps of the race. The second incident involved owner-driver Bret Holmes, who was spun as he and Deegan battled for the lead. Holmes said after the race, "Some drivers just don't understand what it's like to run your own team and have to pay for their own stuff, so they just...knock people out of the way every time they have to take the lead."
Personal life.
Deegan is the daughter of Brian Deegan, a motocross rider, off-road racer, and former X Games athlete. Her younger brothers Haiden and Hudson have also competed in motocross. She attended Rancho Christian High School in her hometown of Temecula, California. Deegan currently splits time between her two residences in California and Mooresville, North Carolina.
Politics.
At the 2020 Daytona 500, Deegan expressed interest in meeting President Donald Trump, tweeting the morning of the race, "Today's goal. Get my helmet signed by Trump." Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also attended the race and connected Deegan with President Trump, leading him to sign Deegan's helmet and pose for pictures with her.
Controversies.
In September 2020, Deegan was criticized when comments surfaced from an audio podcast in which she called the COVID-19 pandemic a "hoax." On January 10, 2021, she again attracted criticism for using an ableist slur during an "iRacing" livestream on her Twitch channel. Deegan subsequently apologized after video of the incident was posted to social media. The next day, NASCAR announced that Deegan would be required to take sensitivity training prior to the start of the 2021 season.
Philanthropy.
For Thanksgiving in 2020, Deegan partnered with Ford to deliver 3,325 pounds of turkey to families in Detroit. The amount of weight was the maximum payload rating of the new 2021 Ford F-150. During the Christmas holiday season the following month, Deegan partnered with fellow Ford driver Joey Logano to deliver hams and facemasks to North Carolina-based foundations.

Upsilon Phi Sigma, () abbreviated as UPS, is a Philippine Inter-University and Collegiate Fraternity and Sorority established in the University of the Philippines Los Baños on February 14, 1935. It is one of the oldest known fraternal organizations in the Philippines. As of 2020, the organization is composed of 230 chapters in 16 local councils and 8 international councils.
History.
Upsilon Phi Sigma was formally organized by 7 University of the Philippines students from the different colleges of their university on February 14, 1935. On May 14, the original members composed their organization's constitution and by-laws. The newly organized fraternity attracted members from nearby areas such as Metro Manila while extending their membership through acceptance of female members, forming their sorority counterpart. During World War II, the organization has undergone exodus as a consequence of Japanese control over the University of the Philippines. Most of the student members relocated to the southern islands of the country, specifically Visayas and Mindanao, as the war continued.
In the 1980s, the organization founded a chapter in Silliman University in Negros Oriental.
Alumni Association.
The National Executive Council (NEC) and Upsilon Phi Sigma Alumni Association (UPSAA) are two of the fraternity/sorority's alumni organization.

Natural Resource Governance Institute

The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) is an independent nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving countries' governance over their natural resources (in particular oil, gas and minerals) to promote sustainable and inclusive development. The headquarters of NRGI are based in New York.
History.
The Natural Resource Governance Institute was established through the merger of the Revenue Watch Institute and the Natural Resource Charter in 2013. Originally based in New York, NRGI has opened offices in London, Accra, Lima, Washington, D.C., Jakarta and Dar Es Salaam. This partly reflects its focus on Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Mexico, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nigeria, Tanzania and Tunisia as "priority countries".
Organisation and Activities.
The Natural Resource Governance Institute is led by president and CEO Suneeta Kaimal. Its activities are supervised by a board of directors, with Smita Singh as interim chair. Finally, NRGI's leadership team and its board of directors are supported by an Advisory Council co-chaired by Michael Spence and Joseph Bell. Other prominent figures affiliated with NRGI include Paul Collier, Ernest Aryeetey, Elena Panfilova, Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, Peter Eigen, Daniel Kaufmann, Antonio La Viña, Ilgar Mammadov, José Antonio Ocampo, Anya Schiffrin, Andrés Velasco, Tony Venables and Ernesto Zedillo.
In line with its mission, NRGI supports civil society organisations, government institutions, private sector enterprises, and the media with technical advice, advocacy, applied research, policy analysis, and capacity development with regard to natural resource governance. Key tools developed in that context include for example the Resource Governance Index, a repository of resource contracts, and the Natural Resource Charter Benchmarking Framework. Notably, research and resources from NRGI have been featured by international media such as "The Atlantic", "Financial Times" and "Forbes", as well as national media in the concerned countries.
The Natural Resource Charter.
The Natural Resource Charter is a document aimed at providing advice and policy options with regard to the management of resource wealth in order to help resource-rich countries use their natural resources for sustainable development. NRGI promotes the implementation of the Natural Resource Charter and provides policy advice with regard to this implementation process. The Natural Resource Charter consists of the following 12 "Precepts", which are organised into three parts based on the chain of decisions involved in natural resource management:
Resource Governance Index.
The Resource Governance Index, developed by NRGI, measures the quality of countries' resource governance and ranks them accordingly. The index is constructed by sending a 149-item questionnaire to 150 experts in 81 countries, who research the issues raised in the questionnaire, compile documentation and complete the questionnaire. The quality of the survey data is then assessed by NRGI and enriched by further data on countries "enabling environments". Finally, NRGI calculates the index as a composite score out of the:
with higher scores indicating a better resource governance process.

Orpheum Theater (Galesburg)

The Orpheum Theatre, originally opened in August 1916, stands on Kellogg Street in downtown Galesburg, Illinois. The Orpheum's elegance and long history made the theatre a landmark in Galesburg which boasts other landmarks such as Carl Sandburg's Birthplace, the Galesburg Railroad Museum, and Knox College, which hosted an Abraham Lincoln-Stephen Douglas debate.
Building the Theatre.
The Galesburg Orpheum was built in 1916. In 1915, owner William J. Olson signed a contract with Harvey A. Craig to lease the Orpheum and provide its management, upon the completion of the theatre. At the time, Olson also owned the Gaiety Theatre on the corner of Cherry and Simmons Street. Olson wanted the Orpheum to outclass its competitors, attracting the most popular acts and fashionable audiences. In order to accomplish this purpose, Craig and Olson toured the Midwest viewing other theaters.
C.W. and George L. Rapp of Chicago were hired to build the Orpheum. Rapp and Rapp owned one of the largest architectural firms in the United States, specializing in building theaters: Chicago, Pittsburgh, Manhattan, and New Jersey. The Rapps believed that “showplaces should have all the trappings of the rich, but be accessible to all.”
Early in 1915, Craig and Olson took sub-bids for work on the Orpheum. Delays in the bidding process occurred because Rapp and Rapp failed to send duplicate copies of the building plans to sub-contractors. Finally, in August 1915, all the sub-bids had been submitted, and contracts were awarded. The design of the Orpheum was a blend of “Italian Renaissance and Second Empire Style of the 19th Century France with flourishes of classical, baroque, and art nouveau.” The lobby boasted a crystal chandelier and French-mirror windows. Iconic columns and French windows done by an Italian craftsman, added to the Orpheum's elegance.
The theatre's main floor seated 550 patrons, the balcony 500, and 15 boxes on the mezzanine level. The seats and carpet were old rose with trimmings in ivory. The Orpheum was built to be fire resistant, including fireproof curtains and chairs. The theatre was considered modern in its acoustics, stage construction, ventilation system, and dressing rooms equipped with running water.
Several delays occurred in the building process. Project manager Henry Duvall took sick, Mandel Brothers had to touch-up the decoration, the insurance inspector was delayed in publishing a rate, a contractor was postponed in laying cement, no temporary heat was available for the theatre, and a hundred chairs from the American Seating Company were damaged in transport. Although originally planned to open April 3, delays pushed the theatre opening into August.
Early History.
On August 21, 1916, the theatre opened in “a blaze of glory.” Tickets sold out early and some 1,300 theatergoers attended. The first program consisted of five vaudeville acts, two reels of motion pictures, preceded by introductory speeches by William J. Olson and Illinois Supreme Court Justice C.C. Craig. One opening night patron called the Orpheum “the finest house of its size in the whole United States."
During its early history, the Orpheum primarily featured vaudeville, the most popular form of theater entertainment throughout the early 20th century, “a series of short variety acts" with actors, dancers, jugglers, musicians, and magicians. As in the circus, these performers traveled from city to city on the Orpheum circuit. Galesburg's Orpheum Theatre operated on the Orpheum Circuit, and hosted many famous vaudeville stars during its heyday—Houdini, George Burns, Jack Benny, Al Jolson, and the Marx brothers.
Vaudeville reached the height of its popularity in 1928 when there were more than 1000 vaudeville theaters in the United States. By this time, short films had become part of the vaudeville programs, and were slowly gaining popularity. Vaudeville declined during the 1930s with the growth of both radio and the movies. Cinemas were cheaper than vaudeville, because live performances were more expensive to produce. The Orpheum Theatre like other vaudeville theaters declined and was sold to the Great States Theaters in 1935. 1 In order to become a cinema, the theatre underwent renovations: the French windows and bass work were removed, box seats in the mezzanine replaced, and the crystal chandelier was replaced.
In 1940, the theatre hosted the premiere of “Those Were the Days (at Good Old Siwash),” a film based on a series of popular short stories by George Helgesen Fitch. Fitch had written the stories, originally published in the Saturday Evening Post, about a fictional college based on the real-life Knox College. The film was largely shot on location in Galesburg, and featured some three hundred Knox students as extras along with William Holden, Ezra Stone, and Judy Barrett.
The Orpheum continued showing films through the 1980s. In 1974, Kerasotes Theaters leased the Orpheum from the Great States Theater of Chicago, and in 1978, bought the building. Under Kerasotes management the Orpheum showed first-run films.
On November 18, 1982 the Orpheum Theatre closed: due to the rise of malls containing cinemas with multiple screens, the inability to screen more than one film at a time, and limited parking space. The Orpheum was expensive: new paint, carpets, and an air conditioner cost Kerasotes Theaters over $70,000. After Kerasotes closed the Orpheum, the theatre stood empty.
Modern History.
In August 1983, the Knox County Board voted to form a Civic Center Committee to raise funds for the restoration and remodeling of the theatre. In December of the following year, Kerasotes Theaters deeded the Orpheum to the Committee. The transaction involved no money, but required the Orpheum not to show first-run films that might compete with Kerasotes business. The Players presented their money to the Orpheum Theater Project Committee, which directed the details of the renovation. A portion of this money was used to determine whether the community could support the theatre. The Committee also investigated the cost of renovations, a study necessary before applying for state grants.
The Committee made efforts to raise money for the renovation locally, then applied to the state of Illinois in July 1984, for a $2 million grant from the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA). Governor James Thompson signed the bill for $19 million in bonds toward state projects. Then, the state legislature debated about giving money to the Orpheum. In February 1985, a grant was awarded to the Orpheum, but the project had to wait an additional eleven months before the funds became available.
Originally, the DCCA planned to sell bonds immediately, but delays abounded. Debt service on the Orpheum bonds was supposed to be paid from a tax on pari-mutual betting at the Illinois race tracks, but on August 1, 1984 the Arlington Park Race Track burned down, eliminating this source of revenue. The fire, a decline in statewide betting, and a tax break given to race track owners by Illinois Legislature, left the DCCA with insufficient security and forced it to pay higher interest on bonds sold before 1985. Afraid that its bond rating would be too low, the DCCA chose to wait until December 1985 to sell the bonds.
Once the bonds were sold, the Authority had to reach an agreement with the State for the funds. The original agreement entitled the Authority to receive all $2 million, but the state reworded the agreement to withhold $200,000. The Authority had orinigally planned to earn $100,000 from interest on the grant, but the Illinois Grant Recovery Act required the interest be returned to the state. At one point the Authority considered ligation to force the state to pay interest, but attorneys decided that a court battle could take years and would further delay the grant.
On April 11, 1986, a check for $1.8 million arrived in Galesburg. The agreement stated that the Authority would invest the money and on the completion of the renovation, the DCCA would either take the excess interest or pay the difference to equal the promised $2 million if the Authority earned less. Because of these delays, the Committee faced new problems: the boiler went out, a pipe in the theatre burst, its funds dwindled to $3,000, and the cost of construction increased five percent. Rolland Killian, the project architect, had originally expected to start work on the theatre seventeen months earlier. Because the cost of materials had risen, plans for the renovation were revised to accommodate higher prices and the missing $200,000. New plans called for a contingency fund in case something else went wrong, and budgeted for movie projection equipment and a $22,000 dollar grand piano.
As the project got underway a dispute arose between the Orpheum Theatre Management Committee and the Knox County Civic Center (KCCC). The Committee's job was to handle theatre operations, but they did so under the authority of the KCCC, with no power to make independent decisions. This restriction hindered the Committee's ability to book acts for the theatre. The Committee drew up a new constitution and by-laws enabling it to exercise greater power to make decisions. The KCCC attorney rewrote the Committee's constitution, which continued its subordination to the KCCC and required KCCC's approval for all expenses over $2,500. Finally, after negotiations, the KCCC and Committee agreed to work together on a new constitution.
As the plans for the renovations were finalized, a dispute broke out about the Critic's Square, a concession area. The KCCC planned for a concession area on the mezzanine level, as well as for a marquee and new doors. Because construction costs rose, the theatre had to scale back the renovations. A compromise dropped the marquee and doors but kept the Critic's Square.
Another difficulty was the location of the concession area on the mezzanine level, inaccessible to handicapped and arguably in violation of the Environmental Barriers Act of September 1985. The KCCC argued its plans for the concession fell under an earlier law. A state review decided the Environmental Barriers Act did, in fact, apply to the theatre: the Critic's Square must be handicapped accessible, thru an elevator or a lift. Instead, the KCCC scrapped plans for Critic's Square on the mezzanine level and placed it in the lobby.
With this dispute settled, renovations moved forward. In 1988, the Committee began to plan for opening night. The opening had been moved back several times, before the Committee decided on the weekend of May 6–8, 1988. The Committee selected the Henry Mancini Orchestra as the opening night performance along with other events including the showing of Around the World in 80 Days and a cocktail party. On May 5, 1988 theatre doors opened for the first time in over 5 years, the Henry Mancini Orchestra played to a sold-out crowd of 970. Mancini dubbed the theatre a “Little Jewel box.” Orpheum launched the Red Carpet series to bring world class acts into the theatre, but in the fall of 2009, the theatre was forced to cancel the series due to high production costs and low ticket sales. But the series was reinstated in 2010 and the Theatre and its Red Carpet Series continued to thrive.
Funding for the theatre was a major problem. In 2000, the City of Galesburg gave the Orpheum 2% of the city's Hotel and Motel tax funds, up to $100,000 per year. In 2006, the Orpheum was awarded 501(c)3 non-profit status. In 2009, the KCCC considered scaling back theatre operations because of the lack of money. Ticket sales were down, repairs were required, the boiler needed to be replaced, State funds for the theatre were slashed, and the city's Hotel and Motel tax was producing less revenue. According to a December 2010 article, the Orpheum was posting a $141,000+ profit and attendance exceeded its goal.
In 2016 the Orpheum celebrated 100 years. Today the theatre operates Youth Entertainment Series (YES) a free introduction to theater for area students. They also host plays, magicians, concerts, and shows from a variety of different performers.

Prince Street was an American cop drama that aired only two episodes in March 1997 on NBC before being cancelled.
The show premiered on a Thursday night, March 6, at 10pm ET (the time slot usually held at that time by "ER") and was going to air on Wednesday nights at 10pm ET in place of the NBC drama "Law &amp; Order" for a few weeks in March and April.
However, after the ratings for the show's second episode showed a very low audience, the show was quickly cancelled. "Law &amp; Order" returned to its regular Wednesday night time slot three weeks later.

Novelty Automation

Novelty Automation is an amusement arcade of satirical game machines in Holborn, London. The machines are constructed by cartoonist and engineer Tim Hunkin, often by hand, and the arcade includes an expressive photo booth, an interactive divorce and a "small hadron collider". The arcade also includes three of Hunkin's machines which were once on display at Cabaret Mechanical Theatre's Covent Garden exhibition: "The Frisker", "Test Your Nerve" and "The Chiropodist".
Opened in February 2015, Novelty Automation is Tim Hunkin’s second arcade, the first being The Under The Pier Show in Southwold where he first decided to ‘re-invent’ amusement arcadesand allowed a hobby to take over his life
Novelty Automation is Hunkin’s paean to the local history of popular entertainment in London, a place he has said he has an almost "missionary zeal" for. Hunkin has professed his sadness for the commercialisation of the city and he believes people appreciate Novelty Automation’s political incorrectness and it being an antidote to the corporatisation of fun.
Discussing the venue's "Housing Ladder" slot machine, in which a player walks the treadmill steps of a physical ladder in order to move an automated figure towards a model house, Hunkin has said "I don’t think political art has an enormous effect, but in the short term it is satisfying to reinforce people’s disrespect of the villains." Hunkin spoke more on the subject at a talk he gave at Novelty Automation in November 2016 arguing that reinforcing people’s disrespect for its targets is the primary purpose of satirical art, "but in the long term it can also contribute to change: there comes a point where the villains can no longer laugh it off".
Hunkin’s machines at Novelty Automation have a technological style that blends old school electromagnetic approaches to movement - motors, pulleys and gears – with some aspects of more modern technology, used for video, sound and programming. Hunkin believes he is exploring a "limitless territory" and that modern world is too focused on “amazing software and simple physical interfaces… very few machines are the other way round".

Anatomical terms of microanatomy

Anatomical terminology is used to describe microanatomical (or histological) structures. This helps describe precisely the structure, layout and position of an object, and minimises ambiguity. An internationally accepted lexicon is Terminologia Histologica.
Layout.
Epithelia and endothelia.
"Epithelial" cells line body surfaces, and are described according to their shape, with three principal shapes: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. 
"Endothelium" refers to cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, forming an interface between circulating blood or lymph in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall. It is a thin layer of simple, or single-layered, squamous cells called endothelial cells. Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular endothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as lymphatic endothelial cells.
Epithelium can be arranged in a single layer of cells described as "simple", or more than one layer, described as "stratified". By layer, epithelium is classed as either simple epithelium, only one cell thick (unilayered) or stratified epithelium as stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium that are two or more cells thick (multi-layered), and both types of layering can be made up of any of the cell shapes. However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as pseudostratified columnar epithelium.
Transitional epithelium has cells that can change from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium.
Mucosa.
A mucous membrane or mucosa is a membrane that lines various cavities in the body and covers the surface of internal organs. It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue. It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at various body openings such as the eyes, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lip, the urethral opening and the anus. Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid. The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated.
Submucosal and muscular layers.
The submucosa consists of a dense and irregular layer of connective tissue with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscular layer. It contains the submucous plexus, and enteric nervous plexus, situated on the inner surface of the muscular layer.
The muscular layer (also known as the "muscularis propria" ) consists of two layers of muscle, the inner and outer layer. The muscle of the inner layer is arranged in circular rings around the tract, whereas the muscle of the outer layer is arranged longitudinally. The stomach has an extra layer, an inner oblique muscular layer. Between the two muscle layers are the myenteric or Auerbach's plexus. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can of course be modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system.
The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch.
Position on the cell membrane.
The hollow inner part of a body organ (such as the gastrointestinal tract) or tube (such as an artery) is called the "lumen". The side of a cell facing the lumen is called the "" surface; the opposite side, facing away from the lumen is the "basolateral" surface, which faces instead towards the "interstitium", and away from the lumen.

George Rhodes (musician)

George Arthur Rhodes (October 10, 1918 – December 25, 1985) was an American arranger, conductor, music director, pianist, and composer. He is most known for being Sammy Davis Jr.'s long-time music director, arranger, and conductor. Rhodes made history as a black music director by being the first to work for a major network (at NBC in 1966 for "The Sammy Davis Jr. Show") and to work for a Las Vegas showroom (at the Tropicana Hotel in 1973). After being hired as a temporary pianist for Davis in 1955, Rhodes eventually became his principal arranger and conductor, working on his variety act, "The Sammy Davis Jr. Show", three of Davis' television specials, two musicals starring Davis, and three albums.
Biography.
Early life.
George Arthur Rhodes was born in Indiana on October 10, 1918 to Margaret and James Rhodes. However, he moved to Chicago, Illinois and it is often credited as his hometown.
Career.
Rhodes began his career in Chicago as a pianist for the blues singer Lil Green in 1944. He continued to play piano for other black artists, such as the jazz musicians Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, and Arnett Cobb. While playing in Cobb's band, Rhodes moved to New York, where he was a piano student at the Juilliard School. While in New York City in the 1950s, he started his work as an arranger for a string of record labels: Apollo Records (from 1950 to 1952), RCA Victor (1954 to 1955), and King Records (from 1955 to 1956). Rhodes also continued playing piano with jazz musicians such as Jonah Jones.
In 1955, Sammy Davis Jr., while in New York to star in the musical "Mr. Wonderful," hired Rhodes as pianist in the band of his variety act, the Will Mastin Trio, which was then led by Morty Stevens, an arranger, conductor and pianist, himself. As Stevens began gaining independent success as a composer, Rhodes took over more responsibility as bandleader, eventually replacing Stevens as principal arranger and conductor when he left the act to work for CBS. Rhodes would continue working for Davis for 30 years, until his death in 1985. In addition to their strong professional relationship, Rhodes also quickly became a good friend of Davis and they remained close for the rest of his life.
In the 1960s, Rhodes served as music director for many of Sammy Davis Jr.'s projects. In 1965, he returned to Broadway with Davis as conductor for the musical Golden Boy, for which Davis was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Rhodes became the first black music director to work for a major television network when he was conductor-arranger of "The Sammy Davis Jr. Show" for NBC in 1966. In the same year, he also was music director for "The Swinging World of Sammy Davis Jr.," a television variety special which was nominated for the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special.
Rhodes again broke barriers in 1973 by becoming the first black music director of a Las Vegas showroom when he was hired by the Tropicana Hotel. This was precipitated by Sammy Davis Jr. becoming a director of the hotel (the first black director of a Las Vegas casino), at which he would also be performing.
In 1978, Rhodes was set to conduct the orchestra during Davis' return to Broadway in the revival of "Stop the World - I Want to Get Off" as he had for "Golden Boy", but was dismissed during previews in San Diego. It was reported that the producers had agreed to Davis' request for Rhodes to conduct only to placate him, but did not think Rhodes would be up to the job and instead wanted to use Ian Fraser, the arranger and music supervisor of the original 1961 production. However, upon finding out, Davis refused to continue in the production until he was reinstated, saying later "I told them I couldn't perform. It's like losing my family." The production team were forced to re-sign Rhodes as conductor/music director for the three week Broadway run.
Personal life.
In 1958, Rhodes married Shirley Anne Vest, who became a manager for Sammy Davis Jr.. They remained married until his death in 1985, and she described him as "a good, kind, gentle man." The couple had five children: George Jr., Shirley, Andrea, Gregory, and Eygie (Andrea and Gregory were children off Doris Jean Randolph and George Rhodes).
He had a strong lifelong friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. who often referred to him as family. In response to his passing, Davis said "He was my brother on and off the stage, and no one can ever replace him in either area of my life."
Death.
At the age of 67 Rhodes died of a heart attack in his sleep at his Los Angeles home early in the morning of December 25, 1985. Shirley reported that he had not been ill, and that the doctor who pronounced him dead said he "had no pain."

Career.
David Jalbert placed first several times at the Canadian Music Competition during his youth (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996) but it was his 1st Prize at the 1997 OSM Competition that launched his career, leading to several tours with, among others, the Jeunesses Musicales du Canada and Debut Atlantic. He had other successes in competitions (CBC Young Performers Competition 1999, Dublin International Competition 2000, Canada Council for the Arts Sylva Gelber Prize in 2001), but successive engagements followed rapidly in recitals, chamber music and with major orchestras, particularly in Canada (Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, National Symphony of Ireland, Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre Métropolitain, Bielefelder Philharmoniker, Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, among others).

BOAC Flight 783

On 2 May 1953, BOAC Flight 783, a de Havilland Comet jetliner registered G-ALYV and operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation, broke up mid-air and crashed after encountering a severe squall, shortly after taking off from Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. All 43 passengers and crew on board were killed.
The crash was followed in less than a year by two more fatal accidents involving structural failure of Comet aircraft: BOAC Flight 781 and South African Airways Flight 201, after which the entire fleet was grounded until extensive redesign of the type was carried out, leading to the development of the Comet 2 version.
History of the flight.
Flight 783 had originated in Singapore and was a service to London. After a scheduled stopover at Calcutta's Dum Dum Airport (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport), the aircraft departed on 2 May at 16:29 local time (10:59 GMT) on its next segment to Delhi.
Six minutes after takeoff, while the jet was climbing to , radio contact with air traffic control was lost. At around the same time, witnesses on the ground near the village of Jagalgori, around north-west of Calcutta, observed the aircraft coming down in flames. Severe rain and thunderstorms were present in the area.
The wreckage of G-ALYV was later found strewn along a track, with the main parts still on fire. There were no survivors.
Victims.
The 43 people on board were 6 crew members and 37 passengers of British, American, Australian, Burmese and Filipino nationalities. Among the victims were Australian politician Trevor Oldham and his wife.
Investigation.
The subsequent investigation found that, after encountering a squall, the aircraft "suffered structural failure in the air which caused fire." The probable cause of the failure was reported as "overstressing which resulted from either: severe gusts encountered in the thundersquall, or overcontrolling or loss of control by the pilot when flying through the thunderstorm."
The investigators also recommended "to consider if any modification to the structure of the Comet is necessary."

Todo mal

Todo mal is a Mexican film written and directed by Issa López, and starring Osvaldo Benavides, Marcela Guirado, Martin Altomaro, Alfonso Dosal, and Sebastián Zurita. The film premiered on March 16, 2018 in Mexico.
Plot.
The film follows Fernando (Osvaldo Benavides), a young diplomat who has just achieved the most important achievement of his career: returning Montezuma's plume to Mexico. Fernando is also about to marry the love of his life. On the other hand, his two cousins, Matías (Alfonso Dosal) — a former pop star — and Dante (Martin Altomaro), a man trying to finish an infinite thesis that lives in the closet of his mother's house, are the complete opposite of our protagonist. Everything changes when Viviana (Marcela Guirado), Fernando's girlfriend, confesses through Whatsapp that she has cheated on him, a message that arrives at the least opportune moment. Fernando loses the control he has maintained all his life, stealing the plume and throwing himself in an insane mission for revenge, which could cost him his life, his poor cousins, and the chance to bring back the plume of Montezuma to a country that has been waiting 500 years for its return.

X González

X González (born Emma González; November 11, 1999) is an American activist and advocate for gun control. As a high school senior they survived the February 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, and in response co-founded the gun-control advocacy group Never Again MSD.
González gave a viral speech against gun violence, proclaiming "We call B.S." on the lack of action by politicians funded by the NRA. Subsequently, González continued to be an outspoken activist on gun control, making high-profile media appearances and helping organize the March for Our Lives. Speaking at the demonstration, González led a moment of silence for the victims of the massacre; they stood on stage for six minutes, which they observed was the length of the shooting spree itself.
González was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018."
Early life and education.
González was raised in Parkland, Florida; a suburb of the Miami metropolitan area. Their mother is a mathematics tutor and their father is a cybersecurity attorney who immigrated from Cuba to New York City in 1968. They have two older siblings.
González graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the spring of 2018. They served as the president of its gay–straight alliance. In high school, González was also the tracking team leader on Project Aquila, a mission to send a school-made weather balloon "to the edge of space"; the project was documented by fellow student David Hogg. They enjoy creative writing and astronomy but not mathematics.
On the day of the shooting, González was in the auditorium with dozens of other students when the fire alarm went off. They attempted to exit through the hallway, but was told to take cover and took refuge back in the auditorium, where they were held for two hours until police let students out.
As of 2018, González was currently studying at New College of Florida.
Advocacy.
"We Call B.S." speech at the Rally to Support Firearm Safety Legislation.
On February 17, 2018, González gave an 11-minute speech in front of the Broward County Courthouse at a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The speech was in reaction to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, three days previously, during which a gunman had killed 17 and severely injured many more.
In the speech they pledged to work with their peers to pressure lawmakers to change the law. "We are going to be the last mass shooting," González proclaimed. "That's going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook, and it's all going to be due to the tireless efforts of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most importantly the students." The speech notably featured a call and response: "We call B.S.," in response to gun laws, calling for advocacy and empowering young people to speak out against school shootings. The speech then went viral. According to "The Washington Post," González's speech became emblematic of the "new strain of furious advocacy" that sprang up immediately after the shooting.
In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, González said they felt their message would resonate through repetition. "I knew I would get my job done properly at that rally if I got people chanting something. And I thought 'We call B.S.' has four syllables, that's good, I'll use that. I didn't want to say the actual curse words... this message doesn't need to be thought of in a negative way at all."
A recording of González delivering a line in the speech was sampled as the intro for Madonna's "I Rise", released in May 2019.
Subsequent activism and media appearances.
They and other survivors spoke with Florida state legislators in Tallahassee on February 20, 2018. The students watched the legislature vote down debate on an existing gun control bill.
The students also spoke at an internationally televised town hall hosted by CNN on February 21, 2018. González and others criticized the National Rifle Association (NRA) as well as politicians who accept money from it, as being complicit in the shootings, and stated that "you're either funding the killers, or you're standing with the children."
At the town hall, González pressed an NRA representative to clarify their position on guns. "Dana Loesch, I want you to know that we will support your two children in the way that you will not," González said at the town hall. "The shooter at our school obtained weapons that he used on us legally. Do you believe that it should be harder to obtain the semi-automatic and... the modifications for these weapons to make them fully automatic like bump stocks?" Loesch answered González by arguing that mentally ill people shouldn't have access to weapons. González interjected and noted that they hadn't answered their question. "I think I'm gonna interrupt you real quick and remind you that the question is actually, do you believe it should be harder to obtain these semi-automatic weapons and modifications to make them fully automatic, such as bump stocks?"
Shortly after their viral speech and high-profile media appearances, González joined Twitter and acquired more than 1 million followers within a span of less than ten days.
González continued to speak out against gun violence. "Glamour Magazine" called González "the face of the #NeverAgain movement" and "a recognizable icon" while "The Washington Post" called their "La nueva cara of Florida Latinx" ("The new face of Florida Latinx") and drew comparisons to the revolutionary José Martí. NBC News called their "one of the most visible student activists to emerge from the shooting..." In a nationally televised interview on "60 Minutes", González described the idea of arming teachers in classrooms with guns as "stupid." In March 2018, González was on the cover of "Time magazine" along with fellow activists Jaclyn Corin, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and Alex Wind. That same month they were profiled by "France 24".
Speech at March for Our Lives.
González and other students, including fellow Parkland survivors Hogg, Kasky, and Sarah Chadwick, organized and participated in the nationwide March for Our Lives protest on March 24, 2018, with a focus on speakers and a march in Washington, DC. González spoke for six minutes, the length of time of the Parkland shooting, and paid tribute to the victims by mentioning each one by name and giving examples of things they would never again be able to do. They followed this by several minutes of silence. González was interviewed on MSNBC at the march, stating people needed to "empathize rather than feel apathy" and calling for young people to register to vote.
New laws.
In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, the law allocates around $400 million for implementation. Rick Scott signed the bill into law on March 9. The governor commented, "To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change."
Continuing advocacy.
In May 2018 González met with James Shaw Jr., a man who prevented further bloodshed at a mass shooting in a Waffle House restaurant by rushing the attacker and taking away his AR-15 rifle and saving more lives; both Shaw and González described each other as heroes.
Attacks and conspiracy theories.
González was attacked for their Fort Lauderdale speech by many from the political right wing of American politics and press. They have also faced derogatory comments made by internet trolls about their sexual orientation, short hair, and skin color. They were verbally attacked by Leslie Gibson, then the Republican candidate running unopposed for the Maine legislature and lifetime NRA member, who referred to them as a "skinhead lesbian", whereupon 28-year-old Eryn Gilchrist filed papers to run against him, thus providing an opponent; Republican former state Senator Thomas Martin, Jr., who said that Gibson's remarks did not represent the Maine Republican Party, and that he planned to contact the survivors to commend their courage, also filed to run for the seat. A few days later Gibson himself dropped out of the race.
González was the target of many right-wing conspiracy theories and hoaxes since the shooting. Conspiracy theorists have falsely accused the students, including González, of being crisis actors. Benjamin Kelly, an aide to Florida state Representative Shawn Harrison (R-63), was fired after making such accusations. Donald Trump Jr. faced criticism for appearing to support the crisis actor accusations. The conspiracy theories spread about González and other Parkland survivors were named PolitiFact's 2018 Lie of the Year.
Following their highly publicized speech at the March for Our Lives, pro-gun activists doctored fake photos and video showing González ripping up a copy of the United States Constitution, spreading them widely on internet forums and social media. Snopes.com observed that the video was in fact a digitally manipulated Teen Vogue video of them tearing up shooting range targets. Adam Baldwin defended spreading the fake video, saying it was "political satire."
Attacks by Steve King and response.
Republican congressman Steve King attacked González for wearing a Cuban flag patch on their jacket during their speech, saying in a post on Facebook, "This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don't speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense." The Cuban flag worn by González was adopted in 1902, fifty years before the communist take over, and has been used by anti-Castro Cuban exiles as a symbol of patriotism. One of the survivors of the Orlando nightclub shooting, Brandon Wolf, responded to King saying "When it was my community, where were you? When it was Sandy Hook? Columbine? Were you on the sideline mocking those communities too? Did you question someone identifying as a mother? Did you question whether people like me were crisis actors?" and "Emma stood for 6 mins and 20 seconds to honor the lives of 17 gone too soon. The least you could do is shut your privileged, ineffective trap for 6 seconds to hear someone else's perspective." In an interview with the "New Civil Rights Movement", Wolf also pointed out that King keeps a Confederate flag on his desk.
King's comments generated fierce condemnation from Wolf, González, and other members of Never Again MSD. In June 2018, as part of the March for Our Lives' "Road to Change" tour, gun control advocates and members of Never Again MSD arrived at King's office in Sioux City to protest against King. Protesters and gun control advocates berated King for his history of racially charged statements and attacks; González personally denounced King and accused him of racism. King largely ignored the protests.
Personal life.
González is bisexual, and uses they/them pronouns. According to "Vogue", their buzz cut is not a reaction to the school shooting, but rather to Florida's climate. "People asked me, 'Are you taking a feminist stand?' No, I wasn't. It's Florida. Hair is just an extra sweater I'm forced to wear," González recalled. "I even made a PowerPoint presentation to convince my parents to let me shave my head, and it worked."

Continental Oil Company (Cheyenne, Wyoming)

The Continental Oil Company building complex is a significant component of railroad-related economic activity in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Built beginning in 1905, the complex was used by the Continental Oil Company for bulk oil storage through much of the 20th century. The property was transferred to the Sioux Oil Company, which vacated the complex in 1990. In 2000 the property was occupied by a trailer sales business.
The three-building property is associated with a rail line that runs next to Reed Avenue on the west side of Cheyenne. Building 1 measures by . The building is built over a shallow basement, expressed on the facade with sandstone masonry. The east side is the most detailed elevation with a corbeled, dentiled cornice that extends around to the north side. A brick addition on the south side was used as an oil pump house. The west side features a wood loading dock. The interior is mostly open space with a small office area.
Building 2 is a by one-story brick garage. Building 3 is a 1956 metal building. The site originally had seven large oil tanks, which have been removed. Leakage from the tanks contaminated the site and has required extensive mitigation.
The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 13, 2003.

Salamandre Lake

The Salamandre Lake is a freshwater body of the municipality of Eeyou Istchee Baie-James (municipality), in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, at Quebec, in Canada. The northern part of the lake is crossed to the West by the Broadback River.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with an upstream navigable waterbody including the Broadback River and the Nipukatasi River.
The southern part of the Salamandre Lake hydrographic slope is accessible via a forest road (east–west) coming from the west and connecting the main road going north. The surface of Salamandre Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May; however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Geography.
The Salamandre Lake is part of a group of lakes in the same area, which are formed in length, more or less parallel to each other, on the east side of which Quénonisca Lake, the Rocher Lake crossed by the Nipukatasi River and Amisquioumisca Lake (east side). While on the west side, the major body of water is Evans Lake.
Salamander Lake has a length of , a width of , an altitude of and an area of . The Salamandre Lake is mainly fed by forest streams. The areas around the lake have a generally leveled topography.
The mouth of Salamandre Lake is located at:
The Salamandre River (length: 47.3) is the outlet of the Salamandre Lake, which flows into the South Bank of the Broadback River westerly across the Broadback River over to the east bank of Corbeau Bay, an extension of Evans Lake.
Geology.
The "Rocher-Salamandre intrusive suite" includes the Whitefish Intrusion (nAwf) which outcrops mainly between the Salamandre lakes and Rocher (NTS sheets 32K09 and 32K10), the Rock Intrusion (nAlrc) and another small peridotite intrusion of less than in diameter that cuts the paragneisses of the "Rock Complex" (nAroc) and the migmatitic gneisses of the "Bétulaie Complex" (nAbtu) in the area of Rocher Lake (NTS sheet 32K09).
This convert was originally described as the "Rock-Kenonisca Massif" by Franconi (1974) in his report on the mapping of the western half of the Frotet-Evans volcano-sedimentary band. It was renamed "Rocher-Salamander Intrusive Suite" by Brisson " et al. " (1998) when mapping the Lake Rocher area (NTS sheet 32K09). The addition of Whitefish Intrusion (nAwf) and Rock Intrusion (nAlrc) as lithodemes in the Intrusive Suite of Rocher-Salamandre is proposed following the fieldwork and compilation of Leclerc and Caron-Côté (2017).
Toponymy.
In the past, this body of water was designated "Big Whitefis Lake" or the French version "Lac Poisson Blanc".
The toponym "lac Salamandre" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, at the creation of this commission.

For All Mankind (TV series)

For All Mankind is an American science fiction drama streaming television series created and written by Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi and produced for Apple TV+. The series dramatizes an alternate history depicting "what would have happened if the global space race had never ended" after the Soviet Union succeeds in the first crewed Moon landing ahead of the United States. The series stars Joel Kinnaman in the lead role as fictional NASA astronaut Edward Baldwin, with Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel VanSanten, Jodi Balfour, and Wrenn Schmidt in other starring roles. The series features historical figures including Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, and U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
"For All Mankind" premiered on November 1, 2019, and was renewed by Apple TV+ in October 2019 for a second season, which premiered on February 19, 2021. The second season was critically acclaimed, and nominated for the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. In December 2020, ahead of the second-season premiere, the series was renewed for a third season. 
Premise.
In an alternate timeline, in 1969 a Soviet cosmonaut, Alexei Leonov, becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA, but also catalyzes an American effort to catch up. With the Soviet Union emphasizing diversity by including a woman in subsequent landings, the United States is forced to match pace, training women and minorities who were largely excluded from the initial decades of U.S. space exploration.
Ronald D. Moore explained how history had been different in the series: "Sergei Korolev, who was the father of the Soviet space program, in reality, he died during an operation in Moscow in the mid '60s. And after that point, their moon program really never pulled together... Our point of divergence was that Korolev lives, ... and he made their moon landing happen."

Austronomus, known as Australasian free-tailed bats, is a molossid genus of microchiropterans. The two recognised species are the white-striped "Austronomus australis", found in a wide distribution range across Australia, and the New Guinea species "Austronomus kuboriensis".
The genus name was first proposed by Tom Iredale and Ellis Troughton in 1934, but this lacked a formal description until Troughton included one in his "Furred animals of Australia" (1944). The type species of the genus is "Molossus australis" Gray, 1838. The Australasian populations have also been allied to "Tadarida", a genus of widely distributed freetail bats.

Sugarloaf Rock, Western Australia

Sugarloaf Rock, also known as Sugarloaf Rocks and Sugar Loaf Rock, is a large, natural granite island in the Indian Ocean just off the coast situated approximately south of Cape Naturaliste in the South West region of Western Australia.
It is separated from the mainland by a thin channel of treacherous water. The rock is one of the most photographed attractions and it has appeared on the cover of the Australian Geographic magazine.
The rock derives its name from the distinctive conical shape reminiscent of an old style sugarloaf. 
It is designated as a nature reserve and a nesting site for seabirds such as the red-tailed tropicbird.
The Cape to Cape track passes by the lookout to the rock.
Access to the rock was limited with no road down to the shore present until the mid-1930s; the site was not well known in 1932, with visitors having to "scramble through thickets and down the cliff" to access the coast. The first recorded drowning off the rock occurred in 1934 when a man was washed from it. A danger sign was erected near the site later the same year. Two more fishermen drowned when they were washed off the rock in 1940, with a third surviving by clinging to a ledge then raising the alarm.

Production.

On August 12, 2019, Apple released a first look trailer for the series. It was also revealed that the series will be titled "Morning Wars" in Australia, in order to distinguish the series from the Australian morning talk show of the same name. On August 19, 2019, Apple released a full trailer for the series.
Reception.
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 61% approval rating, based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 5.78/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, "The Morning Show" often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all." Audiences on Rotten Tomatoes however, by contrast, rated the first season of the series at 93%. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave a positive review and wrote: ""The Morning Show" doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the Showtime series "The Loudest Voice" or the Aaron Sorkin poetry of HBO's "The Newsroom". It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving "Sports Night" TV series from the late 1990s."

Durlacher House

The Durlacher House, or Durlacher Residence is a Queen Anne style house in Laramie, Wyoming. It was built between 1875 and1878 by Charles Klingerman. In 1878 it was purchased by German immigrants Simon and Hannah Durlacher. 
History.
Simon Durlacher (January 31, 1837 - 1893) was born in Schmeiheim, Baden, Germany. He emigrated with his family to Pottsville, Pennsylvania in 1852, where he studied and worked in the dry goods business. After being wounded in service in the Union army during the American Civil War he moved to Burlington, Iowa to work in a clothing store. In 1867 Durlacher moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming and worked in another dry fgoods store. The next year he moved farther west to Laramie, where he worked for Ben Hellman in Hellman's store, which started out in a tent and moved up to a log cabin. After working in another store Durlacher started his own in 1871 with partner William Manesse. A permanent building at 203 2nd Street followed in 1872, which also housed Laramie's Masonic Lodge, of which Durlacher was a member. In 1878 Durlacher made a buying trip to the East Coast and was introduced by friends to fellow German immigrant Hannah Gross (b. 1853) and married her in Boston on October 2, 1878. Upon their arrival in Laramie they bought the house at 501 South 5th Street from Charles and Ella Klingerman for $2000. The family enjoyed an active social life. Simon died in 1893. In 1909 Hannah married Otto Gramm and continued to live in the 5th Street house. She died in 1930.
Simon and Hannah's daughter Hilda lived at the house with husband Neale Roach from 1905 to 1941. The house was sold in 1945 to the First Christian Church, which modified the house for its use. It was sold in 1954 to the Salvation Army. The exterior of the house was stuccoed at about this time to address problems with the brick exterior, whose local bricks were known for poor durability.
Description.
The Durlacher House occupies a corner lot at 5th and Custer Streets. The house is 2-1/2 stories tall, with a stuccoed brick first floor and a shingled second floor. A proch extends across both sides facing the streets. The house has a variety of sash windows, including some with stained glass. A prominent arched window faces 5th Street. The house's interior has been extensively altered for its use as a church and for its present use as a business office, but many original interior features remain. Most of the interior trim has been replaced. 
The Durlacher House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in on March 21, 2011.

Critical reception.
"Commitment to Complications" was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung saw the album as a refinement of Youth Code's sound, saying, ""Commitment to Complications" demonstrates clear growth from the former hardcore kids, establishing Youth Code as a distinctive duo instead of merely a derivative tribute to their influences." Andy O'Connor of "Pitchfork" wrote that the album "strikes the ideal balance between the visceral nature of the innovative L.A. hardcore group Youth Code's demo and the polish in their work since then." In his review of "Commitment to Complications", Hans Rollman of "PopMatters" commended Youth Code for reinvigorating industrial and electronic music, saying the band is undoubtedly worth following.
