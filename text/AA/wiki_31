N-Ethylpentylone

"N"-Ethylpentylone (β-keto-ethylbenzodioxolylpentanamine, βk-ethyl-K, βk-EBDP, ephylone) is a substituted cathinone and stimulant drug which was developed in the 1960s.
It has been reported as a novel designer drug in several countries including the United Kingdom,South Africa, New Zealand, the United States, and Australia. 
In 2018, "N"-ethylpentylone was the most common drug of the cathinone class to be identified in Drug Enforcement Administration seizures.
A doctor, David Caldicott, has said "N"-ethylpentylone "can cause circulation problems, lethal heart palpitations and hallucinations". It has been linked to a number of overdose deaths and mass-casualty incidents, and has increasingly been mis-sold as MDMA.
"N"-Ethylpentylone is primarily a mixed norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It binds to transporters with IC50 values of 37 nM (DAT), 105 nM (NET) and 383 nM (SERT).
Legality.

Alicja Kwade

Alicja Kwade (born 1979, Poland) is a Polish-German contemporary visual artist. Her sculptures and installations focus on the subjectivity of time and space. Kwade lives and works in Berlin.
Early life and education.
Kwade was born in an industrial city of Katowice, what was then communist Poland. She was the daughter of a cultural scientist and gallery owner and conservator, and reports knowing that she wanted to be an artist at as young as five years old. Her family escaped to West Germany in 1987. She grew up in Hannover and at age 19 moved to Berlin were she studied sculpture at the University of the Arts (UdK) in Berlin from 1999 to 2005. In 2002, Kwade spent an Erasmus year at Chelsea College of Arts in London.
Work.
Kwade manipulates common materials like wood, glass, and copper through chemical processes to explore the ephemerality of the physical world. Her works often include reflection, repetitive sounds, and inaccurate doubling to create immersive and experiential spaces that beg viewers to question their perception of reality. In a 2013 interview with ArtReview magazine, Kwade explained “I’m fascinated with the borders between science and suspicion. All the in-betweens. Mr Houdini is one of my biggest heroes.” 
In 2017, Kwade was photographed by Mario Testino for "Vogue" in Venice.
First shown at MIT List Visual Arts Center in 2020, the installation "Light Touch of Totality" is made up of five stainless steel rings, each about 16 feet in diameter, which appear frozen in time at various angles and points of contact. Curtains of stringed beads hang from different parts of the rings, and ungulate slightly with movement of the air in the room. The ring are representative of both planetary rings and longitudinal lines, while the beads represent units of information. In this way, the work aligns with Kwade’s persistent interest in perception and the ways we categorize and understand our world.
Studios.
Since becoming a full-time artist, Kwade has worked from studios in Berlin's Kreuzberg (2008-2011, together with Thomas Kiesewetter) and Weißensee districts (2012-2018). She also completed an artist-in-residence program in Le Vauclin in 2012. In 2018, she moved her practice to a studio in Oberschöneweide, alongside Olafur Eliasson, Christian Jankowski and Jorinde Voigt.
Commissions.
For her first solo public art commission in the United States in 2015, Kwade installed a 16-feet-tall aluminium a 19th-century style clock titled "Against the Run" (2015) at the entrance to Central Park, directly opposite the storied Plaza Hotel; the clock's face moved counter clockwise while the hour and minute hands turned in the opposite direction.
As part of a 2021 revitalization project of 550 Madison Avenue, Kwade created "Solid Sky" (2021), a work comprising a nearly 22,000 kilogram polished spherical quartzite suspended from the ceiling of the glassbox lobby with stainless steel chains.
Exhibitions.
Beginning with her first institutional show at Hamburger Bahnhof in 2008, Kwade had solo exhibitions at Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover; Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt (2015); and Whitechapel Gallery, London (2016); among others. She also participated in the 2015 Venice Biennale. She also produced "Parapivot" for the 2019 Metropolitan Museum of Art Roof Garden Commission.
Personal life.
Since 2000, Kwade has been in a relationship with fellow artist Gregor Hildebrandt.

Andrée Le Coultre

Andrée Le Coultre (1917 – 6 July 1986) was a French painter in the cubist tradition coached by Albert Gleizes. She was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland but spent her entire life in Lyon where her parents moved when she was an infant. She acquired French nationality in 1942 after her marriage to .
Life and education.
Le Coultre and met while taking evening classes from at the École des Beaux-arts de Lyon, where she also met Louis Bellon, Maurice Férréol. She was married to Régny in 1942. She and Régny attended evening classes together from Eugène Claudius-Petit. In 1941, she and Régny visited the potter Anne Dangar who was participating at the artist colony created by Albert Gleizes. In 1942 she participated in an exhibition at Folklore gallery ("Peintures féminines") where she also worked for some time as a secretary. Both attended the "Académie du Minotaure" created by .
Le Coultre's mission was to rapidly find direction and meaning to her work. She read a lot of books on art and artists, and was influenced by Van Gogh, Cézanne, Matisse, Robert Delaunay, André Lhote, Léger, and others. The art of the Middle Ages was also an influence, especially the reds and the blues of the stained glass windows of Chartres Cathedral. Her quest, shared with her husband, turned to the thought of Albert Gleizes, who she first contacted by correspondence in April 1945. Le Coultre wrote, "Gleizes influenced my work towards a structured figurativism."
Her plans at that point were that she and Régny would move either to the artist colony, or nearby Gleizes in St-Rémy-de-Provence; however, in the end, these plans did not come to fruition.
Andrée Le Coultre died on 6 July 1986. On the 12th, according to the wishes of her husband Paul Regny, her coffin was at St. Joseph Church in Tassin, surrounded by the many paintings Le Coultre had painted on the walls of the Church.
Career.
Exhibitions.
In 1946, exhibited a retrospective of Le Coultre's paintings at the "Maison de la Pensée Française". The couple started working that year according to the principles of Albert Gleizes, whom they finally met in 1947 and with whom they remained in regular correspondence, concerning paintings they submitted to him.
She participated with her husband in the decoration of the new Saint Joseph Church in Tassin-la-Demi-Lune, created a Virgin for the church of St. Anne de Menival (Lyon), and a large oil ("l'Imaginaire") for the Jacques Prévert pre-school in La-Demi-Lune.
In 2017, ten of her pieces were exhibited in the Musée de Beaux Arts de Lyon, honoring the donation of eighteen paintings to the museum by their son, Marc Régny.
Teaching.
In 1948 she participated as an instructor along with Paul Régny and in hosting a workshop for amateur artists, the "Arc-en-ciel" (Rainbow), managed by Albert Gleizes. They stayed at Gleizes's home in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.
In 1948, the couple spent a time at Gleizes Méjades property in Provence, giving a workshop on Gleizes's method and his pictorial techniques.
From the late 40s on, Andrée Le Coultre drew on her personal experience of art and creation to convey painting and pictorial techniques to many students either in private lessons, in schools (private primary school Vincent Serre in La-Demi-Lune, and at the school of Social Service in Lyon. After 1968, she taught workshops to children via the administration of the local commune, and painting workshops for senior citizens.
In later years, she gave up teaching children due to her heart condition. She began producing small-format works with colored pencils.
Motifs and themes.
After her debut with Antoine Chartres, she turned toward a more geometric style inspired by André Lhote and Fernand Léger, developing figurative compositions characterized by the colors of Matisse and the stained glass windows of Chartres Cathedral.
Le Coultre was influenced by her 1946 meeting with Albert Gleizes, who subsequently followed her oeuvre. Le Coultre's work became characterized by non-figurative paintings or gouaches composed, following Gleizes's theories, of geometric shapes in muted colors, open circles, and broken lines. But very soon, Le Coultre and Régny began to introduce their own variations to Gleizes's themes and practice, as Gleizes himself wished.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Andrée Le Coultre started exploring themes of her own, alternating non-figurative motifs with a return to specific topics such as religious subjects, where one can feel the influence of medieval art and Irish art, drawn for example from the Old Testament or from the Apocalypse, which gives space for her more imaginary visions to take flight; but also of scenes of daily life where constructions, rhythms, modulations and color harmonies like reds and blues can come into play.
Criticism and commentary.
According to Olivier Houg, a return to a more figurative style in the 1960s and 1970s gave her the opportunity to show her talents in design and color. In the notes for a 1978 exhibition, Le Coultre said that after following rigorous principles [of Gleizes] for some time, she was becoming more spontaneous: "Imagination is grafted onto construction to express a space where 'creatures' arise and evolve, sometimes in spite of myself. In this effort, the 'blueprint' is abandoned and each painting is an adventure. I don't know where I'm going to end up and who I'm going to encounter en route."
In 1985, René Deroudille said that Le Coultre "takes us to passionate, unknown, far-away lands..." and went on: "With allusions to the deep, warm colors of stained glass, her colors announce their dominance..., scarlet shades with numerous, subtle modulations. Painting becomes a spiritual exercise, and participates in the deep universe of the collective unconscious, as explored and expressed by the poet."
Jean-Jacques Lerrant, writing for the catalog of the "Salon du Sud-Est" exhibition, said, "What an itinerary! Born of Cubist rationality, tinged by Gleizes' esotericism, Andrée Le Coultre turns to flora, fauna, castles of dreams... Nothing has been in vain. She has the power to capture the moment of metamorphoses."
Works.
In 2017, eighteen of Le Coultre's works were donated to the Musée de Beaux Arts de Lyon by their son, Marc Régny, occasioning an exhibition of her works, juxtaposed with two by Albert Gleizes in the museum's permanent collection, "Danseuse espagnole" (1916) and "Terre et ciel" (1935).

Janet Delaney

Janet Delaney (born 1952) is an American photographer and educator based in Berkeley, California. Her books include "South of Market" (2013) and "Public Matters" (2018).
Life and work.
Born in 1952 in Compton, California, Delaney relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1971. She received a BFA with honors from San Francisco State University (1975), and an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute (1981).
Teaching.
Delaney was a professor at the College of San Mateo from 1980 to 1991. She was a guest professor at Santa Clara University during 1986, 1989, and 1995. She taught at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1991, 1994, 1997, 2014, and 2015. From 1998 to 2015, she was an Adjunct Professor in the Visual Studies department at the University of California, Berkeley. 
"South of Market".
Delaney is best known for her series, "South of Market," which she began in 1978 when she moved to the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, an area undergoing transition due to gentrification and urban renewal. Using a large format camera and color film, Delaney photographed her neighbors in their places of work, businesses, apartments, and out on the street. She also conducted oral interviews with many of her subjects and produced 35 mm slides, which she showed alongside her photographs in the exhibition "Form Follows Finance: A Survey of the South of Market" at SF Camerawork (1982) and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (1983).
In 2013, Mack published the photographs with excerpts from the recorded interviews in "South of Market 1978-1986," Delaney's first book. Two years later, the work was featured in the exhibition "Janet Delaney: South of Market," at the de Young Museum, San Francisco from January to July, 2015.
Delaney returned to the South of Market area to photograph the radical changes that had occurred in the decades since she first lived there, several examples of which were published in the catalogue that accompanied the show at the de Young.
"Public Matters".
Following her original work on "South of Market," Delaney began her series titled "Public Matters" in 1982. "Public Matters" centers primarily around the Latino community and Mission District during the 1980s, a rather tumultuous political period. Once again using a large format camera and color film, Delaney took to the streets with San Francisco natives to capture them during community gatherings, like the annual Cinco de Mayo parade, during political rallies, like the Peace, Jobs, and Justice marches, or simply while lounging in front of their homes and businesses. "Public Matters" captures the spirit of San Francisco during a period of high immigration and political strife, documenting the resilience and energy of the city's communities. 
In 2018, Mack published the photographs in a photo book with the same name as the series. That year, Delaney featured the work in a solo exhibit at the Euqinom Gallery in San Francisco, from November to December, 2018.

Delaney's work is held in the following permanent collections:

Bamenda pygmy shrew

The Bamenda pygmy shrew ("Sylvisorex silvanorum") is a terrestrial species of shrew described by Hutterer, Riegert and Sedláček in 2009. It was first discovered during a Museum Koenig expedition to the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon in 1974, but was not recorded again until 2001, when partial skull remnants were located in the pellets of the endemic African grass owl.
Description.
A relatively small species, the Bamenda pygmy shrew measures 5.2 centimetres in body length, with a tail length of around 4.4 centimetres. The shrew is primarily dark brown in colour, with a slightly lighter patch on the stomach. The species is distinguishable from other endemic varieties due to its comparatively reduced proportions and diminutive cranial size. It is possible that the shrew is sister taxa with the Volcano shrew, found in the Albertine Rift, as the pair share numerous characteristics and features.
Distribution and habitat.
The species are known to be endemic to a pair of caldera craters found near Bamenda, known as the Bafut Ngemba Forest Reserve. The lower crater contains the remnants of a past lake, while the previously flooded upper crater contains a wet grassland. The montane forests surrounding the former appears to be the primary habitat, in addition to adjacent bamboo enclaves and grasslands. The holotype of the shrew was located in dense undergrowth near a stream, suggesting that the population nearby is likely to greater in prevalence in this specific locality.

Claudy Jongstra

Claudy Jongstra (born 6 February 1963) is a Dutch artist and textile designer.
Biography.
Jongstra studied fashion design at the Utrecht School of the Arts between 1982 and 1989. Her work is characterized by her use of wool in the form of handcrafted felt. Much of the wool she uses is from Drenthe Heath sheep, which she raises herself in the Northern Netherlands. She often colors the wool with vegetable dyes made from vegetables grown in her own garden. 
She is known, in particular, for the unique kinds of hybrid or nuno felts she creates through combining a variety of materials with wool. These combined fibers include silk, linen, and chiffons, as well as fibers from animals such as yak or camel. Her felting process is also distinguished by the multiple stages of reworking required for achieving certain effects.
One of her early major assignments involved working on the fabrics for the Jedi costumes in . She also produced fabrics for fashion and furniture designers, including Alexander van Slobbe, Maarten Baas, Hella Jongerius, John Galliano, Christian Lacroix and Donna Karan. Later in her career, Jongstra started creating large-scale works of art, displayed at museums such as the Fries Museum, the Provinciehuis in Leeuwarden, the Amsterdam Public Library and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
In 2009, her work was selected for inclusion in "Fashioning Felt", an international show on felt sponsored by the Smithsonian, which was exhibited at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City. 
The work of Claudy Jongstra is included in various museum collections, including the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Rijksmuseum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of Modern Art.

Angelito (TV series)

Angelito is a Philippine daytime drama series that ran in ABS-CBN's "Kapamilya Gold" afternoon block and worldwide via The Filipino Channel from November 2011 to late 2012. It had two shows, the first being and the second being . The series starred JM de Guzman and Charee Pineda, the former playing the titular character.
Conception.
Due to the rise of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, ABS-CBN made drama shows based on lives of young parents to warn and lecture the public of the dangers of such incidents. While most of the shows presented the subject matter from the perspective of a young mother, ABS-CBN then made a plan to present a show tackling the same subject matter, but from the perspective of the father, as little was known about young fathers and their struggles. This was when ideas for Angelito were born.
JM De Guzman and Charee Pineda, who were starring in the 2011 remake of Mula sa Puso, were chosen for the roles of the main characters, Angelito and Rosalie, respectively. Also, three of their fellow cast members from the same show, Devon Seron, Sue Ramirez, and Beauty Gonzalez, joined the cast, with Gonzales appearing later. Felix Roco and Goin' Bulilit alumnus Carl John Barrameda were cast as Angelito's friends.
To prepare for the roles, De Guzman and Pineda attended a workshop exercise known as "immersion" which helped them research about teenage pregnancy and parenthood. During the exercise, the two bonded with teenage parents, who shared their stories and struggles with the actors. After more extensive research, the two began to take their roles.
Veteran actors like Al Tantay, Snooky Serna, and Elizabeth Oropesa also joined the cast. The three veterans mentored the younger cast about their roles and how they should be taken seriously. Oropesa, who had experiences being a teen parent herself. mentored De Guzman and Pineda about their roles as young parents and narrated how she raised her own child like a best friend. Oropesa also told the other young casts who take on the story that they should not only view it as "just a job" but also a "mission" to spread the word about implications and dangers of teenage pregnancy.
Shows.
"Batang Ama" (2011).
Student-couple Angelito Santos and Rosalie Dimaano live a normal countryside life but a sudden turn of events would change their lives when Rosalie is suddenly pregnant. Dismayed by the unexpected pregnancy, both the Santoses and the Dimaanos forbid any communication between the two. As Angelito takes his child with him and runs away to the Philippine capital Manila, he strives to become a good father to his child, Jun-jun. But raising a child as a teen proves to be such a hard task, especially since Angelito is doing it on his own. Knowing the pains and ordeals of having a dysfunctional family, Angelito vows to do everything to raise Jun-jun well and find a way to reunite with Rosalie. Five years later, the ex-lovers' paths meet; Jun-jun enters childhood and Rosalie is bound to marry her rich fiancé. Will Angelito's dream of having a complete family ever come true?
"Bagong Yugto" (2011).
Angelito and Rosalie are now happily married and live a happy family life with their son Junjun. Meanwhile, Jenny starts a new life in Singapore only to discover that she is pregnant with Angelito's child during their relationship. Pledging not to reappear in Angelito's life again, she turns to her childhood friend Raffy for comfort, but circumstances prompt her to return to the Philippines and cross paths with the Santos family once more.

List of Mexican–American War monuments and memorials

This is a list of monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 and its veterans on both sides. One of the most significant is the Mexico City National Cemetery, one of the first U.S. national cemeteries. The U.S. did not start its official system of national cemeteries until an 1862 act of Congress authorized U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to proceed. However, on September 28, 1850, an American military cemetery was established in Mexico City in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War.
Other monuments and memorials in Mexico commemorate those lost in the Mexican side of the conflict, particularly the Niños Héroes, seven army cadets who lost their lives defending Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City. There are other monuments in Mexico City, and in Monterrey, Nogales, Puebla, San Miguel de Cozumel, and Toluca de Lerdo.
In the United States, "conspicuously missing" is any memorial to the Mexican–American War on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. But there are monuments in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.
Mexico.
Helen Escobedo in the book "Mexican Monuments: Strange Encounters" notes:
Literally hundreds of monuments commemorate the Niños Héroes, the seven boys who defended the castle of Chapultepec alone against the American invasion in 1847. According to legend the last one alive wrapped himself in the Mexican flag and jumped off the parapet rather than surrender.
Monterrey.
The Niños Héroes Park, Monterrey. There is a statue in the park of the six heroes.

Tennessee.
There may be just two significant monuments to the Mexican–American War in Tennessee:

There are monuments to Mexican–Americans who served in World War II in various places, e.g. in Emporia, Kansas, and in Sacramento, California (which was vandalized). There are also [[List of Texas Revolution monuments and memorials|monuments and memorials relating to the Texas Revolution (1835–36)]], which preceded the Mexican–American War by a decade.

State unemployment tax act

Taxes under State Unemployment Tax Act (or SUTA) are those designed to finance the cost of state unemployment insurance benefits in the United States, which make up all of unemployment insurance expenditures in normal times, and the majority of unemployment insurance expenditures during downturns, with the remainder paid in part by the federal government for "emergency" benefit extensions.
The tax is unique in two primary aspects. First, the tax is experience rated which means that tax rates are firm-specific and the rate a firm faces updates each year to reflect the cost of the benefits that firm's former employees have received recently. Because it is primarily firms in stress that generate layoffs, these tax increases target firms that are already under strain. For this reason, states limit how high they allow taxes to rise, but these limits vary by almost an order of magnitude from state to state.
The second unique feature of UI taxes under SUTA is that the taxable base is ~$10,000 (on average, varies by state) per employee, much less than the average yearly earnings of a given worker. Because of this feature, firms pay a fixed "lump sum" tax per worker they employ. This provides a modest incentive for firms to reduce unskilled and part-time work in favor of skilled and full-time work.
One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program.

Yair Netanyahu

Yair Netanyahu (; born 26 July 1991) is the eldest son of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He is known for making incendiary statements in defense of his father on social media.
Early life and education.
Netanyahu was born on 26 July 1991 to Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. He has a brother, Avner, and a half-sister, Noa Netanyahu-Roth; Noa is Benjamin Netanyahu's daughter by his first wife, Miriam Weizmann.
Netanyahu majored in theater at the High School for the Arts in Jerusalem, before serving in the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. He previously worked as social media director for Shurat HaDin, an Israeli NGO that provides legal services to victims of terrorist attacks. After finishing his army service, Netanyahu studied international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Netanyahu also studied at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya.
Career.
Netanyahu is a staunch defender of his father’s policies and has published his opinions in op-eds, including at "Breitbart News", an American far-right news and opinion website. In late 2017, neo-Nazi website "The Daily Stormer" described itself as "The World’s #1 Yair Netanyahu fansite" after he posted an antisemitic meme portraying his father's political opponents as puppets controlled by George Soros. Netanyahu later deleted the post following backlash.
In December 2018, he was suspended from Facebook for 24 hours after posting anti-Muslim content. One of Netanyahu's comments read: "There will never be peace with those monsters in the form of men that have called themselves ‘Palestinians’ since 1964".
Netanyahu was put on leave in March 2019 after deriding President Reuven Rivlin for his work on Arab-Israeli coexistence.
In May 2019, Netanyahu expressed support for right-wing nationalist figures Viktor Orbán, Matteo Salvini, Nigel Farage and Geert Wilders in the 2019 European Parliament election. In the same month, some observers hypothesized that Netanyahu was looking for a job in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although Netanyahu has denied that he is looking for a political career. In June 2019, Netanyahu met with Katrina Pierson, a senior advisor for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.
In September 2019, Netanyahu accused former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995, of having "murdered Holocaust survivors on the Altalena". The comments were disavowed by his father. He has compared Roni Alsheikh, the Israel Police chief who played a role in the Netanyahu corruption investigations, to the fictional mobster Tony Soprano. While being questioned by police during the investigations, Netanyahu called the police "Stasi" and "Gestapo" and said they were worse than the mafia. He also accused Nir Hafetz and Gideon Saar of various crimes.
In November 2020, Netanyahu launched his own right-wing podcast called "The Yair Netanyahu Show", with episodes spoken in both English and Hebrew. His first guest was Brazilian politician Eduardo Bolsonaro, the third son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Legal cases.
In January 2018, a scandal erupted when a recording of Netanyahu's visit to a Tel Aviv strip club in 2015 was leaked. In the tape, Netanyahu discussed strippers and referred to a controversial gas deal signed by his father. He filed a lawsuit for 1 million NIS ($272,000) against his driver, who allegedly recorded the tape.
On 7 July 2019, he won a libel suit against Israeli Labor Party activist Abie Binyamin for claiming that Netanyahu was hiding millions in offshore accounts.
In November 2019, Netanyahu was sued for slander after sharing a Facebook post claiming that former Walla news site editor, Avi Alkalay, was a plant for the Wexner Foundation. In February 2020, he was ordered to pay damages and legal costs totalling $81,000. Netanyahu appealed the decision, but his appeal was rejected by the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court in July 2021.
Personal life.
Netanyahu used to live with his parents at Beit Aghion, the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem. In July 2021, he and his parents had to leave the prime minister's residence after Netanyahu was ousted from power.
In January 2014, Norwegian newspaper "Dagen" reported that Netanyahu was dating Sandra Leikanger, a Norwegian student. The couple had met while they were students at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. The news resulted in outraged reactions from Israeli politicians due to Leikanger being a Non-Jew.
In 2015, Netanyahu briefly dated Lee Levi, a Danish-Israeli model and student.

Lincheng Outrage

The Lincheng Outrage, also known as the Lincheng Incident (), refers to the seizure of the luxury "Blue Express" train traveling between Shanghai and Beijing and the taking of over 300 hostages by bandits near the town of Lincheng County (present-day Xuecheng District, Zaozhuang), Shandong Province, China on the night of May 5–6, 1923.
Attack and hostage-taking.
On May 5, 1923, twelve hundred bandits, mostly former soldiers under General Zhang Jingyao who followed Shandong warlord Sun Meiyao (孙美瑶) after their discharge from the military, attacked and then derailed the "Blue Express" near the town of Lincheng (Xuecheng) on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Shandong Province close to the Jiangsu-Shandong border. The bandits looted the train and killed a number of Chinese passengers as well as a British subject, Joseph Rothman after he refused to surrender his valuables. They took 300 passengers hostage, including 25 westerners, most of whom were Americans. British, French, Italian, German, and Danish nationals were also among those captured. The hostages were forced on a 10-day march to the bandits' mountain base at Paotzeku. Some of the more prominent hostages included Lucy Aldrich, eldest daughter of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and sister-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. J. B. Powell, editor of "China Weekly Review," and Commodore Guiseppe Musso, a wealthy and influential Italian who was the chief attorney in the Shanghai French Concession.
The women were released within a couple of days of the kidnapping, while the remaining male hostages were held for over a month as negotiations led by the U.S. Minister to China Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman and American China hand Roy Scott Anderson took place. The bandits demanded as ransom the removal of Chinese government troops from Shandong, an official pardon for the kidnappers, reinstatement or enrollment into the army for those among the bandits who wished it, and guarantees by six foreign powers that the demands would be met. Ultimately the Shanghai Green Gang leader Du Yuesheng secured the release of the remaining hostages on June 12, 1923 with an $85,000 ransom ($1.2 million in today's prices).
Aftermath.
Many of the bandits were accepted into the military and Sun Meiyao and other leaders received military commissions. Within six months, most of the bandits inducted into the military were machine-gunned and their chief, Sun Meiyao, was executed for suspected ongoing ties to local bandits.
The capture of the "Blue Express" created an international sensation and symbolized for many the collapse of legitimacy of the Chinese government. Following the incident, foreign governments pressured the Chinese to increase security along railway lines. Expatriate communities in China feared the episode signaled a new "Boxer Rebellion" and put into question the stability of the Chinese government. As a result, foreign powers urged that railway security be placed under foreign control. The Chinese government resisted, instead placing the railway system under military control and creating a special railway guard under the command of General Tang Zaili. Armed guards were placed on every train. Foreign powers also used the incident to place financial pressure on the fragile Chinese government, demanding indemnities and compensation for medical expenses for foreign hostages and repayment of lost earnings.
Popular media.
The Lincheng Outrage provided the inspiration for the 1932 Marlene Dietrich film "Shanghai Express".

Amar Akbar Anthony (2018 film)

Amar Akbar Anthony is a 2018 Indian Telugu-language action film co-written and directed by Sreenu Vaitla which features Ravi Teja in his first triple role and Ileana D'Cruz playing the female lead in her comeback in Telugu cinema after six years. Also marking the fourth collaboration between Teja and Vaitla after "Nee Kosam", "Venky" and "Dubai Seenu", the film was produced by Naveen Yerneni, Y. Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri under their banner Mythri Movie Makers. Pre-production of the film began in June 2017, and the film's principal photography commenced at New York in April 2018. The narrative centers around Amar, a man suffering from multiple personality disorder, who is on a vengeful killing spree but is often hindered by the emergence of two more personalities he is unaware of.
The film, released worldwide on 16 November 2018, was panned by critics and audiences, becoming a box office bomb.
Plot.
Set in New York, the film revolves around Amar (Ravi Teja), who once freed from the prison, kills a businessman before extracting from him a "Fedo" ring. However, Amar is unaware of the fact that he has multiple personality disorder that causes him to assume two more identities in addition to his own. Each identity has a trigger that results in its emergence. Whenever something breaks, he transforms into Akbar, a muslim man who keeps helping the needy. Whenever he sees someone acting abnormally, he transforms into Mark Anthony, a calm doctor. Whenever something explodes, he becomes himself. While as Akbar, he meets Pooja (Ileana D'Cruz), a young woman who also has MPD. In a gym, a few men try to flirt with her and them telling her to "trust them" triggers the alternate personality which violently beats them up. Pooja is surprised to meet Akbar as Dr. Anthony who soon starts her therapy.
In the meanwhile, FBI officer Balwant Kharge (Abhimanyu Singh) investigates the murder of the first businessman and being a partner, he keeps informing the remaining three businessmen who might be the next targets. Evidences bring him closer to the realization that Amar might be involved in the murder. Pooja's uncle Jalal Akbar (Sayaji Shinde) unites with her. Her real name is revealed to be Aishwarya. With time, Amar ends up realizing that something is wrong with him. He visits the grave of his parents with flowers but is chased by Kharge and his fellow officers. He tries to kill the next target but somehow fails. He hires Bobby (Sunil), a random stranger, to find out what's wrong with him. He realizes that he has MPD, while the flashback is revealed in the words of Jalal Akbar to Aishwarya and Dr. Mark Anthony (Subhalekha Sudhakar)'s words to Kharge. It is revealed that Amar and Aishwarya's families were betrayed by four businessmen whom they trust and awarded "Fedo" rings. The explosion of their house triggered the disorder in Amar and the menace created by the businessmen triggered it in Aishwarya. The businessmen tried to kill Amar, Aishwarya and Jalal in a subsequent chase but failed. Aishwarya and Amar were admitted to Dr. Anthony's school where they got separated by circumstances.
Back in the present, Amar manages to kill the second businessman by strangulating him while also leaving behind clues that alert Kharge. However, this disorder causes Amar to miss Saboo Menon (Adhitya), the target he earlier failed to kill. He then manipulates the members of WATA, an association for Telugu people, into killing Menon. They're taken in and end up leading Kharge to the truth. Karan Arora (Tarun Arora), the fourth businessman, calls Amar for a meeting in exchange for Jalal and Aishwarya's freedom. Realizing his loved ones are still alive, Amar arrives for the exchange and in the presence of Kharge and his assistant, breaks into a fight that leaves the henchmen wounded and Arora dead. He extracts the last Fedo ring and then leaves the scene. Kharge is disappointed to realize he kidnapped someone else instead of Aishwarya. Amar then visits his long-left house where he unites with Aishwarya, with Dr. Anthony explaining to Jalal that their mental condition will now start returning to normal. Kharge decides to testify against Amar but instead covers up for him after being blackmailed by a latter.

Dennis Dechaine case

On March 18, 1989, thirty-one-year-old Dennis Dechaine of Bowdoinham, Maine was convicted for the 1988 murder of twelve-year-old Sarah Cherry, who was abducted, tortured and found in a wooded area. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Dechaine has filed a number of appeals, maintaining that he is innocent. However, he remains incarcerated at Maine State Prison in Warren, Maine. This case is considered by many to be the most infamous crime in the state of Maine.
Murder.
On July 6, 1988, twelve-year-old Sarah Cherry was abducted while babysitting at a home in a rural part of Bowdoin, Maine. A couple of items were left in the driveway of the house (the abduction scene) that linked Dennis Dechaine, a thirty-one-year-old farmer, to the crime, such as an estimate with his name on it. Several days later, Cherry's body was found hidden in a wooded area. She had been bound with rope, assaulted sexually with birch sticks, stabbed, and then strangled with a scarf. Both the rope and scarf, as well as the items in the driveway, came from Dechaine's truck. However, Dechaine claims that the items from his truck were taken from the actual perpetrator, and were used to implicate him. Dechaine's account of that day was that he left his farm and drove to the woods to do drugs, getting lost in the process. After which, he came across an elderly couple and flagged down a police car.
During questioning from the authorities, Dechaine lied about going fishing, his employment, and residence. According to Dechaine, he lied due to his use of illegal drugs. Dechaine's red Toyota pickup truck was found approximately 450 feet from where Cherry's body was found. Forensic analysis did not recover any evidence that Cherry had been in the truck, nor did a tracking dog.
Conviction and appeals.
The case went to trial in March 1989. On March 18, Dechaine was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Since his conviction, Dechaine has filed numerous appeals for a new trial, citing that male DNA under Sarah Cherry's fingernails did not match him. In April 2014, another appeal for a new trial was denied. It argued that the DNA evidence, which was not available at Dechaine's trial, implicated someone else.
In July 2015, Dechaine's appeal to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court for a new trial was denied, concluding that the DNA evidence was insufficient.
In October 2016, Dechaine's final appeal for a new trial was denied by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston.
Coverage.
Dechaine's case was featured on the television program, "The Investigators", in 2005. 
A documentary entitled "Murder in America: The Sarah Cherry Story" was released about this case.
A book entitled "Human Sacrifice" was released by James P. Moore on Dechaine's case in 2002.
This case helped inspire the novel "Death at Breakfast" that was released by Beth Gutcheon in 2016.

Dru Joyce II

Dru Joyce II, known as “Coach Dru,” is a high school basketball coach. He is the founder of the Northeast Ohio Basketball Association, star of the documentary More than a Game author of the book “Beyond Championships: A Playbook for Winning at Life,” and the National Championship winning coach for the 2003 St. Vincent St. Mary boys basketball team, led by LeBron James and the “Fab Four.”
Background.
Dru Joyce II was born in East Liverpool, Ohio on July 26, 1955. In 1978, he graduated from Ohio University with a degree in Business Administration, and began a career in sales for Hunt-Wesson Foods in Pittsburgh, PA. In 1984, Joyce and his family relocated to Akron, Ohio. He began coaching his son Dru Joyce III (“Little Dru”) in 1995, and had a knack for finding promising young basketball talent in his community. One of the young talents that caught Coach Dru's eye at the Summit Lake Recreation Center was a 10-year-old boy named LeBron James. Coach Dru convinced LeBron's mother, Gloria, to let him join an AAU basketball team called the Shooting Stars. Little Dru and LeBron, soon joined by Sian Cotton and Willie McGee, continued to play together under coach Dru's leadership and developed into remarkable basketball players.
In 1999, Coach Dru was named assistant coach of the St. Vincent-St. Mary boys basketball team under NCAA coach Keith Dambrot. That fall, Dru Joyce III, LeBron James, Sian Cotton, and Willie McGee all entered their freshman year at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, determined to fulfill their dream of a National Championship. They won the 2000 Division III State Basketball Championship, which they would repeat in 2001, joined by sophomore transfer Romeo Travis, who would become the fifth member of what would be known as the “Fab Five.”
In the fall of 2001, Coach Dru was named the head basketball coach for St. Vincent-St. Mary. After a rough 2001-2002 season, Coach Dru and the Fab Five regrouped and came back stronger than ever in 2003. Not only did they clinch the Division II Ohio State Boys Basketball Championship, they were also declared Nation Champions by USA Today.
Coach Dru began hosting an annual AAU basketball tournament in 2005. Originally called the King James Shooting Stars, the tournament was later renamed the Dru Joyce Classic.
Today, Coach Dru continues to serve as head basketball coach at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, OH, as well as the head of the Northeast Ohio Basketball Association. He is also the founder of the Dru Joyce Classic, one of the top 5 youth AAU basketball tournaments in the United States.
Dru Joyce II published his first book, “Beyond Championships: A Playbook for Winning at Life,” in April 2015. The foreword is written by his former player, LeBron James.

1981 UK Athletics Championships

The 1981 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Antrim Stadium, Antrim. It was the first time that a national track and field championship was held in Northern Ireland.
It was the fifth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1981 AAA Championships.
David Ottley won his fourth straight title in the men's javelin throw. Among the athletes to defend their 1980 UK titles were Cameron Sharp (men's 100 metres), Carol Tyson (race walk) and Louise Miller (high jump). Three athletes won UK title doubles, all of them women: Linsey MacDonald won the short sprint double, Gillian Dainty took both middle-distance titles, while Venissa Head was both shot put and discus throw champion.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1981 European Cup. Reflecting the secondary status of the UK event at national level, none of the British individual medallists there were present at UK Championships, though all members of the medal-winning women's 4 × 400 metres relay reached the podium in Antrim (Linda Forsyth, Michelle Scutt, Verona Elder and Joslyn Hoyte-Smith).

Exhale (Arthur Blythe album)

Exhale, is the final album by saxophonist Arthur Blythe which was recorded in 2002 and released on the Savant label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, arwulf arwulf called it an "enjoyable album". In JazzTimes, John Litweiler wrote: "the leader himself casts a peculiarly gloomy, out-of-character spell. Blythe’s strengths-big sound, aggressive attack and bright melodic imagination-are best at up tempos and on pieces with chord changes, wherein the active harmonic structure lends shape to his frequently discontinuous lines. "Exhale" has too many slow tempos and one-chord pieces; moreover, his sound now is limpid and his attack laid-back ... "Exhale" must have simply been a bad day". In The Guardian, John Fordham observed "Not perfect playing, but very compelling music from a unique improviser, and the strange group sound grows on you".

Joyce's 71st New York Regiment March

Joyce's 71st N.Y. Regiment March is an American march composed by band director, arranger, and composer Thornton Barnes Boyer (1856-1936) in 1881. Boyer's "most famous" composition, it is a classic of the American parade and concert band march repertoire, and is regularly performed by U.S. military bands today.
History.
Dedicated to the regimental band of the 71st New York Infantry Regiment, "one of the most well-known military bands of the 19th century," Boyer composed the march while living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and employed by the J. W. Pepper Music Company, which "quickly published" the march after receiving it. The "Joyce" referenced in the march's title is Thomas Joyce, who founded the 71st Regiment's wind band after the unit became part of the New York National Guard in the aftermath of the Civil War. Known as "The American Guard" beginning in 1853, when their Ogden long rifles were replaced with bayonet-carrying muskets, the 71st New York Regiment was founded on October 23, 1850, and took part in the First Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the occupation of Alexandria, Virginia, and the Battle of Gettysburg.
Boyer had a long experience with military music throughout his life, and "after having written music for the 225th anniversary of Philadelphia in 1907, [he]...was music director for the 6th Illinois Regiment band, and then [moved] to Keokuk, IA, where he occupied a similar position with the 50th Iowa Volunteer regiment band." Born on October 20, 1857, in Berks County, Pennsylvania, he passed away in California on April 28, 1936.
Arrangements.
In 1937, Mayhew Lake created a well-known arrangement of the march, adding "a euphonium countermelody and some of the rhythmic patterns." Lake's arrangement also "altered the repeats, added many fills, and changed the trio key from G-flat major (relative to E-flat minor) to the parallel E-flat major."

David Nance is an American rock guitarist, singer and songwriter from Grand Island, Nebraska.
Nance was born in Grand Island and lived there as a child before moving to Omaha, where he gigged locally as a singer-songwriter. He played live and self-produced and released lo-fi demo recordings which brought him local attention; some of these were whole-album covers of records such as "Berlin" by Lou Reed, "Goats Head Soup" by the Rolling Stones, and "Beatles for Sale". In 2013 he relocated to Los Angeles where he recorded three albums' worth of material, all of which he scrapped, describing them as "failed attempts". In 2016, his album "More than Enough" was picked up for distribution by Ba Da Bing Records. He followed in 2017 with a second release for Ba Da Bing, "Negative Boogie", and toured the United States after it was issued in July of that year. Despite having been recorded formally in a studio, the album retained the lo-fi styling of Nance's earlier work.

SS Collaroy

SS "Collaroy" was an iron paddle steamer which often travelled between Newcastle and Sydney. The ship was named after a sheep station near Cassilis in the Hunter Valley, Australia. It was launched in 1853 in Birkenhead, England. The ship's name is now the location of the present day suburb of Collaroy.
Stranding at Collaroy.
Four months after extensive repairs, the ship became beached close to Pittwater Road at Collaroy on 20 January 1881. A navigational error was given as a cause, when the ship attempted to avoid Long Reef near Sydney in heavy fog, without the captain's order. A report in the "Sydney Evening News" suggests the "Collaroy" was in an unofficial race with another coastal steamer, the "Morpeth". And that a further westerly course would assist in reaching port in a faster time.
Ship's mate Richard Drew stated that he did not see the Broken Bay light, several miles to the north of Long Reef. Another report said he also lost sight of the light at south head. At 3:55 am, ship's mate Richard Drew allegedly advised the captain of dense fog. A land form was noticed, incorrectly assumed to be Long Reef. After being on deck for twenty minutes, breaking waves were noticed on the starboard bow. The "Collaroy" was proceeding to the beach at ten knots. Orders were given to reverse engines. However, the ship breached the sand without great impact, and was unable to be shifted by the ship's reversing motor.
Initial attempts to drag the ship from the beach were unsuccessful. When Captain Thompson and five other men were attempting to connect the hawser in a smaller boat. All were all thrown overboard by a wave. One of the crew members was drowned. Hercules Dalziel from the Shetland Islands. Reports said he was tangled in nearby seaweed.
On another attempt, the hawser became detached from the rescue tugs. The ship was beached for over three years. The stranded ship became a tourist attraction. The master Captain Martin Thompson and mate Mr Richard Drew had their licenses suspended for three months.
Recovery from the beach.
The new owner, John Robertson of Botany paid £200 for the wreckage before the ship was recovered.
The "Collaroy" was described as so deep in the sand that the workmen could "step on her sponsons", while its hull was described as "full of water". With considerable labour the vessel was raised off the sand and turned head to
sea. A purpose-built cradle was made around the hull which was then swung so that the bow pointed seaward. A ‘way’ or launching ramp was then built ahead of the recovered steamer towards the water. Three additional ‘kedge’ anchors was placed out in the water adjacent to the steamer and attached to the bows. The steam tug "Commodore" again assisted in pulling "Collaroy" down the purpose-built ramp when the cable snapped. A second attempt also saw the line parting.
On the third attempt, hydraulic power was employed at the stern of the ship and with the assistance of the tug "Leveret", the "Collaroy" was freed, and hauled from the beach at high tide, 7:30 pm on 9 September 1884. This was met with much celebration from local residents and tourists. And then towed to Darling Harbour in Sydney.
After a week's maintenance on the slipway at Sydney, it was reported that "her engines worked splendidly". A Rodger's small palm anchor was found at the wreck site in 1963 and an admiralty type anchor was also discovered at Collaroy in 2001.
Cargo and passengers.
At the time of the beaching, the ship's cargo consisted of 7 bales of wool, 170 bags of potatoes, 200 hides, 40 casks of tallow, 40 pigs and 30 sheep. The livestock was successfully landed and driven into a paddock close to the wreck. All twenty-four passengers (including 14 saloon and ten in steerage) were successfully brought ashore with their luggage in the starboard lifeboat, in three or four trips. The ladies and children were either carried through the breakers or waded ashore themselves. All but one of the forty aboard were safely landed, many being taken to Manly by a fleet of horse-drawn coaches.
Fate.
In February 1888, the "Collaroy" was sold to its final owner, Alexander Burns. The ship was refitted as a schooner or barkentine rigged sailing ship, with the engine and paddles removed. The "Collaroy" sailed from Sydney on or about 24 April 1889, bound for Eureka, Humboldt County, California. The cargo was 500 tons of coal, and a crew of ten hands all told. The ship encountered fog five miles north of the entrance to Eureka Harbour on 7 July and was wrecked. No loss of life was recorded. The actions of Captain Alfred Ball were judged as professional, competent and without blame.

<doc id="56791569" url="?curid=56791569" title="Carpathian Front">
Carpathian Front

The Carpathian Front of World War I was a theater of conflict, part of the greater Eastern Front, centered on the Carpathian Mountains in which Austro-Hungary faced Russian forces. More than half of the 1.1 million Austro-Hungarian troops deployed on the Carpathian Front in the first four months of 1915 were killed, injured, captured, or incapacitated by disease, however, casualties became so high that the Austro-Hungarian army eventually lost detailed track of losses.
According to Prit Buttar, "The rugged peaks and passes of the Carpathians formed a natural barrier between Galicia, now in Russian hands, and the great plain of Hungary and the Danube valley. At the time, there were five main passes through the mountains, at Wyszkov, Verecke, Uzsok, Lupkov, and Dukla." At the beginning of 1915, the Austro-Hungarian forces along the Carpathians included (west to east) Archduke Joseph Ferdinand of Austria's Fourth Army, Svetozar Boroević's Third Army with the VII, X, and XVIII Corps, and Alexander von Linsingen's South Army. Russian forces consisted of Aleksei Brusilov's 8th Army, with the XXIV, XII, and VII Corps, reinforced by the XXII by the end of January. Austro-Hungary's Conrad planned a drive northwards from the Carpathians to commence on 22 January, while the Russian Army planned an attack southwards to commence on 25 January. By 26 January, Linsingen's South Army was able to take the Verecke Pass, and advance onto the Uzsok Pass, while the Austro-Hungarian Third Army, after some initial success, had been driven back to their starting line. On 5 February, the Russians captured the important rail link of Mezőlaborc, while Boroević's Third Army of 135,000 men, suffered almost 89,000 dead, wounded, sick, or captured. The Russian ranks suffered as much, as the first campaign in the Carpathians came to an end. 
Kusmanek, the Przemyśl commander, estimated he had enough supplies to last until March. This prompted Conrad to try and advance past the Russian lines along the Carpathians once again, ordering Eduard von Böhm-Ermolli's Second Army to reach Przemyśl by 12 March. Kolomea was captured by Pflanzer-Baltin on 16 February, and Stanislau on 20 February. However, the Russians transferred their Ninth Army to that sector, and by early March, "Stavka" placed increased emphasis on a southern campaign. An invasion of Hungary would be an attempt to knock the Austro-Hungarian Empire out of the war, and according to Buttar, "In addition to weakening Germany by eliminating its main ally, this would induce Romania and Italy to enter the war against the Central Powers." Heavy snow in mid-March, and Russian counterattacks meant little real change in battlefield positions, until 20 March when the Russian offensive commenced. On 22 March, Przemyśl surrendered. With Conrad's front line in danger of retreat, Georg von der Marwitz's "Beskidenkorps" counterattacked, forcing the Russians to be driven back and their Eighth and Ninth Armies put on the defensive.
Prit Buttar noted, "A glance at the maps of the campaign shows the futility of such operations for both sides. The bloodshed was enormous for the modest gains and losses, ranking the Carpathians fighting as amongst the most ineffective of the entire war."

<doc id="56791597" url="?curid=56791597" title="Lucius Cossonius Gallus">
Lucius Cossonius Gallus

Lucius Cossonius Gallus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service. He was suffect consul in one of the "nundinia" that fell in the last half of AD 117 as the colleague of Publius Afranius Flavianus. His full name is Lucius Cossonius Gallus Vecillius Crispinus Mansuanius Marcellinus Numisius Sabinus. He is known entirely from inscriptions.
Career.
An inscription set up at Antioch of Pisidia has been assumed to refer to Gallus, although the name is incomplete: "[...]nius Gallus Vecillius Crispinus Mansuanius Marcellinus Numisius Sabinus". Some authorities, such as L. Petersen and Hans-Georg Pflaum, have denied this identification; however, others, such as Ronald Syme, advocate for it. His first known office was as a military tribune with the Legio XXI Rapax. This legion disappeared in the 90s: one theory is that it was disbanded as a result of its participation in the revolt of Lucius Antonius Saturninus in January 89; another theory holds that it was destroyed during Domitian's campaign against the Sarmatians in the 90s; a third theory is that the legion mutinied at the time of the uprising of the Praetorians against Nerva in the year 97, and was disbanded afterwards. Bernard Rémy prefers the first possibility, that the legion had dishonored itself, noting that the name of the legion has been excised from several inscriptions at Vindonissa, a common indication of damnatio memoriae.
Following his military commission, Gallus then was appointed one of the "tresviri capitalis", one of the four boards that form the "vigintiviri"; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This particular board, which supervised prisons and the execution of criminals, was the least prestigious of the "vigintiviri". Since he is one of the few senators of that time to have fulfilled his military duties before entering the "vigintiviri", Rémy suggests Gallus might have been commissioned an angusticlave tribune and received the laticlave soon after. His next post, as legate to the proconsular governor of Asia, supports this hypothesis; in any case it demonstrates that Gallus had powerful mentors assisting his career, for only five other examples are known of men serving as legates to proconsuls prior to holding the office of quaestor, which he served in the public province of Bithynia and Pontus. The traditional Republican magistracies of plebeian tribune and praetor followed.
Once he completed his term as praetor, Gallus was appointed to a series of imperial posts. First was curator of a network of Etruscan roads, which comprised the "Trajanae novae": the Viae Clodia, Cassia, Annia, and the Ciminia. This was followed by an appointment as "praefectus frumenti dandi" (the prefect responsible for the distribution of Rome's free grain dole). Then Gallus was commissioned as "legatus legionis" or commander of two Roman legions. The first was Legio I Italica, stationed at Novae on the Danube in the imperial province of Moesia Inferior. Next was Legio II Traiana Fortis, which was raised in the year 105 on the eve of Trajan's Dacian Wars. Senators rarely commanded more than one legion in their career; in compiling a list of all men known to have commanded two or more, Anthony Birley identified only thirty-three men. After completing his military service, the sortition awarded Gallus the province of Corsica and Sardinia; although Rémy dates his tenure in that province to either 114/115 or 115/116, Werner Eck dates it to the period 112/113. Upon returning to Rome, Gallus was admitted to the "sodales Flaviales", which at the time was still an important honor. Following this he was appointed governor to the imperial province of Galatia. It is clear Gallus followed Lucius Caesennius Sospes in this office, and thus held this office after the year 114, yet before he acceded to the consulate; Rémy suggests he was governor from 117 to 119, while Eck proposes from 116 to 119.
Gallus' life after he stepped down from the consulate was long considered a blank until the discovery in 2003 of a statue base at Caesarea Maritima that attests that he was governor of Judea, an office reserved for senators of the consular rank. His presence in Judea is noteworthy, for he would have reunited with his old unit, Legio II Traiana Fortis, which had been stationed in that province in the year 117.

The story follows a love triangle of a character named Amit Dalal and it explores his relationship with three ladies: Chandan, his mother; Rama, his wife and Saroj, his lover. Parikh employs the stream of consciousness in his narration. He has used motifs such as pipal tree and darkness. He has explored Oedipus complex in his character's relationships. The novel was particularly praised for its language.
He was associated with the experimental literary circles such as Re Math and Akanth Sabarmati. His one-act play "Choras Inda Ane Gol Kabaro" was included in a collection of five one-act plays "Make Believe" (1968) published by Re Math.

"Moksh" (1975) is his one-act plays collection.
"Man Chitarie" (2004) is his poetry collection awarded by Gujarat Sahitya Akademi.
He co-edited poetry journal "Shabda" with Ravji Patel.

San Domenico, Turin

The Church and Convent of Saint Dominic () is a Roman Catholic church located in the city of Turin, Italy. Throughout its history it has served as a church, as inquisition tribunal, and as a masonic lodge.
History.
The church was built during the first half of the 13th century by Dominican friars, in gothic style. The adjacent convent was built in 1260 by Father John of Turin, who also established a library within the complex, thus making Saint Dominic, at the time, one of the cultural centers of the city. Shortly afterwards, towards the end of the 13th century, Saint Dominic became the seat of the Inquisition Tribunal of Turin, sentencing approximately 80 heretics to capital punishment throughout its existence. The façade of the building was erected in 1334, and the bell tower in 1451. During the Black Death epidemic of Turin occurring in 1630, a steel grate was placed on the entrance of the church as to allow churchgoers to attend mass without entering the building itself. During the Napoleonic period, most of the relics and precious materials in the church went missing, and the building became the seat of a Masonic lodge. It is currently the only surviving gothic building in the city.

San Francisco Comfort Women Memorial

The San Francisco Comfort Women memorial is a monument dedicated to comfort women before and during World War II. It is built in remembrance of the girls and women that were sexually enslaved by the Imperial Japanese Army through deceit, coercion, and brutal force. The site is located near the Saint Mary's Square, at the crossroads of San Francisco Chinatown and the Financial District. The statue ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength", by sculptor Steven Whyte, is one of nine and the first sculpture placed in a major U.S. city to commemorate the comfort women.
In protest of the memorial, Hirofumi Yoshimura—the mayor of Osaka, Japan—dissolved the sister-city relationship between Osaka and San Francisco that was established in 1957.
"Column of Strength" statue.
The San Francisco Comfort Women memorial and its bronze, 10-foot-tall ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength" statue were unveiled on September 22, 2017. The memorial statue was designed by the Carmel-based sculptor Steven Whyte. It depicts three teen-age girls, with each being of a specific nationality—Chinese, Korean, and Philippine—and altogether representing the estimated 200,000 "comfort women" from countries across East and Southeast Asia that were occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. These three girls are cast in bronze, standing in a circle atop a pedestal and holding hands in a back-to-back posture. Standing next to the pedestal and gazing up at them is another bronze figure of a "halmoni" (Korean for grandmother). It bears a resemblance to the Korean human rights activist Kim Hak-Sun, who was a victim of the forced enslavement to the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII and the first woman in Korea to come forward publicly about her experiences as a comfort woman.
Steven Whyte.
Steven Whyte, the sculptor of the ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength" statue, is a British-American artist living in Carmel, California. His works also include a life-sized Jumbo the Elephant at Tufts University and a multi-sculptures monument entitled "National Salute to Bob Hope and the Military".
Whyte describes himself as "a figurative sculptor," with a strong emphasis on the creation of characters in his works. He has a preference in human form as the sculpture subject, and often works with live models when designing sculptures. For ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength", he found models from the Central Coast and designed the figures of the teen-age Chinese, Korean, and Philippine girls partially based on the models.
Whyte also describes himself as a "sculptor of people" who prioritizes "the emotional quality and impact of the sculpture" and intends for his work to become catalysts for public responses, interactions, and conversations. To make ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength" resonate with its audience emotionally, Whyte puts an emphasis on the girls’ strength and solidarity through their posture, and makes them look at viewers directly "in an almost accusatory way" and with "post-traumatic" stress and shock.
Whyte reflects on the Column of Strength statue that "this is a story that has been hidden for so long that if it serves a purpose —to make people look into history and learn from history a little more— then my work is done."
Development.
In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed the resolution to build a memorial dedicated to comfort women, under the push led by retired judges Lillian Sing and Julie Tang. According to District 1 Supervisor Eric Mar, the memorial is expected to serve as the starting point for education and healing process, with an aim to "keep the issue alive when some in Japan are trying to silence the issue."
The memorial is privately funded by the Comfort Women Justice Coalition and was established in cooperation with other community organizations and city agencies. The organization raised $205,000 to make and install the statue. In a double-blind competition, British-American artist Steven Whyte’s design was chosen from more than 30 submissions from all over the world by an expert jury of arts professionals, community organizers and citizens. Whyte was then tasked with sculpting the memorial piece. The sculpture was installed on September 22, 2017.
During the design process, the sensitivity of the controversial issue was taken into consideration and the statue was designed not to display any violence or brutality. The memorial statue was given the name "Women's Column of Strength", and represents the young girls and women taken from China, Korea, and the Philippines, as well as to bring awareness to the sex trafficking of women during wartime.
Controversy.
Despite the signing of an December 28, 2015 agreement between Japan and Korea, in which Japan made an apology to the wartime sex trafficking of women and $8.3 million compensating payment, the dispute over comfort women remains unresolved.
This is due to the different purpose of attending the agreement and a different view of the nature of this issue between the two groups, the Korean victims and Japan.
The victims’ core demand was for Japan to “painfully acknowledge its moral and legal responsibility,” but Japan uniformly and repeatedly stated that there is no legal responsibility, avoiding the fundamentals of the issue. The victims also demanded an irreversible apology from the Japanese government following the ‘Cabinet decision’, but again, Japan avoided the formalities. In addition, the apology was not directly delivered to the victims, leaving the sincerity question.
The victims agreed to receive 100 million won(approx. $89,686) each and 20 million won(approx. $17,937) for the dead as compensation. However, immediately after the agreement, Japan insisted that the nature of the money paid would “not be reparation based on any legal responsibility.” As the Korean government has not sought the victims’ opinion on the amount of money during the negotiation process and the fundamental problem, as well as the issue of “legal responsibility,” would not be resolved without Japan’s will to apologize, the majority of victims decided that they would not take any money other than in a form of compensation. 
Japan on the other hand rejects that it is responsible in the first place. Japan claims that the comfort women were recruited by Korean pimps doing business and that the Japanese Imperial Forces supervised, but were not the “pivot of operation” of the comfort stations.
In 2017, after the unveiling ceremony of ""Comfort Women" Column of Strength", and in light of San Francisco's recognition of the memorial and its statue, Hirofumi Yoshimura—the mayor of Osaka, Japan—protested and threatened to end the sisterhood between the two cities of Osaka and San Francisco.
According to the Japanese national newspaper "Asahi Shimbun," Yoshimura contended that the relationship between Osaka and San Francisco of trust was "completely destroyed" by the placement of the statue. He argued that the memorial was unnecessary because Japan has already made amends regarding the issue of comfort women. Yoshimura also made the objection that the comfort women statue unfairly singles out Japan for wartime atrocities.
He said that "I am in favor of activities to protect the dignity and human rights of women. However, if the purpose is to protect the human rights of women, I would suggest that some of the special attention currently being given to Japan’s ‘comfort women’ issue should be broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world." Yoshimura formally withdrew sister city status from San Francisco in October, 2018.
The installation of the San Francisco statue worried some Japanese-Americans who felt it stigmatized the community and offered only a one-sided account to the comfort women story. Retired California judge and current chairman of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition, Julie Tang, refuted this claim by stating the memorial statue tackles the issue of women's freedom from sexual violence, such as through rape and assault during wartime.

Focus (Arthur Blythe album)

Focus, is an album by saxophonist Arthur Blythe which was recorded in 2002 and released on the Savant label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow stated: " In grooves ranging from New Orleans to R&amp;B-ish, along with freer explorations, this is a continually colorful set of high-quality music". On All About Jazz, Jon Wagner noted: ""Focus" sounds like it could have been conceived and recorded by some of the new crop of "downtown" musicians. The spare instrumentation and simple, elegant compositions sound fresh, relevant and forward-looking. But there's also a patina of maturity and self-assuredness that sets "Focus" apart from rawer, more experimental downtown sounds. That's because the musicians - supported on some tracks by special guest William Tsilis on concert grand marimba - have arrived at their maturity and self-assuredness through decades of experimental efforts. They've spent careers redefining jazz, and the fruits of their labor result in music that is relaxed and understated, yet emotive and powerful".
In JazzTimes, David Franklin wrote: "The primary attribute that distinguishes Arthur Blythe’s "Focus" is its sound. First there’s Blythe’s unique alto tone. Room filling and reedy (you can almost hear the individual vibrations) and ornamented by a quick, rhythmic vibrato, Blythe’s muscular sound identifies him immediately. Then there’s the quartet’s unusual instrumentation: tuba in place of string bass and marimba instead of piano. This special combination of sonic properties sets the recording apart from many others offering a similar stylistic approach. For aside from the extra latitude Bob Stewart’s tuba affords him in generating imaginative bass lines, the playing is essentially mainstream and straightahead".

Psalis pennatula

Psalis pennatula, the yellow hairy caterpillar, is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793. It is found in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Australia and Java.
Description.
Its wingspan is about 40 mm. The forewings are coloured in two shades of brown divided by a line from the base to the wingtip. The anterior part is pale brown, whereas the posterior part is darker brown. Hindwings off white. Eggs are yellow and pubescent. The caterpillar is hairy with a broad black line along the back. There are four brown tussocks. Black line is bordered by yellow patches on each segment and each yellow patch having a red line through it. Two red glands found on the back of the two abdominal segments. There are two black hair-pencils found on the prothorax.
Biology.
The caterpillar is known to feed on many agriculturally important crops such as "Oryza sativa", "Sorghum bicolor", "Saccharum officinarum", "Imperata cylindrica", "Camellia sinensis", "Persea bombycina", "Shorea robusta", "Vigna mungo", "Solanum melongena", "Tectona grandis", "Triticum aestivum", "Cucumis sativus", "Eleusine coracana", "Hyparrhenia", "Cyperus" and "Pennisetum purpureum".
It is a minor pest on paddy, where the attack by caterpillar can result defoliation. Damage can be minimized by using light traps or using chlorpyrifos. A braconid parasitoid wasp "Microplitis pennatula" is known to induces rapid behavioral changes in the parasitized host, which is the caterpillar of "P. pennatula".

Zacaria Candao

Datu Zacaria A. Candao is a Filipino politician who served as the first governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
Career.
Maguindanao governor (until 1977).
Zacaria Candao became the second governor of the Maguindanao province succeeding Simeon A. Datumanong. He resigned on April 1, 1977. Sultan Kudarat Municipal Mayor Sanggacala M. Baraguir was appointed by then President Ferdinand Marcos to succeed Candao.
Events leading to the 1986 People Power Revolution.
During the 1986 Philippine presidential snap election, Candao supported the candidacy of Corazon Aquino as provincial chairman of the Maguindanao and Cotabato City chapter of the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, an opposition party which is against the administration of then-incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos. He linked the interests of Muslim Filipinos in the UNIDO platform and facilitated the defection of Filipino Muslim politicians who were part of Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, the ruling party, to UNIDO. Marcos contested win over the 1986 elections later led to his ouster in the People Power Revolution of February 1986 which saw Corazon Aquino installed as President of the Philippines.
Magundanao governor (1986–1990).
After the People Power Revolution, Candao was appointed as acting governor of Maguindanao on April 5, 1986 by then President Corazon Aquino. He was also the acting chairman of the Executive Council of the Regional Autonomous Government for Central Mindanao. Candao was elected as Maguindanao's governor in 1989, he later resigned to run as governor of the then-newly created Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and was succeeded by Vice Governor Norodin Matalam as Maguindanao governor.
As ARMM governor (1990–1993).
Candao participated in ARMM's first gubernatorial elections on February 12, 1990 and was elected as the autonomous region's first governor. He officially assumed the post months later on July 6, 1990. He vied for a second term in the 1993 March elections but lost to Lininding P. Pangandaman.
Maguindanao governor (1995–2001).
After being the ARMM regional governor, Candao ran again for the post of Governor of Maguindanao in 1995. He was successful and won re-election in 1998. He lost to Andal Ampatuan Sr. in the 2001 elections.
Embezzlement case.
The Sandiganbayan found Candao along his brother and executive secretary Abas Candao guilty of nine counts of malversation in October 2008 sentencing him to 162 years of prison (18 years per count) for embezzling of public funds. Then-state auditor Heidi Mendoza led a team that discovered the unlawful release of 52 checks from December 1992 to March 1993. Candao filed a motion for consideration before the Supreme Court on October 19, 2011 to reverse the guilty verdict. The high court however upheld the decision in early 2012 after it found "no compelling reason" for the petition.

Synagogue of Turin

The Synagogue of Turin (), also known as Israelite Temple (), is a place of worship located in the city of Turin, Italy.
History.
After regaining their civil rights in the Kingdom of Sardinia through the institution of the Albertine Statute in 1848, the Jewish community wished to build a synagogue in Turin, in order to establish their presence in the Kingdom's capital. In 1859 the community tasked architect Alessandro Antonelli to build what would be their future temple, and works started swiftly. In 1875 it became cleat that the architect's vision was beyond the scope, size, and budget of the community. For this reason, they chose to sell the half-completed building to the city in exchange for a sum of money and the land upon which the current-day synagogue stands. The building sold by the community would eventually become known as Mole Antonelliana. In 1880 architect Enrico Petiti started works for the present-day, moorish-style synagogue, which would be eventually completed in 1884.
On November 20, 1942, Allied bombardments on the city completely destroyed the synagogue, with the exception of the exterior walls. It would come to be rebuilt between 1945 and 1949 to its current status.

Rollin Motors

The Rollin Motors company was an American automobile manufacturer from 1923 until 1925 and founded by Rollin Henry White. The company was based in Cleveland, Ohio.
History.
The Rollin automobile had advanced technology, brakes on all four wheels (mechanical internal expanding type), pistons and connecting rods of special aluminum, lubrication oil through a pump and a four-bearing crankshaft.
There were four models: Touring ($995.00) , Brougham, Sedan and 3 passenger Coupe. Cars were sold in USA, Australia and a very few to Europe. 
Designed and built by Rollin H. White, formerly chief engineer of the White Motor Company.
The car was planned as an economical automobile to capture a share of the low price market. Its engine was similar to that of the Cletrac tractor, a White subsidiary. The chairman was Rollin Henry White. His father, Thomas White, was owner of The White Sewing Machine Company , White Steamer and the White Motor Company. 
The Rollin was too high-priced for the market for which it had been intended. In its most successful year, 1924, approximately 6,500 units were produced. By the end of 1925 the factory was closed due to bankruptcy. As of 2018, there are several Rollin automobiles in the USA and in Australia, as well as a few in Europe, at least one in the Netherlands and two in Sweden. 
In December 1924 the car carrier "SS Lakeland" transported on Lake Michigan several new automobiles. The "Lakeland" sank with at least twenty-two model-year vehicles aboard from Nash Motors, Kissel Motor Car Company, and Rollin motor company. Recreational divers recovered one Rollin automobile in 1979.

Night Song, is an album by saxophonist Arthur Blythe which was recorded in California in 1996 and released on the Clarity Recordings label the following year.
Reception.
In his review on Allmusic, Scott Yanow stated: "This is a particularly intriguing and enjoyable release ... Whether it be hints at New Orleans parade rhythms, Afro-Cuban jazz, older styles of jazz, or freer explorations, this is a fascinating set that is well worth several listens". In JazzTimes, Miles Jordan wrote: "This challenging CD finds Blythe doing most of the soloing with Stewart’s ebullient tuba primarily functioning as a walking bass. ... On the tunes that feature the percussionists-all playing hand drums-his marimbas definitely imbue them with a “world music” feeling".

Southern Rhodesia Act 1965

The Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 c. 76 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was designed to reaffirm British legal rule in Southern Rhodesia after Rhodesia had unilaterally declared independence. In practice, it only enforced the status of Southern Rhodesia as a British colony in British constitutional theory as the Rhodesian government did not recognise it.
History.
On 11 November 1965, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia Ian Smith declared Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the British Empire after the British Government refused to grant independence with White minority rule was still in place. Within five days, the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 had passed through Parliament and had received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II. The Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 stated that Southern Rhodesia was still legally a British colony and affirmed to the Queen the power to govern Southern Rhodesia via Orders in Council including amending the constitution and enforce legal restrictions upon them unilaterally.
Effect.
The first use of the Act was when the Queen issued an Order-in-Council to suspend the Southern Rhodesian Constitution and legally sacked the Rhodesian Front government. This gave formal effect to Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs dismissing the Rhodesian Front government within hours of the UDI, acting on orders from Whitehall. 
The Act was intended to show that the British Government alone had authority in Southern Rhodesia in theory. However, in practice, the act was largely ignored in Rhodesia and the government continued to meet as they considered that it was in violation of the constitutional convention that Westminster did not legislate for Southern Rhodesia. Additionally, it maintained that "in view of the new [Rhodesian] constitution" adopted as an annex to the UDI, the Crown's reserve power to sack the government no longer existed.
The Rhodesian Front government initially maintained allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. It attempted to reconstitute Rhodesia as a Commonwealth realm, recognising Elizabeth as Queen of Rhodesia. Prime Minister Ian Smith even went as far as advising the Queen to appoint a Governor-General as her representative in Rhodesia, acting on his claimed prerogatives as Her Majesty's Rhodesian Prime Minister. However, Queen Elizabeth II turned down this "purported advice." Ultimately, in 1970, Rhodesia unilaterally declared itself a republic after the Queen refused to recognise the title as illegal. In 1978, when Southern Rhodesia proposed an Internal Settlement to instigate black majority rule, the United Nations rejected it. The Act was repealed by the Zimbabwe Act 1979 after Rhodesia voluntarily returned to its former status as a British colony in order for multiracial elections and internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe.

Arbonne International

Arbonne International, LLC, known as Arbonne, is an international multi-level marketing company founded in 1980 in the United States by Norwegian entrepreneur Petter Mørck. Its product lines include vegan skincare, cosmetics, and nutrition. The company had an estimated annual sales revenue of $544 million in 2017. Arbonne's CEO is Jean-David Schwartz. Lawsuits have been filed concerning discrimination. In April 2020, Arbonne received a warning letter from the US Federal Trade Commission in response to illegal health claims related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as false and misleading income claims made by Arbonne distributors.
Arbonne is headquartered in Irvine, California, US, with international offices in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, and the United Kingdom.
History.
Founded in Orem, Utah, US by Mørck in 1980, Arbonne is named after a village in Switzerland, called Arbon. Mørck had worked in the Norwegian skincare industry from 1965. In 1975, feeling the ingredients used were harmful to the skin, he moved to Arbon, Switzerland and started working on his skincare line with Pierre Bottiglieri, an employee of Laboratoires Cosmetiques Arval. According to the history published by Arbonne, Bottiglieri and Mørck worked together to create a line of products using no petroleum or animal products. In another version of their history, Mørck purchased the formulations from Laboratoires Cosmetiques Arval, which sold formulations for rebranding. 
The first headquarters were located in Orem, Utah, moving to Irvine in 1984. Mørck was active in the company until his death in 2008. His son, Stian Mørck, is currently Brand Ambassador. Rita Davenport became the company's first President from 1991 to 2011. Arbonne became a subsidiary of Levlad, Inc., which became the main manufacturer of Arbonne products around 2004. In 2005, both companies were acquired by Harvest Partners, which dubbed the new acquisition Natural Products Group, LLC. In February 2018, Groupe Rocher, Paris, agreed to acquire Arbonne International and Nature's Gate from Natural Products Group.
The company made $200 million in sales in 2004. In 2005 there were 434,000 independent consultants, increasing to 612,000 in 2006. In 2006, Arbonne established distribution centers in Greenwood, Indiana, and near Calgary, Alberta. This was in addition to an existing distribution center in Mississauga, Ontario. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of the company's consultants fell from 1.3 million to under 800,000. In January 2010, Natural Products Group LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in order to reduce company debts. Harvest Partners were no longer involved, with Arbonne's new ownership being a combination of banks and private equity firms.
In 2006, Arbonne opened for business in Canada, then Australia in 2007, and the United Kingdom in 2008. In 2014, the company launched Arbonne Poland, and then both New Zealand and Taiwan in 2016. 
In March 2018, Arbonne was acquired by Groupe Rocher.
In January 2020, Arbonne announced its earned the B Corporation certificate. 
Products.
Products are formulated at the Arbonne Institute of Research and Development (AIRD) in Switzerland and produced in the United States. A 2006 article in "The Virginian-Pilot" highlighted questions about whether AIRD not having their own facilities was proper and noted that chemist Pierre Bottiglieri might have worked for multiple companies besides Arbonne. Bloomberg.com lists no address for the AIRD.
Business Model.
Arbonne is structured on a multi-level marketing model. The products are sold via home-based businesses owned and 
operated by independent consultants. Independent consultants are not employees and are viewed differently by the United States Internal Revenue Service. Arbonne is a member of the Direct Selling Association. 
In 2012, The Arbonne Charitable Foundation was registered as a charity to support programs to help teenagers build and increase their self-confidence. The Foundation has charitable status within the U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK.
Lawsuits.
In November 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana ruled that Arbonne International LLC violated federal law. The company refused to employ Lisa Wilson on the grounds of her disability (deafness). Arbonne paid a US$30,000 settlement to Wilson and was required to institute non-discrimination policies and training.
In May 2017, Cynthia and Michael Dagnall raised a lawsuit against Arbonne in the Orange County Superior Court. They alleged that the company was an illegal pyramid scheme. The Arbonne Pyramid Scheme Class Action Lawsuit was dismissed on March 20, 2018.
Recalls.
In January 2009, Arbonne voluntarily recalled some production lots of branded peanut butter cups. This was due to the risk of possible "Salmonella" serotype Typhimurium contamination of peanut-based products consigned from a Georgia processing plant.
In September 2009, Arbonne voluntarily recalled a production lot of branded foaming sea salt scrub, due to the risk of contamination with "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" bacteria.
In January 2013, Health Canada advised of Arbonne's voluntary recall of one batch of branded facial moisturizer for men. Arbonne's testing found that the batch contained the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. 
In January 2014, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) recalled sample tubes of branded day cream due to the presence of the bacterium "Enterobacter gergoviae".
In June 2016, Arbonne voluntarily recalled multiple lots of branded liquid eye liner. The products contained unacceptable levels of the bacteria "Staphylococcus saprophyticus", "Staphylococcus xylosus", and "Staphylococcus lentus".
In October 2017, the ACCC recalled one lot of branded body wash due to unacceptable levels of "Staphylococcus cohnii".

Max Taitz

Max Taitz (Max Arkadyevich Taitz, ; 1904-1980) was a scientist, an engineer, and one of the founders of Gromov Flight Research Institute (1941). He was a doctor of engineering, a professor, and a recipient of the Stalin Prize (1949 and 1953), and the honorary title of Honoured Scientist of the RSFSR (1961).
Biography.
Early years.
Taitz was born in Warsaw, Russian Empire. In 1915, the Taitz family escaped from the war to Moscow, where he and his younger brother studied at the Sokolov-Korobov private gymnasium (later Soviet secondary school No. 81). After leaving the gymnasium, he entered Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School. While he was a student, Taitz worked as a proofreader and a binder for a number of Moscow publishers. Closer to graduation, he worked as an aviation technician for the Soviet Air Force Research Institute (NII VVS) and began flight training in Sevastopol. In 1925, Taitz married Moscow State University student Iraida Zeest, who later became an archaeologist. Upon graduation from the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School in 1929, he was assigned to work for the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI).
Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI).
Taitz started work as a flight test engineer in the flight test section of the TsAGI under the supervision of Alexander Chesalov and Vsevolod Vedrov. His first job was flight testing of the TB-5 heavy bomber with Mikhail Gromov as a lead test pilot.
From 1934-1937, Taitz participated in a technical commission for engineering support of non-stop flight distance record flights of Valery Chkalov and Mikhail Gromov in the Tupolev ANT-25 long-haul aeroplane and upon successful completion was awarded his first Order of Red Banner of Labour (1937). He was one of the authors of the comprehensive "Aircraft designer reference book" published by TsAGI in 1937. He was also involved in engineering support of Sigizmund Levanevsky's record flights from Moscow over the North Pole to the US.
After the arrest of his elder brother David Taitz in the Great Purge in 1938, Taitz left TsAGI and worked as engineer-editor for the State Scientific Library of the NKTP, editing the aviation department of the "News of Technical Literature" journal. In 1939, he got a chance to obtain the position of Dean of Theoretical Mechanics Department at the Soviet Union Industrial Academy but in 1940, a delegation from TsAGI visited him and requested his return to the institute to head a group of researchers.
Flight Research Institute.
Together with Alexander Chesalov and Vsevolod Vedrov, and with the support of Mikhail Gromov and Ivan Petrov, Taitz arranged the establishment of the Institute of Flight Research (8 March 1941). In the new institute Taitz held the Chief of Laboratory No. 2 position and also acted as the institute Deputy Chief for science. During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Taitz headed the evacuation of the science core of the institute to Novosibirsk, and supervised flight and ground testing of the serial production fighter aeroplanes to eliminate defects in the flight qualities and war-fighting capabilities of the aircraft. At the same time he took the lead in developing the second volume of the "Aircraft Designers Handbook" (RDK) devoted to flight test techniques and published by TsAGI in 1944. The same year Taitz was assigned to head a Soviet technical group for the evaluation of the Peenemünde test site where the German V-1 and V-2 missiles were tested.
From 1945 to 1947, together with Alexander Chesalov, Taitz initiated the development of testbed aeroplanes based on the Tu-2 bomber for flight testing of the jet engines. Concurrently he developed the theory of similarity for aviation turbojet engine testing. Taitz organised and supervised the flight research and testing of the first Soviet jet fighters MiG-9, MiG-15, MiG-19 and Su-9, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949.
At the end of 1940s during a second wave of antisemitism, Taitz and many others were fired from the institute. Later, in conjunction with new research projects in unmanned aircraft and missiles, and the establishment in 1952 of a new dedicated division, he was asked to return to the institute. After his return, he played a major role in the development and flight tests of Soviet cruise missiles the KS-1 and others, and their automatic control systems. In 1956, chief of the institute Nickolay Stroyev, insisted Taitz be assigned his deputy, although a number of high-level officials of the aviation industry were against that due to Taitz's Jewish ethnicity, his reluctance to be a Communist Party member and his repressed or emigrated relatives.
In the late 1960s, Taitz initiated the development of the USSR civil aircraft certification system and was a strong supporter of joining the USSR to the Chicago convention and ICAO. Gromov Flight Research Institute became a leading research organisation in the USSR in flight testing and certification of aircraft and Taitz was a driving force behind that. Other notable scientists in these activities were Nickolay Stroyev, Victor Utkin, and Arseny Mironov. For a number of years in the 1960s, Taitz was head of the Soviet-French working group on avionics and flight tests. He was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1966 for achievements in automation of aeroplane controls.
Universities.
At different times Taitz was a professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow State Aviation Technological University (1940–1941) and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (1938–1940 and 1955–1980). From 1965–1974 he was head of the Aerophysical and Flight Research Department within the Aeromechanics and Flight Engineering Faculty of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
Family.
Taitz was born to Izhok-Aaron (Isaac-Arkady) Z. Taitz () (1868–1935), a travelling salesman who was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, Russian Empire, and Sara (Sophia) M. Vilenchuk () (1874–1951), who was born in a suburb of Kaunas.
In 1925 Taitz married Iraida B. Zeest () (1902–1981), who was born in Saint Petersburg. She studied at Moscow State University and graduated from the Faculty of Philology, with a Doctor of Science in History degree. She worked for the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts and later for the Institute of Archaeology, USSR Academy of Sciences. They had two daughters; Irina M. Khmelevskaya Taitz () (born 1932) and Elena M. Flokovskaya Taitz () (born 1940).
Memorials.
Taitz is buried at the Bykovskoye Memorial Cemetery in Zhukovsky. There is a bronze memorial plate with his bas-relief image installed on the Gromov Flight Research Institute headquarters building where he once worked.
Notable publications.
Most of Taitz's notable publications are in Russian.

Shapurgala

Shapurgala () is a fortress located on the left bank of Nakhchivanay, near the village with the same name in Shahbuz District of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.
Research.
The fortress is located on a high mountain, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was registered as an archeological monument in 1990. The area of the fortress is 1,300 m2. There is a Pir on the road to the fortress. In the area above the Pir, remains of a destroyed construction and pink colored clay dish fragments were encountered.
In the central part of the fortress researchers came across construction remnants, baked bricks, pink clay plates and remains of grain stones and fireplaces. The findings indicate that life in Shapurgala lasted from the first century AD to the XV-XVI centuries. It was also used as a guard station for defensive purposes.
Architectural features.
The fortress is located in a polygonal-shaped area. The tallest place of the pitch is the tallest cliff in the south-east. Inside the cliff a rectangular room is drilled with 4x3.6 m of area. The burnt bricks of the size of 19x19x5 cm were found inside the room, a rhomb shaped niche was made on the wall of the fortress, and the wall under the niche was made in semi-circular form.

Blue Brigade (military unit)

The Blue Regiment or the Blue Brigade was an infantry regiment in the service of Gustav II Adolph during his campaigns in Germany in the Thirty Years' War. A large portion of the regiment was made up of German mercenaries, who were a common phenomenon on both sides. The regiment's name is derived from the blue colored uniforms worn by the soldiers.
The regiment was raised around 1624 during the Polish–Swedish War of 1621–25, originally recruited from Swedish provinces. Following the landing of Gustavus Adolphus and his army in Pomerania, new recruits came from local German inhabitants to fill the ranks. From 1630 onward, the Blue regiment took part in almost every battle of the Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War, such as the battle of Breitenfeld (1631), Lützen (1632) and Nördlingen (1634). Battle of Lützen in particular, where it is referred to as the "Old Blue" regiment, though this name was official from 1634 only, was disastrous to the regiment as it lost more than half of its veteran soldiers from the recurring attacks of the Imperial cavalry and the heavy enemy volleys.
Term brigade is derived from a Swedish infantry formation called the "Swedish Brigade", which was developed by Gustavus Adolphus during his military reforms. Normally, a brigade would be composed of 2 regiments divided into 4 or 3 squadrons of c. 400 men each, though in some cases, a double sized regiment of around 16 or more companies was able to form a brigade on its own, as it was later with the Blue and Yellow regiments.
The regiment was dissolved around 1650 with other colored regiments dissolved around 1638 or before. It was later resurrected as the Göta Life Guards, which was dissolved in 1980.

St Catherine's Church, Canton

St Catherine's Church, Canton is a listed Anglican church which serves the areas of Canton and Riverside in Cardiff, Wales.
Originally a small hamlet in the parish of Llandaff, separate from Cardiff, Canton had seen drastic urbanisation and expansion as Cardiff industrialised during the 19th Century. The church of St John the Evangelist had already been established in the 1850s, but as the area continued to grow, further places of worship were needed, even after St Johns had been enlarged in 1870. The first rector of St John's, the Reverend Vincent Saulez, founded St Catherine's in the early 1880s and later also founded St Paul's in Grangetown.
The founding stone of St Catherine's was laid by Catherine Vaughan, the wife of the Dean of Llandaff. She also contributed £1000 towards the building. It has been speculated that the church's name was influenced by this generosity. The plans of diocesan architect John Prichard had intended a cruciform design, but this proved overambitious, and Prichard built only three bays of the nave. The church opened in 1885 before Prichard had finished the project, and his death in 1886 caused the work to pause. It was later completed in two stages: first by Kempson &amp; Fowler in 1892-3, who added the chancel, south chapel and north vestry. In 1897, G.E. Halliday added two bays at the west end. The church has a marble reredos and stained glass windows by Ninian Comper.
St Catherine's became a separate parish in 1895, but in the 20th Century, this was merged with St John's. It is now in the Rectorial Benefice of Canton, together with St John's and St Luke's. The church has been listed since 1975.

Lachaise's climbing mouse

Lachaise's climbing mouse ("Dendromus lachaisei") is a species of climbing mouse described by Denys and Aniskine in 2012. First discovered on the slopes of Mount Nimba, it is now believed that the species is extant within Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire.
Description.
The Lachaise's climbing mouse measures between 5.5 and 7.7 centimetres in body length, with a tail length of between 7.9 and 9.8 centimetres. The upper section of the body is light brown, while the chest and stomach are whitish in colour. The species are distinguished from close relatives through the absence of a black stripe on the back, a lack of white spot on the muzzle, the presence of an additional toe, and cranial differences.
Distribution and habitat.
Specimens caught to date have been located within the boundaries of the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which overlaps the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire. The mouse tends to frequent montane savannah plains, lowland and montane tropical forest and cultivated banana and quinine plantations.
Threats.
The species may be under direct threat from mining activity and human movement. Due to the location in regard to the border of Guinea, Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, the locality is prone to extensive refugee movement. The area is additionally mined on the basis of iron ore concessions, posing a threat to the habitat of the mouse. These prevalent risks have relatively recently seen the area added to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The former countries place protections upon the reserve, but the status of conservation regarding Cote d’Ivoire remains unknown.

2018 Santosh Trophy Final

The 2018 Santosh Trophy Final was a match between Kerala and West Bengal, played on 1 April 2018, at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata, West Bengal. The match was a culmination of the 2017–18 Santosh Trophy, the 72nd edition of the football competition contested by regional state associations and government institutions under the All India Football Federation. Kerala won the match after defeating West Bengal in a penalty shootout 4–2. In regulation time, the match ended 1–1 while during extra time, a goal each found both sides tied 2–2 after 120 minutes.
Kerala entered this edition of the Santosh Trophy after qualifying from Group B of the South Zone qualifiers. West Bengal entered after qualifying from Group B of the East Zone qualifiers. Prior to the start of the competition proper, both Kerala and West Bengal were placed in Group A for the first round. Both sides faced each other in the final match of the round, both winning their previous three matches. Kerala came away as the 1–0 winners to win the group.
West Bengal entered the match as the defending champions after winning the Santosh Trophy the previous year in 2017.
Road to the final.
The Santosh Trophy is an association football knock-out competition contested by the regional state associations and government institutions under the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the sport's governing body in India. Started in 1941, the competition was considered the top domestic football championship in India, prior to the start of the National Football League in 1996. The 2017–18 competition is the 72nd edition of the Santosh Trophy.
In order to enter the competition proper, teams had to go through a qualification round based on their region. Kerala were placed in Group B of the South Zone qualifiers while West Bengal were placed in Group B of the East Zone qualifiers. Kerala topped their group consisting of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to qualify. West Bengal would also top their group consisting of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.
Kerala.
Prior to reaching the 2018 final, Kerala had played the final of the Santosh Trophy 13 times, winning on five occasions, most recently in 2004. For this edition of the tournament, Kerala were placed in Group A with Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Manipur, and eventually final opponent West Bengal.
Kerala's first match of the competition occurred on 19 March against Chandigarh. A brace from Jithin M.S. and three goals from Sajith Poulose, Afdal V.K. and Sreekuttan V.S. respectively earned Kerala an opening 5–1 victory. Four days later, Kerala defeated Manipur 6–0. Jithin Gopalan scored a brace while Afdal V.K., Rahul K.P., and Jithin M.S. scored the other three goals. The sixth goal came from an own goal by Roshan Singh. Two days later, on 25 March, Kerala would earn another major victory, 3–0 over Maharashtra. Rahul Raj opened the scoring in the 24th minute before Jithin M.S. scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the 39th. Rahul K.P. scored Kerala's third in the 58th minute. Finally, on 27 March, Kerala played their final match of the group stage against eventually final opponent West Bengal. Rahul K.P. scored his third goal of the tournament in the 90th minute to give Kerala the victory and top of the group.
With the group stage finished, Kerala would take on Mizoram in the knockout semi-final match at the Mohun Bagan Ground. An Afdal V.K. goal in the 54th minute was enough to give Kerala the victory and a spot in their 14th final.
West Bengal.
West Bengal is entering this final as the most winningest team in competition history, winning the competition 32 times, including the final from the previous year. As well as their 32 championships, West Bengal were runners-up in the tournament 12 times. The second most winningest side in the competition is Punjab, with eight championships.
For this edition of the Santosh Trophy, West Bengal were placed in Group A alongside Chandigarh, Maharashtra, Manipur, and their finals opponent, Kerala. Their match was against Manipur on 19 March at the Sailen Manna Stadium. A Sumit Das brace and a goal from Bidyasagar Singh gave West Bengal a comfortable 3–0 opening victory. Two days later, West Bengal took on Maharashtra and won 5–1. Maharashtra took the lead early in the 8th minute through Leander Dharmai. West Bengal came back in the second half and equalized through Manotosh Chakladar in the 55th minute. Jiten Mumru then gave West Bengal the lead in the 62nd minute before Bidyashagar Singh scored their third in the 79th minute. The scoring was rounded off by a Bidyashagar Singh goal for a brace and Rajon Barman.
Then, on 25 March, Bidyashagar Singh scored his third goal of the tournament as West Bengal defeated Chandigarh 1–0. Despite the victory, West Bengal head coach, Ranjan Chowdhury, was displeased with his team's performance: "I’m not at all happy with the team’s performance. We probably played the worst match of the tournament today." Two days later, West Bengal succumbed to their first defeat of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat against their finals opponent Kerala.
After the group stage, with West Bengal finishing second in Group A, the side were to play Group B winners Karnataka on 30 March. During the match, West Bengal captain Jiten Murmu opened the scoring in the 57th minute before Tirthankar Sarkar secured the victory for West Bengal in the 92nd minute and sent his side to their 45th final.
Pre-match.
Host selection.
On 21 February 2018, it was announced by the All India Football Federation that the Santosh Trophy would take place in Kolkata. Prior to the beginning of the tournament, Kushal Das, the AIFF's General Secretary, said that he was looking forward to the Indian Football Association (West Bengal's state football federation) successfully hosting the competition.
Before the final, during the tournament, three different stadiums were used in and around Kolkata. The Rabindra Sarobar Stadium and the Sailen Manna Stadium were extensively used throughout the group stage before the Mohun Bagan Ground hosted some matches towards the end of the group stage and during the semi-finals. For the final of the competition, the match will be played at the Salt Lake Stadium.
Analysis.
Despite taking the victory in their prior match during the group stage, Kerala will not come into this match as favorites. Due to being hosts in the final and history, West Bengal are favorites. Previously, both Kerala and West Bengal have met in the final of the Santosh Trophy twice, back in 1989 and 1994. On both occasions, West Bengal came out as the winners in penalty shootouts. However, even with history not on Kerala's side, their head coach, Satheevan Balan, was optimistic before the final: "We know the statistics. But that is not something we are concerned about. Stats have been against us since the start of the tournament. We were not fancied when we started the campaign and many doubted us to even make it past the qualifiers. But now we are in the final. We have considered every game as a final since arriving here and on Sunday, it will be the same."
For West Bengal, the hosts will be looking to reverse their defeat to Kerala from the group stage. "There is no pressure. The team has confidence in its ability to win the final,” said Bengal head coach Ranjan Chowdhury. “They are organised and strong defensively. Whoever wins needs to earn the trophy by playing well." West Bengal will also enter the match still as reigning champions, after they won in the final the previous season against Goa 1–0. For Kerala, this will be their first final appearance since 2013 and their first attempt to win the trophy since 2004. "We can create history as it was 14 years ago that Kerala last won the prestigious trophy, but we will play without pressure," said head coach, Satheevan Balan.
Coming into the match, West Bengal had the league's best defense, only conceding twice throughout the tournament while Kerala have scored the most goals during the competition.

<doc id="56792315" url="?curid=56792315" title="Flag of the British South Africa Company">
Flag of the British South Africa Company

The Flag of the British South Africa Company was the flag used by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) and Rhodesia under company rule. It was adopted in 1892 and was used until 1923 when the south of Rhodesia voted to become Southern Rhodesia and the north was surrendered to the Colonial Office to become Northern Rhodesia. The flag remained as the Company's commercial flag until 1965. The flag consisted of a British Union Flag with the Company's logo of a lion and tusk on a white circle in the centre with "B.S.A.C." underneath it.
History.
The British South Africa Company headed by Cecil Rhodes received a royal charter from Queen Victoria to create a new British colony in Africa. The Pioneer Column of the BSAC set out and founded Salisbury in 1890. The BSAC flag they had ordered to be made did not reach South Africa from England in time before the column set off. As a result, the Union Flag was raised instead, although it had been suggested that they use a white flag with the letters "BSACo" on it. The BSAC flag eventually arrived in the newly-established Rhodesia in 1892 and was first raised over Fort Salisbury. In 1893, it was raised over Bulawayo, following the Company's conquest of the Matabeleland.
In 1922, Rhodesian voters voted in the Southern Rhodesian government referendum, 1922 for responsible government independent of the BSAC ahead of joining the Union of South Africa. Remaining under BSAC control was considered but was eventually not included in the final ballot. As such, the BSAC flag was lowered on 29 September 1923 by the British South Africa Police when the colony's new status as Southern Rhodesia came into being with the Union Flag becoming the only official flag. However, it is speculated that it was retained by the Governor of Southern Rhodesia as the governor's flag until around 1931. The same happened in what would become Northern Rhodesia where the BSAC surrendered its role in the colony to the Colonial Office via an order in council from His Majesty's Privy Council. Despite the flag losing its status as a colonial flag, the BSAC flag continued to be used by the British South Africa Company as their private company flag and they would fly it over their offices in London and in the Rhodesias. This situation continued until 1965 when the British South Africa Company merged with the Anglo-American Corporation.
Anomalies.
As the British South Africa Company flag had no formal description or definition in the Royal charter, the design of the flag is not standardised. The most common discussion was if there was a red ring around the white disk. Versions of the flag held by the National Archives of Zimbabwe (including the final flag that flew over the Magistrates Court in Bulawayo) do not have the ring on it. But versions held by the British National Army Museum and Livingstone Museum in Zambia do. It was reported the version with red ring was used since 1889, and the version without ring began to use in 1893. There were also discussions as to if the flag had red or blue ensigns based upon it. Though ensigns based on the flag do appear on flag charts, it is speculated they were never used as Rhodesia did not border the sea.

Bridport Museum

Bridport Museum is a museum in Bridport, Dorset, England. It is housed within an early 16th century building known as the Castle, located on South Street. The building has been Grade II* Listed since 1950.
History.
The Bridport Museum and Art Gallery was established in 1932 by Captain Alfred Percy Codd, who had purchased the Castle for £1,800 the year before. He offered to donate the building to Bridport Borough Council on the condition that it would be transformed into a museum and art gallery, which would house his own paintings. The council accepted Codd's offer and the museum opened on 28 May 1932.
In 1974, the management of the museum was taken over by West Dorset District Council, and later in 2002 by the Bridport Museum Trust. After years of planning, the museum closed to undergo a £1.3 million redevelopment in 2016. Funding had been received from various sources, including the Heritage Lottery Fund, Bridport Town Council, West Dorset District Council and public donation. It reopened in May 2017 with new galleries and displays, while repair work had been completed on the building.

Luigi Alberto Bianchi

Luigi Alberto Bianchi (1 January 1945 – 3 January 2018) was an Italian violinist and violist.
Life.
Bianchi was born in 1945 in Rimini, into a musical family, and from the age of six he had violin lessons.
The violin classes being oversubscribed at a music college in Rome, he instead studied viola; he later studied at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia with the violist Renzo Sabatini. Sabatini arranged an audition with Yehudi Menuhin, who invited him to play at the Bath International Music Festival in 1968, and involved him in other music projects.
For eight years Bianchi was a member of the Quartetto di Roma piano quartet, and he was principal viola at the Orchestra Sinfonica della RAI in Rome. He won the Carl Flesch competition in 1970, playing Walton's Viola Concerto in the presence of the composer. In 1973 he was appointed Professor of Viola at the University of Milan.
In 1980 his Amati viola, of 1595, known as the "Medicea" was stolen from his car in Milan. (It was recovered in 2006.) Unable to find another viola that he liked, his subsequent career was as a violinist. He bought a Stradivarius violin of 1692, and later the 1716 "Colossus" Stradivarius. In 1998 this was stolen (and remains missing); he then performed on both violin and viola.
He made recordings of music for violin and viola, sometimes both on the same disc. Recordings include Paganini's "Sonata per la Grand Viola", Max Reger's three suites for viola, Sarasate's Spanish Dances Op. 23, and works by Nino Rota.
Bianchi taught in Europe and the US, and conducted. He was an authority on Paganini, and wrote a book about Paganini's teacher Alessandro Rolla.

Lord Theobald Butler

Lord Theobald Butler (24 August 1852 – 16 June 1929) was a British clergyman who was the youngest son of John Butler, 2nd Marquess of Ormonde and his wife, Frances Jane Paget. At the time of his birth, he was the fourth son of Lord and Lady Ormonde, and he was christened James Theobald Bagot John Butler. As a younger son of a marquess, he received the honorific prefix of Lord from birth.
He is historically significant as being one of the last male members of the ancient House of Ormonde (see Earl of Ormond). He was the brother of James Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde and Arthur Butler, 4th Marquess of Ormonde, the uncle of George Butler, 5th Marquess of Ormonde and Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde, and the father of Charles Butler, 7th Marquess of Ormonde.
Life and marriage.
He attended Cambridge University and was the Rector of Ulcombe, Kent, from 1898 to 1923. In 1919, he was made the beneficiary of a £275 annual charge on the Ormonde Estates in the will of his eldest brother, James Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde.
He married Annabella Gordon, daughter of clergyman Dr Cosmo Reid Gordon, and had five children:

Marilyn Fain Apseloff

Marilyn Fain Apseloff (March 18, 1934 - February 22, 2018) was an American author and a professor at Kent State University, known for her study of children's literature.
Early life and education.
Apseloff was born Marilyn Fain in 1934 in Attleboro, Massachusetts to Arthur and Eve Fain. Apseloff received her bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1956, and her master's degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1957. She also completed a fellowship at the University of Cincinnati in 1957. Her formal introduction to children's literature began when her husband urged her to take a class at Kent State University, where he taught.
Career.
Apseloff became a teaching assistant for the Children's Literature class at Kent State, then a part-time instructor in 1969.  After promotions to Assistant and Associate Professor in the English department, she became a full Professor in 1992.
Apseloff was among the early leadership of the Children's Literature Association (ChLA), founded in 1973 to provide a professional hub for scholarly study and criticism of children's literature, a field at that time in its infancy. She served on the association's board of directors from 1976 to 1985, as treasurer from 1976 to 1977, and president from 1979 to 1980. She was the chair of the organization's conference at Harvard University in 1979.
Apseloff attended the 1979 First White House Conference on Library and Information Services as the president of the Children's Literature Association and spoke before a Senate committee. She also presented a paper on the importance of child-specific services and literature, and the work the ChLA was doing in these areas.
Her writings discuss and analyze literature ranging from books for babies to adult poetry for children, and she wrote about controversial subjects in children's literature, including death, abandonment, war, and suicide. She also wrote analysis of children's novels and biographical essays about authors.
During her career, Apseloff served as a contributing editor of the "Children’s Literature Quarterly" from 1979-1982, then as a co-editor in 1983, and as an editor from 1984-1987. She taught and presented her work both nationally and internationally, including in Greece, Poland, and Lithuania. She also contributed her time to the Kent Free Public Library and local schools.
Much of Apseloff's scholarly writing concerned absurdist and nonsense literature for children. With Celia Catlett Anderson, she wrote "Nonsense Literature for Children: Aesop to Seuss", which was chosen as a Book Award Honorable Mention by the Children's Literature Association in 1991. The book received positive reviews in both "The School Library Journal", and the journal "Emergency Librarian", and along with related articles continues to be cited by scholars who are extending knowledge in the field of children's literary criticism and those studying the works of Theodor Geisel, Lewis Carroll, and Edward Gorey.
Apseloff also studied the writings of authors whose primary audience is adults but who also created books for children, and works for adults that could be adapted for children. In addition to a number of articles on this topic, Apseloff wrote the book "They Wrote for Children Too: An Annotated Bibliography of Children's Books by Famous Writers for Adults".
Apseloff's third book, "Elizabeth George Speare", published in 1991, focused on the American writer and Newbery Medal winner's works for children, including "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" and "The Sign of the Beaver".
Apseloff contributed articles entitled "Literature for Children" to the "World Book Year Book" every year from 1984 through 2004.

Ardvreck Group

The Ardvreck Group is a stratigraphic group of early Cambrian age found in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland.

Ham Fen

Ham Fen is a nature reserve south of Sandwich in Kent. It is one of Kent Wildlife Trust's nature reserves and is being extended in 2018 by an extra 33 acres.
This old fenland site has wet grassland with deep mires, dykes and ditches, and is the last surviving ancient fen habitat in Kent. The reserve was established in 1991 and as of mid-2018 covers over 100 acres. Considerable damage was caused by two major episodes of land drainage in the 18th century and early 1980s, which led to significant habitat deterioration and loss of wetland species.
Work to repair the natural environment includes the successful reintroduction of beavers to the site, which first took place in 2002.
The site is not open to the public.

Ortonville Mill

The Ortonville Mill is a former gristmill located at 366 Mill Street in Ortonville, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The Ortonville Community Historical Society now operates the mill as a museum of local history.
History.
Amos Orton was born in 1809 in Hadley, New York. In about 1848 he arrived in Oakland County, Michigan and constructed a sawmill very near this location. In 1852, he constructed a gristmill nearby to make the location more attractive to potential settlers. In 1856, he replaced the gristmill with the current structure. The small community of Ortonville grew up around the milling center, with Amos Orton working as the miller, blacksmith, and keeping a general store.
Orton gave up his mill in 1860, but it continued to thrive under a variety of owners well into the twentieth century. In 1889, the mill was converted to the roller process, and for a time during the 1920s also generated electric power for the community. The mill continued in use until 1960 In 1968, Emiline and Jack Hamilton donated the Mill to the Ortonville Community Historical Society for use as a museum of local history. The Society now owns and maintains the mill as a museum and gathering place.
Description.
The Ortonville Mill is a 2-1/2 story Greek Revival structure, made with a hand-hewn timber frame and sitting on an unpaved basement. The original section of the mill measures 36 feet by 48 feet; at some early point a large room was added on bringing the total length to 108 feet. Most of the original windows are nine over six sliding sash units. A roofed loading dock has been added to one side of the building.

Willem Ravelli

Willem Ravelli (31 May 1892 – 21 September 1980) was a Dutch classical bass-baritone and an academic voice teacher. After a short operatic career with De Nederlandse Opera, he worked mostly in concert, singing "Lieder" and oratorios. He is known for as the voice of Christ in Bach's "St Matthew Passion", which he performed more than 400 times, including the first recording of the work.
Career.
Born Willem Albert Felix Ravelli in The Hague, Ravelli studied voice with Frans Andreolie and Cornélie van Zanten, then at the conservatory in his home town in the opera class of Anton Sistermans.
Ravelli was a member of the De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam from the 1922/23 season. He appeared in many supporting roles, such as Morales in Bizet's "Carmen" and Alcindor in Puccini's "La bohème", and in 1927 as Wolfram in Wagner's "Tannhäuser".
He focused on concert singing, succeeding Thomas Denijs as the vox Christi in the regular performances of Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" conducted by Willem Mengelberg. He sang the role in the first recording of the work in 1939, with the and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, alongside Karl Erb as the Evangelist. A reviewer of a reissue of the performance which was shortened as customary at the time of the recording, notes in 2004: "As Jesus the Dutch bass Willem Ravelli can be a mite gruff but he's also a spiritually intense presence and right inside the role, one incidentally he performed over four hundred times."
Ravelli also appeared in Belgium, England and Germany, presenting a broad repertory including the bass part in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He recorded the symphony in 1940, again with Mengelberg, the Toonkunstkoor and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, and the Royal Oratorio Society.

Florence Dissent

Florence Dissent, known later as Mrs. Dissent Barnes, (born July 9, 1869) was an Anglo-Indian medical practitioner and surgeon. Dissent was among the first female Indian doctors to practice medicine. 
Early life and education.
Dissent was born in Calcutta, India. She was educated at home until the age of eight. She then became a day-pupil at Loreto Convent, where she stayed until the age of 14.
Dissent received her doctor of medicine (MD) from Brussels. She was licensed through the Triple Qualification from the Scottish medical and surgical colleges: the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.
Medical career.
After qualifying in medicine, Dissent worked at the Dufferin Hospital in Allahbad under a Dr. McConaghey. The Dufferin staff, in 1892, consisted of Dissent, two male European surgeons, ten nurses, a midwife, a dresser, a compounder, and a matron. Dissent was attached to the Dufferin Fund and later the Women's Medical Service for India.
Dissent's work was published at least three times during her career. In 1891,the "Indian Medical Gazette" published a gynecological case study from her practice at Allahbad"." In that study, Dissent describes two cases of uterine polyps in her patients, detailing the medical history, symptoms, and treatments of each patient. In 1892, Dissent's notes on the Dufferin Hospital were published in "Indian Medical Gazette." Here, it was noted that Dissent herself performed 30 major operations from January to August 1892, ranging from cataract operations to obstetrics and gynecology and plastics. In the same time, Dufferin Hospital saw more than 100 minor cases per month. In these publications, Dissent's title is 'Miss' because she practiced as a surgeon. Throughout her career, Florence published under both Miss Dissent and Mrs. Dissent Barnes. 
In 1895, the "Indian Medical Record" published a full-page biographical sketch of Dissent. She was held up as a role model to encourage women to enter medicine. The article implored Indian woman to become medical practitioners particularly for the sake of treating the zenanas, who could not be seen by male doctors.
By 1912, Dissent had married and moved to Bhopal, India. In February of 1912, Dissent, now known as Mrs. Dissent Barnes, was visited by Sidney and Beatrice Webb during their travels. The Webbs noted the prevalence of syphilis in the area and were taken to see Dissent's hospital, which treated only women and children. Dissent had also been charged by the Begum of Bhopal, Sultan Jahan, to train the native midwives. These midwives ("dais") were prevented from practicing if they had not taken a course by Dissent or if they had been suspended by her.
In 1922, Dissent was employed to the Government of Bombay to inquire into the maternity conditions of industrial women workers. A year later, her report on the subject was published in the "Bombay Labour Gazette".

Female Political Union of the Working Classes

The Female Political Union of the Working Classes was established in 1833 by Mary Fildes and Mrs Broadhurst.
The organisation sprang from the wider labour movements of the early 19th century, influenced by Chartism and campaigns for women's enfranchisement. Fildes, who had been present at the Peterloo Massacre, had previously been president of the Manchester-based Society of Female Reformers (itself a response to Blackburn Female Reform Society).
Little is currently known of the workings of many of these societies, but they are evidence of a highly organised and committed group of working class activist women, at a time when culturally such participation was socially discouraged. Katrina Navickas writes about groups like those set up by Fildes that 'Northern working-class women challenged the middle-class notion of separate spheres not simply by entering the political public sphere, but conversely by asserting domestic concerns as public and political.'

Fourth Merkel cabinet

The Fourth Merkel cabinet (German: "Kabinett Merkel IV") is the 23rd and current Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, sworn in on 14 March 2018 after Angela Merkel was proposed as Chancellor by Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and elected by the Bundestag on the first ballot.
The government is supported by a coalition of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), as was its immediate predecessor. Olaf Scholz (SPD) replaced Sigmar Gabriel as Vice Chancellor and CSU Leader Horst Seehofer became Federal Minister of the Interior, Building and Community.
The cabinet will officially be dismissed on 26 October 2021 with the first sitting of the newly elected 20th Bundestag, but will stay in office as acting cabinet, until a new chancellor is elected. The previous Merkel III government had to stay on as "acting" government past the end of the year 2017 in which the elections that were supposed to replace it were held. Merkel could become the longest serving chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (beating Helmut Kohl) if she were to stay in office past December 17, 2021.
Composition.
The cabinet consists of Chancellor Angela Merkel and fifteen (fourteen since 20 May 2021) federal ministers. Fourteen ministers head a department (since 20 May 2021, one minister heads two departments); one member of the cabinet, the Head of the Chancellery, is Federal Minister for Special Affairs without a portfolio. The CDU has seven positions, the SPD has six and the CSU has three, as follows:
2018 government crisis.
In June 2018, a government crisis erupted within the cabinet between Interior Minister and CSU Chairman Horst Seehofer and Chancellor Angela Merkel, after Seehofer had elaborated a masterplan on asylum policies, containing the rejection of asylum seekers already registered in other EU countries. Seehofer threatened to resign over the crisis on 1 July, but an agreement was made between the CDU/CSU sister parties on 2 July.
Caretaker goverment.
The results of the 2013 election had necessitated a series of negotiations that required the Merkel III cabinet to remain in a caretaker capacity for a prolonged period of time. Should government formation after the 2021 elections again last until Christmas 2021 or longer, Merkel will become the longest-serving Chancellor in post-war German history ahead of Helmut Kohl.

Human rights in Guatemala

Human rights is an issue in Guatemala. The establishment of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala has helped the Attorney General prosecute extrajudicial killings and corruption. There remains widespread impunity for abusers from the Guatemalan Civil War, which ran from 1960 to 1996, and Human Rights Watch considers threats and violence against unionists, journalists and lawyers a major concern.
A trial for eight former Army members on charges related to the alleged disappearances of 130 people whose bodies were found among 550 at a base now run by the UN called CREOMPAZ has been stalled since it began in 2016 due to witness intimidation, among other factors.
History.
After an ongoing civil war which lasted over 36 years in Guatemala, the country began to transition into a more stable and established democratic country. However, following the civil war, corruption began to appear all over the country and it eventually engulfed the whole country in common crimes and chaos. In 2013, the crime rate increased to where there was roughly 6,000 homicides per year in Guatemala. These violent killings included deaths of women and children. While Guatemala was fighting toward ending the corruption, there were many high-level government officials who were involved in organized crime. This resulted in only about 2% of the violent crimes going to trial. In 2015, President Otto Pérez Molina, Vice President Roxana Baldetti, and other high officials lost their power and were prosecuted for participation in human rights violation. Efraín Ríos Montt, was the President of Guatemala during 2003–2012. Montt was convicted of the charges of genocide and was sentenced to 80–85 years in jail but this was soon over turned 10 days later. During his second trial Efrain Rios Montt died on April 1, 2018 at the age of 91.

International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala organization was first established on December 12, 2005. After years of human rights violation in Guatemala, government officials began leading towards creating an established organization that would investigate the many variety of cases that were left unsolved. After getting the assistance from the United Nations, the government of Guatemala formulated an organization called Commission of Investigation of Illegal Bodies and Clandestine Security Apparatuses (CICIACS). The creation of this organization caused a controversy in Guatemala, which resulted in it being denied because the ruling deemed it to be a violation of the exclusive constitutional delegation of power to the Public Ministry. After being denied the government of Guatemala revised the document and the regulation of the CICIACS to eliminate all the unconstitutional issues that were brought to their attention from the constitutional court. When they were finished they re-introduced the proposition to the court and after the review the Constitutional court approved it. They renamed it International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The government of Guatemala and the United Nations signed it into order on December 12, 2005.
Legal issues.
According to the International Human Rights Law Group, the Guatemalan criminal justice system is to blame for the poor human rights Guatemala faces. Cerezo announced it would now be their responsibility. The Guatemalan criminal justice system is supposed to work with the court to punish those who violate human rights. With a system implemented to protect human rights in Guatemala the issue of these rights being violated remains. This is partly because the judges are not trained properly which can affect the investigation by causing them to be unreliable. The Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was established in 2007 and itworks to break down corruption within the country. After a CICIG investigation the 2015 president, Cerezo collected bribes he was later arrested. Human rights violations continue to increase with the Guatemalan people as victims because of improper protections from the government.
Gender.
Fourteen women were found victims of sexual abuse by two military officers and sentenced to prison. The two officers both have prior criminal history, one with triple homicide with three women and the other is responsible for the disappearance of the husband's to his female victims . In addition, the country's constitution does not protect LGBT rights and a bill proposed in 2017 bans students from learning about other sexual orientations and also bans same sex marriage.

Hodges Square Historic District

The Hodges Square Historic District of New London, Connecticut encompasses a working-class residential area north of the city's central business district. It is located between the campus of the United States Coast Guard Academy and Interstate 95, and is bounded on the west by Williams Street and the east by the Thames River. This area developed as a modest working-class residential area in the mid-19th century, when New London's economy began shifting from one based on maritime pursuits to one based on manufacturing. The area's residents were typically employed in nearby silk manufacturing operations, or by the Central Vermont Railroad, which had a roundhouse and service yard nearby. Hodges Square, a small cluster of commercial buildings, forms the economic center of the neighborhood.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Franziska Giffey

Franziska Giffey ( Süllke, born 3 May 1978) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who served as Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2018 until 2021. She was the Mayor of Neukölln in Berlin from April 2015 to March 2018. In December 2020, Giffey was nominated to be the SPD's mayoral candidate in the 2021 Berlin State election.
Early life and education.
Born in Frankfurt (Oder), Giffey grew up in Briesen. After her Abitur in 1997, she started studying English and French at the Humboldt University of Berlin in order to become a teacher, but had to leave the profession in 1998 for medical reasons. She subsequently studied administrative law at a "Fachhochschule" for Public Administration in Berlin from 1998 until 2001. During her graduate studies in European administrative management from 2003 to 2005, she worked at the Representation of Berlin to the European Union in Brussels in 2003 and at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in 2005. In 2005, she started extra-occupational doctoral studies at the Free University of Berlin, where she received her doctorate in 2010. Her thesis dealt with the inclusion of civil society by the European Commission in EU decision-making.
In addition to her studies, she worked as Commissioner for European Affairs in the district administration of Neukölln from 2002 to 2010.
Political career.
Giffey joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 2007.
In 2015, Giffey succeeded Heinz Buschkowsky as mayor of the Berlin district of Neukölln, home to many immigrants and high unemployment.
Federal Minister of Family Affairs, 2018–2021.
After the formation of a grand coalition between the CDU under Chancellor Angela Merkel and the SPD in the wake of the 2017 federal election, Giffey was appointed member of the fourth Merkel cabinet in March 2018, serving as Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. She succeeded Katarina Barley in this office, who became Federal Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection.
Following the 2018 Chemnitz protests, Giffey was the first member of Merkel's cabinet to visit the site where a 35-year-old German carpenter was stabbed to death.
In mid-2020, Giffey presented the government’s first equality strategy, which bundled together measures that aim to get more women into leadership roles, narrow the gender pay gap and improve work-life balance. By early 2021, she introduced legislation introducing stricter gender equality rules for government-controlled companies and measures to force larger listed companies to have at least one woman on their management boards.
Allegations of plagiarism &amp; resignation.
In 2019, allegations of plagiarism prompted the Free University of Berlin to review Giffey’s 2010 dissertation. In response, Giffey announced that she would resign if her doctorate is revoked and she would not run for the leadership of her party due to the ongoing investigation.
On 10 June 2021, the presidium of the Free University of Berlin unanimously stripped Giffey of her doctorate, saying she was guilty of 'at least partially intentional deception' and citing 69 instances in the 200-page thesis when citations were either not at all or improperly attributed.
She resigned as minister on 19 May 2021 but immediately won the candidacy for Berlin mayor from the SPD, which she has not relinquished.
Candidate for Mayor of Berlin.
When Berlin’s governing mayor Michael Müller announced his intention not to run again for his party’s leadership in the state, Giffey and Raed Saleh expressed their intention to take over as dual leaders. Giffey subsequently was voted her party's candidate to succeed Müller as mayor in the 2021 Berlin state election.
Personal life.
Giffey has been married to a veterinarian since 2009; the couple has one child. Her nephew is basketball player Niels Giffey.

Optical properties

The optical properties of a material define how it interacts with light. The optical properties of matter are studied in optical physics, a subfield of optics. The optical properties of matter include:
A basic distinction is between isotropic materials, which exhibit the same properties regardless of the direction of the light, and anisotropic ones, which exhibit different properties when light passes through them in different directions.
The optical properties of matter can lead to a variety of interesting optical phenomena.

John W. Hunter House

The John W. Hunter House is a single-family house located at 556 W. Maple Road in Birmingham, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
History.
John W. Hunter was originally from New York state, and moved to Michigan in 1818. He settled in what is now the city of Birmingham, and was soon joined by his wife, parents, and daughters. He first constructed a log cabin on his property. In 1822, Hunter hired itinerant carpenter George Taylor to construct this house, which was the first frame house built in Bloomfield Township. The original location of the house was along what is now Old Woodward, south of Maple Road and in the heart of what is now the Birmingham's commercial district. By the late 1820s, Hunter began manufacturing farm implements, building a foundry near his home as well as a furnace in Detroit. Hunter died in 1880.
At some point, John W. Hunter sold this house to his son-in-law, who by 1877 had sold it to Ira Toms. By 1893, Henry Randall was the owner, and he moved the house from its original location to Brown Street. The house passed through a series of owners who used it as a residence until 1970, when it was purchased by the city of Birmingham. The city moved it to its current location in a historical park on Maple Road.
Description.
The Hunter House is a simple -story Greek Revival house, of plank construction, measuring . It is clad with clapboard, and has a cornice with cornice return.

Alice Honora Enfield (4 January 1882 – 14 August 1935) was a British co-operative activist.
Born in Nottingham, she was the sister of Elinor Enfield. Alice studied at St Leonards School in St Andrews, and then at Somerville College, Oxford University. She became a secondary school teacher, also undertaking research in history in her spare time.
In 1913, Enfield began working for the National Federation of Women Workers, focusing on campaigning for better benefits for women under the National Health Insurance scheme. Four years later, she instead took employment with the Women's Co-operative Guild, as private secretary to Margaret Llewelyn Davies. Davies retired as secretary of the organisation in 1922, and Enfield replaced her.
Enfield was a founder of the International Women's Co-operative Guild in 1921, and became its first secretary, the following year. The role gradually expanded, and in 1927 she resigned her other posts to work full-time for the international organisation.
In her spare time, Enfield was involved in the peace movement, serving on the National Peace Council, and during 1932 on the Disarmament Committee of the International Women's Organisations. She died in 1935, while visiting Paris in an attempt to organise a women's co-operative guild there.

Arwa Saleh was born in 1951 in Cairo, and studied English literature at Cairo University. Upon graduating, she worked as a school teacher for a short time, and then as a translator for the state-owned Middle East News Agency and the Saudi-funded economic newspaper "al-'Alam al-Yawm" ("The World Today"). She wrote socio-political essays under pseudonyms, and her translations of Marxist literature appeared in internal and secret pamphlets and newsletters of the Egyptian Communist Workers Party (Hizb al-'Ummal al-Shuyu'i al-Misri), which functioned as an underground organization. 
Involvement in radical politics.
Saleh was a prominent figure in the radical student movement of the early 1970s, which arose in response to the defeat of Egypt in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and opposition to al-Sadat's regime. An earlier wave of radical student politics in Egypt broke out in 1968, demanding harsher punishment for those responsible for the defeat in the Arab-Israeli war. Many leaders of this wave were co-opted by the regime or successfully intimidated and arrested. This wave of student activism facilitated the mobilization and recruitment of more students in political life. In late 1971 and early 1972, a new wave of demonstrations and strikes led by students erupted, with popular support. Anwar al-Sadat's cuts to public spending and suppression of freedom of speech provoked anger and fear, and the stalemate with Israel meant that many students spent a prolonged period in mandatory military service with no hope of entering the job market. Student movements, as a result, became more organized and militant—they circulated leaflets, pamphlets and organized meetings criticizing the regime. Students occupied campuses for weeks, employing the machines and print supplies of the official Cairo University Press to print their statements. 
Arwa Saleh and Siham Sabri led sit-in strikes in Cairo University, and alongside many others, composed essays for wall posters, slogans, read poetry and performed plays. When the police stormed the campus on 29 December 1972, both student leaders were arrested and spent time in jail. In late December 1972 and early January 1973, students occupied Tahrir Square in Cairo (a scene remembered and replicated in January 2011). Despite state repression and the lack of an independent press, the students gained support from the public who joined the call to liberate Sinai from Israel and end authoritarianism. Saleh's deep engagement and involvement in these protests would inform her later work. "al-Mubtasarun" [The Stillborn] would reflect on the legacy of the 1960s student leaders—who she termed as 'the melancholy generation'—and the frustrated hopes of the student movement of the 1970s who failed to translate mass nationalist support into support for an agenda tackling class inequity, wealth redistribution and other social issues—as such, to her this generation is 'premature'. 
Salih became a member of the central committee of the Egyptian Communist Workers Party, a large organization that grew out of the student movement of 1972 and was also involved in the 1977 uprisings against Sadat's economic liberalization policies. But many Marxist and other leftist organizations were small circles of intellectuals, with a limited base among workers, and riven with minor theoretical differences. Many activists and intellectuals in these circles drifted away from the movement in the 1980s—they quit political activism and joined non-governmental organizations, international humanitarian agencies, or Islamist movements. 
Later life and published writing.
Salih's depression at the failure of the revolutionary Left's promise and the reality of Egypt in the 1980s led her to break away from the party. She later left for Spain. She wrote in this period, reflecting on her bitterness with the organizations she was once involved with, the sexual exploitation that women suffered within communist organizations and the behaviour of male intellectuals within the party and movement. In work later published posthumously, she wrote that she had received psychiatric treatment while she was away. Her first manuscript (which was lost and never published) and a posthumously published autobiographical text 'Strolling: Daydream of a Lonely Rover' was dedicated to patients in psychiatric clinics. She later also published an Arabic translation of Tony Cliff's 1984 book "Class Struggle and Women's Liberation." 
Her most prominent work "al-Mubtasarun" ["The Premature" or "The Stillborn"] was a memoir of her experience in the student movement of the 1970s, with the stated goal of the 1990s generation perhaps learning from the mistakes of the 1960s and 70s. The book was published five years after she wrote it, and was issued with a new introduction. The book takes aim at hierarchical structures within communist organizations based on age, seniority and frequently, gender, accusing male activists of 'consuming' women in the movement, preying on young women and sexually defaming them if they resisted male advances. She also criticizes the pretence of intellectualism among communist leaders, prioritizing publication over effectively organizing resistance to the regime or attempting to gain public support for their goals.
Sana' al-Masri stated that Salih had to secure a job when her supervisor at "al-'Alam al-Yawm", a former Marxist activist, persecuted her for the publication of "al-Mubtasarun", to prove to the newspaper's management that he disavowed his Marxist past. But Salih's sharp criticism of her former comrades in "al-Mubtasarun", many of whom now headed Western-funded organizations, meant that many of them refused to hire her too. 
Throughout her adult life, she suffered from clinical depression and episodes of schizophrenia. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, she committed suicide in 1997, a few months after the publication of "al-Mubtasarun". 
Personal life.
Salih married three times—twice to communist intellectuals, and one brief marriage to a much younger poet of the 1990s generation. She was involved romantically with several comrades in the movement over her life, and wrote in "al-Mubtasarun" of the treatment of women and sexual liberation by male intellectuals in leftist circles, though without referring directly to her own experiences. Her first real lover, to whom she dedicated the book, was the young intellectual Baha' al-Naqqash. 
Death and posthumous publications.
In 1997 Arwa Saleh committed suicide by jumping from a tenth floor apartment. The event is referred to in Ahdaf Soueif's 1999 novel "The Map of Love", and Soueif and Salih had studied together in the English Department at Cairo University in the early 1970s. Her death has also been given fictional treatment in Radwa Ashour's 2008 novel "Release" as well as Youssef Rakha's 2014 novel "The Crocodiles". In Fathi Imbabi's "al-Sab'iyyun" ("The 1970s Generation)," Imbabi published a long eulogy for Salih without mentioning her name apart from in the dedication, holding her comrades (including himself) as responsible for her depression and suicide.
A short and hastily edited selection of her papers was published in 1998—these included an excerpt from her memoirs, a long poem and an essay on the novelist Son'allah Ibrahim's fiction —and was titled "Saratan al-Rawh" ("Cancer of the Soul"). "al-Mubtasarun" was later reissued in 2016, by the Egyptian General Book Organization, a Ministry of Culture organ, as part of its 'family library' series.

Washington and Colorado serial rape cases

Between 2008 and 2011, a series of rapes in the suburbs around Seattle and Denver were perpetrated by Marc Patrick O'Leary, an Army veteran who had previously been stationed near Tacoma. Police did not believe the first victim, an 18-year-old woman known as Marie, who reported being raped at her home in Lynnwood, Washington. Detectives' bullying and hounding of her, according to a later report, led Marie to recant her statement, allowing her to be charged with making a false report of rape. O'Leary went on to rape five more women in a similar manner, one in Washington and four in Colorado.
O'Leary was arrested in Lakewood, Colorado in February 2011, following 40 days of investigation by a team of detectives collaborating across several departments. The investigators used similarities in the attacker's methods, along with photos found on O'Leary's computer, to link O'Leary to the five rapes in both states. He pleaded guilty to multiple counts of rape and was sentenced to the maximum years in prison in Colorado and a total of years in Washington. O'Leary is currently imprisoned in the Sterling Correctional Facility.
Between 2008 and 2012, Lynnwood police labeled 21 percent of rape cases as "unfounded", five times the national average for similarly sized municipalities. An outside review of Marie's case by the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office found that she had been "coerced into admitting that she lied", and that the police had ignored strong evidence of the crime to focus on "minor inconsistencies" in her account. As a result, Lynnwood police have since adopted new training methods for sexual assault investigations, and must have "definitive proof" of lying before questioning a rape report. Despite the critical review, no Lynnwood police officers were professionally disciplined.
T. Christian Miller of ProPublica and Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for their "examination and exposé of law enforcement's enduring failures" in the rape investigations. Their work, titled "An Unbelievable Story of Rape", was used as the basis for an episode of "This American Life", narrated in part by Armstrong, and the Netflix series "Unbelievable".

Bor, Mamor, Benye

Bor, Mámor, Bénye Festival (Wine, Shine...Bénye) - festival in the gardens of Erdőbénye was born in 2009 from an ideas session of six wineries in Hungary, Tokaj Wine Region, Erdőbénye. The local wine makers, who later formed an association – have staged this gastro-cultural event every year since.
History.
The Beginnings.
The event was born in 2009 from an ideas session and cooperation between six local wineries. The first festival was a one-day event on 15 th August 2009 where, as well as the local wineries, Hungarian gastrobloggers and regional restaurants created dishes founded on Zemplén flavours and raw ingredients, thus developing a distinct gastro-thread.
Due to great interest, in 2010 the participants founded the Bor, Mámor, Bénye Association to be able to continue the work more professionally and since then it has been the Festival organizer.
Two years later, in 2011, the festival expanded with a Friday night opening concert and joint tasting of all where the participating wineries came together to present their wines at a guided tasting.
Expansion.
By 2013 the festival ran Friday-Saturday- Sunday with more events. By then over 12 wineries had joined the initiative and the event had become known throughout Hungary and popular with wine lovers from Poland and the Carpathian Basin. The festival also offered a campsite and parking area by then. That is when the entry system was introduced.
Today.
In 2016 the event was a four-day event, to be more precise three days+zero day. The opening concert which had been on Friday moved with the joint tasting to Thursday evening. In 2017 the date of the festival changed to early July. The event will return to the original August time in 2019.
Venue.
The event is held in Hungary, in the Tokaj Wine Region village of Erdőbénye, where the venues for the wide range of events are the local gardens and cellars of the wineries, churches, village house museum and nearby vineyards.
Current participants: Ábrahám Wine, Bardon Winery, Béres Vineyards and Winery, Budaházy-Fekete Kúria Winery, Csite Family Estate, Illés Cellar, Jakab Winery, Karádi-Berger Winery, Kerékgyártó Cellar, Préselő Winery, Pro Vinum Winery, Sanzon Tokaj, Vayi Winery.
Gastronomy.
It was primarily gastro-bloggers who created the dishes at the beginning. Over the years top restaurants from the region and Hungary came to the forefront. The organizers aim to show local ingredients and recipes in the long term. The Tokaj Wine Region produces white wines and the wines that can be tasted in the wineries’ cellars are mainly white wines: The main varieties are Furmint, Hárslevelű and Muscat Lunel along with cuvées hereof.
Events.
The long weekend starts with Thursday evening joint tasting in which all the wineries participate followed by a concert. The other days of the festival see the wineries’ gardens become the venues for events.
Music ranges through jazz, folk music and world music. Artists have performed here including Muzsikás, Viktor Tóth, Vilmos Gryllus, Mihály Dresch, but the organizers place great emphasis on bringing less well-known talents to the festival too. From 2018 the event also provides a home for the coopers’ dance, unique to this barrel-making village, and showing the traditions of barrel making. In addition there are exhibitions, literary readings and interviews, plus handcrafts, children’s events, round table discussions, thematic tastings, bicycle tours and other events.

The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue

The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue is a compilation album and the first album overall by English avant-pop band Stavely Makepeace, released in May 2004 by reissue label RPM Records. Compiled by journalist Bob Stanley, it contains a string of singles recorded between 1969 and 1984 that the band recorded in their home studio and released on various record labels. The band, primarily consisting of Rod Woodward and Nigel Fletcher, were influenced by Joe Meek, and started the band in order to explore experimental and disparate ideas within pop music, describing their musical style as the "scrap iron sound" in reference to their incorporation of unusual instruments. Their singles were commercially unsuccessful, though the band would find major success with "Mouldy Old Dough" (1972) under the extended line-up of Lieutenant Pigeon.
Though Lieutenant Pigeon were subject to a "best of" compilation in 2001, "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" marked the first time that Stavely Makepeace released a compilation of their material, following the appearance of their 1972 single "Slippery Rock '70s" on the compilation "Velvet Tinmine" (2003), which compiled obscure glam rock singles. "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" received critical acclaim, with praise given to the idiosyncratic songs and production. The producers of "Hot Fuzz" used "Sloppy Rock '70s" in the film after hearing it on the compilation, somewhat rising the band's profile.
Background and release.
Band career.
Rob Woodward (born in Coventry in 1945) became a professional musician in 1963 and released two unsuccessful singles under the name Shel Naylor on Decca Records between 1963–64 before the label dropped him, which resulted in him returning to performing on the nightclub circuit. It was at this stage that he began collaboration with Nigel Fletcher. The music that the pair made together was eccentric pop, reflecting their obsession with producer Joe Meek. The pair were separated while Fletcher served in the British Merchant Navy, but their creative partnership was resumed in late 1968 after Fletcher was discharged. They moved into the Coventry home of Woodward's mother Hilda, and set up their own makeshift recording studio in her living room. They dubbed their project Stavely Makepeace and added Pete Fisher on bass and Don Ker on drums to flesh out their initial sessions.
The duo experimented with disparate musical ideas in the studio, allegedly taking influence from Elvis Presley and Gene Vincent, despite Stavely Makepeace's music bearing little to no resemblance to either performer. Stavely Makepeace referred to the style of music they created as the "scrap iron sound," the name referring to how they relied on experimentation as much as they did musicianship. This followed Joe Meek's ideas of sound creation in that, for as long as a sound is considered great, it does not matter how it is produced. The duo became confident enough to record a number of songs to take to different record labels. Pyramid Records took interest in the band and released their debut single, "(I Want to Love You Like a) Mad Dog", in mid-1969. Before Pyramid could release the band's projected second single, "Reggae Denny", the label went bankrupt. They added guitarist Steve Tayton on guitar and woodwinds in early 1970 and, following the departure of Fisher, Steve Johnson joined the band as the replacement bassist. The band signed to Concord Records and scored a minor hit with "Edna," which was performed by the band on "Top of the Pops". It was first released by Concorde in the UK in 1970 and was then released by EMI in France on 14 August and by Deutsche Grammophon in Germany two weeks later, an example of Concorde's continental distribution deal with the two latter labels.
The single was followed by 1971's "Smokey Mountain Rhythm Revue", whose tongue-in-cheek instrumental B-side, "Rampant on the Rage," inspired the creation of a side-project band named Lieutenant Pigeon, who had the same line-up as Stavely Makepeace but with the addition of Woodward's mother Hilda on piano. This single was in turn followed by "Give Me That Pistol" later on in 1971. Despite Woodward and Fletcher being so productive in the early 1970s that they would write at least a song a week for the Stavely Makepeace project, none of Stavely Makepeace's singles had been successful so far, and this pattern continued when they left Concorde and released a trio of singles on Spark Records. Their first single for Spark, "Slippery Rock '70s" (1972), nonetheless received airplay on BBC Radio 1 by Dave Lee Travis. Meanwhile, as Lieutenant Pigeon, the members had found success when "Mouldy Old Dough", a novelty instrumental that unfaithfully replicated vintage pub music in an "odd and off" fashion with growled vocals, reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of the best-selling singles of 1972 and also allowing its 1973 follow-up "Desperate Dan" to reach number 17.
After the release of Stavely Makepeace' final Spark singles "Walking Through the Blue Glass" (1972) and "Prima Donna" (1973), the band released "Cajun Band" on Deram Records to further public indifference. When 1974's "Runaround Sue" also flopped, the band focused their attention on Lieutenant Pigeon. The Stavely Makepeace outtakes "Baby Blue Eyes" and "No Regrets" were released to no success by Unigram Records in 1977 and Barn Records in 1978 respectively, but convinced the band to reunite. Nonetheless, when the 1980 Hammer Records single "Songs of Yesterday" and 1983's self-released "Just Tell Her Fred Said Goodbye" both flopped, the pair permanently discontinued Stavely Makepeace and once again focused on the long-lived Lieutenant Pigeon. Woodward and Fletcher also continued their partnership in other ventures, including voice-overs and radio jingles and the 2001 joint autobiography "When Show Business Is No Business".
Compilation.
For a lengthy period of time, Stavely Makepeace's material was left uncompiled. This was in contrast to Lieutenant Pigeon, who were subject to the Cherry Red Records compilation "The Best of Lieutenant Pigeon" (2001), which combined the band's 1970s singles alongside album tracks and unreleased songs. In February 2003, Stavely Makepeace's 1972 single "Slippery Rock '70s" appeared on the various artists compilation "Velvet Tinmine", which compiled 20 obscure glam rock singles from the 1970s. Interest in the group had picked up, which allowed the band to release a compilation of their material. Named "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" after the band's description of their musical style, the album compiles most of the band's singles, recorded between 1969 and 1984, and is their first overall album. The BBC noted that, with the compilation, "it took thirty-six years for Stavely Makepeace to release their first album." It features 22 tracks and was compiled by journalist and musician Bob Stanley with help from Mark Stratford, whose reissue label, RPM Records, released the compilation on 24 May 2004. The album's lengthy liner notes are written by the band themselves. Lora Findlay designed the album artwork.
Musical style.
In their reviews of "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue", critics highlighted the unusual, disparate sound to the songs. "Uncut" felt that the band fused 1970s MOR music with DIY avant-garde, and wrote: "Speeding up and multi-tracking home recordings in their mum's front room, they concocted phased, clunking West Midlands exotica and spliced whole new genres: radiophonic cajun reggae, yodelling steam-punk, Joe Meek boogie." AllMusic made note that, as was the case with Lieutenant Pigeon's output, Stavely Makepeace's home productions focused on applying quirky, moderately lo-fi production to simplistic pop songs with strong echoes of both British novelty music and 1950s rock and roll, with songs boasting fiddle lines, horns, old-fashioned piano and "anachronistic" use of echo. Unlike the largely instrumental Lieutenant Pigeon, the music on "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" is generally more focused on songs with vocals. Bob Stanley made note of the band's "Dada" sound.
Their 1969 debut single "(I Wanna Love You Like a) Mad Dog" opens the compilation. According to Stanley, the song "sounds like a one-man oompah band" that has been phased to "simulate a psychedelic experience." It features tongue-in-cheek sexual lyrics that Stanley compared to the controversial lyrics of Marie Lloyd. "Edna" is a pop song with the high pitched refrain – sung by either Woodward or Fletcher – of "Ed-ed, Ed-ed, Ed-ed-ed-ed-Edna, let me sing my beautiful song." The BBC described the song's vocals as "quirky" yodelling. In comparing the band's eclectic array of styles, they also felt it contrasted with the rock and roll-styled "Runaround Sue".
Their 1972 single "Slippery Rock '70s" was recorded as the "slightly rocky" backing to a track named "Fan It". When Woodward and Fletcher attempted to add vocals to the track, they agreed it would sound better without singing, thus erased the vocals and shelved the remaining track. A chance meeting with Spark Records' Bob Kingston, who heard the backing track by accident when listening to a tape of the band's material, believed it to be a completed instrumental and told the band it was impressive enough to release as a single, although a name was needed. Fletcher named it "Slippery Rock" after the borough in Pennsylvania where he had recently stayed. The "70s" suffix was added by Spark. "Uncut" felt the song "glimmered with authentic strangeness."
Reception and legacy.
"The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" received positive reviews from critics. As was the case with "The Best of Lieutenant Pigeon", "The Scrap Iron Rhythm Revue" received four and a half stars out of five from AllMusic and was named an "Album Pick". Writing for the website, Richie Unterberger felt that even though the singles compiled on the album "aimed for the pop charts," they had been unsuccessful because Woodward and Nigel were "just a little too strange for their own good." He felt the "idiosyncratic production" was more interesting than the songs, but felt that the compilation does "justice" to the band's legacy. "Uncut" felt that the compilation proved that the band consistently created genuinely unusual songs, and wrote that: "Their destiny was as a novelty footnote, but this exemplary reissue excavates a weirdly potent homebrew 10cc."
The producers of the 2007 comedy film "Hot Fuzz" decided to use "Slippery Rock 70s" in the film's soundtrack after hearing it on the compilation. Fletcher paid to see the film to see if the instrumental was used and was pleased to hear it used in its entirety. It was the first time that Fletcher had been enquired by others to use a Stavely Makepeace track in a project, and helped rise the band's profile, with the "Coventry Telegraph" calling it the band's "big break." Jamie Hewlett of Gorillaz became a fan of the band. "(I Wanna Love You Like a) Mad Dog" features on the protopunk compilation "Punk 45: Sick On You! One Way Spit! After The Love &amp; Before The Revolution - Proto-Punk 1970-77 Vol. 3", released in 2014 by Soul Jazz Records. In 2015, Stavely Makepeace reunited to release the one-off comeback single "Time Marches On," a song which was described by the "Coventry Telegraph" as "as quirky" as the band's other material and as tracking the advent of pop music since the 1950s.

Ibn al‐Raqqam

Ibn Al‐Raqqam Muḥammad Ibn Ibrahim Al‐Mursi Al‐Andalusi Al‐Tunisi Al‐Awsi () also known as Ibn Al‐Raqqam was a 13th century Andalusian-Arab astronomer, mathematician and physician; but also a Sunni Muslim theologian and jurist.
Biography.
Abu Abdullah Ibn Al-Raqam was born in Murcia in 1250, in an family with the nisba "al-Awsi", probably from the Banu Aws tribe, and grew up and learned there until the city was annexed by Castile in 1266. He left Murcia for the city of Bejaia, in present-day Algeria, and lived there until he went to Tunisia and spent time there writing some of his books. Later in his life, he settled in Granada, the capital of the Emirate of Granada, after accepting an invitation from Muhammad II of Granada.
Although several works have been attributed to him by Ibn Al-Khatib, only three ones have survived in an extant form. Two of this works are astronomical tables that are similar in both subject and content. However, differences in the latitudes do exist, since the tables were created to adapt the coordinates of two different cities, Béjaïa and Tunis. The third work, "Risāla fiʿilm Al‐Zilal", is an important treatise on sundials, and the only complete one of its kind to have survived from Al-Andalus.

Cinnamyl acetate

Cinnamyl acetate (3-phenylprop-2-enyl acetate) is a chemical compound of the cinnamyl ester family, in which the variable R group is substituted by a methyl group. As a result of the non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond, cinnamyl acetate can exist in a "Z" and an "E" configuration:
Cinnamyl acetate naturally occurs in fresh bark of cinnamon ("Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume" and other Cinnamomum species), with concentrations of 2,800–51,000 ppm.
Cinnamyl acetate is used as a flavour ester in for example bread and animal feed and has a sweet floral-fruity fragrance. Moreover, it is used in several cosmetics, some toiletries but also in non-cosmetic products, for example detergents.
Legislation and control.
Cinnamyl acetate, used in fragrances and as flavour ingredient, has been discussed by several institutions. In 1965, the compound was annotated as 'Generally Recognized as Safe as a flavor ingredient’ by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers" Association (FEMA). The association determined the average maximum use levels in several products that were considered to be safe:
The European Parliament registered cinnamyl acetate as both a flavouring substance and a cosmetic compound in 1996. The Joint (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) described in 2000 that “the substance does not present a safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavouring agent”. In 2009, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzyme, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) concluded that cinnamyl acetate does not give rise to safety concerns when used as flavour ingredient in food. Cinnamyl acetate is also permitted by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug administration for use as flavouring agent in food if the minimum quantity needed for its effect is used.
Production and intake.
Estimates of the average annual production and daily intake of cinnamyl acetate as flavouring agent are reported by the WHO. According to this report, the annual volume of production in Europe is 1498 kg, and in the USA 2255 kg. The daily intake per person in Europe is estimated to be 210 μg, and in the USA 300 μg. Per kg body weight the daily intake is estimated for Europeans to be 4 μg/kg and for Americans to be 5 μg/kg.
Synthesis.
Since cinnamyl acetate is naturally occurring in plants, it can be extracted and purified to obtain the compound. However, this has a low yield and therefore the production costs are high. The use of chemical methods can offer more efficient strategies to produce cinnamyl acetate.
There are multiple ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate 2. One way is the synthesis from cinnamyl alcohol 1 and vinyl acetate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme triacylglycerol ester hydrolase, which is a lipase that is very specific towards the ester bond. The byproduct of this reaction is acetaldehyde. The reaction equation for this reaction is:
Since acetaldehyde has an unfavourable deactivating effect on the lipase used in the synthesis, ethyl acetate can be used as reactant instead of vinyl acetate. In this transesterification reaction cinnamyl alcohol 1 reacts with ethyl acetate to form cinnamyl acetate 2 and ethanol. This synthesis requires the lipase Novozym 435, and is performed in a solvent-free system. The reaction is as follows:
Cinnamyl acetate 2 can also be synthesized via a non-enzymatic reaction. An example of such a reaction is one with the use of cinnamyl bromide 3 and sodium acetate as reactants. Since these compounds are immiscible substrates, solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis (PTC) can be used, using quaternary ammonium bromide as a phase transfer catalyst. This is shown in the following reaction:
Besides these three examples, there are many more ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate.
The addition reaction of dinitrogen trioxide to cinnamyl acetate produces an intermediate in the synthesis of chloramphenicol.
Metabolism.
Cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl derivatives. In general, these cinnamyl derivatives are absorbed from the gut very quickly, after which they are metabolized and excreted as polar metabolites in the urine or feces within 24 hours.
Within the cinnamyl derivatives, cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl esters. After absorption from the gut, this group of compounds is first hydrolyzed to cinnamyl alcohol by carboxylesterases. Carboxylesterases are a group of enzymes. The most important enzymes within this group are the A-esterases. These are present in most body tissues, but they are prevalent in the hepatocytes. Subsequently, the cinnamyl alcohol is oxidized which leads to the formation of cinnamaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by human NAD+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. Now, there are two routes for the further biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde. The minor route of biotransformation is the S-glutathionylation. The major route, however, is the conversion of cinnamaldehyde into cinnamic acid by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. Next, the cinnamic acid is transformed into cinnamoyl CoA which is again converted to either cinnamoylglycine by N-acyl transferase or to benzoyl CoA through β-oxidation, the latter being the major route. Intermediate metabolites in the β-oxidation pathway can be converted to 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid and acetophenone, which can be excreted via the urine. However, the conversions of these intermediate metabolites are minor routes. Finally, the benzoyl CoA is conjugated with glycine under formation of hippuric acid or it is hydrolyzed generating free benzoic acid. This can be excreted via the urine directly or after glucuronidation. Hippuric acid, which is the major metabolite, is also excreted via the urine.
Toxicity.
Since cinnamyl acetate is used as both a fragrance material and a food flavouring ingredient, dermal and oral exposure are considered to be the major routes of absorption. The dermal systematic exposure of cinnamyl acetate via cosmetic products is estimated to be 0.0115 mg/kg body weight/day.
Several experiments using animals were conducted in the past to assess the toxicity of cinnamyl acetate. In one experiment, the oral toxicity was tested in rats. The rats received oral doses of cinnamyl acetate and the LD50 was found to be 3.3 g/kg. During the experiment, symptoms as slow respiration and coarse tremors were observed for high doses. Other experiments showed LD50 values of 4.750 g/kg for oral administration in mice and guinea pigs. Also, the LD50 value for intraperitoneal administration was investigated and found to be 1.200 g/kg.
Furthermore, studies on the dermal toxicity were performed. Experiments on rabbits resulted in an LD50 of more than 5.0 g/kg, but no clinical effects were observed. Moreover, the level of skin irritation in swines was tested via a 48-h patch test. In this study, 0.05 g of cinnamyl acetate was applied and no irritation was observed. Another two experiments examined the skin irritation caused by 0.1 mL cinnamyl acetate on guinea pigs and rabbits via a direct application on the skin (open application). Mild to moderate irritation was observed in these experiments.
A NOAEL for oral administration of 275 mg/kg body weight/day was determined from toxicological data by the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP).
Besides these experiments on animals, some human studies were executed. A 48-h closed patch test on five healthy, male volunteers was performed using 5% cinnamyl acetate in petrolatum. In this study, no irritation was observed. Mild irritation was observed in another 48-h patch test on fifty male volunteers using 32% cinnamyl acetate in acetone. Finally, a human study on skin sensitization was executed on 25 healthy, male volunteers. In this experiment a maximization test (48-h patch) was done using 5% cinnamyl acetate in petrolatum. Skin sensitization reactions were not observed.
Moreover, standard Draize tests were used to assess the dermal toxicity in humans, guinea pigs and rabbits. This resulted in mild skin irritation for doses of 16 mg per 48 hours for humans and for doses of 100 mg per 24 hours for guinea pigs. Moderate skin irritation was observed for rabbits exposed to doses of 100 mg per 24 hours.
Lastly, the potential of cinnamyl acetate to cause sister chromatid exchanges was tested using Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells. This was done because it was found that another component of plant essence and cinnamyl derivative, cinnamaldehyde, increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges induced by mitomycin C. However, the result of this test proved that cinnamyl acetate does not cause sister chromatid exchange due to the absence of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl group.
Effects on animals.
Cinnamyl acetate is found in the leaf oils of the "Cinnamomum osmophloeum" tree, which grows in central and northern Taiwan. It is found that these oils have antibacterial, antimildew, antitermite, antimite, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, the oils show mosquito larvicidal activity against "Aedes aegypti" and "Aedes albopictus" larvae. However, cinnamyl acetate serves only a minor role in these activities.
Moreover, cinnamyl acetate has a repellent effect on "Anopheles gambiae", and is therefore useful to protect against these insects.

Mount Crawford, South Australia

Mount Crawford is a locality in the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia. It is named after the mountain of the same name in its boundaries, also known as Teetaka.
The locality of Mount Crawford is crossed by Warren Road (route B34 between Williamstown and Birdwood) and edged by Route B35 where it branches from that road towards Mount Pleasant. The space between the two roads is Cromer, but both sides of the Y junction are Mount Crawford. The Warren Conservation Park and south bank of Warren Reservoir are also in Mount Crawford. The South Para River rises in Mount Crawford, then flows along the northern boundary of the locality, through the Warren Reservoir. The Heysen Trail (a long distance hiking trail) also crosses Mount Crawford.
Mount Crawford is located within the local government areas of the Adelaide Hills Council and the Barossa Council. It is within the boundaries of the Adelaide Hills wine region.
In 1846, Mount Crawford's population was recorded as 530; by 1855 it was down to 397. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were 127 people living there in 2016.

Jesse Clement Gray

Jesse Clement Gray (12 July 1854 – 24 February 1912) was a British co-operative activist.
Born in Ripley, Derbyshire, Gray's father was the local Baptist minister. In 1860, the family moved to Hebden Bridge, and Gray was educated at the town's grammar school.
Gray left school at the age of thirteen, and became a clerk for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. He was interested in the co-operative movement, and so in 1874 became the assistant secretary of the Hebden Bridge Fustian Society, a full-time post. He proved successful in the role, and was promoted to become the organisation's general secretary before he had even spent six months in the post.
Gray began making a national reputation for himself, championing co-operative production methods, in addition to the co-operative retail which was becoming widespread. In 1883, he was appointed as assistant secretary of the Co-operative Union, and was promoted to become its secretary in 1891. He also became secretary of the International Co-operative Alliance, serving from 1902 until 1908.
In 1906, Gray proposed that the various retail co-operatives in the UK amalgamate, to be run by an elected general council with 150 members. This proposal was not taken up. He retired in 1910, due to failing health, and died in Manchester two years later. He is buried in Hebden Bridge with a monument in the graveyard funded by the movement.

Mona Maclean

Mona Maclean, Medical Student (1892) was the debut novel of Scottish author and medical practitioner Margaret Todd. It was published under the male pseudonym Graham Travers.
Plot summary.
The novel opens with Mona - an orphan and student at the London School of Medicine for Women - failing her Intermediate Examinations. Taking an extended break from her studies, she stays with her distant cousin, Rachel, a shopkeeper in rural Scotland. Rachel asks Mona to conceal her identity as a medical student from the local community and start working with her in the shop. Mona complies but finds the ruse difficult to sustain after she falls for a male medical student, Ralph Dudley, who is staying nearby. By the close of the novel, Mona and Dudley have successfully passed their medical examinations. They get married and set up a joint practice.
Themes.
The novel's key themes include women's education and work, female friendships, and marriage. Drawing on Todd's own experiences, the story explores women's roles in the medical profession. Charles Ferrall and Anna Jackson suggest that Mona's story is "largely about the negotiation of class" rather than romance. Mona's middle-class status becomes temporarily strained not only by her choice to pursue a medical vocation, but also by her decision to live with her poor relations.
Reception.
The novel was well-received upon its publication and reached fifteen editions by 1900. "The Academy" described it as ‘one of the freshest and brightest novels of the time’.
In the twenty-first century, "Mona Maclean" has attracted interest from literary critics and historians due to its positive depiction of a female medical student.

Ada Jane Rohu

Ada Rohu (1848 – 1928), full name Jane Catherine Rohu, was a pioneering Australian taxidermist and businesswoman.
Biography.
Early life.
Ada Jane Rohu was born on 16 March 1848 in London. Her parents were Jane Catharine Tost, an English taxidermist and museum worker, and Charles Gottleibe Tost, a Prussian pianoforte-maker. The family migrated from England to Tasmania when Ada was seven years old, arriving in Hobart Town in January 1856. In 1860 they moved to Sydney, where Jane Tost worked as a taxidermist at the Australian Museum.
Career.
As a young woman Ada acted at the Queen Victoria Theatre in Sydney. She married James Richardson Coates in 1868 and they had three children. After James' death in 1872 Ada and her mother Jane opened a taxidermy shop, Tost &amp; Coates (later Tost &amp; Rohu), at 60 William Street, Sydney. Their customers included museums and scientific collectors as well as middle-class households shopping for interior decor. Known as "the queerest shop in Australia", their business supplied the Australian Museum with many important specimens.
In 1891, Ada helped to prepare the Australian exhibit for the Chicago World’s Fair.
Ada and Jane exhibited their taxidermy work at many international exhibitions, and between 1860 and 1900 won more than 20 medals. Their work was valued for its skill and for its innovative treatment of Australian fauna. One known example of Ada Rohu's taxidermy work survives: a squirrel held by the Australian Museum.
Marriage and children.
Ada married James Richardson Coates on 8 October 1868 in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. They had three children. James Coates died fighting a fire at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Sydney, in 1872.
On 12 September 1878 she married Henry Steward Boventure Rohu, with whom she had six children.
Death and afterward.
Ada Jane Rohu died on 28 July 1928 at Newtown and was buried in Rookwood Cemetery.

Shia narrations.
Shia Islam regards Fatimah as Sayyidat Nisa Alamin and actually considers her as the greatest woman of the world(s) of all times; and such titles of Fatimah are retrieved from the narrations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. and likewise Imam Ali.
It is narrated that the Islamic prophet Muhammad said "Fatimah is the leader of the ladies of paradise"; besides, Imam Jafar al-Sadiq said that Fatimah is the leader of the women of paradise from the beginning until the end of the world.
Additionally, Sayyidat Nisa' al-'Alamin as the title of Fatimah has been mentioned in diverse Ziyarats such as Ziyarat Ashura, Ziyarat Hazrat Zahra, Ziyarat Imam Reza, Ziyarat Vaareth, and so on.
Sunni narrations.
Sunni Islam considers Fatimah (Muhammad's daughter and Ali's wife) as Sayyidat Nisa al-Alamin;, although there are also some other narrations from Sunni sources which name four women as the greatest women of the universes, namely Khadijah, Fatimah, Maryam, and Asiyah (Pharaoh's wife).
There are quotations from famous Sunni scholars who name Fatimah as Sayyidat Nisa Al-Alamin, There are also similar narration(s) from Sunni sources that the Islamic Prophet Muhammad said to Fatimah: O Fatimah, aren't you happy to be the leader of the women of the world and the leader of all Mo'men women and the leader of this Ummah women.

Edward Owen Greening

Edward Owen Greening (17 August 1836 – 5 March 1923) was a British co-operative and radical activist.
Born in Warrington, Greening grew up in Bedford, Lancashire and then Manchester, as his father's wire-drawing business moved location. He was educated at a Quaker school on Mount Street in Manchester, but left when he was thirteen years old, to become an apprentice wire-drawer. Three years later, he was promoted to an office position, and he began taking evening classes. Greening's father emigrated to Canada in 1855, and Greening took the opportunity to start his own wire-drawing business with a brother. This proved successful.
From an early age, Greening became involved in local radical causes, including the Anti-Slavery Society, the United Kingdom Alliance, and the Union and Emancipation Society. In particular, he became joint honorary secretary of the last of these, and lectured around the country in support of its aim, supporting the north in the American Civil War. He was a founder of the Manchester and Salford Manhood Suffrage League - the local section of the Reform League - and also became interested in co-operation, beginning to incorporate the ideas into his own business. He also helped fund a significant number of co-operative ventures, most of which proved unsuccessful. The key exception was the Agricultural and Horticultural Association, also known as the "One and All Association", which provided agricultural tools, seeds, and related items.
In 1867, Greening became the founder and editor of "Industrial Partnership Record", which the following year became "Social Economist", Greening then sharing editing duties with G. J. Holyoake. That year, he also organised a national conference of co-operative activists, in Manchester, the immediate predecessor of the modern Co-operative Congress.
Greening stood in Halifax at the 1868 UK general election, with the backing of a local committee of radical workers. Although he did not receive the backing of the Reform League, its local branch did support his candidacy. However, he was easily defeated by two official Liberal Party candidates.
Later in 1868, Greening moved to London, to become managing director of the One and All. His wire-drawing business collapsed in 1870, and he thereafter remained focused on his co-operative interests. He founded the Co-operative Institute and the annual National Co-operative Festival. He was a founder of the International Co-operative Alliance, chairing its first conference, and was its secretary from 1895 until 1902. He was also a founder of the Co-operative Productive Federation, and the Labour Association.
The One and All closed in 1915, its business affected by World War I, and this left Greening short of money. Co-operative societies twice organised testimonial funds for him, and he remained active in the movement. In 1917, he moved the motion opposing the formation of the Co-operative Party, as he believed that the movement should be represented through existing political parties. By the autumn of 1917 he had changed his mind and at the party's emergency conference he said that "after the great vote at Swansea he recognised that it was necessary that the experiment should be made in direct representation".
Greening married twice, the first in 1860 to Emily Hepworth. Greening died at his home in Lee, London on 5 March 1923 and was buried in Hither Green Cemetery.

Botoșani.
He went through several trials in Romania, before landing a contract with Liga I side FC Botoșani in June 2014. His contract, however, was terminated in July 2014.
Mallorca.
He left Romania to undergo a new series of tryouts in Spain, eventually ending up training with Segunda División side RCD Mallorca. After convincing "Los Bermellones" of his worth during two-week trial, he signed a contract with the club in September 2014. However, problems with his visa kept him effectively out of the team for 7 months before he was eventually cleared to play. In his two seasons with the club, he only managed to appear in one match.
Ergotelis.

He scored a second brace on April 1, 2018, in a 5−1 victory over Panegialios.
Efford quickly became the focal point of Ergotelis' attack in the 2018–19 season, finishing as top-scorer for the club with 11 goals.

HD Media

HD Media Co., LLC is a Huntington, West Virginia based publisher of daily and weekly newspapers and magazines. It was established by Doug Reynolds in 2013 to purchase the Herald-Dispatch from Champion Industries.
Newspapers.
"The Herald-Dispatch".
In 2013, HD Media purchased the Herald-Dispatch from Champion Industries.
"The Herald-Dispatch" was founded in 1909 when two Huntington newspapers, the Herald and the Dispatch, merged.[3] In 1927, the newspaper became a part of the Huntington Publishing Company, operated by Joseph Harvey Long, the owner of the Huntington Advertiser. The company was operated by the Long family until 1971, when it was sold to the Honolulu Star Bulletin and then to the Gannett Company ten months later.[3] Its companion afternoon paper, the Huntington Advertiser, ceased as a separate publication in 1979. Prior to the Huntington Advertiser's demise, the combined Sunday newspaper was referred to as the Herald-Advertiser, correctly depicted in the movie We Are Marshall. Today, it also publishes the Putnam Herald and the Lawrence Herald, more localized editions of The Herald-Dispatch serving Putnam County, West Virginia and Lawrence County, Ohio, respectively.
"Charleston Gazette-Mail".
On March 8, 2018, HD Media, the Herald-Dispatch's holding company, was declared the successful bid in the auction for the Charleston Gazette-Mail after the paper had declared bankruptcy.
"The Charleston Gazette-Mail" is the only daily morning newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia. It is the product of a July 2015 merger between the "Charleston Gazette" and the "Charleston Daily Mail".
The "Gazette" traces its roots to 1873. At the time, it was a weekly newspaper known as the "Kanawha Chronicle". It was later renamed "The Kanawha Gazette" and the "Daily Gazette"—before its name was officially changed to "The Charleston Gazette" in 1907. In 1912 it came under the control of the Chilton family, who have owned it until its bankruptcy in 2018. William E. Chilton, a U.S. senator, was publisher of "The Gazette", as were his son, William E. Chilton II, and grandson, W.E. "Ned" Chilton III, Yale graduate and classmate/protégé of conservative columnist William F. Buckley, Jr.. Ironically, the paper's opinion page, usually on the left, carried Buckley's column until Buckley's death.
Ned Chilton used to claim that the job of a newspaper was to "comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable." The newspaper's liberal reputation was enhanced by principal editorial writer and columnist L.T. Anderson, associate editor and two-time runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize. Anderson later moved to the rival "Daily Mail" as a columnist after he was passed over for an editorial position at the "Gazette", and often used his "Daily Mail" column to snipe at his former employer.
The "Daily Mail" was founded in 1914 by former Alaska Governor Walter Eli Clark and remained the property of his heirs until 1987. Governor Clark described the newspaper as an "independent Republican" publication. In 1987, the Clark heirs sold the paper to the Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers. The new owners moderated the political views of the paper to some degree. In 1998, Thomson sold the Daily Mail to the Denver-based MediaNews Group. The newspaper published in the afternoons, Monday-Saturday, with a Sunday morning edition, until 1961; Monday – Saturday afternoons from 1961–2005, Monday – Friday afternoons from 2005–2009, and Monday – Friday mornings from 2009–2015.
Other papers.
In 2014, "The Herald-Dispatch" parent company HD Media acquired the "Wayne County News" in Wayne, West Virginia. In 2017, HD Media acquired the "Logan Banner", "Williamson Daily News", the "Coal Valley News" in Madison and "The Pineville Independent Herald" in Pineville from Civitas Media.
Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google and Facebook.
In February 2021, HD Media filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google and Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia on the basis of digital advertising manipulation. According to News Media Alliance, this is the first lawsuit of its kind being filed by a news outlet. Managing director Doug Reynolds has stated in an interview that "“These companies are more powerful than Standard Oil in its heyday, so no one wants to be the first to take them on. We felt the political and legal climate have moved in our favor and are ready to go ahead.” Paul Farrell, the lead lawyer for the suit has pointed out the digital advertising revenue of the company has declined despite a growing digital audience. Mr. Reynolds has reportedly spoken with other publishers and expects some will join the suit in the future.

Anthony Acevedo

Anthony Claude Acevedo (July 31, 1924 – February 11, 2018) was a Mexican-American soldier during World War II. He kept a diary while being held at the Berga concentration camp that was instrumental in documenting Nazi atrocities against American prisoners of war. In civilian life, Acevedo worked as an engineer.
Early life.
Acevedo was born in San Bernardino, California, on July 31, 1924, to Francisco Guillermo Acevedo, an engineer from Mexico, and Maria Louisa Contreras (née Limantur) Acevedo. His early education was in San Bernardino, where he attended a local school for non-white students. Anthony's mother died when he was two years of age. Four years after his first wife's death, his father remarried to a woman with an identical name, Maria Louisa Morgan. Acevedo's step-mother was deported to Mexico sometime later; as a result his father moved the family to Durango, Mexico in 1937, In addition, the Great Depression had made finding employment difficult in the United States. Acevedo's father found employment as an engineer in Mexico City with the Pan-American Highway, and eventually became an official for the Federal Mexican Government.
As a teenager, Acevedo and a friend intercepted radio messages sent in Morse code from German agents operating in Mexico to a German submarine in coastal waters. As a result, the agents were captured and tried in court.
Education and draft.
From an early age Acevedo desired to become a physician. Acevedo graduated from Durango Institute of Technology. An American citizen by birthplace, he was summoned by the draft in 1942. Acevedo left Mexico to report for the draft, partly out of American patriotism awakened by the Pearl Harbor bombing, and partly to distance himself from his father. Reporting to an induction center in Pasadena, California, he was informed his Durango schooling was insufficient, so he completed an additional semester.
He was first assigned to Fort MacArthur in California. The Governor of Durango had sent papers informing the U.S. Armed Forces of Acevedo's desire to become a doctor. He was therefore sent to O'Reilly General Hospital to receive medical training. After training he was sent to Camp Adair in Oregon and attached to the 91st Infantry Division. When this unit shipped out to Italy, Acevedo was not amongst them, as he had acquired a case of the measles. Instead, he was reassigned to Company B of the 70th Infantry Division, which was also at Camp Adair. This division was deployed to Marseilles in December 1944, crossing the ocean on the USS "West Point". At this time Acevedo held the rank of Corporal.
Capture and incarceration.
Acevedo was captured during the Battle of the Bulge on January 6, 1945. Initially, Acevedo was sent to the Stalag IX-B prison camp, and he spent a few weeks there. Eventually a Nazi commander arrived and declared that all Jews should step forward. Few did so, and therefore those who "looked like Jews" or appeared otherwise "undesirable" were selected. The Nazis were unfamiliar with Latin Americans, and he was summarily classified as Jewish and sent to the death camp at Berga, designed for American soldiers of Jewish descent. He was shipped by railcar, arriving at Berga on February 8, 1945.
At Berga, he kept a diary which listed in detail the death of each soldier, along with the medical details of the soldiers he looked after, as he felt it was his "moral obligation" as a medic. This diary also recorded notes on every detail of the camp and camp life that Acevedo saw, and he came to view this diary as his "lifeline". He kept the diary secret from the Nazi guards by hiding it variously in his pants or in the barracks. To make his pen last he would mix snow or urine with the ink.
Berga was designed to work the prisoners to death through a program the Nazis called "Vernichtung Durch Arbeit," but Acevedo attempted to keep his fellows alive insofar as possible. He did this by "cooking", adding cats, grass, rats, sand, wood shavings and other material to the of bread they received on some days. He also kept up morale with his genial attitude, mixed with jokes.
Acevedo himself was subject to abuses at the hands of the Gestapo, including being raped as part of his torture. Part of the reason for Acevedo's torture was the role he had played in the capture of German espionage agents when he lived in Mexico as a teenager. On April 23, 1945, the camp was evacuated in the face of the approaching Allied armies. The prisoners were subjected to a death march. Between the camp and the march, fewer than half of the Berga prisoners survived. Acevedo was rescued later that month, weighing only .
In camp, Acevedo received correspondence and care packages from a woman named Maria Dolores. He established a romantic relationship with her, and they became engaged to be married, having never met in person.
Acevedo and other survivors of Berga were instructed to sign a document that swore them to secrecy regarding their experiences at the Nazi camp. The U.S. Army maintains it was to protect escapees and the local populace who helped POWs, but it deeply hurt Acevedo that he was unable to share his experiences.
Postwar.
After the war, Acevedo traveled back to Mexico. On the train ride there he made the acquaintance of Amparo "Chita" Martinez, a young woman who was a neighbor of an army buddy. When he arrived home, Acevedo's father confronted him regarding his relationship with Martinez, in view of Anthony's engagement to Maria Dolores. The argument further escalated when his father accused him of cowardice because he "let himself be captured", and his father further stated that Acevedo should have "killed himself". Acevedo was infuriated and immediately left home, taking his few unpacked belongings, moved back to the United States, and married Martinez. He did not see or speak to his parents for several years. Dolores was deeply hurt by the dissolution of the engagement.
After the war Acevedo worked for a time as a surgical technician, and wished to continue his medical studies with the goal of becoming a medical doctor. This never came to fruition; instead he made a career as a design engineer for McDonnell Douglas, North American Aviation, and the Hughes Aircraft Company.
Acevedo eventually divorced Martinez, and was re-introduced to Dolores through a mutual friend. Acevedo and Dolores married in the 1980s.
Acevedo retired in 1987 and until 2017 he lived in Yucaipa, California. After retirement posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affected him considerably; he would wake up sweating and screaming in the middle of the night among other effects. The bulk of his retirement was spent volunteering at Veterans Affairs hospitals to assist patients with PTSD, in part to help himself cope with the same issues.
Dolores Acevedo died in 2014. The last year of Acevedo's life was spent living with family members in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Acevedo died on February 11, 2018 at the Loma Linda Veterans Affairs Medical Center of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Personal life and beliefs.
Acevedo had two sisters and three brothers between his father's two marriages. He recalled his childhood as abusive, having received abuse from his father and from his nanny, but believed this experience gave him the strength to survive the Nazi death-camp.
He and his first wife Chita had three boys and one girl. Acevedo practiced the Roman Catholic faith. His main interests included barbecuing, reading books about World War II, and spending time with his family. He believed that the US Government intentionally covered up the abuse of Americans at Berga, and that this action significantly added to the affected soldiers' suffering. When the government finally did give official recognition, Acevedo refused to attend as it was held in Orlando instead of Washington D.C.
Although his treatment by the United States was often less than optimal, throughout his life he was highly patriotic towards the country he had served. He identified with US conservative politics, but felt betrayed by later conservative stances on immigration, stating, "They don't know shit from Shinola". When one of his sons discovered his Armed Forces psychiatric evaluation a few months before his death, he also found out that his father had been raped by the Nazis. Acevedo was glad about the discovery, saying, "I'm glad you found it... I want you to tell everyone what I went through and how I struggled with the nightmares" so mankind could see "this is how low man can get". In truth, this horrific event was disclosed years earlier to his eldest son Anthony F Acevedo but did not reveal it to anyone until recently. The subject matter was too sensitive to discuss openly and preferred to keep it concealed. This included family members. Despite all, Acevedo advocated forgiveness, peace, and love towards humanity.
Legacy.
On June 1, 2004, Acevedo was recognized in the United States House of Representatives by Joe Baca, who cited Acevedo's patriotism and forbearance, calling him a "symbol of all that we, as Americans, strive to be". In 2008, an investigative report by CNN based on interviews with Acevedo was the catalyst for the U.S. government to finally acknowledge the experiences of the American soldiers held in the Berga concentration camp. Accordingly, Maj. Gen. Vincent E. Boles met with some of the Berga survivors to honor them with flags flown over The Pentagon a few months later.
Acevedo's Berga diary is housed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the first such document created by an American captive to be included. The museum also took oral history from Acevedo in both English and Spanish. He became the first Mexican-American to be registered, in 2010, as a survivor at the museum's database. His personal experiences enhanced Mexican-American understanding of the Holocaust.

Euproctis lunata

Euproctis lunata, the castor hairy caterpillar, is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Francis Walker in 1855. It is found in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
The wingspan of the male is 30–32 mm and the female's wingspan is 35–37 mm. Antennae of male bipectinate (comb like on both sides) whereas female has filiform (thread-like) antennae. Male is about 10–12 mm in length and female is 12–14 mm in length. Pupa light reddish brown.
Bionomics.
The caterpillar is known to feed on "Ricinus communis", "Acacia nilotica", "Tamarindus indica", "Nerium oleander", "Chrysanthemum", "Moringa oleifera", "Ziziphus mauritiana", "Cinnamomum camphora", "Terminalia tomentosa", "Erythrina fusca", "Erythrina variegata", "Eugenia", "Mangifera indica", "Manihot esculenta", "Morus", "Pithecellobium dulce", "Sesbania grandiflora", "Terminalia tomentosa", "Ziziphus jujuba" and "Ziziphus mauritiana". and recently from "Sesbania sesban".
During February and March 2002, a severe outbreak of castor hairy caterpillar was observed on acacia trees in Thailakulam, Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, India. Larval swarms persisted for 10 to 15 days in vegetation and were a nuisance to the environment and surrounding villages. A hymenopteran "Aholcus euproctiscidis" is an egg parasite of the castor hairy caterpillar.

Elizabeth Pennington

Elizabeth Pennington (1732–1759) was an English poet. Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, she formed an early friendship with the fellow poet Martha Ferrar, a life-long friend who was the chief beneficiary of her will. During her life she formed friendships with Frances Sheridan and Samuel Richardson, and was praised by John Dunton in his poetic roll call of women writers, "The Feminiad" (1754). The poems Dunton was familiar with must have circulated in manuscript. Her three poems that survive were posthumously published: 'Ode to a Thrush', 'Ode to Morning' and 'The Copper Farthing'. All three became anthology pieces, and were published in collections such as "Specimens of British Poetesses" (1798) and "Poems of Eminent Ladies" (1780).
Her poetry makes effective use of the burlesque mode, and shows the influence of John Philips's "The Splendid Shilling". Her entry in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" notes that her 'ability to write in a learned and heroic style, despite her limited opportunity for education, is remarkable'.

LKL II

The LKL II was a Polish three-seat competitive touring aircraft first flown in 1930.
Design and development.
The LKL II was the first aircraft built in the workshop of the Lubelski Klub Lotniczy (LKL) and was intended to compete in the 1930 Second Challenge de Tourisme International. Two examples of the three-seat cabin monoplane were built together, starting in the summer of 1929 and completed the following year with a first flight in July 1930 flown by Jozef Zuromski. The second airframe was destroyed by fire during its first take-off attempt.
The LKL II was a high, cantilever wing aircraft of mixed construction which had a one-piece, two spar wooden wing with plywood covering, elliptical in plan and bolted directly on the top of the welded steel tube fuselage structure. It was powered by a Walter Vega five-cylinder radial engine, mounted with its cylinders exposed for cooling. Behind the engine the fuselage was fabric covered. Its large, enclosed cabin had a bench seat for two passengers behind the pilot and a luggage compartment at the rear. Entry was via a starboard side door.
Its empenage was a steel tube structure with fabric covering. The fin was triangular and carried a deep semi-circular rudder which worked between the elevators. Its tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and was adjustable.
The LKL II had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheeels on streamlined struts hinged on the lower longerons. These joined rubber shock absorbers placed within the fuselage. 
Operational history.
The loss of the second airframe slowed the development of the first, preventing it from participating in the Challenge but it was later much used by the LKL, taking part in several later contests. It came fifth in the first Lublinian-Podlasian competition early in 1931 and seventh out of twenty-two in the Fourth National Lightplane Contest in September 1931, on both occasions flown by Zuromski. It continued to take part in local events through 1932 until it was retired in 1934.
Bartolewski and Teisseyre considered an ambulance development of the LKL II and also studied and perhaps began to build the LKL III, which would have had a cleaned-up fuselage and a more powerful engine, but neither proposal generated sufficient funding to complete them.

Ben Jones (co-operator)

Benjamin Jones (9 September 1847 – 2 March 1942) was a British co-operative and political activist.
Born in Salford, Jones left school at the age of nine to work for a cabinet maker. While working as an errand boy, he studied at Owens College and the Manchester Mechanics' Institute, and managed to gain promotion to become a book-keeper. In 1866 was appointed as assistant book-keeper to the Manchester Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). In his spare time, he sat on the committee of the Mechanics Institute, and was a Sunday school teacher in Harpurhey. In 1870 he married Annie White, who was later active in the Co-operative Women's Guild, and died in 1894.
Jones was again promoted in 1871, becoming an assistant buyer for the CWS, and in 1874 he was made the founding general manager of the CWS's first London branch, based on Minories. At the same time, he was made honorary secretary of the Co-operative Union's southern board. Under his leadership, the shop proved successful, and in 1887 moved to larger premises on Leman Street. From a turnover of £130,000 in 1875, business grew to £3.25 million in 1902.
Jones remained interested in education, working with Arthur Dyke Acland to produce "Working Men Co-operators", a textbook which remained in print until the 1940s. He was also the first chair of the London branch of the Co-operative Printing Society, founder of the Tenant Co-operators' Association, first secretary of the Co-operative Guild, and president of the Co-operative Congress in 1896, and for one day in 1889.
In 1894, Jones stood down from his southern Co-operative Union post. He remained very active in the movement, and in 1896 embarked on a world tour on behalf of the CWS, along with J. Clay and W. Stoker. A supporter of co-operative production, he was a leading figure in the establishment of a CWS flour mill in Silvertown, cocoa works in Luton and depots around the country.
Jones was also interested in the Parliamentary representation of the co-operative movement. He was the first secretary of the parliamentary committee of the Co-operative Union, and was also active in the Labour Representation League. He stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Woolwich at the 1892 and 1895 general elections, with the backing of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. At the 1900 general election, he instead stood in Deptford, but was again unsuccessful.
Jones retired to Bournemouth in 1902, purchasing the Queen Hotel, a bakery and some cafes. He wrote an autobiography, "Life According to Jones", which was published in 1918, and various press articles on co-operative matters.
He died in Bournemouth on 2 March 1942 aged 94 and was survived by his four children.

Elisabeth van Dedem Lecky

Elisabeth van Dedem Lecky (15 April 1842 – 23 May 1912; née Catharina Elisabeth Boldewina Baroness van Dedem) was a Dutch-Irish writer, historian and suffragist.
Background.
Elisabeth Lecky van Dedem was born in Deventer, Netherlands. She was a member of the Dutch aristocratic family, who were prominent in the industrial development of the Netherlands. Her parents were lieutenant general Willem Karel Jan baron van Dedem and Anna Philippina Catharina baroness Sloet van Hagensdorp. Her brother was the lawyer and politician Willem Karel van Dedem. In her youth she served as lady-in-waiting to Sophie of Württemberg.
In 1871, she married William Edward Hartpole Lecky, an Irish historian, essayist, political theorist, and provost of Trinity College Dublin. 
She endowed the Lecky Chair of History at Trinity College, Dublin in her husband's honour.
Her husband's mother, Isabella Wilmot, was the niece of early nineteenth-century travellers Martha and Katherine Wilmot. Lecky formed a friendship with Martha's daughter, Catherine Anne Daschkaw Brooke (née Bradford, and named after the sisters' host Princess Dashkova), who bequeathed her several of the Wilmot sisters' manuscripts. Lecky donated these manuscripts to the Royal Irish Academy in 1903, which now form the Library's Wilmot-Dashkova Collection.
Career.
Lecky was a prolific writer, contributing travel writing, political essays and editorial commentary to English periodicals including the "British Medical Journal", "The Nineteenth Century", and "Living Age".
She actively campaigned for human rights. She joined prominent suffragists in petitioning for the extension of Parliamentary suffrage alongside Millicent Fawcett and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in 1897. She raised funds and agitated on behalf of the Irish Distressed Ladies Fund, as well as for the higher education of women in Ireland through her support of Alexandria College, Dublin.
Lecky also engaged in biographical and historical writing. In 1900, she edited and introduced the military autobiography of her ancestor, . Following her husband William Lecky's death she wrote his biography, "A Memoir of the Right Honourable William Edward Hartpole Lecky, Member of the French Institute and of the British Academy" (1909), and edited a posthumous collection of his essays, "Historical and Political Essays" (1908).

Stony Creek Village Historic District

The Stony Creek Village Historic District is a rural, agricultural historic district located on Washington Road in Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
History.
In 1823, Lemuel Taylor moved from New York state to settle on a 400-acre parcel of land at this location on Stony Creek. He built a dam and gristmill, which opened in 1824 and provided a base for a small community. By 1825, the village had a blacksmith, distillery, store, and post office. A hotel was built in the 1830s. A woolen mill was built just after the Civil War, but the industrial and commercial growth of the village was limited, in large part due to the proximity of the much larger city of Rochester.
One of the important families in Stony Creek were the Van Hoosens, who arrived in the 1830s, with then-six-year old Joshua Van Hoosen. In 1851, Joshua purchased part of the farm, then went to California to make his fortune during the gold rush. He returned in 1853, purchased the remaining interest in the farm, and married Sarah Taylor, Lemuel Taylor's daughter. By 1880, Joshua Van Hoosen owned nearly 300 acres of land in the vicinity. Joshua's granddaughter, Sarah Van Hoosen Jones, was born in 1881; Joshua died three years later and the family farm was eventually passed on to Sarah. She continued farming the area, and in 1921 received a Ph.D. in animal genetics, which led her to raise herds of prize dairy cattle. Jones donated the farm to Michigan State University upon her death in 1972. The University donated the Van Hoosen Farmhouse and three acres to Avon Township, and in 1989, the City of Rochester Hills acquired the Van Hoosen Farm buildings and 13 surrounding acres. It is now a museum operated by the city.
Description.
The Stony Creek Village Historic District consists of 17 houses with their associated outbuildings. Probably all of the residences are of pre-Civil War construction, and most are originally of a Greek Revival style. The houses are arranged on and around a center plat with streets on all sides. Probably the most notable among the farm buildings are the large dairy barns and silos of Sarah Van Hoosen Jones, who also owned most of the land in the village.

Overdinkel

Overdinkel is a village in the Twente region of the eastern Netherlands, in the municipality of Losser. It is named for the nearby river Dinkel. Its population in 2012 was 4,255. The territories of the Netherlands and the German "Länder" of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony meet at a point to the east of Overdinkel.
History.
Overdinkel, previously a small farming community in a "solitary plain of heather and sand drifts", was developed in the early 20th century to house workers in the textile factories of Gronau. People from all over the Netherlands and from Germany came to live there. Since the Second World War the textile industry in the region has been in decline, and the village population is forecast also to decline, even though the hospitality industry has grown owing to the proximity of the German border. Overdinkel houses a community of Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, founded in 1919.
Local facilities.
The village is reached by bus from Almelo and Oldenzaal railway stations. There are Roman Catholic and Dutch Reformed churches. Its cultural venue and community centre is known as "t Trefhuus" (before 2016, "Kulturhus").

Sun Meiyao

Sun Meiyao (simplified Chinese: 孙美瑶; traditional Chinese: 孫美瑤; pinyin: "Sūn Měiyáo;" 1898 - 19 December 1923) leader of the Shandong Autonomous Army (山東自治軍: pinyin; "Shāndōng zìzhì jūn"), also known as the Shandong Outlaws (山東響馬), a group of bandits operating in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong provinces in the early 1920s. He is most famous for leading his bandits in the seizure and robbery of the "Blue Express" train near the town of Lincheng on 6 May 1923, and taking over 300 hostages, including 30 westerners. The incident, which became known as the Lincheng Outrage, embarrassed China's fragile republican government, forcing it to respond to demands of western governments that it increase security along the country's extensive rail network and pay compensation and indemnities to western hostages.
Early life.
Sun Meiyao was born in 1898 in Zaozhuang, Shandong province to a well off family. On 15 July 1922 he inherited the leadership of the Shandong Autonomous Army after his older brother Sun Meizhu (1883-1922) was captured in combat with government troops and shot. Sun Meizhu, a renowned scholar in the Shandong area, founded the group in 1920 to protect against constant persecution from warlord generals and China's central government as well as the general lawlessness that prevailed at the time. The army was one of many such bandit groups made up of itinerant discharged and expelled soldiers, in this case mostly former soldiers under Zhang Jingyao, that operated in areas outside of the control of China's central republican government. They supported themselves by plundering the local countryside, robbery, and hostage taking. Explaining his motives Sun said "...we have hitherto been law abiding citizens, and that we have no desire to become robbers; but in this troubled era of unreliable government we find ourselves compelled to take risks in order to obtain redress for our grievances" 
Lincheng Outrage.
In the early hours of 6 May 1923, Sun's twelve hundred bandits attacked and then derailed the "Blue Express" near the town of Lincheng (Xuecheng) on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Hebei Province close to the Jiangsu-Shandong border. The bandits looted the train and killed a number of Chinese passengers as well as a British subject, Joseph Rothman after he refused to surrender his valuables. They took 300 passengers hostage, including 30 westerners, most of whom were Americans, but also included British, French, Italian, German, and Danish nationals, and forced them on a 10-day march to their mountain base at Baodugu. Some of the more prominent hostages included Lucy Aldrich, eldest daughter of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and sister-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr. J. B. Powell, editor of "China Weekly Review," and Commodore Guiseppe Musso, a wealthy and influential Italian who was the chief attorney in the Shanghai French Concession.
Sun led negotiations with intermediaries that included he U.S. Minister to China Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman and American China hand Roy Scott Anderson. Sun's demand included the removal of government troops from Shandong, an official pardon for the kidnappers, reinstatement or enrollment into the army for those among the bandits who wished it, and guarantees by six foreign powers that the demands would be met. As a gesture of good faith, the women were released within a couple of days of the kidnapping, while the remaining male hostages were held for over a month as negotiations dragged on. Ultimately the Shanghai Green Gang leader Du Yuesheng secured the release of the remaining hostages on June 12, 1923 with an $85,000 ransom along with the Chinese government's agreement to accept bandits who wanted it into the military. Many bandits understood the dangers of joining the military and declined. Sun Meiyao and other leaders even received military commissions.
Death.
Over the next six months, the bandits who were inducted into the military were refused weapons and pay, and encouraged to live off the surrounding countryside. Most were killed before the end of the year. Sun was executed six months later on December 19, 1923 at the Zhongxing coal mine by General Zhang Peiyuan, on orders of the new Shandong governor Zheng Shiqi, who had accused Sun of failing to turn over guns and ammunition captured from bandits and of illicitly communicating with the bandit Lao Yangren with the intention of returning to banditry.

Moose goes to Dunbar's house and tries to give him a letter while also begging him for an autograph. Dunbar confronts Moose, threatening him with violence, and tells him to stay out of his neighborhood. Moose comes back again and climbs a fence, but is scared off by Dunbar's housekeeper. Moose keeps returning and eventually gains entry to the house after accidentally pushing the housekeeper into a stone fountain, inadvertently killing her. Moose is again rejected by Dunbar, who calls Moose a stalker and says he'll kill him if he sees him again.
The experience causes Moose to suffer a complete mental breakdown, and he returns and ties up Dunbar in his bed. When Dunbar wakes up, he sees Moose lying on the floor, appearing to have killed himself, only for Moose to start laughing and get up. Next, Moose dresses up in a Jason Voorhees mask and pretends to stab Dunbar, but his blade is revealed to be a retractable prop knife. A terrified Dunbar pleads for Moose to untie him with promises of autographs and friendship, and he does. Dunbar attacks and nearly kills Moose, shooting off his fingers with a hidden rifle and stabbing him in the eye. Moose starts to cry hysterically and after a seeming change of heart, Dunbar calmly escorts him out of his home. 
Moose wanders the streets of Hollywood, sobbing and passing tourists who request to take photos with him, believing his wounds to be a part of a realistic costume, before Leah finds him and takes him to a hospital. Meanwhile, Dunbar is seen being arrested after police, having been informed of his assault on Moose, find the dead housekeeper and mistakenly assume Dunbar killed her.

Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 16% based on 68 reviews, with an average score of 3.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "John Travolta gives it his oddly coiffed all, but "The Fanatic" rings hollow as an examination of the way fan appreciation can curdle into toxic obsession." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".
NPR's Simon Abrams gave the film a negative review, calling it a noticeable downgrade from "The Education of Charlie Banks" and "The Longshots", and labeling the work a "miserable psychodrama". Specific elements attracting criticism included the "cliché-filled voiceover narration" and "a bunch of scenes where Travolta zealously overacts". Glenn Kenny of "The New York Times" also wrote a negative review of the film, arguing that it "delineates the border that separates the merely stale from the genuinely rancid."
In a positive review, Josh Millican of Dread Central called the film "a riveting indie with genuine suspense", and he praised both Travolta's and Sawa's performances.
Accolades.
The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Picture, Worst Director (Fred Durst), and Worst Actor which John Travolta won (also for his performance in "Trading Paint").

The Jan Van Loon House (, like "van loan") is one of the oldest extant buildings in New York State. It is located in Athens, New York at 39 South Washington Street (also known as New York State Route 385). It is inside the Village of Athens Multiple Resource Area (MRA) and the Athens Lower Village Historic District. It was built by Jan Van Loon, who fathered eight children including Albertus Van Loon. Van Loon was a blacksmith by trade, but was also known to work in silver.
Van Loon was the earliest European settler to the area, purchasing the land in 1685. In 1688 he then gave the settlement its first name, Loonenburg. Only one wall of the original 1706 structure remains unchanged in the house.
Jan's grandchild, John M. Van Loon, sold the family lands on 30 April 1800 to Isaac Northrup, who then developed them into a more complete village.
In 1932, the New York State Education Department placed a historic marker outside the house:

William Maxwell (co-operator)

Sir William Maxwell (30 November 1841 – 9 February 1929) was a Scottish co-operative activist.
Born in Glasgow, Maxwell largely grew up in Paisley, but returned to Glasgow when he was ten, and became an apprentice coachbuilder two years later. He successfully completed the apprenticeship, having also studied in his spare time at the Glasgow School of Design, and travelled around the country, looking for work.
By the mid-1860s, Maxwell had returned to Glasgow, where he became active in the local trade union movement. He moved to Edinburgh early in the 1870s, and there he became active in the St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society. In 1878, he was elected as its secretary, serving for four years. This led him to prominence in the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS), serving on its board from 1880, and as president from 1908 onwards.
Maxwell was interested in co-operative production, and visited the United States in 1884 to study developments there. On his return to Scotland, he led the construction of a series of factories in Shieldhall, making goods for the SCWS. He served repeatedly as president of the Co-operative Congress, and in 1907 became president of the International Co-operative Alliance, serving until 1921.
Maxwell was also interested in the political representation of the co-operative movement, and he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Glasgow Tradeston at the 1900 UK general election. In 1910, he wrote the "History of Co-operation in Scotland". He was knighted in 1919, and retired from all his posts two years later, due to poor health. He relocated to Rothesay, where he lived until his death in 1929.

PRhyme is an American hip hop duo composed of Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9" and New York-based record producer DJ Premier. They created their own record label PRhyme Records and released their first album, "PRhyme", on December 9, 2014, and its follow-up, "PRhyme 2", on March 16, 2018. The production of each album is based on sampling a single artist's compositions: Adrian Younge for "PRhyme" and AntMan Wonder for "PRhyme 2". When the concept was originally pitched to Premier, he viewed it as a challenge since he recognized that he was previously known for his beats from obscure samples from many different sources, and this project forced him to find what he needed from a single catalogue of work. For "PRhyme 2", Royce described the process of receiving compositions to work off of directly from AntMan Wonder as being "like sampling from Mozart but Mozart is actually giving you the music". The duo also appeared on the "Southpaw" soundtrack.

Ann Bathurst

Ann Bathurst was a prophet and member of the 17th century English dissenter group, the Philadelphian Society. Not much is known of Bathurst's family, and what is known is due to her two-volume manuscript diary covering the period 1679 to 1696. This diary is held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It appears that Bathurst came from a religious background, and her diary begins with an autobiographical account that describes family prayer and Bible reading.
By 1697, the Philadelphians met at Bathurst's house in Baldwin Gardens, London every Sunday, where she lived with Joanna Openbridge. This group are known to have held millennialist views, and Bathurst produced prophetic visions that resulted in a 'lyrical, woman-inclusive representation of mystical theology'. She was considered as a possible successor to Jane Leade who led the group until her death in 1704. This was prevented by Bathurst's own death at around the same time.

Payne Lindsey

Payne Lindsey is an American director, documentary filmmaker, and podcast host. He is best known for co-creating and hosting the hit investigative journalist and true crime podcasts "Up and Vanished" and "Atlanta Monster".
Early life.
Lindsey was born and raised in Kennesaw, Georgia. He obtained his first video camera at age 10 and later directed local television commercials and music videos. As a child, he wanted to direct feature films. Lindsey made a 13-minute documentary film about people that he met on a cross-country road trip and entered it into festivals. He attended college on and off for a few years, but hated school. At age 23, his dad cut him off and he began focusing on creating and directing videos.
Career.
"Up and Vanished".
In December 2015, Netflix released "Making a Murderer". Lindsey watched the show and realized that he wanted to do something similar. With an early interest in investigative journalism, Lindsey was inspired to investigate the disappearance of beauty queen and school teacher Tara Grinstead, a well-known cold case in Georgia. At the time, Lindsey's intentions were to develop Grinstead's story into a documentary film, but he realized he did not have the funds to film interviews on location. Lindsey realized that he "could produce a podcast at home in my boxers," and created "Up and Vanished". Lindsey did not have access to police files, so instead scoured through old news articles and online forums to hunt out possible leads. Lindsey's grandmother lived in Tifton, Georgia, near Ocilla, where Grinstead had gone missing. Lindsey broadcast in real-time, week by week, in audio form. Within a 12-month period the podcast received over 50 million downloads, which propelled Grinstead's case into the mainstream media. This helped uncover previously unnoticed evidence which lead to the decade-old case being cracked and two arrests made. Lindsey began podcasting full time once "Up and Vanished" increased in popularity. A second season of "Up and Vanished" covered the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger.
Tenderfoot TV.
After "Up and Vanished", together with his business partner Donald Albright, Lindsey launched the content creation company Tenderfoot TV which is based in Atlanta. Together with Tenderfoot TV and Oxygen Lindsey and Albright developed a TV docu-series from "Up and Vanished". As of January 2020, Oxygen and Tenderfoot TV are working to develop a television special about Kristal Reisinger which will be produced by Lindsey.
In addition to "Up and Vanished" and "Atlanta Monster", Tenderfoot TV also produced the podcasts "To Live and Die in L.A.", "Culpable", and "Somebody". Meredith Stedman is the Creative Producer at the company. As of June 2019, the company had over 400 million total downloads for its podcasts. Tenderfoot TV is represented by United Talent Agency.
"Atlanta Monster".
In early 2018, in partnership with HowStuffWorks, Lindsey launched "Atlanta Monster", a new podcast about the infamous Atlanta Child Murders, which occurred between 1979 - 1981 with over 25 victims murdered in Atlanta. Lindsey had never heard of the case until his business partner, Donald Albright, told him about the murders. Lindsey hosted the podcast and conducted the interviews featured on the podcast. The podcast had over 70 million downloads.
"Radio Rental".
In fall 2019, Payne Lindsey announced and released the first episode of a new podcast that features true stories with a fictional backdrop, "Radio Rental". Lindsey asked Atlanta citizens to reach out and share the paranormal and scary stories to share on the podcast. The podcast is hosted by a fictional character, a 1980s-era video store employee named Terry Carnation. Carnation is played by Rainn Wilson. Lindsey and Wilson connected after Wilson tweeted that he loved Lindsey's podcast, "Atlanta Monster".
Personal life.
Lindsey is from Georgia and resides in Atlanta. In September 2016, Lindsey married Cassie House. According to the "Up and Vanished" website, Lindsey has a brother, Mason Lindsey, who works as a producer for Tenderfoot TV. He is the cousin of 98.5 The Sports Hub radio host Rich Shertenlieb.

St Louis (1919 – after 1933) was an Irish-bred, British-trained thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He finished unplaced on his only start as a juvenile but made rapid improvement over the winter and won the 2000 Guineas in April 1922. He finished fourth when favourite for the Epsom Derby and then won a minor race at Wolverhampton Racecourse but was withdrawn from the St Leger after running poorly in a trial race. After failing to win on his only run as a four-year-old he was retired to stud, but had no success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
St Louis was a "grand" bay horse with a white blaze bred at the Confey Stud in County Dublin by J J Maher. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 2,600 guineas by the trainer Peter Gilpin on behalf of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough. Gilpin trained the horse at his Clarehaven stable in Newmarket, Suffolk.
He was one of the best horses sired by Louvois who won the 2000 Guineas and was awarded second place in the Derby in 1913. St Louis's dam Princess Sterling was an influential broodmare whose female-line descendants included Noblesse who was in turn the ancestor of Rainbow Quest, Warning and Commander in Chief.
Racing career.
1921: two-year-old season.
St Louis made only one appearance on the track as a two-year-old and made little impression as he finished unplaced in a minor race.
1922: three-year-old season.
Ridden by the American jockey George Archibald, St Louis stated at odds of 6/1 in a 22-runner field for the 114th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 April. Racing on soft ground he took the lead from Captain Cuttle in the final furlong and drew away to win easily by three lengths from Solomon Joel's Pondoland with the fading Captain Cuttle four lengths back in third. Lord Queenborough donated £200 of the prize money to two racing charities, namely the Rous Memorial Fund and the Bentinck Benevolent Fund. St Louis's success saw him elevated to favouritism for the Epsom Derby. On 29 May St Louis started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles put appeared to be unsuited by the firmer ground and finished fourth behind Captain Cuttle, Tamar and Craigangower.
St Louis was off the course until August, when he started at odds of 1/9 against four moderate opponents in the Wolverhampton Breeder's Foal Plate over ten furlongs. With Archibald in the saddle he won very easily by five lengths from Clincher, to whom he was conceding 20 pounds in weight.
The colt was strongly fancied for the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September, but in his final prep race he came home last of the three runners behind Express Delivery in the Great Yorkshire Stakes over one and a half mile at York, and was withdrawn from the Leger a few days later.
St Louis's earnings of £11,084 for the year made him the fifth most successful racehorse of the season.
1923: four-year-old season.
St Louis remained in training but was beaten on his only start. When he was put up for auction at the end of the year he failed to reach his reserve price of 4,200 guineas and was retained by his owner.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated St Louis a "poor" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
St Louis was retired to become a breeding stallion at Lord Queenborough's Snarehill Stud in Norfolk. He sired no major winners and his last reported foals were born in 1933.

The Chamber (2016 film)

The Chamber is a 2016 survival film about four people trapped in a submersible at the bottom of the ocean. The film is directed by Ben Parker in his directorial debut, and it stars Johannes Bah Kuhnke, Charlotte Salt, James McArdle, and Elliot Levey.
Critical reception.
The film review aggregator website Metacritic collected five reviews and assessed four as mixed and one as negative. Based on the reviews, the website gave the film a score of 40 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Drone.
Director Ben Parker said of the drone's inclusion, "A drone that crashed in the ocean was where the kernel of the story came from. I’ve always been fascinated, or rather terrified, by drones... The disconnect of using unmanned aircraft for attacks is something that scares me. And "The Chamber" was really about all my darkest fears rolled into one, so I wanted the plot to revolve around the recovery of one of these drones."

Bloodshot (film)

Bloodshot is a 2020 American superhero film based on the Valiant Comics character of the same name. It is intended to be the first installment in a series of films set within a Valiant Comics shared cinematic universe. Directed by David S. F. Wilson (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer and a story by Wadlow, the film stars Vin Diesel, Eiza González, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbell, and Guy Pearce. It follows a soldier who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon.
"Bloodshot" was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film grossed $37 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically.
Plot.
After leading a successful rescue operation of hostages in Mombasa, U.S. soldier, Ray Garrison, and his wife, Gina, travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the Amalfi Coast. They are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know how the US military learned about the hostages and their location. When Ray explains that he cannot answer, as he isn't privy to that sort information, Axe executes Gina in front of him. Ray vows revenge, and Axe kills Ray as well.
An amnesiac Ray awakens in the labs of Rising Spirit Technologies (RST), a company in Kuala Lumpur specializing in cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. CEO and lead scientist, Dr. Emil Harting, tells Ray he is the first successful human subject of the "Bloodshot" program, resurrecting and healing him through the injection of experimental nanite technology now replacing his entire bloodstream. This technology increases his strength and heals his injuries, but the nanites need to be regularly replaced and recharged or he will eventually succumb to damage and die again. When the nanites work at extreme power, they create a red glowing circle of light on Ray's chest.
Ray is introduced to Dr. Harting's other patients, including former US Navy diver "KT" (with whom Ray strikes up a friendship), former U.S. Army Ranger Marcus Tibbs, and ex-Navy SEAL Jimmy Dalton (who overtly—maybe even jealously—dislikes Garrison). After experiencing flashbacks of Gina and Axe, he leaves to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites and RST servers to hack into databases, Ray tracks down Axe to Budapest and kills him along with his bodyguards. Back at RST, Ray is put to sleep as his nanites are rebooted. As he has done many times before, Harting then replaces Ray's memories with a new scenario of how Gina died, this time with Axe's associate, Nick Baris, as the culprit. KT objects to Harting repeatedly manipulating Ray's memories so he will go after different targets without question or remorse, but she is ignored and reminded that RST can kill her by deactivating her enhancements.
Ray awakens, once again amnesiac, and is re-introduced to RST, then experiences flashbacks of Baris kidnapping and killing him and Gina. Driven by revenge, he tracks Baris to East Sussex and kills him, despite the man pleading that RST is lying. Wilfred Wigans, a programmer forced to work for Baris, activates an EMP bomb that incapacitates Ray and severs his link with RST. Ray awakens in Wigans's office and experiences multiple contradicting memories of who killed Gina. Wigans helps him realize RST has been manipulating him so he would kill the company's enemies and rivals. Ray tracks down Gina, not only learning she is actually still alive but that their relationship ended five years ago, and since then, she has started a new family in London.
Harting sends KT after Wigans, but after KT asks Wigans for help in freeing herself from RST control and taking down the corporation, she returns to RST and tells Harting she failed to capture the programmer. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs and brought back to the laboratory. KT and Wigans sabotage the reprogramming process and destroy the RST computers. Ray awakens and Dalton and Tibbs try to subdue him. After a lengthy battle, he kills them as the RST building crumbles. Harting confronts Ray with a grenade launcher, confident that the soldier will surrender now that his nanites have been exhausted. To his surprise, Ray is willing to die to achieve victory and activates a grenade that the nanites deconstructed, fatally wounding them both. Ray later awakes with his full memories, revived by Wigans who has updated his technology so his nanites are self-sufficient. The two men and KT then leave in search of a new life.
Production.
Development.
In March 2015, it was announced that Columbia Pictures had acquired the film rights to the Valiant Comics character Bloodshot, which would be produced by Original Film and Valiant Entertainment. Jeff Wadlow was hired to write the screenplay. In April 2015, Sony Pictures, Original Film and Valiant announced a five-picture deal to bring Valiant Comics' superheroes to the big screen, including Bloodshot. Chad Stahelski and David Leitch were hired to direct the film, from a screenplay by Wadlow and Eric Heisserer. Stahelski and Leitch eventually passed on the project. In March 2017, Dave Wilson was announced as the director of the film. Screenwriter Adam Cozad later contributed to the script.
Casting.
In July 2017, it was reported that Jared Leto was in early negotiations to star in the film as Bloodshot, but in March 2018, it was announced that Vin Diesel would portray the main character. By May, additional cast members were announced, with Sam Heughan, Michael Sheen, and Eiza González. In June of the same year, Talulah Riley and Alex Hernandez were cast in the film to play the titular characters' wife named Gina, and member of a scientist team named Tibbs, respectively. Later, Toby Kebbell and Johannes Haukur Johannesson were both cast in villainous roles, with the former playing Axe. In August 2018, Lamorne Morris was hired to play a young scientist named Wilfred Wigans. In the same month, it was reported that Guy Pearce was in talks to replace Sheen, who had to exit the movie due to scheduling and family conflicts. In an interview for Inverse , Shamdasani, the longtime Valiant Comics publisher's CEO and Chief Creative Officer, told that Ken Watanabe would play the Harbinger villain Toyo Harada in a post credit scene . But because of the change of copyright of the film Harbinger to Paramount it was not possible to film the cameo.
Filming.
Principal photography began on August 6, 2018 in Cape Town, South Africa, and in Prague, Czech Republic, with other filming taking place in Budapest, Hungary in that same month. Filming officially wrapped on October 25, 2018.
Release.
"Bloodshot" was released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing, after previously being scheduled to release on February 21, 2020. It also opened in the UK, Ireland, India, and Spain on the same day.
On March 18, Sony Pictures confirmed that due to movie theater closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the film would be released digitally through Premium VOD in the United States and Canada on March 24, 2020. This was just two weeks after the film's theatrical debut and before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. Over its first three days of home release, "Bloodshot" was the most watched on Amazon Prime and fourth-most on iTunes. Despite the pandemic's affects on the film's box office return, "Bloodshot" was ranked number one on Digital Entertainment Group's "Watched at Home Top 20" list for the week ending May 9, 2020.
As the pandemic receded, the film was released in three Santikos Theatres locations in San Antonio, Texas on May 1, 2020. In China, the film was released on July 24, 2020. In August 2020, AMC Theatres announced that the film would resume showing in theaters upon their reopening that month.
Reception.
Box office.
"Bloodshot" grossed $10 million in the United States and Canada, and $27.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $37.1 million, against a production budget of $45 million.
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside "The Hunt" and "I Still Believe", and was projected to gross around $10 million from 2,861 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $3.8 million on its first day, including $1.2 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $9.3 million, finishing third. The weekend was also noteworthy for being the lowest combined-grossing since October 1998, with all films totaling just $55.3 million, in large part from societal restrictions and regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the film's second weekend, due to the mass theater closures around the country, the film made $52,000 from 79 locations, mostly drive-in theaters.
After months of delays, the film was released in China on July 24, and made $2.8 million in its opening weekend.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads: ""Bloodshot" gives Vin Diesel a solid opportunity to indulge in old-school action that should satisfy fans, even if the end result is disappointingly mediocre." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while filmgoers at PostTrak gave the film an average 3 out of 5 stars, with 45% saying they would definitely recommend it.
Owen Gleiberman of "Variety" wrote: ""Bloodshot" is a trash compactor of a comic-book film, but it's smart trash, an action matrix that’s fun to plug into." Justin Lowe of "The Hollywood Reporter" gave the film a mixed review, saying "[director] Wilson acquits himself adequately enough, emphasizing pacing over character development, but delivering a series of kinetically propelled scenes that clearly benefit from his extensive visual effects experience." Richard Roeper of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it ambitious but "intermittently entertaining" and "frantically overcooked, bursting with headache-inducing, rapid-cut action sequences".
Angelica Jade Bastien at Vulture.com was critical of Diesel's performance: "At this point, what could have been a passably entertaining diversion, the kind of film best enjoyed overcoming a hangover or while folding laundry, falls flat on Diesel's lips. He lacks the gravitas of delivery, disinterested in his lines even before he finishes saying them." Joshua Rivera of "The Verge" wrote: "As an action movie, "Bloodshot" is the worst kind of uninspiring: not bad enough to circle back around toward fun, not good enough at action to be even momentarily impressed by a fight scene." Odie Henderson at RogerEbert.com called it a ""Universal Soldier" rip-off", and hoped there would not be any sequels.
Future.
Intended to be the launch of a new shared cinematic universe of Valiant Comics superheroes, "Bloodshot" was conceived to be followed by a sequel, two films based on the comic book series "Harbinger", and then a crossover film titled "Harbinger Wars". Though a "Harbinger" movie was initially scheduled to be the first installment in the franchise, development was delayed in favor of "Bloodshot".
The future of the franchise was questioned by various outlets, due to the moderate box office and critical reception.
In September 2019, it was announced that "Harbinger" would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. In March 2020, director David S. F. Wilson stated that even though different film studios have distribution rights, Valiant still plans to build a franchise from "Bloodshot", acknowledging that Diesel will play a large role in the future of the planned film series. In November 2020, a "Bloodshot" sequel was officially announced as being in development, with Diesel intended to reprise his role. By December of the same year, Diesel confirmed his involvement with the project.

He is also the only North Carolina high school player to record a quadruple-double. Clark was ranked as the No. 100 overall prospect by ESPN, No. 87 by Rivals and No. 90 by 247sports. He committed to Cincinnati on September 18, 2013 after receiving a scholarship offer from NC State.
College career.

Sukhvinder Amrit

Sukhvinder Amrit (born 1963) is a Punjabi poet and Ghazal singer. In November 2017 she was among nine female poets who received a Sulabh Sahitya Akademi Award at the All-India Poetess Conference.
Life.
Sukhwinder was in Sadarpura, in Jagraon tehsil, Punjab. She had one brother and was the eldest among her four sisters. She started writing poetry in her childhood though she had a terrible childhood. One day, her mother came across her notebook where she used to write poems. The end result was her notebook was burnt and she was beaten badly. She got married at an early age of seventeen when she was only in class nine. Life did not change much after her marriage, but due to her strong conviction and determination to learn and continue writing poems, she won the heart of her husband, Amarjit, and started her education. Surprisingly, she started her schooling from 10th class when her kids were also studying in the same school. She subsequently completed a M.A. degree in Punjabi literature. She served as a lecturer at Govt college, Ludhiana for one year.
She is at her artistic best in her short poems. In these the poetess recedes into the Ivory tower of her desires. She tries to fathom the depth of her feelings for the object of desire .&lt; Niranjan Singh Tasneem &gt; https://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010504/ldh.htm ,

His Dark Materials (TV series)

His Dark Materials is a fantasy drama television series based on the novel series of the same name by Philip Pullman. It is produced by Bad Wolf and New Line Productions, for BBC One and HBO, with the latter handling international distribution.
The eight-episode first series premiered on 3 November 2019 on BBC One in the United Kingdom, and on 4 November on HBO in the United States and other markets. The seven-episode second series premiered on 8 November 2020 in the United Kingdom, and on 16 November 2020 in the United States. In December 2020, "His Dark Materials" was renewed for a third and final series of eight episodes based on "The Amber Spyglass".
Premise.
"His Dark Materials" is set in a multi-world reality, with the action moving from one world to another. The series is based on Philip Pullman's trilogy of the same name. It begins in an alternative world where all humans' souls manifest as animal companions called daemons. The series follows the life of a young girl named Lyra who is an orphan living with the scholars at Jordan College, Oxford, in a world governed by the Magisterium, a religious and political body. Lyra discovers a dangerous secret that involves Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter, and is the subject of a witches prophecy that she will change the world. In her search for a missing friend, Lyra also uncovers a series of kidnappings and its link to a mysterious substance called Dust, which leads her on a journey of epic proportions and ultimately to other worlds. The witches' prophecy also links Lyra's destiny to Will, a teenager from our world, who is himself being pursued by mysterious figures connected to his vanished father.

Production.
Development.
The three "His Dark Materials" novels, written by Philip Pullman from 1995 to 2000, achieved critical and commercial success and were adapted into a 2007 feature film, "The Golden Compass". The film was criticised by fans of the trilogy for the dilution of elements of the story that were critical of religion, as well as from some religious organisations for the source material's perceived anti-religious themes. Despite earning $372 million worldwide, the film underperformed at the box office, making any sequels unlikely.
After several years, the rights reverted to Pullman. In November 2015, BBC One announced that it had commissioned a television adaptation of the trilogy, to be produced by Bad Wolf and New Line Cinema. The eight-part adaptation had a planned premiere date in 2017. In April 2017 writer Jack Thorne told "Radio Times" that the series was still in pre-production. He said, "It's at an exciting point where we're just throwing things at the page and trying to work out what works and what doesn't", and that he wanted to ensure that they were being loyal to the books. Director Otto Bathurst explained that some elements of the book and film had been changed to give the series a more modern feel, compared to the original's Victoriana fantasy.
On 12 September 2018, HBO was announced as the co-producer and international distributor of the series. On 10 October 2018, Miranda reported that he had wrapped up filming for his role. On 14 December 2018, it was announced that filming for the first series was complete.
Before the series premiered, it was renewed for a second series of eight episodes, which is primarily adapting the second book in the trilogy, "The Subtle Knife". Filming of the second series began before the premiere of the first, which was considered "a necessary move considering the age of the show's young star". While filming for series 2 was mostly completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, a standalone episode focusing on Lord Asriel was left unfinished. As a consequence the series ultimately only consisted of seven episodes. Although McAvoy completed a small amount of filming before production was shut down, his appearance in the series' final episode was filmed during the pandemic, repurposed from material written for the abandoned episode.
By November 2020, although a recommission had not yet been confirmed, work had begun on six of eight scripts for a third series adapting "The Amber Spyglass". With production set to begin in early 2021, the adaptation was renewed in December 2020 for a final series of eight episodes. Filming for the third series began on 24 May 2021.
Casting.
On 8 March 2018, it was announced that Dafne Keen had signed on to star in the series to play Lyra with director Tom Hooper signed on to direct. Lin-Manuel Miranda would star as Lee Scoresby. On 8 June 2018, it was reported that James McAvoy, Clarke Peters, and Ruth Wilson had joined the cast.
On 27 July 2018, the BBC and Bad Wolf revealed the cast and crew for the series.
On 1 July 2020, it was revealed that Bella Ramsey had been cast in the role of Angelica in series 2.
Additional casting for the third series was announced on 22 June 2021, including Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Commander Ogunwe, Jamie Ward as Father Gomez, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Balthamos, Simon Harrison as Baruch, and Amber Fitzgerald-Woolfe as Ama. Chipo Chung was also reported as playing the angel Xaphania, who was voiced by Sophie Okonedo in series 2.
On 20 September 2021, it was announced that Sian Clifford and Jonathan Aris had been cast in the series 3.
Music.
On 14 August 2019, it was announced that Lorne Balfe was hired to score the series. Speaking about the job, Balfe stated that he "wanted to write a musical letter to the creators of the show," also mentioning that the series was a "mammoth task" and one of his biggest projects yet. Scoring primarily took place in St David's Hall in Cardiff, Wales with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. While the ethnic Bulgarian choir was recorded in Bulgaria with additional remote sessions taking place at the Synchron Scoring Stage in Vienna, Austria with the Synchron Stage Orchestra. Also featured on the score are cellist Tina Guo, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, classical French horn player Sarah Willis, violinist Lindsey Stirling and recordist Richard Harvey. Two soundtrack albums were released; a musical anthology with thematic pieces and an album containing all the cues used in the series. Silva Screen Records released the albums digitally on 3 November 2019 and 20 December 2019 respectively.
Lorne Balfe's "His Dark Materials" score was nominated for two awards: for Best Original Score for a Television Series at the 2020 International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) awards and for Music - Original Title at the 2020 Royal Television Society, UK awards.
Release.
On 24 July 2019, it was announced that the series would premiere in the fourth quarter of 2019 in the United Kingdom and the United States. On 12 September 2019, sources revealed that the series was set to premiere on 3 November 2019 on BBC One and the following night on HBO.
In New Zealand, the series is broadcast by Sky TV and is available on streaming service Neon. The series began on 5 November 2019. In Australia, the series is distributed by the cable and satellite television company Foxtel through their HBO output deal.
The second series premiered on 8 November 2020 in the United Kingdom, and on 16 November 2020 in the United States.
Reception.
Critical response.
Series 1.
Series one received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the first series has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 96 critics, with an average rating of 6.99/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "The daemon is in the details and while "His Dark Materials" visual splendor and exceptional performances deftly capture the essence of Philip Pullman's seminal novels, it could use a little more magic." On Metacritic, the series has a score of 69 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Dan Fienberg of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that "...this effort nails much of what makes the books pop, and both the special effects and a star-studded cast led by Dafne Keen and Ruth Wilson are in fine form." However he followed that by saying "What never fully worked for me in the four episodes [...] sent to critics is the necessary feeling of narrative and thematic momentum. It's vastly better than the movie, but neither fun nor smart enough to quite succeed." Caroline Framke of "Variety" wrote: "Despite the rich complexities of the novel's world of daemons, power-hungry players and warring faiths, HBO's "His Dark Materials" feels like it could have been plucked from most any other fantasy epic out there." Beth Elderkin of Gizmodo was critical of the show's inability to capture the connection between humans and daemons.
Ben Lawrence of "The Telegraph" gave the first episode 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "a fine piece of drama, capturing the strangeness and childlike wonder of the books, but also their rigour and bite. This is intelligent populism writ large." Huw Fullerton of the "Radio Times" gave the first episode a positive review: "While there is a slight element of table-setting in the series' first hour the appeal of the actors and setting are beguiling enough to pull you through all the exposition and explanation." Fullerton praised Wilson for her performance, saying she "nearly walks away with the whole series". David Levesley of British GQ wrote that "His Dark Materials" as a whole illustrates the fundamental problem with remaking adaptations, writing "the execution doesn't feel far enough removed from the previous version to actually make for a significantly better product."
Series 2.
Series two received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second series has an approval rating of 81% based on reviews from 26 critics, with an average rating of 6.87/10. The website's critical consensus reads: ""His Dark Materials" chilly emotional core and imposing complexity is unlikely to win over the unconverted, but its sophomore season rewards the faithful with impeccable production values and cerebral thrills." On Metacritic, series 2 has a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 4 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Stuart Jeffries of "The Guardian" praised the series and in particular the villainous Mrs Coulter, calling Pullman's creation a compelling monster that writer Jack Thorne clearly "revels in punching up Coulter as a combination of Iago and Lady Macbeth with a hint, at her most pantomimic, of Cruella de Vil" and "you never know what she might do next". Jeffries was critical of the musical score, comparing it to the "boy who cried wolf", leaving audiences in doubt if the next dramatic moment was quite as significant as the music was suggesting, and undermining the two good lead actors who convey the necessary dramatic tension in their performances. Ed Cumming of "The Independent" wrote: "His Dark Materials looks great, it's robustly made, and there are great actors everywhere, occupying well-built universes. But it doesn't inspire as much wonder as it ought to."
Ed Power of "The Irish Times" was critical of the series. Despite the strong cast, he called it "slow-moving and inhospitable towards newcomers" and plodding in its execution. Power blames Pullman's source material: "frankly the whole thing is a bit of a drag. It's never fun being preached to, not even by an atheist." He concludes ""His Dark Materials" has a lot going for it. But it desperately lacks a sense of fun and, crucial for fantasy, the promise of escapism."

Ticsani

Ticsani is a volcano in Peru northwest of Moquegua. It consists of two volcanoes that form a complex: "old Ticsani", which is a compound volcano that underwent a large collapse in the past and shed of mass down the Rio Tambo valley. Today an arcuate ridge remains of this edifice; the other is a complex of three lava domes which were emplaced during the Holocene. Two sub-Plinian eruptions took place during the Holocene, producing the so-called "Grey Ticsani" and "Brown Ticsani" deposits; the last eruption occurred after the 1600 eruption of neighbouring Huaynaputina. The volcano is seismically active and features active hot springs and fumaroles; since 2015 the volcano is monitored by the Peruvian government.
Geography and geomorphology.
Ticsani is in the Ichuna District of Peru, northwest of Moquegua. The Putina River passes northwest and the Carumas River southwest of the volcano. The area is remote, which has hampered exploration efforts. There are paved roads in the area, which can be accessed mainly through the Ilo-Desaguadero highway that passes within from the Ticsani domes.
Volcanism in South America occurs along its western coast and in several volcanic belts, including the Central Volcanic Zone that Ticsani is part of. In southern Peru the Central Volcanic Zone includes the volcanoes Solimana, Coropuna, Ampato, Sabancaya, Chachani, El Misti, Ubinas, Huaynaputina, Ticsani, Tutupaca, Calientes, Yucamane, Purupuruni and Casiri. The volcanoes of Peru were active in the Plio-Quaternary and produced mainly calc-alkaline magmas such as andesite although more silicic rocks also occur.
Ticsani features three lava domes, which were generated by latest Pleistocene and Holocene activity; two of which are located within or at the margins of craters. The southeasternmost dome is wide and high, the middle dome with a width of and a height of no less than is the largest of Ticsani. The northwestern dome has dimensions of . Pyroclastic flow deposits, generated during the collapse and growth of the lava domes, fill shallow valleys on the eastern flank. An earlier compound volcano is today preserved as a long arcuate ridge, which is northeast of the northernmost dome and opens to the west. This earlier volcano ("old Ticsani") crops out over an area of and consists of ignimbrites, lava flows, volcaniclastic deposits and debris from a large sector collapse; a cryptodome is exposed within the arcuate ridge. The complex reaches an elevation of . The position of the lava domes and the structure of the compound volcano were influenced by local fault systems.
Geology.
Off the southwestern coast of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench, at a rate of . This subduction process is responsible for the growth of the Andes and for volcanism in the region; the oblique character of subduction has further led to the onset of strike-slip faulting.
Ticsani is grouped together with the neighbouring volcanoes Huaynaputina and Ubinas, given their tectonic context, which is unusual for Peruvian volcanoes and shared geochemical traits. Huaynaputina had a large eruption in 1600 and Ubinas is presently the most active volcano in southern Peru. These volcanoes appear to share a magma chamber at a depth of .
The basement on which these volcanoes rose includes a Paleoproterozoic pluton. It is covered by the Mesozoic Yura Group and Matalaque Formation (sedimentary and volcanic rocks, respectively) which are exposed at the Rio Tambo. Volcanic activity continued during the Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene, forming ignimbrites and the Barroso Group.
Composition.
The complex has erupted andesite during the compound volcano stage and dacite during the lava dome stage; both define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Phenocrysts found in the later eruption products include amphibole, biotite, feldspar, plagioclase, pyroxene and quartz.
Eruption history.
Ticsani was active during the Pleistocene and Holocene. At first, a compound volcano developed at Ticsani. This volcano collapsed and formed a landslide deposit in the Rio Tambo valley which originally had a volume of about , and is thus the largest such collapse in southern Peru during the Pleistocene. This volcano stage constitutes the "old Ticsani". The later "new Ticsani" produced lava flows and later the lava domes; the lava flows may have issued from a now almost entirely buried crater.
Later the three lava domes were emplaced, with the southeastern dome being the oldest and the northwestern the youngest. Two or three explosive eruptions took place, accompanied by the emission of volcanic ash, blocks, lava bombs and pumice. The first eruption with a tephra volume of about - happened at 10,600 ± 80 years before present, and is known as the "Grey Ticsani" eruption. It is the most important explosive eruption at Ticsani and its deposits form large desertic landscapes east of the volcano. A second eruption may have occurred in the middle Holocene. The last sub-Plinian to phreatomagmatic eruption ("Brown Ticsani") took place shortly before the Huaynaputina eruption of 1600, generating about of tephra and occurred before the formation of the youngest lava dome. This volcano stage also produced lava flows which filled valleys, formed a lava flow field northwest of the volcano and pyroclastic flows on the eastern side of the volcano. There are no historical eruptions at Ticsani.
Presently, hot springs are found in the valleys west of Ticsani, and two fumaroles have been observed at its summit. Known springs occur at Chuchumbaya, Putina Arriba and Secolaque; the Putina River hot springs are among the most important in Peru. In 2005, earthquake activity was noted beneath Ticsani, possibly related to a hydrothermal system, which raised alarm and concern among the local population. A seismic swarm took place between 2014-2017. A characteristic trait of Ticsani are so-called "hybrid" earthquakes which are noticed at seismic stations of other volcanoes. A temporary seismic station installed 2015 at Ticsani recorded volcano-tectonic earthquakes, and other changes in its behaviour have been observed as well.
Hazards.
About 5,000 people live within to Ticsani and would be threatened in the case of a future eruption, with particular hazards including ash fall, lahars, pyroclastic flows and the collapse of lava domes. Large explosive events like the "Grey Ticsani" and "Brown Ticsani" eruptions ejected material mainly in north-northeastern and southeastern direction; in case of a repeat eruption the towns Calacoa, Cuchumbaya, Quebaya, San Cristóbal and Soquezane would be impacted by tephra fallout. In addition to the local population, ashfall would hit major regional roads, reservoirs, mines and airports. Additional towns in the area include Cambrune and Carumas. Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving flows of hot rock fragments and gases; at Ticsani they have reached distances of at least from the volcano. A repeat of the sector collapse of the "old Ticsani" is improbable as the "new Ticsani" is considered to be stable, but parts of the old volcano could still fail and generate lahars in the river valleys. Volcanic gases may accumulate in valleys and depressions, while lava flows are unlikely to reach large distances and are thus minor threats.
The volcano is classified as being a "High Risk Volcano". In 2015, facilities to monitor the chemical composition of hot springs around the volcano were installed, and devices to recognize deformations of the volcanic edifices are installed. The Peruvian Southern Volcanological Observatory (Observatorio Vulcanológico del Sur) publishes monthly reports on Ticsani since 2014, which include reports on seismic activity and on sulfur dioxide emissions.

Robin DR500

The Robin DR500 Président is a wooden low wing monoplane, manufactured by Robin Aircraft and marketed as a top-of-the-range DR400. It has a tricycle undercarriage, 4+1 seating configuration, is powered by a more powerful 200CV fuel-injected Lycoming engine and is larger and better-equipped than the standard DR.400.
Development.
The Robin DR500 concept first originated in the 1980s as the DR.400 NGL or "Nouvelle Génération Large", but the idea was not resurrected until the late 1990s by the new owners of Robin Aircraft. It took its name from the HR.100/250TR Président of 1974. Known and marketed as the DR.500, it is actually an extension of the DR.400's type certificate, so is sometimes referenced in official documents as the DR400/500. It was intended to fill the niche between 180 hp fixed undercarriage and 250 hp retractable undercarriage aircraft, with 1500 km range at cruise speeds of 260 km/h (143kt). The maiden flight of prototype F-WZZY was on 29 May 1997 with Daniel Müller as test pilot. 18 were produced in 1999 and 9 in 2000.
Design.
Compared to the original DR.400, the DR.500 has a larger engine cowling and a larger bubble-like canopy like that on the R3000 or X4, making the cabin 40 cm longer, 10 cm wider at the shoulders and providing 5 cm more headroom. Like the Jodel D140, it has five seatbelts. The DR.500 has a new instrument panel, finished in grey and beige, and leather seats as standard; electric trim and electrically-operated flaps are also standard. The wing is slightly thicker than that on the DR.400, and it benefits from new, more streamlined wheel fairings. The DR.500 is powered by a fuel-injected 200 hp Lycoming driving a two-blade Hartzell variable-pitch propeller. There is a gas strut to keep the externally-accessible luggage compartment door open. Total fuel capacity is 275 litres: two 40l wing tanks, 105l under the floor, and an optional 90l tank under the baggage compartment.

Teresa Martínez de Varela

Teresa Martínez de Varela (also known under the pseudonym, Lisa de Andráfueda, 1 July 1913–16 June 1998) was an Afro-Colombian teacher and writer. She was one of the first black women in Colombia to publish. Misunderstood, and often denied the ability to publish her works, the intellectual left many unpublished manuscripts at her death. For many years, she was known only as the mother of , founder of Grupo Niche. Rediscovered in 2009, when Úrsula Mena de Lozano published her biography, some of her works were then collected in an anthology published by the Ministry of Culture in 2010. She is now regarded as one of the pioneering voices to bring African identity in Colombia into the literary landscape of the country and one of the primary intellectuals of her era.
Early life.
Teresa de Jesús Martínez Arce was born on 1 July 1913 in Quibdó, capital of the Chocó Department, in western Colombia to Ana Teresa Arce Campaña and Eladio Martínez Vélez. Her father was of Afro-Colombian heritage and worked as an engineer on boats along the Atrato River, operated a sawmill and was a musician. Her mother was of Spanish descent and encouraged Marínez to read from her father's large library from a young age. Not allowed to play with the black children in her neighborhood, she was aware of her differences, as she stood out from her schoolmates because she was mulatto. She was a voracious reader, consuming magazines and newspapers from the capital, as well as works by Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Simone de Beauvoir, Victor Hugo, Jean-Paul Sartre and Harriet Beecher Stowe. 
Martínez attended the Presentation School in Quibdó, but was not allowed to continue her education there due to her mixed race. She moved to Cartagena to complete her secondary studies at Pius X College (), gaining a mastery in both English and French. She then attended normal school in Cartagena, before returning to Quibdó to begin researching the differences in slavery on Colombia's Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. Martínez married the merchant Pedro Varela Restrepo and the couple would have six children: Eladio Enrique, Pedro Francisco, , Martha, Norma Gloria and Martha Lucía. 
Career.
Martínez began her career as a teacher in 1932, at the "Escuela Urbana" (Urban School) in Bagadó. Discontent to be a housewife and cook, when she and her husband separated, shortly after her youngest child, Martha Lucía was born, she taught Spanish, painting and weaving at the "Escuela de Artes y Oficios" (School of Arts and Crafts) in Quibdó. Publishing her first novel, "Guerra y amor" (War and Love) in 1947, she wrote about the ravages of World War II in Europe. In 1962, Martínez took the children and moved to Bogotá, where she taught at the Colegio Femenino de Bachillerato y Comercio. After several years there, they returned to the Chocó Department where she became the director of the "Normal de Istmina" (Normal School of Istmina) and later served as head of the "Normal de Señoritas" (Women's Normal School), in Quibdó and as the Secretary of Education for the Chocó Department. 
Martínez's literary output, though she had difficulty in finding publishers, was prolific. She published poems and essays assessing the cultural, historical and political issues facing Colombia, incorporated religious and romantic themes, as well as humor. Her work showed a deep understanding of the history of the country, as well as its literary and musical traditions. She published dramatic works including "El nueve de Abril" (April 9th), a protest of the assassination in 1948 of presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán; "Las fuerzas armadas" (The Armed Forces); "La madre fósil" (The Mother Fossil), as well as an opera, "La virgen loca" (The Crazy Madonna). Among her poetic works are "Alucinaciones o dimensión desconocida" (Hallucinations or Unknown Dimension), "Ciudades de Colombia" (Cities of Colombia), "Fragua de Marte" (Forge of Mars), "Pirotecnia de la fe" (Pyrotechnics of Faith), and "Vivencias de una tormenta de amor" (Experiences from a Storm of Love), which combine Latin American modernism with traditional African rhythms. In 1983, she published "Mi Cristo negro" (My Black Christ), as a commentary on the execution of Manuel Saturio Valencia. Valencia, an Afro-Colombian lawyer, "was the last person executed under the death penalty in Colombia". The book became well known to black Colombians, contributing to awareness of racism and served a catalyst for black pride to reemerge in the region.
Though Martínez believed she was misunderstood and had been largely overlooked by literary critics and editors because of her gender and race, she hoped that her work would eventually be recognized. She did receive some recognition during her lifetime, as she was included in a book "Mujeres Intelectuales de América" (Woman Intellecutals of America) by the Central Information Bureau of Caracas, Venezuela. She was invited by the poet , who at the time was serving as the first director of the Colombian Institute of Culture to tour the country and give recitations of her poetry. In 1993, she came to the attention of writer Úrsula Mena, who read some of Martínez's poetry, while preparing a presentation on Afro-Colombian writers. The two women struck up an acquaintance and Mena became determined to write a biography to preserve Martínez's legacy. Before she could write the book, she and Martínez's daughters, sorted and cataloged the unpublished works. They released "Cantos de amor y soledad" (Songs of Love and Loneliness), the most complete collection of her works, before Mena returned to writing the biography.
Death and legacy.
Martínez died on 16 June 1998 in Quibdó. Largely forgotten except as the mother of Jairo Varela, in 2009, Úrsula Mena de Lozano published a biography of Martínez, "En honor a la verdad" (In Honor of the Truth), reviving interest and evaluation of the author. The following year, the Ministry of Culture included a biography of Martínez and some of her works in an anthology of Afro-Colombian poets. She is now recognized as one of the pioneer voices of Afro-Colombian writers and as one of the most important intellectuals of her era.

Tonnage Tour

The Tonnage Tour was a worldwide concert tour by American rock band ZZ Top in support of their 2016 live album "Live! Greatest Hits from Around the World". The tour consisted of six legs that alternated between indoor and outdoor shows in the US, along with arenas and festivals in Europe. Much like their recent tours, the Tonnage Tour featured a stripped-down, intimate stage design. The band played a mixture of older and newer material during their set, which included songs from their latest studio album "La Futura" (2012).
Kevin Kinder from the "Fayetteville Flyer" thought the concert was "a highly choreographed concert, both subtly in the way Gibbons and bassist Dusty Hill swayed in unison during several moments, and more overtly in the way the show was paced." The last eighteen dates in 2017 were cancelled to due Dusty Hill having an ailment.
After 90 concerts in 2017, the Tonnage Tour grossed US$11.2 million, making it one of the top 200 grossing tours of the year. For the first two legs alone, the tour grossed $6.3 million with 166,943 tickets sold. After the fourth leg in the US, the tour's schedule was expanded to feature a co-headlining leg with John Fogerty, which was branded as "Blues &amp; Bayous", and grossed $9 million with 359,553 tickets sold. At its conclusion, the Tonnage Tour had sold 1,083,675 tickets – with 154 shows – for a total gross of $26.2 million.

Rotunda Zamość

The Rotunda Zamość or the Museum of Martyrdom of the Zamość region - Rotunda (), is a Polish museum devoted to remembering the atrocities committed at the former Rotunda Zamość Nazi German camp located in Zamość near Lublin. The Nazi German Gestapo camp was set up in occupied Poland during World War II, as part of the Polish extermination program known as the German AB-Aktion in Poland, Ethnic cleansing of Zamojszczyzna by Nazi Germany...
History.
Rotunda was built between 1825 and 1831 in accordance with the design of General Jean-Baptiste Mallet de Grandville. Was part of the fortifications of the Zamość Fortress. During World War II and German AB-Aktion in Poland in 1940 was taken over by the German Gestapo precinct. It served as a prison, holding camp and a place off mass execution of Polish people.
8000 people died in the Gestapo Rotunda camp in Zamość. Nobody was judged for those crimes. During Generalplan Ost and Ethnic cleansing of Zamojszczyzna by Nazi Germany from Zamość Region Germans resettled 297 villages, about 110,000 Polish people, including 16,000 to Majdanek concentration camp, 2,000 to KL Auschwitz-Birkenau. 30,000 children were resettled. 4,500 Polish children from Zamosc Region deported to Germany in order to be Germanized

Leone Buyse

Leone Buyse (born 1947) is the Joseph and Ida K. Mullen Professor of Flute and Chair of Woodwinds at Rice University's Shepherd School of Music. Prior to a full-time career teaching, Buyse spent over 22 years as an orchestral flutist, including a decade from 1983-1993 as Principal Flute of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops Orchestra. Other orchestral positions include Rochester Philharmonic as solo piccolo and second flute, and assistant principal of San Francisco Symphony. In addition to the Shepherd School, she has held faculty positions at the New England Conservatory, Boston University, University of Michigan, as visiting professor at the Eastman School of Music and numerous summer festivals including the Tanglewood Institute. Her primary teachers include Marcel Moyse, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Michel Debost and Joseph Mariano.
Biography.
Leone Karena Buyse was born in 1947 into a musical family and grew up in Ithaca, New York. Her mother received two degrees from the Eastman School of Music, which Buyse later attended. Ithaca is home to Cornell University, where she along with her family often attended concerts and heard many of the important musicians of the time, including flutists Julius Baker and Albert Tipton, and composer Nadia Boulanger. This musical upbringing and exposure to world class musicians from an early age contributed greatly to her musical development. Buyse first began playing the violin and piano, then switched to the flute at age nine. When she was 12, she began studying with David Berman of Ithaca College before attending the Eastman School of Music to study with Joseph Mariano in 1965. In 1968 during her time at Eastman, she received a Fulbright Scholarship to study in France with Jean-Pierre Rampal, Marcel Moyse and Michel Debost, three internationally distinguished flutists and pedagogues. Buyse graduated with Distinction and a Performer's Certificate from Eastman in 1968. In 1969, she was selected as the only American finalist in that year's Geneva International Flute Competition.
Subsequently, she received a Master of Music Degree in Flute Performance from Emporia State University (then Kansas State Teacher's College), while teaching undergraduate flute students and studying flute repertoire with the woodwind faculty. Her Master's Thesis titled "The French Rococo Style Exemplified in Selected Chamber Works of Joseph Bodin Boismortier (1689-1755)", was published in "The Emporia State Research Studies" in 1979. Her first professional orchestral position was with the Rochester Philharmonic as solo piccolo and second flute. She credits this position as giving her confidence to grow as an orchestral player and preparing her for positions in the San Francisco Symphony and later, the Boston Symphony. Buyse was invited by Seiji Ozawa to join the Boston Symphony as assistant principal of the Symphony and principal of the Boston Pops in 1983.
During her career as a part of the Boston Symphony, she appeared as a soloist numerous times with the orchestra and with the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. She also appeared with the l'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, San Francisco Symphony, Utah Symphony and the New Hampshire Music Festival, where she acted as principal flute for over a decade. During her time in Boston, she collaborated and recorded with many artists, including her colleague and Eastman classmate Fenwick Smith. She has appeared in recital with international soloists Jessye Norman and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, in addition to chamber ensembles from the Juilliard School of Music and Muir String Quartets, the Boston Musica Viva, and Da Camera of Houston. In 1992, she received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Emporia State University.
In 1993, she decided to pursue a more active career as a teacher. Since that time, she has held faculty positions at the New England Conservatory, Boston University, University of Michigan, and numerous summer festivals including the Tanglewood Institute. She was awarded the National Flute Association's Lifetime Achievement Award for significant and outstanding contributions to the global flute community in 2010. Buyse is recognized as one of the foremost flute pedagogues in America, and the international community. Her students hold positions in major US and North American orchestras, as well as teaching positions at universities such as the University of Texas at Austin, University of Colorado at Boulder, and St. Olaf College, in addition to many others. Buyse is also an accomplished pianist and served as Rampal's collaborative pianist for two of his famous summer schools in Nice, France.
She currently holds positions at Rice's Shepherd School of Music and the Youth Orchestra of the Americas. She travels throughout the US and internationally for recitals and masterclasses, including Mexico, Brazil, Panama, Chile, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
Personal life.
Buyse married clarinetist and conductor Michael Webster in 1988. He holds the position of Professor of Music at the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University and Artistic Director of the Houston Youth Philharmonic Orchestra. Buyse, Webster and pianist Robert Moeling form the Webster Trio, an internationally recognized chamber ensemble. The duo aims to increase the repertoire which exists for this instrumentation of flute, clarinet and piano.

PRhyme 2

PRhyme 2 is the second studio album by American hip hop duo PRhyme, consisting of Royce da 5'9" and DJ Premier. Produced entirely by DJ Premier, the album features samples composed by producer AntMan Wonder. It was released on March 16, 2018 via their own record label PRhyme Records and INgrooves Music Group, and is a sequel to the eponymous album "PRhyme". The album features guest appearances from rappers 2 Chainz, Big K.R.I.T., Dave East, Rapsody, Roc Marciano, Yelawolf, Chavis Chandler, bassist Brady Watt and singers Novel (as a part of duo Summer of '96 with Wonder), CeeLo Green and Denaun Porter.
Background.
As early as September 2015, Royce mentioned rappers Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and The Game on Twitter as possible featured artists on "PRhyme 2". On February 18, 2016 in an interview with "Vibe", Royce stated that in April of the same year that him and DJ Premier were going to begin recording songs for the album: "I can tell you that me and Preem are going in April to do "PRhyme 2"." A year later on March 16, 2017 in an interview with "Billboard", Premier stated that "PRhyme 2" was nearing completion but still needed to have features and mixing on the songs: "PRhyme 2 is almost done. I’m one song away from finishing but we still have to mix and we have features. We still got to get all the features locked down." Two months later on May 18, it was revealed that Royce and Premier were in the studio working on the album. Six months later on November 3, both Royce and Premier officially announced that "PRhyme 2" was completed and that they were planning a release date. On February 25, 2018, the tracklist and cover art were released.
Critical reception.
"PRhyme 2" received mostly favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 6 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews." Neil Z. Young at AllMusic commented that "combined with hard-hitting beats, old-school scratching, and a dizzying maze of dense rhymes, "PRhyme 2" satisfies more than its predecessor and should please fans of Smoke DZA and Pete Rock's collaborative "Don't Smoke Rock", Run the Jewels' more laid-back material, and the Dilated Peoples catalog." Scott Glaysher of "XXL" compared it to their previous album and noted the varying content that Royce frequently switched from: "Despite "PRhyme 2" being twice as long as its nine-track predecessor, Premier never defaults to redundant sounds. “1 of the Hardest” loops a head-banging guitar riff, “Era” uses twinkly synths that rapidly alternate between left and right speaker channels, “Flirt” sports a classic New York bassline and chorus that nods to Camp Lo's "Luchini"—and that’s just to name a few of the album's different flavors. Musically and lyrically, "PRhyme 2" holds its own next to its precursor."
Kyle Mullin of "Exclaim!" praised "PRhyme 2" for DJ Premier's production and Royce's subject matter on the album but criticized it for not being as sufficient of an effort as there was on the previous effort, calling CeeLo Green's hook on the track "Gotta Love It" "cloying" and "Flirt" being "laughably clunky" and "brutally sexist". Karas Lamb at "Consequence of Sound" appreciated the "building bridges between hip-hop’s veterans and rising icons, who will predict the size and shape of the next wave", but felt that Royce's "appetite for glory also makes room for ego and showmanship to muddy the final mix". Lamb questioned the choice behind Premier's "decision to lean on other producers for the sound" for the previous album and "PRhyme 2", calling it "curious and unnecessary". Jonah Bromwich of "Pitchfork" was also interested in the choice, stating that it was an "unusual constraint" and said that "sometimes, the veteran Detroit rapper [Royce] transcends his natural Buddenism, avoiding corny punchlines, esoteric lyrical easter eggs, and bars that lead him nowhere. At other times, he doesn’t."

Pyecombe hook

A Pyecombe hook is a distinctive shepherd's crook crafted in the old forge at the village of Pyecombe in Sussex, England since the 19th century. The Pyecombe hook was perfectly balanced with a twist that allowed shepherds to easily catch the hind leg of a sheep without injuring the sheep. Its use is described by Charles Mitchell: “the curve is made so that the shepherd can hook it around the sheep’s leg, slide it up, give it a slight twist, and the sheep is caught fast without being in the least hurt.” It was often made out of old gun barrels.
Pyecombe village stands on an ancient drove road on the South Downs and has a long shepherding history. The Pyecombe hook was very popular amongst shepherds in Sussex for about 200 years. A surviving Pyecombe hook is integrated into the Tapsel gate at the entrance to the Churchyard of Pyecombe church. It is illustrated on the Pyecombe village sign. There is an example in the Sussex Archaeological Society's Museum at Lewes.
It was made in the first half of the 19th century by Mr Berry, the blacksmith, in the old forge, now a private house, just opposite the entrance to the church. It continued to be made there by his successor, Mr Charles Mitchell, who owned the forge from 1872 to 1946. The church has a ceremonial Pyecombe hook made in 1946 by Mr Sean Black, the last blacksmith at the forge.
The hook is celebrated in song:-

Violet Hill Whyte

Violet Hill Whyte (November 18, 1897 – 1980, born Violet Hill) was a teacher, the first black officer to be appointed to the Baltimore Police Department in Maryland, and a community activist. She was appointed in December 1937 by Commissioner William P. Lawson, and served for 30 years, reaching the rank of lieutenant. In addition, she participated on numerous community boards and commissions, working to improve the lives of women and children especially in Baltimore.
Biography.
Violet Hill was born in Washington D.C. on November 18, 1897. Her parents were Daniel G. Hill and Margaret Peck Hill, and she had nine younger siblings. Among her brothers was Daniel G. Hill II. His son Daniel G. Hill III became a prominent sociologist and activist in Ontario, Canada. Her father was university educated and an ordained minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent black denomination in the United States. Her brother Daniel also graduated from college and became an AME minister, serving in Missouri and the West. Violet Hill graduated from Douglass High School and Coppin State College.
She married George Sumner Whyte and they had four children together. She worked as a public school teacher for nearly two decades in Baltimore, Maryland, before becoming a police officer.
Whyte became interested in working as a police officer. She completed the training program and was appointed in 1937 as the first black officer in the Baltimore Police Department. (Atlanta, Georgia by contrast, did not appoint any black officers to its police department until 1948.) Whyte served for 30 years before retiring, reaching the rank of lieutenant. She died in 1980.
Career as police officer.
"I'm not afraid of hard work." - Violet Hill White
Whyte was appointed to the northwest district at Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin Street by Commissioner William Lawson. She was not given a gun. Her duties included patrolling the streets, homicide investigations, narcotics cases, assaults, cases of sexual abuse, and robberies. She was known to work undercover. Youth who lived in her district said later that she would often intervene when she saw students skipping school. Her efforts earned her the nickname "lady law." Juvenile Court Judge Charles E. Moylan Jr. described her as "a one-woman police force and a one-woman social worker combined". In 1955, she was promoted to sergeant and oversaw policewomen. She ended her career in the Western District. Before her retirement in 1967 after 30 years of service, she was promoted to lieutenant.
Over the course of her career, Whyte earned six commendations and numerous awards. She also served on the following Boards and Commissions: The Governor's Commission to Study Problems of Illegitimacy; cd Called to Testify on National Television on "Kefauver Congressional Committee on U. S. Narcotic Violations"; Secretary to the Board of Directors of Provident Hospital; Secretary to the Board of Managers of Boys' Village of Maryland; Member of the Speakers Bureau of the National Women's Christian Temperance Union; Governor's Commission - A Study "Juvenile Delinquency and Adult Penal Conditions"; Board Member - Maryland Safety Council; and Organizer and Chairperson - Holiday Institutional Committee.
Community work.
In addition to her police work, Whyte was an active volunteer: She collected clothing for prison inmates and made holiday baskets for the needy. One year she planned a Christmas party for 4,000 children at the Royal Theatre. She also lectured in the community about child abuse. Her lecture included a six-point child's bill of rights.
After retiring, she continued to volunteer, working with Planned Parenthood as a field supervisor. She also worked with the Neighborhood Family Planning Center.

Margrete Drejer

Margrete Tora Drejer (1889–1975) was a Danish painter and textile artist who is remembered for the important part she played in teaching the art and history of sewing and textile decoration to women of all ages. Her own creations include textiles for churches as well as flags and banners.
Biography.
Born on 13 October 1889 in Copenhagen, Margrete Tora Drejer was the daughter of the timber merchant Jens Nielsen Drejer (1845–1914) and Marie Hansen (1859–1943). She was brought up in a home on Amager, where both her mother and her grandmother were skilled embroiderers. Her elder sister, Valborg, was trained by Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesbøll. In 1921, she moved with her mother and sister to Brønshøj where she lived for the rest of her life.
From 1904, Drejer spent four years at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Women's School for Drawing and Craftmanship) where she learned both painting and embroidery, including goldwork, hedebo and fiber work. After matriculating from highschool, she was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1910 where she studied painting and decorative art under Joakim Skovgaard, graduating in 1914. She then taught embroidery in Clara Wæver's studio, also undertaking embroidery work on commission, especially flags and banners. From 1921 she taught both embroidery and painting at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder. Together with the architect Gunnar Biilmann Petersen (1897–1968), she headed the school from 1924 to 1929.
Drejer was a major contributor to the three-volume needlework lexicon "Berlingske Haandarbejds-Bog" in which she naturally covered goldwork and hedebo but also, rather surprisingly, crochet. Together with Johanne Arnbech-Jensen, she also published "Sting og Mønstre for Skole og Hjem" (Stitches and Patterns for School and Home).
Margrete Drejer died in Frederiksberg on 15 May 1975 and is buried in Sundby Cemetery.

Racism in United States college fraternities and sororities

Racism in United States college fraternities and sororities ("Greek life") has been linked to the experience of microaggressions, fewer opportunities to use the networking system built into Greek life, and harmful stereotypes. This fuels the experiences of people of color throughout their lives in various academic, work, and personal spaces, including Greek Life Organizations (GLOs). Many have argued that through the creation of these organizations, there has been a legacy of racism, which has fueled the elitist structure that has negatively impacted people of color the most[citation needed].
History.
Greek life has a long history of policies that have contributed to racism and lack of diversity in many Greek organizations. In resistance to racism in GLOs, as far back as 1906, Black GLOs were founded. Members of other racial groups began to form their own fraternities and sororities. In 1912, the first Latino fraternity, Sigma Iota, was founded at Louisiana State University; in 1931, it merged to form Phi Iota Alpha, the oldest Latino fraternity. In 1948, the first MGLO fraternity was founded at the University of Toledo and the first Latina sorority were founded in 1975. In 1981, the first MGLO sorority was founded at Rutgers University. More MGLOs were founded “nationally and locally” the following years to continue as a “foundation transcending racial, national, and religious differences”. Soon after, Multicultural Greek Councils were formed to govern affiliated MGLOs, both national or local fraternities and sororities.
By the end of the 1960s, White Greek Life Organizations (WGLOs) eliminated official policies that prohibited race-based membership. However abolishing these clauses did not prevent GLOs from using other means of maintaining racist and exclusive practices. Following the elimination of explicitly racist policies, Greek organizations sustained their racist practices through more informal means of discrimination. This is often seen through forms of de facto segregation, white supremacist overtones at Greek parties and events, mock “slave auctions”, and accounts of white fraternity members dressing in “blackface”. For instance, several white fraternities have been found building homecoming floats with racist themes, staging racist skits, and holding parties with racist themes. Furthermore, in terms of de facto segregation, despite eliminating racially exclusionary policies, many white Greek life organizations failed to actively pursue and promote new members of color. Therefore, lack of diversity within Greek Life organizations remains relatively unchanged.
People of color continue to feel marginalized within these organizations. Because the foundations of Greek life were built on biased practices, WGLOs continue to provide a structure that enforces euro-centrism and conformity among its members. Although Greek systems today are not divided into separate racial categories, GLOs are still viewed as the desirable option when it comes to seeking membership, because they historically have had more access to resources and networking opportunities that people in non-white GLOs do not. At the present moment, WGLOs are pressured to integrate people of color, but they do so under conditions that they set themselves. This puts those people of color wanting to join in positions where they both have to “perform” and embrace their ethnic differences, while trying to assimilate to traditional practices that encourage homogeneity.
Contemporary incidents.
People of color face wide-ranging forms of discrimination in Greek life. Members of color see white peers use blackface as a form of humor and they are more harshly judged when they do not participate in events that are incongruent with their personal beliefs. The use of blackface as a form of humor or entertainment has a lasting legacy in all aspects of American society, including Greek Life. This legacy stretches from Mark Twain’s fondness for shows with performers in blackface to current Halloween costumes. Another example of the racialized experiences that members of color face are when Latinx members of WGLOs feel as though they are being labeled as lazy if they chose not to participate in networking opportunities. Labels like these are products of racial stereotypes about Latinx people.
GLOs for decades have formed multicultural and ethnically specific councils and organizations, in an attempt to control their own organizations. The purpose of Multicultural Greek Life Organizations (MGLOs) is to promote cultural group identity and to create spaces that are more conducive to the advancement of cultural interest groups, including Asian Americans and Latin Americans. For example, in 1930, the National Pan-Hellenic Council was formed to further the interest of black fraternities and sororities during an era when the white fraternities and sororities practiced racial and religious segregation.
In 2020, college students and alumni across the nation started "Abolish Greek Life" Instagram accounts discussing how the Greek system at their respective colleges promote racism, anti-semitism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, classism, elitism, exploitation, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and rape culture. People following and promoting these accounts want to abolish Greek life because they feel every attempt to reform it has failed.

Open access in Denmark

Open access to scholarly communication in Denmark has grown rapidly since the 1990s. As in other countries in general, open access publishing is less expensive than traditional, paper-based, pre-Internet publishing.
Repositories and platforms.
There are a number of collections of scholarship in Denmark housed in digital open access repositories. They contain journal articles, book chapters, data, and other research outputs that are free to read. The consortial Scandinavian hprints repository began operating in 2008, specializing in arts, humanities, and social sciences content. In 2017, Aarhus University launched an open science platform, SPOMAN.
Policy.
Leaders of the Copenhagen Business School voted in June 2009 to adopt an open access mandate, the first of its kind in Denmark.
In 2012 Denmark's main public funders of research began requiring that grantees deposit articles into open access digital repositories. In 2014, the Danish Ministry of Research created a national policy requiring open access for all publicly funded research published after 2020.

Ralph Miller (alpine skier)

Ralph English Miller, Jr. (born September 23, 1933) is an American alpine ski racer. At age 22, he competed in three events at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, when he was one of the top downhill racers in the world. During those Olympics, he was on the cover of "Sports Illustrated"; he was the third racer on the downhill course, but fell hard and woke up in a toboggan. Two years earlier, Miller had competed in two events at the 1954 World Championships in Åre, Sweden.
Born and raised in Hanover, New Hampshire, he raced for hometown Dartmouth College and won the NCAA overall skimeister title in 1951 and in 1957.
In 1955, Miller set a speed skiing world record of in Portillo, Chile. He first went to Chile four years earlier, one of the first American ski racers to off-season train in South America. The speed record stood for fifteen years. 
Miller served in the U.S. Army's Mountain Training Command in the mid-1950s, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1961 and later taught at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington. His wife, Pam Miller, was the mayor of Lexington for ten years.

Matt Berkey

Matthew Berkey (born January 29, 1982) is an American professional poker player from Leechburg, Pennsylvania who focuses on live no limit hold 'em cash games.
Early life.
Berkey grew up in Leechburg, Pennsylvania with two siblings and aspired to be a baseball player. His parents struggled financially and were separated. His family received help from his grandparents. By the age of 13 Berkey moved in with his grandparents who pushed him in the right direction. In his youth, Berkey earned the nickname "Eeyore", the donkey from "Winnie the Pooh".
Originally, Matt Berkey wanted to become a professional baseball player. He even had a chance to take baseball scholarships from colleges, but he turned those opportunities down because of the distance from his hometown.
Berkey attended Gannon University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. While he started playing poker in high school, playing against friends for quarters, it was college where he decided to take the game more seriously. His newfound passion was a product of the Moneymaker Boom.
He went to his closest Indian Casino where he started to grind live cash games, and after graduating from college, Berkey chose his poker career over baseball.
Poker career.
Berkey plays online under the nickname "berkey11". Berkey finished 43rd in the 2010 World Series of Poker. He was knocked out shortly after being crippled by Jonathan Duhamel's boat.
In 2013, Berkey finished 3rd in the $3,000 No-Limit Hold'em Six Handed event for $199,733. Berkey won the 2015 $25,000 No Limit Hold'em High Roller event at the Aria Casino in December 2015 earning $315,180.
In May 2016, Berkey finished 5th in the $300,000 Super High Roller Bowl earning $1,100,000.
In 2017, Berkey was regularly seen playing live televised cash games. He finished 5th in 2017 World Series of Poker $1,500 Six-Max No-Limit Hold'em earning $87,141. Berkey started his own poker academy called Solve For Why. The academy intends on hosting a charity event in March 2018. Berkey appeared on Poker After Dark in November 2017 where he lost a $459,000 pot to poker player Garrett Adelstein while holding against Adelstein's . The board came giving both players a set. Both players went all in on the river.
As of 2018, Berkey's total live tournament earnings exceed $3,900,000.
Poker Projects.
Matt Berkey is the founder of ""Solve For Why", a Poker Academy. He has also announced in 2021 the creation with Tom Wheton of "Above The Felt entertainment"", a marketing agency for poker, in collaboration with Daren Elias, Chris Moneymaker, &amp; Jamie Kerstetter.

Ibn al-A'lam

'Alī ibn al-Ḥusayn Abū l-Qasim al-'Alawi al-Sharif al-Husayni ,(), (Baghdad, died 985 CE), was a 10th-century Arab astronomer and astrologer.
Very little is known about Ibn al-A'lam's life, and even his birth date has not been established by historians. Despite this fact, he seems to have been one of the most prominent astronomers of the 10th century, demonstrated by the big impact he seems to have had on both Islamic and Byzantine astronomy. From the little that is known about him, he appears to have been active in Baghdad, working under the patronage of its Buyid ruler, 'Adud al-Dawla (978–983). His Nisba "al-Alawi al-Sharif" indicates that he was a Sharif and a descendant of Ja’far al-Tayyar.&lt;br&gt;
Ibn al-A'lam's main work, a Zīj, was named after his patron "al-Zīj al-'Aḍudī", and was alternatively known as "al-Zīj al-Sharīfi" , or "al-Zīj al-Baghdādi". While the work itself is now lost, scholars were able to somehow reconstruct most of it based on later citations and references in Arabic, Persian, and even Greek sources.
Ibn Yunus, the renowned Egyptian astronomer of the 10th century, was also a contemporary to Ibn al-A'lam, whose work he praised and regularly cited. Even after Ibn al-A'lam's death, his influence remained for at least three centuries as evidenced by the tables of Maragheh observatory which were largely based on his work and that of Ibn Yunus.

Pyaar Zindagi Hai

Pyaar Zindagi Hai (transl: Love is Life) is a 2001 Indian Hindi-language romantic thriller film directed by Vijay Sadanah. It is a remake of Tamil movie "Aasai" (1995). Starring Ashima Bhalla, Vikas Kalantri and Mohnish Bahl in the lead role. The film produced by K.C. Bokadia, under the banner of BMB Pictures.
Plot.
After the marriage of his daughter, Geeta, with army Major Pratap Singh, widower Hridaynath lives a simple middle-class existence with his unmarried daughter, Priya, in Dehra Dun. Geeta, Pratap and their new-born son, Munna, pay them a visit and live with them for a few days. They find out that Hridaynath is under constant threat from a loan shark he had borrowed money from to get Geeta married. Shortly after that Geeta and Pratap leave back home for Ranikhet, and it then that Hridaynath finds out that his loan has been repaid and that they also have a telephone now - thanks to Pratap. Quite unknown to Hridaynath, Pratap has set his eyes on Priya and wants her for himself, so much so that he is willing to kill Geeta and get re-married to Priya on the pretext that Munna needs looking after. So to get the ball rolling, he kills Geeta by drugging and then suffocating her with a polythene bag. He then informs her dad and sister that she has died of a heart attack, and convinces them to leave Dehra Dun and live with him in Ranikhet. This is where he plans to seduce Priya in order to marry her and vows no one can dare to come in his way.
Unfortunately for him, Priya has a fiance Amit that she loves very much and she introduces him to Pratap. Frustrated, Pratap sets out to destroy Amit's character. First, he takes advantage of a careless Sikh man in their way and deliberately arranges for them to bump into him and steals Amit's wallet in the ensuing melee. Predictably when Amit notices his wallet missing, he confronts the Sikh man and makes a fool of himself, as it is Pratap who has the wallet. When he suspects and attempts to frisk Pratap, Hridaynath chastises him and Pratap escapes. Pratap also tries various means to defame Amit like getting his thugs to beat up Amit and forcibly pouring liquor in his mouth and leaving him looking drunk on the road. Pratap even kills Priya's dog that Amit has gifted. Finally Amit complains to Pratap's army boss, Lt. Col. Jagat Khanna, who then subsequently catches Pratap nuzzling against Priya's photo lovingly, and realizes that Amit is speaking the truth. He chastises Pratap and asks him to watch it and also casually inquires about Geeta's death. It is clear that Lt. Col Khanna no longer holds Major Pratap in esteem. Pratap fearing exposure, kills Lt. Col. Jagat Khanna with his car during one of his early morning jogs.
Finally Pratap decides to implement his final move—he frames Amit for drug trafficking and gets him arrested. He then consoles the sad Hridaynath and smoothly weaves in his request to marry Priya to care for his child. Disappointed with Amit and impressed with what he sees as a loving son-in-law, Hridaynath readily agrees, to Pratap's glee! Pratap then visits Amit in prison and boasts about his dastardly plan to destroy Amit, seduce and marry Priya and its successful conclusion culminating in Hridaynath's blessing. Simultaneously, Hridaynath and Priya discover the dead Geeta's letter warning about Pratap's lust for Priya and fear of her life. Hridaynath also discovers Pratap's diary which lays out the plot entirely. They try to leave, but Pratap returns, notices the letter and diary in open view and knocks Hridaynath unconscious when he confronts him. He tries to sexually assault Priya, but Amit who escaped from prison rescues her and beats Pratap unconscious. When Pratap awakes, Hridaynath has filled the room with explosive propane gas and threatens to blow them both up with a match, unless Pratap suffocates himself to death exactly as he did to Geeeta, with a polythene bag and string that Hridaynath has provided. Pratap pleading pathetically fails to move Hridaynath and puts the bag over his own head and ties the string around his neck tight. Unable to bear the suffocation, he rips the bag off, when Hridaynath lights the match and detonates a deadly blast, killing them both.
The movie ends with police releasing and apologizing to Amit and him reuniting with Priya after this horrific family tragedy.
Release.
"Pyaar Zindagi Hai" opened in theatres on 7 September 2001. It grossed over ₹11,00,000 lakh (US$16,929 dollars) worldwide. The film collected in the opening week.

The 1892 United States presidential election in Alabama took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. Alabama voters chose eleven electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Alabama was won by the Democratic nominees, former President Grover Cleveland of New York and his running mate Adlai Stevenson I of Illinois. However, Weaver performed well in the South as he won counties in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas. Populists did best in Alabama, where electoral chicanery probably carried the day for the Democrats.

Leilani Farha is a Canadian lawyer who is the Global Director of THE SHIFT, a housing initiative. Between June 2014 and April 2020, she was the United Nations special rapporteur on adequate housing.
Career.
Farha is a lawyer and an alumna of the University of Toronto, and has been an Executive Director of Canada Without Poverty.
United Nations special rapporteur on housing.
In her tenure as Special Rapporteur, she has focused on economic inequality and an absence of effective political representation for the poor as causes of homelessness or inadequate accommodation. Farha campaigns for the right to adequate housing for marginalized groups, she worked in Canada to implement United Nations resolutions that see homelessness as a violation of human rights. Farha has taken part in missions worldwide to examine the condition of housing rights and to develop policies to implement those rights.
Views.
Leilani Farha told "The Guardian" about the Grenfell Tower fire. Farha fears tenants' human rights were breached because they were not sufficiently involved in the way the building was developed, notably safety issues, before the fire and are not sufficiently involved in the investigations after the fire. Farha stated, "I’m concerned when I have residents saying to me they feel they are not being heard and that they are not always being treated like human beings. Those are the fundamentals of human rights: voice, dignity, and participation in solutions to their own situations." Lack of safety over cladding used, over electrical circuits and access to the building for fire and rescue vehicles could have breached human rights to safe and secure housing, Farha stated.
THE SHIFT.
Leilani Farha was a pioneer in launching THE SHIFT in 2019 as a new global movement to claim and realize the basic human right to housing; SHIFT encourages individuals and businesses to consider housing not exclusively as a place to invest excess capital, but to consider providing housing facilities as a place for people to live with dignity, raise families and participate more actively in the community. After leaving her position as UN Special Rapporteur, she became the Global Director of The Shift organization.
SHIFT pursues its goals with the partnership of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Cities Local Government.

DWA LVT/S

DWA LVT/S is a diesel multiple unit for regional traffic with low-floor entry.
History.
In 1996, Deutsche Waggonbau designed the double-decker DBAG Class 670, which, however, did not satisfy its operational requirements. As an alternative, the DWA developed the single-deck railcar "LVT/S" (DBAG Class 672), which was designed to be more robust and suitable for full-track use. With the acquisition of DWA by Bombardier Transportation a further construction was omitted as well as an extension of the vehicle range to a control car or a twin-railcar variant.
Service.
In 1998, some vehicles were used by the "Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn" on the Friedberg-Friedrichsdorf railway line because the ordered GTW 2/6 could not be delivered on time.
19 vehicles have been used by the Burgenlandbahn in Saxony-Anhalt since 1999 (as of 1 July 2008). The vehicles are stationed in Weißenfels.
Originally the vehicles were called KEG VT 3.01 to VT 3.18. Since the takeover of the vehicles by DB Regio in the year 2004 they are listed as 672 series. In the inventory there are the vehicles 672 901 to 904, 906 to 911 and 913 to 920. 672 912 is parked after a fire and 672 905 was retired on 27 November 2014. From April 2006 to December 2006, the vehicles were not used because of a damage of the frame for safety reasons until their renovation. Since March 2012, 672 919 and 920 have been stored as pre-production models. They have solid shafts for which there are no test instructions that meet the requirements of the Federal Railway Authority (EBA).
Due to a redesign of the VT 2E of the Frankfurt-Königsteiner Eisenbahn (as well as the Butzbach-Licher Eisenbahn, a subsidiary of the Hessische Landesbahn), three units of this type were used from 2006 to 2007 on the Königsteiner Bahn. These came from Bombardier and were on loan. In the meantime, they belong to the Hanseatische Eisenbahn.
In December 2011, the Städtebahn Sachsen rented a vehicle from Bombardier, which was mostly used between Pirna and Neustadt in Sachsen. In the meantime, the vehicle has been repainted and operates since December 2012 on the lines won by the Eisenbahngesellschaft Potsdam in the Prignitz.

Robert Yerkes House

The Robert Yerkes House is a single-family home located at 535 East Base Line Road in Northville, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
History.
William Yerkes, one of the first settlers in the Northville vicinity, arrived in the area in 1826. William's son Robert was born in 1829 and spent most of his life as a farmer. However, in the late 1860s, Yerkes decided to move to Northville so that his children could gain a better education. In 1869, he contracted with John C. Macomber to build this house. Yerkes moved into it in 1870, and lived there until his death in the 1910s. Yerkes's descendants continued to own the house until at least the 1970s.
Description.
The Robert Yerkes House is the best and most unmodified example of the Gothic Revival cottage architecture which was popular in the Northville area during the latter part of the 19th century. It is a two-story frame building with a one and one-half story wing, sitting on a cut granite foundation. The building is clad with clapboard, and the original windows are four-over-four units. The Gothic style is characterized by the two highly ornamented gables on the facade and the scroll saw work on the eaves and on the front porch.

The book tells the tragicomic story of attempts by visiting British art appraiser Henderson Dore, in New York City and the Deep South, to negotiate the cultural differences between British and American approaches to conducting business.
Reviewing the novel for "The New York Times", Caroline Seebohm said: "Mr. Boyd has some funny and perceptive things to say about English shyness as opposed to American spontaneity... But the author seems also to latch on to what are now fairly well aired differences between the English and Americans – pronunciation, for instance, and that old cliche about Americans ruining whiskey with ice... The major scenes in "Stars and Bars" take place in Luxora Beach, a place of unremitting bleakness and despair. Mr. Boyd's talent in evoking a place, which worked for him so well in his earlier two novels, serves him brilliantly here. In fact, the reader is forced to ask why on earth Henderson, wimpish though he is, does not get out when he can... The point about Henderson's liberation from his roots is well taken, and his adventures through the jungle are amusingly narrated, but the 'new clarity' with which he views the world at the end remains, for the reader, a lingering fog".

Necropolises of Pydna

There are some Macedonian tombs and the necropolises of Pydna around ancient Pydna and beside the ancient road from Methone in the north to Dion in the south. The oldest tombs are from the Bronze Age; the youngest are from the early Christian period. Smaller tumuli have eroded over time and are no longer visible. Most excavations have had to be carried out to save the sites. The finds in both areas show a shrinking population during the second Greek colonization.
Locations.
Numerous tombs from different periods have been discovered around the ancient city. An extensive northern necropolis and smaller necropolises are in the west and south (), as well as individual graves and burial mounds. Ancient customs required cemeteries to be placed by access roads and near city gates.
Graves.
Among the necropolises, changes in style and funeral rites can be observed over centuries, and different types of burials can be seen among the graves. In a few cases, bodies were cremated, but most were buried. Toddlers were often buried in common clay pots, which were broken up and, after embedding the body, rejoined. In some cases, cremated bodies were also buried in copper kettles or clay pots. The dead were either burned directly in the grave or a wooden platform was built for this purpose. During the 5th century BC, male corpses were buried head-west, female bodies head-east. In the skulls of many deceased, the so-called Charon's obol was found, placed under the tongues of the dead to pay the ferryman Charon for transferring the soul to Hades. During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, burials were the rule, and cremations were even rarer than in the Classical period. Remains of wooden coffins indicate that they were painted in blue and red. Graves from the mid-4th century BC are smaller than those created before or after, which archaeologists attribute to hard economic times.
The form of the graves goes from a simple pit over enclosed graves to Macedonian and Thracian tombs with dromos and several chambers. In part, the patterns of the arrangement of graves suggest their use as family tombs. The most elaborate design embodies the monumental Macedonian tombs, the two most significant of which are located in Korinos. The soils of the simple graves were sprinkled with gravel or sand. Stone slabs or, more often - as stones are rare in the environs of Pydna - wooden boards covered the graves. Single square tombs testify that the remains of the deceased were reburied later. Six of the discovered tombs were built in the Mycenaean style, which was unusual in Pieria.
Burial objects.
Many objects have been found within the graves. In addition to pottery, jewelry, weapons, and tools, richly decorated glass vessels have been uncovered. The clay vessels were mainly imported from Attica, in rarer cases also from Corinth or other places around the Aegean; some are also from local production. In children's graves, clay figures have often been found. The pieces of jewelry are usually made of bronze, iron, or silver; less often, they are made of bone or gold. In the graves of the male deceased, weapons have been found only in rare cases. The small vessels of glass or alabaster, which are attached to the corpses of women, are usually in good condition. Some of the finds are exhibited in the archaeological museum in Makrygialos, the largest part being stored in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.
Northern necropolis.
Located at the juncture of three ancient roads, some 3,000 graves from the Classical and Hellenistic periods have been discovered. This is the largest and most intensively used burial ground. The youngest graves are used until the year 146 BC. Since the graves are mainly in agricultural areas, they were mapped, photographed, and after the grave goods were removed, filled with soil again. The vast part of the northern necropolis still remains uncovered and the land is currently used by farmers to grow crops. Only monumental individual graves are still open, protected against weather by roofs.
The simple graves were mostly untouched when archaeologists found them, in contrast to the Macedonian burial mounds, which were often already looted during antiquity.
A burial mound some 500 meters north of the ramparts of ancient Pydna contained tombs from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Most of them were spared by grave robbers. Within the graves were rich grave goods; the women had been given valuable glass vessels and gold and silver jewelry; in the men's graves were swords, lances, helmets, and drinking vessels.
Southern necropolis.
Near the salt mines of Kitros lie the graves of the southern necropolis of Pydna. It is much smaller than the northern cemetery, but the tombs are more magnificent. Archaeologists assume that the wealthier inhabitants of Pydna were buried here. The excavations began in 1984 and were stopped in 2003 after several breaks. To date, 83 graves have been uncovered, but they form only a part of the southern necropolis. The oldest graves date back to 350 BC, and the last burial places are dated to 146 BC. They thus represent the largest period of burial culture from the ascent to the fall of the Macedonian kingdom.
The graves can be dated in three phases:
Most of the graves were still untouched, and inside the looted graves, non-metallic objects remained; the grave robbers were obviously only interested in precious metals (possibly also in weapons). Noteworthy is the grave of a physician, whose grave goods were his medical instruments.

Jenckes Spinning Company

The Jenckes Spinning Company is a historic textile factory complex in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Located on Conant and Weeden Streets, the complex was developed between 1883 and 1919, and was home to the city's largest employer in the 1910s, producing cotton fabric and fabric for use in automotive tires until 1933. The factory complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
Description and history.
The Jenckes Spinning Company factory is located about west of downtown Pawtucket, on in the shape of a rectangle with one corner cut off. It is bounded by Conant, Pine, and Weeden Streets, and includes nine buildings, seven of which are historically significant. All are of brick construction typical of late 19th and early 20th century textile mills, and range in height from one to six stories. Notable architectural features include the sawtooth roof on the facility's former weaving sheds, which front on Weeden Street.
In 1872, Edwin Jenckes, by then a successful supplier of equipment to textile manufacturers in Walpole, Massachusetts and Pawtucket, established a company with textile maker Nathaniel Hicks, as a vehicle for the manufacture of patented ring travellers. In 1883, the company took on the name "E. Jenckes Manufacturing Company", and acquired a portion of the land now making up the plant. The company's earliest buildings were built that year, but were demolished in 1915-16. The company was successful in manufacturing textile-making equipment, and soon expanded into textile production itself. In the 1910s, the company developed a heavy cotton duck fabric that could be dipped in rubber for use in automotive applications. The company was closed down in the 1930s after a series of acquisitions, and the property was purchased by the city and subdivided for other uses.

Anatoly Aleksandrovich Vaneyev (, Arkhangelsk – , Yermakovskoye village, now capital of the Yermakovsky District in the Krasnoyarsk Krai) was an active participant of the revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire.
Biography.
Anatoly Vaneyev was born in the family of an official. He went to the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology. Being a student he participated, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin, in the creation of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and its activities. He supervised the technical preparation of the publication of the newspaper "Rabocheye Delo". He also took part in the hectography of Lenin's 1894 work "What the "Friends of the People" Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats".
In December 1895 he was arrested and, in 1897, banished to Eastern Siberia. In exile, he married Dominika Trukhovskaya. In the late summer of 1899 he signed "A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats", directed against the so-called "economists".
He died shortly after, in September, from tuberculosis, which he contracted during solitary confinement in prison, prior to his banishment.
The son of Anatoly and Dominika was born three weeks after his death and was named Anatoly, like his father.

Investigation of diving accidents

Investigation of diving accidents includes investigations into the causes of reportable incidents in professional diving and recreational diving accidents, usually when there is a fatality or litigation for gross negligence.
An investigation of some kind usually follows a fatal diving accident, or one in which litigation is expected. There may be several investigations with different agendas. If police are involved, they generally look for evidence of a crime. In the US the Coastguard will usually investigate if there is a death when diving from a vessel in coastal waters. Health and safety administration officials may investigate when the diver was injured or killed at work. When a death occurs during an organised recreational activity, the certification agency's insurers will usually send an investigator to look into possible liability issues. The investigation may occur almost immediately to some considerable time after the event. In most cases the body will have been recovered and resuscitation attempted, and in this process equipment is usually removed and may be damaged or lost, or the evidence compromised by handling. Witnesses may have dispersed, and equipment is often mishandled by the investigating authorities if they are unfamiliar with the equipment and store it improperly, which can destroy evidence and compromise findings.
Recreational diving accidents are usually relatively uncomplicated, but accidents involving an extended range environment of specialised equipment may require expertise beyond the experience of any one investigator. This is a particular issue when rebreather equipment is involved.
For every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of "near miss" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. Ideally these will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future.
Reasons for investigation.
Professional diving accidents are usually investigated when a reportable injury occurs in terms of occupational health and safety legislation. The purpose is generally to allow avoidance of recurrences of the circumstances leading to the incident if practicable, and where relevant, to establish whether there was fault attributable to any involved party, which could lead to criminal or civil charges.
Accident investigation may help to identify the cause of a specific accident. If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings.
Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident.
Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur.
General procedures.
The victims of diving accidents are generally recovered or rescued by other divers in the vicinity. It is unusual for a diver to be left underwater with no immediate attempt at recovery, so in situ forensic investigation is seldom applicable, and the investigation usually relies on the accounts of witnesses. Different people may make different reports and develop different opinions about what happened. It is not unusual for people with less knowledge and understanding to misinterpret what they have seen and investigators need to gather as much information as reasonably possible to improve the chance of getting accurate information.
Recommended autopsy procedures have been summarised by specialists in diving fatality investigations and are available as guidelines to reduce the risk of overlooking pertinant evidence by pathologists less experienced in diving related autopsies.
There are three parts to a fatal accident investigation.
Most marine incident emergency response and accident investigation protocols have been written to manage surface incidents. These protocols are often inadequate for discovering the facts that could improve diving safety, and there is often a lack of cooperation between investigators and stakeholders in the outcomes of investigations.
It is not usually necessary to dive to inspect the site of a diving accident, but sometimes there are unusual environmental features which make underwater inspection desirable.
Recreational diving accidents.
A large proportion of recreational divers use a personal decompression computer to monitor depth, time and decompression status. These generally log a dive profile by recording depth and time at regular intervals, and this data can usually be downloaded or inspected on the instrument. This usually constitutes a reliable and objective record of the actual dive profile, and is normally admissible as evidence. Accuracy may vary depending on calibration. In some cases assistance from the factory may be needed to recover the data.
to be expanded
Professional diving accidents.
Professional diving on scuba also frequently uses dive computers as dive profile recorders. The data logged by the computer can be useful in determining the details of the dive profile and interpreting the sequence of events, particularly where there is no communications recording available.
to be expanded
Commercial diving accidents.
Surface supplied diving usually uses a diver intercom system to provide voice communications between the diver and supervisor, both for management and control of the dive, and for safety, as the supervisor can monitor the condition of the diver by hearing the breathing sounds. It is standard procedure for many (possibly most) contractors to record the voice communications of the dive and retain them for at least 24 hours, or longer in the case of an incident. These recordings are usually available as evidence in an official investigation. Surface supplied divers do not generally carry personal decompression computers, as depth profile is monitored from the surface, and decompression is controlled by the supervisor, who will log changes in depth as and when they occur.
to be expanded
Preservation and disclosure of evidence.
Failure to identify, preserve, and produce critical evidence such as dive computer data can result in sanctions against the responsible party, including findings in favour of the party requesting the lost information. Investigators without a sufficient knowledge of diving equipment have been known to destroy or lose critical evidence through mishandling of equipment, even when it survived rescue and recovery efforts.
In US Federal law the owner of equipment that logs data during an incident that may be the subject of litigation is obliged to preserve that data and make it available as evidence if the case comes to court at a later date. Litigants are required to find out what they have and disclose everything relevant to the opposition.
Detailed checklists and standardised report formats have been developed for use by investigators to minimise the risk of missing important evidence and of compromising the evidence. These are available for open-circuit and rebreather equipment.
Special procedures for rebreather equipment.
Although all cases where a diver dies while wearing a rebreather are classified as rebreather fatalities, this does not necessarily mean that a rebreather equipment problem was a contributory factor to the death of the diver. Not much is known about the root causes of these accidents because many investigations were inadequate and such findings as exist are often not made public. This makes it difficult to objectively improve the equipment, procedures and training so that the faults and errors are not repeated.
The most common equipment tests in rebreather incidents include examination of the equipment, scrubber testing, oxygen consumption tests, work of breathing measurements, checks on electronics and sensors, and tests of modifications where present. Equipment problems are the trigger for a large percentage of incidents, though equipment failures are less common. Procedural and human-machine interactions are a significant factor in rebreather incidents, and more common than in open circuit diving.
In the European Union, breathing apparatus for underwater use is a category III product, meaning that failures are potentially lethal. The harmonised standard for diving rebreathers is EN 14143-2003, so rebreathers will be checked against that standard.
The appropriate tests depend on the condition of the unit and the specifics of the case. As a general rule the first items are to download the logs from dive computers and breathing apparatus following the manufacturer's specifications.
The assembled rebreather's exterior is checked and photographed, and the gas content of the counterlung is sampled and analyzed. Although there are many possibilities for the counterlung gas to mix with the surroundings, a finding of a low oxygen content may indicate hypoxia if there is no evidence of an alternative cause of low oxygen levels. The content of the cylinders is also measured and analysed and the cylinders, regulator and check valves inspected. The work of breathing is measured on the appropriate equipment.
The unit is dismantled and the sensors, electronics and battery are tested, and the scrubber inspected. After cleaning, disinfecting and reassembly, the unit is test dived, in case there is some subtle problem that can be detected by an expert user, such as buoyancy, weight distribution and performance in various orientations. Ergonomics and performance implications of any customisation will be checked. All results are recorded, and photographs taken at various stages of the procedures.
Causes of diving accidents.
Causes of diving accidents are the triggering events that when combined with inadequate response, lead to an adverse consequence which may be classified as a notifiable incident or an accident when injury or death follows. These causes can be categorised as human factors, equipment problems and environmental factors. Equipment problems and environmental factors are also often influenced by human error.
The risk of injury varies with the mode and classification of the dive. In recreational diving it is generally possible for a diver to make several errors of judgement or calculation without adverse effects. More technical dive profiles may be less tolerant of error to the extent that a single error may be life-threatening, so technical divers tend to carry and use equipment to mitigate such possible errors, and to use and practice procedures known to reduce the risk of committing such errors. Professional diving is generally required to have a risk as low as reasonably practicable, and this implies the use of equipment redundancy, procedures known to minimise risk, and the availability of support personnel and equipment on site to mitigate reasonably foreseeable incidents.
Human factors.
Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time. The consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause significant harm, but others can have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Inexperience and lack of competence are the commonest root causes of diving fatalities. Inattention and negligence are known to be common contributory factors in diving accidents, and have been the root cause of some accidents.
Physiological factors.
A wide range of physiological factors may trigger or contribute towards a diving accident. The causes of death or serious injury in diving accidents include drowning, lung overpressure accidents, decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and trauma due to impact with boats. These are usually the final effect and may be combined, though the usually the cause of death is attributed to just one of the causes. Acute oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, hypothermia and squeezes (barotrauma) may also be primary causes of diving accidents.
Physiological triggering events that may lead to a diving accident, but are not generally the direct cause of death include nitrogen narcosis, dehydration, exhaustion, hypothermia, excessive work of breathing, motion sickness and the effects of alcohol and recreational drugs. Occasionally side effects of medical pharmaceuticals may also trigger an accident. Epileptic seizures should not occur, as a history of epilepsy is a bar to diver training, but cases have occurred where the problem was not disclosed and the person subsequently died as a result of drowning after losing their air supply during a seizure. These factors are often overlooked in accident investigations, and this may lead to a misleading conclusion about the cause of death.
Problems not directly related to diving may also cause death while diving, such as a cardiac event or stroke, possibly triggered by the physical effort of a difficult situation. These causes may be overlooked and the death inaccurately ascribed to drowning.
Drowning may be the most common reported cause of death in diving incidents. However, an autopsy listing drowning as the cause of death may not have established the reason for drowning, and autopsies on diving accident victims require a specific set of procedures to detect evidence of other possible causes. Drowning has been reported as the default finding in water related deaths where other causes were not detected, and may be erroneous. A properly equipped diver following recommended practices, diving in an environment compatible with their competence and in good health should not drown. When drowning is the direct cause of death it has usually been the final stage of a cascade of incidents which at some stage got out of the diver's control and culminated in drowning. The sequence of events is relatively difficult to establish and requires an understanding and familiarity with the equipment and procedures which may not be known to the investigators. This lack of clarity can lead to inappropriate litigation.
Psychological factors.
In a high risk environment, as is the case in diving, human error is more likely to have catastrophic consequences. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities.
Procedural factors.
Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress.
Equipment issues.
Most diving equipment is quite rugged and very reliable when correctly maintained and tested before use, but almost anything can fail and cause a problem for the diver. Some failures are merely an inconvenience, but others can be immediately life-threatening, so part of diver training is how to manage those failures which constitute an immediate risk to health or life. These are generally failures affecting breathing gas supply and buoyancy. Failures of environmental protection are generally not immediately life-threatening to recreational divers, who are able to abort a dive and surface at any time, but are more serious for divers with decompression obligations, or are unable to surface because of a physical overhead barrier, or dive in extremely cold or polluted water. Loss of buoyancy is less of a problem to surface supplied divers as they have a lifeline and do not easily run out of gas, but an uncontrolled ascent can be dangerous even when there is technically no decompression obligation. For a scuba diver, loss of breathing gas and buoyancy together can be deadly.
Out of gas incidents.
A high proportion of scuba accidents involve running out of breathing gas. However, in the majority of these cases there is no equipment failure, or a minor equipment failure is mismanaged. Out of gas incidents are immediately life-threatening underwater, and all divers are trained in mitigation procedures. Recreational divers who rely on a dive buddy to supply gas in an emergency are expected to carry a secondary demand valve and remain close enough to their buddy to provide gas without delay in an emergency. Alternatives to gas sharing are to make an emergency ascent to the surface, a procedure implicated in a large proportion of fatalities, or to carry an independent alternative gas supply. Solo and rebreather divers follow this latter strategy, and technical divers may choose to carry bailout gas or use a scuba configuration that reduces the risk of a complete loss of gas in the event of most scenarios, at the cost of greater skill requirements and task loading. Professional scuba divers may be required to carry bailout gas. 
The submersible pressure gauge is extremely reliable, and seldom fails catastrophically without warning, though they can be inaccurate at low pressures. Occasionally a hose bursts due to immediate or accumulated damage, and a low pressure hose burst can empty a cylinder in a few minutes to seconds depending on the contents of the cylinder, while also making the remaining gas unavailable to the diver. Unrecoverable free-flows are rare, but occasionally occur, and regulator freeze can cause a free-flow which can only be stopped by closing the cylinder valve. More commonly, a diver will use up all the gas without noticing until the pressure is critically low. A common complication of loss of breathing gas supply is that the same gas supply is routinely used for breathing and buoyancy control in recreational scuba diving.
Surface supplied divers are generally obliged to carry sufficient bailout gas to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails, and this is usually activated by opening a valve on the helmet or harness that is in easy reach of both hands. Unsurprisingly, the number of out of gas fatalities in surface supplied diving is very low.
Breathing gas quality problems.
Contamination of the breathing gas will have effects that depend on the concentration, the ambient pressure, and the specific contaminants present. Carbon monoxide produced by overheating of the compressor, or by contamination of the intake air by internal combustion engine exhaust gas is a well known risk, and can be mitigated by using hopcalite catalyst in the high pressure filter. Contamination by carbon dioxide is unusual in open circuit breathing apparatus, as natural air usually has a low enough content not to be a problem at the ambient pressures of most dives. It is a relatively common problem for rebreathers, as the metabolically produced carbon dioxide in the exhaled gas must be removed chemically by the scrubber before the gas can be breathed again. Scrubber breakthrough can occur for a variety of reasons, most of them connected to user error, but some more likely due to design details of the specific unit. A slow buildup of carbon dioxide can usually be noticed by the diver in time to bail out, but sometimes the concentration can rise so rapidly that the diver is incapacitated before being able to bail out.
Use of breathing gases other than those planned for the current depth range of a dive can have undesirable consequences. The oxygen concentration of a gas may be toxic or insufficient to support consciousness if used at an inappropriate depth, and the inert gas components will not be correctly accounted for in decompression calculations, which might result in decompression sickness. Both oxygen toxicity and hypoxia may render the diver unconscious without warning, and decompression sickness symptoms may be debilitating if severe, and are generally unexpected.
Breathing apparatus malfunctions.
Open circuit scuba is generally very reliable if correctly maintained and serviced, and tested before the dive. Maintenance and testing procedures are simple and few in number, nevertheless divers may neglect them due to complacency, distraction or incompetence.
Rebreather scuba is considerably more complex than open circuit scuba, and the number of failure modes is much greater. The complexity of routine maintenance, pre-dive setup and pre-dive testing are such that documentary checklists specific to the equipment model are strongly recommended by experts. Electronically mediated predive check sequences are available on some electronic closed circuit rebreathers, but even these occasionally fail to detect a latent problem.
Surface supplied diving equipment may provide a constant flow or demand regulated gas supply. The surface gas control panel allows alternative gas supplies to be connected if the primary supply fails, and a further backup supply is generally carried by the diver. This multiple redundancy reduces the number of ways the gas supply to the diver can be critically compromised, and further mitigation is provided by the standby diver, who can also supply emergency breathing gas. As a consequence, surface-supplied divers are very seldom critically affected by breathing gas supply failure.
Buoyancy problems.
Insufficient buoyancy is a problem for divers who must ascend through the water column without assistance from a lifting platform, a surface tender, or something they can climb. This effectively limits the problem to freedivers and untethered scuba divers. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive can prevent the diver from surfacing before breathing gas runs out, cause the diver to sink to an unintended depth or cause a diver at the surface to be unable to stay afloat. Insufficient buoyancy at the end of a dive is usually due to diver error in carrying too much weight or to a major failure of the dry suit or buoyancy compensator (BC or BCD). Insufficient buoyancy at the start of a dive can also be caused by carrying too much weight, but can also be due to a poor match between mass of gas carried and volume of buoyancy compensator, which is usually only a problem with technical divers, who may start a dive with a relatively large mass of gas. A major flood of the dry suit can cause a sudden large loss of buoyancy at any time during a dive. A properly trained and equipped diver will be able to correct this either by BC inflation or weight shedding. Divers are trained to manage problems of insufficient buoyancy due to equipment malfunctions, and to adjust their weighting to suit the equipment used for a specific dive. The consequence of uncompensated insufficient buoyancy is usually drowning. Almost all fatalities due to insufficient buoyancy can be ascribed to diver error if the diver was conscious and able to act at the time that the problem was noticed.
Excessive buoyancy can be a problem for any diver who is constrained from making a direct uncontrolled ascent. It is a hazard for all divers who breath underwater at ambient pressure, as a rapid ascent can cause decompression illness. Excessive buoyancy at the start of a dive is usually caused by insufficient weighting, which is diver error. Loss of ballast weights can occur at any time during a dive, and can have various causes, depending on how the weights are carried, including voluntary shedding of too much weight in a perceived emergency. A third cause of excessive buoyancy, which develops during a dive and usually manifests at the end, during the ascent, is insufficient weighting to compensate for the mass of gas used during the dive. This can be almost always be ascribed to diver error, and usually occurs when a diver miscalculates the buoyancy increase due to gas usage, and does not carry sufficient weight to compensate. It is a common problem when unfamiliar equipment is used without a checkout dive with the cylinder nearly empty. Divers will often accept the recommendations for weighting given by the dive shop supplying the equipment, or base their weighting on similar equipment used in the past. For recreational divers who do not exceed the no-stop limit, this is seldom seriously harmful. At worst the ascent rate may be a little fast near the surface and they will be unable to do a safety stop, but for divers with a significant decompression obligation, it can have more serious consequences. Surface supplied divers who plan a dive with long decompression obligations usually carry weights which cannot easily be removed, to reduce the risk of accidentally losing them and becoming uncontrollably buoyant. The other common cause of excessive buoyancy which can occur at any time in a dive, is excess gas in the dry suit or buoyancy compensator. This can be caused by several factors, some of which can be classed as diver error, and others as equipment malfunction, but divers are trained to deal with these malfunctions as they are reasonably foreseeable, so failure to correct them when they occur is also generally a diver error in the wider sense.
Buoyancy compensator malfunction has been implicated in a significant number of fatal incidents, usually due to a problem with the inflator mechanism, but in some cases the BCD could not stay inflated. In most of these fatalities, the buoyancy compensator was not used competently, usually by over-inflation which caused an uncontrolled ascent, or deflating when more buoyancy was required at the surface. Overweighting can also be classified as misuse of equipment. Inability to inflate the buoyancy compensator can also occur when the diver runs out of breathing gas, as the breathing gas supply is generally the inflation gas supply. This can complicate an emergency ascent, particularly if the diver is not immediately aware of the implications relating to buoyancy of breathing gas loss.
BCD blowups can occur when the inflation valve sticks open. In most cases this can be quickly corrected, either by pulling the valve closed or by disconnecting the LP inflation hose, and if the system has a low flow rate when fully open, this is seldom a major problem, as it is possible to dump air faster than it flows into the BCD. However, some inflator systems have a high flow rate, and if these valves stick fully open, the diver may not be able to dump fast enough to prevent being dragged upwards, at which stage a positive feedback of expansion of gas already in the BCD and possibly also the suit may become unrecoverable. Attempts to fin downwards against the buoyancy are likely to trap gas in the BCD and suit. Ascents are safer if the diver is trimmed feet down and shoulders high to facilitate dumping from both suit and BCD.
Double bladder BCDs are used by some technical divers as a backup in case the primary fails by not retaining air. This can happen if the inflation hose tears or comes off, or the bladder has a major puncture near the top that cannot be compensated by trim. The problem with this form of equipment redundancy occurs when the diver inadvertently inflates or deflates the wrong bladder. It is also possible for the inflation valve of a secondary bladder with low pressure inflation supply to malfunction and leak gas into the bladder without the diver's input or knowledge, and the diver then finds it impossible to dump sufficient gas from what they mistakenly believe to be the inflated bladder. This risk can be avoided by not connecting a pressure supply hose to the inflator for the secondary bladder, by having a distinctly different style of inflator mechanism, by mounting it on the other side of the diver to the primary inflator, and by never using it underwater while the primary bladder is functional. The other way of managing this problem is to mount the two inflator valve units together, and basically always assume that both bladders have gas in then, so always dump from both at the same time. This may be problematic if the diver needs to deflate while inverted and the lower dump valves are not positioned to allow simultaneous operation.
If a dry suit is worn, the dry suit can be inflated as a substitute for the BCD in an emergency, but a dry suit is not well suited to operate at a good trim with a large amount of gas inside, and the risk of a runaway inverted ascent is significant. Remaining upright and ascending without delay is most likely to avoid complications.
Divers who carry a delayed surface marker buoy (DSMB) can use it to signal the surface that they are ascending, and use it to positively control depth and ascent rate once deployed, by maintaining some tension in the line. The equipment is considered an important safety aid, but deployment is a period of relatively high risk, as if the line snags and stops unrolling the buoyancy may be sufficient to drag the diver up far enough to cause the expansion of the suit and BCD to get out of control, and if the diver lets go of the DSMB it will be lost. A spare DSMB and spool may be carried in case of this contingency. The risks of deploying the DSMB with the reel clipped to the diver are considered unacceptable by some, and this practice has been implicated in fatal accidents.
Hazardous tools and activities.
Underwater cutting and welding activities involve the use of live electrical conductors exposed to the water in the close proximity of the diver using them. Electrocution is possible, though unlikely to be fatal. as the voltages are fairly low. They also involve extreme heat and the generation of explosive gases, which may accumulate under obstacles to their free escape, and may detonate, causing pressure trauma to the diver. Stringent precautions are required for using this equipment, including training in the appropriate procedures. Nevertheless, accidents occasionally happen. The equipment used and injuries manifested are pointers towards possible triggering events.
Professional divers are often required to assist with the lifting and placement of large, massive objects underwater during the course of their employment. This exposes them to hazards of impact, pinching and crushing. Trauma caused by such incidents is usually obvious and easily identified. In some cases the triggering incident is a lapse of procedure, other times it may be an unexpected environmental effect, though seldom unforeseeable. Occasionally a failure of properly tested, inspected and operated equipment may occur. Negligence is often contributory to such accidents. Recreational divers are usually not sufficiently trained to safely perform these tasks, and are at greater risk. Entanglement in a runaway buoyant lift is a hazard specifically of working with lift bags, and particularly when filling them with breathing gas from scuba cylinders carried by the diver. Filling a lift bag at depth can deplete the gas supply in a cylinder rapidly, so a dedicated cylinder should be used when this work must be done on scuba.
High pressure water-jetting injuries are usually easy to recognise. Investigation of incidents involving such injuries is likely to include identifying procedural causes, or occasionally equipment malfunction, which may also have a procedural cause.
Explosives are used underwater by commercial divers for demolition and to power tools to attach bolts to a structure. They may also be encountered by divers in the form of unexploded munitions of various ages and unknown stability. 
Autopsy findings.
Drowning is death resulting from hypoxemia caused by asphyxiation by immersion in a liquid. It is very often the direct cause of death in diving accidents, but usually follows a series of events triggered by an event which need not necessarily have been fatal. Drowning is a diagnosis of exclusion, it is appropriate when other possibilities have been ruled out. In scuba diving drowning is usually the consequence of running out of breathing gas at depth or under an overhead barrier to a direct ascent to the surface, but can aso occur as a consequence of loss of consciousness for any one of a variety of reasons followed by a compromised airway. In breathhold diving it usually occurs when the diver loses consciousness or reaches a state of hypercapnia severe enough to cause involuntary inhalation before reaching the surface. The airway of a surface supplied diver is usually protected by the helmet or full-face mask, and consequently these divers should survive a loss of consciousness if rescued while a suitable breathing gas supply is available.
Arterial gas embolism requires overextension and rupture of lung tissue, which in a healthy diver, can occur on ascent. A sufficient overexpansion of the lungs requires a simultaneous decrease in depth and failure to release gas from the lungs, so that the blood-air interface is ruptured while there is sufficient overpressure to force gas into pulmonary blood vessels against local blood pressure It can also be caused by some lung pathologies. 
Decompression sickness requires supersaturation of tissues during the decompression of ascent, and bubble formation is affected by ascent rate and the amount of gas dissolved in the tissues during exposure to pressure while breathing. Presence of tissue bubbles during autopsy is not necessarily an indication of DCS as gas will come out of solution when a body is decompressed by recovering to the surface. Dive history as recorded by a personal dive computer or bottom timer can indicate a probability of gas bubbles being a consequence of decompression sickness, lung overpressure induced arterial gas embolism or an artifact of post mortem recovery decompression.
Paradoxical gas embolism – venous blood with bubbles which would be asymptomatic if filtered through the pulmonary circulation passing through a patent foramen ovale into the systemic circulation during exertion during ascent or after surfacing, and then lodge in critical tissues where they may grow by diffusion processes. Divers are often unaware of a PFO, and there is not generally a requirement to be tested for PFO for recreational or professional divers as it is not a disqualification for diving.
Cardiovascular disease: The most common natural disease process associated with diving fatalities. Often sudden death is the first indication of cardiovascular disease, but sometimes the diver had known problems but chose to continue diving. In divers older than 35 years cardiovascular disease is second only to drowning as the primary cause of death, and is frequently implicated in drownings.
Carbon monoxide poisoning is rare, but occasionally occurs due to contaminated breathing gas. Partial pressure in the breathing gas is increased in proportion to depth, and concentrations that might be tolerated at the surface could be lethal at depth. Breathing gas tests can confirm or exclude the presence of carbon monoxide in toxic concentrations.
Mechanical trauma is usually obvious when it is the direct cause of death, but it is possible for less obvious injury to cause a short term reduction in the level of consciousness sufficient for the diver to be unable to avoid drowning, or to hinder the diver from taking the necessary action.
General findings.
The direct cause of death is not usually the ultimate aim of the investigation. A finding of drowning, gas embolism or decompression sickness by the autopsy opens the question of why that happened, and whether it could or should have been avoidable. The equipment, procedures and training associated with diving are specifically intended to prevent drowning, barotrauma and decompression sickness, and a fatality caused by one of these is an indication that the system failed in some way. To be useful in preventing similar incidents, it is necessary to find out how and why the system failed. In non-fatal accidents, this is the primary purpose of the investigation.
Buddy separation is frequently associated with recreational diving incidents. This can be interpreted to indicate that the buddy system as commonly practised by recreational divers is flawed. Either the divers are not effectively adhering to the buddy system as specified by the training agencies, or the circumstances of the dive were beyond the capacity of the divers to remain together, which implies that the divers were not technically competent to perform that dive. This problem is exacerbated by arbitrary pairing of strangers to dive as buddies by dive professionals who are not familiar with the competence of the divers beyond the certification they have produced when booking the dive. The dive professionals are usually indemnified by a waiver/release that the divers are required to sign as a condition of service, leaving the divers vulnerable to the consequences of being paired with an incompetent or negligent buddy, or buddies who have been trained in slightly different procedures, and may be unfamiliar with each other's equipment and intentions. The reaction to this problem includes the two extremes – The DIR philosophy of strict adherence to a standardised system of procedures and equipment, and not diving with anyone who does not use the same system, and the self-reliant route, where the diver elects to dive as if on their own, not relying on the buddy for assistance, and carrying sufficient equipment redundancy to manage reasonably foreseeable incidents unaided. These divers may choose to dive solo rather than be burdened by a buddy of unknown competence or known incompetence, but may be obstructed in this choice by legislation or terms and conditions of service.
A common finding in recreational diving is human error, most often of the victim. In some cases the diver was not competent for the specific activity due to lack of appropriate training, in others the scope of the training was appropriate but the diver 's skills were insufficient at the time. Even when equipment problems are involved, they are usually due to human error, either by misuse, failure to check functionality, or inappropriate reaction to a problem. In professional diving, although there are considerably more safeguards required, and the incidence of accidents is lower, human error remains a major contributor, but it is sometimes error by other members of the dive team.
Competence of investigators.
Fatal scuba diving accidents are uncommon, fatal surface-supplied diving accidents are even less common, and training of forensic investigators and pathologists does not generally include the relevant skills and specialist knowledge. Specialist workshops have been run to provide a better understanding of diving physiology and pathophysiology, epidemiology, gathering of pertinent history, familiarization with dive equipment, modification of autopsy protocol, interpretation of the findings, and determination of the most likely cause of death.
Near miss reports.
For every incident in which someone is injured of killed, it has been estimated that a relatively large number of "near miss" incidents occur, which the diver manages well enough to avoid harm. In many cases these can be ascribed to inherent hazards of diving, and the responses which compensated for the hazardous event are standard diving procedures, correctly and promptly applied, but there are also situations where something unforeseen, not immediately explicable, or previously considered highly improbable, occurs. Ideally these incidents will be recorded, analysed for cause, reported, and the results made public, so that similar incidents can be avoided in the future. This tends to happen more consistently in professional diving, where occupational health and safety concerns are more closely monitored, and in organisations with an established safety culture.

Victor and Valentino

Victor and Valentino is a Mexican-American animated television series created by Diego Molano for Cartoon Network. It is produced by Cartoon Network Studios. Molano later stated his excitement in putting the "spotlight on Aztec, Olmec, and Maya mythologies" and in having more representation, calling the show "a baby step" in letting Latinos feel they are "part of this tapestry that’s America." Molano also called the series "a supernatural adventure comedy with some action elements," and stated that he loves how he can explore his "favorite subject" (mythology) by focusing on "Mesoamerican mythologies of pre-Hispanic indigenous people of the Americas."
On March 30, 2019, the show was greenlit for a full TV series, premiering simultaneously in the United States and Latin America. On July 15, the show was renewed for a second season which premiered on April 18, 2020. In February 2021, the show was renewed for a third season which premiered on September 4, 2021.
Synopsis.
In the small quiet town of Monte Macabre, two total opposite half-brothers search about the town for adventure and find strange and supernatural happenings with the help of their supernatural grandmother.
Promotion, production, and release.
The idea for the show originally started as a thesis project titled "High Noon in Mexico" in 2002 by Molano when he was a Maryland Institute College of Art student, where Victor and Valentino were part of a video game, along with a third brother named Vicente. In 2004, the idea took the name of "Victor, Valentino and Vicente." Years later, he revisited the project when interning for Titmouse, where he worked after graduating from MICA, and worked as a "clean-up artist" on "Superjail!".
Being a Latin American folk-themed show, its pilot episode premiered directly on the channel on October 29, 2016 (two days before their local Day of the Dead). In this pilot, Molano voiced Victor, and planned on finding someone else. However, he decided to, ultimately, voice Victor in the main show. He later stated that he was, as a kid, just like Victor, thinking he could "do no wrong," and hoped the show would give a "good lesson for kids."
The main show itself, is produced at Cartoon Network's studio in Burbank, California. Molano noted that this is where all the writing, storyboarding, pre- and post-production is done, with 36 people working on pre-production, while the main production of the animation is done by two studios based in Seoul: SMIP Co., LTD. and Digital eMation, Inc. He further noted that the visual inspiration from the show comes from "Mesoamerica’s beautiful, ancient art styles." In 2019, Molano expressed some of the challenges with producing the show. This included condensing "large, epic scale, sometimes adult-themed myths/stories" into 11-minute episodes and making them "digestible content rated for kids." He was inspired to borrow from "storylines from indigenous cultures all around Mesoamerica" in an attempt to bring them into the "US cultural imaginary." The art directors of the show, two brothers, Josh Parpan and Justin Parpan, who had worked on "Gravity Falls" and "DuckTales" respectfully, added their perspective. Their work allowed the "culturally-specific world for the series" to be constructed, which they showcased on a Tumblr blog titled "Folk Art Friends – The Art of Victor and Valentino." In an interview with "Cartoon Brew", they expressed the need to "do something new and different artistically," and immersed themselves in "a variety of Latin American art," with many forms of inspiration.
Broadcast.
The show first broadcast on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and Latin America on March 30, 2019, part of the channel's 2018-2019 programming lineup. The show premiered on Cartoon Network UK on 26 August 2019. It then premiered on September 23 in Italy with episodes 1x7 and 1x12 and then officially premiered in October 7 with regular episodes. It also aired on Cartoon Network India on 1 November 2019.
In October 2020, Cartoon Network commemorated Hispanic Heritage Month with an "ongoing content series that celebrates equality and individuality," which was narrated by Sean-Ryan Petersen, who voices Valentino, and features a "variety of powerful youth activists." In addition to this, fans were encouraged to stream Victor and Valentino episodes, and those of other series, in Spanish on the Cartoon Network App.
Home media.
The first 18 episodes of the series was released as a DVD titled "Victor and Valentino: Folk Art Foes," on March 2, 2021 with a total running time of about 143 minutes and language options in Spanish and English.
Reception.
The series has been reviewed positively. Remezcla described it as show with "Gravity Falls" vibes and something that aims to give Latino kids an "entertaining look at the folktales and myths that populate the American continent." Common Sense Media called the show a "comedy adventure series" based in a town which is a "setting for all kinds of supernatural oddities inspired by Latin American folklore." Other reviewers concurred. The "L.A. Times" called the show a "supernatural action comedy," and praised its "mix of Mexican visual motifs and Japanese anime conventions," saying it makes for "something new, yet familiar." Gizmodo described the show as the first series on Cartoon Network "starring a predominantly Hispanic cast" and praised the matter-of-fact, casual approach to "indigenous, Mesoamerican culture." The reviewer further stated that the show has the space to do worldbuilding while "letting its supernatural elements sometimes take the backseat" and called it a "clever, good-hearted show." In the same fashion, "Collider" stated that the animation is "a rare title that offers up something new," that it welcomes "viewers of Mesoamerican backgrounds," shares a lot with "OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes", and is a series that is "fun and funny enough for kids" while offering stories "worth watching for audiences of any age." Similarly, "Deadline" argued that the show gave off "some fun-filled" "Steven Universe" and "Rick &amp; Morty" vibes.

Reid Concert Hall

The Reid Concert Hall is a small music venue in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located in the south-western corner of Bristo Square about south of the Royal Mile, and is part of the University of Edinburgh. Originally opened in 1859 as the Reid School of Music by the university's professor of music, John Donaldson (1789-1865), it was designed by the Scottish Architect David Cousin and is a Category A listed building. The hall is named after General John Reid, an army officer and musician who founded the Chair of Music (Reid Professor of Music) at the university. The Reid Concerts take place every 13 February.
Performances.
The Reid Hall is hosts a number of classical chamber music concerts throughout the year, mostly performed by students and academics. The Reid Concerts are performed every year under the organisation of the Reid Professor. They are held on 13 February in remembrance of General John Reid and in line with the terms of his bequest that established the professorship.
In its history a number of works by Kenneth Leighton were premiered at the Reid Hall. After the composer's death, the hall hosted a memorial concert performed by Wakefield Cathedral Choir.
During the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Reid Hall is used as a performance venue called "The Cowbarn" by Underbelly.
Architecture.
The Reid School of Music is a tall, rectangular sandstone ashlar building, designed by David Cousin in an Italianate Neoclassical style. The exterior large sash windows are flanked by decorative shell-headed niches. The roof is surrounded with an ornate, dentilled cornice and heavy, bracketed eaves, below which is an inscription carved into the frieze, "". Steps lead up to the entrances, which are flanked by pairs of classical columns and topped with porticos.
The interior consists mostly of a spacious concert hall, which is noted for its highly decorated neoclassical coffered tunnel vaulted ceiling. Against the east wall of the concert hall is a reproduction classical organ, which was built by Jürgen Ahrend in 1978. The wooden casing was designed by James Haig Marshall of Ian G Lindsay and Partners. The concert hall was designed to offer "dry" acoustics with low reverberation. By contrast, the neighbouring McEwan Hall opened in 1897 is a grand, colossal space with high reverberation.
Music museum.
When the Reid Hall was built, Professor John Donaldson (1789-1865) also added a museum gallery to display his private collection of old and unusual musical instruments. The Reid Hall is considered to be the oldest purpose-built musical museum in Europe. Today, the North Room houses the John Donaldson Collection of Musical Instruments, which, along with the Russell Collection, forms part of the Musical Instruments collection of the University of Edinburgh.

Zen From Mars

Zen From Mars (often abbreviated as ZFM) is an American alternative rock band formed in 2015 by members of Kik Tracee, Enuff Z'Nuff, Flipp, and Fear Factory.
Background.
Formation.
The band was founded by Bang Tango guitarist Drew Fortier, who after demoing songs for what was intended to be Bang Tango's next studio album, decided that the songs would be better fit for a whole different project; which led to Fortier forming the group with Kik Tracee vocalist Stephen Shareaux, then recruiting bassist Chip Z'Nuff, drummer Mike Heller, guitarist Brynn Arens, and pianist Kate Catalina to complete the line up. In early 2016, the band met in Chicago, Illinois for a photo shoot as well as a music video shoot resulting in videos for the tracks "New Leaf", "Aflame", and "Downtown". Currently "New Leaf" has been the only video released.
Recording.
Recording of the band's debut album began in October 2015. Due to the fact that everyone in the band resides in different parts of the country, each member would self produce and record their parts at their respective home studios. Recording for the album was finished in the Summer of 2017. As of October 2017 the album, "The Ultra Head Frequency", has been in the process of being mixed and mastered by Richard Easterling for a TBA 2018 release date.
Live.
Although the full band has yet to make its live debut, Zen From Mars co-founders Stephen Shareaux and Drew Fortier began performing acoustic shows around the country with a setlist made up of material from Shareaux's former band Kik Tracee, Shareaux's solo album "Golden" as well as stripped down renditions of Zen From Mars songs. Some notable appearances include performing multiple sets at the grand opening of Megadeth bassist David Ellefson's "Ellefson Coffee Co." in Jackson, Minnesota, as well as opening for Mark Slaughter's solo band at Dingbatz in Clifton, New Jersey, and performing a co-headlining set at Herman's Hideaway in Denver, Colorado with the now late ex-Faith No More vocalist Chuck Mosley, with whom Fortier was also guitarist for, and is currently doing a film on.
Releases.

1982 UK Athletics Championships

The 1982 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Cwmbran Stadium, Cwmbran. It was the second time the event was held in the Welsh town, following on from the 1977 UK Athletics Championships. The women's 5000 metres race walk was dropped from the programme for this championship.
It was the sixth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1982 AAA Championships.
David Ottley extended his unbeaten streak to five straight UK titles in the javelin throw. On the men's side, Steve Barry (racewalk), Graham Eggleton (pole vault), Peter Gordon (discus throw) and Martin Girvan (hammer throw) also defended their 1981 UK titles. Fatima Whitbread was the only woman to repeat her victory, doing so in the javelin. No athlete won multiple titles at this edition, though Mike McFarlane and Bev Callender both won the 200 metres title and were runners-up in the 100 metres.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1982 European Athletics Championships. Reflecting the secondary status of the UK event at national level, none of the British individual medallists there were present at UK Championships, though four relay medallists were on the UK podium: Bev Callender, Shirley Thomas, Todd Bennett, Phil Brown. The four countries of the United Kingdom competed separately at the Commonwealth Games that year as well, and UK champions who won there were men's 200 m champion Mike McFarlane, men's racewalker Steve Barry and women's shot putter Judy Oakes.

Better Set Your Phasers to Stun

Better Set Your Phasers to Stun is a 2009 EP by the American synthpop/electropop group Hyperbubble. The recording was in collaboration with the Welsh band Helen Love. The title tracks cover Love's 2000 song with the "Star Trek" reference. The cover art furnished images of the series' signature phaser weapon.
Release history.
The album was released twice. It debuted as a CD and digital download on July 1, 2009. The EP was the first release by U.K. label Bubblegum Records. The issue included a sharply different variation of Hyperbubble's "U.F.O. Party Beach", produced on the earlier album "Tribute to John Williams" from Winter Records and retitled, "Beach Party U.F.O." Further remixes retitled as "U.F.O. Beach Party" debuted on "Candy Apple Daydreams" and "Candy Apple Nightmares" to slightly mixed reviews.
The last track "Disgow Glasgow" included a live segment from a May 5, 2008 concert at the bar and club Box in Glasgow. The song itself was recorded at a place owned by Murray Ramone of the Scottish punk band Shock and Awe in Edinburgh.
The CD was reissued in 2014 under the Socket Sounds label as "Better Set Your Phasers To Stun – The Next Generation". The album replaced the last two tracks with new mixes of the title song.
The release consisted of a hand-numbered edition of one hundred copies, twenty-five of which were sold via Facebook. The remainder were sold at a multi-band concert at The Lexington hosted by Helen Love that was recorded for their "Live in London" album. It featured an "amusing" version "Better Set Your Phasers To Stun" by Hyperbubble.
All versions of the title song on both releases included a vocal track furnished by Love of their 1995 single "We Love You", except the "Suspended Animation Ambient Mix." This track was described as "all but [dispensing] with the original tune and provides a pleasing atmospheric break [on the CD]." It was included along with "Disgow Glasgow" in their 2017 compilation, "Pretty Plastic".
Critical reception.
The EP had a generally positive reception by critics, with Connexion Bizarre awarding it seven out of ten stars. British publisher tasty fanzine concluded that the listener "will either love this or seriously hate it [as] it's right at the most synthetic and twee end of the synthetic tweepop stick." The music was variously described as "infuriatingly catchy", "new wave/synthpop confection" and "retro fun and bouncy throwaway pop music."
The last two tracks are stylistically different from the rest of the EP; one critic suggested that the differences made the songs "more universally enjoyable (albeit in a nonsensical manner)." A detractor panned "Beach Party U.F.O." as "too sweet for most people," while the "slightly darker electro" "Disco Glasgow" was lauded for its danceability.

Peter Tschentscher

Peter Tschentscher (born 20 January 1966) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Since 28 March 2018 he has been the First Mayor of Hamburg and head of the new state government. Since 2008 he has been a member of the Hamburger Bürgerschaft, the state parliament of Hamburg. From 2011 until 2018 he served as State Minister of Finance of the city in the Senate's Scholz I and II.
Early life and education.
Tschentscher graduated from high school in Oldenburg in 1985. He later studied medicine and molecular biology at the University of Hamburg, where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1995. From 1994 until 2008 he practised as a physician at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.
Political career.
Tschentscher joined the Social Democratic Party in 1989. He was first elected to the Hamburgische Bürgerschaft in the 2008 state elections. From 2008 until 2011 he served on the Budget Committee. In addition, he led a parliamentary inquiry into cost overruns in the construction of the Elbphilharmonie from 2010.
Finance Senator, 2011–2018.
During his tenure as State Minister of Finance Tschentscher oversaw the privatization of the publicly owned shipping finance provider HSH Nordbank.
From 2015 on, Tschentscher was one of the state's representatives at the Bundesrat, where he served as deputy chairman of the finance committee.
First mayor of Hamburg, 2018–present.
In March 2018 Tschentscher succeeded Olaf Scholz, who left state politics to become Federal Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor of Germany in the fourth coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
At the time of his nomination, Tschentscher was seen as a surprising choice by many, as he has not appeared much in the public during his term as Senator of Finance. Andreas Dressel, SPD parliamentary group leader in Hamburg, had been considered by many as obvious successor of Scholz, but declined for personal reasons.
As one of the state's representatives at the Bundesrat, Tschentscher is a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and on the Committee on European Affairs. During his first year as mayor, he also served as Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation.

Deandre Baker

Deandre Lamar Baker (born September 4, 1997) is an American football cornerback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs and was drafted by the New York Giants with the 30th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.
High school career.
During his time at Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Baker was an All-American Sprinter and participated in the 4 × 100 metres relay on the second leg.
College career.
Baker signed with Georgia on national signing day, despite speculation that he would sign with Texas based on a tweet he sent out the night before. As a true freshman at Georgia in 2015, Baker played in 11 games. During the 2016 season, Baker was injured in a game against Vanderbilt. He recovered, but was later injured against Georgia Tech. Following the 2017 season, Baker was named to the Second Team All-SEC. Baker considered declaring for the 2018 NFL draft, but he ultimately elected to return to school for his senior year.
Baker was one of the best defensive backs in college football in his senior season. He allowed only 175 yards and a 40.2 NFL passer rating to opposing receivers in 2018, which both ranked in the top 5 of all draft eligible cornerbacks with a minimum of 300 coverage snaps. He was named a consensus 2018 All-American and won the Jim Thorpe Award, awarded to the best defensive back in college football. Over his entire 4-year tenure at Georgia, Baker only allowed one touchdown. Baker entered the 2019 NFL Draft as one of the best defensive back prospects.
Professional career.
New York Giants.
Baker was selected by the New York Giants in the first round, 30th overall, of the 2019 NFL Draft. The Giants had traded up with the Seattle Seahawks to acquire the pick giving up their 37th, 132nd and 142nd picks.
Baker was placed on the commissioner's exempt list on July 27, 2020, following his May 2020 arrest. The Giants waived Baker on September 8, 2020.
Kansas City Chiefs.
On November 19, 2020, Baker was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs' practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster on December 19, December 26, and January 2, 2021, for the team's weeks 15, 16, and 17 games against the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, and Los Angeles Chargers, and reverted to the practice squad after each game. Against the Chargers, Baker broke his femur on a non-contact play, becoming only the second NFL player to suffer a broken femur during a game. During the game, Baker recorded his first career sack on Justin Herbert. He was placed on the practice squad/injured list on January 12, 2021.
On February 9, 2021 Baker re-signed with the Chiefs.
Personal life.
On May 14, 2020, it was announced that a warrant had been issued for Baker's arrest under charges of armed robbery and aggravated assault with a firearm, along with Quinton Dunbar of the Seattle Seahawks. On May 15, Baker's lawyer issued a statement claiming that he was in possession of multiple affidavits allegedly exonerating his client. The next morning on May 16, 2020, both Baker and Dunbar turned themselves in to the police. The two allegedly robbed guests at gunpoint during a house party. On August 7, 2020, Broward State Attorney Mike Satz announced Baker was charged with 4 counts of robbery with a firearm, and he is facing 10 years to life in prison if convicted. Dunbar was not charged. There was evidence provided by the State Attorneys Office of Broward County Florida that the alleged victims accepted $55,000 in exchange for changing their story in regards to Dunbar. Despite the fact that the witnesses by their own testimony appear to be paid off, the State Attorney case filer, Alex Urella, still filed against Baker. On November 16, 2020 the charges against Baker were dropped.

Isabelle Evesson

Isabelle Evesson (c. 1870 – 1914) was an American actress.
Early life.
Isabelle Evesson was born in New York City, the daughter of Henry Evesson Jr. and Florine Augusta Bassford Evesson. 
Her sister Estelle Clayton was also an actress, as well as a playwright; she wrote "A Puritan Romance" as a vehicle for her sister and herself. In 1907, the sisters formed the Bassford Estate Corporation, hoping to recover compensation for some of their grandfather's extensive land holdings in the New York City area. "So, with the walls of their handsome apartment covered with old maps," explained a newspaper reporter in 1907, "these two Evesson sisters, year in and year out, are making their fight for untold millions."
Career.
Isabelle Evesson was performing on stage from her teens, often in touring companies and in Boston and Chicago. She spent two years acting in London. "Every act and gesture is finished," noted a Los Angeles newspaper of Evesson's performance in 1905, "and her voice is sweet and well modulated." Evesson's Broadway credits included roles in "Mr. Barnes of New York" (1888), "Papa's Wife" (1899-1900), "Anna Karenina" (1905), and "The Charm of Isabel" (1914). She was in the original 1887 cast of Richard Mansfield's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" at the Boston Museum. 
Evesson appeared in two silent films, "A Mother's Atonement" (1914), and "The Girl and the Bachelor" (1915). She was a charter member of the Professional Woman's League at their organizational meeting in 1892.
Personal life.
Isabelle Evesson married journalist Almyr Wilder Cooper in 1895; the Mayor of New York performed the civil ceremony in his office. Cooper died suddenly in 1896, from injuries sustained in an assault. Isabel Evesson died in 1914, at home in Stamford, Connecticut, in her forties.

1983 UK Athletics Championships

The 1983 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh. It was the second time the event was held in the Scottish city, following on from the 1978 UK Athletics Championships. The women's 5000 metres race walk was restored to the programme after an absence at the 1982 event.
It was the seventh edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1983 AAA Championships.
Three athletes, Steve Barry (men's racewalk), Martin Girvan (men's hammer throw) and Fatima Whitbread (women's javelin throw) took their third straight UK titles. Aston Moore defended his men's triple jump title, as did women's long jumper Beverly Kinch and hurdler Susan Morley. Kathy Smallwood-Cook and Buster Watson achieved short sprint doubles and Venissa Head won both the women's shot put and discus throw.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the inaugural 1983 World Championships in Athletics. Women's UK champions Fatima Whitbread and Kathy Smallwood-Cook went on to reach the world podium.

Rise and Kill First

Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations is a 2018 book by Ronen Bergman about the history of targeted assassinations by Israel's intelligence services. Its author says that Israel has assassinated more people than any other western country since World War II. It portrays the assassinations of British government officials, Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leaders, and Iranian nuclear scientists. To write the book, Bergman carried out about a thousand interviews with political figures and secret agents and consulted "thousands" of documents.
Synopsis.
"Rise and Kill First" describes the targeted killings carried out by Israeli secret agencies and the personalities and the tactics used. The book's title is inspired by a statement in the Talmud: "If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first". Based on a thousand interviews and thousands of documents, the book is the story of many political and intelligence figures such as agents of Mossad, Shin Bet, and the Israeli military, some of them speaking under their real identity. Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, former Israeli prime ministers, and Meir Dagan, a recent head of Mossad for eight years, were among those interviewed.
The book begins with the founding of Bar Giora in 1907 by Yitzhak Ben Zvi. The organization later became Hashomer, then the Haganah and finally the core of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). According to Bergman, Israeli covert agencies have undertaken targeted assassinations against "Arab adversaries throughout its pre- and post-statehood periods". They have assassinated more people than any Western state has since World War II, carrying out "at least" 2,700 assassination operations in the seventy-year period since Israel's state formation. "Poisoned toothpaste that takes a month to end its target's life, armed drones, exploding mobile phones, spare tires with remote-controlled bombs, assassinating enemy scientists and discovering the secret lovers of Muslim clerics," are among the methods described in the book used by Israel to carry out assassinations. Bergman discusses the assassination of British officials, Hamas, Hezbollah and PLO leaders, and Iranian nuclear scientists. According to the author, some of the assassinated individuals include: PLO leader Yasser Arafat; Ali Hassan Salameh, leader of Black September; Abu Jihad, Arafat's aide and co-founder of the Fatah party; Yahya Ayyash, known as the "Engineer", Hamas' chief bomb maker; and Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan waiter. Menachem Begin, Yitzak Shamir, Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon, the latter described by Bergman as a "pyromaniac", each of whom would later lead the government of Israel, are named as assassins in "Rise and Kill First".
Bergman describes the details of operations carried out in Iran, Egypt, Syria, and Germany. According to the book, Ariel Sharon mistakenly ordered Mossad to shoot down a plane, carrying 30 wounded Palestinian children, survivors of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. The operation was cancelled "at the last moment" after it was reported that Arafat was not on board. He "even" consented to the downing of a commercial plane if it was carrying Arafat, Bergman says in his book.
The book also recites secret favours carried out by the Mossad at the request of foreign governments and leaders, such as allegedly for king Hassan II of Morocco.
Reception.
According to Kenneth M. Pollack, a former CIA intelligence analyst, the book is "smart, thoughtful and balanced, and the English translation is superb", while it fails to "answer ... the problem of terrorism", and offers no end to it. Pollack describes the end of the book as showing targeted killing is like an addictive drug which just cures the "worst symptom (terrorism) of a terrible disease (Palestinian anger)" but does not cure the disease itself. The book is described by Ethan Bronner, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, as "the first comprehensive look at Israel's use of state-sponsored killings," and as a "meticulously researched book" by Charles Glass, an author, journalist, broadcaster and publisher specialising in the Middle East.
Research.
According to Bergman the Israeli secret services tried to intervene in his work, held a meeting in 2010 to disrupt his research and warned former Mossad employees against giving interviews to him.

Lü Jinghua

Lü Jinghua (; born 1960) is a Chinese dissident and activist, and was a key member of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation (BWAF) during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The BWAF was the People's Republic of China's (PRC) first independent trade union, established as an alternative to the Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Lü served as the union's broadcaster. After the June 4th crackdown, Lü was placed on China's most wanted list, and subsequently fled to the United States.
Early life and before Tiananmen.
Lü was born in Chongqing to Party loyalist parents. Her father had become a Party member before the establishment of the PRC in 1949, and her mother was a neighbourhood activist during the Cultural Revolution. Lü attended Yucai Middle School, where most of her classmates were the sons and daughters of People's Liberation Army officers. She attended art school for a year and then held a number of jobs, none of them lasting for long: in a trading company in Guangzhou, on a chicken farm in the countryside near Beijing, and, in 1986, as manager of a privately owned dress shop, also called a "getihu".
Role in Tiananmen Protests.
On her way to her dress shop located on Chang'an Avenue, Lü rode past Tiananmen on her bicycle every day, often stopping to watch protestors march past or to listen to student speeches. Although she was not very interested in politics, after the student-led hunger strike began on May 13, she started offering material support to the protestors by bringing food to various student pickets. In exchange, the students told Lü about their demands, democracy, and stories of Party corruption. As Lü recalled in the documentary The Gate of Heavenly Peace:
We workers and ordinary people had been looking on. Then, when the students started the hunger strike, using their own lives to awaken the whole nation, people felt their responsibilities, and they rose up too.
Lü began marching with the students soon after. On May 26, Lü offered her services to the recently founded Beijing Workers Autonomous Federation, initially collecting funds and aid from her friends at the dress shop. Lü was one of the only women to join the BWAF. After the students refused workers access to the central loudspeakers in the square, a broadcast station was set up in the BWAF headquarters near the western reviewing stand outside of Tiananmen. According to sociologists Andrew G. Walder and Gong Xiaoxia, the station became the most important aspect of the BWAF's presence on the square, broadcasting continuously from morning into the evening. Partially because of her booming and commanding voice, Lü became the voice for the union's public address system, reading documents submitted by ordinary workers, journalists, government office workers, and even Party cadres and soldiers. Lü read everything that was submitted including poems, manifestos, appeals for material support, song lyrics, open letters, announcements for demonstrations, and also told stories to inspire workers and bystanders.
She also helped produce handbills and leaflets using a portable mimeograph, purchased books detailing Party corruption, visited nearby factories to try and rally workers to support the students, and acted as the spokesperson for the BWAF from May 26 to June 3. In this latter role, Lü experienced first-hand the tensions between workers and students, claiming that on one occasion that when she attempted to talk to Chai Ling, Lü was turned away by students who "wanted to maintain the purity of their movement."
After , Lü helped destroy the lists of BWAF members before evacuating. On June 8, the Martial Law Command declared the BWAF an illegal organization, ordered it to disband, and designated its leaders as among "the main instigators and organizers in the capital of the counter-revolutionary rebellion." In the aftermath of the crackdown, when many members of the BWAF were arrested, Lü spent several weeks absconding: first hiding in a friend's apartment, before fleeing to Hebei Province in the northeast, where her husband was working (her husband, Li Zhilang, would serve seven months in prison for sheltering her after the crackdown). On August 19, she was placed on the Chinese government's most wanted list as a "major criminal who has not yet been caught," being the only female worker to be on the placed on the list. Eventually Lü reached Guangzhou. There, an underground railroad had been set up by Hong Kong activists and journalists, and, on August 23, she was able to slip across the border to safety in Hong Kong. In December 1989, five months after she applied for political asylum at the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, she arrived in Los Angeles as a political refugee.
Life after Tiananmen.
For a time she worked in a grocery store in Los Angeles, before moving to New York. Through her high-profile appearances and activism with human rights organizations, Lü came to the attention of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), who hired her in 1990. She worked as an organizer and educator with the ILGWU until 1996 when the organization merged the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to form the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. In 1996, she switched to building computer systems; today she sells real estate.
Since leaving China, Lu has campaigned extensively for workers rights and for democracy in China. In 1990, she met with US senators and the AFL-CIO to try and convince them to campaign for the release of Chinese workers, particularly those imprisoned in the aftermath of the Tiananmen protests. Also in 1990, she was honoured by Human Rights Watch for her efforts on behalf of imprisoned labour activists in China. As of 2017, Lü is serving as Vice Chair for the Chinese Alliance for Democracy, an organization founded in 1983 by Wang Bingzhang that advocates for human rights and the democratization of China.
Lü attempted to return to China in 1992 to see her mother and daughter, but was denied entry at Beijing Capital International Airport. In 1994, her daughter was able to join Lü in New York. When her parents died in 1998 and 1999, the Chinese government refused to grant Lü visas to attend their funerals.
In January 2011, Lü was one of the few exiled dissidents allowed to attend the funeral of Hong Kong activist and politician Szeto Wah in Hong Kong. In April 2016, Lü attempted to travel to India to attend the Interfaith Conference of China's ethnic and religious minorities, and to meet with the Dalai Lama, but was denied entry. She claimed that the Chinese government was a factor behind the cancellations, given both her role in the Tiananmen protests and the Chinese government's stance towards Tibet and the Dalai Lama. The Indian government denied this, however, arguing that Lü had applied for the wrong category of visa.

Lacon-Gunale

The Lacon-Gunale were an indigenous family of medieval Sardinia originally established in all the four thrones of the Judgedoms, the four Sardinian medieval kingdoms.
Origin.
Probably the Lacon and Gunale descended respectively from the last "dux" and "praeses" of Byzantine Sardinia, perhaps originating from the town of Laconi in Sarcidano and Gunale or Unale (no longer in existence, it was located in the countryside of Arzachena) in Gallura, which joined in a single family, that assumed the role of "Iudex provinciae" or Archon of Sardinia, residing in Caralis. From the 11th century, with the fragmentation of the island territory in Judgedoms, it divided into four branches.

Rimac Nevera

The Rimac Nevera (pronounced: ]) is an all-electric sports car designed and manufactured by the Croatian automotive manufacturer Rimac Automobili. The first production prototype car was released in August 2021. Rimac will produce 150 vehicles and is currently in the process of homologation for the global market. Nevera is manufactured in the same factory and at the same rate (of roughly 1 per week) as the Pininfarina Battista, which is based on the same platform. 
Unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show called Rimac Concept Two but renamed to Rimac Nevera upon its launch, it is the automaker's second car after the Rimac Concept One and is described as "the ultimate electric hypercar driving experience". 
The name Nevera comes from the Croatian word for sudden and short storms, usually accompanied by lightning, which occur primarily along the Croatian Adriatic coast.
Development.
The Rimac Nevera was initially revealed as the C_Two concept car. Since 2018, Rimac spent over three years refining the car as part of an extensive test and development programme. Almost all key components of the Nevera are designed and manufactured at Rimac's headquarters near Zagreb, Croatia.
During the global homologation process, the company constructed 4 prototypes for different testing purposes.
In June 2020, Rimac opened a new facility in Veliko Trgovišće which will serve as the assembly for Nevera homologation prototypes as well as future production vehicles for customers. At full capacity, the facility should produce 4 vehicles per month and currently plans to produce an additional 13 prototype vehicles by the end of 2020. The delivery of production cars to customers was initially planned in 2020 but was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Performance.
Each of the Nevera's four wheels is individually driven by surface-mounted magnet motors. Combined, they produce a total of 1914 hp and 2360Nm of torque. A single-stage gearbox links the front and rear wheels.
The Nevera allegedly has the ability to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 1.85 seconds, making it potentially the fastest-accelerating production car in the world. According to the Rimac Automobili, it will accelerate from 0-100 mph in 4.3 seconds, 0-186 mph in 9.3 seconds, and on to a top speed of 412 km/h or 256 mph.
On 13 August 2021, the YouTube channel "Drag Times" tested a pre-production Nevera at Famoso Raceway, Bakersfield, California. After making several runs down the mile track, the following performance results were published:
Features and specifications.
While also advertising a maximum range of on the NEDC cycle, and on the WLTP cycle, the car is also claimed to be able to complete two consecutive laps of the Nürburgring with a negligible drop in performance. Rimac claims the car was designed to be very durable and could be driven hard. In addition to this, the car is technologically capable of Level 4 of autonomous driving with full Advanced driver-assistance systems. If connected to a fast charger, it can be recharged to 80% in less than 30 minutes. The car features an entirely new design and does away with the conventional doors, now incorporating butterfly doors instead. It also has a fire extinguisher in the back held in by a leather strap embossed with the words "In case of hill climb, extinguish fire"; a reference to "The Grand Tour" host Richard Hammond who crashed a Concept One during a hill climb, causing it to catch on fire.
Reception.
Jonathan Lopez of "Top Speed" magazine acclaimed Nevera stating that "it is an absolute game changer, and not just in the EV segment. Between the onboard tech and mind-boggling performance specs, this machine has the goods to take on the best of the best."
Tom Ford of "Top Gear" tested the early prototype in March 2020, he praised the "punch out" in the corners despite the weight of the car, as well as giving plenty of feedback, concluding that "it tastes good raw, even without the torque-vectoring wizardry. ... But with a base car that shows this level of promise, and a company that focuses on fun rather than figures, this bodes well."
Vlad Savov of "The Verge" criticized its looks by describing them as "anonymous and unexciting", and comparing them as less flamboyant to that of Lamborghini Huracán. However, he admitted that the car is "more forgiving and accommodating than most other hypercars", but stated that the readouts on the infotainment were too distracting.
Production version.
"Top Gear" in its 2021 review of the production vehicle praised the "head spinning performance, incredible tech, ultra-stiff chassis, engineering and build quality" but noted that the brakes need getting used to and some detail finessing, giving it 9 out of 10. Chris Perkins, writing for "Road &amp; Track", called the acceleration "savage and unrelenting", noting that the "step up in performance between ‘quite fast’ and ‘so fast it makes breathing difficult’ is quite something", and ultimately calling it "the most advanced, most powerful, quickest car out there". Car and Driver had similar impressions in its review, stating that "hypercars like the Nevera aren't for everyone, but there's no denying its significance as the moment a battery-powered car toppled the Bugatti Chiron. The internal-combustion engine may never catch up". Robb Report journalist Ben Oliver noted in his impressions while driving the car that "the noise adds to the drama, as much psychological as physical, in a way no other road car can match, making for a dangerously charismatic split personality worth every one of its seven figures".

Red Riding Hood (1901 film)

Red Riding Hood () was a 1901 French silent film by Georges Méliès, based on the folktale "Little Red Riding Hood". Méliès's adaptation expanded and altered the Charles Perrault version of the story to allow for additional comedy and detail, as well as a happier ending than Perrault provided. In the film, Red Riding Hood is a high-spirited, adventurous daughter in a family of bakers in the French countryside, nearly eaten by a wolf during her journey to take a galette to her grandmother. Red Riding Hood is rescued by the bakery staff just in time, the wolf meets his end during a dramatic chase, and all return home victorious.
The film was distributed internationally, including in its native France by Méliès's Star Film Company, in Britain by the Warwick Trading Company, and in the United States—without permission from or credit to Méliès—by the Edison Manufacturing Company. The film is presently presumed lost.
Plot.
In a bakery in the French countryside, Father Latourte, his wife, and their staff are busy with customers, pastries, and baked goods of all kinds. The Latourtes' young daughter, called Red Riding Hood, reads by the firelight until her parents leave for a moment. She starts to play boisterously, getting the bakery staff mixed up in hijinks and pratfalls. Her father and mother return, chagrined by her escapades, and she is told to take a pot of butter and a galette to her grandmother's cottage. Red Riding Hood travels through the forest on her errand, meeting a wolf, who finds out where she is going. Encountering her friends from the village school, she happily pauses her journey to play and dance with them. Meanwhile, at a windmill near the cottage, the miller Sans-Souci has comic trouble with his mule.
The wolf arrives at the cottage, has a spirited fight with the grandmother, swallows her, puts on her clothes, and waits in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives, and in silent-film pantomime the famous dialogue ("Goodness, what big eyes you have!", "The better to see you with", etc.) takes place. The wolf is about to pounce on Red Riding Hood when the staff of the bakery, in search of the missing child, bursts into the cottage. Pandemonium breaks out as the wolf is chased all around the cottage and finally, with a shatter of glass, out a closed window. The bakers follow him through the forest, with country folk joining in the chase as it goes on. As the wolf crosses a bridge over a rocky gorge and a torrent, he is shot by a "garde champêtre". The wolf has an over-the-top death scene, somersaulting and tumbling, until the bridge breaks and sends him into the torrent. The wolf's body is pulled out of the river and carried off on a stretcher.
In the village square, a fête is in progress. Red Riding Hood's rescue procession comes back just in time to watch the great parade of village worthies, peasants, and schoolchildren through the square. The wolf's body is ceremoniously put on a spit and roasted. A spectacular apotheosis shows Red Riding Hood, in the pose of "Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon", skewering her enemy on a pedestal of enormous galettes and butter pots, surrounded by baking and cooking implements.
Production and release.
Méliès based "Red Riding Hood" on Charles Perrault's version of the story, expanding it with comedy and "picturesque episodes," and altering the plot to allow for a happy ending (in Perrault's telling, the heroine is eaten by the wolf). In the catalogue description of the film, Méliès emphasized the comic and "picturesque" ("pittoresque") nature of the adaptation, highlighting an onscreen scene change from the outside to the inside of the grandmother's cottage as a "beautiful stage machinery effect" ("joli effet de machinerie théâtrale").
The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 337–344 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a "spectacular féerie play in twelve tableaux" ("pièce féerique à grand spectacle en 12 tableaux"). The Warwick Trading Company handled distribution in Britain, where the film could be purchased either in black-and-white (for 18) or with hand colouring applied (for 36). To anglicize the film for British audiences, Warwick's publicity renamed Father Latourte to Mr Plumcake.
The Edison Manufacturing Company, taking advantage of what was then permissible under international copyright law, made its own prints of Méliès's film and sold them in the United States without Méliès's permission, claiming the film to be one of their productions.
"Red Riding Hood" is currently presumed lost.

Robert Davis (British politician)

Robert Jonathan Davis (born 27 September 1957) is a British lawyer and Conservative Party politician. He was deputy leader of the Westminster City Council, and chairman of its planning committee for 17 years. He served as Lord Mayor of Westminster 1996-1997 and also chaired the London Mayors' Association between 1998 and 2016.
Early life.
Robert Davis was born on 27 September 1957. He is the son of Gerald Davis (died 2000) and Pamela Davis née Lee (died 1997).
He was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, followed by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and Wolfson College, Cambridge, after which he trained as a solicitor at the College of Law in London's Lancaster Gate. He was admitted as a solicitor in October 1983. From 1985 to 2015, Davis was a partner (now a consultant) in solicitors' firm Freeman Box, Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, specialising in property law.
Political career.
Davis was first elected to Westminster City Council in 1982 for the Bayswater ward, before representing neighbouring Lancaster Gate from 1986 onwards. From 1996 to 1997, he was the then youngest Lord Mayor of Westminster. During his year of office, he participated in a number of events with Nelson Mandela during his state visit to the UK in July 1996.
Between 2003 and 2018, Davis served on a rota basis as one of a number of Lord Mayor Locum Tenens (deputising for the Lord Mayor). He was deputy leader of the council from May 2008 until March 2018. In addition, he served as Cabinet Member for the Built Environment (with responsibility for planning, major infrastructure projects and special events) from 2002 to 2017, and Chaired the Council's principal Planning Committee for seventeen years, from 2000 to 2017.
Davis also served as Cabinet Member for Business, Culture and Heritage between January 2017 and March 2018. Prior to this, he created West End Live in 2005, which has become an annual theatrical event. It originally took place in Leicester Square, but is now staged in Trafalgar Square each June, comprising fully costumed extracts from all the current West End musicals. Davis produced the event and raised all the monies necessary until he retired as a Cabinet Member in 2018.
As Cabinet Member for large infrastructure projects, he initiated and led on the project to make Baker Street and Gloucester Place two way, the public realm improvements to Bond Street and Hanover Square, and the public realm project around the Aldwych. He also oversaw the £21m rejuvenation of Leicester Square, and the regeneration of Piccadilly and Marble Arch.
As chairman of the council's principal planning committee, he was instrumental in persuading the developers of a site in Victoria to include a theatre in their development – now known as the The Other Palace – and in persuading Derwent London to build a new 650-seat theatre in Charing Cross Road (now under construction and due for completion in 2022, it is currently known as the "Nimax").
As Cabinet Member for Planning he introduced and led on the Council's "Design Excellence" campaign to improve the quality of architecture in Westminster. He also conceived the idea of "the City of Sculpture" Festival which persuaded sculptors and galleries to place large art work and sculptures throughout the City of Westminster, including down Park Lane and at Marble Arch. In 2017, Davis had the idea of a temporary theatre at Marble Arch and co-produced the musical "Five Guys Named Moe" at the theatre with Underbelly. He was also responsible for the Council's Green plaque scheme commemorating famous people and events, and their association with Westminster properties. Davis chaired the Westminster World Heritage Site Board between 2015 and 2018.
In July 2014, he was invited by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to become a member of an advisory committee established by the Government to support the erection of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Trafalgar Square.
In March 2018, following criticism of "the large scale of gifts and hospitality" received by Davis from property developers, he resigned as Deputy Leader of the Council and as a Cabinet Member to allow an internal independent inquiry to investigate the issues at his own request. He subsequently resigned from the Council in October 2018. At the time of his resignation, he was the borough's longest currently serving councillor, with a tenure lasting over 36 years. He was also the longest-serving Westminster councillor since the borough's formation in 1965.
Allegations.
On 7 March 2018, Davis stood down as deputy leader and as a cabinet member after "The Guardian" reported into him having received hospitality and gifts over 500 times between 2012 and 2017, much of it from property developers, during the period when he was Chairman of the Planning Committee. Davis enjoyed hospitality from leading property developers, including Gerald Ronson, Sir Stuart Lipton, Brian Bickell and Sir George Iacobescu. Council rules require that any gifts or hospitality valued at £25 or more must be declared, and Davis's register included trips to Switzerland, France, the US, and Scotland's Gleneagles Hotel and golf resort.
At Davis's request, Westminster's legal director investigated whether Davis had breached the council's code of conduct. The investigation was assisted by independent barrister James Goudie QC. It reported in October 2018, with Sir Stephen Lamport, who was independently overseeing the investigation, finding that Davis had "breached the code of conduct" whilst a councillor, and that his "acceptance of gifts and hospitality from developers before or after a planning decision may ... have placed him in a position in which people might seek to influence him in the performance of his duties." Lamport stated that there was no evidence of any inappropriate conduct or illegality, but the scale of the hospitality received by Davis was "extraordinary". Davis's official declarations revealed that he was the recipient of tickets to West End shows and invitations to what were described by "The Guardian" as "exclusive dinners in London's finest restaurants", as well as trips to the south of France. On one day in Mallorca, he managed two lunch meetings: the first at the home of theatrical impresario and Conservative peer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the second at the home of the Earl of Chichester. The number of times Davis received hospitality or gifts was in fact 893 – higher than had earlier been reported by the same newspaper. From the beginning of 2015, he was entertained by and received gifts from figures in the property industry over 150 times, which made such occurrences nearly weekly. "The Guardian" found that Davis received gifts or hospitality from property companies who were involved in half of the planning applications which his committee ruled on in 2016. According to Lamport, the high level of gifts and hospitality accepted by Davis "lay open his reputation, and therefore that of the Council, to a perception – fairly or unfairly – that called into question his personal responsibility to promote high standards of conduct". In his resignation statement, Davis said: "An inquiry has been completed by the council. They have confirmed that none of the declarations I made or hospitality I received influenced decisions I took as a councillor and that nothing I did was unlawful. However, they have concluded my actions nevertheless created a perception that was negative to the council. While I dispute this, I wish to draw a line under the matter. It is now time for me to move on to the next stage in my life and for the next generation of councillors to lead Westminster."
Other interests.
Between 1997 and 2016, Davis chaired the London Mayors' Association, an organisation comprising the current and former mayors of the 33 London Boroughs, which was originally founded in 1901. Davis turned the then moribund LMA into a successful and widely-recognised group. He was a director and trustee of the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park from 1986 to 2019, and Chairman of the Board between 2009 and 2019, during which time the venue won several theatrical awards, including Oliviers.
Together with his fellow Councillor Lady Flight, and other colleagues, he founded the Sir Simon Milton Foundation, a registered charity which was established after the death of Davis's partner Sir Simon Milton (lately Leader of Westminster Council, Chairman of the Local Government Association and Deputy Mayor of London and Chief of Staff to Boris Johnson as Mayor of London until Milton's death in 2011). The purpose of the charity was to continue to support Simon's priorities to address loneliness and isolation among older persons and to support young people into work through supporting their educational needs. The Foundation now runs Silver Sunday, a day held every October to support older people in meeting others by attending one of over 1,200 events throughout the country. The Foundation has also sponsored the establishment of the Sir Simon Milton Westminster University Technical College in Pimlico, and has distributed a number of bursaries and grants to students in financial need, including at Davis and Milton's own Cambridge College, Gonvile &amp; Caius. Davis is currently Deputy Chairman of the Foundation.
Davis is a trustee of the Savoy Educational Trust, a charity established by the Directors of the Savoy Hotel, which provides financial assistance to hospitality colleges and schools. [25] He is also a trustee of Mousetrap Theatre Projects, a charity that helps young people, including those with disabilities, to be able to go to West End theatre shows at a low cost. [26] In 2007, Davis helped establish the Westminster Guide Lecturers' Association, which awards authorised green badges to tour guides expert in the history of the City of Westminster who have passed an exam. Davis was its first Honorary President between 2007 and 2017. He has been the International Goodwill Ambassador of the London New Year's Day Parade since 1998, and between 2003 and 2018 organised the Westminster Council entry in the Parade, winning the Best Borough Entry seven times. He also served on the Board of the New West End Company (the Business Improvement District for Oxford Street, Regent's Street and Bond Street) between 2000 and 2011, and again between 2017 and 2018.

Elizabeth Spencer, Duchess of Marlborough

Elizabeth Spencer, Duchess of Marlborough ( – 7 October 1761), formerly the Hon. Elizabeth Trevor, was the wife of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough.
Early life.
She was the daughter of Thomas Trevor, 2nd Baron Trevor of Bromham, Bedfordshire. Her paternal grandparents were the former Elizabeth Searle and Thomas Trevor, 1st Baron Trevor, a Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Lord President of the Council.
Personal life.
She married Charles Spencer, then Earl of Sunderland on 23 May 1732, becoming Countess of Sunderland. The Earl's grandmother, Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, disapproved of the marriage because Elizabeth's grandfather, the 1st Baron Trevor, had been a political opponent. The dowager commented that "she has very bad teeth, which I think is an objection alone in a wife, and they will be sure to grow worse with time." Elizabeth became a duchess in the following year when her husband inherited the dukedom. Together, they had five children:
She also acted as godmother to George John Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer in 1758.
The couple lived at a lodge in the "Little Park" at Windsor, by the permission of Sarah Churchill, but the dowager was unhappy with the alterations made by the new duke, and forced them to move out in 1737, replacing them with Charles's younger brother John and his new wife.
Legacy.
Her portrait, by Jean-Baptiste Van Loo, hangs in Blenheim Palace.

It created another three funds in the following years; its third fund raised $100 million, while its fourth fund raised $200 million.
In 2011, Timbercreek sold Timbercreek REIT, consisting of 5,112 apartment units, for $182 million, to a group of private equity investors led by Greystone Managed Investments.

Société du Djebel-Djérissa

The Société du Djebel-Djérissa (SDD) is a Tunisian iron ore mining company founded in 1899 that began operations in 1907. 
It produced up to 700,000 tons per year of hematite ore in the years before World War II.

The Jebel Djérissa is a partial dome of limestone about south of El Kef.
It is faulted and collapsed around the perimeter, and contains important deposits of brown hematite.
At first Hematite was mined at Jérissa with iron content of 54%, and from 1974 Siderite with a content of 40% was also recovered.
Typically the Siderite is found below the Hematite, under the paleohydrostatic level.
The railway from Tunis to Kalaa-Djerda was opened in 1906 and carried ore from the Djerissa and Slata mines.
The gauge railway from the Djérissa mine to the port of La Goulette (Tunis) is long.
The company also owns mining rights at Tamera.
The Tamera-Douahria group is an important iron region in northern Tunisia about west of Tunis.
It is estimated to have exploitable iron ore reserves of about 9 million tons.
The most common minerals are Goethite, Hematite and Limonite.
History.
La Compagnie des mines du Djebel-Djerissa was created in 1899 with a capital of 4.5 million francs divided into 9,000 shares of 500 francs.
In 1905 the nominal share value was reduced to 400 francs and the capital was reduced to 3.6 million francs.
The Société du Djebel-Djerissa became in effect a subsidiary of the Société Mokta El Hadid of Algeria, which took a stake of 5,200 shares in the mine in 1906.
In 1920 the 9,000 shares of 400 francs were divided into 36,000 shares of 100 francs.
On 13 June 1907 Philippe de Cerner, director of Mokta-el-Hadid, arrived at the mine, where 1,000 workers of all types were engaged in "feverish activity".
They had already extracted 30,000 tons of ore, the post &amp; telegraphs office had been opened since 1 May 1907, and the engineers expected the railway works to be completed for a first shipment in January 1908.
The first train carrying ore from the mine to the newly built quays at La Goulette arrived in March 1908.
115,239 tons were extracted in the first year, and this was doubled in 1909.
In 1910 256,388 tons were embarked at La Goulette in 71 ships with an average capacity of 3,600 tons.
The mountain was steadily removed from the top, and already by 1911 was a plateau rather than a peak.
As of 1911 the Djerissa mine was shipping almost 1,000 tons of ore a day.
Ore was carried down by gravity-driven wagons to large hoppers standing over the railway, from which it was poured into empty railway wagons.
Ore was shipped to La Goulette in wagons holding 30 tons of ore.
The wagons had hinged side walls that could be opened at the port so the ore would pour out.
These were poured into skips mounted on trolleys, which then dumped the ore into galleries with a total storage capacity of about 80,000 tons.
The ore was loaded into ships via a conveyor belt fed ore from a hopper, with the hopper either loaded directly from the 30 ton wagons or from the storage galleries.
About 80 people were employed at the docks, loading 70,000 tons per month.
During World War I (1914–18), the mine shipped 353,945 tons of ore in 1916, much of it used by English forges making war munitions.
In the years before World War II (1939–1945) production averaged 600,000 to 700,000 tons per year.
Production reached 718,000 tonnes in 1937.
647,551 tons were extracted in 1938.
During the early part of the war the storage and embarkation facilities at La Goulette suffered serious damage and wrecks near the wharf made it inaccessible to large vessels. 
Production increased later in the war and after the war as the facilities were repaired.
Output in tons was 29,703 (1943), 88,863 (1944), 152,450 (1945), 183,705 (1946) and 403,691 (1947).
Estimated exports in 1948 were:
As of 1949 the company was among the 20 largest in France, with capitalization of 5.7 billion francs.
Henri Lafond was chairman and chief executive officer of the Société du Djebel-Djérissa from 1945 to 1962, and director of various other companies.
Jacques Lucius was chairman of the Société du Djebel Djérissa from 1955 to 1966.
He was a director from 1956 to 1975.
He was also director of the Compagnie des phosphates et du chemin de fer de Gafsa from 1956 to 1968, and negotiated the entry of the Tunisian government into both companies.
The village of Jerissa was built from scratch in a barren valley dominated by the brown silhouette of the Jebel Djérissa, the iron mountain.
In 1911 it had a church, dispensary and playing field.
It developed into a French town with a church and cemetery, red tiles, play circles, three tennis courts and a bowling alley.
The Djerissa football club was in the national division in 1969–70.
The town thrived until the 1970s with a population of more than 3,000 workers from around Tunisia, as well as Maltese, Italians, Spaniards, Algerians, Moroccans and, Senegalese.
Starting in 1960 extraction began by quarry and underground shafts.
The company became publicly owned on 31 December 1961, and was still a state company as of 2018.
As of 2009 the mining town was run down and the workforce had been reduced to 300.
In September 2012 it was reported that the company had extracted 200,000 tonnes in the past year, of which 20,000 tonnes were for export.
The Hamima mine was expected to be opened soon.

2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit

The 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit, commonly known as the Singapore Summit, was a summit meeting between North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump, held at the Capella Hotel, Sentosa, Singapore, on June 12, 2018. It was the first-ever meeting between leaders of North Korea and the United States. They signed a joint statement, agreeing to security guarantees for North Korea, new peaceful relations, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, recovery of soldiers' remains, and follow-up negotiations between high-level officials. Both leaders also met separately with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Immediately following the summit, President Trump announced that the U.S. military would discontinue "provocative" joint military exercises with South Korea, and stated that he wished to bring the U.S. soldiers back home at some point, but he reinforced that it was not part of the Singapore equation. On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Senate passed the military budget bill for 2019, forbidding funding the reduction of active USFK personnel below 22,000; significant removal of US forces is considered a non-negotiable item in denuclearization talks with the North.
After a period of heightened conflict that included North Korea successfully testing what it claims was its first hydrogen bomb and the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in late 2017, tensions began to de-escalate after Kim Jong-un announced his desire to send athletes to the 2018 Winter Olympics being held in South Korea. During the games, Kim proposed talks with South Korea to plan an inter-Korean summit. On March 8, the South Korean delegation returned from the talks and traveled to the United States to deliver an invitation by Kim Jong-un to Donald Trump for a meeting. High-level exchanges between the two sides then took place, including a visit by then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang and a visit by Kim Yong-chol, Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, to the White House. Both sides threatened to cancel the summit after a round of joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea, with Trump even delivering a formal letter to Kim to call off the meeting; however, the two sides eventually agreed to meet.
A second meeting was held between Trump and Kim in February 2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Background.
Korea has been divided since 1945. The Korean War of 1950–1953 ended with an armistice agreement but not a peace settlement. A sporadic conflict has continued, with American troops remaining in the South as part of a mutual defense treaty. The North began building a nuclear reactor in 1963, and it began a nuclear weapons program in the 1980s. North Korea first committed to denuclearization in 1992 in the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In a speech authored by David Frum, President George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" during his 2002 State of the Union address, but in the 2005 Joint Statement of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks, North Korea reaffirmed the 1992 Joint Declaration and the goal of verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In 2008, North Korea voluntarily gave information on its nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief, and they were taken off the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Despite this, nuclear inspectors were barred from surveying any North Korean weapons facilities. The Obama administration had a policy of "strategic patience", in which perceived North Korean provocations would not be "rewarded" with presidential attention or the sending of high-level envoys but instead be punished with sanctions and greater military coordination with South Korea and Japan. More nuclear tests were conducted in the succeeding years, and the 2010 bombardment of Yeonpyeong markedly raised tensions between North Korea and South Korea. The escalation of North Korea's nuclear program advanced particularly under the rule of Kim Jong-un, who became the leader in December 2011, after his father Kim Jong-il died.
Donald Trump was elected US president in 2016 with a position of opposition to Barack Obama's policy of "strategic patience" towards North Korea. While advocating a tough stance, he also expressed openness to dialogue, saying he would be prepared to "eat a hamburger" with Kim. He put himself at odds with military allies, saying that it would be better if South Korea and Japan protect themselves. In return, a pro-North Korean website, DPRK Today, described him as a "wise politician". The editorial suggested that Trump might make the slogan "Yankee go home" a reality. In 2017, Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy of friendly relations with the North.
During a period of heightened tensions with the United States, North Korea successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named Hwasong-14, in July 2017. In response to heightened North Korean rhetoric, Trump warned that any North Korean attack "will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before". In response, North Korea announced that it was considering a missile test in which the missiles would land near the US territory of Guam. North Korea tested what some sources argued may have been its first hydrogen bomb on September 3. The test was internationally condemned, and further economic sanctions were put on North Korea. The United States also added North Korea back to its State Sponsors of Terrorism list after nine years. On November 28, North Korea launched the Hwasong-15, which, according to analysts, would be capable of reaching anywhere in the United States. The United Nations responded by placing further sanctions on the country. After North Korea claimed that the missile was capable of "carrying [a] super-heavy [nuclear] warhead and hitting the whole mainland of the U.S.", Kim-Jong-Un announced that they had "finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force", putting them in a position of strength to push the United States into talks.
In his New Year address for 2018, North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un celebrated completing their nuclear capabilities and proposed talks for sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea. In January a false missile alert alarmed Hawaii. The Seoul–Pyongyang hotline was reopened after almost two years. North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation passed on an invitation to President Moon to visit North Korea. The United States was represented by Vice President Mike Pence. After arriving late to a dinner hosted by President Moon, he was asked to greet the other dignitaries, but he shook hands with everyone except Kim Yong-nam and left early. North and South Korean athletes marched together in the Olympics opening ceremony and fielded a united women's ice hockey team.
Announcement.
On March 5, 2018, South Korea's special delegation agreed to hold the third inter-Korean summit at Inter-Korean Peace House in Panmunjom on April 27, 2018. On March 6, after returning to South Korea, the national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, and National Information Director Suh Hoon traveled to the United States on March 8 to report to Trump about the upcoming inter-Korean summit and relayed to President Trump the North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un's invitation. Trump endorsed the North Korea–United States summit about an hour after receiving the report. The South Korean National Security Adviser (SKNS), Mr. Jeong briefed the public that the North Korea–United States summit would be held sometime in May 2018.
The White House announced that the UN Sanctions would remain in place until an agreement between the United States and North Korea is reached. On March 6, Sarah Sanders said that the White House would need to see "concrete and verifiable steps" toward the denuclearization of North Korea before Trump would meet with Kim Jong-un. Later that day, an unidentified Trump official told "The Wall Street Journal" that Trump had still accepted Kim Jong-un's invitation.
South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-yong visited China on March 12 to meet with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, of the foreign officials and report on the planned inter-Korean summit as well as the North Korea-United States summit and asked their advice. Russia on March 14, 2018, for explaining North Korea and the United States Visit Summary, seeking guidance for upcoming 2018 inter-Korean summit. National Information Director Suh Hoon visited Japan and had a consultation with Prime Minister Shinzō Abe including the foreign officials about the denuclearization and Permanent Peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Preparations.
Preparatory talks.
South Korea's foreign ministry announced on March 18 that selected informal delegations from North Korea, South Korea, and the US would meet for denuclearization discussions in April in Vantaa, Finland. (This type of discussions, as held previously, had sometimes been referred to as track-2 talks.) According to South Korea's "Yonhap" news, Choe Kang-il, a deputy director general for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry, would also attend the event, which "Yonhap" termed "track-1.5 talks".
Kim Jong-un's meeting with Xi Jinping.
North Korea's supreme leader Kim was in Beijing on March 25–28, 2018, arriving by special train for talks with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, Kim's first known out-of-country excursion since taking power six years previously. China stated that North Korea was "committed to denuclearization" and willing to hold a summit with the United States. It was organized by the invitation of Xi. During the meeting between two leaders, Kim officially invited Xi to the North Korean capital Pyongyang when it was convenient in his schedule, and Xi accepted the invitation.
Xi urged Kim to strengthen the strategic and diplomatic future partnership between China and North Korea. Kim stressed to Xi that North Korea and China are communist countries and that there are many ways to cooperate in various aspects in the future. Kim and Xi met again on May 7, 2018, in the city of Dalian, China.
Announcement within North Korea.
According to North Korea's state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Kim led a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's political bureau on April 9, 2018, where he spoke about the planned summit with Trump for the first time.
Proposed conditions by North Korea.
On April 11, North Korea presented five entreaties as conditions for the dismissal of their nuclear-capable ICBMs:
Although North Korea was previously expected to request the withdrawal of United States Forces Korea (USFK) from South Korea, North Korea publicized they would embrace the continuous deployment of 25,000 USFK troops in South Korea as long as the security of North Korea is guaranteed.
April 2018 inter-Korean summit.
At an inter-Korean summit on April 27, 2018, held at the Peace House in Panmunjom, the leaders of North and South Korea agreed to formally end the Korean War before the end of the year and confirmed the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through denuclearization.
Release of the American detainees.
On May 10, 2018, three Americans held by North Korea were released following negotiations between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime. Some have speculated that their release was part of an attempt of the regime to motivate the US to continue the negotiations and perhaps ease the pressure upon the North Koreans. Nevertheless, their release has managed to ease the tensions between the Trump administration and the North Korean regime, enabling both sides to proceed to further negotiations, possibly leading to the 2018 North Korea–United States summit.
The three Americans Kim Dong-chul, Kim Sang-duk, and Kim Hak-song left North Korea accompanied by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and were greeted by the president and the first lady upon their landing on US soil at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
Tensions, cancelation, and reinstatement.
American Vice President Mike Pence said on May 21, 2018, that "this will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong-un doesn't make a deal" to "dismantle his nuclear weapons program". Trump had made similar remarks on May 17, as he described that Libya's fate is "what will take place if we don't make a deal". These comments were in reference to the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi after military intervention by Americans and Europeans in 2011. After a NATO airstrike prevented Gaddafi's escape, the Libyan rebels captured, assaulted, sodomized, and executed Gaddafi. However, Libya under Gaddafi had already in 2003 voluntarily ended its nuclear weapons program and complied with conditions set by Western powers. As a result, North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence's remarks "ignorant and stupid" and threatened a "nuclear-to-nuclear showdown".
Trump canceled the summit on May 24, 2018, via a letter to Chairman Kim, writing that "based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting ... You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used." Even though it was Trump who decided to cancel, Trump told Kim, "If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write."
South Korean President Moon was left "very perplexed" by Trump's cancellation, while the South Korean minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs Cho Myoung-gyon said that North Korea "remains sincere" on "efforts on denuclearization and peace building".
In response to Trump's cancellation, North Korean vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan expressed his country's "willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format", being "open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US" for the "peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula". Trump's cancellation had come on the day North Korea had detonated explosives at its only known nuclear test site, at Punggye-ri in front of international journalists; North Korea claimed that this would have demolished the test site.
On May 25, however, Trump announced that the summit could resume as scheduled following a "very nice statement" he received from North Korea and that talks were now resuming.
The following day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed in a statement that a "pre-advance team for Singapore will leave as scheduled in order to prepare the summit should take place". The team, consisting of about thirty staffers from both the White House and State Department, met with North Korean counterparts over Memorial Day weekend.
On May 30, North Korean general Kim Yong-chol arrived in New York City to meet with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Negotiations between Kim and Pompeo continued the next day, and Pompeo later stated at a press conference that "good progress" had been made. Kim Yong-chol, who is the Vice Chair of Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the US since 2000 (when Jo Myong-rok met with US President Bill Clinton in Washington, D.C.).
On June 1, Trump announced the summit would resume as scheduled for June 12 after he met Kim Yong-chol at the White House. Kim Yong-chol delivered a letter from Kim Jong-un to Trump, of which Trump first told reporters that it was "a very nice" and "a very interesting letter", yet eight minutes later said "I haven't seen the letter yet. I purposely didn't open the letter".
US–South Korea summit.
On May 22, 2018, South Korea President Moon Jae-in visited the United States to meet President Trump, to promote Trump-Kim summit progress, and to coordinate the two countries' common strategy regarding the upcoming summit, following harsh rhetoric from North Korea towards Washington.
Closure of Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site.
On 12 May 2018, North Korea announced the closure and planned dismantlement of its Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, and invited journalists to witness the destruction of its tunnels and other testing infrastructure. On 24 May 2018, reporters witnessed explosions to purportedly close those tunnels, although independent inspectors were not present. Those explosions destroyed the portals to several test tunnels, but the extent of the damage to the tunnels themselves was not clear.
Replacement of North Korean generals.
On June 3, North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-un replaced three general officers responsible for the development of North Korea's ICBM nuclear weapons.
May 2018 inter-Korean summit.
Two leaders of North and South Koreas exchanged their opinions about the issues and solutions for the Trump-Kim summit as Trump abruptly cancelled the upcoming US-North Korea summit on 12 June. The principal agenda of the meeting was trying to get U.S. summit back on track and keep progressing the denuclearization talks. 
The second 2018 summit was established by Kim Jung-un's suggestion within a whirlwind 24 hour notice, but Moon Jae-in accepted Kim's invitation as per the critical nuclear agenda between North and South Korea. Moon Jae-in had expressed his belief, and he discussed with Kim Jong Un about Kim's willingness to join nuclear interventions with Trump. Both leaders also agreed to accelerate the implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration and meet again at "anytime and anyplace" without formality.
Potential denuclearization process.
During President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korea envoy, the former spy chief Kim Yong-chol at the White House, Trump said that he would choose the "denuclearization process" in North Korea. The nuclear warheads and the ICBM nuclear missiles completed in North Korea could be transferred outside of North Korea and economic sanctions on North Korea could be partly alleviated. The next step would be comprehensive inspections on North Korea's nuclear facilities and nuclear ICBM weapons program by IAEA.
On July 7, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha met in Tokyo, where they reaffirmed their unity in urging North Korea to denuclearize as promised. The ministers stressed the need to call on North Korea to take concrete steps toward denuclearization and to keep existing U.N. economic sanctions in place. 
Ten days later, Donald Trump said there is "no time limit" for North Korea to denuclearize and that there is no need to rush the process.
Logistical preparations.
On June 3, a "special event area" was declared by the Ministry of Home Affairs around the area surrounding the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore and stringent security measures will be in force from June 10–14. On the same day, a smaller segment within the "special event area" was declared a "special zone" by the Singapore Police Force where enhanced police powers will be in effect during the same period. On June 5, the Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore) declared the whole of Sentosa Island, including waters off its south-west beaches, a "special event area" from June 10–14. The summit venue Capella Singapore sits on the "special event area". The government also issued an order exempting four bulletproof and bombproof vehicles from certain traffic rules for the purposes of conveying "non-citizen" individuals for the summit from June 5–30.
The F1 Pit Building has also been designated as the summit's International Media Centre for international journalists to cover the summit and will be operated from 10 am on June 10 to 10 pm on June 13.
On June 6, Singapore's aviation authorities announced that temporary airspace restrictions will be put in place for parts of June 11, 12 and 13. Aircraft arriving at Singapore Changi Airport will be required to reduce speed and some restrictions are placed on runway use. Aviators are also informed to stay away from Paya Lebar Air Base, a facility used by US Presidents on their previous visits to Singapore.
The Singapore Mint also released three commemorative medallions to mark the summit. They are available in gold proof, silver proof, and nickel plated zinc proof.
On June 9, the Singapore Police Force and the Land Transport Authority announced that security measures, such as road closures and security checks, will kick in. Some bus stops in the Tanglin area will be skipped and security checks will be conducted along stretches of roads around the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore and the St Regis Hotel Singapore, the two hotels Trump and Kim are believed to be staying in. Bag searches and other security checks may be conducted for visitors entering Sentosa Island.
On June 11, Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan announced that the Singapore government would be paying for the North Korean contingent's hotel bill, forming part of the total US$20 million expenditure for the summit, as it was "hospitality that we would have offered them". On June 25, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced that the summit cost S$16.3 million, lower than the initial planned cost mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Diplomatic preparations.
In preparation for the summit, Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan visited the United States on a working visit and met with the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John R. Bolton. He visited North Korea and met with North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam to further lay the groundwork for the Trump-Kim summit.
The United States did not convene a Cabinet-level National Security Council meeting to discuss the summit with North Korea. Trump said: "I think I'm very well prepared ... I don't think I have to prepare very much ... this isn't a question of preparation, it's a question of whether or not people want it to happen, and we'll know that very quickly."
Media center.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong visited the summit's International Media Centre on June 10 when it opened. At a media conference, Lee mentioned that the summit cost S$20 million, with security costs taking up S$10 million and the setting up of the International Media Centre costing S$5 million, but it is a cost that Singapore is "willing to pay". The media center opened to journalists and they were given customized items, including a bottle of water, a fan, and a notebook. The center hosted more than 2500 local and international journalists.
Meeting location.
Background.
On March 31 and possibly also April 1, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo had secretly met with Kim in Pyongyang to lay the groundwork for the summit, including their discussing possible venues. On April 17, on the day of a meeting at Mar-a-Lago of Trump with Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe, sources revealed to reporters the identities involved in the discussions in Pyongyang.
Locations considered.
Trump administration sources said on April 28 that the meeting would be held in either Singapore or Mongolia. On April 30, Trump remarked on a possibility the Peace House and inter-Korean House of Freedom (Joint Security Area) in Panmunjom would serve as venues. Trump believed that Panmunjom in DMZ would be the reasonable location for the meeting to remove nuclear weapons and to sign the preparatory peace treaty on the Korean peninsula.
The inter-Korean Peace House was where the 2018 inter-Korean summit was held earlier in April. Singapore was the site of a recent China–Taiwan summit. Mongolia has sponsored a number of talks in recent years involving regional and international players and is accessible by train from North Korea.
On April 30, Trump confirmed that Singapore, the Peace House and the inter-Korean House of Freedom were under consideration.
American officials said the most likely mutually-agreed-upon choice of venue would be in Southeast Asia or Europe, especially from among the choices of Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Switzerland (where Kim and his two siblings had some schooling), or Sweden (whose embassy acts as intermediary for Americans traveling in North Korea). Another possible location of the summit would be Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
Additionally proposed venues included Pyongyang, North Korea (favored by Kim); the Inter-Korean Peace House in Panmunjom near the boundary of the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea (site for the April 27, 2018 inter-Korean summit; a site possibly favored by Kim for the summit with the US as well); the Russian port city of Vladivostok (accessible to Kim by land or sea and nearby Vyatskoye, Kim's predecessor and father Kim Jong-il's February 16, 1941 birthplace); a Chinese city such as Shenyang, Changchun, or Beijing (favored by China); Seoul or South Korea's Jeju Island; or, aboard a US ship in international waters.
Announcement on holding the talks in Singapore.
CNN reported on May 9 that Singapore will be hosting the meeting on June 12. As per CNBC, a White House official said Singapore was chosen as it has diplomatic relations with both United States and North Korea, and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries. Trump confirmed the location on May 10 and announced that the summit is set for June 12. At from Pyongyang's Sunan airport, Singapore is easily within the range of Kim's Soviet-made Il-62M aircraft. Local media reported that the most likely choice of venue would be the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore near Orchard Road, known for hosting the annual Shangri-La Dialogue and the 2015 Ma–Xi meeting. A South Korean report also cited The Istana, the official residence of the President of Singapore, as a possible venue to host the summit.
Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs further provided information on the summit stating that "Singapore is pleased to host the meeting between President of the United States Donald J. Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong-un on 12 June 2018. We hope this meeting will advance prospects for peace in the Korean Peninsula". However, the ministry did not provide any details on the venue and the arrangements.
Following Trump's renewed commitment to the summit on June 1, Singapore's Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen welcomed the move and stated that Singapore would cover some of the costs of the summit. Advance team members of the American and North Korean delegations that were meeting in Singapore in prior weeks were believed to have been staying in Capella Singapore on Sentosa, and the Fullerton Hotel Singapore in the city's Downtown Core respectively, both of which were additional venue options for the summit.
The White House announced on June 4 that the meeting will take place at 9:00 am (SGT), and confirmed the next day that Capella Singapore will be the venue for the June 12 summit. The US clarified that they would not pay for North Korea's officials' accommodation. They also affirmed that they would talk with the South Korean and Japanese governments if asked about the possible declaration of the end of the Korean War during the summit.
On June 9, 2018, at a press conference at the G7 Summit in Quebec, Trump estimated that the interpersonal chemistry between him and Leader Kim Jong-un would be a deciding factor in the success of the Summit in Singapore and that this would be a one-time chance for North Korea to strike a deal.
Pre-summit events.
Leaders' arrivals.
US President Donald Trump left the 44th G7 summit around four hours earlier than scheduled and departed directly for Singapore. He reportedly viewed the G7 summit as a "distraction" from his summit with Kim. Trump landed at Singapore's Paya Lebar Airbase at 20:20 local time and was welcomed by Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan. A US Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport plane was already at the air base ahead of his arrival. Trump stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore, which has also hosted previous US Presidents.
North Korean chairman Kim Jong-un landed at Singapore Changi Airport on Sunday at about 14:35 local time and was welcomed by Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung. Kim flew to Singapore on a Boeing 747 operated by Air China, a plane used by the highest echelons of the Chinese leadership. According to media reports, a cargo plane, an Air Koryo Ilyushin Il-76, containing food items and other perishables landed in Singapore from North Korea before Kim's plane landed. Chiller trucks ferried them to the St. Regis Hotel Singapore where Kim stayed. A third plane from North Korea, an Air Koryo Ilyushin Il-62, landed shortly afterward; Kim's sister and Vice Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, Kim Yo-jong, was believed to be on board.
Working-level meetings.
Both Trump and Kim met separately with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Kim met Lee on Sunday evening at The Istana. Trump met Lee on Monday afternoon, also at The Istana. He was accorded a bilateral meeting, followed by a working lunch and then an expanded bilateral meeting. During the meeting, Trump accepted President Halimah Yacob's invitation to make a State Visit to Singapore in November 2018, in conjunction with the 6th ASEAN-US Summit and 13th East Asia Summit.
A working-level meeting was held between the United States Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son-hui, at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore on Monday morning. The meeting lasted over two hours and was believed to further work out the details of the summit between Trump and Kim and to push forward their agendas.
Meanwhile, North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho met with his Singaporean counterpart Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday morning too.
Pre-summit activities.
Trump's activities.
After meeting Singapore's Prime Minister, Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo met and thanked the team at the United States embassy in Singapore and Task Force 73 at Shangri-La Hotel.
Trump then discussed the summit with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in in a 40-minute phone call, expressing that he is willing to take "bold decisions" while Moon said that South Koreans are praying for Trump to "create a miraculous result". He also spoke with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on the phone.
US press briefing.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a press briefing at the White House press room set up at the JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach Hotel on Monday afternoon. He mentioned details of the preparations done by the US delegation and that the US is willing to offer North Korea security guarantees in exchange for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
South Korea press briefing.
A South Korean official spoke at a closed-door press briefing held at South Korea's Korea Press Center, confirming that Moon Jae-in will not travel to Singapore to attend the summit, despite earlier speculations. Instead, South Korea sent a delegation to Singapore to monitor the summit.
Kim's tour of Singapore.
Kim visited several of Singapore's attractions in the Central Area together with his sister, Kim Yo-jong, on Monday evening. They visited the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, the Jubilee Bridge, and the Marina Bay Sands integrated resorts. They were accompanied by Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung, the same ministers who welcomed him at Changi Airport the previous day.
Dennis Rodman.
Retired U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, who made a number of visits to North Korea to promote sports and developed a personal relationship with Chairman Kim over several years, announced that he would be in Singapore during the summit but would not be involved in the meeting. Rodman arrived the day before the summit. The basketball star broke down in tears live on CNN as he recounted the hostility he faced for meeting Kim Jong-un.
Summit meeting.
The summit was broadcast in real-time internationally.
One-on-one meeting.
United States President Donald Trump arrived at Capella Hotel first before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived seventeen minutes later. They started the summit at 9:05 am local time with a 12-second handshake and then participated in a one-on-one meeting, with interpreters only. Trump and Kim emerged from the one-on-one talks and walked down the corridor to the Cassia where the expanded bilateral meeting took place. Trump described the one-on-one meeting as "very very good" when asked by a reporter. When Trump was asked if he had notes of the one-on-one meeting to refer back and verify, Trump replied, "I don't have to verify because I have one of the great memories of all time".
Expanded bilateral meeting and working lunch.
Both countries' delegations proceeded to participate in an expanded bilateral meeting and a working lunch.
Both delegations dined together on Korean, Southeast Asian and Western dishes with ice cream, tropézienne, and dark chocolate ganache tartlet for dessert. After the lunch, Trump and Kim took a short walk together and viewed the interior of the presidential state car.
Joint signing ceremony.
Subsequently, Trump and Kim signed a joint statement, titled "Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit", which Trump described as a "very important" and "comprehensive" agreement.
The document said:
In addition to the numbered provisions, the joint statement also mentions Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees to North Korea. Follow-up negotiations between Pompeo and an undetermined high-level North Korean official are also called for by the joint statement.
US news conference.
Trump held a news conference at 16:15 local time which lasted for more than an hour. In his news conference, Trump said that further discussions will take place with North Korean officials and that he would consider visiting Pyongyang. Referring to his commitment in the Joint Statement to "provide security guarantees" to North Korea, Trump announced the end of the joint military exercises with the South Korean military, which he described as "provocative". U.S. Forces Korea and South Korea were apparently not consulted. He expressed his hope that the removal of 32,000 American troops defending South Korea would become part of the equation. The next round of joint military exercises was scheduled for late August.
End of summit.
On June 12, Trump left Singapore from Paya Lebar Air Base at around 18:30 local time, earlier than his planned departure time of 19:00 while Kim Jong-un left Singapore from Changi Airport at around 22:30.
Upon returning to the United States the following day, President Trump declared that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat. On June 22, 2018, Trump provided a "Notice Regarding the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to North Korea," which extended the Executive Order 13466 of 2008 by one year, reaffirming "the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."
In October 2018, a second North Korea–United States summit was announced.
Reactions.
The summit received a mixed international reaction, with many countries expressing praise or hope for achieving a peace deal from the summit. Some commentators expressed skepticism towards the signed agreement, pointing to a history of failed past agreements and to the vague wording of the declarations. China raised the possibility of sanction relief following the summit, but Pompeo said sanction relief would only be granted after complete denuclearization. Joint-military exercises between the United States and South Korea were halted, a demand that North Korea had long made. Visitors to North Korea reported that anti-American posters, postcards, stamps and similar items were no longer sold in tourist shops.
Incidents.
On June 9, two South Korean media personnel from South Korean broadcaster KBS News were arrested for trespassing at the home of the North Korean ambassador in Singapore. KBS News subsequently issued an apology for not being cautious. The two media personnel were deported the next day on June 10.
On June 11, five South Korean women were arrested on Monday night for protesting outside the St. Regis Hotel where Chairman Kim and his delegation were staying. The police warned the women for violating the Public Order Act but they refused to cooperate, leading to their arrests.
Aftermath.
Progress of joint statement.
The director of USC Korean Studies Institute David C. Kang wrote an analysis of North Korea's solution which was published in "The New York Times". Writing that the Trump administration should proceed with the necessary action items of U.S. side in order to ask North Korea to give up their Nuclear Weapons, Kang emphasized that unilateral disarmament of the DPRK would be impractical, and that a "phased" and "synchronous" approach with "step by step" negotiations would be a more reasonable way forward, with respect to the US-DPRK Joint Statement signed at the Singapore summit. The DPRK has shown eight or more types of various actions on their portion of the agreement; a moratorium on missile/nuclear tests, dismantling the Sohae atomic test and satellite launch site, the shutting down of an intercontinental ballistic missile assembly facility near Pyongyang, the returning of the remains of 55 U.S. Soldiers killed in the Korean War, the removal of domestic anti-American propaganda, and the release of three American Citizens arrested and imprisoned in the DPRK, as North Korean action items of the summit. However, the US has thus far taken only one action; the cancelling of joint military exercises between the US and South Korean Air Forces in the peninsula. 
If the United States should complete more of its action items under the Singapore agreement, with regard to North Korea's security concerns, the North Korean government in turn may be willing to make further actions toward denuclearization.
North Korean minister Ri Yong-ho has claimed that the US is backtracking or has made no progress on the American side of the Singapore Summit agreement, while saying that North Korea itself has taken some measures including the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, along with the removal of a primary nuclear site.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made a request for North Korea to hand over 60 to 70 percent of its nuclear arsenal within six to eight months. However, the DPRK has not yet accepted that proposal. The North Korean foreign minister released an announcement criticizing unilateral denuclearization, and Ri Yong-ho has emphasized that it is only equitable to perform a “balanced, simultaneous, step-by-step implementation” of the US-DPRK Joint Statement.
There are four action items in the Joint Statement, the first and second items being the renewal of North Korea–United States relations, the third item being the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the final item the recovery of American POW/MIA remains from the Korean War. Currently, there are still three American nuclear capable jets stationed in South Korea. Additionally, North and South Korea, still lacking a proper peace treaty, are still technically at war. The DPRK urged the US to guarantee the DPRK's security by a formal declaration of the ending of the Korean War, in exchange for the DPRK ending its nuclear program and forfeiting its nuclear weapons. Doug Bandow, a special assistant to former President Ronald Reagan, suggested that the US provide the DPRK with a safety framework in the form of a peace treaty, in exchange for the DPRK ending their nuclear program.
Removed anti-American propaganda in DPRK.
The DPRK government toned down aspects of its anti-American propaganda after the Singapore summit, with many anti-American posters being removed in the capital to give way to less politicized messages. The government also cancelled North Korea's annual "anti-US imperialism" rally on 27 July, a national holiday commemorating the start of the Korean War (Fatherland Liberation War in DPRK historiography).
Pompeo's subsequent visits to North Korea.
On July 6–7, Pompeo travelled to North Korea for the third time to continue the negotiations with Kim Yong-chol, "a senior official who has been [North Korea's] point person in deliberations with the United States, South Korea and China". After the meeting, Pompeo said that the talks were productive and that progress had been made "on almost all of the central issues". However, North Korean state media criticized the meeting soon after, saying the U.S. had shown a "gangster-like attitude" and calling the demands of the Trump administration "deeply regrettable". Notwithstanding the stern reports, Pompeo delivered a letter from Kim to Trump, in which the latter expressed his hope for successful implementation of the US-North Korea Joint Statement and reaffirmed his will for improving the relations between the countries.
Pompeo announced on August 23, 2018, that he would return to North Korea the following week for the fourth round of talks. The following day, Trump tweeted that he had asked Pompeo not to make the trip because he felt "we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." Concerning the cancellation of Pompeo's planned North Korea trip, Vox summarized the background based on the reports by "The Washington Post" and CNN that
North Korea delivered an irate letter to Pompeo and the letter was shown to Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, and Trump tweeted the cancellation of Pompeo's trip. The message from DPRK was North Korea's evident disappointment as Washington had shown no real eagerness to sign a peace treaty to end the Korean War.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha spoke to Pompeo by telephone on August 25, urging the U.S. and DPRK to continue talks relating to denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, in spite of concerns over the cancellation of the trip by Trump. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono revealed appreciation for Pompeo's "prompt communication” with South Korea, and said Japan would be pleased to cooperate with the U.S. for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Return of remains of US soldiers.
On June 27, Pompeo said North Korea was planning to hand over presumed remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War in the near future.
Following Pompeo's second visit to Pyongyang, a lower ranks meeting took place on July 15 regarding the retrieving of remains of US soldiers from the Korean War. Pompeo called the talks "productive" and said the two sides had reached firm commitments on the issue. On July 27 North Korea handed over 55 boxes of human remains, thus starting to fulfill their pledge in the Singapore declaration. The remains were saluted in a ceremony in their honor by US soldiers. More than 36,000 American troops died during the Korean War, but some 7,700 remain unaccounted for, including 5,300 believed to have died in North Korea. Earlier, 220 remains were recovered during 1996–2005. North Korea reported to the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency that they couldn't be sure how many individuals were represented in each of the 55 boxes.
There was uncertainty about the nationality of the war remains, whether the individuals were American or from other countries that took part in the Korean War, such as Australia, Belgium, France, and the Philippines. Kelly McKeague, the director of the POW/MIA Accounting Agency, said a preliminary review showed that the remains are "consistent" with being American and are from the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. The next phase would be matching the dental records, X-rays and DNA testing to further analyze the remains for possible identification. McKeague expressed his opinion that North Korea needs to allow the resumption of joint U.S.-North Korean searches of battlefields and POW camp graveyards to discover more war remains as soon as practical.
Shutdown of ICBM assembly facility near Pyongyang.
The Voice of America (VOA) reported on July 25 that there is evidence that North Korea has dismantled an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) construction facility near Pyongyang. It was confirmed by analyzing satellite images taken around the March 16 with the latest satellite images in July. It was the investigated place of the factory that the Hwasong-15 ICBM that North Korea test-launched on November 29, 2017, was assembled at this plant and then moved on a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). Kim Jong-un was at this vehicle factory that was connected to the ICBM assembly factory when he gave the command for the transfer of the TEL carrying the Hwasong-15 ICBM. 
State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert announced that the U.S would be looking for DPRK's consent for allowing the Verification process of the denuclearization of North Korea. Heather also added “Verification is obviously something that is paramount. Verification from legitimate groups and done by legitimate countries."
Destruction of missile test site.
On July 24, it was reported that North Korea had begun to dismantle a rocket launching and testing site near Tonchang, an action which Kim had pledged to Trump. South Korean President Moon called the move "a good sign for North Korea’s denuclearization". The North Korea monitoring specialist group 38 North found that the Sohae Station, a satellite-launch site in North Korea, was being demolished. Satellite imagery shows that several significant structures were destroyed: a missile-launching stand and a building near a launchpad for satellites. 38 North suggested that it is an essential beginning step towards achieving a commitment made by Kim Jong Un at the June 12 Singapore Summit. On 7 August, there is more progress on Dismantling Facilities at the Sohae Satellite and Missile Launching Station. it entails the demolition of the test stand's concrete foundations, launch pad's gantry tower and pad foundation, etc.
While the previous dismantlement of the vertical engine test stand on 23 July, represents a fulfilment of Chairman Kim's arrangement with President Trump conducted publicly during the post-Singapore Summit press conference, activity at the launch pad and concrete foundation appears to go exceeding that pledge. These activities, however, must be viewed cautiously as “principal steps” since neither are presently permanent or irreversible.
Concerning 38 North's scrutiny, it would characterize more durable and irreversible actions as there is no identified facility with equivalent capabilities elsewhere in the DPRK.
North Korea announced in December 2019 that it had recently conducted a "very important test" at the Sohae site. Some analysts believed the test involved a new ICBM engine, as the country was believed to be migrating from its liquid-fueled missiles to new solid-fueled versions that were easier to transport, conceal and launch. The country announced it had conducted a "crucial test' at the Sohae site days later.
Negotiation process between US and DPRK.
In August, during the ASEAN Regional Forum 2018, North Korea's nuclear program was the critical agenda item. ASEAN forum foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling for a "complete denuclearization" which is the same phrase used in the joint statement issued after the summit, and represents a change from last year's call for a "complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization". South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has said that she had "considerable" consultations over the issue of the declaration to a formal end of the 1950-53 Korean war with the Chinese and U.S. foreign ministers. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said "everyone can announce a declaration ending the war if they do not want the war to happen again". North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said he was “alarmed” by U.S. insistence on maintaining sanctions until North Korea denuclearizes and what he said was U.S. reluctance to declare a formal end to the Korean War. United States Forces in Korea maintains several nuclear bomber fighters and DPRK is demanding USA safety guarantee for giving up nuclear weapon programs of Pyongyang.
Questions about missile development.
The media source 38 North, an American agency which monitors North Korea, told CNN that only two small roof buildings had been newly erected, which might be used for hospitality roles for senior officials or nuclear inspectors. Other improved infrastructures were already developed before the Trump-Kim Summit. On June 30, NBC reported that, according to an assessment by the U.S. intelligence agencies, North Korea might have increased production of fuel for nuclear weapons at multiple secret sites after the summit, though if the process of enrichment had occurred, it must have begun before the summit. On August 3, experts monitoring U.N. sanctions against North Korea sent a report to the UN Security Council saying North Korea "has not stopped its nuclear and missiles programs" and is still violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions. However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri-Yong Ho said in a privilege speech at the ASEAN summit, that a “good-faith implementation of the Joint Statement (between the USA and DPRK) would be necessary”. Referring to this same speech, the North Korea monitoring specialist Group, 38 North, believes that in order to achieve the goal to denuclearize, a scheme of ALL TAKE-NO GIVE will never work with DPRK.
"The New York Times" reported on November 12, 2018 that "satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception" by offering to dismantle one missile launch site while continuing to develop sixteen others. "The Times" reported that American intelligence had determined that North Korea's production of fissile material, nuclear weapons and mobile missile systems had continued since the summit, adding that the missile network was "long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North’s nuclear threat." The following day, Trump called the report of North Korea developing missile sites "inaccurate" and "just more fake news," adding "We fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new." "The Times" stood by the accuracy of its report. On November 13, 2018, Kim Eui Keum, a spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-In, described the report and images as "nothing new" and further stated that North Korea "has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory."
CNN acquired satellite images in December 2018 that indicated North Korea was continuing to significantly expand a major long-range missile site in the mountainous interior of the country, including an "extremely large underground facility" that could be under construction as of August 2018.
Second U.S.–North Korean Summit.
On October 7, 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim met in Pyongyang and agreed to a second U.S.–North Korea summit, with South Korea's presidential office stating that it would take place "as soon as possible." It is unknown at this time when the second summit will take place. However, Pompeo stated it would happen "soon" and that details have been revealed to South Korean President Moon Jae-In during a meeting in the South Korean capital of Seoul. During the State of the Union Address President Trump announced Vietnam to host the second meeting between the two leaders. According to President Trump, this summit will be held in Vietnam on February 27–28, 2019.
On February 8, 2019, President Trump announced that Hanoi will host the summit meeting.

Singularis Holdings Limited (in liquidation) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited

 is a judicial decision of Supreme Court of the United Kingdom relating to the duties owed by a bank where a person acting on behalf of a corporate customer of the bank directs the bank to transfer money out of the company's account as part of a fraudulent scheme.
The principle issues in the case were whether the bank had breached its duty to its customer by transferring the monies despite the suspicious circumstances surrounding the transfer request, and if so, whether the claim of the customer against the bank was precluded by the fact that the fraudulent acts of the director should be attributed to the customer so as to bar the claim of the customer against the bank. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, which had held that on the facts that the bank had breached the duty to their customer, and the fact that the fraud was perpetrated by a director of the corporate customer did not preclude the claim by that corporate customer against the bank.
"Practical Law" reported that this is the first decision where a bank in the United Kingdom had ever been held to be liable for breaching their duty to scrutinise customer transactions for possible fraud.
Facts.
Singularis Holdings Limited was a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands which was a personal asset holding company for Mr Maan Al Sanea. Mr Al Sanea was both a director and shareholder of Singularis. Singularis held a bank account with Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited which had very substantial sums of money on it.
Between 12 June and 27 July 2009 Mr Al Sanea gave eight separate instructions to Daiwa to make payments totalling approximately US$204 million out of Singularis's account. It was accepted by all parties that these payments instructions were fraudulent. At the time of the payments Singularis was verge of insolvency, and the payments were all made to other companies (referred in the judgment as the "Saad Group") which were owned and controlled by Mr Al Sanea.
Daiwa had raised concerns about the financial state of Singularis's financial position, as well as the freezing of Mr Al-Sanea's personal assets. Shortly before the relevant payment instructions, Daiwa's head of compliance sent an internal e-mail to colleagues:
That warning was not heeded, and the eight fraudulent payment instructions were paid out either without demanding any explanation at all, or on the basis of explanations that ostensibly appeared to be false. The Court of Appeal indicated that "There were failures at every level within Daiwa", and the trial judge found that Daiwa had a "dysfunctional structure leading to a sequence of events where everyone [assumed] that someone else [was] dealing with investigating the disputed payments but no one [troubled] to check whether that [was correct]".
The trial initially came before Rose J, handed down a lengthy judgment, in which she held that the bank had breached its duty to the customer, holding that "Any reasonable banker would have realised that there were many obvious signs that Mr Al Sanea was perpetrating a fraud on the company." However she reduced the claim by 25% to reflect the contributory negligence of the customer in allowing Mr Al Sanea to act without restraint. She further held that the fraud of Mr Al Sanea was not to be attributed to the company so as to bar any right of action on the basis of illegality.
Judgment.
Daiwa did not appeal against the finding of the trial judge that they had breached their duty of care as a bank to take reasonable care (the so-called "Quincecare" duty, after the decision of Steyn J in "Barclays Bank plc v Quincecare Ltd" [1992] 4 All ER 363). Instead they appealed against the decision of Rose J on five separate grounds:
Court of Appeal.
Sir Geoffrey Vos gave the judgment of the Court of Appeal. After reviewing the facts and the relevant authorities, Sir Geoffrey expressed the view that there essentially six core issues.
The first issue was whether the fraud of Mr Al Sanea should be attributed to Singularis. Counsel for Daiwa strongly urged that as Singularis was a "one man company" the fraud of Mr Al Sanea should be the fraud of the company. The Court of Appeal held that Rose J had correctly applied the test set out by the Supreme Court in , and that Singularis should not have that knowledge attributed to it. He cited with approval the comments of Lord Sumption in "Jetivia":
He further went on to elaborate that he did not find the phrase "one-man company" to be a helpful one. He noted in this case that Mr Al Sanea was not the sole director, although the other directors of Singularis were described as "supine".
The second issue was whether, if Daiwa succeeded on the first issue, the illegality defence would bar the claim of Singularis. The key authority in relation to illegality as a defence was now . As Daiwa had not succeeded on the first issue, Sir Geoffrey declined to spend a great deal of time considering the second issue, but he added only that if he had been called upon to determine the point, he was satisfied that Rose J had correctly applied the test at first instance. Rose J had considered the point fairly shortly herself, dismissing it in only five short paragraphs, but she had formed the view that "Applying the test set out by Lord Toulson points firmly in favour of rejecting the illegality defence put forward by Daiwa."
The third issue was whether the claim ought to fail because any breach by Daiwa was not causative of the loss. The appellants relied upon "Berg Sons &amp; Co v Adams" [1992] BCC 661. In that case Hobhouse J had held that the directing mind of the company, to whom an auditor's report was directed, already knew the true facts. Therefore, his knowledge was attributed to the company, which meant that the company did not rely on the auditor's report, and the claim failed. The situation here, the appellants submitted, was exactly the same: once Singularis is identified with Mr Al Sanea's fraud, it is a dishonest company, and was not relying on Daiwa to perform its "Quincecare" duty.
The Court of Appeal dismissed that argument. It has already held that the fraud of its principal was not to be attributed to Singularis. But the court went on to hold that, even if Mr Al Sanea's fraud were to be attributed, the claim would still be rejected because the directors of Singularis who were not acting fraudulently were indeed relying on Daiwa for the performance of its "Quincecare" duty.
The appellants argued, in reliance upon the decision of Evans-Lombe J's decision in "Barings plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand" [2003] PNLR 34, that Daiwa should have an equal and opposite claim in deceit against Singularis.
The Court of Appeal rejected that contention. The court accepted that, ordinarily, a third party who was misled by Mr Al Sanea's false statements into entering into a transaction would be able to recover all losses flowing from that transaction. But in this case Daiwa was not an ordinary third party; it was in breach of a pre-existing legal duty to Singularis to refrain from making the payments whilst the circumstances put it on inquiry. Accordingly, the court held that, even if Mr Al Sanea's fraud were to be attributed to Singularis (which it was not), Singularis's claim cannot be defeated by an equal and opposite claim in deceit by Daiwa against Singularis.
The appellants argued that these claims were all brought by, and for the indirect benefit of, the creditors of Singularis (through the liquidator). The trial judge had held that there was no principle of law which entitled the court to consider what a party intended to do with the money it recovers, and that the solvency or insolvency of Singularis did not affect that principle. The Court of Appeal broadly endorsed that, holding "the identity of those creditors cannot in this situation affect the question of whether the company in liquidation has a claim against Daiwa for breach of its "Quincecare" duty."
The Court of Appeal indicated that to set aside an assessment of contributory the appellants would need to show that the trial judge had either made an error of principle or reached a conclusion wholly outside the range of reasonable possibilities. They quickly dismissed the suggestion saying that appellant's arguments "do not get off the ground".
The Court of Appeal dismissed all of Daiwa's claims in the appeal, and upheld the decision of the trial judge that it was liable to Singularis for its breach of the "Quincecare" duty to scrutinise instructions which would put an ordinary banker on notice of fraud.
Sir Geoffrey added a few remarks in closing. He stressed that it will be a rare situation for a bank to be put on inquiry under the "Quincecare" duty, and that there is a high threshold. In this case "any reasonable banker would have realised that there were many obvious, even glaring, signs that Mr Al Sanea was perpetrating a fraud on the company when he instructed that the money be paid to other parts of his business operations". He stress that this case was an unusual one.
He also noted Daiwa sought to rely at every level of its argument on the existence of a prior fraud as a reason why it ought to have a successful defence. But this ignored the fact that the prior fraud is an essential ingredient of the claim for breach of the "Quincecare" duty.
Finally, he stressed in relation to the authorities that there is no proper comparison between the duties of an auditor and the duty of a banker. A banker's duties in respect of properly authorised instructions to make payments are strictly limited. The banker's duty only arises where, abnormally, the banker is put on inquiry by the particular circumstances. He approved the comments of Steyn J said in "Quincecare" that "trust, not distrust, is the basis of a bank's dealings with its customers".
Supreme Court.
In the Supreme Court the unanimous decision was handed down by Lady Hale, dismissing the appeal.
Significance.
Commentary on the decision has been broadly positive. Despite the wide-ranging grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal most of the commentary has focussed upon the first instance decision being upheld and the bank being found liable for breach of the "Quincecare" duty. "Practical Law" reported that, in the 25 years since "Quincecare" was decided, this is the first decision where a bank had ever been held to be liable for breaching the duty under English law.
Despite the comments of Sir Geoffrey Vos about the unusual facts of the case, and how liability under the "Quincecare" duty will be rare, inevitably banks will be concerned about being held liable for the frauds of others.

Laura Kamhuber

Laura Kamhuber (born 8 August 1999) is an Austrian singer. Her performance of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You", taped when she was a 13-year-old on the 2013 German edition of "The Voice Kids", is the most watched YouTube video by an Austrian artist. She has recorded three albums.
Biography.
Kamhuber has always loved to sing, and made her first public singing appearance at the age of three at her great-grandmother's nursing home.
From the age of ten she studied vocals at the Heidenreichstein music school.
While she was still ten, she participated in the casting for the "NÖN Talent Contest" in April 2010. "That was my first stage performance," she recalls, "and I was very nervous." She finished second. Later in 2010, having turned eleven, she participated in the Austrian annual televised children's talent show titled "Kiddy Contest" where she reached the finals and finished in third place. From then on, she regularly took singing lessons and often sang at small to medium size concerts.
At a fundraiser in 2012, she sang a folk song for the first time and discovered she loved the genre. The same year she made the semifinals in another Austrian talent show, "Die große Chance" on ORF. At 13 she was the youngest singer in the contest.
In 2013, she participated in the German edition of "The Voice Kids", where she made it to the battles (or the knockout rounds) stage. Her performance of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" in the blind audition has garnered over 210 million views (as of February 2021) on YouTube, and is the most watched YouTube video by an Austrian artist. (All three judges turned and she chose to be on Lena Meyer-Landrut's team.)
Thanks to "The Voice Kids" she was noticed by people in the music industry and had a production team formed around her. Uwe Altenried (composer) and Peter and Gaby Wessely (lyricists) wrote the first song—"Wer Ordnung hält (...ist nur zu faul zum Suchen)"—just for her. That was followed by a record contract with Tyrolis Music. In the same year, Andy Borg invited her to sing her song on the Austrian folk music television show "Musikantenstadl".
On 2 January 2014, she released her debut album "Wie guat, dass i a Madl bin", which contains 12 folk songs.
In the 2015/2016 season, with the song "Stay Tonight", she made the shortlist of the Facebook (online) selection for the wildcard place in the Austrian national selection final for the Eurovision Song Contest.
In December 2016 she released her second single, titled "Wunder".
She was named youth ambassador for the UNESCO Club Austria's Gold Ribbon Campaign "Warriors and Angels" in early 2017. In late 2017 she released her third album "Träume", produced by David Ritt for Ritt Sound. The album contains various styles of songs from pop music to country to soulful ballads.

Bruce Coughlin

Bruce Coughlin ( ) is an American orchestrator and musical arranger. He has won a Tony Award (out of 3 total nominations), a Drama Desk Award (out of 11 total nominations), and an Obie Award.
Personal life.
He currently lives in the East Village, New York City.
Career.
After graduating from Dartmouth College Coughlin moved to New York City and worked as a composer for several years, primarily writing incidental music for plays and dance. Theaters he composed scores for include The Hartford Stage ("Antony and Cleopatra"), BAM Theater Company ("A Midsummer Night’s Dream" and "The Winter’s Tale"), Denver Center Theater and many others.
He has said that composing did not suit his personality as well as orchestrating and with the 1981 musical "Is There Life After High School?" (by Craig Carnelia and Jeffrey Kindley) he got the opportunity to move into writing orchestrations for the theater. He had been hired as musical director of the show, but was asked to also do orchestrations on the side. The show had a regional run at Hartford Stage in CT and a year later arrived on Broadway. It had a lengthy preview period at the Ethyl Barrymore Theatre but a short run of only 12 performances. Despite what must have been a disappointing start to orchestrating for the theater the "side job" eventually became his primary focus. Since that time he has orchestrated over 100 works for Broadway and other theater, opera, recordings and concert hall.
After a period of working in the commercial world as a composer and arranger (for jingles and industrials), Coughlin came back to orchestrating for the theater with William Finn’s "Romance In Hard Times" at the Public Theater in 1989. He continued to orchestrate various shows off-Broadway and in regional theaters (including William Bolcom’s "Casino Paradise").
His first big theater success was as orchestrator for Adam Guettel’s "Floyd Collins" in 1994, directed by Tina Landau. The show later played at Playwrights Horizons in New York (where he won an Obie award for his work on that show). It had a short run but made a big impact on contemporary musical theater.
Broadway and West End.
Coughlin’s first Broadway orchestrations were for revivals of classic Broadway shows including the 1996 revival of "The King and I", "The Sound of Music" (1998), and "Once Upon A Mattress" starring Sarah Jessica Parker. Later he also orchestrated revivals of "On the Town" and "Annie Get Your Gun" (starring Bernadette Peters).
Original Broadway musicals he has orchestrated include "Triumph of Love" (starring Betty Buckley), "The Wild Party" (Michael John LaChiusa), "Urinetown" (for which he received a Tony Award nomination), Dolly Parton's "9 to 5", "Amélie" and "War Paint" (starring Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole).
In 2005, he collaborated with Ted Sperling and Adam Guettel on orchestrations for Guettel’s "The Light in the Piazza" which became “a surprise popular hit”. The show garnered all three a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for best orchestrations that year.
Coughlin has also provided additional orchestrations for the Broadway musicals "Big Fish", "On the Twentieth Century" (2015 revival) and "Something Rotten!", among others.
In 2014, he orchestrated another revival (of sorts) when he expanded his original 5-piece orchestration of "Urinetown" for the London premiere of the show thirteen years later. The expanded orchestration only added one additional player (a trumpet) but required rewriting of all the wind instruments in the show. He has written that this 6-piece expanded version is what he had always wanted for the original Broadway version, but the budget didn't allow for the extra player. The London production had a successful run at the St James Theatre (now The Other Palace) and then moved to the West End.
Long-time collaborations.
Coughlin has had long-running collaborations with three prominent composers: Michael John LaChiusa, the songwriting team of Scott Frankel (music) and Michael Korie (lyrics), and with opera and theater composer Ricky Ian Gordon. For LaChiusa he orchestrated 6 shows and one opera including "Giant" (Larry Hochman provided additional orchestrations), "The Wild Party", "See What I Wanna See", and "First Daughter Suite" (a co-orchestration with Michael Starobin).
For Frankel and Korie, he orchestrated "Grey Gardens" (for which he received a Tony Award nomination), "Far From Heaven", "Happiness" (directed by Susan Stroman), "Finding Neverland" (UK version) and "War Paint".
He co-orchestrated (with the composer) three major Gordon operas ("The Grapes of Wrath", "27" and "Morning Star") and (as sole orchestrator) three musicals.
International.
Coughlin has also worked extensively overseas, providing orchestrations for five new musicals at Søren Møller's Fredericia Teater in Denmark; for revivals of "Candide" (in a chamber music orchestration for the National Theatre), "Assassins" and the aforementioned "Urinetown" in London; and for 3 musicals (co-orchestrations with Larry Hochman) by María Isabel Murillo MISI in Bogotá, Colombia.
Recordings and classical work.
In the non-theater realm, he has written orchestrations for many singers (for both concert and recording) including Audra McDonald, Kristen Chenoweth, Julian Fleisher, Nadine Sierra, and Darius de Haas.
In the classical world, Coughlin has often worked with conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, notably as orchestrator for Bernstein’s "Arias and Barcarolles", "The Thomashevsky Project" (with co-orchestrator Peter Gordon) and on the 1992 recording of Bernstein's "On the Town", where he orchestrated two songs cut from the original 1944 production. Those songs ("Gabey's Comin’" and "The Intermission's Great") had never been orchestrated but were added back for this new recording. "Gabey’s Comin’" is now a part of the currently available live-performance version of the show. In 2016 they collaborated once again on one of Tilson Thomas's own compositions ("Four Preludes on Playthings of the Wind)" with Coughlin supplying orchestration assistance as the score was finalized.
It was Tilson Thomas who suggested Coughlin to Bruce Hornsby who was assembling a concert suite of four songs to be premiered at the New World Symphony in 2015. In his writing Hornsby had become interested in the techniques of modern classical music (Ligeti, Carter, Schoenberg, etc.) and was experimenting with ways to meld those compositional techniques with his own signature pop music style. The concert was a success and the collaboration continued. The suite now consists of eleven songs.
Metallica and S&amp;M2.
In 2019 he joined forces with Metallica and Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony to create arrangements and orchestrations for S&amp;M2, marking the 20th anniversary of the legendary S&amp;M concert of 1999. Many of the original Michael Kamen orchestrations were used, and the concert updated with Metallica material from the last 20 years. Coughlin arranged and orchestrated "Moth Into Flame", "Halo On Fire", "Confusion", "The Day That Never Comes", "Unforgiven III", and "All Within My Hands". He also wrote a new orchestration for Master of Puppets from the original S&amp;M concert and adapted and reworked Geoff Alexander and Michael Kamen's Enter Sandman chart. S&amp;M2 was the inaugural concert in the new Chase Center arena in San Francisco. Performances took place September 6 and 8 with a world-wide one-night-only movie screening planned for the following month.

Game of the scene

Game of the scene is a concept in the longform format of improvisational theater.
Definitions.
There are various ways to define the Game of the scene, as different clubs will have their own interpretations of it. Some common definitions are:
Application.
Working the concept into a player’s scene work is known as “playing the game”. When the Game is discovered the players have two ways to apply it into the scene.
Exploring.
Players can explore the Game by delving into the psychology of their characters and try to understand why they do the things that they do.
Heightening.
The Game can be escalated by raising the stakes. A character’s actions can be taken to the extreme or they can be placed in more absurd situations to see how the Game plays out.
Moving beyond the game.
It is noted that focusing too much on trying to find the Game can cause players to miss the game entirely. Some players say that one should not pay too much attention while performing, and that they should only try to have fun. The Game will naturally arise so long as the player focuses on the immediate relationship.

Wisconsin dairy barn

A Wisconsin dairy barn is a style of barn developed presumably in the U.S. state of Wisconsin, but present in other U.S. states, especially further west.
"The introduction of the Wisconsin Dairy Barn, which was actively promoted by the University of Wisconsin School of Agriculture, incorporated the scientific knowledge of the turn-of-the-[20th-]century. Ample light and ventilation, a gambrel roof to increase storage space for hay, built-in manure and hay tracks, and poured concrete floors for sanitation, all reflected the technological requirements necessary to run a modern dairy operation."
Wisconsin dairy barns became popular in Ohio.

Sword of Honour (2001 film)

Sword of Honour is a 2001 British television film directed by Bill Anderson and starring Daniel Craig. Scripted by William Boyd, it is based on the "Sword of Honour" trilogy of novels by Evelyn Waugh, which loosely parallel Waugh's own experiences in the Second World War. 
Reception.
Commenting in "The Daily Telegraph", its Defence Editor, John Keegan, said: "To reduce Waugh's enormous text to a short television treatment presented William Boyd with a daunting challenge. He has met it magnificently... Boyd's compressions improve Waugh's plot. At the literary level, therefore, Boyd passes all the tests. The failure is at the directorial level. Bill Anderson has either simply not grasped or has flinched from depicting how utterly different the Britain of 1939–45 is from Tony Blair's. His lack of grasp or nerve has affected his actors – though some of them may also be guilty of not having immersed themselves in the books, inexcusably, since Waugh is the most readable of novelists. As a result, characters appear either as caricatures or as pale approximations of Waughian realities".
Filming locations.
Edinburgh was one of the locations for filming.

Slab detachment

In plate tectonics, slab detachment or slab break-off may occur during continent-continent or arc-continent collisions. When the continental margin of the subducting plate reaches the oceanic trench of the subduction zone, the more buoyant continental crust will in normal circumstances experience only a limited amount of subduction into the asthenosphere. The slab pull forces will, however, still be present and this normally leads to the breaking off or detachment of the descending slab from the rest of the plate. The isostatic response to the detachment of the downgoing slab is rapid uplift. Slab detachment is also followed by the upwelling of relatively hot asthenosphere to fill the gap created, leading in many cases to magmatism.
The uncritical use of the slab-detachment model to explain disparate observations of magmatism, uplift and exhumation in continental collision zones has been criticised.
Slab tears.
Detachment initiates at a particular point on the slab and will then propagate laterally along the descending slab, forming a slab tear. The propagation of the detachment will be accompanied by lateral migration of both the associated uplift and the magmatism. Such laterally propagating tears have been recognised from several collision zones, such as the Hindu Kush part of the Himalayan Belt. The Tertiary magmatism in the Alps observed along the Insubric Line has been argued to result from a rapidly propagating slab tear following continental collision and the initiation of slab breakoff.

Elizabeth Zvonar

Elizabeth Zvonar (born 1972) is a Canadian contemporary artist that works primarily with mixed-media collage and sculpture based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She is currently represented by Daniel Faria Gallery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Life and education.
Zvonar was born in Thunder Bay, Ontario. She has attended Aichi Gakusen University in Toyota City, Japan (1994), Capilano College in North Vancouver, Canada (1995), and Hokkaido University of Art &amp; Design in Sapporo, Japan (1996). She ultimately received a BFA at Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver, Canada in 2002, the same institution that would later reward her with the Emily Award for Outstanding Achievement by an Emily Carr Alumna in 2011.
Work.
Working extensively with collage materials, Zvonar’s practice works towards presenting a new history by collecting images from a variety of sources (advertisements, lifestyle, and art history) and reinterpreting them through juxtaposition. By working with images of the female body, Zvonar’s work reinterprets the use of female representation through a reductive and additive process that investigates the nuances and disparities of printed material in relation to identity formation.
Solo Exhibitions.
Zvonar has exhibited at the Contemporary Art Gallery, Daniel Faria Gallery, Artspeak, and the Vancouver Art Gallery Offsite. In 2017, Zvonar participated in a residency at the Burrard Arts Foundation, where she exhibited her solo show "To You it Was Fast." 
Her work "THE CHALLENGE OF ABSTRACTION was exhibited at the Daniel Faria Gallery, Toronto from May 2 to June 6, 2015." Zvonar exhibited collages, sculptures, and casts. One of her featured works, "IT’S THE GAPS THAT CHANGE THE SEQUENCE", "presents two different images of open legs arranged in a mesmerizing spiral." 
In 2018 her show "Banal Baroque" was presented at Daniel Faria Gallery, which explored themes of "bodily and sexual excess" by "recontextualizing mass-produced objects, mass media objects, magazines, and mannequin parts to animate the uncanny treatment of the human figure that lies dormant in this source material." Her work is noted to evoke Surrealist and Dadaist collage, particularly those of Hannah Höch. Amongst the exhibited works were "Marcel Meets Judy" (2013), which featured a "mass-produced pink seashell candy dish." This object was rendered obsolete from its function and references Marcel Duchamp’s readymades and Judy Chicago’s porcelain vagina-flowers in "The Dinner Party", 1974-1979.

Elizabeth Zvonar's artworks can be found in the following collections:
Solo Exhibitions.
Zvonar has exhibited both group and solo exhibitions across Canada, Australia, Belgium, Japan and in New York.

Helen Hall Jennings

Helen Hall Jennings (September 20, 1905 – October 4, 1966) was a social psychologist and a pioneer in the field of social networks in the early 20th century. She developed quantitative research methods used to study sociometry, a quantitative method for measuring social relationships. This work is cited as being the birth of social network analysis.
Career.
Jennings graduated from the New Jersey College for Women (now known as the Douglass Residential College at Rutgers University) in 1927 with a Bachelor of Letters degree.
Jennings pursued her graduate degree in psychology at Columbia University and specialized in empirical research design. While working in the lab of psychologist Gardner Murphy, she met Jacob L. Moreno. Through her knowledge of quantitative research methods and statistics, Jennings worked with Moreno to develop an empirical approach to social network research. Together they studied how "social relations affected psychological well-being” and “used quantitative methods for studying the structure of groups and the positions of individuals within groups."
Jennings and Moreno's research at Sing Sing and the New York Training School for Girls (also known as Hudson School for the Girls) "involved systematic data collection and analysis" and resulted in two published works: "Application of the Group Method to Classification" in 1932, and "Who Shall Survive? A New Approach to the Problem of Human Interrelations" in 1934. This research is responsible for the development of sociometry. During this time, Jennings and Moreno also became the first to use a stochastic network model (or, "chance sociogram", as they called it), predating the Erdős–Rényi model and the network model of Anatol Rapoport.
In 1931, Jennings received her Master of Arts degree from Columbia University. Her master's thesis was entitled "The nature of the pathetic." At that time she was living in Stelton, New Jersey. In 1943, Jennings completed her PhD thesis "Leadership and Isolation: A Study of Personality in Interpersonal Relations". It was published by Longman, Greens, and Company.
"Leadership and Isolation" strove to examine how often-chosen leaders and isolates arise in a population. It was a continuation of analysis from the data collected at the New York Training School for Girls. Research subjects were asked who they would like to work with and who they would like to live with. Eight months later, there was little change in the selected leaders and isolates.
Benjamin Karpman, a psychiatrist, reviewed the first edition of "Leadership and Isolation" for the "Journal of Clinical Psychology". In his review, he describes the importance of Jennings' research. Karpman closes his review encouraging all psychiatrists to read Jennings’ book, stating "it offers the most profound analysis of leadership and isolation in the social process this reviewer has discovered in the field of social psychology."
A second edition of "Leadership and Isolation" was published by Longman, Greens, and Company in 1950. Morris Janowitz, a founder of military sociology, reviewed the book for the "American Journal of Sociology". In his review, Janowitz wrote that "Leadership and Isolation" "can be viewed as an ingenious empirical study which helped fashion sociometry as a research tool."
According to structural sociologist Linton C. Freeman, the empirical methods developed by Jennings and applied in Moreno's sociometry studies laid the groundwork for future social network research: "Clearly, with a great deal of help from Jennings and Lazarsfeld, Moreno had developed an approach that included all of the defining properties of social network analysis. It was based on structural intuitions, it involved the collection of systematic empirical data, graphic imagery was an integral part of its tools and it embodied an explicit mathematical model. That structural perspective, moreover, was generalized to a range of phenomena. Thus, the group led by Moreno displayed all four of the features that define social network analysis."Freeman draws the conclusion that Jennings was instrumental in the empirical research done in support of theories from Moreno:"My own suspicion is that Jennings's contributions were immense. Moreno had no research training at all, and until this point, he had shown absolutely no interest in systematic research. All of his earlier publications were couched in heavy mysticism. But his newer works–those produced during his collaboration with Jennings–were comparatively systematic and were, for the first time, empirically grounded. The obvious conclusion is that, though the intuitive ideas came from Moreno, the completed research and the publications drew heavily on the contributions of Jennings. Jennings, it seems, was not only a collaborator but she was, in Moreno's terms, a very powerful 'muse.'"

Daling River

The Daling River () is a river in Northeast China. With a length of , it is the main river in the arid western part of Liaoning. Its drainage basin covers , 85% of which is located in Liaoning, 13% in Inner Mongolia and the remaining 2% in Hebei.
Course.
The Daling River has two sources. The southern source is Shuiquan Creek () in the village of Wukunzhangzi (吴坤杖子) in Jianchang County, Liaoning. The northern source is Quanzi Creek (泉子沟) in the village of Songyingzi (宋营子) in Pingquan, Hebei. The two source streams meet at Dachengzi, Kazuo County, Liaoning. From there the river flows northeast past the city of Chaoyang into Baishi Reservoir, where it receives Mangniu River (牤牛河) from the north. Baishi Reservoir is Liaoning's third largest reservoir with a capacity of . The reservoir was built on the Daling River between 1995 and 2001, primarily for flood control purposes, and secondarily to supply water to nearby urban and agricultural areas. At Baishi Reservoir the river turns southeast, passing the towns of Yixian and Linghai before entering Liaodong Bay in the Bohai Sea.
History and toponymy.
The Neolithic Hongshan culture flourished in the Daling River basin between 4500 and 3000 BCE, as evidenced at sites such as Niuheliang and Dongshanzui. The river was known as Bailangshui (白狼水) in the Han and Tang dynasties. It became known as the Ling River (灵河) in the Liao dynasty, which was rewritten as 凌河 in the Jin. Later it acquired the modifier "great" (大) to distinguish it from the "little" Ling River (小凌河) to its southwest.

Freethinkers Society

The Freethinkers Society was an American organization founded as the Freethinkers' Society of New York in 1915. Later renamed, the society was behind a number of lawsuits seeking to ensure the separation of church and state.
History.
Founding of the organization.
The society was founded in 1915. In January 1920, under the auspices of the Freethinkers' Society, Thomas Wright lectured in New York on Nietzsche and Thomas Paine in Manhattan.
The society was behind a number of lawsuits seeking to ensure the separation of church and state. In 1925, the society was suing Mount Vernon, New York to stop school authorities from requiring children to attend religious services, with the case picked up as important by attorney Clarence Darrow. As of 1926, publisher Joseph Lewis remained president. After a court order favored their suit in early 1926, later that year, the society instituted injunction proceedings against the Board of Education of White Plains, New York over the decision of Supreme Court Justice Ellis J. Staley to allow time out for children's religious instruction. In May 1927, the Freethinkers' Society of New York took a decision on religious teaching to the Supreme Court on an appeal, after the court upheld the "religious training of public school children during schools hours at churches by parents." 
Incorporation and renaming.
In 1928, Lewis incorporated The Freethinkers Society, renaming it "The Freethinkers of America" and becoming its president. 
In March 1930, at a luncheon honoring Philip J. Peabody, it was announced the society would move to legally force the Board of Education to eliminate the reading of the Bible in public schools. It was announced that Mayor Joseph Wheless, attorney for the association, would handle the case, with aid offered by Clarence Darrow, Arthur Garfield Hays and Stephen B. Vreeland.
As of November 1935, Freethinkers of America had 30,000 members at $1 a year for membership, with Lewis still president.
In 1936, Lewis denied that three honorary vice presidents had resigned, after the National Conference of Christians and Jews declared that Rupert Hughes, Clarence Darrow, and Harry Elmer Barnes had removed their names. Barnes confirmed he had argued with Lewis over Lewis' annual statement denouncing Yom Kippur, but had not resigned.
The society successfully challenged the use of public school buildings for religious training in 1948, with a decision by the Supreme Court despite protests by religious groups. In 1956, the organization sued to attempt to remove the "under god" from the Pledge of Allegiance, which had been added the year before. In 1958, the Freethinkers of America filed a suit over a hospital ban prohibiting birth-control therapy in New York city hospitals. Lewis died in 1968 after decades of activity with the organization.

Grossman model of health demand

The Grossman model of health demand is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care outlined by Michael Grossman in a monograph in 1972 entitled: "The demand for health: A theoretical and empirical investigation". The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the "founding father of demand for health models".
Model.
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time. In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.
The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.
Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.
Theoretical expansions.
The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.
The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich. Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand.
Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.
Empirical estimation.
Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by Joseph Newhouse in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This study sought to estimate income, money price, and time price elasticities of demand for medical care. Another important study was the Oregon Health Insurance in the late 2000s and also estimated the role of public health provision on healthcare demand and was led by Katherine Baicker and Amy Finkelstein.
Criticisms.
In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dichotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.
Similarly, critics of Grossman's model have conceptualized the issue not from the point of view of healthcare demand, but the avoidance of illness which in itself is a disutility. In that sense, poor health is seen as a factor diminishing or interrupting an individual's ability to achieve maximum utility, with death being seen as a permanent interruption. 
In another departure from Grossman's model on the question of expenditures and demand over time, University of Maryland Economics professor Maureen Cropper argues that healthcare demand should be delineated between preventative care and treatment of illness, the latter of which is often correlated with end of life treatment and can be seen as more random based on illness occurrence. The former variable is more predictable, but very much correlated to those earlier in their life cycle and present in the labor market.
Additionally, researchers have questioned the independence of the individual variables in the model such as education, income, as well as socioeconomic and occupation status. Particular attention had been paid to riskier professions, which generally entail higher wages due to occupational hazards and thus make such variable co-dependent. Much to the same point, Dr. Victor Fuchs argues that both genetic and gendered differences operate as unobserved, immutable variables within the model.

Ulli Steltzer

Ulli Steltzer (2 October 1923 - 27 July 2018) was a German photographer best known for her works photographing First Nations people and art in B.C., Canada, including Haida artist Bill Reid. Steltzer had numerous exhibits in and around Vancouver, and both Princeton University and the University of Victoria have collections of her works.
Biography.
Ulli Steltzer was born in 1923 in Frankfurt, Germany.
She immigrated to the United States in 1953, where she opened her first portrait studio on Tulane Street in Princeton, New Jersey. Her photographs of Princeton’s famous locals and visitors quickly gained her recognition across the country.
In the late 1960s, her work evolved to reflect the social issues of the time. She photographed black people under segregation, standing out from the other documentary photographers with her focus on the people, rather than their environment. She later wrote that "[she] was chilled by the discrimination [she] saw practised against black Americans... Since then [she] devoted a good part of [her] life to documenting the lives and works of men and women of different minorities, both here and abroad."
Steltzer moved to Vancouver in 1972 and started photographing local indigenous people and their artwork. She is quoted saying that she stopped inside a store selling native goods, asked who had created a hand-woven basket and was appalled when the owner couldn't tell her. She credits this experience with her desire to create a book about indigenous artists at work. She used an unobtrusive hand-held Rollei camera to seek out "British Columbia's native artists in their own places, met them informally and recorded their rediscovery of their old skills".
Steltzer was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Victoria in 1997.
Steltzer died July 27, 2018 at the age of 94.
Works.
She published numerous photographic collections, including:

De La Galette Lake

The Lac de la Galette (English: "De La Galette Lake") is a freshwater body of the town of La Tuque, in Haute-Mauricie, forming a bay on the south shore of Gouin Reservoir and west of the upper Saint-Maurice River, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake is mainly located in the township of Delage, except for a bay on the east shore that receives the waters of the Leblanc River (Gouin Reservoir), which penetrates eastward into the township of Leblanc. Following the erection completed in 1948 of the Gouin dam, the "Lac de la Galette" became an extension of the Bouzanquet Bay which is an extension to the south of Gouin Reservoir.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.
The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the valleys of the De La Galette River (Gouin Reservoir) and the Leblanc River (Gouin Reservoir); this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of the "De La Galette Lake" is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.
Toponymy.
The toponym "Lac de la Galette" was formalized on December 18, 1986, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Berry graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico in 1956. In 1960, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where in 1958 he won the Academy of American Poets Prize. He went on to earn his Juris Doctor degree from Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois in 1965 and was admitted to the Nebraska State Bar in 1965. Berry graduated from the Infantry Officer School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School in Charlottesville, Virginia.
As a Captain in Vietnam, Berry was awarded the Bronze Star and the Vietnamese Medal of Honor First Class (Gold). He served as defense counsel with the 1st Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 199th Light Infantry Brigade, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 101st Airborne, the 82nd Airborne, and the 5th Special Forces on a temporary basis.
Berry is recognized in the New Mexico Military Institute Hall of Fame. He is also the recipient of the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (with Palm) and the recipient for the FBI Award for Service in the Public Interest.
Green Beret Affair and "Those Gallant Men: On Trial in Vietnam".
In Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, Berry was the chief defense counsel for the largest general court martial jurisdiction in Vietnam, II Field Force Vietnam, numbering more than 80,000 soldiers. His work on the defense counsel includes the "Green Beret Affair", where in 1969 members of the Green Berets were charged with the murder of a double agent.
Berry wrote on his first-hand experiences as a lawyer fighting in a combat zone in "Those Gallant Men: On Trial in Vietnam", published May 1, 1984. The book examines the charges filed against the Green Berets and maneuvers through the legal proceedings of the trial, offering an insider's view through stories and explanations of the dynamics and strategy of litigation between the CIA, the US Army, and the Green Berets during the Vietnam War. His work in the field was also featured in the book "Judge Advocates in Combat: Army Lawyers in Military Operations from Vietnam to Haiti" by Fred Borch.
Law career.
Following his military service, Berry was briefly associated with Henry B. Rothblatt Offices in New York from 1970 through 1971. There, he tried a number of high-profile cases before returning to Lincoln, Nebraska to continue regional practice primarily in the areas of criminal defense, drug crimes, driving while intoxicated, white collar crime, state and federal felony practice, veterans appeals and murder.
In 2000, Berry's son, John Berry Jr., left the army to pursue a law degree and join Berry Law Firm. His son Rory Berry also works at the law firm.
In 1986, Berry was the Civilian Defense Counsel for one of the biggest drug busts in Japanese history.
Berry has appeared in court in 24 states and two foreign countries. He has been invited to lecture on issues regarding criminal defense in the military at the Judge Advocate General's School at the University of Virginia, and has conducted seminars in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City, Missouri for practicing lawyers. He has achieved the distinguished AV Preeminent Rating by Martindale-Hubbell and was selected for inclusion in Super Lawyers. Berry Law Firm is listed in the Martindale-Hubbell Bar Register of Preeminent Attorneys.
In 2014, Berry co-authored the book "The Twelfth Victim: The Innocence of Caril Fugate in the Starkweather Murder Rampage" with Ohio lawyer Linda Battisti on Caril Ann Fugate, the teen girlfriend who accompanied spree killer Charles Starkweather during the murders of 1958. The book was recommended by Steven Drizin, attorney for Brendan Dassey, whose case gained international attention due to the Netflix series "Making a Murderer," which exposed the prosecution's coercion of Dassey resulting in a false confession.
Berry is a member of the Melvin Belli Society, and a fellow on the American Board of Criminal Defense Lawyers and of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
Personal life.
While practicing law, Berry hosted "The John Stevens Berry Show" for more than a decade, first airing on KLIN and later on KZUM. The last day of the show, August 1, 1997, was declared John Stevens Berry Day by the former governor of Nebraska, Ben Nelson.

1984 UK Athletics Championships

The 1984 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Cwmbran Stadium, Cwmbran. It was the third time the event was held in the Welsh town, following on from its hosting in 1977 and 1982. The competition was affected by heavy winds that year, particularly the jumps and sprints.
It was the eighth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1984 AAA Championships.
Fatima Whitbread won her fourth consecutive women's javelin throw UK title, while Aston Moore won his third straight men's triple jump title. Aside from Moore, four men successfully defended their 1983 titles and Peter Elliott (1500 metres), Keith Stock (pole vault), Derrick Brown (long jump) and Peter Yates (javelin). Venissa Head was the only woman to defend her title, doing so in the discus throw. Heather Oakes was the only athlete to win multiple UK titles, taking the women's 100 metres and 200 metres to repeat a feat she had achieved five years previously.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1984 Olympic Games. Reflecting the secondary nature of the UK competition and the fact it was not used as the Olympic trial event, only one of the 14 British individual Olympic medallists took a UK title that year – Fatima Whitbread. British Olympic relay medallists Simmone Jacobs, Heather Oakes and Kriss Akabusi were present at the UK Championships, however.

SS Australasia

The Australasia was a wooden hulled American Great Lakes freighter that served on the Great Lakes of North America between her construction in 1884 to her burning and sinking in 1896. On October 18, 1896 while loaded with coal, the "Australasia" sank in Lake Michigan near the town of Sevastopol, Door County, Wisconsin, United States, after burning off Cana Island. On July 3, 2013 the wreck of the "Australasia" was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The "Australasia" (Official number 106302) was built in 1884 in West Bay City, Michigan by the shipyard owned by Captain James Davidson. She was built for the Davidson Steamship Company which was also owned by Captain Davidson. At a length of the "Australasia" was one of the largest wooden ships ever built; her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a fore and aft compound engine which was fueled by two coal burning Scotch marine boilers. She had a gross tonnage of 1829.32 tons and a net tonnage of 1539.20 tons.
On September 17, 1884, the "Australasia" was launched as hull number #9. At the time of her launch the "Australasia" was the largest wooden-hulled ship in the world. Because of her enormous size the "Australasia" needed iron cross bracing, an iron keelson, iron plates, and several iron arches to increase her strength.
She was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain and sometimes salt. She could carry these cargoes so efficiently that she earned a fortune for her owners at a time when small, less versatile wooden vessels were quickly being replaced by larger, and stronger iron or steel vessels. Just like all ships owned by Captain Davidson, the "Australasia" used to tow a wooden schooner barge.
Final voyage.
On October 17, 1896, the "Australasia" was bound from a port on Lake Erie for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, carrying 2,200 tons of soft coal. At around 6:00 p.m. near Baileys Harbor, the crew of the "Australasia" discovered "a fire beneath the texas on the main deck". They attempted to fight the blaze but failed. The crew abandoned the "Australasia" before she reached Jacksonport, Wisconsin. At 10:30 p.m., the "Australasia" was about four hours off Jacksonport when the tugboat "John Leathem" came upon the struggling steamer. The "Leathem" began towing the "Australasia" to shore, but the hawser connecting them kept burning through. At 9:00 a.m. on October 18, 1896, the crew of the "Leathem" gave up trying to salvage her and instead dragged her onto the beach in of water south of Cave Point. Her crew decided to scuttle her, by ramming a hole in the "Australasia"&amp;apos;s side with the "Leathem"&amp;apos;s stem. She burned until the night of October 18, 1896.
The "Australasia" today.
The "Australasia" was declared a total loss. Much of her cargo of soft coal and machinery was salvaged, however her hull was beyond repair and was abandoned. Today her lower hull lies mostly buried in sand 15 to 20 feet of water off Whitefish Dunes State Park. Because most of her hull remains buried in sand, there is the possibility that different hull sections may be uncovered which may reveal more significant information about her construction. Not a trace of her cargo is visible on the site of her wreck, but traces of coal is visible on a beach nearby. The wreck of the "Australasia" is rarely visited by divers which means that very little site disturbance to the site has occurred. Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the early steel freighter "Lakeland", the large wooden bulk carrier "Frank O'Connor, the wooden steamer "Louisiana" which was lost during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, the schooner "Christina Nilsson" and the steamboat "Joys".

Rachel Kerina Chikwamba is a Zimbabwean plant geneticist born in 1967. She is in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Group Executive: Strategic Alliances and Communication. She is an active member of the Academy of Science of South Africa.
Research and career.
Chikwamba obtained an undergraduate degree in Crop Science from the University of Zimbabwe, and later graduated from the University of Queensland with a Master's degree. In 2002, she obtained her PhD in genetics from Iowa State University, with a dissertation exploring the production of novel proteins in plants. She then worked as a post-doctoral research associate at Arizona State University's Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccinology within the Biodesign Institute. There, her research focused on the expression and assembly of plant proteins. Chikwamba also holds an MBA from the Gordon Institute of Business Science at the University of Pretoria.
Chikwamba's research involves plant manufactured pharmaceuticals and metabolic engineering. Using mainly sorghum, maize and banana, she explores three main research avenues: improving the nutritional quality of food crops; using plants to produce biomolecules of pharmaceutical interest; and investigating biochemical pathways of indigenous plants with medicinal value.
Chikwamba chairs the board of the Applied Centre for Climate and Earth Systems Science (ACCESS). She has worked at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) since 2004, in various capacities. She helped develop the Health Research Impact Area strategy, and served two terms on the CSIR's Strategic Research Panel. As Chief Researcher and Competence Area Manager at CSIR Biosciences, she facilitated major global partnerships for CSIR, and was the lead for the African Biofortified Sorghum (ABS) project, which aim to produce nutritionally fortified sorghum, focusing on pro-vitamin A, protein quality and mineral bioavailability. As a principal investigator for CSIR, she led a number of both internationally and locally funded projects including European Union Framework projects, the Gates Grand Challenge on nutritional fortification, the GreenPharm initiative (which aims to make antibody therapeutics using plant-based technology), and New Partnership for Africa's Development/Biofisa projects. Chikwamba was on the team which produced RabiVir, an antibody treatment made from plant leaves to treat rabies.
In October 2011, she was made CSIR Group Executive: Strategic Alliances and Communication, and in this capacity she managed partnerships, stakeholder interactions, and associated communication. She also held the position of CSIR Group Executive: Chemicals, Agriculture, Food and Health. In late 2019, Chikwamba was elected the Director General of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), but for personal reasons did not take up the position.
During her career, Chikwamba was also a lecturer with the University of Pretoria's Departments of Plant Science, of Botany, and of Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI). In this capacity, she leads a program to genetically improve banana and maize crops. She was made an Honorary Research Fellow at St George’s Hospital at the University of London.

Artur Talvik

Artur Talvik (born 13 June 1964) is an Estonian politician, film director, film producer, actor, and screenwriter. He was a member of the Riigikogu and a former member of the Estonian Free Party. He now leads the Richness of Life party.
Biography.
Talvik is the son of and Mati Talvik, a television director and television journalist, respectively. He graduated from the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre in 1988 and starting in 1992, was an actor at Nukuteater. He later became a prolific filmmaker, directing and producing movies all throughout the 1990s and 2000s, most notably "Vene metalli ja US $ suudlus", "Ööliblika jõulud", "Waterbomb for the Fat Tomcat" (Estonian: Veepomm paksule kõutsile), "December Heat", and "". In 2010, he participated in the TV3 series "Laulud tähtedega" with Lenna Kuurmaa. He was married to actress Epp Eespäev, with whom he has two children, a son and daughter. The couple later divorced. He is married to Anneli Kalle-Talvik, a physician with who he has a daughter. He is also a stepfather.
Political career.
During the 2011 Riigikogu elections, Talvik ran as an independent representing Harju and Rapla counties. In the 2015 Riigikogu elections, he ran as an independent under the Estonian Free Party list, being billed as a vote magnet due to his popularity, as well as running on a campaign message of anti-corruption, and received 7,307 votes in the same district, being elected to the Riigikogu. He was fined due to protesting a law that prohibited outside political ads after the cutoff date before an election by having campaign ads on his car after the date had passed, claiming it creates disadvantages for a small party to gain traction.
As a member of the Riigikogu, in 2015, Talvik helped to create a committee to investigate alleged corruption in the financial dealings of the Port of Tallinn, as well as protecting state companies from corruption. He was elected to be the committee chairman of the Anti-Corruption Select Committee on 16 December 2016, with Anneli Ott of the Centre Party as deputy chairwoman. He is currently a member of the Rural Affairs Committee.
Talvik would later fully join on 8 March 2017 and become the leader of the Free Party, elected into the position on 24 April.

Global Rapid Rugby

Global Rapid Rugby is an international rugby union competition that launched a showcase series for six professional teams in 2019, played in locations across the Asia-Pacific region. Rapid Rugby matches are slightly shorter than the traditional 80 minutes and have other variations from standard rugby laws that are intended to increase the speed of the game.
The 2020 Global Rapid Rugby season was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic after only one completed round of competition.
History.
The competition was conceived and is supported by the Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest. It was devised after the Western Force rugby team based in Perth, Western Australia was unilaterally dropped from the Australian Super Rugby Conference.
Background.
Following SANZAAR's decision to reduce the number of Super Rugby teams for 2018, the Australian Rugby Union (now Rugby Australia) announced in August 2017 that the Western Force would be one of the teams cut from the 2018 competition. In the following month, Perth-based businessman Andrew Forrest announced that he would create a new tournament called the Indo Pacific Rugby Championship which would include the Western Force and five other teams from the Indo-Pacific region.
For the 2018 season, the competition was launched as World Series Rugby, played as a series of exhibition matches as the precursor to a wider Asia-Pacific competition planned for 2019. The newly reformed Western Force played international teams from Hong Kong, Samoa, and Tonga along with Super Rugby teams the Crusaders and Melbourne Rebels, Japanese Top League team Panasonic Wild Knights, and the Fiji Warriors, the second-tier national side. The series began on 4 May 2018.
Rapid Rugby launched.
The competition was re-branded in November 2018 as Global Rapid Rugby, and the Hong Kong Rugby Union was appointed the governing body for the competition ahead of the 2019 season. A season of fourteen matches was played in 2019, featuring the Western Force playing a Pacific Showcase Series in a round-robin format with teams from Fiji and Samoa, as well as an Asian Showcase Series in a round-robin format with teams based out of Hong Kong and Singapore. One-off matches were also played against a World XV coached by Robbie Deans, and the Malaysia Valke. The Singapore-based team, the Asia Pacific Dragons, did not continue in Rapid Rugby after the 2019 season and was replaced by the China Lions in 2020.
Teams.
Six teams compete in Rapid Rugby:
Law variations.
Law variations for Rapid Rugby included:
Super Rugby in Australia averages around 30-minutes of ‘ball-in-play’ per match. However, the matches in 2018 World Series Rugby – the precursor to Rapid Rugby – had a comparable 'ball-in-play' time almost 30% greater.
Players.
Global Rapid Rugby aims to attract about 20 of the world's top 100 rugby players with marquee contracts to be spread across the eight franchises. There is no salary cap in place for the competition.
Media coverage.
Rapid Rugby currently has live broadcast television coverage in 18 countries across Asia and Oceania. Live streaming and video on demand services reach additional viewers within some Asia-Pacific countries, while Rapid Rugby's own website provides live streams and highlight packages to other regions worldwide.
For the 2019 showcase series, nine of the fourteen matches over the season were televised. Fox Sports in Australia and related companies Star Sports and Fox Sports Asia will provide the live coverage.
National broadcaster SBS showed all nine of these matches live on free-to-air television across Australia via its SBS Viceland channel and also streamed through SBS on Demand. Other Rapid Rugby media partners included Kayo Sports in Australia, Sky Sport in New Zealand and Fiji TV.
Corporate relations.
Sponsorship.
The 2019 showcase series does not currently have a principal naming rights partner, but major official partners include IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, K&amp;L Gates and Harvey Beef.
The official rugby ball supplier is Rhino Sport.

Angela Baca

Angela Tafoya Baca (1927 – 2014) was a Native American artist who was known for her redware and blackware pottery, especially melon bowls and bowls featuring a bear paw design. She had one of the longest careers of the potters in Santa Clara Pueblo in New Mexico. She was a member of the Tewa and a resident of Santa Clara Pueblo.
Personal life.
Born on November 6, 1927, Angela Tafoya Baca was the daughter of Severa and Cleto Tafoya. Her childhood home, located in the center of the plaza in Santa Clara Pueblo, later became the Merrock Galeria, which was owned and managed by her nephew Paul Speckled Rock.
Angela married Jose Antonio "Tony" Baca, who served as private first class in the United States Army during World War II. He worked for the Zia Company (later Johnson Controls), which provided support services to Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. The couple had 10 children, four of whom (David, Darryl, Leona, and Alvin) became noted Santa Clara Pueblo potters. Angela Baca died on February 16, 2014. She was interred in the Santa Fe National Cemetery.
Artistic creations.
 Angela Baca learned pottery-making techniques from her mother, Severa Tafoya, a well-known potter of Santa Clara Pueblo. According to Angela, her mother made melon bowls with large ridges, and Angela decided to make them with smaller ridges. Her initial work won first prize at the Santa Fe Indian Market, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and she decided to focus on melon bowls, both red and black, although her work includes other designs, as well. She is considered to be the matriarch of the melon potters. A photograph of Angela Baca at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 1991 is available in the Palace of the Governors Photo Archives Collection.
Four of her children have carried on their mother's tradition of making melon vessels. Sons Darryl and Alvin Baca craft melon bowls and melon jars; son David "Yellow Mountain" Baca is known for his squash design melon bowls and melon seed pots; daughter Leona Baca primarily makes miniature versions of melon bowls.
Exhibitions.
Additional exhibitions: Heard Museum, Phoenix, Arizona; National Museum of the American Indian, Washington, D.C.; Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

<doc id="56797406" url="?curid=56797406" title="Operation Hoathley 1">
Operation Hoathley 1

Operation Hoathley 1 was one of the two Special Operations Executive (SOE) exploratory missions to Yugoslav Partisans during the World War Two. Both Hoathley 1 and the second mission, Operation Fungus, flew out on the night of 20 Apr 1943 from Derna airfield. The missions' objective was to establish who the Partisans were, who was their leader and if and how they could be utilised to further the Allies' military ambitions. They also served as each other's backup, in case one failed to reach the Partisans or fell into enemy's hands.
The mission consisted of three Yugoslav Canadians who were recruited by the SOE and trained in clandestine operations at Camp X on the Lake Ontario, near the US border. It was led by Stevan Serdar who was joined by George Diklić and Milan Družić. They wore no identifiable uniform or rank.
Background.
During the Second World War, both the SOE and its military counterpart, the SIS, operated in Canada and the United States in order to recruit European immigrants as potential agents for deployment in their native countries. The policy was approved as these were often bi-lingual young men who had escaped economic or political hardship in their homelands. Some had even fought in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side.
Once selected, they were sent to Camp X for training and then dispatched to their respective regions. Those intended to infiltrate into Yugoslavia were sent to Cairo, in preparation for the parachute drop. Their main task would be the acts of sabotage on German communication lines and transport of oil, raw materials, troops and war materiel.
The drop.
The Hoathley 1 group was dropped "blind", without a prearranged rendezvous into Eastern Bosnia, near town of Šekovići. The intention was for them to connect with the local population and try and locate the Partisan troops. Previous SOE intelligence suggested that there were resistance fighters in the area. They were lucky, and shortly after landing they were able to join the Partisan Bosnian Corps at the Javornik mountain. On 11 May 1943 their first signal was picked up in Cairo, reporting their safe landing and that they were on the run. They had become a part of a complex and brutal civil war and the war against the invaders. 
The engagement.
Once the Partisan leader, Tito, was informed via radio that the two British missions had arrived, unexpected and uninvited, he instructed the Partisan commanders to look after them and ensure that they did not "undertake some provocation which would compromise the Partisans in the eyes of the international public". This was in response to a previous mission, Operation Hydra, which resulted in death of two British officers most likely at the hand of a royalist chetnik in April/May 1942. For those who claimed Canadian Communist Party membership, Tito consulted the Comintern, who advised caution.
All three members of the group were miners, able to use explosives competently. They also investigated and reported on chetniks' collaboration with the Germans near Zvornik, and the Italians near Višegrad in May 1943. 
Merging into Operation Typical.
One month after the two missions had landed, the first official, and uniformed, SOE/SIS mission was dispatched from the same airport on 27 May 1943. Led by Col Bill Deakin, they joined Tito's HQ and followed him out of the encirclement at Tjentište. Deakin met up with the group in Kladanj on 28 Jun 1943 and merged them into his mission. The enlarged group now had three radio sets and were able to communicate with Cairo with better resilience, as regular schedule had to be kept. This enabled them to organise further military aid drops in the area. 
On 7 Jul 1943, Serdar used recently dropped British plastic explosive to interrupt rail transport of coal, hoping to deprive other trains of fuel and frustrate enemy's troop movements. On 18 Jul 1943 and on 29 Jul 1943, he witnessed and reported on the destruction of parts of the strategic Sarajevo - Višegrad line. On collaboration with the occupiers, they further reported on 29 Jul 1943 that the German command were using chetniks as auxiliaries, for attacks on the Partisans and for guarding the railway near Tuzla. On 15 Aug 1943 they reported that some chetniks were armed with German rifles and supplied by food and pay.

Souk El Kamour

Souk El Kamour (Arabic:سوق الكامور) or the spices market is one of the most important and oldest souks of the medina of Sfax.
Etymology.
The souk got its name probably from its special architecture. Its streets are covered with a barrel vault called "Kamr "in Arabic.
Description.
Backed by the northern facade of the Great Mosque, the souk stretches along an east-west axis, perpendicular to the main wing of the souk Errbaa.
According to some historians, this market was specialized in selling spices and sfaxian natural products (raisins, almonds, pistachios, dried figs etc.).
Nowadays, most of his shops got converted into modern ones where new products that are mainly imported are exposed to the sale (clothes, bags, etc.).

Comber Earlies

Comber Earlies, also called new season Comber potatoes, are potatoes grown around the town of Comber, County Down, Northern Ireland. They enjoy the status of protected geographical indication (PGI) since 2012 and are grown by the Comber Earlies Growers Co-Operative Society Limited.
The term applies to immature potatoes harvested between early May and late July in the area surrounding Comber. This area, sheltered by the Mourne Mountains and Ards Peninsula and protected from frost by the saltwater of Strangford Lough, has a distinctive microclimate, allowing an early potato harvest and a distinctive sweet, nutty flavour. Comber Earlies are not a variety of potato, they can be of many varieties, but are named solely after the location at which they are grown.
History.
Comber potatoes have long been linked with the Ulster Scots planters the Hamiltons and Montgomerys. The first written mention of potatoes being grown in Ireland, in 1606, mentions Comber.

Diuris magnifica

Diuris magnifica, commonly called the large pansy orchid is a species of orchid which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has large, colourful flowers and is common in a narrow range near the coast around Perth, often occurring with the similar but smaller "Diuris corymbosa".
Description.
"Diuris magnifica" is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of . Two or three leaves emerge at the base, each leaf long, wide and folded lengthwise. There are between three and nine golden-yellow and purple flowers long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long and wide and curves upwards. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards and usually crossed. The petals are erect with an egg-shaped blade long and wide on a purplish-brown stalk long. The labellum is mauve or purple with some yellow markings, long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There is a single yellow, ridged callus long in the mid-line of the labellum. The species is similar to several other "Diuris" including "D. corymbosa" and "D. amplissima" but is distinguished from them by its size, flowering period and distribution. Flowering occurs from late August to October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris magnifica" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in a reserve near Kwinana and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet (magnifica) is a Latin word meaning "noble", "eminent" or "splendid" referring to the large, colourful flowers of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
The large pansy orchid is common in near coastal shrubland and woodland between Lancelin and Mandurah in the Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. At the northern end of its distribution, this species hybridises with the as yet undescribed Arrowsmith pansy orchid ("Diuris" sp. 'Eneabba') and in the south with "D. corymbosa".
Conservation.
"Diuris magnifica" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

1985 UK Athletics Championships

The 1985 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Antrim Stadium, Antrim. It was the second time that a national track and field championship was held in Northern Ireland, after hosting the 1981 event.
It was the ninth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1985 AAA Championships.
Fatima Whitbread won her fifth consecutive women's javelin throw UK title. Both the men's and women's champions defended in the 5000 metres (Eamonn Martin, Angela Tooby) and shot put (Billy Cole, Judy Oakes), as did men's hammer thrower Dave Smith. Linford Christie and John Regis recorded the same times in both the 100 metres and 200 metres finals. Christie was given the 100 m title while the two shared the 200 m title. Christie was the only athlete at the competition to win two titles.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1985 European Cup. Three UK champions medalled at that event: Whitbread in the javelin, Angela Tooby in the 10,000 m and Tom McKean in the 800 metres. Derek Redmond was third in the 400 metres at the European competition, despite coming second at the UK race.

TSS Canterbury (1928)

TSS "Canterbury" was a ferry completed in 1929 to link the "Golden Arrow" and "La Flèche d'Or" trains to form the prestige London–Dover–Calais–Paris service.
Construction.
The ship was built as first class only passenger ferry by William Denny &amp; Bros of Dumbarton, Scotland for the Southern Railway.
Service.
The ship entered service simultaneously with the "Golden Arrow" rail service. At this time she was first class only, and while having a capacity of 1700, her projected loadings were expected to be less than 400.
The ship was modified to accommodate two classes of passengers from May 1931, at the same time as third class carriages were introduced on the "Golden Arrow" train.
Following the "Golden Arrow" last trip after the declaration of the Second World War, "Canterbury" was converted to a troop ship. On 29 May 1940 after departing the east pier at Dunkirk at 16:50 with 1960 troops "Canterbury" was badly damaged by a bomb near miss but was able to reach Dover. Following repairs she continued with the evacuation on 3 June 1940 completing five trips for the evacuation. She then performed some sailings from Southampton evacuations to Normandy and Brittany until the middle of June before resting on the River Dart and serving as a target practice ship of the Fleet Air Arm and a period on the Stranraer–Larne route.
From June 1942, she undertook an eight-month conversion to a troop landing ship and took part in the June 1944 Normandy landings.
Postwar, she initially returned to the "Golden Arrow" service, but was replaced in October 1946 by the Southern Railways flagship following that ship's refurbishment. "Canterbury" served on the Folkstone–Calais run, and in 1948 moved to the Calais–Boulogne route until retirement in 1964. In 1948, "Canterbury" became the first English Channel ferry to be equipped with radar.
Fate.
The ship was broken up in 1965.
Preservation.
The ship's bell and a Second World War memorial plaque are held by the National Railway Museum.
In fiction.
In 1951 she made an appearance as the cross-channel ferry in the British comedy film "The Lavender Hill Mob".

Howard Frederick Hobbs

Howard Frederick Hobbs (21 September 1902 – 15 December 1982) was a South Australian inventor, a pioneer of automatic transmission for motor vehicles. In 1932 he moved to England, where he spent the rest of his life developing automatic gearboxes that failed to find a market.
History.
Hobbs was born in Adelaide a son of J(ohn) Harris Hobbs and Mary Eliza Hobbs, née Pitt, of Payneham and studied at Prince Alfred College, where he was successful academically and in athletics. His brothers Norman Theodore Hobbs and ?? were educated at the same school. He left school at age 15, to work on his father's orchard and market garden.
In his spare time, he worked on a series of mechanical inventions. He never underwent higher education and his engineering knowledge and abilities were entirely self-taught.
He married Phyllis Dorothy Reid in 1927; they had a daughter Barbara on 5 May 1927. They lived in Paradise, a suburb of Adelaide, where he spent seven years working on his automatically variable gearbox until he had a working model operating in a "baby Austin" car. His invention won the support of professors R. W. Chapman and Kerr Grant of Adelaide University. A parts breakdown may be viewed here.
A company, Hobbs Gearless Drive Limited, was founded in June 1931 with capital of £12,250 in £1 shares, to exploit the invention. Sidney Crawford of Adelaide Motors, L. M. Anderson, R. Deaves (engineer) of St. Peters, H. F. Hobbs (inventor), and his father J. H. Hobbs were the directors. J. H. Hobbs was company chairman. Other investors were G. H. Scott (factory representative for New Zealand of Austin Motor Car Company, Limited. Wellington), W. G. T. Goodman (engineer), and Adelaide Motors Limited. Both of the Hobbs and R. Deaves also invested in the company.
Hobbs sailed for England with his family to demonstrate the invention to engineers at Coventry. The Hobbs settled in Leamington Spa, and had two more children: John on 1 July 1933 and David on 9 June 1939.
In 1932, after some satisfactory test results, another £50,000 in shares was issued, and Sidney Crawford was elected Managing Director.
No major auto manufacturer ever signed a contract, and the company was wound up in 1941.
Hobbs persisted, and founded Hobbs Transmissions Ltd. at Leamington Spa in 1946. In 1950 he produced a hydraulically operated four-speed "Mechamatic" gearbox, which was lighter and more compact than the American models, and found a few buyers.
A later company was Variable Kinetic Drives, Ltd., which was granted three key patents.
