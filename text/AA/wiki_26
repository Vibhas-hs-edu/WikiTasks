Magic Under Glass

Magic Under Glass is a young-adult fantasy novel by American writer Jaclyn Dolamore. It was published in 2010 by Bloomsbury Publishing, with 240 pages. "Magic Under Glass" and its 2012 sequel "Magic Under Stone" were adapted as a fantasy rock musical in 2017 by the Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts.
Plot summary.
The story takes place in the kingdom of Lorinar that is in an ongoing war with a neighboring fairy kingdom. Nimira, the heroine, is a woman of aristocratic roots who works as a dancer in a foreign land after her mother's death and the disappearance of her father. She does not think twice when a handsome and mysterious magician, Hollin Parry invites her to live in his palace on the condition that she performs with a robot that can only be turned on with a silver key. She soon finds out that there is some evil magic in the mist and that the automation is Erris, a cursed fairy prince who is trapped in a robot body. Hollin's wife Annalie is trapped in an attic under the control of a sorcerer. Nimira and Erris fall in love and help to free Annalie from her curse. It is unknown what fate awaits them as they seek to free Erris from his automaton body.
The sequel, "Magic Under Stone", continues the tale of this duo in this magical land of twists and turns.
Background.
Dolamore's inspiration for "Magic Under Glass" came from her interest in the Victorian era and automaton. Due, in part, to the influence of her favorite author Charlotte Brontë, Dolamore wanted to write a story that incorporated gothic and romance themes. It took her two months to write the first draft of the novel, which she then rewrote twice over the next two years.
Reception.
"Magic Under Glass", was met by generally positive reviews. Its publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing faced criticism due to perceived whitewashing by using a white woman on the cover to depict the heroine, Nimira who is described in the book as "black-haired and brown-skinned." The author, Dolamore wrote that, although the plot is set in an imaginary kingdom, Nimira's character draws from Eastern European, Asian and Roma cultures.
Adaptations.
Columbia Center for Theatrical Arts announced its intention to stage a musical adaptation of "Magic Under Glass" and "Magic Under Stone", engaging author Dolamore as playwright, Michael Kline as composer and lyricist, Toby Orenstein as artistic director, and Ross Scott Rawlings as orchestrator and music director. Dolamore began writing the script in the Summer of 2015 and concluded it, with the assistance of Kline and Orenstein that December. The musical opened at Howard County Community College Smith Theater in Columbia, Maryland in July 2017. The costume designer, Kristen Clark exhibited the musical at the 2017 World Stage Design in Taipei, Taiwan. In November 2017, American Latino TV featured the musical in an episode, interviewing cast members and hosting a live performance of selections from the original score.

Giuseppe Federico Palombini

Giuseppe Federico Palombini or Joseph Friedrich von Palombini (3 December 1774 – 25 April 1850) became an Italian division commander during the Napoleonic Wars. He joined the army of the Cispadane Republic in 1796 and fought at Faenza in 1797. He became commander of a dragoon regiment in 1798. He became commander of the "Napoleone" Dragoons, of the Cisalpine Republic army, in 1802. He fought as an ally of the French at Kolberg and Stralsund in 1807. He married the daughter of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski (Dombrowski) in 1806.
Transferred to Spain, he fought in Domenico Pino's division at Roses, Cardadeu, Molins de Rei, Valls and Gerona and was promoted general of brigade in 1809. He led a brigade at El Pla and Tarragona in 1811 and was promoted general of division. He led his division at Saguntum, Valencia and Castro Urdiales in 1811–1813. Transferring to Italy, he fought at Cerknica in 1813 and Peschiera del Garda in 1814. After collapse of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1814, he joined the army of the Austrian Empire, becoming a Feldmarschall-Leutnant. He became the Inhaber (proprietor) of the 36th Line Infantry Regiment in 1817. He retired in 1824 and died in 1850 at his wife's castle in Grochwitz near Herzberg (Elster).
Early career.
On 3 December 1774, Palombini was born in Rome of parents Pietro Palombini and Teresa Spada. He studied drawing in school. On 1 November 1796 or a few days earlier he enlisted in the 5th Cohort of the army of the Cispadane Republic. He was promoted sergeant major on 7 November and second lieutenant on 21 December 1796. His first action occurred on 2 February 1797 at the Battle of Faenza while fighting against troops of the Papal States. He became first lieutenant on 10 May and captain assistant major on 25 May 1798. He resigned from the army of the Cisalpine Republic (successor state to the Cispadane Republic) on 9 September 1798 to take a commission as colonel of the gendarmes of the Roman Republic. In November the same year, Palombini's regiment was converted to dragoons. The unit was involved in operations near Fano on 11 July 1799.
Palombini was at the Siege of Ancona which lasted from 14 October to 13 November 1799. The French garrison was surrounded by an 8,000-strong Austrian corps and blockaded by a joint Russian-Ottoman fleet. The garrison surrendered to the Austrians and were paroled to France on condition to not fight against Austria until exchanged. Palombini was wounded in the shoulder on 2 November while repelling an enemy attack. The French commander Jean-Charles Monnier recommended him for promotion to general of brigade, but it was never approved. After Ancona, Giuseppe Lechi sent Palombini to Bourg-en-Bresse to organize a battalion of the Italic Legion. After the truce following the Battle of Marengo in June 1800, Lechi named him president of the audit board of his division. In October, Palombini led a 170-man Roman battalion in Domenico Pino's division during the invasion of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. This ended with the capture of Siena after a clash on 14 January 1801, during which he led Pino's advance guard.
Palombini returned to Milan the end of the War of the Second Coalition to find there was no post in the Cisalpine army for him. Despite recommendations from Lechi and Pino, his request to be named general of brigade was rejected by the government. The Minister of War Giovanni Tordorò found him an administrative position in November 1801. He was appointed commander of a battalion of the 1st Light Infantry Regiment on 2 November 1802.
Napoleonic Italy.
Northern Europe.
Palombini became "chief of brigade" (colonel) of the 2nd Hussar Regiment on 23 February 1804 and went to command the unit at the Camp of Boulogne. This regiment later became the "Napoleone" Dragoons. On 28 August 1806 he married Carolina Amalia Beatrice Dąbrowski, the daughter of the Polish general Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. He was appointed a knight of the Order of the Iron Crown in 1806, and at a later date, a commander of the order. He was part of the Italian contingent sent to Germany to fight in the War of the Fourth Coalition. The "Napoleone" and "Regina" Dragoons fought at the Siege of Kolberg which lasted from 20 March to 2 July 1807. The commander of the Italian division, Pietro Teulié was killed during the unsuccessful siege. In July, the division marched to participate in the Siege of Stralsund which had begun on 15 January 1807. With the division under Pino's leadership, the two dragoon regiments joined the besieging force until 20 August when the Swedes evacuated Stralsund.
Peninsular War: 1808–1809.
In 1808, Palombini went to fight in Spain with Pino's division and stayed there until 1813. After Guillaume Philibert Duhesme's Imperial French army abandoned the Second Siege of Gerona in mid-August 1808, it was clear to Emperor Napoleon that he needed to send more troops to Catalonia. Unlike previous reinforcements, which were "mere sweepings of his depots", first class formations were sent. These were Joseph Souham's French division and Pino's Italian division. Pino's 5th Division comprised three battalions each of the Italian 1st Light, 2nd Light, and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the 4th Line, and one battalion each of the 5th and 7th Line. Jacques Fontane's Italian cavalry brigade consisted of the Royal Chasseurs and 7th Dragoons ("Napoleone"). The French emperor placed all Imperial troops in Catalonia in the VII Corps under Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr.
The Siege of Roses lasted from 7 November to 5 December 1808 and ended with the surrender of the Spanish garrison. The divisions of Honoré Charles Reille and Pino were employed in the besieging force while the divisions of Souham and Louis François Jean Chabot formed the covering force. The cavalry were not mentioned. Pino's division reported 30 officers and 400 men killed and wounded. After the fall of Roses, Saint-Cyr boldly resolved to march to the relief of Barcelona. He took the divisions of Pino, Souham and Chabot, leaving Reille behind. Since he planned to take his 15,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry across the hills on footpaths, Saint-Cyr took no artillery pieces and only what food and extra ammunition could be carried on mules.
On 16 December 1808 the Battle of Cardadeu (Llinas) was fought. Finding 9,000 Spanish troops under Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu blocking his path, Saint-Cyr left Chabot's small division to guard his rear and planned to hurl 13,000 troops from Pino's and Souham's divisions at his foes. Saint-Cyr insisted that the assault be carried out in a massed column with Pino's division in the lead. However, Pino disobeyed orders and deployed the seven battalions of his leading brigade. The initial attack drove back the first Spanish line but was repulsed by the second line. In this crisis, Saint-Cyr directed Souham's division to angle to the left and ordered Pino's second brigade forward, six battalions strong. As the Spanish defenders began to give way before the two columns, the French commander ordered the two Italian cavalry regiments to charge the Spanish center. Vives' lines crumpled and his troops took to their heels. Saint-Cyr's corps sustained 600 casualties while inflicting 1,000 killed and wounded on the Spanish and capturing 1,500 men and five cannons.
With Barcelona relieved, the Spanish army fell back behind the Llobregat River. Since Vives was separated from his army after Cardadeu, Theodor von Reding commanded the Spanish troops. The Battle of Molins de Rei was fought on 21 December 1808. Saint-Cyr ordered Joseph Chabran's French division to make a false attack on the Spanish left flank. Completely fooled, Reding reinforced his left from his right flank. Saint-Cyr then sent Souham, Pino and Chabot against the weakened right flank and rolled up the Spanish line. The Imperial troops rounded up 1,200 Spanish prisoners and captured 25 artillery pieces. Palombini was promoted general of brigade on 14 February 1809.
After Molins de Rei, Reding was reinforced and his army recovered its confidence; he decided to take the field. After a series of maneuvers, Reding decided to return to his base at Tarragona. Hearing of this move, Saint-Cyr blocked both roads that his adversary might use, establishing Souham's division at Valls and Pino's at Pla d'Urgell. After a night march, Reding's army appeared before Souham's division on the morning of 25 February and the Battle of Valls began. During the morning, Reding's superior numbers forced Souham back and the Spanish army had a clear road to Tarragona. At noon, Saint-Cyr arrived in person with the two Italian cavalry regiments. Thinking that the Imperials were heavily reinforced, Reding pulled his tired soldiers back to high ground behind the Francolí River. Because of a muddle in orders, Pino's division did not come on the field until after 4:00 pm. At that hour Saint-Cyr arranged the two divisions in four columns of a brigade each, with the Italian cavalry between the center columns and the French 24th Dragoons on the right flank. Reding's soldiers fired a great volley at range, but when the Imperials were seen advancing through the smoke, the Spanish lines disintegrated. For the loss of 1,000 men, the Imperials inflicted 3,000 casualties on their foes and seized their wagon train and all their artillery. Reding was mortally wounded by French dragoons.
The Third Siege of Gerona lasted from 6 June to 10 December 1809. One authority wrote that the Spanish garrison lost 5,122 men killed and 4,248 captured, while Imperial fatalities numbered 15,000, half from disease. Jean-Antoine Verdier led 14,000 soldiers of the siege force in the divisions of Lechi, Verdier and Annet Morio de L'Isle while Saint-Cyr commanded 14,000 troops covering the siege. Palombini commanded a 912-man cavalry brigade in Pino's Division, which was part of Saint-Cyr's covering army. On 1 June 1809, the brigade included six squadrons belonging to the Italian Horse Chasseur and Dragoon Regiments. On 10 July, a Spanish relieving column was ambushed and destroyed by Pino's division, losing 40 officers and 878 men captured. The Spanish garrison of Gerona defeated a major Imperial attack on 19 September. After that fiasco, the 1,000 survivors of Lechi's division were incorporated into Pino's division and Saint-Cyr determined to starve out the garrison rather than waste any more lives in futile assaults. Pino's division defeated a relieving column on 26 September and captured its food convoy. On 7 November, Pino's division raided and burned the large Spanish supply dump at Hostalric.
Peninsular War: 1810–1811.
On 15 January 1810, the VII Corps was under the command of Marshal Pierre Augereau. At that date, Pino's division had 238 officers and 6,346 men present under arms, 201 detached, 2,409 sick in hospital and 93 prisoners. With the divisions of Pino and Souham, Augereau made an expedition in January in which all captured miquelets (militiamen) were hanged. In retaliation, the Spanish began killing all Imperial soldiers that they caught. By 15 March Filippo Severoli had assumed command of the Italian division when Pino went home on leave. On 24 April, Napoleon replaced Augereau with Marshal Jacques MacDonald. The new commander rescinded Augereau's orders to kill captured guerillas. MacDonald used Severoli's division to guard large convoys to Barcelona in June, July and August. In 1810, Palombini was appointed an officer of the Legion of Honor.
On 2 January 1811, Louis Gabriel Suchet's III Corps successfully concluded the Siege of Tortosa. No longer needed as a covering force, MacDonald with 12,000 men started back to Lleida (Lérida) by a roundabout march past Tarragona. The Italian division was leading, followed at a distance of by three French brigades and one regiment of cavalry. When Francesco Orsatelli (called Eugenio) detected Pedro Sarsfield's Spanish division nearby, he recklessly attacked with his 2,500 foot soldiers and 30 horsemen. In the Battle of El Pla, Sarsfield's 3,000 infantry and 800 cavalry drove back the vanguard Italian brigade. Eugenio's men rallied when Palombini's brigade reached the field. Utilizing his superior numbers of cavalry, Sarsfield turned Palombini's right flank and broke his lines. The day might have ended in a disaster but Jacques-Antoine-Adrien Delort appeared with the 24th Dragoons and checked the victorious Spaniards. The Italians lost 600 men, including Eugenio fatally wounded, while Spanish casualties numbered only 160.
On 10 March 1811, Napoleon transferred a large part of the VII Corps to the III Corps under Louis Gabriel Suchet. At that time the Italian division became part of Suchet's command. During the Siege of Tarragona, the two Italian brigades served in a composite division under Jean Isidore Harispe. They covered the siege lines on the east side. At 7:00 pm on 21 June 1811, Palombini led the storming columns against the lower city. The assault force, which was made up of 1,500 grenadiers and voltigeurs from the French regiments plus a French brigade, was successful and the lower city was seized. Imperial casualties were 120 killed and 362 wounded. During the final assault on 28 June, Juan de Courten and 3,000 Spanish troops tried to escape from the east side of Tarragona, but were blocked by the Italians. Some escaped to the Royal Navy warships offshore, a handful scattered into the hills, many others were cut down by Imperial cavalry on the beach, but most were captured.
On 11 July 1811, Palombini was promoted general of division. That year, Napoleon raised him to the dignity of Baron of the Empire. On 15 July 1811, the III Corps was renamed the Army of Aragon with Luigi Gaspare Peyri in command of the Italian division. Pino's old division was still made up of the 1st and 2nd Light and the 4th, 5th and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, plus the Chasseurs and the "Napoleone" Dragoons. Palombini led a column through Caldes de Montbui and Sant Feliu de Codines to join Suchet's main column at Centelles. After the Battle of Montserrat on 25 July, Suchet installed Palombini's brigade as a garrison for the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey which previously functioned as a Catalan supply base.
Suchet launched the invasion of Valencia Province with 22,000 soldiers in three French divisions under Harispe, Louis François Félix Musnier and Pierre-Joseph Habert, Palombini's Italian division, a weak brigade of Neapolitans, cavalry and artillery. Palombini's 6,219-man division included Vertigier Saint Paul's brigade, the 2nd Light Infantry (2,200) and 4th Line (1,660), and Éloi Charles Balathier's brigade, 5th Line (930) and 6th Line (1,429). On 15 September 1811, Suchet's army advanced in three columns, the center one under Palombini consisted of his own division and 1,500 Neapolitans. On 19 September, Palombini's troops joined Suchet's coastal column without incident. On 28 September an unsuccessful assault was made on Sagunto Castle in which 52 Italians became casualties. Two days later, Palombini's troops drove a Spanish division away from Segorbe. On 20 October, Palombini with one French and one Italian brigade again raided Segorbe and quickly returned by the 24th.
The Battle of Saguntum took place on 25 October 1811. Spanish commander Joaquín Blake attacked with 17,000 men in his left wing and 10,500 in his right wing, but his best troops were on the right. Suchet maintained the siege of Sagunto Castle with 4,000 troops including Balathier's brigade. The French commander faced Blake with 14,000 troops; Saint Paul's brigade and the cavalry were in reserve. Suchet's 4,500-man right wing under Józef Chłopicki completely routed Blake's left wing with the help of Colonel Schiazetti's "Napoleone" Dragoons. Blake's right wing troops put up a good fight and 1,100 Spanish cavalry drove off three French squadrons in the center. In this crisis, Suchet ordered the 13th Cuirassiers to charge and ordered Palombini to commit the reserve infantry brigade. The cuirassiers routed most of the Spanish horsemen and rode down a Spanish battery. Saint Paul's brigade drove off the remaining enemy cavalry and crashed into the exposed flank of a Spanish infantry division, forcing it into retreat. According to historian Charles Oman, Saint Paul's attack was the decisive stroke that won the battle.
Blake posted his 23,000-man army behind the Turia River protecting Valencia. On 26 December 1811, Suchet advanced with 30,000 troops, sending Habert against the Spanish right flank and Palombini against the Spanish left center near Mislata. But the main attack looped around Blake's extreme left flank at Riba-roja de Túria. Palombini mounted a serious attack on the Spanish entrenchments and his soldiers suffered significant losses. Blake became convinced that Palombini was the most dangerous threat. Meanwhile, Suchet's main attack rolled up Blake's left with very little opposition. Most of the Spanish left flank units fled to the south. By the late afternoon, Harispe on Suchet's right flank joined hands with Habert on the left, trapping Blake and 17,000 Spanish soldiers within Valencia. Palombini's division lost 50 killed and 355 wounded, which accounted for the bulk of Suchet's 521 casualties during the operation. The Siege of Valencia ended on 9 January 1812 when Blake surrendered. On 31 December, Palombini's division counted 3,591 officers and men.
Peninsular War: 1812–1813.
Following orders from Napoleon, Palombini's division began marching to southern Aragon on 15 February 1812. The division was soon assigned, together with two other divisions to a corps under Reille. Palombini began sending out small anti-guerilla columns around Teruel, but on 5 and 28 March his troops suffered defeats. Having learned not to risk small forces, he massed his troops, but was unable to stop the guerillas from operating. Early in July, King Joseph Bonaparte tried to assemble a force to help Marshal Auguste de Marmont's army. He ordered Palombini to march to Madrid and the Italian promptly did so, even though Suchet was his immediate superior. After a forced march of , Palombini's division arrived at Madrid exactly on the day predicted. Unfortunately for Joseph, it was too late; Marmont was badly defeated in the Battle of Salamanca on 25 July. Palombini's troops were in support of Anne-François-Charles Trelliard's cavalry on 11 August during the Battle of Majadahonda. On 15 October 1812, Palombini's division numbered 142 officers and 3,050 men, divided between the 2nd Light, 4th Line and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, plus the "Napoleone" Dragoons and two artillery batteries.
By an edict of 4 January 1813, many Imperial regiments in Spain were ordered to send home cadres enough to form one battalion. Most of the rank and file were transferred to the remaining field battalions. Palombini's division had to send back three battalion cadres. That month Palombini's division marched to join the Army of the North in order to replace a Young Guard brigade that was recalled to France. Palombini set up headquarters in Poza de la Sal and sent out foraging columns to find food. On the night of 10–11 February, Spanish troops under Francisco de Longa surprised the 500 Italians in the town. Rallying his men, Palombini held out until morning when his outlying columns returned and Longa's men slipped away. The Italian division reached Bilbao where they relieved the Young Guard on 21 February. From 25 January to 13 February, Palombini's division successfully cleared the highway between Burgos and Vitoria-Gasteiz. On 24 March near Castro Urdiales, Gabriel de Mendizábal Iraeta's 3,000–4,000 Spanish troops tried to surround Palombini's division, but were driven off. The Italians admitted sustaining 110 casualties but the real number was probably higher. The Italian division then brought supplies to the blockaded French garrison of Santoña. From there, Palombini's troops marched first to Bilbao then to Guernica where they unsuccessfully attacked a Spanish force on 2 April. After picking up some reinforcements, Palombini attacked Guernica on 5 April and this time drove off the Spanish.
On 10 April 1813, the Spanish attacked Bilbao. Its 2,000-man garrison barely held out until Palombini's division marched to the rescue. After a futile pursuit of the guerillas, the Italian division returned to Bilbao to wait for reinforcements. On 25 April, Maximilien Sébastien Foy set out with 11,000 soldiers including his own, Jacques Thomas Sarrut's and Palombini's divisions. By this time the Italian division had shrunk to 2,474 men in five battalions. Foy laid siege to Castro Urdiales, using his own division and three Italian battalions for the siege force. With the help of heavy cannons from Santoña, a gap of was blasted in the wall. In the evening of 11 May, eight Italian elite companies attacked the city gate while eight French elite companies assaulted the breach. Both rushes were successful, but the Royal Navy rescued most of the Spanish garrison while Foy's soldiers were plundering the city. Shortly afterward, Palombini was recalled to Italy. The division, reduced to a 1,500-man brigade, was led by Saint Paul during a short campaign that included the Battle of Tolosa on 26 June.
Italy: 1813–1814.
Palombini was given command of the 5th Italian Division under Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais. On 7 September 1813, Gillot Rougier's (Ruggeri) 2,563-strong brigade from the 5th Division was defeated at Lipa in Croatia by a 2,100-man Austrian brigade under Laval Nugent von Westmeath. On 14 September at Jelšane, under the overall command of Pino, Palombini's division attacked Nugent's force but was unable to dislodge it. At nightfall, the Austrians finally retreated, having sustained 112 casualties and three dismounted cannons out of a total of 2,000 men and four guns. The Italians suffered 420 casualties out of 9,000 men and 12 guns, including Pino wounded. On 27 September at Cerknica, Palombini with 5,000 men and seven guns was defeated by Paul von Radivojevich with 4,000 Austrians and nine guns. The 5th Division included one battalion each of the 2nd Light and 1st Line Infantry, four battalions of the 2nd Line, three battalions of the 3rd Line, and two battalions of the Dalmatian Infantry Regiment. The Austrians captured 300 Italians, mostly from the 2nd Light. As a result of these and other actions, Eugène retreated west across the Isonzo River.
On 10 March 1814 there was a series of clashes between Mantua and Peschiera del Garda with Eugène's forces getting the worst of it. The Austrians lost 400 casualties while inflicting 2,000 casualties on the Franco-Italians. At Peschiera, Palombini with 2,000 troops was beaten by 3,000 Austrians, but losses were light on both sides. Palombini's force consisted of two brigades. Rougier's brigade included two battalions of the 3rd Light and four battalions of the 2nd Line. Livio Galimberti's brigade comprised three battalions of the 3rd Line, one battalion of the 6th Line, the Milan Guards Battalion and the "Napoleone" Dragoons. Near the end of the conflict, Palombini withdrew his division within Peschiera's fortress.
Austrian Service.
After the collapse of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, Palombini entered the service of the Austrian Empire. On 2 July 1814 he accepted the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant. In 1815 during the Hundred Days he served on the Rhine against his former French allies. In 1816 received the Order of the Iron Crown, 2nd Class. In 1817 he was appointed Inhaber (proprietor) of the 36th Line Infantry Regiment, a Bohemian unit. The previous inhaber was Karl (Johann) Kollowrat-Krakowski and the succeeding one was Franz Furst zu Colloredo-Mannsfeld in 1850. Palombini retired from active service on 1824. He received the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle, 1st Class in 1846. He died at his wife's castle at Grochowice on 25 April 1850. Carolina had bought the estate in 1821. Their eldest son Giuseppe Camillo Palombini became a captain in the Austrian army.

Sarah Waiswa

Sarah Waiswa is a documentary and portrait photographer born in Uganda and based in Nairobi, Kenya. She won the 2016 Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award for a series that explored albino persecution in sub-Saharan Africa. She was also recognized by the 2015 Uganda Press Photo Awards.
Early life and career.
Sarah Waiswa was born in Uganda and is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She studied sociology and psychology, and is a self-taught photographer.
Her portraiture project, "Stranger in a Familiar Land", explores the persecution of albinos in sub-Saharan Africa, in which they are hunted for the perceived magical powers of their body parts. The series sets an albino woman against a background of the Nairobian slums of Kibera, which represent the stormy outside world. The model's dreamlike pose in societal isolation reflects both the model's alienation and the photographer's hesitance towards her society. Waiswa developed the project to raise awareness after reading a newspaper article about treatment of albinos in Tanzania. Part of their shoot consisted of responding to the jeering throng. Aida Muluneh, the photographer who presented the award, described Waiswa's photography as reflecting her surroundings' complexities. While Sarah Moroz of "i-D" praised the clarity with which Waiswa presented the isolation of albino identity, as the model's lighthearted accessories defied an insurmountable air of rejection, Sean O'Hagan of "The Guardian" considered the otherwise "brave" effort "oddly overstaged".
Waiswa's work explores what she calls a "New African Identity": how younger generations of Africans feel more expressive and less restrained by tradition than their predecessors. She also sought to counteract stereotypical depictions of Africa, often the result of foreign rather than native photographers. Additionally, many of her subjects are women.
In 2016, Waiswa was working with photographer Joel Lukhovi on "African Cityzens", which records daily life in multiple African cities. They participated in a 2017 book that shows the Maasai people in truthful, quotidian context, rather than as stereotypical warriors. For Waiswa, the project consummated a search for information on a poorly documented ancient female deity.

Porfiriia Kiseleva

Matryona Ivanovna Kiseleva (; 1855 — ) was the leader sect of .
In her youth Matryona was a prostitute. Matryona Ivanovna Kiseleva was the spiritual daughter of John of Kronstadt. Kiseleva moved from Kronstadt to Oranienbaum in 1895, where the center of the sect's functioning moved after it, and she formed a community of women who lived under monastic discipline and worshiped at St. Andrew's Cathedral. She also attracted male followers from Saint Andrew's Cathedral of the sect consider Kiseleva a prophetess and called her «Theotokos» (bogoroditsa), , «the porfiriia of the Tsar of Tsars», «Oranienbaum Mother of God». John's sectarians called «Jesus Christ — Tsar of Tsars». Other sectarians had names: Mikhail Petrov (; the «Archangel Michael») is a Yaroslavl peasant, Elizaveta Korchacheva (; «Solomoniia the Myrrh-bearer») is a former prostitute, Nazarii Dmitriev (; «John the Theologian») is a Novgorod peasant, Basilii Pustoshkin (; «Elijah») is landlord Kronstadt Hospice House, (; «Enoch») is a bath attendant.
Porfiriia Kiseleva is glorified by sectarians in special hymns in honor of her, for example:
&lt;poem&gt;«Virgo is wise Porfira,
You suffered for Christ,
You had in oneself 
A high-valued Christ's stone»&lt;/poem&gt;
Ioannites depicted Matryona on icons, and the icons are rendered equal with the sacred images of worship.
Porfiriia confessed to John of Kronstadt. She died of syphilis November 25, 1905. John of Kronstadt performed the funeral of Kiseleva. During the funeral service, instead of the prayers prescribed by the charter, they sang a prayer: «The Most Holy Theotokos, Save us!» The very place of Kisseleva's burial (in Oranienbaum) is the subject of special veneration of the sectarians, the things left after it and sand from the grave are of religious significance for them.
After the death of John of Kronstadt, in 1912 the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church condemned the Ioannites and declared them a sect; Kiseleva was declared a main sectarian. The sect in official documents was named «Khlysts–Kiselevists» from the name of Porfiriia Kiseleva.
The image of Kiseleva found reflection in art. wrote the play «Black Crows» in 1905. The play was a huge success on the stages of theaters and in theaters it was always a full house. In this play, John of Kronstadt was portrayed as a pseudo-healer, and his supporters - «Ioannites», led by Kiseleva, as fanatics-sectarians. The «Ioannites» rise in arms against the play that had exposed them. People's Artist of the USSR , who played in those years in one of the Petersburg troupes, says: "In the «Black Crows», I played the role of a sectarian "Theotokos". Religious fanatics were furious, and often to me, "in order to avoid excesses", I had to return home after the performance, accompanied by guards, who protected me from sectarian attempts to crack down on me when leaving theater".

Kidnapping of Angelo dela Cruz

The Kidnapping of Angelo dela Cruz, a Filipino Overseas Filipino Worker working in Iraq, is an event that led to the withdrawal Filipino soldiers from the Multi-National Force – Iraq, a United States-led multinational coalition which was a participant in the Iraq War.
The kidnapping incident led to the withdrawal of the Philippines from the coalition and a deployment ban for Filipino workers seeking to work in Iraq.
Background.
Situation.
The Philippines was part of the Multi-National Force – Iraq, a United States-led multinational coalition participating in the Iraq War. At that time, there were 51 Filipino soldiers stationed in Iraq while about 4,000 civilians are working in the country, primarily under contract with military bases of the United States. The Philippine government has planned to withdraw its contingent from the coalition by August 2004.
Abductee.
Angelo dela Cruz was an Overseas Filipino Worker or a migrant worker who served as a driver for a Saudi Arabian company before his kidnapping. He was working with the United States Army as part of his job. A native of Pampanga, dela Cruz at the time of his abduction was 46 years old and is a father of three children. Prior to working in Iraq, he worked in Saudi Arabia for 15 years.
Kidnapping.
Angelo dela Cruz was kidnapped near Fallujah while transporting fuel from Saudi Arabia on July 7, 2004 and later appeared in a broadcast by Al Jazeera pleading for his life.
The kidnappers of dela Cruz, identified themselves as members of the Khaled Bin Al-Walid Squadrons which is part of the militant group, Islamic Army of Iraq and demanded the Philippine government to withdraw its 50-person contingent from the United States-led multinational coalition in Iraq "as soon as possible". They demand that the Philippine contingent to be withdrawn from Iraq and that the Philippine government come up with a decision by July 10. The Philippines then confirmed that they will withdraw its contingent on August 20 and claimed that dela Cruz has been released and will be dropped off in a hotel in Baghdad. Al Jazeera reports that the militants have denied such claims.
They set July 13, 2004 as the new deadline for an agreement with the Philippine government. They demand that the Philippine contingent to be withdrawn from Iraq by July 20.
Following a five-hour cabinet meeting on July 12, then-Secretary Delia Albert of the Department of Foreign Affairs said that the Philippine government will not comply with the militants demands. At the day of the deadline, Al Jazeera reported that the militants has taken dela Cruz to a location where his "punishment" will be meted out. Dela Cruz reportedly requested the kidnappers a one-day extension so he could extend a message to the President of the Philippines and that his corpse be delivered to his country's government.
The kidnappers later extended the deadline by 24 hours The Philippine government then agreed to comply with the militants demands. They announced that dela Cruz was released on July 17 though it was only on July 20 that dela Cruz was released by his captors.
Aftermath.
Philippine withdrawal from the coalition.
The Philippine government publicly announced on July 16, 2004, that Philippine contingent will be withdrawn from Iraq "shortly". At the time of the announcement, the Filipino soldiers were already in Kuwait and were scheduled to be flown to Metro Manila by July 19. The government has withdrew its contingent a month earlier than planned.
The move was criticized by the Philippines' allies. Then-Australian Prime Minister John Howard, while remarking that he does not want to be "harsh on a friend", describe the Philippines' move to withdraw its contingent earlier than planned as a "mistake" that would not "buy" the Southeast Asian country "immunity". He acknowledge the crisis resulting from the kidnapping incident as a "wretched state of affairs" and said that giving in to the militant's demands won't stop similar occurrence from happening again.
Iraq and the United States also criticized the move. Then-White House spokesman Scott McClellan also expressed disappointment of the move which he says "sends the wrong signal to terrorists". Gen. John Abizaid of United States Central Command in reaction to the move said that if one "appease terrorism", one "will sooner or later fall victim to it or be taken over by it".
The militant group then issued a web message to the Japanese government to withdraw its 500-person contingent from Iraq as well threatening them with "lines of cars laden with explosives" and urged Japan to "Do what the Philippines has done".
Release of dela Cruz.
After Philippine compliance to the militant groups demands, dela Cruz was released. He was dropped off at the United Arab Emirates embassy in the Mansour district of Baghdad. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo hailed the releasing and dubbed dela Cruz as the "Filipino everyman, a symbol of the hardworking Filipino seeking hope and opportunity" and remarked that she will not regret her government's decision in handling the incident. The United States embassy in Manila congratulated the Philippines for the release without referencing the compliance of the Philippine government to the terms laid by militants.
Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a firm based in the United States, said that the move of Arroyo's administration is to preempt possible backlash from the Overseas Filipino Workers community that identifies themselves with dela Cruz. The firm also said the move was to boost domestic public opinion for Arroyo who just won re-election in the 2004 presidential elections which was marred by controversy.
Iraq worker deployment ban by the Philippines.
Shortly after the return of dela Cruz to the Philippines, the Philippine government issued a deployment ban of Filipino migrant workers to Iraq. The Department of Foreign Affairs then issued passports that explicitly mentions the ban.
Iraq has urged the Philippines to lift its ban so that Filipino workers can be involved in the rehabilitation of the country. The ban was partially lifted in July 2013, allowing Filipinos except domestic workers to work in Iraq though Filipinos were still barred in working in the 
Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, and Salahuddin Governorates.
Post-kidnapping life of dela Cruz.
Then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo provided a new house for Angelo dela Cruz and his family at the Benjamin subdivision in Mexico, Pampanga and his eight children were provided with scholarship by Arroyo. He briefly worked in California, after he was brought in to the United States by his uncle. He returned to the Philippines after he was left bored due to being confined in an office workplace most of the time and found it unsustainable to remain unemployed in the United States. He also received a P200 thousand aid from the OWWA Regional Welfare Administration which he used to buy a jeepney.
Dela Cruz, as of 2011, worked as a passenger van driver plying the Mexico-Angeles City route. As of 2014, he remains as a van driver. He offered services to his neighborhood such as clearing inconsistencies in birth certificate and passport application. He also ran as town councilor at an unspecified date under the Lakas-NUCD party with a platform focusing on the needs of Overseas Filipino Workers but lost.
In 2011, he called for the lifting of ban of deployment of Filipino migrant workers to Iraq.
Angelo Dela Cruz passed away on July 5, 2021 two days prior to the 17th anniversary of his abduction.

Live at Tokyo Dome

Live at Tokyo Dome (stylized in all caps) is the sixth video album by Japanese heavy metal band Babymetal. The album contains footage from the and was released on April 12, 2017 by BMD Fox Records and Toy's Factory. The album features the live performances at Tokyo Dome on September 19 and September 20, 2016, which concluded the band's world tour.
Background.
On December 13, 2015, the band announced a new album, as well as a world tour to begin at Wembley Arena and conclude at Tokyo Dome. Su-metal and Yuimetal expressed the idea of performing at the venue as a dream, promising to work hard to put on a great performance. On April 1, 2016, tickets to the show were made available for purchase to "The One" fanclub members, and later for presale on the band's official website on April 4, 2016. On June 3, 2016, a second day was announced for Tokyo Dome, with tickets for the second show immediately made available to "The One" fanclub members. Both days marked the band's largest venue to date. International fans were able to purchase tickets starting August 27, 2016.
In response to the band playing at the venue, Su-metal commented, "In Japan we have played many big venues like Budokan and others, but Tokyo Dome was always a place that I have been dreaming of performing at. Even in Japan, not everyone gets a chance to perform here!"
Tickets to both shows sold out, with 55,000 people attending the concerts each day. During both shows, the box set "" was made available for general sale. A digest of the shows would later be broadcast by Wowow on December 18, 2016.
"Live at Tokyo Dome" was initially announced on January 23, 2017 as a "The One" exclusive box set release for April 1, 2017, and later on April 12, 2017 in DVD and standard and limited edition Blu-ray formats. A trailer for the video album was released on March 15, 2017, containing concerts denoted as "Red Night" (September 19, 2016) and "Black Night" (September 20, 2016), respectively. The limited edition Blu-ray release came in an analog record-sized jacket, and initial pressings of the video included a Babymetal original sticker sheet.
On April 8, 2020, as part of the band's tenth anniversary, the band released the campaign "Stay Home, Stay Metal" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, streaming the two live performances on April 10 and April 11, 2020, respectively on YouTube.
Development.
Compared to previous tour dates, the set was more decorated, with three tombstone-shaped catwalks connected to the center stage, where stands a tower with big screens attached in a 360˚ ring, and a platform on top of it. Said platform is connected to the stage with an elevator, and can separate into three smaller stages. In addition, the stage included lasers, explosions, pyro, and a periodically rotating center stage. The three band members wore red and black costumes, which were imitated by cosplayers who attended the shows. The audience generally contained a mix of heavy metal fans and Japanese idol fans, who would headbang, sing, or dance to each song.
For the Red Night performance, audience members were all handed crystal neck braces and urged to never take off during the show. After the performance of "Tales of The Destinies", all the neck braces gradually light up as the band transitions to "The One". Reflecting on the performance, Kobametal noted that the development for the shows was done in a little over two weeks, further commenting, "Stage-wise, technical-wise, we had a lot of things we've never done before. Of course we did rehearsals, but until you do it for real you never know how it's going to turn out, or how it's going to look because we didn't have 55,000 people to test on – you're just imagining!"
Content.
The September 19 show, subtitled "Red Night", begins with an introductory video which states that the shows will not perform any song twice, nor will there be any MCs or encores. The narration explains that the crystal neck braces worn will be protection during "the harsh battle ahead", with a decree by the Fox God to not remove them. Red spotlights move around the arena, ending on the band three members who have appeared on stage with Kami Band, as the members hold flags and begin "Road of Resistance". The show mainly focused on songs released from "Metal Resistance". Near the end of the concert, the band performs "Tales of The Destinies" for the first time, which leads to the entire venue going dark. Gradually, the crystal neck braces in the audience start glowing white, which transitions into the final song, the English version of "The One" which begins with the three members walking from the runways off the stage to the center, wearing golden cloaks. At the closing of the show, a video plays to remind the audience of the second show.
The show on September 20, subtitled "Black Night", focuses more on songs released from "Babymetal". A video plays once more to enforce the song-repeating rule. With Kami Band playing on the stage, the three members show up crucified onto crosses on the stage, transitioning into the opener "Babymetal Death". The members walk in sync towards the center stage. During the interlude for "Megitsune", Su-metal yells to the crowd, "Are you ready? Everybody clap your hands!" while Yuimetal and Moametal continue to engage the crowd. When performing "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" the latter two are shown in a smokescreen of carbon dioxide while the crowd headbangs to the bridge of the song. During the final song "Ijime, Dame, Zettai", the crystal neck braces worn glow red, and the song finishes with the three members repeatedly shouting "We are Babymetal!". Then they take the elevator to the top platform where Su-metal rings a gong, thus concluding Episode IV of the Metal Resistance. A final video plays, informing the audience of the band's next objective.
Critical reception.
Frédéric Leclercq positively reviewed the shows, which had been sold out, describing the production as "incredible" while describing the "tombstone-shaped catwalks" and screen-filled tower on the stage. The shows were described as "90 minutes of crazy lasers, explosions, pyro, the circular centre stage rotating from time to time", while the performance of Kami Band was called "flawless". Sue Williamson of "Teen Vogue" described the shows as "sensory overload in its most kawaii form", highlighting the band's "perfectly coordinated choreography, video elements, and totally unique sound".
Commercial performance.
"Live at Tokyo Dome" charted at number three on the Oricon DVD chart and number one on the Oricon Blu-ray chart for the week April 24, 2017, with first-week sales of 11,000 and 26,000 copies, respectively. The latter giving the band's third number one Blu-ray release and making them the female act with the fourth-most number ones on the chart, along with Nana Mizuki and AKB48, and behind Perfume, Namie Amuro and Nogizaka46. The video release also topped the charts for the DVD and Blu-ray music video charts, accumulating sales of 37,000 copies, and becoming the band's fourth consecutive release to top the latter chart.

Dyson Carter

Herbert Dyson Carter (February 2, 1910 – 1996), known as Dyson Carter, was a Canadian scientist, lecturer, writer, and Communist propagandist and organiser who served as president of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society from 1949 to 1960.
During his fifty-year writing career, Carter produced hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles, dozens of short stories, and 17 books including five novels. Many of his non-fiction books and articles popularized scientific ideas and discoveries or reported on medical advances. In the 1930s and 1940s, many of his articles appeared in popular magazines in Canada and the United States and three of his books were published by large commercial publishers in the United States and widely reviewed.
He occasionally used the pseudonym Warren Desmond for popular fiction that he would otherwise would not have been able to sell in the United States due to McCarthyism.
Early life.
Carter was born in Saint John, New Brunswick to Gertrude and William R. Carter, members of the Salvation Army who had been sent from Britain first to Bermuda and then to Canada to work for the church. In 1912, the Carters became matron and superintendent, respectively, of the Provincial Detention Home for Juveniles in Winnipeg, where Dyson Carter would grow up and go to school. Carter suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, which made his bones brittle throughout his life and often required him to be bedridden or walk with crutches, or later use a wheelchair.
Education.
Carter received his Bachelor of Science in 1931 and his Master of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Manitoba in 1933 and subsequently worked as a university lecturer, a researcher and an engineering consultant in addition to his writing career.
Literary career.
Carter wrote in a number of genres including popular science, health, socialist realist fiction, romance, and biography.
His works included "Sea of Destiny: the Story of Hudson Bay, Our Undefended Back Door" (1940), a book that argued the Canadian north was susceptible to Nazi invasion and should be developed and militarized along the lines of the Soviet north in order to prevent such an eventuality, "Night of Flame" (1942), a novel set in a hospital that explored themes of class conflict, and "Stalin's Life" (1943), a hagiographical biography of Stalin.
In the 1930s and 1940s, Carter's articles were published in popular magazines such as "Saturday Night", "Star Weekly", and "Maclean's" and in various American publications such as the pulp magazine "Argosy". 
He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society in 1941, but was essentially blacklisted by the popular media after 1945 when he made public his membership in the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party of Canada was known at the time). He had joined the Communist Party in 1931 but had kept his membership secret for over a decade.
Many of his books were translated into Russian and other languages and distributed throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, and many of his articles were translated and carried in Soviet publications.
Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society and "Northern Neighbors".
As well as being president of the CSFSS from 1949 to 1960, with Dorise Nielsen as executive secretary, and engaging in national lecture tours to promote friendship with the Soviet Union, Carter was editor and publisher of the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society's newsletter, " News-Facts About the USSR" from 1950 to 1956 and of the glossy pro-Soviet magazine "Northern Neighbours" from 1956 to 1989.
Carter's pro-Soviet writings never deviated from the party line, following its twists and turns. The invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 were presented from the Soviet point of view. According to historian Jennifer Anderson, who researched Carter's life and work:
"Dyson Carter eventually recognized the message did not correspond with reality, but not until Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost had made speaking openly about Soviet 'falsifications' possible. In 1990, Carter wrote that he had spent 40 years producing 'bullshit.'"
Carter added: "I publicized so many Soviet 'achievements' that were total falsifications, that I consider my 'work' an exercise in political pathology."
He was awarded several honours by the Soviet Union including the Centenary Medal (1970), the Order of Friendship of the Peoples (1980) and the Order of the Union of Friendship Societies (1985).

Sodium 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate

Sodium 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate is the organosulfur compound with the formula Na2C3S5, abbreviated Na2dmit. It is the sodium salt of the conjugate base of the 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiol. The salt is a precursor to dithiolene complexes and tetrathiafulvalenes.
Reduction of carbon disulfide with sodium affords sodium 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate together with sodium trithiocarbonate:
Before the characterization of dmit2-, reduction of CS2 was thought to give tetrathiooxalate (Na2C2S4).
The dianion C3S52- is purified as the tetraethylammonium salt of the zincate complex [Zn(C3S5)2]2-. This salt converts to the bis(thioester) upon treatment with benzoyl chloride:
Cleavage of the thioester with sodium methoxide gives sodium 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate:
Na2dmit undergoes S-alkylation. Heating solutions of Na2dmit gives the isomeric 1,2-dithioledithiolate.

Lexie Liu

Lexie Liu, also known as Liu Boxin (; born December 21, 1998), is a Chinese singer, rapper and songwriter.
In 2015, she participated in "K-pop Star 5", a South Korean reality TV competition series where her group came in fourth place. In July 2018, she participated in "The Rap of China" and won fourth place, which launched her career as a solo artist. In February 2019, Liu released her debut EP "2030" in the United States with eight singles including "Outta Time" featuring Killy, "Love and Run", "Hat Trick", and "Nada".
She also participated in the song of "K/DA" "MORE" as Seraphine's voice.
Early life.
Liu was born and raised in Changsha, Hunan. She has been interested in music since she was young; she started to dance when she was four years old and learned to play the piano starting at six years old. When Liu was in grade eleven, she transferred to an international high school. However, she took a gap year when she was in grade twelve to make music. She went to Korea and participated in the reality TV competition series, "K-pop Star 5", under her birth name Liu Yuyu, as a member of a 4-person girl group named "Mazinga S" which won fourth place.
While shooting the TV show, "K-pop Star 5", Liu applied and was accepted to Fordham University to study global business. However, she later left to pursue her music career.
Career.
2016–present: Indie career, "2030", "Meta Ego", and "GONE GOLD".
In January 2017, Liu's first original single "Coco Made Me Do It" was released and achieved more than 5 million views. In February 2017, she performed at SXSW music festival, one of the largest music festivals in the world, bringing Chinese Pop music to the US audience.
In January 2018, she composed a song called "Role" for Li Yifeng, a Chinese popular idol, singer, and actor.
In July 2018, Liu participated in "The Rap of China", entered the final round with a song "Mulan," and eventually won fourth place. While competing in "The Rap of China", Liu signed with American label 88rising.
In November, she released her new song "Sleep Away" from her upcoming debut EP "2030" which was previously released in China. The Fader named the track as one of “10 Songs You Need in Your Life”, Nylon listed it as the “Best Music Releases Of The Week", and Refinery29 said “their ears are very into Lexie.”
On 18 December 2018, Liu released her new cyberpunk-influenced single "Nada", complete with futuristic-themed music video. "The Line of Best Fit" described "Nada" as it "sees Lexie Liu's fierce, cross-cultural grit thrust into a science fiction dimension where language barriers don't exist, She fuses Mandopop with grimy beats against the visuals of her accompanying Tron-esque video, directed by mamesjao, in a retro-futuristic digital world." "Nada" also made its appearance on "Best Of the Week" by Apple Music once it came out.
In February 2019, Liu released her debut EP "2030" in the United States, which included two new singles "Outta Time" featuring Killy and "Love and Run".
In September 2019 her single "Ok, Ok, Ok" was released.
On December 27, 2019, her album "Meta Ego" was released.
On October 28, 2020, Liu voiced the champion Seraphine in Riot Games' virtual K-pop group, K/DA, in their new song "More" from their extended play "All Out". Liu also performed on stage at the 2020 "League of Legends" World Championship in Shanghai.
On January 28, 2021, Liu released her second EP "GONE GOLD" internationally (released as "Online 上线了" in China), featuring her then-newest single "ALGTR" which was self-written and self-produced alongside the rest of the EP. It marked yet another change in sound direction, with the EP taking in significantly more electro-pop influences compared to previous efforts. The project's contemporary theme, reflected in the title track's music videos and the rest of the track list's visualisers which were directed by frequent collaborator Jeremy Z. Qin, revolves around the idea of living in an online game as a character. It was inspired by the unrest experienced throughout 2020 as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, where Liu's only source of understanding the world was solely through a screen - leading her to imagine what life would be like without this source.
Public image.
Lexie Liu's distinct appearance caught the attention of the fashion industry where she landed placements in Paris Fashion Week 2019 as the brand ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent eyewear in the Asia Pacific Region, Louis Vuitton Show 2018 in China, Puma's Suede 50 campaign and Levi's New Years TVC campaign.
Lexie Liu has also been featured on the print pages of East Asia's most prominent fashion publications, including Vogue me (China), BAZAAR China, Nylon Japan, and Nylon China.
The American fashion magazine "V" described her as "the face of a generation of new Chinese artists breaking into the American mainstream with a uniquely, cross-cultural sound."
"Lexie Liu proves her status as China’s next global superstar with the futuristic 'Nada'," described by The Line of Best Fit, "born and raised in Changsha, China, 19-year-old Lexie Liu's "Nada' is her third single release after signing to 88rising." "Lexie Liu is spearheading the new generation of East Asian artists making waves in the global music industry. She became the youngest Chinese artist to ever perform at SXSW last year after rising to fame on South Korean TV show 'K-pop Star' and finishing fourth on the heavily male-dominated rap talent show 'The Rap of China'".
After the release of her single "Like A Mercedes", the cyberpunk-inspired music video of the song was Lexie Liu's first introduction to a global audience, showing off how "her provocative sound is transcending language barriers."
Her debut EP released in February 2019 was highly recommended, "with a feature from Killy on Outta Time, plus new singles Sleep Away, Hat Trick and Nada, the eight-tracker is an impressive bilingual project showcasing the Changsha born and raised artist’s skills across rap, R&amp;B vocals and production."
American fashion and culture magazine "Flaunt" also made a praising comment on Lexie's debut EP "2030", which is said to "narrates her life and journey within music; manifesting her inner-psyche through dream-like vocals and vibrant musical films. Dynamic in all aspects, Lexie holds a promising trajectory in the years to come."

The lateral sepals are much shorter and narrower than the dorsal sepal and curve downwards. The petals are shorter than the lateral sepals and are mostly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, up to long and curves downwards to be more or less parallel to the ovary. Flowering occurs from December to March.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis oligantha" was first formally described in 1968 by Lucy Moore from a specimen collected on the edge of Lake Roundabout east of Ashburton and the description was published in the "New Zealand Journal of Botany". The specific epithet ("oligantha") is derived from the Ancient Greek words "oligos" meaning "few", "little" or "scanty" and "anthos" meaning "flower".

Mike Bocchetti

Mike Bocchetti (born April 3, 1961) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and writer from Staten Island, New York. He is most notable for his role as the announcer on "The Artie Lange Show" from 2012 to 2014, and has acted frequently on film and television.
Bocchetti released a comedy album, "Thank You", on Stand Up! Records in 2019.
Early life.
Bocchetti was born on April 3, 1961 in Staten Island to a Catholic Italian family of what he once called "a very humble blue-collar background". He is the oldest of five children. He graduated from Tottenville High School in 1979. Often bullied as a child for being overweight, he was inspired to become a comedian after hearing Redd Foxx and realizing that the audience was laughing with, not at, Foxx.
He joined the Marines in 1980 but washed out after a few weeks; he wrote about the experience for his 2019 stage show "Space Cookie".
Career.
Stand-up comedy/stage.
Bocchetti started performing comedy in 1992 and has performed on New York-area stages for decades, including the Staten Island Comedy Festival and New Jersey music festival The Bamboozle.
Television, radio, and podcasts.
Bocchetti was the announcer on DirectTV's "The Artie Lange Show" (originally titled "The Nick &amp; Artie Show") from 2012 to 2014. He had been friends with Lange since the 1990s as a fellow stand-up comic; before they were famous, Lange once told Bocchetti, "If I'm ever on TV as a talk show host, you are my Ed McMahon." He has worked with Lange often after the show's cancellation.
Bocchetti's television work includes appearances on two seasons of NBC's "Last Comic Standing" in 2003 and 2006. He played a homeless man in the 2004 "Monk" episode "Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan". He appeared on the Louis C.K. series "Louie" in 2015. He was a guest on 25 episodes of Mary Dimino's New York-area cable-TV series "Nights With Mary" between 2003 and 2012.
He is a frequent guest on talk-radio shows and podcasts including "The Howard Stern Show" and "Opie and Anthony", as well as "The Jim Breuer Show", "The Chip Chipperson Podcast", "The Anthony Cumia Show", and "The Slant".
In 2009, Bocchetti starred in a short documentary directed by Lee Schloss, "Who Is Mike Bocchetti?", covering his career and work with Lange, and including interviews with comedians including Colin Quinn.
He formed a production company with comedian Ken Burmeister, Blasted Films, which made "Tubby Man: Hero of the Bullied", a semi-autobiographical comedy web series with an anti-bullying message, for Blip TV in 2013.
In 2014, Bocchetti started his own podcast, "The Mike Bocchetti Show", which ran for 13 episodes.
In December 2019, he began co-hosting a new podcast with Lange, "Artie Lange's Halfway House". Lange suspended the podcast in February 2020.
Film.
In 2002, Bocchetti played one of the Grand Masters of the Illuminati in avant-garde artist Matthew Barney's film "Cremaster 3". He acted opposite Robert De Niro in Luc Besson's 2013 film "The Family". Other film work includes the 2003 indie comedy "Chooch" and 2020 Christina Ricci drama "Faraway Eyes".
Albums.
Bocchetti's debut album, "Thank You", was released in 2019 on Stand Up! Records. Comedy website "Laughspin" compared "Thank You" favorably with Rodney Dangerfield's darkly self-deprecating persona, as did Richard Lanoie of The Serious Comedy Site, who also felt that Bocchetti "is not for the casual comedy fan and requires some patience to really appreciate."
Books and writing.
In 2018, Bocchetti published an autobiography, "Still Standing", covering his life from childhood through his 2017 heart attack.
In 2015, he wrote an ongoing interview column, "The Bocchetti Files", for website The Interrobang.
Personal life.
Bocchetti was diagnosed with obsessive–compulsive disorder at age 26 and is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober since 1997. He had a heart attack in 2017.

We Lost the Sea

We Lost the Sea are an instrumental band from Sydney, Australia. The band was originally formed by friends from multiple bands that had dissolved in 2007 from the outer west Sydney suburb of Campbelltown, NSW. The current line up is composed of Mark Owen, Matt Harvey, Nathaniel D'Ugo, Mathew Kelly, Kieran Elliott and Carl Whitbread.
Their third album "Departure Songs" gained them widespread acclaim within the post-rock and metal scenes around the world. The band have reached notable success internationally for their emotional and energetic live performances and modern and thematic approach to the post-rock genre. They are currently released through Australian independent record label Bird's Robe Records, which is distributed through MGM in Australia and independently worldwide. Dunk!Records in Europe and Translation Loss in North America.
History.
Early years, "Crimea".
The band was formed when Mark Owen approached Nathaniel D’Ugo to start a band with him after Nathaniel's former band Omeratá had broken up. From here they called upon friends Chris Torpy on vocals and the twin brothers Grant and Brendon Warner on guitar from another local band Sound The Mute to join. The idea was to create a huge and heavy sounding project that would act like a collaborative of musicians. The band's member line up has changed many times, at one point consisting of nine members. The band's name doesn't have a specific meaning. The early members wanted a name that creates an enigmatic feeling, evokes emotion and leaves interpretation up to the listener. The group often incorporates themes into their albums such as loss, grief and hope, space exploration, war and stories from history. 
They released their first record entitled " Crimea " - engineered and mixed by Magnus Lindberg of Cult of Luna in February 2009 at Sing Sing studios in Melbourne, Australia. This was released only on CD and independently by the band the following year. This record was inspired by poems written about the Crimean war and famous heroic figures such as Florence Nightingale.
"The Quietest Place on Earth".
In 2010 the band went into the studio to record their second album "The Quietest Place on Earth". Complications and member changes delayed the release of this record until 2012 when Grant Warner and Brad Garnam left the band and Matt Harvey (ex Omeratá) joined on guitars after receiving a last minute call from vocalist Chris Torpy, who asked him to come to a rehearsal. A short time after the band joined with Bird's Robe Records.
The record was received well and was followed up with a handful of highly successful local shows including their sold out album launch and supporting American post-metal band Rosetta where the band debuted the new line up and songs. Lochlan Watt from Triple J and Dave Drayton from FBi Radio both mentioned the band in the best of 2012 in Drum Media's writers poll.
In March 2013, their vocalist, Chris Torpy died by suicide, leaving the band to take a short break. Their first show without Chris took place on March 21, 2013 at the Annandale Hotel, opening for This Will Destroy You.
On April 26, 2014 We Lost The Sea held a tribute and benefit show to raise awareness and money for suicide prevention and education surrounding depression and anxiety in association with beyondblue Australia.
"Departure Songs".
In 2015 the band recorded and released their third LP "Departure Songs" initially through Bird's Robe Records and Art As Catharsis Records in Australia. It was later released in Europe through Dunk!Records and in North America through Translation Loss Records. This record is their first all-instrumental album and was a slight shift away from their old dynamic. Heavily affected by the loss of Chris, "Departure Songs" is a concept album inspired by failed, yet epic and honourable individual journeys or events throughout history where people have done extraordinary things for the greater good of those around them, and the progress of the human race itself. Each song has its own story and is a soundtrack to that story with its own piece of art to illustrate the journeys within the songs.
The artwork, made by guitarist Matt Harvey, helped wrap the theme of this record together with the music and found acclaim on its own merit with an article in Digital Arts Magazine (UK) and reaching over 42,000 views on Behance.
"Departure Songs" was widely received and reached critical acclaim all over the world in the highly regarded post-rock scene and even breaking out of the boundaries to reach different audiences everywhere. Their song "A Gallant Gentleman", the main single from the album and featuring a Sydney girls school choir, has been featured on video projects, student films, and promotion for media brands and football clubs and most recently featured on the soundtrack for Ricky Gervais' show After Life released on Netflix in 2019. The final song on the album, Challenger - Part 1: Flight has been used for interpretative dance routines and over documentaries. One album stream on YouTube had more than 4.6 million views in June 2020.
"Triumph And Disaster".
In October 2019 the band released their fourth album "Triumph And Disaster".
Tours.
The album "Departure Songs" generated enough buzz for the band to pursue extensive national tours of Australia. They were also invited to support post-rock and post-metal bands Baroness, Maybeshewill, This Will Destroy You, Caspian, Pelican, Earth, Jakob (NZ) and Japan's Mono and Boris on their Australian visits. Even being offered the support for Finnish cello-metal band Apocalyptica on their Australian tour.
First Australian headline tour.
The band embarked on a nine date tour of Australia over the course of June and July 2016. The tour finished at a sold-out show at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney where they played with the VOX youth choir from Sydney Philharmonia Choir.
The Last Dive Tour.
In January 2017 the band did a 3 date east coast headline run to celebrate the end of the "Departure Songs" album cycle in Australia before heading to Europe. It also signified the last shows guitarist Brendon Warner would play with the band after deciding to leave to focus on studies. The Sydney Morning Herald listed the Sydney show at the Newtown Social Club as top 5 gig of the week next to artists like Nick Cave, PJ Harvey and Refused. Both the Sydney and Melbourne shows sold out.
European Tour 2017.
In May 2017 the band embarked on their first ever overseas tour to Europe with their debut show at the Belgian post-rock festival Dunk! This was followed by 16 shows around the continent playing some shows to sold-out crowds such as A38 in Budapest and WERK-2 in Leipzig and ending with a huge sold-out show in Paris. Carl Whitbread (Lo!, Omeratá) came on board as their touring guitarist for this tour. The tour also included Sydney post-rock/prog bands Meniscus and Dumbsaint.
TQPOE 5 year anniversary tour.
In December 2017 the group decided to tour in celebration of their second album "The Quietest Place on Earth"’s fifth anniversary. They felt that it was underrepresented when it was released and Chris had passed away so soon after its official release that there was only a handful of shows played during that time. Joining them to fill in on vocals for this tour was Jarrod Krafczyk (The Amenta, Omeratá) and former guitarist Brendon Warner filled in on third guitar. This tour also included a last minute support addition from Rosetta who were in Australia touring with sleepmakeswaves at the time.
This tour is also when the band started working with Australian music booking agents Select Touring.
China tour 2018.
On 22 March 2018 the band embarked on a 10 show tour of China managed by the touring company New Noise. This was their first tour to Asia and they played in front of their biggest headline crowd to date at Shenzhen B10 Live, concluding with a show at This Town Needs (formerly Hidden Agenda) in Hong Kong. One of the first shows after it re-opened after UK band This Town Needs Guns had issues with immigration the previous year.
Record releases.
The band have had multiple pressings done of their records. They are known for high quality artwork and multiple colour variations. Most notably is Departure Songs which has been pressed 3 times with a total of 9 colour variations. All current pressings have sold out.
Musical style and influences.
The band's sound has changed over the years while the basis and heart of the music has stayed relatively the same. The loss of their vocalist made the band choose to release instrumental music whereas previously the band had been associated with post-metal, doom and sludge metal genres. They have always leaned towards thematic, long, atmospheric and heavy styles of writing and even with vocals there are many instrumental parts throughout their albums. The band has been referred to sounding like and being influenced by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mogwai, Cult of Luna, Explosions In The Sky and The Cinematic Orchestra.

Qing literati

Qing literati ("wenren" Chinese:文人) were scholars in the Qing dynasty (1636-1911) educated in the Confucian curriculum, the "Four Books and Five Classics", and sometimes called "shi"(Chinese:士), scholar, and "shen"(Chinese:绅), or gentry. They were defined by their education and lifestyle, whether or not they gained their ambition of passing the Imperial examinations or becoming scholar-officials. They typically began their studies when young. They attempted to pass three tests throughout their lives. Candidates who achieved the lower degree were called "shengyuan" (Chinese:生员); those who passed the second level could take the third and highest test, held in Beijing every three years; those who passed this highest test were "jinshi". 
Literati life.
Examination success meant earning a chance of appointment to office, but those chances changed dramatically from Ming to Qing as the population rose but the number of official positions did not. All but palace degree-holders had far less opportunity by the late Ming, while in the Qing even palace degree-holders frequently had to wait years to gain an appointment as a magistrate or prefect. Social prestige, legal privileges and corvée labor exemptions kept most commoner families from competing in the examination market. The diminishing opportunities for examination success by the nineteenth century exacerbated tensions and human frailties. 
The system brought fame and fortune to a few, but left most dealing with disappointment. Those who failed mocked the exams in popular novels, such as Wu Jingzi's (1701-1754) "The Scholars", and vernacular stories by Pu Songling (1640-1715). Such narratives looked at the examination process from the point of view of the failures. These nonofficial accounts used dreams and auspicious events to explain success or failure.

Operation Pocahontas Forest

Operation Pocahontas Forest was a security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. Americal Division and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division in the Quế Sơn Valley, South Vietnam from 6 to 31 July 1968.
Background.
At the beginning of July, Allied intelligence indicated that the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 1st Regiment, 2nd Division was operating near Hiệp Đức at the western end of the Quế Sơn Valley. General William B. Rosson ordered Major General Charles M. Gettys, commander of the Americal Division to secure the area.
Operation.
Operation Pocahontas Forest was launched on 6 July to search for the 1st Regiment and preempt a possible attack on Hiệp Đức.
MG Gettys formed a brigade-size task force under the command of his deputy Division commander BG Howard H. Cooksey. "Task Force Cooksey" comprised the 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, a mechanized platoon from Troop F, 17th Cavalry Regiment, a company from the 26th Engineer Battalion and four MIKE Force companies. The ARVN 2nd Division contributed a separate combat group comprising the 2nd and 4th Battalions, 5th Infantry Regiment, supported by an artillery battery.
During the initial phase of the operation the Allied force located some supply caches around Hiệp Đức, but did not make contact with the 1st Regiment.
On 11 July MG Gettys added the 5th Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, to "Task Force Cooksey" and on 21 July he added the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, but even this expanded force made little contact with the PAVN.
Aftermath.
The operation ended on 31 July, with PAVN losses of 127 killed while U.S. losses were 18 killed. While the Allied forces had not engaged the 1st Regiment directly, it had succeeded in keeping them away from Hiệp Đức and improved security in the Quế Sơn Valley to allow for pacification.

The Lost and the Plunderers

"The Lost and the Plunderers" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on March 4, 2018. It was written by Angela Kang, Channing Powell and Corey Reed, and directed by David Boyd.
Plot.
After burying Carl, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) gather their remaining supplies from Alexandria and abandon the community as walkers overrun it; Michonne tries to stop a fire from overtaking a gazebo Carl enjoyed, but Rick convinces her to let it go. On the road, Rick considers what Carl told him, and from his advice, heads to see Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) and the Scavengers, who had witnessed what happened at the Saviors' Sanctuary. Elsewhere, Enid (Katelyn Nacon) and Aaron (Ross Marquand) are taken to the Oceanside community as prisoners for killing their leader, Natania. Natania's granddaughter Cyndie (Sydney Park), after hearing Enid's pleas, decides to let the two live, but orders them to never return. Once escorted outside Oceanside, Aaron insists Enid get back to the Hilltop to let them know what happened while he will try to go back to Oceanside and convince them to help.
Meanwhile, at the Sanctuary, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) orders his men to seek out the Alexandria residents and instructs Simon (Steven Ogg) to go to the Scavengers with his "standard offer," to kill one of them to bring the rest in line, reminding him that he values the people as resources to be saved otherwise. Just then, they receive a box sent by the Hilltop community with the message to "stand down", containing the reanimated body of Dean (Adam Fristoe), one of Simon's men. Simon, not pleased with Negan's approach and knowing the Hilltop has the rest of his 38 men in captivity, goes to the Scavengers' junkyard and accuses Jadis of going back on their deal with the Saviors, but gives her Negan's offer of returning to the original terms of their deal and giving over all their guns. Jadis agrees, but Simon does not believe Jadis is showing enough remorse and kills her two lieutenants, Tamiel (Sabrina Gennarino) and Brion (Thomas Francis Murphy), in cold blood. She punches him, causing Simon to then order his men to kill the rest of the Scavengers. After, Simon reports back to Negan that all went well, though he spots paint on his shoe from the scuffle with Jadis.
By the time Rick and Michonne arrive at the junkyard, all of the Scavengers but Jadis have reanimated. They find Jadis alone, having dropped her aloof nature. She explains that she had been an artist before the outbreak, having used the junkyard for materials, but afterwards, she and the Scavengers saw the junkyard as a way to keep themselves isolated from the rest of the world while using the entire yard as their canvas. Rick blames the death of the Scavengers on Jadis for betraying them and siding with The Saviors. Tired of Jadis' double-crosses and deeming her useless now that her entire group is dead, he decides to abandon her as he and Michonne escape. Jadis begs to go with them but Rick fires a warning shot to scare her away. Jadis lures the remaining walkers into an industrial shredder to protect herself, crying to herself as she watches her former friends be destroyed. As they drive away, Rick explains to Michonne that he wasn't going to kill and that he only fired a warning shot because he wanted her gone. Michonne believes that not wanting to kill people is what Carl was talking about before dying. Rick pulls over and takes a moment to stop and read Carl's letters, including one he wrote to Negan. Inclined to contact Negan over walkie-talkie, Rick decides to inform him that Carl is dead and that his son wrote a letter to Negan, asking him to stop fighting. Negan receives the news and is deeply saddened, but Rick vows to keep fighting and kill Negan. Negan retorts that it was Rick's intense focus on his war with Negan that led to Carl's death and that Negan helps save people whereas Rick cannot. Negan tells Rick that Rick has failed as both a leader and father. He demands Rick to stop fighting and making decisions that will keep getting people killed, and to give up because he has already lost.

NSW Police Legacy

NSW Police Legacy is a charitable organisation that was established in 1987 to care for the widows, widowers, partners and children of deceased members of the NSW Police Force. The charity was originally established with assistance from the NSW Premier, and the Police Association of New South Wales, enabling the organisation to set up in the Police Association’s building on Elizabeth Street in Sydney.
NSW Police Legacy has now expanded its reach to care also for the parents of deceased officers, special constables, serving and retired police facing difficult circumstances, and police officers who are moving into civilian life, via the BACKUP for Life program.
Fundraising.
Apart from the BACKUP for Life program, NSW Police Legacy receives no government funding. It depends on donations and fundraising events to finance its programs. Major annual events the organisation runs include the Blue Ribbon Ball, the Remembrance Bike Ride, the annual Kokoda Trek, and the Police Boxing event. 
There are numerous other small events held by individuals and Local Area Commands in support of the organisation. 
Services.
NSW Police Legacy supports its legatees through financial assistance in the form of education grants and scholarships, welfare grants to families or individuals facing need, retraining for returning to the workforce, and funding for counselling. It also provides social support in the form of camps for young legatees, parental support networks, welfare checks, local area lunches, Christmas lunches, annual family day, and remembrance days. 
BACKUP for Life.
In 2016, as a joint project of NSW Police Legacy and the NSW state government, the BACKUP for Life program was established. This program assists former police officers with mentoring and counselling services, career coaching and referrals, a careers incentive scheme, and assistance as they transition back into civilian life.

Jessie, South Australia

Jessie was a town in the Australian state of South Australia whose site is located about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about east of the former municipal seat of Naracoorte at the border with the state of Victoria.
It was in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Jessie on land with an estimated area of . Upon the proclamation of the "District Councils Act 1887" on 9 December 1887, it was located within the jurisdiction of the District Council of Narracoorte.
The source of the town’s name is not reported in official sources. An article in "The Narracoorte Herald" of 22 February 1929 does offer two possible opinions to the sources of the town’s name. The first was that "many South-Eastern people thought it was named after a sister of the late Mr. J. P. D. Laurie" who may have had "some influence with the Crown Lands Department" in respect to its name. The second was that it was named after "some other lady" on the basis of the views of "some other historians of nomenclature." This lady could be Lady Jessie Blyth for whom the Hundred of Jessie was named. Lady Blyth was the wife of Sir Arthur Blyth, Commissioner of Crown Land and a former Premier of South Australia when the Hundred was proclaimed on 24 October 1867.
Jessie is reported as being proclaimed on 28 April 1876 by one source while official sources such as the South Australian Government Gazette contain no mention of any proclamation. However, the government gazette does show that land within the town was available for purchase by November 1870 at the latest. A drawing of the Hundred of Jessie prepared in November 1872 by the surveyor-general’s office shows that the town had been located and that a layout of its allotments and streets had been prepared. The town is reported as being surveyed during May 1890. In September 1891, during the second reading of "The Park Lands Resumption Bill" in the South Australian House of Assembly, it was stated that the town allotments in the Town of Jessie all remained unsold and that there were "no occupants on town lots" while the "suburban lands" had been "nearly all sold."
On 24 January 1929, the town was declared by a proclamation under the "Crown Lands Act 1915" to "ceased to exist" along with the closure of all roads within its boundaries.
On 12 April 2001, the site of the ceased town was divided along the alignment of the Wimmera Highway with its north and south sides being allocated respectively to the newly created localities of Hynam and Laurie Park.

Bernard N. McFeely

Bernard Nicholas "Barney" McFeely (April 7, 1882 – August 8, 1949) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the 27th mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey from 1930 to 1947.
Early life.
McFeely was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Irish immigrants, Bernard McFeely Sr. and Mary Curley. His father was a butcher, and his mother started a horse-drawn garbage-trucking business. The business won the garbage removal contract for the city of Hoboken, and the lucrative contract remained with the family when McFeely served as mayor.
Political career.
In 1915, when Hoboken adopted a commission form of government under the Walsh Act, McFeely was elected to the original commission, serving as Commissioner of Public Safety. He succeeded Mayor Patrick R. Griffin as the Democratic leader of the city in 1926, allying himself with the powerful mayor of Jersey City and Hudson County political boss, Frank Hague. In 1930, he was named mayor by his fellow commissioners, filling the vacancy left by Gustav Bach, who had been appointed Hudson County clerk.
McFeely's tenure as mayor was noted for rampant nepotism. He appointed his brother, Edward J. McFeely, to be chief of police. His nephew, Thomas F. McFeely, served as superintendent of the Hoboken school system. By the end of his time in office, dozens of other relatives were said to be on the city payroll, appointed to various positions. The family trash business maintained the city's garbage removal contract, continuing to use horse-drawn carts into the 1940s.
In 1946, McFeely was indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiring with ten other city and police officials to oppress a group of Hoboken police officers who had sued for overtime pay due to them for working seven days a week during World War II. The defendants included his brother Edward, the chief of police, as well as two nephews, who served as deputy police chief and a police captain. McFeeley's attacks on the "rebel" police officers led to the formation of a Fusion ticket to oppose the mayor's Democratic organization in the 1947 election for city commission.
McFeely and his Democratic machine were defeated by the Fusion ticket in May 1947, and Fred M. De Sapio succeeded him as mayor. McFeely's unexpected defeat contributed to Frank Hague's decision to announce his retirement from politics shortly thereafter.
McFeely was scheduled to go on trial in the police case shortly after the 1947 election. However, trial was postponed several times due to illness. He was still under indictment when he died on August 8, 1949 at the age of 67. He never married.

Gonatopsis okutanii

Gonatopsis okutanii is a species of squid from the family Gonatidae from the northern Pacific Ocean. It is of uncertain taxonomic status, the presence of remnant tentacles on spent females indicate that this species does not belong in the genus "Gonatopsis" and the differences between this species and "Gonatus makodai" have led to some authorities stating that "G. okutanii" is a junior synonym of "Eogonatus tinro". However the World Register of Marine Species still recognises "Gonatopsis okutanii" as the valid name for this taxon.
Description.
"Gonatopsis okutanii" is a medium-sized species of squid with a gelatinous body, 5 teeth on the radula and long, thin arms. Arms II &amp; III are very long and slender; and their length is at least equal to the mantle length. The arms have thick bases but become weak and narrow towards their tips. Arms I-III have 2 rows of hooks in the middle and 2 rows of small suckers while arm IV only has suckers. All the arms have 5-10 pairs of medial hooks or suckers which are spaced wide apart, the arm suckers have 7-9 teeth placed on the distal edge of their ring. All known specimens are spent females which have short, remnants of tentacles situated between the proximal ends of arms III and IV. They have very large eyes, a buccal membrane which has 7 lappets and there is in nuchal crest which has three or four indistinct nuchal folds on either side along its length. The radula has teeth in five transverse rows. The mantle is thick, soft, gelatinous and conical in shape with a mantle length which varies between 18 cm and 25 cm. The skin is dark purple in colour marked with "eye patches". It has short rhomboid shaped, narrow fins and a short tail.
Tentacles are present on the subadult specimens described as "Eogonatus tinro" and these have a tentacular club lacking any hooks and with equal sized suckers arranged in numerous irregular rows.
Distribution.
"Gonatopsis okutanii" occurs in the North Pacific Ocean from Japan in the east to Alaska and Canada in the west.
Habitat and biology.
"Gonatopsis okutanii" is reported to have relatively large eggs up to 2.3 mm in length, compared to female body size. The male and female appear to copulate "head to head", and the adult females do not appear to die after their first breeding. They are caught at intermediate depths and spent females have been collected at depths of between 525m and 550 m and have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales.
Naming.
Some authorities treat "Gonatopsis okutanii" as a junior synonym of "Eogonatus tinro" and the two taxa were described in the same paper by Kir Nesis, "G. okutanii" was based on spent females, while "E. tinro" was based on young squid, however "E. tinro" has priority.

CBS Sports HQ

CBS Sports HQ is a streaming video sports channel operated by the CBS Sports and ViacomCBS Streaming divisions of ViacomCBS focused on airing sports news, highlights and scores, similar to pre-2010 ESPNews. CBS Sports HQ is co-headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Like its sister station CBSN, it is designed primarily as a digital-oriented service and is available for free on a multitude of platforms, including smartphones, tablets, computers, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku. It can also be accessed through the CBS Sports app for iOS and Android, Pluto TV, Xumo and Paramount+ rather than traditional platforms such as television, broadcast or otherwise. The service is designed with younger audience in mind, allowing a viewer to get continuously updated information from the world of sports in a fast-paced format at any time of the day. It can be watched as a linear channel or as on-demand segments. The network carries eight minutes of advertising per hour and operates live, on average, 10 hours daily.
History.
Planning for the service began in early 2017. It was described early on as being the "CBSN for sports". CBS Sports HQ was launched on February 26, 2018, after success with CBSN and CBS All Access. Nick Kostos previewed the launch at 5pm and then Chris Hassel and Dalen Cuff kicked the broadcast off at 7pm that night. Speaking to investors after reporting fourth-quarter earnings in 2018, CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves stated the company had garnered a combined five million subscribers to its “CBS All Access” streaming service and an over-the-top version of Showtime and expected to surpass its goal of 8 million subscribers by 2020. Meanwhile, CBSN saw streams rise by 17% in 2017 compared to the year-earlier period.
In late 2018, headquarters operations and a studio dedicated fully to Sports HQ were established in Stamford, Connecticut, with "split daily operations of Sports HQ between Stamford and Fort Lauderdale".
Programming.
CBS Sports HQ draws content from CBS Sports along with its various digital properties, such as 247Sports, SportsLine, CBS Sports Fantasy and MaxPreps to deliver live news reports, game previews, post-game analysis, highlights and in-depth statistical breakdowns to connected devices, without focusing on "loud arguments or bloated diatribes".
CBS Sports HQ used to display continuous information on a "R"-shaped ticker placed at the lower and right-sides of the TV screen, which isn't visible during commercial breaks. The lower third ticker contains scores, brief news alerts, the day's sports headlines and fixtures in an ESPN BottomLine-styled format. The right-side ticker predominantly features statistics, tables, and fixtures. 
On November 10, 2020, the R-bar was dropped, leaving only the lower third that was "made taller by over 33,5%" in order to simplify the presentation. It displays all of its own content and those adopted from the R-bar, as well as those related directly to what's being discussed on air.
CBS Sports HQ covers an extremely wide range of sports leagues, including those that CBS doesn't have rights to broadcast. Its programming includes recurring segments such as "Morning Trends" (top sports stories in social media), "At This Hour" (five key headlines of the hour), "News in 90" (four or five key stories of the day) and "HQ Refresh" (top stories and scores of the day).
In contrast to CBSN, which carries some over-the-air CBS News programming on a time delay, CBS Sports HQ does not carry any longform content from CBS television or CBS Sports Network. Live sporting events are also absent from the network's programming.
On March 11–13, 2020, some of CBS Sports HQ's programming was simulcast on CBS Sports Network due to the CBS Broadcast Center being closed for disinfection as a result of two employees testing positive for the COVID-19 virus. CBS Sports HQ was unaffected as it was not based from that location.
Anchors.
Many of CBS Sports Digital's writers and analysts will also contribute, including national college football writer Dennis Dodd; senior NFL columnist Pete Prisco; and college basketball columnist Gary Parrish.

Bachtrack

Bachtrack is a London-based international online music magazine which publishes listings of classical music, opera, ballet and dance, as well as reviews of these genres, interviews and general feature articles.
History.
Bachtrack Ltd was registered on 3 December 2007 by David Karlin and Alison Karlin. The website bachtrack.com was launched in January 2008, the following month.
"Bachtrack"s event finder initially covered the UK only. In 2009, coverage expanded to include the US and Europe. The finder permitted users to "search for events by date, country, city, festival, venue, work, composer or musician". By 2010, the site listed 7,000 events and was being described favourably by both local London and national UK press. "Bachtrack"s first mobile app was launched in late 2009.
In July 2010, "Bachtrack" was named as no. 5 in "Classical Music" magazine's top ten Web Winners.
Later in 2010, "Bachtrack" started publishing reviews of classical music to accompany its listings database. In 2013, a redesigned site permitted operation in French and German, with some original content written in those languages. Spanish was added the following year; however, the main language of the site remains English.
Database of event listings.
"Bachtrack"s database of forthcoming performances covers events worldwide, although coverage varies by country, with the UK generally having the largest number of events listed. The content is crowdsourced, with many listings input by users, who are often the promoters of the event.
Annual classical music statistics.
Every January, "Bachtrack" publishes statistics about the performances listed in its database for the previous year. These receive widespread media attention across the world, in many publications including "The New York Times", "The Wall Street Journal", "The Guardian", France Musique, Clásica FM Radio, and "Izvestia".
Reviews.
"Bachtrack" publishes reviews of concerts, opera, ballet and dance performances in a large number of countries, claiming to have published its 10,000th review in December 2016. "Bachtrack"s reviews are referred to by other arts publications and performers' websites.
Articles.
In addition to reviews, "Bachtrack" publishes general articles including previews of festivals and concert/opera seasons, as well as interviews with performers and industry figures. A number of interviews have sparked interest in the general media, including soprano Lisette Oropesa's statement that she needed to lose weight in order to be cast in the roles she wanted, and tenor Stuart Skelton's comments about English National Opera.

Wang Ziming (footballer)

Wang Ziming (; born 5 August 1996) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for Chinese Super League side Beijing Sinobo Guoan.
Club career.
Wang Ziming joined Qingdao Jonoon's youth academy in 2010 when Qingdao Hailifeng was dissolved due to match-fixing. He was promoted to Qingdao Jonoon's first team squad in the summer of 2014. He made his senior debut on 4 October 2014 in a 1–1 home draw against Yanbian FC, coming on as a substitute for Cristian Dănălache in the 73rd minute. On 25 September 2016, he scored his first senior goal in a 1–0 win over Hunan Billows.
On 14 July 2017, Wang transferred to Chinese Super League side Beijing Sinobo Guoan with a five-year contract. He was then loan back to Qingdao Jonoon for the rest of the 2017 season. Wang returned to Beijing Guoan in January 2018.

He became a regular feature in the Guoan lineup in the 2019 season, featuring a total of 25 times and scoring 7 goals. He was favored by Roger Schmidt and was caped consistently from matchday 12 to matchday 19 in Guoan's Chinese Super League campaign. His performance earned him a spot in the Chinese national team. However, he briefly fell out of favor under Bruno Génésio, who replaced Schmidt toward the later half of the season. Wang eventually earned his way back to the match squad and scored twice as substitute in the last four games of the season. Wang was considered a lucky charm for the team by the Chinese media as four of his seven goals were scored after the 88th minute.

Licht en Liefde

Blindenzorg Licht en Liefde is a Belgian non-profit organisation that aids the blind and the visually impaired in Flanders and Brussels.
Foundation.
At the start of the 20th century, Belgian individuals who were visually impaired were largely dependent on their families. Blind children received education in specialised schools, but initiatives for adults were few. The "Maatschappij tot Onderstand der Blinden" (K.M.B.S.) was the first Belgian organisation to offer financial support and vocational training to this group. It was located in Antwerp.
After the First World War, four different care associations for the blind were founded in Belgium within a timespan of five years. This was in part because of the large number of war veterans that were blinded during World War I. In 1919, "La Lumière" was established. 1922 saw the foundation of "Ligue Braille" and "Oeuvre Nationale des Aveugles". Their Flemish counterpart, "Blindenzorg Licht en Liefde", was created in 1923. The initiative was established by two priests who taught at a school for the blind in Spermalie, a small hamlet in Bruges. They were led by seminary president Kamiel Callewaert.
Development (1923-1933).
The main goal of Licht en Liefde was to offer support and braille literature to alumni of the Spermalie school for the blind. Volunteers transcribed pre-existing books into braille. This initiative later became the first Flemish braille library. A secondary goal was to establish a federation for individuals with a visual impairment in Flanders and Brussels, named VeBes. Over time, Licht en Liefde became an association which provided education, jobs, and entertainment for the blind and the visually impaired. The organisation was financially supported by donations, and by sales of a "blindenbloempje" (blind flower). The staff consisted solely of volunteers.
Consolidation and professionalisation (1933-2000).
From 1933 on, Licht en Liefde employed paid staff members. Regional service centers were set up in Flanders and Brussels. In 1938, Licht en Liefde built a residence for the blind and the visually impaired in Antwerp, which grew into an autonomous organisation named "De Markgrave".
In 1948, Licht and Liefde employed social workers who offered assistance at home. From 1955 on, initiatives such as books with large print, spoken literature, and low-vision assistance came to be. Sint-Rafaël, a school offering vocational training for those who had become blind at an older age rather than being born with an impairment, was founded in 1959 in Ghent. In 1957, a holiday home was built in Brasschaat. It was moved to Varsenare in 1969, and was turned into a day center in 1979. The headquarters of Licht and Liefde were also moved to Varsenare. They originally were located at Jeruzalemstraat in Bruges.
Literature for the blind.
In 1964, Licht en Liefde was given the Visser Neerlandia award for their printed books for the blind. In 1981, the organisation procured an electronic braille printer, which was developed by KU Leuven. As time went by, the home computer became a revolutionary aid to the blind and the visually impaired. Therefore, Licht en Liefde took it upon itself to strive towards making the use of electronic equipment more accessible. This resolution has resulted in a project named BlindSurfer (2001), which was renamed AnySurfer in 2006.
The "Vlaamse klank- en braillebibliotheek", owned by Licht en Liefde, was fused in 2008 with "Vlaamse luister- en braillebibliotheek". The current name of the resulting braille- and audiobook library is "Luisterpuntbibliotheek".
Inclusion and networking (after 2000).
In the 21st century, the principle of inclusion became an established concept. This concept states that everyone should work towards making sure disabled individuals are able to fully partake in all aspects of society. Licht en Liefde strives towards this goal by employing volunteers, who are often blind or visually impaired themselves. Their input is an essential part of the expertise Licht en Liefde has built throughout the years.
Licht en Liefde has set up a network through which it collaborates with organisations such as VeBes, Huis 45, and Sint-Rafaël.
In 2008, a structural cooperation between Licht en Liefde and the Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Blinden en Slechtzienden (KMBS vzw) was established. This network included three new projects:

Kosie worked through the society as an archaeologist. He made contact with Henri Breuil. His theory was that tools made of stone that he found in the soil were older than the San people. He and Abbé Breuil took a trip to South West Africa and Bechuanaland. Breuil agreed with his theory. Kosie was made a member of the Archaeological Society.

With the May Tao Secret Zone neutralized and Highway 1 secured, units from the 15th and 86th Engineer Battalions repaired or replaced 11 bridges, resurfaced the road and created a cleared zone of 100m on each side of the Highway. The engineers also built Regional Force bases along the Highway to support road security and pacification.
Aftermath.
The operation ended on 5 January 1968, VC losses were 126 killed while U.S. losses were six killed.

"O jardim" (; ) is a song performed by Portuguese singer Cláudia Pascoal and written by Isaura, which represented Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. It premiered on 25 February 2018, when it was performed live in the second semi-final of "Festival da Canção 2018", Portugal's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. The song was released as a digital download on 9 March 2018 by Universal Music Portugal.
The song features uncredited vocals from the song's lyricist, Isaura.
Background.
"O jardim" was one of twenty-six songs commissioned by RTP for Festival da Canção 2018, Portugal's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. The composers both created the song and selected the performer for their entry. Isaura composed "O jardim" and chose Cláudia Pascoal as the performer.
Composition.
"O jardim" was written and produced by Isaura. "O jardim" is an indie pop ballad with a length of two minutes and thirty-eight seconds (2:38) that moves at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song is about loss and "saudade": "São as flores o meu lugar / Agora que não estás / Rego eu o teu jardim". Isaura stated that "O jardim" is a song about "adding tension, [...] "saudade", something we have on the chest, any sorrow, and basically for me this song is about preserving that tension".
Eurovision Song Contest.
Isaura was announced as a participating songwriter in Festival da Canção 2018, Portugal's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, on 27 September 2017. On 18 January 2018, Cláudia Pascoal was announced to be performing her song, titled "O jardim". Pascoal competed in the second semi-final, placing second with 20 points after coming second in both the jury vote and the televote. In the final, held on March 4, she came second in the jury vote and won the televote, placing first with 22 points and thus representing Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018.
As Portugal was the host country, the song automatically advanced to the final, which was held on 12 May 2018 in Lisbon.
On 12 March 2018, it was announced that she would perform 8th in the Grand Final on 12 May 2018. The song placed 26th, and last, in the Final, receiving 39 points.
Reception.
Critical response.
Charlotte Runcie of British newspaper "The Daily Telegraph" listed "O jardim" as one of the five best Eurovision entries of the year, and described it as an "electropop-tinged indie ballad, gorgeously intimate and contemporary too. Just lovely". Fabien Randanne of French newspaper "20 Minutes" stated that the song "shines for its simplicity, modesty and the emotion that transcends language barriers". Hans Rollman of American online magazine "PopMatters" called the song a "moving tribute to Isaura's grandmother, and the garden that meant a great deal to them both".
Music video.
The music video for "O jardim" premiered on April 30, 2018.

Fuglede's conjecture

Fuglede's conjecture is a closed problem in mathematics proposed by Bent Fuglede in 1974. It states that every domain of formula_1 (i.e. subset of formula_1 with positive finite Lebesgue measure) is a spectral set if and only if it tiles formula_1 by translation.
Spectral sets and translational tiles.
Spectral sets in formula_4
A set formula_5 formula_6 formula_1 with positive finite Lebesgue measure is said to be a spectral set if there exists a formula_8 formula_6 formula_4 such that formula_11is an orthogonal basis of formula_12. The set formula_8 is then said to be a spectrum of formula_5 and formula_15 is called a spectral pair.
Translational tiles of formula_4
A set formula_17 is said to tile formula_4 by translation (i.e. formula_5 is a translational tile) if there exist a discrete set formula_20 such that formula_21 and the Lebesgue measure of formula_22 is zero for all formula_23in formula_20.

Diuris basaltica

Diuris basaltica, commonly known as little golden moths, or small golden moths is a species of orchid which is endemic to Victoria. The species has suffered a catastrophic reduction in range and distribution as a result of clearing for agriculture, then by urban expansion until only about four hundred plants remain in the wild.
Description.
"Diuris basaltica" is a tuberous, perennial herb tall with between three and seven linear, green leaves, each long and wide. There are up to three bright golden yellow to orange-yellow flowers, wide with a few dark streaks. The flowers often do not open widely and lean downwards. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and more or less erect. The lateral sepals curve downwards, long, wide. The ear-like petals are egg-shaped, long, wide with a green stalk, long. The labellum has three lobes, the lateral ones small, wedge-shaped and pimply. The middle lobe is broadly egg-shaped, long, wide with two widely separated ridges near the base and a central ridge extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from September to October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris basaltica" was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Review". The specific epithet ("basaltica") is a Latin word referring to the soils derived from basalt in which this orchid grows.
Distribution and habitat.
Little golden moths grows with kangaroo grass on eastern parts of the basalt plain to the west of Melbourne. The orchid once had a wider distribution on the volcanic plains of south-western Victoria but has suffered a catastrophic decline, firstly due to clearing of its habitat for agriculture and later by urbanisation.
Conservation.
"Diuris basaltica" only survives in three populations, the largest of which includes about 400 plants on private property. Only five plants are conserved in a reserve and another two plants occur in the third population on private land. The main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance to or destruction of plants, grazing, weed invasion and altered fire regimes. The species is listed as "endangered" under the Victorian "Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988" and the Australian Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999".

Cap Roig Festival

The Cap Roig Festival, is a music and dance festival held in the Gardens of Cap Roig, in Calella de Palafrugell. Since 2001 it is celebrated annually, and all kinds of national and international artists participate.
The festival is held on an open-air stage with a capacity for 2,118 spectators, gathering the artists in a natural area of 17 hectares of surface facing the sea, next to the gardens. The festival generates more than 15 million euros and 220 full-time jobs in summer.
History.
The origins of the castle and the botanical garden of Cap Roig, where the festival takes place, date back to 1927. They were built and designed by the Russian colonel Nicolai Woevodsky, fond of drawing and architecture, and his wife Dorothy Webster, aristocrat English, decorator and amateur archeology and gardening. This couple left their life in London to build their dreams in this unique place by the sea.
The Cap Roig Festival is held in summer, being the most important event on the Costa Brava. The direction and artistic production of Cap Roig takes great names every year of music and dance in the castle and the botanical garden. In 2007, the British newspaper The Independent ranked him second in a list of the 10 best summer festivals. The 17th edition, held in 2017, broke the attendance record with 46,316 viewers, which sold out 20 of the 27 scheduled concerts.

Evidence for speciation by reinforcement

Reinforcement is a process within speciation where natural selection increases the reproductive isolation between two populations of species by reducing the production of hybrids. Evidence for speciation by reinforcement has been gathered since the 1990s, and along with data from comparative studies and laboratory experiments, has overcome many of the objections to the theory. Differences in behavior or biology that inhibit formation of hybrid zygotes are termed prezygotic isolation. Reinforcement can be shown to be occurring (or to have occurred in the past) by measuring the strength of prezygotic isolation in a sympatric population in comparison to an allopatric population of the same species. Comparative studies of this allow for determining large-scale patterns in nature across various taxa. Mating patterns in hybrid zones can also be used to detect reinforcement. Reproductive character displacement is seen as a result of reinforcement, so many of the cases in nature express this pattern in sympatry. Reinforcement's prevalence is unknown, but the patterns of reproductive character displacement are found across numerous taxa (vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi), and is considered to be a common occurrence in nature. Studies of reinforcement in nature often prove difficult, as alternative explanations for the detected patterns can be asserted. Nevertheless, empirical evidence exists for reinforcement occurring across various taxa and its role in precipitating speciation is conclusive.
Evidence from nature.
Amphibians.
The two frog species "Litoria ewingi" and "L. verreauxii" live in southern Australia with their two ranges overlapping. The species have very similar calls in allopatry, but express clinal variation in sympatry, with notable distinctness in calls that generate female preference discrimination. The zone of overlap sometimes forms hybrids and is thought to originate by secondary contact of once fully allopatric populations.
Allopatric populations of "Gastrophryne olivacea" and "G. carolinensis" have recently come into secondary contact due to forest clearing. The calls that the males make to attract females differ significantly in frequency and duration in the area where the two species overlap, despite them having similar calls where they do not. Further, the hybrids that form in sympatry have calls that are intermediate between the two. Similar patterns of reproductive character displacement involving acoustic displays have been found in "Hyla cinerea" and "H. gratiosa", with greater female preference for conspecific males in areas of sympatry.
Three species of true frogs ("Lithobates sphenocephalus", "L. berlandieri", and "L. blairi") are temporally isolated in that their breeding seasons are spaced out in areas where they live in sympatry, but not where they live in allopatry. Selection against interspecific mating due to low hybrid fitness and low hybrid fertility has reinforced the observed character displacement of breeding times.
The rainforests of northeast Queensland, Australia were separated into north and south refugia by climate fluctuations of the Pliocene and Pleistocene. About 6500 years ago, the rainforests reconnected, bringing the diverged, incipient populations of "Litoria genimaculata" into secondary contact. The species contact zones exhibit, "strong postzygotic selection against hybrids" and enhanced isolation from differences in mating call.
An alternative to detecting reproductive character displacement in populations that overlap in sympatry is measuring rates of hybridization in contact zones. The frog species "Anaxyrus americanus" and "Anaxyrus woodhousii" have shown a decrease in hybridization from 9%–0% over approximately 30 years. A similar pattern was detected in the sympatric spadefoot toads "Spea multiplicata" and "S. bombifrons" have hybridized with decreasing frequency over a 27-year period (about 13 generations).
Birds.
The "Ficedula" flycatchers exhibit a pattern that suggests premating isolation is being reinforced by sexual selection. The pied flycatcher ("Ficedula hypoleuca") has brown females, brown males, and black-and-white males. The related collard flycatcher ("Ficedula albicollis") has brown females and only black-and-white males. The two species exist in separate populations that overlap in a zone of sympatry. In the range of overlap, only brown males of "F. hypoleuca" exist and are thought to have evolved the brown plumage to prevent hybridization. Mating choice tests of the species find that females of both species choose conspecific males in sympatry, but heterospecific males in allopatry (see conspecific song preference). The patterns could suggest mimicry, driven by interspecific competition; however, song divergence has been detected that shows a similar pattern to the mating preferences.
"Geospiza fuliginosa" and "G. difficilis" males on the Galápagos Islands show a noted preference for conspecific females where they meet in sympatry, but not in allopatry. Other birds such as the dark and light subspecies of the western grebe show enhanced prezygotic isolation. It has been argued that reinforcement is extremely common in birds and has been documented in a wide range of bird species.
Crustaceans.
Reproductive character displacement in body size was detected in sympatric populations of "Orconectes rusticus" and "O. sanbornii".
Echinoderms.
An example of gametic isolation involves the allopatric sea urchins ("Arbacia") have minimal bindin differences (bindin is a protein involved in the process of sea urchin fertilization, used for species-specific recognition of the egg by the sperm) and have insufficient barriers to fertilization. Comparison with the sympatric species "Echinometra" and "Strongylocentrotus" of the Indo-Pacific finds that they have significant differences in bindin proteins for fertilization and marked fertilization barriers.
Laboratory matings of closely related sea urchin species "Echinometra oblonga" and "E. sp. C" (the species is unnamed, dubbed "C") produce fertile and viable hybrids, but are unable to fertilize eggs of the parent species due to divergence of the alleles that code for bindin proteins: an example of post-zygotic isolation. Populations in sympatry manifest this difference in bindin protein versus those in allopatry. Selection actively acts against the formation of hybrids in both nature (as no documented cases of hybrids have been found) and in the laboratory. Here, the evolution of female egg receptors is thought to pressure bindin evolution in a selective runaway process. This example of reproductive character displacement is highly suggestive of being the result of—and has been cited as strong evidence for—reinforcement.
Fish.
In British Columbia, benthic and limnetic morphs of "Gasterosteus aculeatus" exist together in sympatry in some lakes, while containing only one morph in other lakes. Female benthic morphs in sympatric populations actively discriminate against limnetic males, resulting in low rates of crossing (some gene flow has occurred between the morphs) and low fitness hybrids. Both selection against hybrids and reproductive character displacement in egg fertilization is observed in "Etheostoma lepidum" and "E. spectabile".
Fungi.
A strong case of reinforcement occurring in fungi comes from studies of "Neurospora". In crosses between different species in the genera, sympatric pairs show low reproductive success, significantly lower than allopatric pairs. This pattern is observed across small and large geographic scales, with distance correlating with reproductive success. Further evidence of reinforcement in the species was the low fitness detected in the hybrids create from crosses, and that no hybrids have been found in nature, despite close proximity.
Insects.
Ethological isolation has been observed between some mosquito species in the Southeast Asian "Aedes albopictus" group, suggesting—from laboratory experiments of mating trials—that selection against hybrids is occurring, in the presence of reproductive character displacement.
Female mate discrimination is increased with intermediate migration rates between allopatric populations of "Timema cristinae" (genus "Timema") compared to high rates of migration (where gene flow impedes selection) or low rates (where selection is not strong enough).
Where the ranges of the cicada species "Magicicada tredecim" and "M. neotredecim" overlap (where they are sympatric), the pitch of "M. neotredecim" male calling songs is roughly 1.7 kHz compared to 1.1 kHz for those of "M. tredecim", with corresponding female song pitch preference differences. In allopatric "M. neotredecim" populations, the mating call pitch is 1.3–1.5 kHz. The biogeography of the cicadas suggests that "M. neotredecim" originated after the retreat of the last glacial advance in North America.
The song differences of "Laupala" crickets on the Hawaiian Islands appear to exhibit patterns consistent with character displacement in sympatric populations. A similar pattern exists with "Allonemobius fasciatus" and "A. socius", species of ground crickets in eastern North America.
Males in sympatric populations of the damselflies "Calopteryx maculata" and "C. aequabilis" are able to discriminate between females of different species better than those in allopatric populations; with females of "C. aequabilis" in sympatric populations exhibiting lighter wing colors compared to allopatric females—an illustration of reproductive character displacement.
Fifteen species of sympatrically distributed "Agrodiaetus" butterflies with pronounced differences in wing color pattern likely arose as a result of speciation by reinforcement. Phylogenetic patterns indicate the differences arose in allopatry and were reinforced when the distributions came into secondary contact.
"Drosophila".
"Drosophila" is one of the most studied species in speciation research. Dobzhansky and Koller were the first to study isolation between "Drosophila" species. Since then, other studies of natural populations such as the "D. paulistorum" races exhibiting stronger isolation in sympatry versus allopatry, or the enhanced isolation found in sympatric populations of "D. mojavensis" and "D. arizonae" in southwest America. Rare, sterile hybrids form between "D. pseudoobscura" and "D. persimilis", with sympatric "D. pseudoobscura" females discriminating against "D. persimilis" males; more so than allopatric populations. Other "Drosophila" research on reinforcement has been from laboratory experiments and is discussed below. On the east coast of Australia, "D. serrata" shares a zone of sympatric overlap with the closely relates species "D. birchii". The species exhibits reproductive character displacement, with sexual selection operating on the hydrocarbons of the flies cuticle. Reinforcement appears to be driving their speciation in nature, supported by simulated experimental laboratory populations.
Mammals.
The deer mice "Peromyscus leucopus" and "P. gossypinus" exhibit reproductive character displacement in mating preferences, with heterospecific matings taking place between the species.
Molluscs.
"Partula suturalis" is polymorphic for shell chirality in that it has two forms: sinistral (left-handed) and dextral (right-handed) shells, unlike other monomorphic species on the island of Mo'orea which have only one form (with the exception of "P. otaheitana"). This polymorphic trait has a direct effect on mate choice and mating behavior; as shown in laboratory mating tests that opposite-coil pairs mate much less often. In areas where "P. suturalis" lives sympatrically with other sinistral and dextral "Partula" species, the opposite "P. suturalis" morph is typically present. Butlin succinctly describes one example of this unique pattern:"P. suturalis" is sympatric with the dextral "P. aurantia" and sinistral "P. olympia", whose ranges abut but do not overlap; "P. suturalis" is sinestral in the range of "P. aurantia" and dextral in the range of "P. olympia" and does not normally hybridize with either species. However, where their ranges meet there is a sharp transition in the coil of "P. suturalis" and in this transition zone it hybridizes with both "P. aurantia" and "P. olympia".
The reversal in chirality to sinistrality must have evolved as an isolating mechanism, with patterns of reproductive character displacement suggesting speciation by reinforcement.
"Satsuma largillierti" lives on the western half of Okinawa Island while "Satsuma eucosmia" lives on the eastern half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly in sympatry (a case of reproductive character displacement), but not in allopatry. A similar pattern in snails is found with "Lymnaea peregra" and "L. ovata" in the Swiss lake Seealpsee; with mating signal acting as the sympatrically displaced trait.
The abalone genus "Haliotis" has 19 species that occur in sympatry and one that occurs in allopatry. Of the sympatric species, they all contain sperm lysin that drives gamete isolation, but the allopatric species does not. A similar pattern of sperm lysin differentiation is found in the mussel species "Mytilus galloprovincalis" and "M. trossulus" and has likely occurred within the last 200 years due to human-mediated distribution by ships.
Plants.
Plants are thought to provide suitable conditions for reinforcement to occur. This is due to a number of factors such as the unpredictability of pollination, pollen vectors, hybridization, hybrid zones, among others. The study of plants experiencing speciation by reinforcement has largely been overlooked by researchers; however, there is evidence of its occurrence in them.
In the Texas wildflower "Phlox drummondii", cis-regulatory mutations of genes that code for anthocyanin pigmentation have caused genetic divergence of two populations. Hybrids (between "P. drummondii" and "P. cuspidata") with maladaptive, intermediate characteristics are under-pollinated; increasing reproductive isolation through reinforcement. The maintenance of the ancestral flower color in the allopatric population is favored weakly by selection, where the derived color in the sympatric population is being driven by strong selection. Similarly, in "P. pilosa" and "P. glaberrima", character displacement of petal color has been driven by selection, aided by pollen discrimination. Displacement in flower size has also been observed in the nightshade species "Solanum grayi" and "S. lymholtzianum" in sympatry as well as "S. rostratum" and "S. citrullifolium".
The bishop pine is divided into two populations distinguished by monoterpene, stomata, and alloenzyme differences; flowering time; and needle color: blue foliage in the northern population and green foliage in the southern populations in California. A small region exists where the species meet in a cline—sustained by selection due to a flowering time divergence, thought to represent reinforcement taking place.
Similar patterns of both character displacement in sympatric populations of species have been documented in:
Comparative studies.
Assortive mating is expected to increase among sympatric populations experiencing reinforcement. This fact allows for the direct comparison of the strength of prezygotic isolation in sympatry and allopatry between different experiments and studies. Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr surveyed 171 species pairs, collecting data on their geographic mode, genetic distance, and strength of both prezygotic and post-zygotic isolation; finding that prezygotic isolation was significantly stronger in sympatric pairs, correlating with the ages of the species. Additionally, the strength of post-zygotic isolation was not different between sympatric and allopatric pairs.
This finding lends support the predictions of speciation by reinforcement and correlates well with another later study by Daniel J. Howard. In his study, 48 studies with observed reproductive character displacement (including plants, insects, crustaceans, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) were analyzed. The cases met several criteria such as the trait in question serving as a reproductive barrier and if there existed clear patterns of sympatry versus allopatry. Out of the 48 candidates, 69 percent (33 cases) found enhanced isolation in sympatry, suggesting that the pattern predicted by reinforcement is common in nature. In addition to Howard's comparative study, he guarded against the potential for positive-result publication bias by surveying 37 studies of hybrid zones. A prediction of reinforcement is that assortive mating should be common in hybrid zones; a prediction that was confirmed in 19 of the 37 cases.
A survey of the rates of speciation in fish and their associated hybrid zones found similar patterns in sympatry, supporting the occurrence of reinforcement. One study in the plants "Glycine" and "Silene"; however, did not find enhanced isolation.
Laboratory experiments.
Laboratory studies that explicitly test for reinforcement are limited. In general, two types of experiments have been conducted: using artificial selection to mimic natural selection that eliminates the hybrids (often called "destroy-the-hybrids"), and using disruptive selection to select for a trait (regardless of its function in sexual reproduction). Many experiments using the destroy-the-hybrids technique are generally cited as supportive of reinforcement; however, some researchers such as Coyne and Orr and William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert contend that they do not truly model reinforcement, as gene flow is completely restricted between two populations. The table below summarizes some of the laboratory experiments that are often cited as testing reinforcement in some form.

While he is mainly recognized in the baroque repertoire, he is present in others as well: by Mozart, he was Papageno ("The Magic Flute") and Guglielmo ("Così fan tutte"); in contemporary opera, he can be heard in Péter Eötvös's "Le Balcon" and Pascal Dusapin's "Roméo et Juliette" at the Opéra-Comique; he also engaged in operetta with Jacques Offenbach's "La Vie parisienne" and Manuel Rosenthal's "Rayon des Soieries". Among the other roles he has played on stage, he embodied the husband in Francis Poulenc's "Les mamelles de Tirésias", Debussy's "Pelléas et Mélisande", at the Festival de la Meije, and his role in the premiere in Besançon of Offenbach's "La Valse perdue (the lost Waltz)".
In concert, Mauillon shows the same eclecticism, with a particular tenderness for early musics: he regularly works with Jordi Savall, the ensembles and , and had recorded works by Guillaume de Machaut, for the first time in their entirety, (Eloquencia): "L'Amoureux Tourment" (Diapason d'Or and R10 Classica Répertoire) and "Le Remède de Fortune" (diapason d'Or de l'année and Choc du Monde de la Musique) both praised by the public and critics.
He recently revived the role of Guglielmo in "Così fan tutte" and Monteverdi's "Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" in recordings and concerts with Le Poème Harmonique. With Les Arts Florissants he also performed at the salle Pleyel, the Arsenal de Metz, the Chapels of Versailles, and the Barbican Centre in London for a program of "Grands Motets français", after having been the Spirit of "Dido &amp; Aeneas" at the DNO of Amsterdam and the Barbican. He has toured Europe and North America under the direction of Jordi Savall.

Bindiya (1960 film)

Bindya () is a 1960 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by Krishnan–Panju and produced by M. Saravanan. It is a remake of the Tamil film "Deivapiravi", released early the same year. The film stars Balraj Sahni, Padmini and Jagdeep. It was released on 29 December 1960, and failed to replicate the success of the Tamil original.
Production.
Following the success of the Tamil film "Deivapiravi" (1960), its producer M. Saravanan wanted to remake the film in Hindi. "Deivapiravi" star Sivaji Ganesan advised him against doing so, feeling it would not come well. Saravanan ignored Ganesan's advice, and remade the film in that language with the title "Bindiya". Krishnan–Panju, the directors of "Deivapiravi", returned to direct the remake.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film was composed by Iqbal Qureshi. The song "Main Apne Aap Se Ghabra Gaya Hoon" attained popularity.
Release and reception.
"Bindiya" was released on 29 December 1960. The film failed to replicate the success of the Tamil original, and Saravanan later regretted ignoring Ganesan's advice. However, in a review dated 11 August 1961, "The Indian Express" praised the performances of Sahni, Padmini, Jagdeep, Lalitha Pawar and Om Prakash.

Louis Lekai

Louis Julius Lekai, O.Cist. (* 4 February 1916 in Budapest; † 1 July 1994 in Irving, Texas) was an American monk, historian and university professor born in Hungary.
Life and work.
Julius (Gyula) Lékai was a student at the Cistercian school (Budai-Ciszterci-Szent Imre-Gymnasium) in Budapest and entered the noviciate at Zirc Abbey in 1934. He was ordained a priest in 1941 and completed his doctorate a year later at Budapest University. His Dissertation was an analysis of Hungarian historical research in the period 1790–1830. He taught at the Cistercian school (Gárdonyi Géza Ciszterci Gimnázium) in Eger until 1947. He also taught history at the Faculty of Laws at the Károly-Eszterházy University in Eger (1943–1944). During the Second World War he was a military chaplain for the Hungarian Army. He fled to the United States in October 1947; he became an American citizen in 1953.
Lekai's first home in the USA was Our Lady of Spring Bank Abbey in Wisconsin; from 1953 to 1955 he lived in Buffalo, teaching at Canisius College, and as of 1955 he was in the Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas. He was made prior there in 1969 and served as such until 1976. In sum he was Assistant Professor of History at Canisius from 1952 to 1956. 1956 he was made Associate Professor at the University of Dallas, advancing to full Professor in 1958 and teaching there until his retirement in 1986.
Lekai's research addressed aspects of Cistercian history which were rarely covered before his time, such as Baroque abbeys in France immediately before the French Revolution and Cistercian involvement at great European universities, most notably in Paris. He was able to reshape common perceptions of urban monks and feudal abbeys by applying concentrated analysis of archival sources. His personal fate as a refugee had forced him to learn many languages, so that he had an overview of monastic research in all the major European languages. His general history of the Cistercian Order (subtitled in a manner typical for Lekai "Ideals and Reality") was the standard work for decades, going into several reprints and translations.
A stroke suffered in 1981 made him unable to speak or write until his death 13 years later.

Competitive Sports.
In his youth, Alberto Quadrio Curzio, was a successful and talented alpine skier (in Bormio was trained by the Olympic champion Stefano Sertorelli). He was the only skier, along with Gustav Thöni, to win the Italian Junior Championships in all three disciplines in 1955. He decided to leave competitive skiing on the eve of the 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Olympics to concentrate on his studies. 
Mario Cotelli (Coach and Technical Director for the Italian National alpine skiing team in the seventies) wrote that A. Quadrio Curzio was the precursor of the “independent ski action technique” (later adopted by J.C.Killy) and the “push step technique” (later used by G.Thoeni) .
Scientific Contributions.
His research has mainly focused on three streams of analysis:
a) Theory of scarce resources and of structural dynamics, with significant contributions to the theory of rent and technical progress. Already since the second half of the 1960s, he has shown, through the use of multisector analytical methods, how changes in structural technologies and technical progress could depend both on income distribution with rents explicitly considered and on the achievement of a scarcity limit of some resource, or on the mix of the two mentioned elements. With other analytical methods, he also examined the role of investments in education on economic growth.
b) Institutional and applied economics, with specific reference to the European and Italian economies, highlighting two types of factors for development: the relations between institutions, the society and the economy, on the one hand and on the other, the interactions among the various levels of subsidiarity (vertical and horizontal) as pillars of social liberalism.
c) The history of political economic thought, with particular reference to Italy, starting from concepts on Enlightenment developed around Cesare Beccaria, from the second half of the 1700s and subsequent extensions, up to more recent times, identifying a stream of thought which unites civil progress (of institutionalist economists) with technical-scientific progress (of engineering economists) in creative and sustainable development. Regarding the more properly institutional and social aspects, he has given appreciable attention to subsidiarity and solidarity which find their roots also in Christian social thought.
His scholarly works are mostly collected in a key bibliography and thoroughly examined in a "Festschrift" edited by Gilberto Antonelli, Mario Maggioni, Giovanni Pegoretti, Fausta Pellizzari, Roberto Scazzieri, Roberto Zoboli «Economia come scienza sociale. Teoria, istituzioni, storia. Studi in onore di Alberto Quadrio Curzio» called «Economia come scienza sociale. Teoria, istituzioni, storia. Studi in onore di Alberto Quadrio Curzio» - published by Il Mulino in 2012 with contributions from 32 of his colleagues (many of whom were once his students). A further "Festschrift" was dedicated to him in a volume edited by Mauro L. Baranzini, Claudia Rotondi, Roberto Scazzieri «Resources, Production and Structural Dynamics» entitled «Resources, Production and Structural Dynamics» - published by Cambridge University Press in 2015. This book contains contributions by Mauro L. Baranzini, Claudia Rotondi, Roberto Scazzieri, Luigi L. Pasinetti, D'Maris Dalton Coffman, Heinz D. Kurz, Neri Salvadori, Piercarlo Nicola, Albert E. Steenge, Carlo D'Adda, Faye Duchin, Heinrich Bortis, Kumaraswamy Vela Velupillai, Michael A. Landesmann, Ivano Cardinale, Lilia Costabile, Constanze Dobler, Harald Hagemann, Alessandro Roncaglia, Stefano Zamagni, Pier Luigi Porta, Moshe Syrquin, Marco Fortis, Sunanda Sen, Andrea Goldstein, Keun Lee, Antonio Andreoni. Lastly, other scholarly contributions were assessed in «A compendium of Italian economists at Oxbridge» edited by Mauro L. Baranzini and Amalia Mirante «A compendium of Italian economists at Oxbridge» (Palgrave MacMillan, 2016). In it is an extremely effective evaluation, especially of his research in the first stream of analysis.
Publications.
He has published more than 400 works, many in English – one book was translated into Chinese. The Econlit database contains more than 100 records of articles, works, and books either written or edited by Alberto Quadrio Curzio. Some of his main works include:

Redick McKee

Redick McKee (7 December 1800 – 13 September 1886) was an American government official.
Biography.
Redick McKee was born in the town of McKeesport which was founded by his father. When McKee was five his father died. In the autumn of 1807 his family relocated to Pittsburgh. Throughout the following decade McKee worked on a relative's farm in Washington County and for merchants in Pittsburgh. At the age of 18 he joined the Presbyterian Church as a lay member. It was a momentous occasion for McKee who recorded later that:"I seemed to live in a new world, and became desirous to serve a loving and compassionate Master." He was given the opportunity to become a priest and receive an education in Canonsburg and later Princeton University but decided against it. While still 18 McKee was hired to manage a general goods store and a storage depot in Wheeling. He organized the first Sabbath school of Wheeling in November 1818. Students from various Protestant denominations were welcomed. At particular times there were upwards of 80 students in attendance.
Indian Agent.
McKee joined a three-man commission created by the Federal Government in 1850 to draft treaties with California Natives. O. M. Wozencraft and George W. Barbour were appointed as well and began negotiations in 1851. However they collectively lacked expertise and familiarity with either California natives or how their societies utilized their territories. The Commissioners eventually divided California into three areas so they were largely operating independent of each other. McKee was assigned the task of creating treaties with natives of Northern California.
His party arrived on the Upper Klamath river in September 1851. There was a repeating cycle of violence and reprisals then ongoing in northern California. Local American militias were reported to be excessively violent in "revenging outrages" supposedly committed by natives. McKee and his associates toured the Shastan territories; inspecting the Shasta and Scott vallies in particular. They concluded that only the Scott could support a reservation and the agricultural work necessary to feed the Shasta. This assessment was due to the scarcity of agriculturally viable land in the Klamath Mountains. More promising areas did exist nearby but they were in Oregon.
The Shasta wanted to retain the entirety of Scott Valley for their designated reservation. American colonists from Scott Bar and Shasta Butte City contended for possession of the valley as well. Federal officials consulted with them for what they desired in a treaty with the Shasta. They called for the removal of all Shasta to a reservation placed on the headwaters of the Shasta River. The treaty terms drafted by McKee were not particularly favored by the Shasta or American settlers. The reservation was placed in Scott Valley, although the majority of the valley was to remain in colonist possession. The area specified in the treaty for the reservation was estimated by McKee to contain four or five square miles of arable land.The location of the Shasta reservation was apparently accepted, albeit grudgingly, by most American colonists of the area.
The treaties negotiated by McKee, Barbour, and Wozencraft amounted to 18. McKee pressed for the California legislature to accept the treaties. He argued the reservations were designed to allocate natives to keep portions of their traditional lands while keeping open the many areas bearing gold. The commissioners were stated to have always consulted with local American colonists and miners in establishing the borders of each reservation. Pointedly he went on to argue that unless if someone were to "propose a more humane and available system" the reservations had to be acknowledged by the California Government. The state rejected all treaties and instructed its representatives in Washington, D.C. to lobby against them as well.
The treaties were endorsed by President Millard Fillmore, commissioner of Indian affairs Luke Lea and the recently appointed superintendent of Indian affairs for California Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The treaties were sent the Committee on Indian Affairs in June 1852. After a closed session the treaties were rejected. Ellison suggested that the vast amount of land set aside by the treaties and the expenditures allocated by the commissioners made the agreements unpopular in Congress. In total about or about 7% of the total land area of California was to contain the 18 reservations.
Later life.
McKee died at his son's house in Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1886.

N1 highway (Philippines)

National Route 1 (N1) is a primary national route that forms part of the Philippine highway network, running from Luzon to Mindanao. Except for a gap in Metro Manila and ferry connections, the highway is generally continuous. Most sections of N1 forms the Pan-Philippine Highway except for sections bypassed by expressways.
Route description.
N1 follows a route that runs from Laoag in Ilocos Norte to Zamboanga City via Bicol Region, Eastern Visayas and eastern parts of Mindanao. The highway connects most major regional centers on its route and runs through different landscapes. The highway is mostly named Maharlika Highway, but other sections use different names.
Ilocos Region.
N1 begins at the intersection with N2 (Manila North Road) and N100 (Laoag Airport Road) in Laoag as Manila North Road or "MaNor". It then crosses Padsan River via Gilbert Bridge and enters the city proper of Laoag, where it splits before turning to the east in front of Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol, briefly following J.P. Rizal Avenue before turning to General Segundo Avenue; both are principal city streets passing through the city proper and through its outskirts. Approaching Bacarra, it becomes a rural highway. At Bacarra, it bypasses the town center to the north and runs through a rural area, and then enters Pasuquin, where it serves as a major municipal street. Between Bacarra and Burgos, it becomes a rural two-lane highway and passes through interspersed barangays along the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea) coastline. It soon climbs the mountains upon approach to Burgos, where the highway directly serves the town. The highway zigzags through the rough terrain, and overlooks the beach where Bangui Wind Farm lies. It then passes through Bangui, where it runs as a major street on the town center, crosses Bulu River, and enters Pagudpud, which bypasses the town proper. N1 runs through the foothills that mark the edge of the Northern Luzon Cordillera and runs close to the coastline of Bashi Channel, where the highway zigzags through the cliffs through the Patapat Viaduct, a viaduct that is required for the highway to pass the steep cliffs marking the northern edge of the Cordillera Range.
Cagayan Valley.
Entering the Cagayan Valley region, N1 follows Manila North Road up to barangay Bangag, Aparri, where it turns south and becomes Bangag-Magapit Road up to the Magapit Interchange in Lal-lo. In Lal-lo, N1 is carried by the Magapit Suspension Bridge over the Cagayan River before meeting the Magapit Interchange. At the interchange, it turns southeast and becomes Cagayan Valley Road from Magapit, Lal-lo to Tuguegarao, running parallel to the Cagayan River. In Tuguegarao, N1 turns east at its intersection with N106 (Tuguegarao Diversion Road) and N51 (Santiago–Tuguegarao Road) to bypass the city proper and run parallel to the Cagayan River up to Reina Mercedes, Isabela. It then enters the province of Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya as Maharlika Highway, although it is alternatively called Cagayan Valley Road up to Guiguinto, Bulacan. It serves as the main artery of Isabela alongside N51. At Nueva Vizcaya, N1 traverses the mountainous terrain between the Cordillera and Sierra Madre Mountain Ranges.
Central Luzon.
Nueva Ecija.
The highway soon enters Nueva Ecija at Carranglan. It then enters the "poblacion" of San Jose and Muñoz before turning east by its junction with N114 (Nueva Ecija–Pangasinan Road) in Santo Domingo. It then cuts through Talavera, Cabanatuan, Santa Rosa, San Leonardo and Gapan.
Bulacan.
San Rafael to Guiguinto.
The highway soon enters Bulacan at San Miguel, where it begins on a straight route. It then enters the "poblacion" of San Miguel, which it bypasses, and the highway begins to curve through most of its length between San Ildefonso and San Rafael, where the route runs through rice paddies. It closely follows a transmission corridor between the San Miguel-San Ildefonso boundary and San Rafael, and a Meralco subtransmission line uses the highway on that portion. Plaridel Bypass Road intersects with Doña Remedios Trinidad Highway just before approaching the "poblacion" of San Rafael. The highway curves to the southwest near Baliuag, where the highway is known as Doña Remedios Trinidad Highway, while the old Cagayan Valley Road enters Baliuag. It serves as a bypass of Baliuag, with a flyover built on the intersection with another national road leading to Candaba. At Pulilan, it serves as a principal route through the town center. At Guiguinto, it crosses the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) along with the Santa Rita Interchange, where Asian Highway 26 leaves for the expressway. It soon crosses the original route of NLEX at Tabang Interchange, where it also crosses the Philippine National Railways right of way.
Guiguinto to Meycauayan.
N1 begins to follow MacArthur Highway, which serves as a major toll-free highway over southern Bulacan. It soon enters Balagtas, where it directly passes through its "poblacion". It soon crosses the Bigaa River, where it passes through residential and industrial areas, and curves upon entering Bocaue, where it bypasses the town center. A flyover restricted for use by light vehicles crosses Fortunato Halili Avenue to Santa Maria with service roads serving as frontage and heavy vehicle routes. The highway then curves, then, runs through the residential barangays of Bocaue and soon enters Marilao and Meycauayan.
Metro Manila.
Valenzuela to Pasay.
Entering Metro Manila, the highway follows MacArthur Highway over Valenzuela, which runs on a four to six-lane highway up to the Bonifacio Monument (Monumento) in Caloocan. N1 then turns east to follow Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) up to Pasay. The whole road, bypassing the capital city of Manila, is notorious for congestion which causes delays as well as economic losses in the metropolis. EDSA runs through the central business districts of Metro Manila, most notably Araneta Center, Ortigas Center, and Makati Central Business District. The LRT Line 1 and MRT Line 3 utilizes the center island of EDSA on most segments between Caloocan and Pasay. N1 ends below the EDSA Flyover at N120/AH26/N61 (Roxas Boulevard) in Pasay.
A gap in the highway is filled by the South Luzon Expressway and Skyway between Makati and Muntinlupa. It would have been filled by Taft Avenue Extension, starting from EDSA, going southwards via Quirino and Diego Cera Avenues and ends at Manila South Road below Alabang Viaduct through Alabang-Zapote Road.
Muntinlupa.
N1 resumes below the Alabang Viaduct of South Luzon Expressway (SLEX/E2/AH26) in Alabang, Muntinlupa, where it intersects with SLEX's Alabang Exit, East Service Road, N411 (Alabang–Zapote Road), and N142 (Montillano Street). The highway assumes the name Maharlika Highway, Manila South Road, or locally, National Road. It runs as a commercial artery through the city up to the boundary with Laguna in San Pedro over the Tunasan River.
Calabarzon.
San Pedro to Calamba.
N1 generally serves as a four-lane toll-free highway serving the suburban cities of northwestern Laguna alongside the tolled South Luzon Expressway. Most sections of N1 between San Pedro and Calamba serve as commercial streets bypassing the old "poblacion"s. Most of N1 is four-lane with a painted median divider.
It enters Laguna in San Pedro, where it serves as a major commercial street, with a maximum of four lanes. It then enters the cities of Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, and Calamba, where it turns southwest at its intersection with N66 (Calamba–Pagsanjan Road) at the Calamba Crossing. In barangay Real, the highway is alternatively known as Real Road.
Calamba to Tayabas.
N1 soon crosses the South Luzon Expressway at the Calamba Exit, where the concurrency with the Asian Highway 26 returns on the highway, and passes through several barangays in Calamba. It then enters the province of Batangas in Santo Tomas, where it intersects with STAR Tollway and bypasses the "poblacion". At the roundabout intersection with N4 (Jose P. Laurel Highway) and Governor Carpio Avenue, it turns southeast towards San Pablo. It then re-enters the province of Laguna through Alaminos and then San Pablo, bypassing its "poblacion". It then enters the province of Quezon at Tiaong, passing by the Villa Escudero plantations and going through the "poblacion", followed by the municipalities of Candelaria and Sariaya and the city of Tayabas, where it turns southeast towards Lucena at the Calumpang Junction.
Tayabas to Pagbilao.
From Tayabas through Lucena, N1 then follows the entire Lucena Diversion Road (also known as MSR Diversion Road), which bypasses the Old Manila South Road alignment through Lucena "poblacion" up to the road's eastern end in Pagbilao.
Pagbilao to Calauag.
N1 enters Pagbilao, where it briefly splits into Recto Street for westbound and J.P. Rizal Street for eastbound at the "poblacion". It then becomes alternatively known as New Diversion Road, the longer road bypassing the Old Zigzag Road alignment through the protected Quezon National Forest Park in the Sierra Madre mountain range. It enters Atimonan, where it then reaches the eastern coast of Quezon, and traverses the coastal municipalities of Plaridel, Gumaca, Lopez, and Calauag.
Bicol Region.
Santa Elena to Sipocot.
N1 enters Camarines Norte at the municipality of Santa Elena, meeting the N68 (Andaya Highway) that serves as a southern bypass of N1 which traverses the sparsely populated province of Camarines Norte. After traveling through kilometers of jungle, N1 enters the "poblacion" of Labo, Camarines Norte, where it follows local streets. It then becomes a rural highway again, passing by the municipalities of Vinzons and Talisay before bypassing Daet. It passes through Bicol Natural Park where the road winds through mountainous and hilly terrain. N1 enters Camarines Sur at the municipality of Sipocot, where it meets again N68 at its eastern end.
Sipocot to Matnog.
From Sipocot, N1 traverses the municipalities of Libmanan, Pamplona, San Fernando, and Milaor (where it is alternatively known as Mabolo Road) in Camarines Sur before entering the City of Naga. N1 enters Naga, bypassing its "poblacion" as Roxas Avenue or Diversion Road before turning east at the Naga Rotonda to follow Maharlika Highway to enter Pili, the provincial capital. It then traverses the municipalities of Bula, Baao, Nabua, and Bato.
N1 enters the province of Albay at Polangui and traverses south of the Mayon Volcano. At Daraga "poblacion", N1 turns sharply to the west as it intersects with N630 (Rizal Avenue), which provides access to Legazpi City, and becomes a zigzag road as it leaves the province.
N1 enters the province of Sorsogon at Pilar. It then enters Sorsogon City, where it cuts through the "poblacion" as Rizal Avenue and Magsaysay Avenue, respectively. It turns east and traverses the municipalities of Casiguran, Juban, Irosin, and Matnog, where the Luzon section of N1 ends at the Port of Matnog. Motorists can board a ferry to either Allen or San Isidro in Northern Samar at the port.
Eastern Visayas.
The Visayas section of N1 begins at the intersection with N670 (Allen–Catarman Road) and Allen Old Road in Allen, Northern Samar, just south of the Port of Allen. It runs along the western coast of Northern Samar and Samar, notably through the cities of Catbalogan and Calbayog. It then leaves the island of Samar and crosses the San Bernardino Strait through the San Juanico Bridge. It enters the province of Leyte at Tacloban, where it bypasses the "poblacion". It then enters Palo and turns southwest at the intersection with N686, where a monument to an unknown soldier is located, towards the "poblacion". At its intersection with N70/AH26 (Palo–Santa Fe Road) at the vicinity of the Palo Cathedral, it then turns southeast to the towns at the eastern coast of Leyte. At Abuyog, it climbs the mountain range and enters Mahaplag, where it meets N70 (Tacloban–Baybay Road). It enters Southern Leyte at Sogod, where Agas-Agas Bridge is located, and enters the coastal towns of Libagon and Liloan. In Liloan, N1 enters Panaon Island through the Wawa Bridge, and there, its Visayas section ends at its intersection with N691 and the road serving the Port of Liloan, where motorists can board a ferry to Surigao City.
Caraga Region.
The Mindanao section of N1 starts at the Port of Lipata in Surigao City. It enters Agusan del Norte and takes up the section Surigao-Butuan National Highway from Kitcharao to Ampayon, Butuan, where it turns southeast at its intersection with Butuan–Cagayan de Oro–Iligan Road (N9) to assume the name Davao-Agusan National Highway from thereon. It then enters Agusan del Sur, where it traverses near the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary.
Davao Region.
N1 enters Davao de Oro (formerly Compostela Valley) at Monkayo and goes through mountainous terrain as it heads south towards Tagum in Davao del Norte. At the boundary of Tagum and Carmen, Davao del Norte, the highway briefly splits into two as it crosses the Libuganon River.
It enters Panabo and Davao City, where it is also known as Davao City-Panabo City Road and turns west at its intersection with N916 (R. Castillo Street) in Lanang as J.P. Laurel Avenue. It then runs through the city center of Davao, turns south, and becomes C.M. Recto Avenue, a one-way street carrying northbound traffic, past its intersection with N919 (Ramon Magsaysay Avenue). At the Bonifacio Rotunda, it turns northwest to Davao-Cotabato Road as A. Pichon Street (one-way carrying southeast-bound traffic), then southwest to Elpidio Quirino Avenue and becomes McArthur Highway at General Generoso Bridge I over Davao River, all through Davao City proper. It then enters Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur as it traverses its eastern coast. 
It enters Digos, where it turns west at its intersection with N923 (Digos Diversion Road) and then south at its intersection with N75 to assume the name Digos-Makar Road, which is locally known as Rizal Avenue at the city's "poblacion", up to General Santos City.
Soccsksargen.
N1 enters Sarangani at Malungon, where it runs parallel to Malungon River from there. General Santos City, where it is locally known as Jose Catolico Sr. Avenue until turning west to pass by the "poblacion". It turns north at its intersection with N935 (Hadano Avenue) at Hadano Park to assume the name Marbel-Makar Road, alternately known up to Polomolok as General Santos - Polomolok National Road, GenSan - Polomolok National Road, or Polomolok National Highway. At Koronadal "poblacion", the highway turns southwest at its junction with Midsayap–Marbel Road (N940) and Koronadal–Lutayan–Columbio Road and assumed the name Cotabato-Marbel Road up to Isulan. The highway veers northwest at Surallah and enters Sultan Kudarat at Isulan, where it becomes Marbel-Allah Valley-Cotabato Road.

At the junction of Sinsuat, Quezon, and Don Teodoro V. Juliano Avenues, N1 turns east to assume the name Cotabato–Lanao Road up to Matanog, Maguindanao; its section from the junction to Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao is also known as Quezon Avenue.
Entering Lanao del Sur at Sultan Dumalondong, N1 becomes Cotabato–Malabang–Lanao del Norte Road. In Balabagan, it assumes the alternate name Rizal Avenue as it approaches near the coast of Lanao del Sur with Celebes Sea up to Picong, the last municipality traversed by N1 before leaving Bangsamoro.
N1's section from Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao to Balabagan, Lanao del Sur is also known as Narciso Ramos Highway.
Zamboanga Peninsula.
At the end of the Bangsamoro section of AH26, N1 resumes at Lanao del Norte at Sultan Naga Dimaporo and approaches the southern coast of Lanao del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. At Tukuran, it becomes alternatively known as Lanao-Pagadian-Zamboanga City Road and Pagadian City-Zamboanga City Road, respectively, from thereon. From the "poblacion" where it is locally known as Rizal Avenue, it climbs the mountainous terrain and turns west at its intersection with N9 (Butuan–Cagayan de Oro–Iligan Road) to become alternatively known as National Highway. It then cuts through Pagadian, where it is a principal route locally known as J.P. Rizal Avenue through the "poblacion".

History.
The direct predecessors of N1 were Manila North Road (Highway 3) from Laoag to Aparri and from Guiguinto to Caloocan, Cagayan Valley Road (Highway 5) from Lal-lo to Guiguinto, Highway 54 then in the province of Rizal, majority of Manila South Road (Highway 1) from Muntinlupa to Matnog, Samar-Leyte Road (Highway 1) from Calbayog to Santa Rita, Leyte-Samar Road (Highway 1) from Tacloban to Mahaplag and from Sogod, Southern Leyte to Liloan, Agusan-Davao Road, Davao-Cotabato Road (Highway 1) from Davao to Digos, Lanao-Cotabato Road (Highway 5) from Dadiangas to Mamasapano, Cotabato-Lanao Road (Highway 1) from Sultan Kudarat to Malabang, and Lanao-Zamboanga Road. More roads were later constructed and added, especially when the Pan-Philippine Highway (Maharlika Highway) was conceived in 1965, to altogether form the present alignment of N1 and Maharlika Highway, which was later designated as Asian Highway 26.
In 2014, Department of Public Works and Highways assigned MacArthur Highway from Guiguinto to Caloocan, EDSA, Manila South Road from Muntinlupa to Calamba, and the segment of Pan-Philippine Highway from Laoag to Guiguinto and from Calamba to Zamboanga City as N1.

E1 expressway (Philippines)

The E1 expressway (Expressway 1) forms part of the Philippine expressway network. It runs through western Luzon from Quezon City in the south to Rosario in the north.
Quezon City to Mabalacat.
The southern section of the E1 forms most of the North Luzon Expressway, a 4- to 8-lane limited-access toll expressway that connects Metro Manila to the provinces of the Central Luzon region in the Philippines. It was built in the 1960s and has a length of .
The expressway begins in Quezon City at the Balintawak Interchange with EDSA as a continuation of Andres Bonifacio Avenue. It then passes through Caloocan and Valenzuela in Metro Manila, and the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga in Central Luzon. It currently ends at Mabalacat and merges with the MacArthur Highway, which continues northward into the rest of Central and Northern Luzon.
Originally controlled by the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), operation and maintenance of the NLEx was transferred in 2005 to NLEX Corporation, a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (a former subsidiary of the Lopez Group of Companies until 2008). A major upgrade and rehabilitation was completed in February 2005, with the road now having similar qualities to a modern French tollway.
It is also a part of the Asian Highway 26 (AH26) from Balintawak to Santa Rita exit, which continues the AH26 designation via N1 (Maharlika Highway).
Mabalacat to Tarlac City.
The central section of the E1 forms part of the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway, a four-lane expressway built by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), a government owned and controlled corporation under the Office of the President of the Philippines. The Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) is the country's longest expressway at . Construction of the expressway started on April 5, 2005, while commercial operations started on April 28, 2008, with the opening of the Subic-Clark Segment and Zone A of the portion of Clark-Tarlac Segment. The opening of Zones B and C of the remaining Clark-Tarlac Segment on July 25, 2008 signaled the full operations of the SCTEX.
Tarlac City to Rosario.
The northern section of the E1 forms the Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway, an four-lane expressway north of Manila, in the Philippines. It connects central to northern Luzon, with its southernmost terminal located in Tarlac City, Tarlac and its planned northernmost terminus currently slated to be at Rosario, La Union.
The first section of the project, from Tarlac City to Pura, Tarlac, has been operating on a "soft opening" basis since October 31, 2013, and begun full operations in November 2013.
Part of the second segment, which will take motorists up to Ramos, Tarlac, opened on December 23, 2013. The remaining section from Anao, Tarlac up to Rosales, Pangasinan, opened on April 16, 2014, and the final section ending in Rosario, La Union was completed in July 2020.
Proposals have also been raised for extending the project to Laoag in Ilocos Norte.

Collectively known as the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link Project (NLEX Harbor Link Project), it runs from Congressional Avenue and Luzon Avenue, both components of Circumferential Road 5, in Quezon City to Radial Road 10 in Navotas, linking the North Luzon Expressway to the Port of Manila. Currently, its segment from Mindanao Avenue in Valenzuela to Navotas is operational.
History.
Construction of NLEX Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link), the first segment of the Harbor Link project, broke ground on April 2, 2009, with actual construction work beginning on April 21, 2009. It was then opened on June 5, 2010. The spur road became part of the C-5 Road North Extension and is built to provide another entry point to the expressway from Metro Manila and decongest Balintawak Interchange.
In 2013–2014, the construction of NLEX Segments 9 (Karuhatan Link) and 10 (Harbor Link) broke ground. On March 18, 2015, NLEX Segment 9 was opened, providing continuation to Segment 8.1 that runs from the western side of the Smart Connect Interchange to MacArthur Highway in Karuhatan, Valenzuela.
On February 28, 2019, the main stretch of NLEX Segment 10 from MacArthur Highway to C-3 Road in Caloocan was inaugurated and opened to traffic. However, this section of NLEX Segment 10 was supposed to be operational in December 2016, but was delayed repeatedly due to right of way issues and delayed ROW acquisition. On February 21, 2020, its C-3–R-10 section was partially opened up to its Malabon (Dagat-Dagatan) exit ramp. On June 15, its remaining section up to Radial Road 10 was finally opened. This section was originally expected to open in March 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Route description.
The NLEX Harbor Link Project is the extension of the North Luzon Expressway that runs currently from Mindanao Avenue in Valenzuela at the east to Radial Road 10 in Navotas at the west, where an access to the Port of Manila is found. It aims to connect with Port of Manila, while improving cargo movement between NLEX and Radial Road 10. It is divided into four segments, namely: Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link), 8.2 (C-5 Link / Citi Link), 9 (Karuhatan Link), and 10 (Harbor Link). Both Segments 8.1 and 9 are components of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) of Manila's arterial road network.
Mindanao Avenue to NLEX main.
NLEX Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) is a four-lane, expressway that runs from the Smart Connect Interchange to Mindanao Avenue in Valenzuela. Lying on the ground level east of the interchange, it begins at the intersection with Mindanao Avenue in Barangay Ugong and then approaches the Mindanao toll plazas, widening to 6 lanes serving only westbound traffics. It terminates at the Smart Connect Interchange with NLEX Main and continues to the west as Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link).
NLEX main to Karuhatan.
NLEX Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link) is a four-lane, expressway that runs from Smart Connect Interchange to MacArthur Highway in Karuhatan, Valenzuela. It is the first segment of the NLEX Harbor Link project. It begins at the Smart Connect Interchange with NLEX Main, picking-up from where Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) left off. Lying on the ground level west of the interchange, it then traverses Barangays Gen. T. De Leon, Parada, and Maysan, where two exits towards the first two barangays, respectively, are found. It then enters Barangay Karuhatan, where it approaches the Karuhatan toll plaza, widening to 6 lanes serving only eastbound vehicles, and Segment 10 (Harbor Link) and finally terminates at MacArthur Highway.
Karuhatan to Navotas.
NLEX Segment 10 (Harbor Link), the second phase of the NLEX Harbor Link project, is a four-lane, fully elevated expressway which connects with the Karuhatan Link (Segment 9) in Valenzuela to C-3 Road in Caloocan, where two ramps carry it to the west for another up to Radial Road 10 (R-10) in Navotas. It begins at Karuhatan Exit with Segment 9 (Karuhatan Link) and MacArthur Highway. The section near the northern terminus traverses an industrial and residential area, which necessitated the demolition of numerous houses, buildings, and warehouses. It soon follows the railway right-of-way where it rises up to as high as to provide necessary ground clearance for the viaduct carrying the future Manila–Clark Railway of the Philippine National Railways (PNR). It then crosses Tullahan River, where it enters Malabon. It then enters Caloocan, where past Samson Road and the PNR rolling stock shops in Caloocan, it shifts east of the railway's right of way, which also necessitated the demolition of a wet market. An exit to C-3 Road could then be found before meeting the Caloocan Interchange, where the expressway veers west as the C3–R10 spur alignment with connection to the under-construction NLEX Connector (NLEX-SLEX Connector Road) that would lead southwards to Manila. The C3–R10 section runs above C-3 Road, where a westbound exit ramp towards Dagat-Dagatan Avenue could be found. It then crosses the Navotas River and enters Navotas, where it veers southeast towards R-10 and ends at the Navotas Interchange, which provides access to the Port of Manila via Mel Lopez Boulevard.
At the Navotas Interchange, the expressway has a possible future connection to the proposed NLEX–CAVITEX Port Expressway Link or Harbor Link Port Access Mobility Facility towards Manila–Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX) or Anda Circle, respectively.
Future.
Segment 8.2 (NLEX C-5 Link).
NLEX Segment 8.2, also named NLEX C-5 Link and NLEX Citi Link, will be an segment part of the NLEX Harbor Link Project that will connect the existing NLEX Segment 8.1 (Mindanao Avenue Link) to Katipunan Avenue, a part of C-5. It is divided into two sections: the Section 1 from Mindanao Avenue to Luzon Avenue and the Section 2 from Luzon Avenue to C.P. Garcia Avenue. The planned segment will at first run parallel to Republic Avenue before making a southward turn to Luzon Avenue after which it will then cross to Commonwealth Avenue and end at the intersection of C.P. Garcia and Katipunan Avenues. The segment will include five interchanges at Mindanao Avenue, Quirino Highway, Regalado Avenue, Congressional and Luzon Avenues, and Katipunan and C.P. Garcia Avenues, with three local road crossings at Sauyo Road, Chestnut Avenue, and Commonwealth Avenue.
The project implementation has been delayed for years due to right of way issues, as it will affect informal settlers in 8 barangays of Quezon City. Construction of the expressway segment's Section 1A between Mindanao Avenue and Quirino Highway is set to commence in September 2021.

Tank controls

Tank controls are a control system used in video games whereby players control movement relative to the position of the player character. 
Mechanism.
In a game with tank controls, pressing up (for example on a D-pad, analog stick, or cursor movement keys) on the game controller moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them. This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction players push from the perspective of the camera. The term "tank controls" comes from the steering mechanisms of old tanks, which had to stop completely before turning. Tank controls were common in 3D games in the 1990s, such as "Grim Fandango" and the early "Resident Evil" and "Tomb Raider" games.
Tank controls allow players to maintain a direction when the camera angle changes. "Grim Fandango" designer Tim Schafer chose the system as it allowed the developers to create "cinematic" camera cuts without disrupting the controls. Shinji Mikami, director of the first "Resident Evil" (1996), chose to use fixed camera perspectives and tank controls to make the game scarier. He explained that in this way the player could not see a zombie coming, yet could still hear its footsteps without knowledge of its position.
Criticism.
Tank controls have received criticism for feeling stiff or cumbersome. They have become less common over time and free-roaming cameras have become standard for 3D games. The remastered versions of "Grim Fandango" and "Resident Evil" include alternative control schemes, and later "Resident Evil" games discarded tank controls.

Orites acicularis

Orites acicularis, commonly known as yellow bush, is an angiosperm endemic to Tasmania, Australia and is a member of the genus "Orites" within the family Proteaceae. The species was first described in 1810 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in "Transactions of the Linnean Society of London."
Description.
"Orites acicularis" is a yellow-green coloured, woody, rounded shrub growing to approximately 1–1.5 m (3.28–4.92 ft) in height and 0.5–1 m (1.64–3.28 ft) in width, with many ascending branches.
The leaves are of a conspicuous yellow-green colour; they are glabrous, sclerophyllous, approximately 10-35mm long, and rounded. They taper to a sharp point, which is typically more yellow than the rest of the leaf. The adaxial surface of the leaf has a shallow central groove, and the leaf margins are entire. Leaves attach to the woody stem by a 2–5 mm petiole.
Flowering occurs in December, and presents upon a rachis which can be terminal or axillary. The perianth is homochlamydeous; it comprises four white-cream tepals with a groove running along the centre, and curling under to display the pink style. The immature fruit is a green similar to that of the leaves. The fruits are glabrous and oblong, with an elongated tip of reddish brown. When mature, the follicle is lignified and erect, approximately 15 mm long, and boat-shaped. The boat shape is due to the seeds having been released immediately upon maturity.
Habitat and distribution.
"Orites acicularis" commonly occurs in Tasmanian sub-alpine mountain plateaus, heaths, and boulder fields with a geology of dolerite, granite, and diorite. Dolerite's slow rate of erosion results in shallow, low-nutrient soils with an abundance of rock fragments. In sub-alpine plateaus, depressions form in the boulder fields. There, vegetable and mineral matter accumulate, creating bogs or smaller areas of deep soil. Similarly, bolster heath impedes drainage, creating shallow peats.
Other species of plants that commonly grow in this habitat include: "Gleichenia alpina", "Astelia alpina", "Baeckea gunniana", "Bauera rubioides", "Orites revoluta", "Richea sprengelioides", "Tasmannia lanceolata", and "Eucalyptus coccifera".
Adaptations to solar radiation.
"Orites acicularis" has evolved a number of characteristics to assist with protection from solar radiation in excess of its photosynthetic requirements. Two such adaptations are its abaxial pseudohypodermis and its bundle sheath extensions.
Bundle sheath extensions are formed when sclerenchyma and/or collenchyma cells around a bundle sheath extend to both the adaxial and abaxial epidermis layers of a leaf. The evolution of these bundle sheath extensions in species restricted to open vegetation in the family Proteaceae suggests that it is a recurring adaptation to provide protection against the high levels of solar radiation present.
The "Orites"-type abaxial pseudohypodermis is defined as multiseriate, elongate sclerids forming a reticulum around the sub-stomatal cavities (Jordan et al. 2005) and acts as a further barrier to solar radiation that lies just below the cuticle of the plant.
Etymology.
The specific epithet, , is derived from Latin and means "needle-shaped".

Ciokaraine M'Barungu

Ciokaraine M'Barungu (1909 - unknown), known simply as Ciokaraine, was a prominent female diviner, political leader and human rights activist from Igembe, Kenya. She was a fierce supporter of women's rights and is known for having offered up her son's life in order to prevent a famine during the Mau Mau Uprising.
Early life.
Ciokaraine was born in Gauki in 1909, the village situated in the Igembe region of the Meru district in central Kenya. After her parents passed away, she and her siblings were raised by their grandfather, Kabira wa Mwichuria, a well-known mundo mugo (medicine man). Ciokaraine was her grandfather's favorite and she accompanied him on his healing rounds. He treated people of all ages, and Ciokaraine was exposed to various situations notably involving women and children.
Defiance &amp; Bravery.
Early in 1954, during the resistance to the colonial settlers, a member of the Njuri Ncheke named Kibuti was dragged out of his home and killed by Mau Mau rebels during the Mau Mau Uprising, a war in the British Kenya Colony (1920–1963) between the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), also known as "Mau Mau", and the British authorities. This led to a ruling by British colonialists that accused the residents of Gauki of maintaining supply lines to the insurgents. They planned on moving the residents to Kiegoi, located in the Igembe South Constituency, to ensure they couldn't support the Mau Mau hiding in the nearby forests. 
Ciokaraine stood up bravely against the patriarchal Njuri Ncheke the senior chief of Igembe, M'Mruaa. He then ordered residents of Ithima and Akachiu to gather near the trade town of Maua and bring sacks and baskets with them. It was at this meeting that the colonial government took notice of Ciokaraine. 
At the gathering, the colonial authorities announced to the people that they were to uproot all edible food from their "shambas" (farms). Ciokaraine stood up defiantly and instructed the people, "The yams and bananas must not be uprooted." The Senior chief was displeased with her disobedience and she was given direct orders to explain herself. She responded fearlessly and asked that, instead of destroying the food and potentially starving the entire region, the colonial forces must guard the yams and bananas and stop the Mau Mau from killing any more residents. "I am ready to sacrifice my son if that will stop the killing," she stated.
Recognition.
Her bravery changed the attitudes of the elders and started a system of "shamba-squatting," where colonial forces occupied all farms close to the forests in order to prevent the Mau Mau from stealing the crops.
A few weeks after the meeting, senior chief M'Muraa recommended Ciokaraine for the position of assistant chief. She was appointed the first female headman in April 1954 and held the position until she retired in 1959 after being involved in a car accident while on official duty.
Ciokaraine survived the accident and remained active in her community after retirement. Her legacy continues and she is said to have been as famous as Cierume of the Mbeere and Wangu wa Makeri of the Gikuyu.

Arno Donda was born in Berlin. His father worked as a typesetter. He attended middle school in Rumburg and Berlin before transferring, in 1947, to an apprenticeship with the main office of the statistic office in the region that was, by this time, administered as the Soviet occupation zone. He left the school before attempting school final exams ("Abitur"), but by attending evening classes he was able to sit for and passed these exams in 1949 in Berlin as an external student, which opened the way to a university-level education.
In 1947 he joined the Socialist Unity Party ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" / SED), a new political party formed in the Soviet zone during April 1946, through a contentious political merger. The creation of the SED was presented as a way to prevent a repeat victory of right-wing populism by ensuring that the political left was unified. However, by the time the region was rebranded and relaunched, in October 1949, as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) the SED was itself coming to be recognised as the ruling party in a new kind of one-party dictatorship. During 1949 Arno Donda obtained a job in the main office of the national Trade Commission, promoted to the position of "kommissarisches Leiter" by 1950, which was when he enrolled as a student at Berlin's . He concluded his course in 1954 with a degree in Economics. Donda stayed on at the HfÖ, successively as an assistant, a chief assistant and a lecturer. He received his doctorate in economics in 1957. His dissertation concerned the relationship between retail prices and the cost of living. In 1959 he became Director of the Institute for Statistics at the HfÖ, retaining the position till his unexpected career switch in 1963. He obtained his habilitation (higher academic qualification) in 1962, becoming a professor as a result. This time his dissertation concerned the statistical reflection of the dynamics of performance and inputs in socialist retail trade in East Germany ("Die statistische Widerspiegelung der Dynamik von Leistung und Aufwand im sozialistischen Einzelhandel der DDR"). He was also appointed a member of the Bernau working group mandated to develop the so-called New Economic System of Planning and Management ("Neues Ökonomisches System der Planung und Leitung"/ NÖS).
On 19 December 1962 Heinz Rauch, his wife, and two of his three sons were killed in a plane crash in Warsaw. Rauch was head of the at the time. Despite being only 33, Arno Donda was appointed to take on the position. Reflecting the inherently political focus of the statistical authority, Donda took over Rauch's seat on the Ministerial Council . He was also a member, between 1967 and 1990, of the Comecon standing committee for statistics. Between 1971 and 1990 he was a member of the International Statistical Institute, based in Leidschenveen-Ypenburg (den Haag)): while a member of that he became a founder member, in 1979, of the institute's commission for constructing a "Code of Ethics for Statisticians", which the institute subsequently accepted, by a resolution of its general assembly, on 21 August 1985. Despite the mutual suspicions arising from the Cold War tensions of the period, Arno Donda was widely respected in the international statistics community for his ability and integrity. Between 1980 and 1985 he served as vice-president of the Conference of European Statisticians: in 1987 he was its president. He also belonged to several other international academic institutions. On the domestic front, he became a corresponding member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences in 1979.
The Schürer report and the changes.
Arno Donda was a co-author of the so-called Schürer report, presented on 30 October 1989. Other members of Schürer's team of economic experts included Ernst Höfner and Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. The report comprised an "Analysis of the Economic Condition of the German Democratic Republic, with conclusions" ("Analyse der ökonomischen Lage der DDR mit Schlußfolgerungen"). It had been commissioned by the newly appointed Party Secretary Egon Krenz, for presentation to the Politburo. The analysis disclosed a catastrophic picture. The East German economy was over-indebted and had for years "been consuming itself" ("zehrt seit Jahren von der Substanz"). A far reaching economic reform programme was proposed, but in the view of the authors that would not be enough to avert looming national insolvency. The only remaining hope was massive additional loans from the German Federal Republic ("West Germany").
The winds of Glasnost had been blowing across from, of all places, Moscow since 1986 resonated strongly in the German Democratic Republic. Street protesters breached the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and it became clear that Soviet troops had no instructions to re-enact the brutal suppression of 1953 or 1968. As further changes unfolded during 1989/90 it turned out that the economic solution for the country would arrive not in the form of massive additional loans from the west, but as part of German reunification, which was formally enacted in October 1990. Donda successfully led the successful transition of the East German statistical authority towards integration with its formerly West German counterpart. Till December 1991 he held the title and office, "President of the General Statistical Service of the New Federal States". However, his task having been accomplished the Ministry officials informed him that they had no further use for his services. It was not an unusual experience after 1990 for former senior officials of the East German state, and a sense of injustice is evident in sources. Between 1992 and 1994 he was registered as unemployed. In January 1995 Donda was formally retired, reaching the age of 65 a couple of months later.
Arno Donda died in Berlin.

Atami Jinsha Tetsudo

The Atami Jinsha Tetsudo (Jap. for "Atami man(powered) vehicle railway") was a long manpowerered narrow gauge railway in the province of Izu, Japan which was operated around 1900.
The initially long handcar line was opened in 1895 and connected the coastal towns Atami and Yoshihama on the Izu Peninsula. The train crew comprised two men and a boy. The men, muscular coolies, pushed the car on the up-grades and jumped on the rear platform for a ride when the car was coasting on a level or down-grade. The boy rode on the front platform, and it was his duty to blow a horn as a warning at hills and curves, and to manipulate the brakes. The fare, including tips for the crew, on the road was equivalent to 21 cents per round trip. The line was expanded by to Odawara in 1896.
In 1907 the track was re-gauged to , and steam locomotives were introduced. The line closed in 1923 as a result of the Great Kanto earthquake.

37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion

The 37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion (Spanish: Batallón de Infantería Guardia Presidencial, BIGUP) is the President of Colombia's honour guard service regiment under the National Army of Colombia. It is composed of five companies, a historical company and one artillery battery plus a military band, a fanfare trumpet section and a Corps of Drums. It is stationed at the Casa de Nariño in Bogotá and carries the traditions of Simon Bolivar's infantry guards company raised in the midst of the Spanish American wars of independence in 1815.
History.
In June 1814, the President of the Second Republic of Venezuela Simón Bolívar, inspected the Guard of Honor upon his return to Santa Fe. The guard, which was called the "Guardia de Honor del libertador Simón Bolívar" (Honor Guard of the Liberator Simón Bolívar), provided the basis for the 37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion.
On December 7, 1927, President Miguel Abadía Méndez signed a decree officially founding the Presidential Guard. On August 16, 1928, the battalion was given its current name, with its first commander being Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Perea Sanclemente. Memorable actions of this battalion are remembered such as the protection given to the president during the violent acts of the Bogotazo (April 9, 1948) and during the Palace of Justice Siege on November 6, 1985. Resolution 3446 of August 17, 1955, created the medallion “Guardia Presidencial” and Decree 1880 of 1988 ruled the award merits for this prize given to the distinguished members of the battalion for their loyalty, service and good behavior.
Functions.
The battalion provides security to the Presidency of Colombia by meeting the requirements imposed on it by the Secretary of Security of the President of Colombia. The Fergusson Company is the chief ceremonial unit in the battalion, being in charge of providing guards of honor during military ceremonies such as parades, state visits, and funeral honors. On select days at the Casa de Nariño, the public can witness the flag lowering and raising ceremony in the afternoon performed by the battalion's personnel. The other 4 companies are solely responsible for the logistical security of the head of state. It also supports the 5th Division's 13th Brigade in wartime and in situations of social unrest, mostly taking putting an great amount of care and thought into the security of the President of Colombia and his/her family.
Changing of the Guard.
The Changing of the Guard (Cambio de guardia) is a 105 year old traditional military parade of the battalion that takes place on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 4 PM (COT) in the central square of the Casa de Nariño. It marks the changing of the security command at the palace. The changing of the guard involves the Fergusson Company and the battalion's military band and corps of drums.
Composition.
The battalion is part of 13th Infantry Brigade of the Army's 5th Division, and is composed of 1,400 people: 29 officers, 116 NCOs, 1,189 soldiers and 66 civilian personnel. Today the Presidential Guard Battalion is currently subdivided into several companies:
Their headquarters are located in front of the building of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit on the south side of the Casa de Nariño. Their motto is “En Defensa del Honor Hasta la Muerte” (“In defense of honor till death”).

Financial services in the United States

 financial services in the United States represented 20% of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 in the United States.
The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. In 2018 the share of GDP was 7.4% the equivalent of $1.5 trillion in value-added to the economy. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,801 with more.
The financial services industry constitutes the largest group of companies in the world in terms of earnings and equity market capitalization. However it is not the largest category in terms of revenue or number of employees. It is also a slow growing and extremely fragmented industry, with the largest company (Citigroup), only having a 3% US market share. In contrast, the largest home improvement store in the US, Home Depot, has a 30% market share, and the largest coffee house Starbucks has a market share of 32%.
Profitability.
Government subsidy comprises a lion's share of the profits of the largest banks in the United States. Banks understood to be "too big to fail" take greater risks because they understand that if the risks go seriously wrong the institution is likely to be bailed out by the government. Also for this reason, such large banks borrow at lower interest rates because of the lower perceived risk of institutional failure. The value of the government subsidy to these larger U.S. banks in 2012 was estimated to be up to $70 billion.
Political power.
In the United States, the financial sector has grown in recent decades and now constitutes a much greater share of the overall economy, as measured, for example, by its percentage of the gross domestic product. A leading group of U.S. financial sector firms comprises an oligarchy that has considerable ideological and political influence in the U.S. Congress and in regulatory agencies. This political power has been used to dismantle laws, for example, major portions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited a single entity from engaging in both commercial banking (which entails taking deposits) and investment banking (which raises funds for corporations on stock exchanges through private placement and other avenues), and regulations that govern activities that entail risks to the economy. This political influence in advanced economies like that of the U.S. is as effective in setting legislative and regulatory agendas to achieve greater profitability as bribery and kickbacks are in controlling state action in developing countries.
Wall Street spent a record $2 billion trying to influence the 2016 United States presidential election.

Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers

Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers was an event that brought together the progressive intellectuals of Poland, Western Ukraine, and Western Belarus. It took place on May 16-17, 1936 in Lviv, being organized by the Communist Party of Poland along with the Communist Party of Western Ukraine in order to create the united front against Fascism.
Background.
In Paris in 1935, the International Anti-Fascist Congress of Writers took place, led by, among others, Romain Rolland, Andre Gide, Andre Malraux. The meeting called for organizing local unions and meetings of intellectuals whose goal was to defend culture from fascism. The idea to organize such a Congress in Poland was the reply to that call. Besides, the Lviv Congress of 1936 was a political event implementing the recommendations of the 7th Comintern World Congress of 1935 on the organization of Popular Fronts.
Well-known intellectuals such as Stepan Tudor, Yaroslav Halan, Oleksandr Havryliuk, Leon Kruczkowski, Kuzma Plekhatyi, Halina Górska, Adolf Berman and others took part in preparing the Congress.
Lviv, as the venue of the Congress, was not chosen by chance. In the 1930s, the city became the center of Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian intellectuals, as well as the arena of class struggle.
Spring of 1936 was a hot period for the working class in Lviv. In April massive clashes between city workers and the police turned into firefights. That time could be called one of the peak moments in the left-wing movement's history in Western Ukraine. The Anti-Fascist Congress became a link of this chain of events, and set the goal to express solidarity between intellectuals and workers.
Event.
The event was held in the Tramway Workers' House, also known as the Red Fortress, a cultural club that was built at the expense of workers' donations and constructed by themselves in 1933.
During the meeting, the Congress Hall was decorated with a portrait of Maxim Gorky, who along with Romain Rolland and Heinrich Mann were elected to the Honorary Presidium. The Congress was opened by the Polish communist Henryk Dembiński. The writer Wanda Wasilewska read out the Resolution of the Congress of Cultural Workers.
Representatives of the striking workers and former political prisoners spoke at the congress. In breaks between sessions, the writers made speeches at the factories. According to witnesses, the workers made up the vast majority of the Congress guests. Among the participants, all main nationalities of the country - Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Jews - were represented. Some writers from the Ukrainian SSR were invited.
During the Congress, the following reports were made: "Culture and Fascism" (by Henryk Dembinski, Stepan Tudor), "War and the Future of Culture" (by Leon Kruczkowski), "Culture and Conditions of Human Labour" (by Halina Krahelska), "On the State of Literature, Theatre, Music, Journalism, Education" (by Marian Czuchnowski, Yaroslav Halan, Wanda Wasilwska, Bronisław Dabrowski, Emil Zegadłowicz, Aleksander Dan).
Speaking on the national question, the participants of the Congress expressed in favour of meeting all the cultural needs of the nationalities inhabiting the Polish state. The speakers demanded the opening of national schools, Ukrainian and Belarusian universities, and the equal rights of languages. Yaroslav Halan spoke particularly hotly about these issues.
The Congress debunked the oppressive, pro-fascist policy of the government of the Polish Republic, condemned the oppression of the working masses by the capitalists, bourgeois nationalism, chauvinism, militarism.
The resolution, unanimously approved, urged the intelligentsia of Poland, Western Ukraine and Western Belarus to participate in a nationwide struggle against Nazism, to stop the preparation of a war against the USSR, for the free development of science and culture. The Congress ended with singing "The Internationale".
The tone of the participants was revolutionary, some of them announced an imminent meeting «in a red Lviv».
Consequences.
These political accents have caused a scandal. The Association of Railway Bookstores "Ruch", which had a monopoly on the distribution of the press, issued a circular forbidding the distribution of communist newspapers - Chłopskie Jutro, Język Międzynarodowy, Kultura Wschodu, Lewar, Lewy Tor, Literatur, Oblicze Dnia and Przekrój Tygodnia - previously available in normal sales.
For initiators and organizers of the Congress, it was not safe to stay in the city. Soon afterwards, its participants received a signal: «Leave Lviv». For instance, Yaroslav Halan had to move to Warsaw.
Lviv became part of the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.
Years later, historians of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine regarded the Congress as a great success for their policies.

Defence Act of 1936 (Sweden)

The Defence Act of 1936 was a defence act passed by the Swedish Riksdag on 11 June 1936 which remained in effect until 17 June 1942.
Background.
The Act increased the yearly budget of the Swedish Armed Forces from 118 million SEK to 148 million, roughly 1,5% of the Swedish GDP. The budget of the Swedish Air Force received the largest increase in funding, bumping its previous allowance of 11 million crowns to 28 million. A domestic aircraft industry was taking shape during this time, composed of Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) and AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning. The Navy and Coastal Artillery branches were slightly expanded and modernised.
It was decided that certain Army infantry regiments were to be composed of one infantry and one armoured battalion each. At first, the Life Regimental Grenadiers (I 3) as well as the Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) were considered. In November, however, it was agreed that the Södermanland Regiment (I 10) would be reorganised instead of the Life Regimental Grenadiers (I 3). When Göta Life Guards (I 2) was disbanded in 1939, its armoured battalion was split into two battalions which were assigned to the Skaraborg Regiment (I 9) and the Södermanland Regiment (I 10).
The Air Force was significantly expanded with six air wings.
Reorganisation.

Baby Franklin Seals

H. Franklin "Baby" Seals (c. 1880 – December 29, 1915) was an American vaudeville performer, songwriter and pianist, whose successful 1912 song "Baby Seals' Blues" was one of the first published blues compositions, predating W. C. Handy's "The Memphis Blues" by several months.
Biography.
An African-American, Seals was born in Mobile, Alabama, around 1880. He first came to public attention in 1909 as the pianist at the Lyric Theatre in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1910 his ragtime "coon song" "Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll" (unrelated, except in title, to the later song by Jesse Stone) was published by Louis Grunewald &amp; Co. in New Orleans. The same year, he directed and performed in shows in Houston and Galveston, Texas, where he partnered "Baby" Floyd Fisher, described as a "dainty little singing and dancing soubrette". Seals and Fisher were married, performed together as a duo, and in 1911 appeared in shows in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating their wide appeal.
"Baby Seals' Blues" was published in St. Louis, Missouri in August 1912, with words and music credited to Baby F. Seals, and stating that it was featured by Seals and Fisher, “that Klassy Kooney Komedy Pair". The sheet music stipulated that it was to be played "very slow". The lyrics are similar to those in later recorded blues: "I got the blues, can't be satisfied today/ I got them bad, want to lay down and die/ Woke up this morning 'bout half past four/ Somebody knocking at my door/ I went out to see what it was about / They told me that my honey gal was gone/ I said, bub that's bad news/ So sing for me them blues."
The song was arranged by Artie Matthews, and seems to have sold well. It rapidly entered the repertoire of other vaudeville performers, including both Jelly Roll Morton and the yodeler Charles Anderson, who recorded the tune in 1923 as "Sing 'Em Blues". By late 1912, the tune had also been arranged for performance by bands, and by 1913 Seals was being noted as a "famous blues writer". It was widely advertised in the "Indianapolis Freeman", with whom Seals regularly corresponded, establishing himself as a spokesman for Southern performers.
During 1912, Seals and Fisher performed regularly in Nashville, before a series of engagements in Jacksonville, Mobile, Louisville and Birmingham. They performed with S. H. Dudley's company along the east coast and in Harlem, but by 1915 Seals was working as a solo act. He died in Anniston, Alabama, in December 1915, of unknown causes.

Porcelain trade in Qing China

Porcelain trade in Qing China became important during the late Ming dynasty and throughout the Qing dynasty. The growth in porcelain trade reflected a creative influence that improved the artistic design of the porcelain and generated high demand in Europe.
Economic trade.
In the late Ming dynasty many kilns were manufactured which led the Ming economy. The later emperors of the Ming dynasty like Jiajing and Wanli built more kilns in Jingdezhen. There was more research on materials and techniques for the manufacture of porcelain during the Qing dynasty. The high demand caused the Ming to realize that they needed to properly allocate and manage funds to establish a steady porcelain supply. The additional kilns and management helped the production of porcelain and growth during the early Qing dynasty. However, when the Ming Dynasty ended, suffering occurred during the Qing dynasty when Jingdezhen became a prime location for political turmoil and military campaigns during the Taiping Rebellion. These invasions temporarily stalled the manufacture of porcelain.
Once the Qing dynasty restored the porcelain trade they developed a more efficient way to transport porcelain goods. The Qing emperors like Kangxi helped increase maritime trade which aided the growth of porcelain trade. By using the Yangtze River not only were porcelain materials cheaper to ship but the final product could be transported to otherwise inaccessible regions. Kangxi improved porcelain trade by encouraging private maritime trade by families with private kilns. Once again the porcelain trade was thriving, and helped to boost the economy of the early Qing empire.
Qing porcelain.
There is a difference in the way Qing porcelain was created and why its trade thrived. The Ming, prior to their overthrow by the Qing, used two color glazes on their porcelain. The two-color porcelain was sought by European connoisseurs, but eventually demand slumped. Once the Qing came to power they began to change the artistic design of the porcelain, and experimented with techniques to use five colors. The Qing focused on artistic elements like the use of color and firing at a higher temperature to get a glossier finish. Many of the private kilns trusted their potters with creative freedom. A more creative porcelain piece would bring more profit and boost the Qing economy.
Research on improved techniques for the production of porcelain goods stimulated the porcelain market in Jingdezhen (the porcelain capital of China). The various kilns and the changes of temperature produced a brilliance and assortment of porcelain that helped the Qing economy to thrive. Emperor Kangxi's decision to rebuild the kilns after the rebellion also benefited the Qing economy. The development of color techniques persisted into the Kangxi emperor's dynasty, and further showcased the Qing culture through the artful prints and designs on the porcelain. The same coloring and techniques are still used currently because no substitute has been found for the color and appearance of Qing porcelain.

Pyap, South Australia

Pyap is a locality in the Riverland region of South Australia. It is on the left (south) bank of the Murray River about 7 km downstream from Loxton. It includes both flat land near the river and higher land away from it. The environment is dry, so vineyards and orchards are irrigated from the river. It lies on the Kingston Road from Loxton, at the junction with the Stott Highway towards Swan Reach.
Pyap was first settled as a Village Settlement in March 1894 with 94 members and 187 children on 9,145 acres (3,700 ha) and a total population of 388. The founding chairman was A. H. Brocklehurst and the secretary J. W. Rawnsley.
In about 1900 the government became tired of trying to keep the settlement going and when most of the village settlers abandoned the settlement, sold out lock, stock and barrel to a Mildura-Melbourne syndicate who appointed Mr. William Mitchell Plant as general manager. This firm continued to run the settlement with some success until 1913 when it eventually landed with C. J. DeGaris.
The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Pyap had a population of 155 people.
The writer and ethnographer Daisy Bates lived in a tent in Pyap in the 1930's.

Shepherd Bushiri

Shepherd Bushiri (born 20 February 1983), also known as Major 1 is a Malawian Christian preacher, self proclaimed prophet, businessman, motivational speaker, and author.
He founded and leads a Christian non-denominational charismatic evangelical church known as the Enlightened Christian Gathering based in South Africa. The church has headquarters in Pretoria, South Africa, with branches in other African countries and around the world. Tens of thousands of people are attracted to the church every day. He describes the church as a Prophetic Ministry based on the principle that "God cares and loves people and wants to speak directly to them".
Bushiri also runs a global investment company, Shepherd Bushiri Investments, based in Sandton, near Johannesburg, 27+ mines, with interests in forex trading, real estate and in the airline industry. He also owns a television channel, a telecommunications company, various farms, properties, sports academies and universities. Bushiri ventured into business as a young man to support his community and the work of the gospel globally. His rise to wealth has been called meteoric, using innovative business methods in various industries to accumulate riches . /&gt;
Early life.
Bushiri grew up in Mzuzu, which is in the northern part of Malawi. His mother gave him the name Shepherd due to the complexities around his birth, acknowledging the Lord as her Shepherd. 
He travels around the world holding crusades and meetings focused on teaching, prophesy and healing. In August 2018, he was invited as a guest of honour at South Africa's National Day of Inter-faith prayer held at the Emirates Airline Stadium in Johannesburg, during which he offered prayers of reconciliation and unity. The event was attended by South African leading clergy and South Africa's Vice President David Mabuza.
Given name controversy.
Claims were made in "The Citizen" in February 2019 that Bushiri was born as Chipiliro Gama; "an invoice mistakenly sent to Baloyi Attorneys did not use the popular name Shepherd Bushiri, and instead called him Chipiliro Gama". A report in "The Sunday Times" newspaper for February 2019 stated that "Bushiri's father, Huxley, and mother, Cristina, a Zambian by birth raised him as Chipiliro Gama".
In September 2019, Bushiri's spokesperson and communications director, Ephraim Nyondo, denied the allegations.
Career.
Bushiri is now known as one of the wealthiest pastors in the world and one of the most affluent people in Africa.
He is mentored by multimillionaire businessman and leader of Good News Church in the UK, Prophet Uebert Angel. Bushiri is said to be the most celebrated and popular "spiritual son" of Prophet Angel.
Enlightened Christian Gathering church.
The Enlightened Christian Gathering church is reported as one of the fastest-growing churches in Africa and the world. Bushiri is the founder of the church. He has established and leads churches in South Africa, Malawi, Ghana, South Sudan and other countries. He has been interviewed for television by the BBC, and received coverage also in Al Jazeera, "New African", "Nigerian Tribune", and "African Leadership" magazine.
On the night of 28 December 2018, three people died and nine others were injured during a stampede at the ECG Church caused by people trying to avoid a thunderstorm. Bushiri's spokesman Maynard Manyowa told media that "The ECG Church is not his [Bushiri's] church, it belongs to South Africa and South Africans". Manyowa also said that the deaths were "not his [Bushiri's] problem, but a problem that the church must deal with".
Bushiri's services attract over viewers via his personally-owned television station, social media and in-person attendees. His largest gatherings are held on New Year's Eve at FNB Stadium, South Africa, with over attendees both in 2016 and 2017. The FNB Stadium is the largest stadium in Africa.
His church gatherings have always been well received. 
Shepherd Bushiri Investments.
Bushiri's company, Shepherd Bushiri Investments, is an international investment company, based in Sandton near Johannesburg, with interests in oil, mining, real estate, transportation and the hospitality industry. On 20 February 2018, Bushiri launched one of his hotel investments, a multimillion-dollar property in South Africa. SBI has a special interest in supporting governments, including economies of fragile state countries. In 2017, Bushiri was hosted by the Vice President of South Sudan – Dr James Igga, Reserve Bank Governor and Finance Minister during which a business deal was signed in the area of infrastructure and development. In 2018 Shepherd Bushiri was given the prestigious award and induction into the CEO Hall of Fame by the "African Leadership" magazine.
Charity work.
Bushiri has been involved in many charitable works around the world, including work in Malawi, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa. He formed a humanitarian organization called "Shepherd Bushiri Foundation" with Duncan Zgambo as the CEO, where he provides for the needy and less privileged. He provides charitable donations including livelihood support; educational support for orphans; humanitarian relief in the form of food subsidies. In 2017, he took maize to Lilongwe and spent K85 Million in Malawi Charity. He has invested in young people through his sports academy and through Major 1 Records, which sponsors and show-cases up-and-coming music artists. On 18 July 2018, Nelson Mandela Day, Bushiri launched an Africa-wide school adoption program with donations to a local school. The event was attended by Senior Government Officials from the South Africa Ministry of Education.
In March 2019, Bushiri visited Alexandra in South Africa, where a fire had burnt over 100 shacks. He said that he would donate R (equivalent to approx $) to emergency services "that should be used for the children in the area".
Other.
On 11 February 2020, it was reported by the "Nyasa Times" and "Malawi24" that Bushiri announced that he would be selling maize in Malawi at a price of MK5 000 (US$6.85) per 50 kg (110 lbs), or US$124.55 per ton. The international price for corn futures (yellow maize) at the time of the announcement was US$150 per ton or US$7.50 per 50 kg. The local prices for maize sold commercially in Malawi were three to four times higher than that quoted by Bushiri, selling for as much as MK20 000 per 50 kg According to various reports, thousands of people bought the cheap maize at various sites within Malawi.
Controversies.
Curing HIV/AIDS.
Bushiri has made claims of "curing HIV". He countered that he has never performed a miracle in his life because only Jesus can. Nevertheless, due to claims of unproven miracles, Botswana temporarily banned him from entering the country before courts ruled the ECG church is allowed to continue operating in the country. Initially he was free to enter the country at will, but now is required to apply for a visa every time he wants to enter Botswana.
Fees for public dinners.
The alleged fees charged to attend some of Bushiri's prestigious public dinners have been applauded. It was speculated that he charged R for a seat at his table at a gala dinner held on 23 December 2017 at the Pretoria Showground, and N$ for entry to a dinner held in Windhoek, Namibia in January 2016. Bushiri in several news interviews refuted the published extreme pricing claims for "so-called gala dinners", calling them "fabricated".
Investment schemes.
Allegedly, during a church service in March 2017, Bushiri announced that he wanted to make members of his church into millionaires. Congregants were then told via e-mail to invest at least R100 000 in cash with him within the next two days and were promised a 50% return within 30 banking days. Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claimed to have not received anything back.
The investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in "gold minerals" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. East London, Eastern Cape police spokesperson Captain Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.
Paternity.
It is alleged that in 2010, Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for Malawian kwacha (about R) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who "is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father", according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they "kept quiet out of fear". The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from "City Press" seeking comment.
Non-payment for clothing.
Darlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R but had not received payment for them. He claims that the clothing was given to Bushiri's spokesman, Maynard Manyowa on 28 June 2019 and Bushiri has subsequently been seen wearing the clothes at public church gatherings. Ephraim Nyondo, the spokesman for the Elightened Christian Gathering church, did not dispute the claim but stated that the matter did not concern Bushiri as it was between Manyawu and Manyowa.

Radio Veritas.
The South African Catholic radio station, Radio Veritas, was reprimanded by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) for airing a one-sided programme laced with allegations against Bushiri on 1 December 2019. Bushiri had claimed that the broadcast was "malicious, damaging to his reputation, libelous, contained lies, was unfounded" and did not afford him the right of reply. The BCCSA noted that Veritas Radio had contravened the broadcasting act in not presenting the opposing view from Bushiri.
Alleged infidelity.
On 20 February 2020, former deputy finance minister of Zimbabwe, Terence Mukupe, accused Bushiri of an adulterous affair with Mukupe's musician wife, Rachel, which resulted in the impregnation of Rachel. He claimed to have WhatsApp evidence of his wife and the preacher arranging to meet for "sex romps in Malawi, Pretoria and Rustenburg". He also claimed that Bushiri had taken R (approx $) from him to finance his church, Enlightened Christian Gathering.
Bushiri responded to the allegations, saying that he had not left South Africa in the past 13 months and therefore could not have met with Rachel Mukupe. He also claimed that he had not used WhatsApp or iMessage for the past 3 years and hence could not have sent her the messages Terence Mukupe claimed to have found. Bushiri also said that he had engaged his lawyers in Zimbabwe to "urgently seek legal recours".
Mukupe's response to Bushiri was that Bushiri had not used his own phone to contact Rachel and that Mukupe had paid for the tickets for Bushiri to travel. According to reports, "Mukupe's public spat with Bushiri has divided opinion among ZANU–PF members over his psychological fitness to head the ZanuPF youth league."
On 3 March, Rachel (known as Rachel J) responded to the allegations between Bushiri and Mukupe. In her statement, released via her family, it was stated that:
On 4 March, Rachel J's family demanded a paternity test be performed on the child to prove that he was not Bushiri's.
On 6 March, Rachel gave birth to a daughter she referred to as "Najah, Deborah, Makomborero". No paternity tests had been conducted at that point.
Arrest.
On 1 February 2019, Bushiri was arrested together with his wife by South Africa's Directorate for Priority Investigations (HAWKS) for fraud and money laundering. The Hawks said the case against the couple was linked to alleged offences of fraud and money laundering, as well as the contravention of South Africa's Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA), which had been committed from 2015. The contravention of the Act was in relation to Exchange Control Regulations relating to foreign currency of $.
On 28 August 2019, Bushiri's court case was postponed until 29 November 2019 to allow his legal team, including Terrence Baloyi and Barry Roux, to make representations to the National Prosecuting Authority. The case was subsequently postponed to 27 July 2020 for trial, at which time it was postponed to October 2020.
In November 2019, application was made by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for the forfeiture of a 1984 Gulfstream aircraft owned by Bushiri and hangared at Lanseria airport, north of Johannesburg. The NPA claimed that the aircraft had been procured with funds illegally obtained. Bushiri claimed that it was legitimately acquired in 2016 for $ (R). The application for forfeiture was not ready to go ahead and was removed from the court roll.
Bushiri and his wife were each granted R (approx $) bail after appearing in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on 6 February 2019. Among the bail conditions were that the couple remain in Gauteng and their travel documents remain with the state. If they needed to travel, they would need to get written permission from investigating officers. Bushiri and wife were also not allowed to make contact with any of the witnesses.
On 20 October 2020, prior to their court appearance on 30 October 2020, the Bushiris were arrested on charges which were not included in the previous cases. Conflicting reports implicated various combinations of Landiwe Sindani, Landiwe Ntokwana, Willah Mudolo and Zethu Mudolo in the fraud case as co-accused with the Bushiris. The Bushiris are also accused of being illegally in South Africa and of having contravened the immigration regulations on several occasions since at least 2015. Their bail application was set for 30 October. The Bushiris had not been released from prison as they were considered a flight risk as evidenced by the allegations that they had illegally exported a Bentley and a Maserati to Malawi earlier in 2020.
The trial date for the fraud case was set for May 2021.
On 14 November 2020, reports surfaced that Bushiri and his wife had fled back to Malawi, breaking bail conditions due to fears for their safety. On November 20, Bushiri and his wife, who were arrested in their native country on November 18, were released from a Malawi prison after their arrest was deemed illegal.
Personal life.
Bushiri was born to a Malawian father and a Zambian mother. He is married to Mary Bushiri, who is active in charity work. They have two daughters together. On 29 March 2021, he announced the passing away of his first daughter Israella, and stated that as a father it was his desire to see her grow and serve the Lord.

The Vatuka, meaning "northerners" in Old Tamil language and also spelled Vaduga, comprise three distinct Telugu-speaking caste-based communities of what is now the state of Tamil Nadu in India. They are families who moved south to the region from Andhra following the collapse of the Vijayanagara Empire after 1565, settling in contiguous areas of Tirunelveli. Their original caste identities were as Balija, Kambalattars and Kammavars and they were once been prominent in the Vijayanagara imperial court.
The Vatuka engaged in agriculture in the arid area of Tirunelveli, perhaps because they had experience of cultivating such land but perhaps also because the other dominant group in the area - the Maravars - had already settled in the more fertile places. People such as Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Tirumala Nayaka, Maharaani Mangammal, Virupatchi Gopala Naicker are some historical leaders and kings of Tamil Nadu Nayakar Kingdoms.

Sabba da Castiglione, fra' Sabba da Castiglione or Saba da Castiglione (1480 – 16 March 1554) was an Italian Renaissance humanist, writer and member of the Knights Hospitaller.
Life.
Born into a noble family in Milan, he studied law, philosophy and theology at the University of Pavia. After a short stay in Mantua, he decided to enter the Knights Hospitaller in 1505 aged only twenty-five. He later became their deputy procurator general. He was stationed on Rhodes until 1508, when he moved to Rome, where he cultivated a love of art and literature.
He then decided to leave Rome's corruption and worldliness and between 1515 and 1519 set up home in Faenza, where he became commendatory abbot of the church of Santa Maria Maddalena on Borgo Durbecco - the church is thus still nicknamed the "Chiesa della Commenda" after him. He devoted himself to study, charity and patronage of the arts. He collected books, sculptures and artworks, founded a free public school for poor children and opened a pilgrims' hospice. In 1525 he promised to finance the restoration of the church's monastic buildings as a base for the Knights. In 1533 he commissioned Girolamo da Treviso to decorate the church's main apse with a fresco of "The Madonna Enthroned between Saints Mary Magdalene and Catherine of Alexandria". In 1554 he also commissioned a monochrome fresco from Francesco Menzocchi, an artist from Forlì - it showed St Joseph presenting Castiglione himself, now an old man, to the Virgin Mary. He also had his tomb sited under Menzocchi's fresco and wrote the Latin epitaph for the tomb.

SeneGence

SeneGence International, Inc. (also known as SGII, Inc.) is a privately owned American multi-level marketing (MLM) company that sells skincare and makeup products, including the LipSense product line. The company was founded in 1999 by Joni Rogers-Kante who is the CEO and chair. The company is headquartered in Foothill Ranch, Lake Forest, California, with facilities in Sapulpa, Oklahoma.
Business model.
SeneGence distributors (referred to as "SeneSisters") work under a multi-level marketing system, with titles based on sales numbers and rankings. Income is calculated and derived from product sales, and commissions on wholesale product purchases from recruited distributors. To qualify for earning commissions, distributors are required to spend at least $200 monthly.
An article in "The Outline" in December 2017 raised concerns about SeneGence's business model, the payment structures for independent distributors and concerns around 'front-loading' (when distributors buy potentially non-refundable large volumes of inventory either in preparedness for customer orders, or to combat product shortages). According to "The Outline", SeneGence's "complicated pay structure" may indicate that the company is close to being an illegal pyramid scheme.
"The Daily Beast" has said that multi-level marketing distributors, including those with SeneGence, have made extremely aggressive and unsupportable sales claims.
In 2017, there were widespread reports of SeneGence distributors falsely claiming that LipSense had been designated as "the official lipstick of Broadway". According to "Racked", the company has emailed distributors asking them not to make this claim, but has not challenged any distributors who ignore this request. "Racked" found no examples of any SeneGence cosmetics being used by Broadway productions.
Products.
SeneGence products include LipSense lip color, lip gloss, and lip color remover. According to "Romper", LipSense products may not be safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as they contain polyethylene glycol-related chemicals, and parabens.
Marketing.
Celebrity distributors have included actress Loretta Swit and Teen Mom 2 cast member Leah Messer. Messer received negative feedback on her instagram account regarding her use and promotion of LipSense products on her young daughters.
SeneGence sponsored Lauren Winans, a country musician from Buckhannon, West Virginia. and launched two new shades of LipSense -- 'Luv It' and 'Heartbreaker' -- named after Winans' songs "You're Gonna Luv It". and "Better at Breaking", respectively.
History.
According to Rogers-Kante (née Joni Rae Rogers), she established SeneGence after raising funds by selling a chemist's long-wear lip color product, 'Ultralux', which was later rebranded as the SeneGence product line LipSense.
The company was initially based in Newport Beach, California. According to Rogers-Kante, the company earned $1.7 million in revenue from product sales in its first year of operation and $3.8 million the following year. New regional offices were opened in Canada (Burnaby, BC) in November 2001 and Australia (Bundall, Queensland) in early 2003, and the company subsequently expanded to Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and Italy in 2011. In the United Kingdom, the products are sold under the name 'SheerSense'.
As of 2016, the company reported around 50,000 distributors. By 2018 they reported more than 500,000 distributors. The products have been reported as being sold by distributors in between 11 and 13 countries.
In 2016, SeneGence leased a 49,415 square foot property in Foothill Ranch.
In September 2016, SeneGence purchased multiple properties in or near Sapulpa, Oklahoma for a new corporate headquarters, warehouses, and office space. In October 2016 SeneGence broke ground on the new headquarters. The Kante family also purchased adjoining historical properties for further development. The facility was expected to be finished in the second or third quarter of 2018.
As at January 2018, SeneGence employed around 70 people in Sapulpa and Broken Arrow.
Political involvement.
In 2010, high-level SeneGence distributor Jeri Taylor-Swade was an active volunteer for the unsuccessful campaign of Republican nominee Sharron Angle. On 21 January 2011, Angle supported SeneGence by being a special guest for a promotional evening alongside Rogers-Kante and Taylor-Swade. Advertising for the event claimed that Angle would show how SeneGence products helped her "look great with 14-16 hour days and with numerous appearances daily" during the campaign.
In March 2017, former Oklahoma state senator Ted Fisher, who was reportedly a long-term adviser to Rogers-Kante, was appointed as the company's Economic Development Officer at the Oklahoma office.

Locomotives LVCI 116-119

Locomotives LVCI 116-119 were 0-6-0 steam locomotives of the LVCI. They were designed for hauling passenger trains.
History.
They were built in 1859 by Parent &amp; Schaken, which later became Fives-Lille, for the French army, and sent to Italy for the Second Italian War of Independence. At the end of the conflict they had been incorporated into the stock of the LVCI, a company linked to the French arm of the Rothschild Group. In 1865 the locomotives passed to the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), which assigned them the numbers 714-717. Later (probably in 1869) they were renumbered 778-781. In 1885, at the creation of the great national networks, the locomotives passed to the Rete Mediterranea, which numbered them 3948-3951. In 1905, at the time of nationalization, only 3 units arrived at the FS, which registered them as Class 397 with numbers 3971-3973.

Bala Miller

Bala Miller (1928–2003) was a Nigerian musician who was influential in the development of the highlife music scene in Nigeria.
Life.
The son of Rev Miller of Zaria, a missionary who was an early Christian convert from Hausaland. Miller was born in 1928 in Pankshin, Plateau State. He was the last son in a family of five girls and three boys. Miller's upbringing exposed him to music at an early age. He developed interest in music when his father was posted to the Holy Trinity Church in Lokoja, for the first time in his life, he saw various musical instruments within the church and its adjoining school, instruments that were purchased or handed down by the colonial militia. Miller took interest in playing the church's musical instruments, at age nine, he was in the school's band and also sang during church services.
Career.
He attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos where he was active in the school's band. While in school, he joined a Calabar Brass Band that played at street corners and in weddings. After graduation, he studied marketing and also played as a part-time member of Samuel Akpabot's band. He worked for Lever Brothers in Lagos and in the evenings played the trumpet or the cornet with Akpabots' band. When Akpabot traveled abroad, Miller formed a band with an hotelier, Laremi Cole called the West End Club after Cole's West End Hotel. However, working for Lever Brothers entailed that Miller traveled a lot, so when he was posted outside of Lagos, Miller introduced Victor Olaiya, a trumpeter and band leader in one of Bobby Benson's bands to join West End Club as band leader. They had a hit with the highlife song, "Oni dodo, oni moi moi". Chris Ajilo, a band leader in England and his friend Sammy Lartey also joined the team. They played regularly at the hotel mostly for kicks, however the band was struggling financially. But when Benson later approached Ajilo and another bandmate, Samuel Lartey to form a new band, their exit caused disruption in the band and Miller had to regroup. Luckily, Miller wrote his first major hit "Kusimilaya", the song's popularity coincided with the visit of Queen Elizabeth to Nigeria and Miller's song was performed during the queen's visit. He later composed "Kusimilaya 2", teaming with Fela Sowande and Steve Rhodes for the arrangement.
In 1956, he joined Nigerian Breweries and was posted to Kaduna, with Victor Olaiya, the leading band member, the band later became known as Victor Olaiya and the Cool Cats.
While in Northern Nigeria, Miller visited a hotel that had three bands playing, one of the bands was called Universal Band, he became a mentor to the band's members. The band later changed their name to "Sahara All-Stars", after a visit to the Lagos music scene. Miller worked for different corporations, in 1966, he worked for the Nigeria Port Authority in Lagos, there he formed the company's band, Harbours Dance Band. The new band regularly played at Island Club.
In 1973, he organized the establishment of a music school in Kano. The governor of Kano, Audu Bako was a friend of Miller and had asked Miller for input in solving juvenile delinquency within the state, Miller suggested a musical school to train young adults how to play instruments. When the school opened in 1973, Miller was appointed its first director. In 1977, Miller was involved in the development of the music programme at FESTAC 77, during the festival's preparations, he was inspired to form a new band. In March 1977, after placing ads for players, he formed Bala Miller and the Music Pyrameeds of Africa. Originally a twelve piece band that later grew to become a 28 piece big band. The band was innovative for his use of hausa lyrics in highlife composition.
In 1985, Miller had a variety show on NTA Network.

House of Cards (season 6)

The sixth and final season of "House of Cards", an American political drama television series created by Beau Willimon for Netflix, was released on November 2, 2018. Frank Pugliese and Melissa James Gibson returned as showrunners for the final season. The sixth season continues the story of recently-inaugurated, Democratic president Claire Underwood (Robin Wright), who faces new threats within and outside the White House following the death of her husband and former president Frank Underwood. Powerful elites, led by wealthy siblings Annette and Bill Shepherd (Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear), are attempting to manipulate and destroy her presidency, while Claire struggles to exert influence and escape her husband's shadow.
The sixth season marks the first of the series without Kevin Spacey, who portrayed lead character Frank Underwood. Soon after production began in October 2017, Netflix fired the actor as a result of sexual misconduct allegations made against him. Production was halted for several months while the screenplay was reworked to exclude Spacey's character. As a result, the season was reduced to eight episodes, deviating from the 13-episode format of the previous seasons.
Production.
Unannounced start and sudden shutdown.
On October 11, 2017, "The Baltimore Sun" reported that "House of Cards" had been renewed for a sixth season and that filming would begin by the end of October 2017. On October 18, 2017, production of the sixth season of "House of Cards" appeared to be already in progress, without an official renewal announcement by Netflix, when a gunman opened fire near a "House of Cards" set outside Baltimore. Production company Media Rights Capital and Netflix stated that production on the show was not affected by the shooting.
Production on the series was shut down on October 30, 2017, following sexual assault allegations towards Kevin Spacey by actor Anthony Rapp, who publicly stated that Spacey had made a sexual advance on him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old. Netflix announced its decision to cancel the series after the upcoming season, although multiple sources stated that the decision to end the series had been made prior to Rapp's accusation.
The following day, Netflix and MRC announced that production on the season would be suspended indefinitely, in order to review the current situation and to address any concerns of the cast and crew. Robin Wright strongly opposed Netflix executives who wanted to cancel the season, as she was concerned about the 2,500 people who had been involved in the production at that time and were at risk of losing their jobs. On November 3, 2017, Netflix announced that they would no longer be associated with Spacey in any capacity whatsoever.
Restarting production.
On December 4, 2017, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, announced that production would restart in 2018 with Wright in the lead, without Spacey's involvement, and revealed that the sixth and final season of the show would consist of eight episodes. "House of Cards" resumed production on January 31, and wrapped filming four months later, on May 25, 2018.
The firing of Kevin Spacey significantly affected the production process, as showrunners Frank Pugliese and Melissa Gibson had to rethink the show and come up with a conclusion for the series in a limited amount of time, taking into consideration other contractual obligations of the cast and crew. In an interview with "IndieWire", Pugliese and Gibson revealed that these changes did not represent a huge shift for many of the characters; it was the overall story that was mostly affected, which was initially intended to center on a struggle between Frank and Claire to own the White House. The showrunners also revealed that—even in his absence—Frank continues to have a big impact on the story, and noted that erasing him completely would have seemed disingenuous.
In the wake of Spacey's firing, Wright leads the sixth season of "House of Cards", with her character, Claire Underwood, having assumed the presidency at the end of the previous season. A number of returning cast members reprised their roles from previous seasons, while Alik Sakharov, who had helmed three episodes in season five, directed for the final season as well. New additions to the cast included Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear, who played Annette and Bill Shepherd, the sister-brother inheritors of an industrial conglomerate; said characters were inspired by the Koch brothers, as members of a family with the power to influence American politics. Joining them, Australian actor Cody Fern plays Annette's ambitious son Duncan Shepherd. Lane had been cast to play Claire's longtime friend prior to the firing of Spacey, with whom she had shot a number of scenes. However, as she told "IndieWire", the writers "managed to find the same trajectory for [her] character in terms of what she means to Claire."
Episodes.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
Marketing.
From March to October 2018, Netflix released various promotional material for the sixth and final season of "House of Cards". On March 4, the first teaser premiered during the 90th Academy Awards ceremony. The teaser shows Robin Wright in the Oval Office as President Claire Underwood, declaring "We're just getting started," followed by an intertitle reading "Hail to the Chief". On June 10, Netflix released two first-look images from the final season. The first photo shows Wright listening to director Alik Sakharov, and the second shows her looking straight at the camera. On July 4, the 242nd anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, a video message was posted on "House of Cards" official Twitter account, with President Claire Underwood saying, "Happy Independence Day... to me." The message is followed by the hashtag #MyTurn.
On August 7, Netflix announced that the season would be released on November 2, 2018, and unveiled key art. The poster pays homage to the promotional image for the first season of the series, as Wright strikes the Lincoln Memorial pose, like Kevin Spacey had done before her. On August 27, four images were published via a press release, which depict new cast members Diane Lane, Greg Kinnear and Cody Fern in their roles as members of the Shepherd family. A teaser trailer released on September 5, revealed the fate of Frank Underwood, portrayed by Spacey who was fired from the show, months after the conclusion of the fifth season. It is shown that Frank died in 2017, and has been buried next to his father in South Carolina. Claire visits her husband's grave and says, "I'll tell you this though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line." This speech mirrors the one Frank gives in the third season of the series, when he visits his father's grave. On September 27, Netflix released a new teaser trailer that presents several new and returning characters. Claire is shown dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, and declaring that "the reign of the middle-aged white man is over." On October 8, Netflix released the official trailer for the season, which revolves around Claire's power struggle, as she clashes with the American oligarchs and tries to forge her own path as President of the United States. On October 23, critics began publishing reviews on the season, based on advance copies of the first five episodes that they had received from Netflix, after they had signed a letter of agreement.
Reception.
Critical response.
Prior to the official release date of the season, Netflix sent the first five episodes to a number of critics, to serve as advance screeners. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 69% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.11/10. The consensus reads, ""House of Cards" folds slightly under the weight of its labyrinthian ending – thankfully Robin Wright's commanding performance is strong enough to keep it standing strong." On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Kevin Lever of "FilmEra" wrote that "with Wright at the forefront of the show now, "House of Cards" shines as it did in its early years." Lever described the production as "stellar" and the writing as "reinvigorated". He noted that the show still has the feel of previous years, but it works best when it focuses on Claire, instead of dealing with holdover pieces. David Zurawik of "The Baltimore Sun" wrote, "I love TV drama that speaks to the cultural moment the way this series does. And, as I have said over and over, #MeToo is a landmark moment." Zurawik revealed that the season primarily focuses on gender issues; "the evil of patriarchy and the stench of misogyny". He stated that the episodes exceeded his expectations, and praised the performances of Wright, Lane and Kinnear. Christopher Hooton of "The Independent" described the episodes as "slightly banal". He expressed his disappointment at the new characters that were introduced this season, and commented that "Frank Underwood has left behind not only a power vacuum but an entertainment one." Hooton noted that ever since Frank became president at the end of season two, the series has drifted directionless, and after watching the first five episodes of the final season, it still remains unclear what the show is actually about.
Negative reviews include one by Tyler Coates of "Esquire", who writes: "Kevin Spacey's absence haunts the final season of "House of Cards". Just as the show wouldn't work without Claire Underwood, it doesn't exactly work without Frank." Another by Sonia Saraiya of "Vanity Fair" writes: ""House of Cards" collapses – finally. Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders." Jack Seale of "The Guardian" rated the season 2 stars out of 5 stating, "We still need to talk about Kevin. It's impossible not to miss Spacey's presence as Robin Wright struggles to make her mark and save Netflix's first big show."
The series finale in particular was met with largely negative reviews. Scott Von Doviak of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a "C−", praising Wright's direction but criticizing the writing and the characterization of Claire during the final season. Kyle Fowle of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the episode a "D" rating, saying the ultimate flaw of the season and the finale was the large focus on Frank and Frank's legacy. Emily VanDerWerff of "Vox" gave the finale a one-and-a-half star rating out of five, saying the season "saved the worst for last".
Accolades.
For the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, Robin Wright and Michael Kelly received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, respectively.

Douglas Stenton

Douglas Stenton (born ca 1953) is a Canadian archaeologist, educator and civil servant. He served as Director of Heritage for the Nunavut Department of Culture and Heritage and played an important role in the finding of from Franklin's lost expedition of 1845.
The son of Kenneth and Margaret Stenton, he was born in Chatham, Ontario. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Windsor, a MA in anthropology from Trent University in 1980 and a PhD in anthropology from the University of Alberta in 1989. Stenton is an adjunct professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Waterloo.
He served as executive director of the Inuit Heritage Trust and was the first archaeologist working for the government of Nunavut before being named Director of Heritage in 2002. He was named to the Order of Canada in 2017 for his "enduring contributions to the preservation of Canada's northern heritage".
Stenton's team has developed facial reconstructions from the skulls of two members of Franklin's expedition in the hopes of identifying them. The team will also pursue DNA analysis. Some DNA samples apparently lacked Y chromosomes, suggesting the possibility of women disguised as men among Franklin's crew. However, a more likely explanation is deterioration of those DNA samples.

Daju kingdom

The Daju kingdom was a medieval monarchy that existed in Darfur (Sudan) from possibly the 12th–15th century. Its name stems from the Daju people, the ruling ethnic group. The Daju were eventually ousted from power by the Tunjur and the last Daju king subsequently fled to present-day Chad. The sources for the Daju kingdom are almost entirely local traditions collected in the 19th and 20th century and mentions by medieval Arab historians.
History.
According to oral traditions, the Daju arrived in Darfur from the east or south, most likely the Shendi region in Nubia. The Daju languages bear great similarity with Nobiin, matching between 10–25% of its vocabulary. Arkell claims that Daju pottery is virtually indistinguishable from that produced in the late Meroitic kingdom. Arriving in Darfur, the Daju probably supplanted the local Tora culture. The Daju established their kingdom in southern Jebel Marra, from where they also exercised their influence over the adjacent regions to the south and south-east. Since the 12th century they were mentioned by several contemporary Arab historians. The first is the Sicilian al-Idrisi, who wrote in 1154 that they flourished between the kingdom of Kanem and Nubia. The Daju were pagans and subjects of raiding by their neighbours. He also claims that they were in fact nomads breeding camels, only having two towns named "Tajuwa" and "Samna". The latter town, he claimed, was eventually destroyed by a Nubian governor. More than a century later, Ibn Sa'id writes that the Daju were now partially Islamized, while also adding that they have become vassals of Kanem. Arkell postulates that Kanem not only incorporated Darfur at this time, but even stretched as far east as the Nile Valley. This large empire eventually started to collapse after the death of Dunama Dabbalemi. The theory of a political dominance of Kanem over Darfur is, however, contested. Al-Maqrizi, who lived in the late 14th and early 15th century, repeats the information provided by Ibn Sa'id, while also adding that the Daju worked in stone and waged war against an otherwise unknown people named "Watkhu".
In the 15th century the Tunjur arrived in Darfur, where they established themselves in northern Jebel Marra and ruled simultaneously with the Daju for some time. They eventually seized power entirely under unclear circumstances, and the last Daju king, whose name is mostly given by the local traditions as Ahmad al-Daj, fled to present-day Chad, where his successors ruled as sultans of Dar Sila. The Dar Sila Daju place the migration in the early 18th century, but this would have been too late. Instead, Balfour Paul suggests the late 15th century as a more fitting date.
Government.
Rene Gros believes that the Daju kingdom was rather primitive in its organization, being based mainly on military dominance. It was only under the Tunjur that sophisticated state organization was introduced. The Daju reign is not fondly remembered in Darfur; it is equated with tyranny. The kings are remembered as pagans, ignorant and as raiders of the plains outside of Jebel Marra. It is possible that the Daju monarchs reigned as divine kings. By drawing parallels to other divine kingships in Africa, this would mean that the king would have not shown himself in public and that he would have been ascribed to have magic abilities. The title of the king was probably "Bugur", a variant of the modern Daju term "Buge" ("sultan/chief"). Each king had his own palatial residence built for him. After their death the Daju kings might have been buried near the Dereiba lakes, volcanic lakes at the top of Gebel Marra which served as places of pilgrimage and as oracles until the 20th century.
Trading and cultural relations with Medieval Nubia.
 The Jewish merchant Benjamin of Tudela wrote in the 12th century that the Nubian kingdom of Alodia maintained a trading network terminating in Zwila, Libya, suggesting that the trade route went through Darfur. Two Christian Nubian pottery sherds, datable to the mid-6th century-1100, were allegedly discovered in Ain Farah. It has been suggested that aspects of the Medieval Nubian culture, like for example the purse as part of the royal regalia, were transmitted to the Chad basin through the Darfur area.

Big Pine volcanic field

Big Pine volcanic field is a volcanic field in Inyo County, California. The volcanic field covers a surface area of within the Owens Valley east of the Sierra Nevada and consists of lava flows, one rhyolitic coulee and about 40 volcanic vents including cinder cones. Some vents are simple conical cinder cones while others are irregular scoria cones. Glaciers and former lakes have modified lava flows.
Volcanic activity in the field commenced 1.2 million years ago and was controlled by a number of faults which cross the valley. Activity continued into the Pleistocene with the youngest eruption generating cones and several lava flows about 17,000 years ago. A major road and the Los Angeles Aqueduct would be threatened if volcanic activity restarted at Big Pine.
Geography and geomorphology.
The Big Pine volcanic field (also known as Aberdeen volcanic field) lies in the Owens Valley, around Aberdeen, California and between the towns of Big Pine and Independence. U.S. Route 395 and the Owens River run through the field, the latter is dammed north of the field in the Tinemaha Reservoir.
The field covers and consists of 25 monogenetic volcanoes and about 15 further vents. The field features volcanic cones on both sides of the valley, which take the form of symmetrical cones and irregular vents; the latter are found at the valley margin while the former are located on the valley floor. Crater Mountain and Red Mountain are two cones in the field. Pyroclastic material is usually found only close to the vents. A single rhyolite coulee is also part of the field.
Around Aberdeen, lava flows from diverse vents form a large field with aa and pahoehoe forms and neatly preserved surface features. Lava flows reach lengths of and have thicknesses of and sometimes lava flows from separate cones overlap, such as in Papoose Canyon.
In the past, pluvial lakes and glaciers extended over the Owens Valley. Volcanic activity occurred at the Big Pine volcanic field during that time and was influenced by these lakes and glaciers. Owens Lake spread through much of the valley during glacial times and cut shorelines into the lava flows. Glacial material and sediment covers some lava flows, and deep wells have found buried lava flows at depths of .
The basement in the region is formed by plutonic rocks of Mesozoic age, metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks which crop out in the White Mountains and the Sierra Nevada; the valley floor is covered with alluvium. Tectonically, Owens Valley is a graben formed by the movement of the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley block with respect to the rest of North America. Farther south lies the Coso volcanic field, which is also geothermally active unlike Big Pine volcanic field.
Geologic context.
Various processes have been proposed to explain the volcanism in the Basin and Range province. These include tectonic spreading which triggered the upwelling of mantle material, convection within the mantle owing to temperature and viscosity differences, the aftereffects of Proterozoic crustal boundaries, mantle currents and release of water by the slab of the Farallon Plate and the delamination of crustal material. There are a number of volcanic fields in Eastern California and Big Pine is one of these. 
Volcanic activity at Big Pine and Coso volcanic fields is linked to the tectonic spreading of the Basin and Range province, and vents at Big Pine are associated with faults such as the Owens Valley fault, the Sierra Nevada fault and the White Mountains fault; faults have offset lava flows of the field. Seismic imaging of the crust beneath the Big Pine volcanic field indicates that the lithosphere is thinner there than elsewhere.
Composition.
The Big Pine volcanic field has erupted basaltic rocks spanning a range of composition from alkali basalt to basanite, as well as one unit of silicic rocks. Phenocrysts include olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene. The erupted rocks also contain xenoliths such as lherzolite, pyroxenite and wehrlite.
The magmas erupted in the Big Pine volcanic field were generated by melting of lithospheric mantle that had been modified by subduction processes 1.8 billion years ago. Research conducted in 2008 suggested that the mixing and melting of two origin magmas is necessary to generate the observed rock compositions. After formation, the magmas at Big Pine quickly rose to the surface, preventing the formation of rhyolites which would require the magmas to stall within the crust.
Climate and vegetation.
Owens Valley is windy and sunny with yearly temperatures fluctuating with strong diurnal temperature fluctuations. The Owens Valley lies in the rainshadow of the Sierra Nevada and thus the climate of the valley is dry with about precipitation.
Vegetation in the valley is dominated by species adapted to arid and semiarid climates and includes Alkali sacaton, big sagebrush, greasewood, Nevada saltbush, rubber rabbitbrush, salt grass and shadscale. Plants cluster in places where water is available, such as on former stream courses, around depressions and along fault lines.
Eruption history.
Volcanism at Big Pine occurred during the Quaternary and yielded a total volume of of rock. Activity lasted from 1.2 million years ago until 17,000 years ago, with the bulk of the rocks erupted between 500,000 and 100,000 years ago. Glacial isostasy seems to influence eruption rates in the field, with eruptions suppressed during glacial times.
The oldest volcanic structures, 1.2 million years old, are found in the Oak Creek area and only erosional remnants of them are encountered. The rhyolite was erupted about 990,000 years ago, while later volcanism took place from 760,800 ± 22,800 years ago in Papoose Canyon (Papoose Canyon sequence) over 469,400 ± 9,200 years ago at Jalopy Cone, 90,500 ± 17,600 years ago at Quarry Cone, 61,600 ± 23,400 years ago at Volcanic Bomb Cone, 31,800 ± 12,100 years ago at Goodale Bee Cone (Aberdeen flow), 27,000 years ago at the Blackrock Springs lava to the about 17,000 years old Armstrong Canyon/Division Creek/Taboose Creek flows. 
These (Armstrong Canyon/Division Creek/Taboose Creek) flows were erupted during the same episode, which created Armstrong Canyon cone, a series of scoria cones and the three lava flows along a long tract of the Sierra Nevada fault. This episode may have generated as much as of tephra, and lava flows interacted with water forming palagonite. The lavas from this event and the Blackrock Springs lava were later eroded by Owens Lake during its last glacial maximum highstand.
Hazards.
The volcanoes in Eastern California such as Long Valley, Coso and Big Pine are still considered hazardous. The Los Angeles Aqueduct and US. Route 395 may be impacted by future eruptions at Big Pine; the former contributes of the water supply of Los Angeles (from less than one quarter to more than half of the city's water consumption) while the latter is frequently used by people travelling between Mammoth Lakes and Los Angeles.

Life.
He was born in Vigo di Legnago, but moved to Mantua at the age of 15, and was converted to the Republican ideas of Mazzini by the Revolutions of 1848. He was one of the first people to join the Guardia Civica formed in the province. During the First Italian War of Independence he took part in the first battle of Governolo. After the battle of Novara he joined Giuseppe Garibaldi in his defence of the Roman Republic and was seriously injured during the clashes at the Villa Doria Pamphilj.
Following the Austrian Empire's amnesty in October 1849, Frattini returned to Mantua and quickly joined the Mantuan Insurrectional Committee, hiding its secret press in his home and bringing supporters of unification to Mantua from other cities in Italy. He and the other Belfiore martyrs were incriminated by Luigi Castellazzo's confession, arrested on 26 October 1852 and condemned to hang for high treason. The execution took place at Belfiore on 19 March 1853, one hour before the announcement of an amnesty for Francis Joseph I of Austria's birthday. The precise instructions to Josef Radetzky for the executions forbade him from delaying them - they had been personally set by Francis Joseph with advice from his main counsellor Karl Grünne.

<doc id="56756154" url="?curid=56756154" title="Erik d'Azevedo">
Erik d'Azevedo

Erik d'Azevedo (born 1948) is an American artist and poet who has been active in the San Francisco Bay Area art scene since the late 1970s.
Early life.
D'Azevedo was born in Oakland, California. His father, Warren, was an anthropologist and academic who founded the anthropology department at the University of Nevada, Reno. During his lifetime, Warren was acknowledged as a pioneer of the study of African art, particularly with his groundbreaking book, "The Traditional Artist in African Societies" (Indiana University Press, 1974). His mother, Kathleen, is a retired anthropologist whose scholarship focuses primarily on child psychology. When he was six years old, d'Azevedo traveled with his parents and sister to Liberia to live among the Gola people as his father conducted fieldwork for his dissertation. This experience, in addition to his father's ethnographic work on Native American Washoe culture of the Great Basin, had a profound impact on the development of Erik's worldview.
Education.
D'Azevedo initially attended the University of Nevada, Reno majoring in social sciences, although during this time he took a few art courses, notably with sculptor John McCracken, who encouraged him to leave Nevada for an art center like New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. While in Reno in the mid 1960s, he worked as a field crew member for archeological surveys in eastern Nevada.
Following McCracken's advise, he returned to the Bay Area and went on to receive a Bachelor of Fine Art degree from the California College of Arts and Craft (now California College of the Arts) in 1974, and remained at the school for graduate studies, receiving a Master of Fine Art degree in 1976. At CCAC, he studied with leading Bay Area artists such as Franklin Williams, Judith Linhares, Roy De Forest, Arthur Okamura and Jay DeFeo, whose emphasis on resisting "the hierarchy of material," resonated with him. He studied privately with DeFeo after leaving CCAC.
Artistic style and career.
Early on in his career, d'Azevedo sought to break with the conventions of abstract painting in Western art by focusing on "process painting," which encourages mindfulness and experimentation in place of traditional formalism. This approach allows for elements to develop organically, and has led to what he describes as "purposeful chaos", which references the theory established by art critic Morse Peckham in his 1965 book "Man's Rage for Chaos". Peckham writes in opposition to the commonly held notion that artists seek to create structure. Expanding this idea, d'Azevedo believes that "chaos" is a direct reaction to the "rigidity and structure" of art history and its discourse. Reflecting on his own work in a 2004 interview, he notes that although his abstract painting might seem like visual chaos, it is in fact created with a sense of order.
Experimentation is central to his work, leading him to use of a variety of media. His works range from paintings and sculptures that incorporate found objects to oil and acrylic paintings on canvas. Working with an emphasis on the spontaneity of "process," he eventually arrived at a painting technique that resembles printmaking, as he first paints an image on polyurethane then transfers it in reverse to a stretched canvas. D'Azevedo refers to this technique as "blind painting" or an "indirect" method.
When asked about the possible influence of African art and visual culture on his work as a result of his early exposure to it as a child, he has said "If that influence is there, it comes out completely unconsciously".
D'Azevedo has lived and worked in the East Bay for decades, maintaining studios in Emeryville, Berkeley, and Oakland from the mid 1970s until the early 2000s. He has exhibited in museums, galleries, and alternative art spaces since 1972, while he was still a student at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Awards and teaching.
In 1992, d'Azevedo received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, and was later awarded a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant (2000).
He taught painting at the San Francisco Art Institute in 2000, and was a guest lecturer in the literature department of St. Mary's College in Moraga, California earlier that year.
Writing.
D'Azevedo was active in the Bay Area poetry scene beginning in 1984. His poems and short stories have been featured in Ellensburg Anthology (New York) and Perspectives (New York), in addition to smaller California publications. Between 1984 and 1992, he published five volumes of poetry including "The Berkeley Diet" (1983), "Garageland: Poems 1978 - 1984" (Jaws on a Spring Press, 1984), and "Poems to Go" (Jaws on a Spring Press, 1984).
In 2012, he published a memoir of his childhood years in Liberia titled ""Vanya Da Dua" Glimpses of a Lost World: An American Boy in the Liberian Bush" (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform).

Formally established on 23 November 2000 according to Presidential Decree No. 165/2000, the PSDKP is the agency responsible for supervising the marine and fishery resources of the Republic of Indonesia. The main mission of PSDKP is the prevention of Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Indonesian waters, which has caused a substantial loss for Indonesia's fishing industry. In its mission to prevent illegal fishing, PSDKP has conducted joint-operations with the Indonesian Navy, Water Police, Sea and Coast Guard, the Maritime Security Agency and Customs. PSDKP is however is not associated with these agencies.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in Indonesian waters have caused huge losses for Indonesia. Overfishing, overcapacity, threats to the preservation of fish resources, unfavorable fishery business climate, the weakening of the competitiveness of firms and the marginalization of fishermen are the real impact of illegal fishing and destructive fishing activities. Another disadvantage that can not be assessed materially but is strongly related to the national pride, is the negative image of the Indonesian nation among the international community because it is considered not able to manage marine and fishery resources properly.

Karl Ludwig von Grünne

Karl Ludwig Grünne, Count of (Graf von) Pinchard (25 August 1808, Vienna - 15 June 1884, Baden bei Wien) was an Austro-Hungarian general.
Life.
The only son of Philipp Ferdinand von Grünne (1762-1854), he joined his father's uhlan regiment in 1828. He rose to major in 1838 and colonel and head of Archduke Stephen's court in 1843. He was a favourite of Archduchess Sophie and was thus a strong influence on the young Archduke Franz Joseph. He was appointed to the Austrian Empire's privy council in 1847 and in August the following year became obersthofmeister to Franz Joseph. On 19 October 1848 he was made a major general and when Franz Joseph became emperor on 2 December the same year, he made Grünne his chief adjutant and head of his military chancellery.
On 12 July 1850 he was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal. After Austro-Hungary was defeated in the 1859 Sardinian War, the people and the army mainly placed the blame on Grünne. The emperor wrote him a handwritten letter on 20 October 1859 dismissing him from his post as chief adjutant but making him a colonel and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Stephen. Grünne also successfully petitioned the emperor to retain his role as captain of the gendarmerie guards. He gained promotion to Cavalry General on 22 November 1864 and on 23 August 1865 was put in command of No. 1 Uhlan Regiment.
In 1865 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece and he also held the post of colonel-equerry until 3 November 1875, on which date he retired from it due to poor health. He spent the summer months of his retirement in Baden bei Wien in complete seclusion. In 1883 he was made a member of the Empire's Herrenhaus, but missed several meetings, again due to his health. He was still held in high esteem by the royal family and was visited at home by Franz Joseph, his son Crown Prince Rudolf and Rudolf's wife Stéphanie.
In his later years he separated from his wife Caroline, Countess of Trauttmansdorff-Weinsberg, whom he had married in 1831, by private arrangement rather than by a legal decision. They had three daughters and two sons - Philip became a lieutenant and Rudolph a colonel. Grünne's funeral was held in the Frauenkirche, Maria die Glorreiche in Baden bei Wien (then the court church) and his body was then buried in the family vault at Dobersberg on 19 June 1884.

Raino Parvat

Raino Parvat ( a mountain out of a mustard seed) is a 1914 Gujarati play by Ramanbhai Neelkanth (1868–1928), written with an eye on social reform attempts to bring about a synthesis of the Sanskrit and English styles of drama. It is considered a classic play of Gujarati literature. It tells a story of a gardener who become king due to the circumstances.
Background and structure.
Ramanlal was influenced by "Kanta" (1882), a Gujarati play written by Manilal Dwivedi, and decided to write a play. In 1895, he started writing "Raino Parvat" but stopped after writing the first act. He briefly worked on it in May 1909. He completed it around the end of 1913 and published it in 1914.
Ramanbhai Neelkanth fused the tradition of Sanskrit drama with Shakespearean technique in "Raino Parvat", the only play he wrote. It has 7 acts running into 36 scenes. The plot was inspired from the following couplet appearing in the "Lalji Maniar Vesha" of Bhavai, a traditional Gujarati folk play:
Characters.
Principal characters are:
Play.
Act 1.
Parvatrai, the king of Kanakpur, is concerned about the age difference with his young queen, Lilavati. He is tempted to regain his youth through the rejuvenation treatment of Jalaka, a gardener woman. He enters her garden to see a demonstration but is mistaken for an animal and killed by Rai. Jalaka and the king's bodyguard, Sitalsinh, bury the king in the garden and claim that he is in seclusion for the six-month rejuvenation treatment, leaving his minister, Kalyankam, to rule. Jalaka had been promised one-quarter of the kingdom if the treatment worked. But since Parvatrai is dead, she reveals to Rai that they are Queen Amritdevi and Prince Jagdeepdev, wife and heir of King Ratnadeepdev who Parvatrai dethroned through treachery. Rai agrees to follow his mother's wishes though he is troubled by his conscience.
Act 2.
Kalyankam and the chief of the army, Pushpasen, discuss the state of affairs. Durgesh, chief of a distant region of the state, tries to revolt but Kalyankam shrewdly promotes him as a deputy minister under his close supervision. Durgesh tries to gain the secret of Parvatrai's treatment but Jalaka withholds the information. Rai is injured falling from a horse and brought to Kayahkam's home for treatment. Kalyankam and his wife, Savitri, arrange a marriage between Pushpasen's daughter, Kamala, and Durgesh.
Act 3.
Durgesh, Kamala and Rai travel in disguise to learn how people view the king's rejuvenation experiment. They meet a monk who is displeased with it. Then they come across a group of people wearing mirrors on their bodies who sing that Old Parvatrai removed the mirrors from the palace, and when he is young they want him to return the mirrors to the kingdom. The men in the street remark that they are more concerned with the king's heart than his body, as they want a good king whether old or young. Someone makes a disparaging remark about a woman, which enrages Kamala, dressed as a man, but Durgesh intervenes to stop her attack. After returning home, Rai and Durgesh vow to campaign against the low status of women in the kingdom.
Act 4.
Rai had agreed to act as the rejuvenated king. Sitalsinh secretly takes him to see important places and gain familiarity with Parvatrai's life. He is brought to spy on Lilavati's chambers, where she is eager to lovingly receive her husband. Rai realizes with some shock that becoming king means he will become Lilavati's husband, and feels this to be utterly immoral and unjust. After brief consideration, he decides to give up his right to become Parvatrai's successor.
Act 5.
Six months have passed and a royal procession moves through the streets. Savitri and Kamala try to compare the young king to the Parvatrai they remembered, but are surprised that the new king looks like Rai. He enters the Prabhapunj palace where Queen Lilavati lovingly welcomes him but he refuses her embrace. Rai reveals that he is Prince Jagdeep and explains what happened. Lilavati faints and Rai helps her regain consciousness, respectfully addressing her as queen mother. Unaware of this, Jalaka offers flowers for Lilavati's chambers and is brutally attacked by Lilavati, who curses her: "never ever shall ye be queen, and you shall meet death as "malan" [] with a broken heart like mine." When Rai is crowned as king Parvatrai, he discloses to the court his real identity and asks the people and courtiers to decide the succession within a fortnight, during which time he will withdraw from the city.
Act 6.
Jagdeep is wandering when he saves a woman from a boat mishap on the riverbank. The woman is Vinavati, Parvatrai's daughter who has lived in seclusion since becoming a widow. She falls in love with Jagdeep at first sight and he is enamoured of her. Durgesh acts as a go-between and Vinavati's maid, Rekha, tells of her past history. Jagdeep kisses Vinavati's finger in place of a ring, as a token of his love, and departs.
Act 7.
Sitalsinh, with the help of Lilavati's maid, Manjari, conspires to persuade Lilavati to adopt his son as heir of the crown, but the scheme fails miserably. Jalaka has become despondent and ultimately dies. Jagdeep is elected as Pravatrai's successor and installed as king with Vinavati as the queen.
Criticism.
Ramanlal Joshi noted that the handling of dramatic situations, characterization, dialogues, and depiction of lofty sentiments make this play a classical work. However, the play has been criticized for its long drawn-out sequence which is not suitable for the stage. Bipin Jhaveri wrote "Raino Parvatni Samiksha" ("Criticism of Raino Parvat") which was an expansion of his Ph.D. thesis submitted in 1950. Anantrai Raval also published "Raino Parvat: Vivechan" (Criticism of Raino Parvat) in 1938, reprinted in 1957.
Several critics noted that: "Ramanbhai Nilkanth, a follower of Prarthana Samaj, asserts his social reformer's signature by arranging Rai's marriage with Vinavati, a widow, in the last two acts which ultimately weakens its plot.
Performance history.
Possibly on 14 March 1915, the play was first performed by Gujarati Amateurs Group of Grant Medical College under the leadership of Manubhai, son of Nanalal Dalpatram. The play was split in three acts and it included two songs and a "shloka", written by Narsinhrao Divetia. The second performance was held in Ahmedabad in 1926 and was directed by Bapulal Nayak, a Mumbai based actor and director of Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali. Jaishankar Sundari played the role of Lilavati in it while the role of Rai was played by Bapulal himself. In 1948, under the guidance of Jaishankar Sundari and Jashvant Thakkar, the students of Gujarat Vidhya Sabha performed "Raino Parvat" for the centenary of the institution. In this performance, Vinodini Nilkanth, daughter of Ramanbhai Neelkanth, played the role of Jalka.

Deportivo Alavés C

Deportivo Alavés C, S.A.D., usually known as Alavés C, was a Spanish football team based in Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the autonomous community of Basque Country. Founded in 1980 as "AD Zaldiaran", it was the second reserve team of Deportivo Alavés.
The team's home kit was blue and white-striped shirt, blue shorts and white socks.
History.
In 2000, "AD Zaldiaran" (founded 1980), a small club from Vitoria-Gasteiz which had just been promoted to Tercera División was fully incorporated as "Deportivo Alavés C" and competed in the fourth tier for three seasons until 2002–03.
Thereafter a four-year partnership was agreed with another local team, Club San Ignacio (previously associated with Real Sociedad and the formative club of Spain international forward Ernesto Valverde). The affiliate became known as "Alavés C-San Ignacio" maintaining the Alavés name but playing in San Ignacio colours and usually hosting fixtures at their home ground Adurtzabal. When this entity was relegated in 2004–05, the Alavés link was discontinued.
San Ignacio continued operating independently and have since returned to the Tercera level twice (on each occasion their opponents included the other reserve side of Alavés, with both teams being relegated in 2008–09).

2018 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific "All-America" and typically referred to as "All-American athletes", or simply "All-Americans". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the "Sporting News" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.
The Consensus 2018 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn "consensus" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.
Although the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo! Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.

County of Montone

The County of Montone was a noble fiefdom in Italy, formed of the town of Montone and its territory. That territory was turned into a county by Antipope John XXIII on 28 August 1414 and granted by him to Braccio da Montone, a condottiero. Pope Martin V refounded it and on Braccio's death in 1424 confirmed it to Braccio's son Carlo. It was under the jurisdiction of the Papal States until 1519, when pope Leo X granted it to Vitello Vitelli, a member of the Vitelli family of Città di Castello. That family held it until 1573 and then from 1598 to 1646, when their line went extinct.

WWE Greatest Royal Rumble

WWE Greatest Royal Rumble was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event and WWE Network event promoted by WWE for their Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event was the first in a series of WWE events held in Saudi Arabia. The event was held on April 27, 2018 at the King Abdullah Sports City's King Abdullah International Stadium in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. At the event, all men's main roster championships were defended, in addition to a 50-man Royal Rumble match. 
The card comprised ten matches. In the main event, Braun Strowman won the Greatest Royal Rumble match to win the WWE Greatest Royal Rumble Trophy and Championship. In the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar retained the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match. In other prominent matches, the WWE Championship match between defending champion AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura resulted in a double countout, The Undertaker defeated Rusev in a casket match, and John Cena defeated Triple H in the opening match. It was also the last appearance of Chris Jericho who walked out of WWE later that year.
Production.
Background.
Since 1988, the Royal Rumble has been an annual January event held by WWE, shown on pay-per-view since 1989. The event is highlighted by the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. The Greatest Royal Rumble included the largest version of the match to date, aptly named the Greatest Royal Rumble match, having a total of 50 participants, ousting the 2011 Royal Rumble's 40-man match.
On March 5, 2018, WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority advertised the Greatest Royal Rumble, a live event to be held on April 27, 2018, at King Abdullah International Stadium, part of the King Abdullah Sports City, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The event was the first in a 10-year strategic multi-platform partnership between WWE and the Saudi General Sports Authority in support of Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia's social and economic reform program.
On March 19, 2018, WWE scheduled matches for all seven of their main roster male championships at the time: the Universal Championship, WWE Championship, Intercontinental Championship, United States Championship, Raw Tag Team Championship, SmackDown Tag Team Championship, and WWE Cruiserweight Championship. As revealed on March 22, 2018, the event was streamed live on the WWE Network. It also aired on traditional pay-per-view in the United States and internationally. The event was also the first WWE pay-per-view with Arabic commentary.
In the weeks leading up to the event, the WWE held tryouts in Saudi Arabia. From these tryouts, eight were selected to receive training by WWE, which would include an opportunity to earn a spot at the Greatest Royal Rumble event itself.
Storylines.
The card comprised ten matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, "Monday Night Raw", "SmackDown Live", and the cruiserweight-exclusive "205 Live".
On April 9, Brock Lesnar, who had renewed his WWE contract, was scheduled to defend the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match as a rematch from WrestleMania 34. On the "Raw" following WrestleMania, Reigns expressed frustration about not being told about his future matches and opponents, singling out the steel cage match with Lesnar. Reigns alleged that there was a conspiracy against him. Samoa Joe, who had been out with an injury since January, came out and warned Reigns that Lesnar would beat him again.
On March 26, WWE scheduled a ladder match between then-champion The Miz, Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, and Samoa Joe for the Intercontinental Championship. At WrestleMania 34, The Miz lost the Intercontinental Championship to Rollins in a triple threat match that also included Bálor, thus making Rollins the defending champion. Both Miz and Joe were traded to SmackDown while Rollins and Bálor remained on Raw.
On March 26, Cesaro and Sheamus were scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy). At WrestleMania 34, however, Cesaro and Sheamus lost the titles to Braun Strowman and 10-year-old Nicholas. The following night on "Raw", Strowman and Nicholas relinquished the titles due to Nicholas being a fourth grader. Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back, but Raw General Manager Kurt Angle instead scheduled them to face the winner of the four-team Tag Team Eliminator tournament for the vacant titles at the Greatest Royal Rumble. "Woken" Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt won the tournament by defeating Titus Worldwide (Apollo Crews and Titus O'Neil) and The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson). Cesaro and Sheamus were then traded to SmackDown during the Superstar Shake-up.
At WrestleMania 34, The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) defeated defending champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day's Big E and Kofi Kingston in a triple threat tag team match to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On the following "SmackDown", The Usos defeated The New Day to earn a title match at Greatest Royal Rumble.
A match between John Cena and Triple H was scheduled on March 26. 
The Undertaker was originally scheduled to face Rusev in a casket match, the first match of its kind in three years. Due to reasons not entirely clear, Rusev was temporarily replaced by Chris Jericho — this was explained with Rusev's wife Lana complaining about her husband competing in a casket match — but eventually reinserted back into the match. Jericho was restored to his original participation in the Greatest Royal Rumble match.
At WrestleMania 34, Jinder Mahal won the United States Championship. Mahal was then traded to Raw and lost the championship to Jeff Hardy and Mahal invoked his rematch clause for the Greatest Royal Rumble. Hardy was then traded to SmackDown the following night.
At WrestleMania 34, AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. After the match, Nakamura showed his respect to Styles but then attacked him with a low blow and a "Kinshasa", turning heel. On April 17, after repeated attacks on Styles by Nakamura, a rematch between the two was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble.
On the WrestleMania 34 pre-show, Cedric Alexander defeated Mustafa Ali in the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament final to win the vacant title. Two nights later on "205 Live", Buddy Murphy attacked Alexander during his celebration. Murphy was then scheduled to face Alexander for the title at the Greatest Royal Rumble, but he failed his mandatory weigh-in when he weighed 207 pounds, 2 pounds over the 205 pound weight limit. He was then removed from the match and banned from competing on "205 Live" until he met the weight requirement. The following week, Kalisto earned a Cruiserweight Championship match at the Greatest Royal Rumble by winning a gauntlet match.
Event.
Preliminary matches.
The actual pay-per-view opened with John Cena facing Triple H. During the match, Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Triple H for a near-fall. Cena attempted another Attitude Adjustment but Triple H countered into a Pedigree for a near-fall. In the end, Cena performed a second Attitude Adjustment on Triple H, a catapult into the corner, and a third Attitude Adjustment to pick up the victory. Following the match, Cena thanked the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for their hospitality, and expressed excitement over the event.
In the following match, Cedric Alexander defended the Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. The match ended when Alexander countered a Salida Del Sol attempt into a Lumbar Check to retain the title.
Next, the vacant Raw Tag Team Championship was contested between the team of Bray Wyatt and Matt Hardy and the former champions, Cesaro and Sheamus. In the end, Hardy distracted Sheamus, allowing Wyatt to perform a Sister Abigail on him. Hardy and Wyatt then performed a wheelbarrow Twist of Fate on Sheamus to win the titles.
Jeff Hardy then defended the United States Championship against Jinder Mahal. Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb on Mahal to retain the title.
After that, The Bludgeon Brothers defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos. Harper and Rowan retained the titles after performing The Reckoning on Jimmy Uso.
Next, Seth Rollins defended the Intercontinental Championship against Finn Balor, Samoa Joe and The Miz in a Ladder match. Near the end of the match, Balor attempted to retrieve the title, only for Rollins to springboard onto the ladder and retrieve the title belt, thus retaining the championship.
In a segment between matches, four prospects from the recent Saudi tryouts (including Mansoor) came out to the ring to introduce themselves. Cruiserweight Ariya Daivari and his brother Shawn Daivari, in his first WWE appearance since 2007, came out to interrupt them. The Saudi prospects attacked and cleared the Daivari brothers from the ring.
Later, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Nakamura resorted to various illegal tactics, such as a low blow, increasingly frustrating Styles. In the end, both Nakamura and Styles fought outside of the ring, only for the match to end in a double countout. After the match, Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm to the floor on Nakamura.
After that, The Undertaker fought Rusev (who was accompanied by Aiden English) in a Casket match. At the end of the match, Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Rusev and rolled him into the casket. Before Undertaker could close the casket, English attacked Undertaker, who retaliated with another chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before putting English into the casket alongside Rusev and closing it for the victory.
In the penultimate match, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a steel cage match. Reigns performed three spears on Lesnar for a near-fall. As Reigns tried to escape through the door, Heyman pushed the door into Reigns, allowing Lesnar to execute an F5 on Reigns for a near-fall. In the end, Reigns performed a Spear through the cage wall on Lesnar. Despite Reigns touching the floor first, the referee awarded the win to Lesnar, thereby retaining the Universal Championship.
Main event.
Daniel Bryan and Dolph Ziggler began the 50-man Royal Rumble match as the first two entrants. Bryan survived until the final three, beating Rey Mysterio for the longest time spent in a single Royal Rumble match of all time at an hour and sixteen minutes. In the end, Big Cass eliminated Bryan and attempted a big boot on Braun Strowman, who countered and eliminated Cass to win the match. Strowman also achieved the most eliminations of a single Royal Rumble match at 13, beating out a record previously held by Roman Reigns with 12. Post-match, Strowman received a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship.
Controversy.
WWE had been criticized for holding the event without female wrestlers, who were unable to perform at the event due to the limited rights women have in Saudi Arabia. Triple H, WWE's Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events and Creative, responded to the criticism: "I understand that people are questioning it, but you have to understand that every culture is different and just because you don’t agree with a certain aspect of it, it doesn’t mean it’s not a relevant culture...You can’t dictate to a country or a religion about how they handle things but, having said that, WWE is at the forefront of a women’s evolution in the world and what you can’t do is effect change anywhere by staying away from it...While women are not competing in the event, we have had discussions about that and hope that, in the next few years they will be". Women were in attendance for the event, though only if accompanied by a male guardian. This was a major change from previous events, which were only open to men. Associated Press noted that this is due to "a series of social changes" by the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. During the event, WWE aired a promotional video, which included WWE female wrestlers. The Saudi General Sports Authority issued an apology for "indecent material" that aired at the event.
In addition to the women, wrestler Sami Zayn did not participate in the event as Zayn is of Syrian descent, and Saudi Arabia has strained relations with Syria. On the Raw after the event, a storyline excuse was given in where Sami was suffering from vertigo given to him by Bobby Lashley and therefore couldn't compete.
Another subject of criticism was the situation of LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia, as in Saudi Arabia homosexual intercourse is illegal and can be punished by death.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a militant group offshoot of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, issued a warning to bin Salman and criticized the WWE event stating that "Disbelieving wrestlers exposed their privates and on most of them was the sign of the cross, in front of a mixed gathering of young Muslim men and women. The corruptors did not stop at that, for every night musical concerts are being announced, as well as movies and circus shows."
Results.

Championship belt.
At the conclusion of the Greatest Royal Rumble, Braun Strowman was awarded a trophy and the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship. According to "The Sportster", "the likelihood is that nothing that took place in the main event will have any effect on anything once WWE arrives back in the United States and resume normal service." Although WWE.com had originally listed Strowman as the Greatest Royal Rumble Champion after the event, he never appeared with the championship at any other event and the title was never mentioned again.
The base design was similar to the current design of the WWE Championship introduced in 2014, with some differences. Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate was modeled with an Arabic pattern with the WWE logo in the center. Like the WWE Championship belt and other belts introduced since 2016, the Greatest Royal Rumble Championship belt contained two side plates, both separated by gold divider bars, with removable round sections that could be replaced with the current champion's logo; the default plates showed the official logo of Saudi General Sports Authority, which is identical to the national emblem of Saudi Arabia. The plates were on a green leather strap resembling the color of the national flag of Saudi Arabia.

St Paul's Church, Weymouth

St Paul's Church is a Church of England parish church in Westham, Weymouth, Dorset, England. Designed by George Fellowes Prynne, the bulk of the church was built in 1894-96. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1974, with the World War I memorial outside also designated Grade II in 2016. In their book "The Buildings of England: Dorset", John Newman and Nikolaus Pevsner noted the church's "idiosyncratic but convincing design".
History.
St Paul's was built to serve the residents of Westham, which developed as a new suburb of Weymouth in the late 19th century. A chapel of ease to All Saints was first erected to serve Westham in 1880. By 1892, the suburb's population had passed 2,000 and the existing church accommodation became inadequate. A meeting was held at Weymouth Guildhall in June 1892, chaired by the Bishop of Salisbury, which determined that a new church should be erected. A committee was formed to raise funds and a site opposite the church purchased for £655. In 1893, a limited competition was held for architects to send their designs for the church and that of George Fellowes Prynne was selected in favour of two other schemes.
Enough funds had been raised to allow construction to begin in 1894, with Mr. W. H. Gooding of Exeter hired as the builder and Mr. R. Ramm as clerk of the works. The foundation stone was laid by the Countess of Hoyos on 9 May 1894. The ceremony was attended by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Weymouth Mayor and Corporation, members of the local clergy and the public. As further funds were required before the entire church could be built, the initial agreement was for enough of the building to be built to provide accommodation for 400 persons. As work progressed, problems emerged with the contractor when it was realised the church could not be completed by the time specified and contracted for. Work was temporarily halted but recommenced when Prynne took over the project himself, with Mr. C. Foad as clerk of the works.
The contracted work was completed in 1896 and St Paul's was dedicated by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev. John Wordsworth, on 25 January 1896. It included two bays of the nave, north aisle, south transept, chancel, vestries and organ chamber, along with the permanent foundation of the whole church. A third bay of the nave, at the west end, was also erected as a temporary section. At the time, £5,600 had been spent on the church and land, £1,850 of which had still to be raised. In the following years, the committee continued to raise funds and the debt was reduced to £600 by 1900.
In May 1900, a meeting was held at the Royal Hotel in Weymouth to discuss the proposed consecration of the church and the formation of a separate parish from Wyke Regis. The Bishop of Salisbury offered to consecrate the church on 18 October 1900 if the debt was reduced to £300 by the beginning of that month and if the architect of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners certified St Paul's "structurally sufficient" as a parish church. £450 was successfully raised and the Bishop of Salisbury consecrated the church on 18 October 1900. Westham became its own parish, with St Paul's as the parish church, in 1902. A side chapel was added to the church in 1903 and all permanent work completed in 1913.

Juan Francisco Machado was the governor of the then Spanish colony Trinidad from 1781 to 1784.
In the late 18th century Trinidad was subordinated administratively to the intendant of Caracas. Machado's predecessor, military governor Rafael Delgado, had been dismissed for incompetence by intendant José de Abalos after a political affair. On March 31, 1781 Machado was appointed as Delgados successor. Delgado's mandate was affected by constant quarrelling with civil governor Martín de Salaverría about competences. This condition continued seamlessly during Machado's short term. In October 1783 the term of civil governor de Salaverría ended, and the Spanish government appointed José María Chacón as his successor. Chacón was supposed to be the first governor since 1779 to be civil and military governor in unison. Since Chacón had to travel to Trinidad first and didn't arrive until August 1784, Machado was appointed civil governor as well on October 18, 1783. In January 1784 (June 1784 according to a different source) Machado was dismissed by then acting intendant Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis, and Antonio Barreto was appointed governor of Trinidad until Chacón's arrival. Machado protested unavailingly against his dismissal.

Lentorata

The Lentorata ('Flight track') is a planned railway line in Finland, designed to link Helsinki Airport to the Finnish long-distance railway network and to complement the current airport connection via the Ring Rail Line. Construction of the line is not expected to start until 2030, with the line operational several years later.
History.
The "Lentorata" has been included in the Finnish Transport Agency's plans since 2010. Following the opening of the Ring Rail Line in 2015, Helsinki Airport gained its first railway connection through the Helsinki commuter rail network. However, a need has also been identified for a rail link to long distance traffic, with support from Finavia, the mayors of Helsinki and Tampere and the chief executive of the state-owned national rail company VR Group.
Route.
The line is planned to travel in a long tunnel under built-up areas and to serve the underground Helsinki Airport station, allowing direct access to the airport terminal from long-distance rail services, as well as to free the rail capacity taken up by long-distance traffic in the current main corridor (the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway) for the increasing local commuter traffic. The tunnel would surface at Kerava railway station, and the line would then continue northward to Tampere as either an upgraded Riihimäki–Tampere railway or a brand new parallel line; and eastward to Kouvola using the planned new Itärata railway.
Cost.
In 2019, "Helsinki Times" reported that, as part of a new rail connection with an expected travel time of one hour from Helsinki to Tampere via the airport, the project would cost a total of €5.5 billion.

The group's prime intent and focus is embedded on anti-governmental and organization cyber protests within current involvements of media speculation and real life happenings in 2016 to present.They are also a team in and part of the hacktivist group Anonymous.
List of attacks on governments and organizations.
Defacements of the Ethiopian government.
In January 2016, GSH started its very first attacks by the defacing of Ethiopian government websites in response to the killing of nearly 500 students and activists by Ethiopian Security Forces during protests that became extremely violent was involved in the latter part of 2015 and then sparked again between August and October in 2016 Ethiopian protests.
Attacks on Donald Trump.
On May 21, 2016 GSH targeted Donald Trump's official website by launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks for what they saw as racist comments made towards refugees and Mexicans. Shortly after targeting Trump's official website GSH shut down Trump's hotel collection websites.
Attacks on the Israeli Defense Force.
The group gained more notoriety after having successfully leaked data of the Israeli Defense Force on April 7, 2016. This was the day #OpIsrael was launched along with Anonymous, leaking the Database of Israel Defense Force posting thousands of IDF soldiers, border patrol, and Israeli Air Force personnel information online.
Attacks on the Ku Klux Klan.
On April 23, 2016 GSH targeted the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan by taking their websites down in the protest of racism while Anonymous vs. KKK protests were happening in the state of Georgia, U.S.A.
Attacks on Black Lives Matter.
In 2016, GSH took down the official website of Black Lives Matter, claiming the organization fueled further racism."" 
Attacks on Banks.
GSH and Anonymous worked in correlation together when "Operation Icarus" was first launched in February 2016. The op was aimed at attacking the central banking system which the attackers accused the banks with corruption and wanted to raise public awareness. This attack sparked the invitation of more hacking teams and affiliations of Anonymous to focus their attention towards that of the Central Banks in direct regards of further scrutiny and cyber attacks.
"Ghost Squad Hacker's" leader s1ege claimed responsibility for the attacks which were carried out on the Bank of England email server and dozens of other banking websites including the New York Stock Exchange, Bank of France, Bank of Greece, Bank of Jordan and the Bank of South Korea, among others. s1ege went on to state that they want to "start an online revolution" to retaliate against the "elite banking cartels putting the world in a perpetual state of chaos." Hundreds of banks were targeted in this operation and to this day the exact number of banks affected is unknown.
Attacks on CNN, Fox News.
Notoriety of the group continued to escalate as the heat was turned up during the month of June, 2016. After censoring of media coverage in regards to OpIsrael, OpSilence was initiated targeting mainstream media outlets such as CNN and Fox News.
Data leakage of the U.S Armed Forces/Military.
A data dump was later leaked after hacking the United States Military personnel files and releasing information on close to 2,437 army personnel. The information contained in the link was uploaded to an onion link on the dark web along with a paste-bin link which contained credit card numbers and personal information on U.S. Army personnel.
Defacement of Baton Rouge City government website.
July 19, 2016 the sub domain of Baton Rouge City government website was hacked twice in one day by GSH after previously making news after attack towards both the KKK and BLM. These attacks however were targeting the City of Baton Rouge, Louisiana in protest against police brutality in which a city native Alton Sterling was shot and killed by Baton Rouge police officers on the 5th earlier that month. The Baton Rouge website was defaced along with a picture of Alton Sterling with a message that read, "Being black is not a crime! This is for the shooting of Alton Sterling, just because he's black does not mean he is a bad guy. You will pay. We are the justice. We are Ghost Squad Hackers. /R.I.P. Alton Sterling.
Attacks on the Afghanistan government and its officials.
Later in the same month GSH took over the official Twitter account of Afghanistan's Chief Executive Dr. Abdullah Abdullah in an effort to raise awareness against corruption and alleged drug deals between Afghanistan and the U.S. They also targeted the Afghan Public Credit Registry website by defacing it which also further allowed them access to several social media accounts including Dr. Abdullah's in which they tweeted,
"Afghanistan Gov Hacked by GhostSquadHackers #CheifExecutiveOfficer Can you hear me now? twitter.com/afgexecutive. We found an exploit in the government server and pulled every login we could. We have more also but Dr. Abdullah was not using phone restriction and 2FA was not enabled".
The attacks on the Afghan government continued relentlessly on the first of September after prior targeting of Afghanistan's Chief Executive Twitter account, GSH further assaulted the government by defacing twelve websites in one day all of which were affiliated with the Afghan government. This included the Afghanistan's Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, and the Afghan Attorney General's Office. Further assaults continued in hopes of raising awareness for Palestine as part of OpSilence and OpIsrael after shutting down the Israeli Prime Minister and the Bank of Israel.
Operation Decrypt ISIS.
The group's focus in 2017 shifted slightly towards targeting ISIS and removing them off the internet and social media completely. A multitude of accounts from Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram alike were hacked and added to an extensive list of ISIS removed. Further efforts by GSH later revealed bomb instructions and plans to be carried out by ISIS.
s1ege stated "We really do not care about attacking the U.S. elections. They've already been hacked. We mostly hack ISIS" in an interview with CBS news in the year 2018.
On February 12, 2019 s1ege released a massive leak on Islamic State Telegram and WhatsApp group's/channel's administrators. The leak included hacked phones/mobile devices, hacked Telegram accounts, hacked Facebook's, hacked Twitter accounts, credit cards, geolocation data, government issued ID cards, and IP logs belonging to the administrators. The group successfully infiltrated the Islamic state community on encrypted communication applications and exposed the administrators by using malware and exploits. The leak was published on mega.nz and Ghost Squad Hackers Official Twitter account. One of the Telegram and WhatsApp Admins (Riffat Mahmood Khan) was a former taxi driver living in Auburn was linked to ISIS and accused of administering the group's encrypted messages. He traveled to Syria in support of the Islamic State in 2015. He returned from the conflict zone via Turkey six months later, and was promptly picked up by Australian Federal Police officers at the airport as he flew in, in September 2015. Video footage from the raids obtained by "The Herald" showed his wife and the children being led away from the home by uniformed police, while officers swarm on the Auburn home. He is believed to not have actually participated in the fighting in Syria, but spent time there with the radical group before returning and allegedly continuing his work for the Caliphate. The man remained involved with the Islamic State's encrypted online messaging and continued to take care of the WhatsApp and Telegram groups that the radical Islamic group uses to communicate internally and for recruiting. Documents leaked by GSH showed that several of the accused ISIS supporter's children were enrolled in local Islamic school Al Bayan. He attended South Granville mosque Al Noor, where some sources suggest he became radicalized. Images from his hacked phone exposed by GSH depicted the ISIS flag flying above Venice, explosions, blood-stained knives, children brandishing ISIS flags, a meme saying 'One bullet away from Paradise' and critically wounded soldiers. Leaked data from GSH showed one Belgian (Siraj El Moussaoui), known to be an ISIS supporter, had a video on his phone about how to most effectively behead someone. Siraj El Moussaoui tried in vain to join the Islamic State in 2016 and was arrested shortly after on suspicion of plotting an attack in Belgium.
Defacements of the Indian Government.
There's been a large number of defacements to government sites as well as root ownership of an Indian Government server and also leaked data from the Australian government. Cited attacks in April 2020 included places such as Australia, India and various other governments. The Twitter feed of "GSH" has shared a multitude of alleged attacks on various government websites during the pandemic using hashtags associated with previous campaigns of "#FreeJulianAssange".
In June the group claimed responsibility for the hacking of other Indian government websites in protest against the internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir.
GSH gave warning in a LiveWire interview saying “To the people of Jammu and Kashmir, we will support your efforts and continue to back you through this pandemic and tyrannical government's grip. If India's government is persistent, we will be more persistent and consistent. No region/state/ethnic group should not have access to the internet, not even limited access. These are basic civil rights and liberties.”
Defacements of the European Space Agency (ESA).
The group defaced the European Space Agency (ESA) website https://business.esa.int in July of this year. GSH claimed the attack was just for fun. They explained that they exploited a server-side request forgery (SSRF) remote code execution vulnerability in the server, then they gained access to the "business.esa.int" server and defaced it. Having no interest in leaking any data their intent was solely to show the server was vulnerable. Within a week of hacking the business domain of the ESA they defaced the https://space4rail.esa.int website as well.
Defacements of Idaho State websites.
Later in the month of July on the 27th GSH successfully targeted Idaho state websites servers locking agencies out of their own servers. Idaho Government websites targeted included the Idaho supreme court, Idaho court, Idaho Parks and Recreation, Idaho STEM Action Center, and were victims to the group. The sites were used to broadcast messages referencing Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who was charged with violating the Espionage Act. The messages read "“Free Julian Assange! Journalism is not a crime.”"
Data leakage on various Sheriff/Police departments.
September 3, 2020 - GSH claimed responsibility for the breach of the Vermont Sheriff's Association, which resulted in a data leak of names, addresses, financial data and communications between/to various Vermont sheriffs. The leaked data was published in retaliation to the shootings of various individuals who fell victim to police brutality; including George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Breonna Taylor.

Delia Zamudio

Delia Rosa Zamudio Palacios (born 1943) is an Afro-Peruvian trade unionist and leader in the activism for the rights of Afro-Peruvian women. She was the first woman to become the head of the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (). She has worked since the 1970s to improve the human and civil rights of Afro-Peruvians and working women. As a founder of the "Casa de Refugio San Juan de Lurigancho" she has worked to assist victims of domestic and sexual violence. She was recognized by the Ministry of Culture for her contributions with the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award in 2014.
Early life.
Delia Rosa Zamudio Palacios was born in 1943, on the hacienda “Hoja Redonda” in the Chincha Province of Peru to Victoria Palacios and Grimaldo Zamudio. In the 1950s, her mother migrated with her children to the La Victoria District of Lima in search of employment. After completing the third grade, Zamudio stopped attending school to care for her younger siblings to enable her mother to work. At twelve, she began working as a domestic laborer and three years later began working at the Libertad Canning Factory in the Rímac District. Simultaneously while working during the day, Zamudio returned to school and completed her primary education. In 1966, she was hired at a pharmaceutical factory and joined the union. Within three years, she was elected as the social assistance secretary of the factory union. Continuing her night studies, Zamudio completed her secondary education at the Escuela María Parado de Bellido in Rímac in 1971.
Activism.
Zamudio's struggle for her education and to earn a livable wage, as a poor black woman in a predominantly Latino culture, led her into activism. In 1970, she became a representative of the "Federation of Laboratories, Drug Stores and Affiliates" and began participating as a delegate in conventions. Openly critical of President Juan Velasco Alvarado's military regime, she attended the 1974 Convention of Industrial Communities to protest the government. Becoming a member of the Revolutionary Worker's Party (RWP), in 1975, she was selected as the secretary-general of the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (). Her election was the first time a woman or Afro-Peruvian had headed a trade organization in Peru. The CGTP is an umbrella organization of labor unions in Peru and during her tenure through 1980 as the head of the confederation, Zamudio fought for the rights of women workers. In 1977, the union held protests demanding social and political rights and Zamudio was one of those involved in the national strike. She was selected by RWP as a provisional candidate to the 1978 Constituent Assembly, but as a result of her activism, she was replaced by another candidate and lost her job.
In 1981, Zamudio was a delegate to the Convention of Mexican Laborers and the following year became secretary for women's concerns in the CGTP. In addition to her labor activism, Zamudio attended women’s rights conferences, like the Latin American Feminist Conferences held in Brazil and Mexico in 1986, as well as the 1990 Fifth Argentine Feminist Conference of Buenos Aires. Preferring to work in grassroots organizations because of the paternalistic attitude of more formal women's NGOs, Zamudio's activism focused on training and protection for working-class women. She worked with the Organizing Commission of Peruvian Women (COMUP), to evaluate problems facing women in the work force, looking at maternity rights and sexual harassment, though the proposals did not become law until the 1999 passage of Law 27240 concerning maternity and the 2003 adoption of Law 27942 regarding sexual harassment.
In the mid-1990s, when the Peruvian economy became restricted, Zamudio again lost her job and worked from a small shop in her home. In 1995, a testimonial of her life "Piel de mujer" (Woman's Skin) was published, describing what it was like to grow up as a poor, black woman with limited opportunities and how through activism and helping others, she overcame the physical and emotional abuse, racism and discrimination she faced by helping others. She founded a women's shelter, the San Juan de Lurigancho House of Refuge (), to assist women and children fleeing domestic violence in her neighborhood. Continuing her advocacy for Afro-Peruvians, she works with the Ministry of Women in the Afro-Peruvian Labor Bureau to address concerns of working women. In 2014 on International Women's Day, Zamudio was one of the honorees of the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award for her human rights work. Her testimony was republished in 2016 by the LUNDU Center for the Afro-Peruvian Study and Promotion () in a compilation which included forty case studies of violence against women of African descent in Peru.

Bill Steigerwald

Bill Steigerwald is a Pittsburgh-born author and journalist who worked as an editor and writer/reporter/columnist for the "Los Angeles Times" in the 1980s, the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" in the 1990s and the "Pittsburgh Tribune-Review" in the 2000s. Hundreds of his Q&amp;A interviews and libertarian op-ed columns written for the Pittsburgh Trib were nationally syndicated in the 2000s by CagleCartoons.com. His free-lance articles and commentaries have appeared in major newspapers in the USA and in magazines like Reason. 
In 2009 he retired from daily newspaper work to focus on writing books.
His "Dogging Steinbeck: Discovering America and Exposing The Truth About Travels with Charley," carefully retraced the 10,000-mile road trip around the USA that author John Steinbeck made in 1960 for his nonfiction classic "Travels with Charley." Steigerwald's research in libraries and on his own 11,276-mile road trip in 2010 proved that Steinbeck and his editors at The Viking Press had significantly fictionalized the account of his iconic journey. 
Steigerwald's 2017 history book "30 Days a Black Man" tells the forgotten story of "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" reporter Ray Sprigle's undercover mission into the Jim Crow South in 1948.
Born in 1947, Bill Steigerwald is the oldest member of the Pittsburgh multimedia family that includes his TV sports brothers John Steigerwald (formerly of KDKA-TV) and Paul Steigerwald (former radio and TV play-by-play announcer of the Pittsburgh Penguins) and Dan Steigerwald (aka, Danny Stag, lead guitarist for the hard-rock band Kingdom Come).

Troilo I de' Rossi

Troilo I de' Rossi (c. 1462 - 3 June 1521) was an Italian condottiero and the first marquess of San Secondo.
Life.
A son of Giovanni Rossi "il Diseredato" and Angela Scotti Douglas, he was born in San Secondo. He took part in Louis XII of France's conquest of the duchy of Milan in 1500, during which many lands taken from his grandfather by Ludovico il Moro and ending up in the hands of members of the Sforza family were restored to him. However, it proved impossible to restore to him all the lands his family had controlled in the time of Pier Maria II and it was possibly as compensation for this fact that Louis made him marquess of San Secondo on 15 August 1502. Louis also made him a senator of Milan in 1505 and allowed him to accept the inheritance left him by his uncle Bertrando in 1502 in return for a payment of 8000 florins and the promise never to rehabilitate his cousin Filippo Maria, Troilo's bitter rival and the designated heir of Pier Maria II.
He restored the Rocca dei Rossi at San Secondo, rebuilding its bastions and towers, which had been demolished during the war with the Sforza, and expanding the defensive perimeter. He died there in June 1521, leaving the marquisate weak - his heirs were still in their minority and so the Rossi of Corniglio tried to take advantage of the situation with a force led by Filippo Maria and Bernardo, descendants of Guido de' Rossi, the son Pier Maria II had chosen to succeed himself.
Marriage and issue.
In 1503 he married countess Bianca Riario, daughter of Girolamo Riario, lord of Imola and sister of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, pope Sixtus IV's nephew and pope Julius II's cousin. They had nine children:

Hiral Tipirneni

Hiral Vyas Tipirneni ( ; born September 28, 1967) is an Indian-American politician and physician who for 10 years worked in Phoenix, Arizona area Emergency Departments, is a cancer research advocate, serves on the Board of Directors of the Maricopa Health Foundation, and was the Democratic nominee for special election for Arizona's 8th congressional district, which was called to fill the congressional seat after former GOP Representative Trent Franks resigned following a sexual misconduct scandal.
Tipirneni won a special primary election on February 27, 2018, and was defeated by Republican nominee Debbie Lesko in the general election on April 24, 2018. However, she managed to lower the Republican margin of victory by over 16 percentage points. Tipirneni was defeated again in the regular election in November 2018 by an eleven-point margin.
Tipirneni ran again in the 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona as the Democratic nominee for Arizona's 6th congressional district, a suburban district that was more Democratic-leaning than Arizona's 8th. She lost to the incumbent David Schweikert with 47.8% of the vote. After election night, she sent out a fundraising email asking for funds to ensure her supporters' votes were counted, drawing widespread criticism that she was attempting to undermine faith in the election, and comparisons to Martha McSally and Donald Trump.
Early life and education.
Tipirneni was born in Mumbai, India, and in 1971, aged 3, with her parents, immigrated to the United States, and settled in Cleveland, Ohio.
Tipirneni earned her Doctor of Medicine degree from Northeast Ohio Medical University.
Medical career.
Following graduation from medical school, Tipirneni became chief resident in the University of Michigan Health System's Emergency Department, and later became a member of the Board of Directors of Maricopa Health Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the Maricopa Integrated Health System.
Electoral history.
2018 congressional special election.
In August 2017, Tipirneni, a Democrat, announced her candidacy for the congressional seat representing the 8th district then held by Republican Trent Franks. She later entered the race in the special election for Arizona's 8th congressional district, following Franks' resignation amidst numerous claims of sexual misbehavior with female staffers. Tipirneni defeated Brianna Westbrook in the special primary election on Tuesday, February 27, 2018.
General election.
She faced Debbie Lesko in the general election on Tuesday, April 24, 2018. Tipirneni has garnered some national support including endorsements from End Citizens United and Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman from Arizona. However, she has received little support from national Democratic campaign groups. Although a relative newcomer to politics, she has been successful in raising more campaign funds than her opponent and is also outspending Lesko in television ads. A poll published by Emerson College on April 16 had Tipirneni with "a slight lead, 46 percent to 45 percent". Another poll published by Lake Research Partners had the candidates tied at 44 to 44.
Tipirneni lost by a relatively small margin in a district that has historically leaned heavily towards her opponent's party. She earned 47.6% of the vote to Lesko's 52.4% in a district that voted for President Donald Trump by a 21% margin. Tipirneni planned to run again in the regular elections in November 2018.
2018 congressional general election.
Tipirneni won the otherwise uncontested Democratic primary. She was defeated for a second time by Debbie Lesko, getting 44.5% of the vote to Lesko's 55.5%.
2020 congressional general election.
Tipirneni won a four-way Democratic primary with 53.2% of the vote. She then lost the general election to the incumbent David Schweikert, getting 47.8% of the vote to Schweikert's 52.2%.
Political positions.
Her campaign has focused on issues related to health care, education, and retirement security, and emphasizes her "data-driven approach" to public policy. Tipirneni also advocates for "commonsense" gun control measures, comprehensive immigration reform, and a public health insurance option. Tipirneni also agrees that Americans have the Second Amendment right to purchase firearms legally in order "to protect their homes, themselves and their families, and for hunting and sport".
Personal life.
Hiral met her husband Kishore Tipirneni during the first year of medical school. They have two daughters and a son.

Heiwadai Park

 or Miyazaki Peace Park is a municipal park in Miyazaki, Miyazaki on Japan's Kyushu Island. A popular honeymoon destination for Japanese couples, the park's Peace Tower has generated controversy because of its place in Japanese history.
Park description.
Heiwadai Park is located in the Shimokitagata-cho region of Miyazaki City. It has an area of . The park houses the Miyazaki Shrine, which is devoted to Emperor Jimmu who by legend is from the Miyazaki region.
History.
The park was constructed in 1939 to commemorate the 2600th anniversary of Japan's Imperial establishment. The Hakko Ichiu tower, later renamed the Peace Tower, was built in 1940. When princess Takako Shimazu honeymooned there in 1960, the park became a favorite destination for Japanese newlyweds. Hibiya Park was designated Heiwadai's sister park in 1965, in a ceremony in which Heiwadai received doves from Hibiya.
Haniwa Garden.
The Haniwa Garden, in size, is located north of the Peace Tower. A central feature of the Haniwa Garden is more than 400 haniwa (terracotta clay figures) which are placed along paths within the garden. These are earthenware replicas of burial haniwa originally excavated at the site. These figures take the form of animals, boats, dancers, houses, and warriors.
Peace Tower.
A tower was constructed in 1940 to memorialize the installment of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu. The original name was Hakkō ichiu Tower, meaning "Eight World Regions Under One Roof," a slogan of the Imperial Japanese Army. Designed by Jitsuzo Hinago, the tower was created from stones gathered from around the then-current extent of the Japanese empire at a cost of 670,000 yen. The writing "Hakkō ichiu" was removed after the Japanese defeat at the insistence of the U.S. military. The tower was the inception point for the torch relay of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Subsequent to the Olympics, which coincided with worldwide interest in the Japanese Imperial family, the local tourism association successfully petitioned the Miyazaki Prefecture to re-install the "Hakkō ichiu" characters.
The tower has been a point of some controversy, as many Japanese citizens wonder how a structure created specifically to convey Japanese might during a period of conquest can now be a symbol for peace. Some people consider the lack of documentation regarding the militaristic genesis of the tower to subtract from the structure's re-imagined power as a symbol for peace. Other survivors of the period have stated that the tower allows the horrors of war to be passed down through generations.

HMS Shamrock (1808)

HMS "Shamrock" was a schooner built at Bermuda in 1808 of Bermuda cedar. She was built for the Royal Navy and was the name-ship of her class of 10-gun schooners. She was wrecked in 1811.
Career.
"Sahmrock" was commissioned under Lieutenant Abraham Bowen in 1808. There was a report that she had been lost on a passage from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Barbados, and some official mentions to that effect, but these are clearly in error.
In 1809 Lieutenant Wentworth Parsons Croke replaced Bowen. Between 22 December 1810 and 16 January 1811 "Shamrock" underwent repairs at Portsmouth. She then departed carrying dispatches for Lisbon.
Loss.
"Lloyd's List" initially reported on 2 April 1811 that "HM schooner Shamrock" had been lost off Cape St Mary's, and that her crew had been saved. 
Lieutenant Croke was cruising south east of Cape St Vincent when "Shamrock" pursued two merchant vessels that she did not catch. She then turned north to regain her station. At 10:30 pm on 23 February 1811 she ran aground, which came as a considerable shock as Croke had thought himself well-clear of land. It proved impossible to get her off and as waves poured over her and she filled with water he had "Shamrock"s masts cut away. They fell towards shore and the crew used them to scramble to safety. Still, two men died in the wreck. When the sun rose, Croke was able to see that "Shamrock" was about one and a half miles south of Cabo de Santa Maria. The location was approximately .
The subsequent court-martial admonished Croke to be more careful in the future. The causes of the loss were a miscalculation in navigation and strong currents that had put "Shamrock" much further north than he had realized, but Croke had failed to take necessary precautions when approaching land.

JobTeaser

JobTeaser is a French company that provides recruitment solutions to companies for the recruitment of young talent and a free career center software to higher education institutions in Europe. It was founded by Adrien Ledoux and Nicolas Lombard in 2008. Its head office is in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. As of January 2018, over 700.000 students and 500 universities used the service across Europe.
History.
Early steps.
Adrien Ledoux and Nicolas Lombard created JobTeaser in 2008, with the aim of changing access to information about companies for young talents. From the beginning, they focused on students looking for an internship and recent graduates looking for their first job. The first goal of JobTeaser was to let companies make videos about them, their employees’ daily missions and their culture to help students in their career guidance.
First fundraising and business model changes.
In 2013, JobTeaser created career centers that they implemented in French business and engineering schools. They used the institution’s branding and replaced its old career center with the JobTeaser platform. The first serviced institution was French business school ESSEC. The platform featured information about jobs and companies, as well as career advice and job and internship listings.
JobTeaser used a two-sided market approach by equipping one market for free and getting revenue streams from another market.
JobTeaser also launched a yearly “Employment Barometer”. In this report, they compared the jobs and industries that recruit the most and those that appeal to students and young graduates the most.
At the beginning of 2015, JobTeaser received 3 million euros in funding from Seventure Partners, with the aim of becoming a European leader for recruiting young talents. Later in the year, the company signed their first university intranet with the Université de Nantes.
Second fundraising and European expansion.
As part of their European expansion, JobTeaser opened an office in Munich, Germany. As of May 2017, they were active in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. They serviced 90% of the CAC 40 companies.
In May 2017, JobTeaser raised 15 million euros to speed up their international expansion. Their investors are Alven Capital, Idinvest Partners, Seventure Partners and Korelya Capital. Adrien Ledoux said that the funds would mostly be used for recruiting international business developers and expand beyond their active countries.
Features.
JobTeaser has a public website, as well as career center platforms for each of their institutional partners. These partners can share private information with their students, such as extra job offers or on-campus events.
On all platforms, JobTeaser offers video content about companies and jobs at these companies. The company’s revenue is based on paid deals with companies. Their main activity is multi-posting: a company can pay to target several Universities using the Career Center and post only once on the whole system, therefore saving time.
Corporate affairs.
Human resources.
In 2015, the company had 20 employees. At the end of 2016, the company had 70 employees. As of January 2019, the company has 200 employees.
The company won the Great Place to Work award in November 2016.

Adhunik Geet

Adhunik Geet or Adhuneek Geet (Nepali: आधुनिक गीत), meaning "modern song", is a genre of Nepali music, which emerged in the 1950s and derives its influence from folk, classical, western music and Ghazals. Musicians such as Master Ratna Das Prakash, Amber Gurung, Nati Kaji drew together the core elements of this often sentimental genre.
After the Rana regime was overpowered and restored to King Tribhuban in 1951, the banning of mass media by the Ranas was reversed. With this came the influence of other musical genres and film songs from India (Bollywood) to Nepal. The state sponsored Radio Nepal was founded in April 1951 and radio became the prime vehicle for promotion of music. The Government actively promoted Nepali as the national language and in 1961 Ratna Recording Trust began to produce phonographic records of Nepali Adhunik Geet. Radio Nepal and Ratna Recording trust circulated Nepali popular music to advance the sense of Nepali nationalism. Adhunik Geet became Nepal's popular music and remains to do so today. Although it is listened by all, the primary audience is the older, educated, urban dweller.

Muineal

Muineal () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Muineal is bounded on the north by Derryconnessy and Tonlegee townlands, on the south by Teeboy townland, on the west by Corratillan and Knockmore, County Cavan townlands and on the east by Arderry townland. Its chief geographical features are the River Blackwater, County Cavan,a small stream, forestry plantations, spring wells and dug wells. Muineal is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The crossroads is known as "Devine’s Cross". The townland covers 104 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Muineal was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Muninial otherwise Munial".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list thirteen tithepayers in the townland.
The Muineal Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 58, being 30 males and 28 females. There were eight houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 38, being 23 males and 15 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were five houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 31, being 19 males and 12 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 21, being 10 males and 11 females. There were four houses in the townland and all were inhabited. (page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 29, being 15 males and 14 females. There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 33, being 14 males and 19 females. There were five houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland.

Vernacular painting in China

A vernacular painting in China is a realistic, folk depiction of scenes from everyday domestic life.
The term is often applied to paintings that were frequently displayed in High Qing China during the New Year and birthdays. In his 2010 book "Pictures for Use and Pleasure", art historian James Cahill defines the term as "a great body of painting, created over the centuries by studio artists working in the cities, artists who produced pictures as required for diverse everyday domestic and other uses." These paintings were often created on silk, and pieces created for women were known for depicting "a range of topics not dealt with in literati painting."
The paintings revealed Chinese life and the workings of Chinese society, Vernacular paintings were frequently created by master artists with only small prestige in city studios. They also differed from other paintings made during the era in that they were seen as functional and frequently lacked inscriptions, whereas the culture of the time "professed to despise functionalism." 
As Chinese connoisseurs preferred paintings where the artist's brushwork skill, as well as their feelings and temperament, showed in the art, these paintings were seen as lesser in value and considered to be irrelevant. Some of the elements in Vernacular Paintings, such as the use of paintings for celebrations and life events such as weddings and birthdays, would later be co-opted by some of the more elite art styles such as Shanghai painting.

This List of Medal of Honor recipients from the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment is sortable by recipient, rank, company, place, date, and reason for the award. The 1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Background.
The First Virginia Cavalry, later to be renamed the 1st West Virginia Cavalry Regiment, was formed during the summer and fall of 1861 to fight for the Union in the American Civil War. (Do not confuse this regiment with the Confederate 1st Virginia Cavalry.) Although it started slowly, it became one of the most effective of all West Virginia regiments. The regiment had more Medal of Honor recipients than any other West Virginia regiment. The majority of its fighting took place in Virginia and what is now West Virginia, although the regiment also fought in Maryland and Pennsylvania (including the Battle of Gettysburg). The regiment participated in most of Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, and was present at Robert E. Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox. The regiment mustered out July 8, 1865. It lost 10 officers and 71 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, and 126 enlisted men died from disease.

Fives-Lille

Fives-Lille was a French engineering company located at Fives, a suburb of Lille. It is now part of the Fives Group.
History.
The company began as in 1861 and made a joint venture with the Société J. F. Cail &amp; Cie.. and Pierre Schaken[] were of Belgian origin. This co-operation led to expansion and the creation of several factories. One plant, located in the district of Fives, near Lille, specialized in the construction of rails and steam locomotives. Another plant in Givors on the Rhône specialized in wheelsets for railway rolling stock.
The business developed and became, in 1865, the "Compagnie de Fives - Lille", then in 1868, the limited company "Compagnie de Fives-Lille pour constructions mécaniques et entreprises". It appears that the Cail company kept its separate identity and did not merge with Fives-Lille until 1958. Later, it changed its name to "Fives-Lille-Cail" and then to "Fives-Cail-Babcock" and finally to "Fives", in 2007.

Yunnan under Ming rule

Yunnan under Ming rule saw the continuation of the "tusi" system instituted during the Yuan dynasty, increasing centralization, and Han migration into Yunnan.
Conquest of Yunnan.
The Ming dynasty conquered Mongol held Yunnan in April 1382. 
The ruling Duan family was removed from power. Duan Ming and his two sons were taken to Nanjing, where they were assigned honorary posts without any power.
Mu Ying, one of the generals who participated in the conquest, was stationed in Yunnan, and his family remained in power until the end of the Ming dynasty.
Administrative history.
Zongbing.
In 1384, the Hongwu Emperor decided to station Mu Ying in Yunnan permanently. The Mu clan held the hereditary military position of "zongbing", or commander-in-chief, the highest military position in Yunnan. As a result, the Mu family became incredibly affluent and wealthy, holding sway over the economy and politics of Yunnan into the 1600s. It was not until 1610 that an inspection of the Mu estates was launched, however no further action was ever taken.
Military immigration.
After the conquest of Yunnan, 90,000 soldiers were stationed there. These hereditary military soldiers were encouraged to marry before relocating and were provided with civilian transportation aids by the government. Some were even discharged from the military for being bachelors. Under the "weisuo" guard battalion system, 30 percent of the military apparatus in Yunnan undertook drilling practice while the rest participated in agricultural production. Military households were followed by land hungry farmers, exiled officials, and profit driven merchants.
The total population of Han settlers in Yunnan in the early 16th century has been estimated to be anywhere between one and three million, about a third of the province's total population. By the end of the Ming dynasty the Han had become the dominant majority in Yunnan. This combination of Han and native cultures paved the way for a province wide Yunnanese identity where there had been none before.
In 1413 a portion of Yunnan was separated and turned into Guizhou province.
Native chieftains.
Yunnan was separated into three broad administrative areas: the inner land north of the Baoshan-Yuanjiang line, the "barbarian" area south of the line, and the furthest south known as "yuyi", "containing barbarians".
The inner land included Chuxiong, Yaoan, Heqing, Xundian, Wuding, Lijiang, Luoxiong, Zhaozhou, Lu'nan, Jianchuan, Mile, Shizong, Anning, Ami, Luliang, Zhanyi, Luoci, and Yuanmou.
The barbarian area included Cheli (Chiang Hung), Babai (Lanna), Luchuan (abolished in Luchuan-Pingmian Campaigns, year 1444), Nandian (Lianghe), Ganya (Yingjiang), Longchuan (Longchuan), Mengmao (Ruili), Lujiang, Gengma, Chashan, Menglian.
The furthest south known as "yuyi" had a few commanders stationed there but was only nominally under Ming control.
In total, there were 179 military native chieftains ("tusi") and 255 civilian native chieftains ("tuguan") in Yunnan during the Ming period. They were given artifacts of authority such as imperial certificates, seals, hats, and belts. The Ming controlled the native succession process and created detailed laws and codes to follow. In 1436 native chieftains were ordered to provide genealogical charts with names of sons and nephews. In 1441 they were ordered to provide four copies of the charts and update it every three years. In 1489 the Ming proclaimed that regency would be held by the state if the successor was younger than 15. In 1555 native chieftains were forbidden from cross-border marriages and from communication with "outer barbarians".
The Ming also began removing native chieftainships where possible. In 1443 the Heqing tusi was removed, in 1478 Xundian, in 1481 Guangxi, in 1522 Ningzhou, in 1585 Luoxiong, in 1607 Wuding, and in 1621 Yunlong.
In 1395 the state began constructing schools in Yunnan.
In 1481 it became regulation for native boys to be selected for education at the Guozijian.

Tweedy John Todd

Tweedy John Todd (1789–1840) (also known as Tweedie John Todd, or John Tweedy Todd) was an English doctor, Royal Navy surgeon and naturalist who conducted early experimental work on healing and regeneration in animals.
Biography.
Early life.
Tweedy John Todd was born in 1789 in Berwick-Upon-Tweed where his father was a borough treasurer. Todd studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but did not complete his degree, joining the Royal Navy instead in 1809.
Navy career.
Todd began his career as a Royal Navy surgeon working in the Royal Naval Hospital at Plymouth. He later sailed to the East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope and was appointed surgeon on the flagship of Sir Robert Stopford aged only 23. While at the Cape of Good Hope aboard , he performed experiments on the electric ray ("Torpedo sp"), which were published in the "Philosophical Transactions" "of the Royal Society."
Todd retired from the navy in 1816, and lived in Italy for 6 or 7 years. Following this he returned to his studies and completed two medical degrees, first at the University of Montpellier, then at the University of Aberdeen before ultimately settling in Brighton in 1829, where he developed a medical practice.
Scientific Work.
While studying and then working as a physician in Brighton, Todd continued to publish papers on natural history, including work on fireflies in "The Luminous Power of Some of the Lampyrides" in 1827. In 1831 wrote "The Book of Analysis. A New Method of Experience", in order to encourage physicians and scientists to apply the Baconian method of inductive reasoning to medicine and the other natural sciences.
Todd began experiments on healing using newts at the British Naval base in Naples, and continued when he moved to Brighton. He conducted a series of experiments on the newts and other animals such as worms to study the processes of healing and regeneration of wounds and amputated body parts. These were the first experiments that proved that nerves have a role in healing, and that amphibian limbs cannot regenerate if the nerves are cut. He observed the healing process microscopically and collaborated with histologist Charles Ager to produce over 3,000 microscope slides to illustrate his findings. These slides are amongst the earliest surviving examples of the use of Canada balsam as a mountant.
Todd's research was not well known in the second half of the 19th century, but was the basis of many studies in the early 20th century, and more recently the importance of Todd's work has been acknowledged by medical historians.
Todd died from Tuberculosis on 4 August 1840, in Hurst, Sussex. He was aged 50 or 51. After his death his large collection of microscope slides came to the attention of Richard Owen, who was then the conservator of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, but would later become the first director of the Natural History Museum. Owen was impressed by the quality of the slides and in 1841 he purchased 1,500 of them for £150 to use in the teaching of surgeons. The slides are considered to be important in the history of medicine, histology and microscopy and they remain in the College's collection today.

Canaan Union Academy was a whites-only school established in 1839 in Canaan, New Hampshire, after a mob of segregationists and anti-abolitionists destroyed the integrated Noyes Academy in 1835. After about twenty years as a school, the building was abandoned until at least 1886, falling into disrepair. Canaan Union Academy was eventually reestablished, and continued in operation until 1892.
In 1903, the residents of the Town of Canaan voted to spend $100 () to convert the Academy building into a library. The building was the location for the Canaan Town Library from 1904 until 1978. The Canaan Historical Museum began sharing the building with the library in 1961. When the library moved to the larger Canaan Community Building in 1978, the Canaan Historical Society and Museum took sole responsibility for the Academy building.
The building features a two-story porch and open belfry topped by a low pyramidal roof. It is part of the Canaan Street Historic District.

Krishna of Devagiri

Krishna (IAST: Kṛṣṇa, r. c. 1246-1261 CE), also known as Kannara, was a ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of Deccan region in India. He successfully invaded the Paramara kingdom of Malwa, and fought inconclusive wars against the Vaghelas and the Hoysalas. The Yadava inscriptions also credit him or his generals with several other victories.
Early life.
Krishna was a son of the Yadava king Simhana, and succeeded Simhana presumably because his father Jaitugi II died before Simhana. An inscription dated 2 November 1248 was issued during the second year of Simhana's reign, and an inscription dated 25 December 1248 was issued during the third year of his reign. This suggests that Simhana ascended the throne in November or December 1246.
In various Kannada inscriptions, Krishna's name appears as Kanha, Kanhara or Kandhara.
Wars.
Krishna maintained the territory that he had inherited from his father. The Yadava inscriptions credit him with several conquests. For example, the Munoli inscription describes him as:
Paramaras.
The Paramara dynasty ruled the Malwa kingdom located to the north of the Yadava kingdom. By the time of Krishna's ascension, the Paramara power and prestige had declined because of invasions from the Iltutmish-led Delhi Sultanate. Krishna took advantage of this situation, and invaded Malwa sometime during the reign of the Paramara king Jaitugideva. The invasion must have happened in or before 1250, when the Yadava records first mention it.
The Munoli inscription compares Krishna to Shiva ("trinetra") and the Paramara king to the Madana (in Hindu mythology, Shiva incinerates Madana). The Mamadapur inscription also alludes to Krishna's victory over the Paramara king. The invasion does not seem to have resulted in any territorial annexation.
Vaghelas.
Krishna also attempted an invasion of the Vaghela-ruled Gujarat (Gurjara) region. The Vaghela king Visala-deva had married a Hoysala princess: both these kingdoms were traditional rivals of the Yadavas, and the marriage may have provided additional provocation for Krishna's invasion.
The conflict was probably limited to a few frontier skirmishes, which variously resulted in advantage for the Yadavas and the Vagehlas, and did not result in any significant territorial changes. Both Yadava and Vaghela records claim victory in this inconclusive conflict. The Yadavas' Paithan inscription and a eulogy by their court-poet Hemadri claim that Krishna destroyed the forces of Visala-deva. On the other hand, the Vaghelas' Dabhoi inscription claims that Visala-deva defeated Krishna.
Hoysalas.
Krishna's general Chamunda claims to have "humbled the pride" of the Hoysala king Someshvara sometime before 1250. According to historian A. S. Altekar, this may be a reference to the Yadava success in a frontier skirmish. Historian T. V. Mahalingam theorizes that the Yadava forces were able to capture a part of the Hoysala territory, as attested by the discovery of Krishna's inscriptions in the present-day Chitradurga district. The Hoysala records claim victory for Someshvara.
Pandyans.
Krishna's general Bichana, who was the viceroy of the southern part of Yadava kingdom, claims to have defeated the Pandyans sometime before 1253. Historian T. V. Mahalingam believes this to be conventional claim without any historical basis. According to historian A. S. Altekar, there may be some truth to this claim: the Pandyan king Jatavarman Sundara had invaded the Kakatiya kingdom, advancing as far as Nellore. It is possible that the Kakatiya king Ganapati, who ruled as a Yadava feudatory for several years, requested Krishna's help against the Pandya invasion, and Krishna dispatched Bichana to help him.
Cholas.
The Munoli inscription of Krishna's general Chamunda states that Krishna defeated the Cholas, but this appears to be an exaggeration.
Kalachuris.
The Munoli inscription states that Krishna captured the Kalachuri capital Tripuri. The Kalachuri kingdom had ceased to exist by the mid-13th century, and their former territory had practically turned into a no-man's land. it is possible that Krishna or one of his generals occupied Tripuri for a while.
Last days.
Krishna's last inscription is dated May 1261. His son Ramachandra was probably not born or was not old enough to hold the title of "yuvaraja" (heir apparent) at the time of his ascension, or to ascend the throne at the time of his death. Krishna's brother Mahadeva, who was designated the heir apparent since at least 1250 and assisted the king in the administration, succeeded him in 1261. Mahadeva was succeeded by his son Ammana, but Ramachandra forcefully dethroned him and became the new king in 1271.
Administration.
Simhana's generals and officers, such as Bichana and his elder brother Mallisetti, continued to serve Krishna. Mallisetti, who was a district officer under Simhana, rose to the rank of "sarva-deshadhikari" (viceroy) early in Krishna's reign. His son Chamunda-raya held the titles "maha-pradhana" and "maha-matya" since around 1250.
Lakshmideva, a Gujarati Brahmin, was another important minister of Krishna, and claims to have helped consolidate the king's rule. His son Jalhana was a counsellor as well as a leader of the elephant force, and claims to have won several battles for Krishna. Jalhana also compiled or commissioned the compilation of the Sanskrit anthology "Sukti-muktavali". His sons Ramachandra and Keshava held fiefs in present-day Satara district, and continued to serve the Yadavas after their father's death.
Religion.
Krishna followed Vedic Hinduism, and one of his inscriptions describes him as "Vedoddhara" ("upholder of the Vedas"). 13th century Yadava court scholar Hemadri credits him with performing several ritual sacrifices and rejuvenating the weakened "dharma". The Mahanubhava text "Lila-charita" states that Krishna had high regard for the Mahanubhava saints, he visited the sect's founder Chakradhara at Lonar.
Cultural activities.
The literary works composed during Krishna's reign include:

Olive Chadeayne

Olive Kingsley Chadeayne (February 9, 1904 - February 23, 2001) was an American architect who worked primarily in California from 1927 to 1970.
Early life and education.
Though born in New York, at the age of eleven Chadeayne moved with her family to Van Nuys in southern California. She began studying architecture in 1922 at UCLA, but transferred to the University of California, Berkeley in 1923 after the program at UCLA was discontinued. She graduated in 1926 with her B.A., after which she continued with post-graduate studies for one year, receiving her master's in 1927.
Career.
Following her graduation, Chadeayne sought work at a number of Los Angeles-based firms, but found that few would consider hiring a woman. Eventually she was able to find work as a draftsperson at the firm of Pierpoint and Walter S. Davis. After their office closed during the Depression, she was able to find work in the mid-1930s with the architect and fellow UC Berkeley alumna Lilian Jeannette Rice. Based in the Rancho Santa Fe area, she specialized in residences and civic buildings in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. Following Rice's death from ovarian cancer in late 1938, Chadeayne completed several of her unfinished projects and closed the firm's office soon thereafter. She began to teach a House Planning course at Cornell University as part of the Home Economics curriculum, but returned to Burbank, California in 1942, where she worked as a production illustrator for the Lockheed Corporation for the rest of World War II.
Chadeayne resumed her own practice following the war, while contracting with other firms. In 1951, she took a job with the large firm David, Mann, Johnson, and Mendenhall where she became experienced in writing specifications, which developed into her specialty for the remainder of her career. She retired in 1970, but continued to work on a part-time basis and shared her expertise through organizations like the Association for Women Architects and the American Institute of Architects.

Inclusion rider

An inclusion rider or equity rider is a provision in an actor's or filmmaker's contract that provides for a certain level of diversity in casting and production staff. For example, the rider might require a certain proportion of actors or staff to be women, people of color, LGBT people or people with disabilities. Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions. The term is derived from the "rider", a provision in the contract of performing actors to ensure certain aspects of a performance such as personal amenities or technical infrastructure.
History.
The idea was developed by Stacy L. Smith, professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, in a 2014 op-ed for "The Hollywood Reporter" and in her 2016 TED talk. Together with the film executive Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni and the employment attorney Kalpana Kotagal Smith created a template for an inclusion rider.
Inclusion riders became more widely known at the 2018 Academy Awards, when actress Frances McDormand said at the end of her Best Actress acceptance speech, "I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider!" McDormand had learned about inclusion riders only the week before the awards ceremony.
Still, in June 2019, the "New York Times" reported that inclusion riders remained rarely used, even though studios pursued other diversity policies. In March 2018, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings declined to adopt an inclusion rider for Netflix productions.

Alice Eliza Loane writing as M. Loane (23 October 1863 – 18 January 1922) was a British author. She is known for being a party to a deception where the joint works of her and her sister were published as the sole work of her sister Martha Loane. In 1910 they fell out and Alice created the only book in her name.
Life.
Loane was born in Southsea in 1863. Her elder sister Martha became a nurse and by 1897 the first article was appearing in the Nursing Notes. Over the next 14 years, more articles appeared in "Nursing Notes" and then she moved on to the "Evening News" and "The Spectator". Using their joint expertise she wrote nursing textbooks including "The District Nurse as Health Missioner". Alice's most valued works work social commentaries which described the poverty at that time. The first of these "The Queen's Poor" was published in 1905.
They were close until 1910 when her sister Martha's conversion to Catholicism caused a break. When Alice died in 1922 it was found that she had written a will to leave her estate to her sister but the will was not signed. Because of the lack of signature her will was not cleared until four years after her sisters death.
Loane died in Clifton in 1922.
Works.
These were all published under M.Loane or a similar name but these were attributed to Alice with input from her sister long after they had both died.

The British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation (Salvage) Ltd., commonly referred to as BISCO, was an organisation created during World War II to recycle scrap steel.
BISCO's duties included making the arrangements for the scrapping of surplus Royal Navy ships. The Admiralty would notify BISCO that a ship was available for scrapping; BISCO would then allocate it to a suitable yard for breaking up. The yards were paid their dismantling costs plus an amount per ton of steel recovered. This continued until 1962, after which yards were free to make their own contracts directly.

In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Moneynure was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the name as "Munenoore". 
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 24 February 1614, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, "one pole of Monenoure to Phelim McHugh O'Reyly, Bryan McHugh O'Reyly and Cahir McHugh O'Reyly, the sons of Hugh Reyly, late of Ballaghaneo, County Cavan." Ballaghaneo is now the townland of Ballaghanea in Lurgan Parish, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Ramor, so the O'Reillys were removed a long way from their home by the Plantation. Hugh Reyly was the great-grandnephew of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eoghan na Fésóige mac Seoain, who ruled from 1418–1449. The O’Reilly lands in Moneynure were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as "Captain Payne" and the tenant as "Daniell McConell".
A lease dated 31 January 1718 from Morley Saunders to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Moninure".
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Moneynure", as does a further deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Monerure".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Moneymore" and the proprietor as "John Ennery".
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Moneynure otherwise Monanure".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list seven tithepayers in the townland. 
The Moneynure Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 33, being 17 males and 16 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 20, being 9 males and 11 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were four houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists eight landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 20, being 8 males and 12 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 20, being 13 males and 7 females. There were four houses in the townland and all were inhabited. (page 296 of census)

Christian Boros

Christian Boros (born 1964) is a German advertising agency founder and art collector, who owns an art gallery in a former bunker in Berlin.
Early life.
Christian Boros was born in Zabrze, Poland in 1964. His family moved from Poland to Cologne, West Germany, in order to escape communism. Boros earned a degree in communication design from the University of Wuppertal, Germany. He wrote his thesis on the aesthetic of the evil characters in James Bond.
Career.
Boros founded an eponymous advertising agency in Wuppertal. Boros has appeared in the "ARTnews" list of the top 200 collectors since 2006.
In 2003, Boros and his wife purchased a former Second World War bomb shelter, the Reichsbahnbunker in Mitte, Berlin. The bunker was converted by Casper Mueller Kneer, who are responsible for White Cube in London. In 2008, Boros opened his gallery in the bunker. The gallery space of was designed by Realarchitektur, including the rooftop residential penthouse, and contained pieces that Boros had been collecting for over 30 years. The collection includes numerous works by Danh Vo, Elizabeth Peyton, Wolfgang Tillmans, Ai Weiwei, Thomas Ruff, Klara Lidén, Anselm Reyle, Tobias Rehberger and Olafur Eliasson. Entrance to the gallery is by guided tour only.
Boros' bunker was built in 1943 by the architect Karl Bonatz on the orders of Adolf Hitler. After the Second World War, the bunker was used as a fruit warehouse, before later becoming a fetish nightclub, with a reputation for being the "most hardcore club in the world," featuring techno music and frequent sadomasochism (S&amp;M) nights, or "raves and sex parties" according to ARTnews.
Boros bought a building which was home to a children dancing school for twenty years. After the purchase, there was a controversy about doubling of the rental fee in 2009 and alleged speculation. As a result, the dancing school had to leave the building in 2019.
Personal life.
Boros is married to Karen Lohmann, and they live in Berlin, in a 550 sq metre (5920 sq feet) penthouse flat above their gallery.

Flamingo (horse)

Flamingo (1925 – 7 November 1947) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In 1927 he was one of the best two-year-old colts in England when he won three of his five races including the National Breeders' Produce Stakes. In the following year he won the 2000 Guineas and the Great Yorkshire Stakes as well as finishing second in the Epsom Derby and fourth in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Flamingo was a small but "beautifully made" bay horse bred in England by Sir John Robinson. As a yearling he was offered for sale and was bought for 1800 guineas by Jack Jarvis on behalf of Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford. The colt was take into training by Jarvis at his Park Lodge stable at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Flamingo was sired by Flamboyant, a top-class stayer who won the Doncaster Cup in 1921 and the Goodwood Cup in 1922. Flamingo's dam Lady Peregrine has a half-sister to Omar Khayyam and became a very influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Aloma's Ruler, Septimus and Cirrus des Aigles.
Racing career.
1927: two-year-old season.
In the spring of 1927 Flamingo won the appropriately named Spring Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. He finished fourth behind Sunny Trace in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and then took the Fulbourne Stakes at Newmarket in early July, winning "cleverly" by a neck. Later in July, at Sandown Park he was ridden by Charlie Elliott (jockey) the National Breeders' Produce Stakes which was then the most valuable two-year-old race in England. Starting at odds of 7/1 in a 21-runner field he won from Jack Mytton and Maret Girl with the favoured Pharamond unplaced. He finished second on his other start that year.
Flamingo ended the season with earnings of £7328, making him the most financially successful juvenile in England, and was regarded with Fairway as one of the two leading contenders for the following year's Epsom Derby. He was described as a "dour fighter", but lacking in scope and room for improvement. In the Free Handicap, an assessment of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain he was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, making him the fourth-best horse of his generation behind Fairway, The Hermit II and Buland.
1928: three-year-old season.
During the winter of 1927/8 Jack Jarvis was reported to be "intensely pleased" with the colt's progress. Flamingo began his second season by taking the Column Produce Stakes at Newmarket in April winning by a neck from Sans Changer, to whom he was conceding fifteen pounds in weight. On 2 May, Flamingo, ridden by Elliott, started at odds of 5/1 for the 120th running over the Rowley Mile. Despite sweating up before the start, he was always traveling well and won by a head from Royal Minstrel with O'Curry a length and a half away in third. After the race Elliott said, "I had the race won just when I wanted... when I shook him up he answered with the gameness I expected."
In the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles on 6 June Flamingo was strongly fancied although Fairway started favourite. In the immediate build-up to the race the colt had been afforded police protection to prevent his being targeted by "dopers and other evilly-disposed individuals". Flamingo broke well and disputed the lead with Sunny Trace with the pair going "hell for leather" and setting an extremely strong pace before the latter gave way, allowing Flamingo open up a clear advantage in the straight. He looked exhausted however in the last quarter mile and was overtaken by the 33/1 outsider Felstead who won by one and a half lengths. Later that month the colt was beaten when sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse. According to press reports he started favourite but became agitated and upset owing to his unfamiliarity with the French starting procedures and finished unplaced behind Cri de Guerre.
Flamingo returned to the track in late August and won the Great Yorkshire Stakes over fourteen furlongs at York Racecourse carrying a weight of 135 pounds. On 10 September Flamingo contested the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Racing on unusually firm ground he came home fourth of the thirteen runners behind Fairway, Palais Royal and Cyclonic.
1929: four-year-old season.
Flamingo remained in training as a four-year-old in 1929 with the Ascot Gold Cup as his objective but did not stand up to training and was retired from racing at the end of the year.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Flamingo an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
After his retirement from racing Flamingo became a breeding stallion in England. The best of his offspring included Flyon (Ascot Gold Cup) and Flamenco (St James's Palace Stakes), Bao Dai (Prix du Petit Couvert, Prix La Haye Jousselin). Flamingo died on 7 November 1947.

Slayer Farewell Tour

The Final World Tour (also referred to as The Farewell Tour) was the final concert tour by American thrash metal band Slayer, which began on May 10, 2018, and ended on November 30, 2019. The tour, consisting of 147 shows worldwide, served as a conclusion of the band's three-and-a-half-decade-long career.
Background.
The tour was announced on January 22, 2018 through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning Slayer's entire career. Although the members of the band have never explained the decision to retire from touring, fans believe one of the reasons behind this was at the expense of vocalist/bassist Tom Araya's desire of no longer wanting to tour and spend more time with his family. The first leg of the North American tour was announced the day after, which took place in May and June 2018 and included support from Lamb of God, Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament. The second leg of the North American tour was announced on March 5, 2018; this leg took place in July and August, and featured four out of five bands from the first leg (Slayer, Lamb of God, Anthrax and Testament) and Napalm Death as the replacement for Behemoth.
On February 20, 2018, Slayer announced the first European date of the farewell tour; it was announced that they would headline the Secret Solstice Festival in Reykjavík, Iceland in June. A European leg of the farewell tour took place in November and December 2018, with support provided by Lamb of God, Anthrax and Obituary. Guitarist Gary Holt had to miss the last four dates of this tour so that he could take care of his father who was nearing the end of his life; he was filled in by former Machine Head and Vio-lence guitarist Phil Demmel.
On June 24, 2018, Slayer was announced as one of the first five bands (alongside Manowar, Carcass, Mass Hysteria and Dropkick Murphys) confirmed to play the 2019 edition of Hellfest. This was the band's first show announced for 2019, and was said to be their last show in France. Slayer also played a one-off show in Mexico at ForceFest in October 2018.
Slayer continued touring into 2019; in addition to international festival appearances, they performed in areas that the tour had not yet visited, including South America, Australia and Japan; Anthrax was the supporting act on most of the dates. Slayer toured North America in May 2019, with Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and Cannibal Corpse as the opening acts. The final North American leg of the tour took place in November 2019, and included support by Primus, Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals.
The band's final appearance in Chile on October 6, 2019 at the Santiago Gets Louder festival marked the first time two of the "" (Slayer and Anthrax) had shared the stage with one of the members of the "Big Teutonic Four" of thrash, Kreator. Megadeth – who had not shared the stage with Slayer and Anthrax since the series of "Big Four" shows in 2010-2011 – was initially scheduled to perform at the festival, but cancelled due to Dave Mustaine's illness and was replaced by Kreator.
On how long the farewell tour would last, Exodus vocalist and Holt's bandmate Steve "Zetro" Souza indicated that it would "take a year and a half or two years to do the one final thing, but I believe it's finished. Everybody knows what I know; just because I'm on the outside, I have no insight on that." Kristen Mulderig, who works with Rick Sales Entertainment Group, said that there would still be Slayer-related activities after the tour's conclusion. Despite being referred to as a farewell tour, the band's manager, Rick Sales, said that the tour was not a foreshadowing of their split, but an end of touring. Former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo did not attend the band's final show.
After finishing the set from their final show at The Forum on November 30, 2019, the band and crew members hugged each other and took group photos, followed by Tom Araya bidding farewell to the fans. Guitarist Gary Holt expressed his gratitude towards the band members and then thanked the fans for making him feel welcomed since joining in 2011.

American rapper Eminem has released 54 singles as a lead artist and nine promotional singles. He has also featured in 22 singles as a guest artist, while entering the charts with more than 90 additional songs.
Eminem's debut single, "Just Don't Give a Fuck", was released in 1998 and was included in "Slim Shady EP", as well as in his second studio album, "The Slim Shady LP", which featured a re-worked version of the song. Eminem's first song to enter the "Billboard" Hot 100 was "My Name Is", which was released in 1999 and became the most successful single from "The Slim Shady LP". It and "Guilty Conscience" both reached the top 5 in the UK.
The lead single from Eminem's third studio album, "The Marshall Mathers LP", was the song "The Real Slim Shady", which became his first entry in the top ten of the "Billboard" Hot 100. The third single from the album, "Stan", featured vocals from British singer Dido, sampled from her song "Thank You". "Stan" was the album's most successful single outside of the States, while it failed to reach the top 50 in Eminem's home country.
In 2002, Eminem released the singles "Without Me" and "Cleanin' Out My Closet" from his album "The Eminem Show", as well as the single "Lose Yourself" from the "8 Mile" soundtrack, which became his first number one song on the Hot 100 and remained on the top for 12 weeks. The song also reached the top of various national charts worldwide.
In 2009, the song "Crack a Bottle", a collaboration with label-mates Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, became Eminem's second number one on the Hot 100 and broke the record for opening week download sales in the US, with 418,000 copies sold in the first week.
"Recovery"s singles "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie" featuring Rihanna, both released in 2010, became Eminem's third and fourth number one songs on the Hot 100; the latter also reached the top of various national charts worldwide. In June 2014, his song "Not Afraid" was diamond certified by the RIAA, thus making Eminem the first artist with two digital diamond awards by RIAA.
In August 2013, Eminem released the single "Berzerk" which debuted number 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and preceded his eighth studio album "The Marshall Mathers LP 2". The album spawned the singles "Survival", which was showcased during the "" reveal trailer, "Rap God", and "The Monster" featuring Rihanna. "The Monster" became Eminem's fifth No. 1 single on the Hot 100, tying him with rappers Ludacris and P. Diddy for rappers with the most No. 1 singles in the US. In May 2014, Eminem was announced as the most-streamed artist of all time on Spotify.
From 2017 to 2020, Eminem released various hit singles, including "River" featuring Ed Sheeran, "Lucky You" featuring Joyner Lucas, "Killshot", and "Godzilla" featuring Juice Wrld. The latter two debuted at number 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.

Beautiful World (Paul Carrack album)

Beautiful World is the sixth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was originally released in 1997 on the Ark 21 label.
Album co-producer Gary Wallis was the drummer for Mike + The Mechanics at the time the album was issued, though he was at that juncture a session player and not an official member of the Mechanics. Wallis would join the revived version of Mike + The Mechanics as an official member in 2011, long after Carrack had left that group.
The album was a minor chart entry on the UK album charts, reaching #88. The album's associated single, "The Way I'm Feeling Tonight", peaked at #84 UK.
Reception.
AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: ""Beautiful World" is a thoroughly enjoyable collection of polished, mature pop-soul that is another fine addition to Paul Carrack's catalog."

<doc id="56757932" url="?curid=56757932" title="Parliamentary Oversight Panel (Germany)">
Parliamentary Oversight Panel (Germany)

The Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr) is a committee of the German Bundestag for the control of the intelligence agencies of Germany. It monitors the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) (German: "Bundesnachrichtendienst"), the Military Counter-Intelligence Service (MAD) (German: "Militärischer Abschirmdienst"), and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) (German: "Bundesverfassungsschutz"). Under the Control Body Act (German: "Kontrollgremiumgesetz" – PKGrG), the Federal Government is obliged to inform the PKGr comprehensively about the general activities of the federal intelligence services and about events of particular importance.
Tasks and Duties.
At the beginning of each legislative period, the German Bundestag elects the members of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel from among its members (Section 2 (1) PKGrG). It determines the number of members, the composition, and the working methods of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel (Section 2 (2) PKGrG). The Parliamentary Oversight Panel meets at least once every quarter. It elects a chairperson and their deputy. It adopts its own rules of procedure (Section 3 (1) PKGrG). Each member may request that the Parliamentary Oversight Panel be convened and informed (Section 3 (2) PKGrG).
To the extent that the right of control of the PKGr extends, it may demand that the Federal Government and the intelligence agencies hand over files or other documents in official custody, if necessary also in the original, and transmit data stored in files. It must be granted access to all offices of the federal intelligence services at any time (Section 5 (1) PKGrG). It may question members of the intelligence services, employees and members of the Federal Government and employees of other federal authorities after informing the federal government, or obtain written information from them. The persons to be heard are obliged to provide complete and truthful information (Section 5 (2) PKGrG).
Insofar as this is necessary for compelling reasons of access to intelligence or for reasons of protecting the personal rights of third parties, or if the core area of executive responsibility is affected, the Federal Government may both refuse to inform the PKGr about general activities and events of particular importance and to hand over files and transmit files, and also prohibit employees of the Federal Intelligence Services from providing information. The Federal Government must give reasons for both to the PKGr (Section 6 (2) PKGrG).
The members of the PKGr are regularly given an insight into the work of the federal intelligence services by the federal government. Since their work is naturally to remain secret, the members of the PKGr are bound to secrecy, even towards the other members of the Bundestag (Section 10 (1) PKGrG). Because the parliamentary right to ask questions also extends to the intelligence services, the federal government and the PKGr are obliged to provide information on urgent matters. According to the Federal Constitutional Court (German: "Bundesverfassungsgericht")'s ruling 2 BvE 5/06, the federal government's argument that intelligence matters are to be discussed exclusively in the PKGr and not made public is inadmissible because the parliamentary right to ask questions also extends to the federal intelligence services. Three copies of the minutes of the PKGr's meetings are produced.
Employees of the federal intelligence services are permitted to address the Parliamentary Oversight Panel directly in official matters as well as in cases of internal grievances, without following official channels. They may not be reprimanded or discriminated against in the service because of the fact of their submission. Submissions from citizens to the German Bundestag concerning conduct by the federal intelligence services that affects them may be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel (Section 8 PKGrG).
Within the scope of their departmental responsibilities, the Interior and Defense Committees also exercise a certain degree of control over the BfV and the MAD, respectively.
History.
Parliamentary Privy Council (PVMG).
The predecessor of the Parliamentary Control Board was the Parliamentary Confidence Committee (PVMG). It was installed in 1956 by then Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and met only three times between 1956 and 1960. After the last meeting in 1958, the body met on September 4, 1963, on the occasion of the July 23 conviction of BND employee and KGB spy Heinz Felfe. Reinhard Gehlen, then president of the BND, and his closest associates reported on the case, personnel, and security standards.
In mid-1976, the PVMG held its last meeting. When it was founded, the PVMG was solely responsible for controlling the BND. In 1965, its responsibility expanded to include the BfV and the MAD.
Parliamentary Control Commission (PKK).
In 1978, after a two-year hiatus, the PVMG was replaced by the Parliamentary Control Commission (PKK). Unlike the PVMG, the PKK was given a legal basis, the Law on Parliamentary Control of Federal Intelligence Activities (German: "Gesetz über die parlamentarische Kontrolle nachrichtendienstlicher Tätigkeit des Bundes").
Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr).
In 1999, the Parliamentary Control Commission was renamed the Parliamentary Oversight Panel, partly because of the abbreviation PKK, which the general public tends to associate with the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Since 2009, the PKGr has also been constitutionally enshrined in Article 45d of the Basic Law - the only article of the Basic Law with an official title. The law was also amended on July 29, 2009.
The PKGr sparked particular debate when parties deemed unreliable or extremist by other parties claimed a place on it. This was the case with the Greens in the 1980s and 1990s, with the PDS since 1990, and with the AfD in 2018.
Wolfgang Nešković, a non-party member of the PKGr since 2005 for the party Die Linke, was initially not confirmed by the Bundestag in December 2009, a hitherto unique occurrence. In a second vote on January 20, 2010, Nešković was then re-elected to the PKGr in a roll call vote with 320 votes in favor, 226 against, and 35 abstentions. After resigning from his parliamentary group, he left the PKGr in December 2012, and was succeeded by Steffen Bockhahn.
The Berlin Senior Attorney General Roman Reusch, nominated by the AfD, initially fell short of the necessary 355 votes in the first round of voting on January 18, 2018, after politicians from the other parties expressed reservations about Reusch. In the second round of voting, Reusch was finally elected to the PKGr.
In 2013, in the wake of the NSA surveillance scandal, in which revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden, among others, revealed that German intelligence services had also been involved in prohibited surveillance measures, Chancellor Angela Merkel initiated a reform of the Control Body Act, whereupon on 1. July 2014, several measures to increase oversight of the intelligence services were reported: Among other things, a Permanent Plenipotentiary (Intelligence Commissioner of the Bundestag) was established to support the PKGr. The PKGr was also given the task of overseeing the intelligence services.
Members of the PKGr.
The PKGr can include transitional members who are no longer members of the Bundestag: In order to ensure uninterrupted oversight of the federal intelligence services, the Parliamentary Oversight Panel continues to carry out its activities beyond the end of an electoral period of the German Bundestag until the subsequent German Bundestag has decided on a new composition (Section 3 (4) PKGrG). Such a situation existed, for example, on October 24, 2013, when, in connection with the 2013 surveillance and espionage affair and indications of eavesdropping by the United States of America on Chancellor Angela Merkel, the FDP members of the 17th German Bundestag who had not been reelected to the 18th German Bundestag took part in a special meeting of the Oversight Panel during the legislative term of the 18th German Bundestag.
19th Bundestag.
The Parliamentary Oversight Panel of the 19th Bundestag consists of nine members and was established on January 18, 2018. The CDU/CSU parliamentary group sends three members, the SPD parliamentary group two, and the AfD parliamentary group, the FDP parliamentary group, the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group and the Left Party parliamentary group one member each. The CDU/CSU parliamentary group holds the chair. After the resignation of Armin Schuster from the Bundestag, the CDU MP Roderich Kiesewetter was elected with a broad majority of 541 votes out of 355 votes required on November 25, 2020.
The other 8 members of the PKGr are: Konstantin von Notz (Alliance 90/The Greens) as deputy chairman, and Andrea Lindholz (CSU), Patrick Sensburg (CDU), Uli Grötsch (SPD), Thomas Hitschler (SPD), Roman Reusch (AfD), Stephan Thomae (FDP), and André Hahn (Linke).
18th Bundestag.
The nine members of the panel in the 18th legislative period of the German Bundestag were: Clemens Binninger (CDU) as chairman, André Hahn (Linke) as deputy chairman, and Manfred Grund (CDU), Stephan Mayer (CSU), Armin Schuster (CDU), Gabriele Fograscher (SPD), Uli Grötsch (SPD), Burkhard Lischka (SPD), and Hans-Christian Ströbele (Greens).
17th Bundestag.
Members of the 11-member body during the 17th legislative period of the German Bundestag were: Thomas Oppermann (SPD) as chairman, Michael Grosse-Brömer (CDU) as deputy chairman, and Clemens Binninger (CDU), Manfred Grund (CDU), Hans-Peter Uhl (CSU), Michael Hartmann (SPD), Fritz Rudolf Körper (SPD), Gisela Piltz (FDP), Hartfrid Wolff (FDP), Steffen Bockhahn (Linke), and Hans-Christian Ströbele (Greens).
16th Bundestag.
In the 16th legislative period of the German Bundestag, the committee had nine members. These were: Max Stadler (FDP) as chairman, Norbert Röttgen (CDU) as deputy chairman, and Bernd Schmidbauer (CDU), Hans-Peter Uhl (CSU), Fritz Rudolf Körper (SPD), Thomas Oppermann (SPD), Joachim Stünker (SPD), Wolfgang Nešković (Linke), and Hans-Christian Ströbele (Grüne).
Criticism.
The PKGr is sometimes described as "toothless," i.e., without any real power. In the past, for example, intelligence services could sometimes only be visited with advance notice, and members of the PKGr reported that intelligence service employees had told them the untruth on several occasions.
Although the Control Body Act does not provide for sanctions in the event of non-compliance with information obligations by the responsible intelligence service employees and preventive control of intelligence-related ones. However, restriction measures under the Article 10 Act must in principle be approved in advance by the G 10 Commission. Although the PKGr cannot itself bring unlawful actions to criminal charges or order the publication of corresponding, confidential documents, it can call on the German government to put a stop to abuses.
In addition, there are calls for the PKGr to be given the rights of a committee of inquiry in order to be able to effectively investigate breaches of the law (currently, for example, no evidence can be collected or witnesses summoned). However, the German Bundestag has the right to set up committees of inquiry to investigate possible misconduct in the area of the federal intelligence services, which can take evidence and summon witnesses (Section 44 of the Basic Law). The Bundestag has already made numerous uses of this right, such as in the Murat Kurnaz case or in the so-called Plutonium affair. The Defense Committee can declare itself a committee of inquiry to investigate events in the MAD (Section 45a (2) of the Basic Law).
Organizations such as netzpolitik.org also criticize the fact that the PKGr is almost completely deprived of data on cooperation with foreign intelligence services, for example. Furthermore, it is critically noted that the PKGr controls the intelligence services of the federal government, but not other security agencies, which also sometimes use quasi-intelligence resources, such as the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office or the German Customs Investigation Bureau. In particular, increasingly far-reaching powers, in terms of online searches and source telecommunication surveillance by law enforcement agencies, raise the question of who actually monitors these measures, especially since the technology used is presumably the same. At any rate, the responsible Interior Committee of the German Bundestag does not currently receive any such information due to the secrecy interests of the federal government.
Time and again, information from secret meetings of the PKGr is leaked to the mass media and thus reaches the public, including from the report on the BND journalist scandal. This could lead to the federal government making more frequent use of its right to refuse to provide information (Section 6 (2) PKGrG). Thus, the behavior of individual PKGr members would run counter to the control purpose of the parliamentary body. The PKGr asked the Bundestag President Norbert Lammert in the so-called journalist scandal at the time, to initiate legal action, because of the suspected violation of official secrets (§ 353b StGB) by the illegal disclosure of information.

On 17 May 1953, in an air battle north of Pyongyang, Yao Xian's squadron shot down four American F-86 Sabre fighters, while losing two MiG-15s. During the war he was credited with shooting down one American F-86 jet and damaging two others, and awarded the First-Grade Merit.
After the Korean War, Yao was successively promoted to regiment commander, division commander, and deputy corps commander. In 1978, he was appointed deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region Air Force. He was transferred to the Beijing Military Region Air Force (MRAF) in 1987, and promoted to Commander of the Beijing MRAF and concurrently Deputy Commander of the Beijing Military Region in 1990. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant general in 1988. He retired in January 1993.
Personal life.
In 1956, Yao Xian married Mao Yufang (), a textile worker from Liaoyang, who first saw him on the cover of the "Hangkong" (Aviation) magazine and met him when he went to her factory to give a speech. She had already been admitted to Qingdao Textile Institute, but gave up the opportunity to attend university to marry him.
Death.
Yao Xian died in the morning of 3 March 2018, on the same day as his friend and colleague, fellow Korean War veteran and PLAAF lieutenant general Lin Hu. They were born in the same year and graduated from the same aviation school.

Maria Rogowska-Falska

Maria Rogowska-Falska, also known as Maryna Falska (2 February 1877, Dubno – 7 September 1944, Warsaw) – was a Polish teacher, pedagogue, activist.
Biography.
She was born Maria Rogowska into a noble family in Dubno on 2 February 1877. She spend her early years in Warsaw and Łódź, where she was studying pedagogy and achieved a teaching diploma. After studies she was involved in independence activities of PPS along with her brothers, she was spreading culture and social knowledge among laborers. She was using her alias ‘Hilda’ and was arrested on several occasions for illegal PPS’ printing works at the time. She was imprisoned with Józef Piłsudski. In 1905 she was arrested, incarcerated and exiled in Deep Russia.
She married well-known doctor and social activist Leon Falski, whom she possibly had met in London, where both of them had been hiding from Okhrana. Back in Poland they had a baby-girl and moved to Volozhyn, Lithuania, where Leon started to work as a country doctor, treating Poles, Jews and Lithuanians. In 1912 he died in Volozhyn curing typhoid fever during its outbreak. Maria left for her friends in Moscow, where her daughter died at the age of 2.
From 1917 to 1918, when she was running boarding house for Polish teenagers and children in Kiev, she met Janusz Korczak and implemented his methodology of educational community, based on creation of an emotional bond and a sense of belonging together. In 1918 she came back to Poland and started work on behalf of Ministry of Health as an inspector of children's homes.
In 1919 Maryna Falska along with Janusz Korczak and Maria Powysocka created exemplary orphanage and boarding school Our Home ("Nasz Dom") in Pruszków. Mostly children of laborers who had died during the war were placed in the orphanage. But in time, also social orphans found their home there, because Falska helped all the children in need. Since 1921 the orphanage was under the care of "Our Home" Association; from 1927 to 1929 a plot was bought by its contributions and a new facility was built in Bielany District, Warsaw. The Association was under Aleksandra Piłsudska’s patronage.
Maryna Falska described institutional forms of work carried out by her institution in "Szkic informacyjny o "Naszym Domu"”.
She managed to hide several Jewish children after the outbreak of World War II, i. a. daughter of Salomon Fiszgrund. She also reconnected with Janusz Korczak and offered him help to escape the ghetto (however Korczak rejected her proposition). In January 1943, she hide a manuscript of Korczak's diary- passed on by Igor Newerly's wife after arresting the writer by Germans- in special secret compartment in Our House’ building in Bielany.
She died of a sudden heart attack on 7 September 1944, when Germans forced the evacuation of the orphanage to a transit camp in Pruszków. According to an alternative version given by Antoni Chojdyński - pupil of Our Home and Warsaw Uprising insurgent - she committed suicide by cyanide poisoning.
Decorations and awards.
In recognition of all her work she was decorated with the Gold Cross of Merit, she was also posthumously honored with the Officer's Cross of Polonia Restitutia by the Polish Council of State in 1947.

Judgementall Hai Kya

Judgementall Hai Kya () is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language black comedy film directed by Prakash Kovelamudi, with screenplay by Kanika Dhillon starring Rajkummar Rao and Kangana Ranaut. Produced by Ekta Kapoor, the film was theatrically released in India on 26 July 2019.
Plot.
Bobby is a strange wealthy young woman living alone in Mumbai and working as a dubbing artist. In childhood, she had interfered in a fight between her parents, causing them to fall off the terrace to their deaths. When a producer touches her at work, she reacts by slicing his nose with a knife. She is then sent to an asylum. Her uncle manages her property and offers her house as a rental to a young married couple. Keshav is the husband to Reema. Bobby is obsessed with the couple and spies and stalks them constantly. Reema dies in a fire in the kitchen when a bottle of pesticide explodes. Bobby suspects Keshav and tries to get the police to investigate him but they find no evidence. She hallucinates Keshav threatening her and hits him with a chair in front of the police. She is put back in the asylum. It is revealed that she is imagining things; during electric shock treatment, she remembers that she threw the pesticide on the wife because she hallucinated a cockroach on her.
Two years later, Bobby is taking her meds but not leaving her house. Her cousin in London arranges for Bobby to be an understudy in a re-imagining of the Ramayana that she is helping design. When Bobby meets her cousin's new husband, it turns out to be Keshav. Keshav warns his wife that Bobby is not stable but his wife does not believe him. Bobby starts to lose herself in the character of Sita that she is understudying. She believes Keshav is Raavan and it is up to her to defeat him. Keshav panics and reaches out to her old boyfriend, Varun, who confirms that she obsesses over things and had imagined him to be a criminal. He breaks into her house and finds boxes of photos with Bobby photoshopped in instead of Keshav's wife. A photo of Keshav's wedding to her cousin proves that Bobby knew beforehand that they were married.
Keshav confronts Bobby. The next morning, he tells his wife that Bobby tried to kiss him, and she in turn tells his wife that he tried to rape her. When she later sees Keshav backstage, she grabs an ax and chases him, cutting a rope that sends a light falling. Afraid she has hurt someone, she goes on the run and gains three hallucinatory friends. They take her to a library, where she researches Keshav and thinks she has found evidence that he is a serial killer who takes on new identities and kills his wives. She returns to the house to confront him, dressed as Sita, ties up her pregnant cousin and when Keshav arrives, threatens him. Keshav tries to reason with her before revealing that he IS indeed a serial killer. He even killed his first wife, throwing the match on her after Bobby covered her in pesticide. Bobby fights him and she and her cousin are both saved when Keshav is burnt alive in the same manner in which his victims burned to death. At the end, she strides down the street in London surrounded by her hallucinations proudly declaring that she is what she is and will not change.
Production.
Filming.
Principal photography of the film began on 16 May 2018, in Mumbai. After completing the shooting in Mumbai, the production team went to London for next schedule. The film wrapped on 9 July 2018 in London.
Soundtrack.

Marketing and release.
On 4 March 2018, producer Ekta Kapoor revealed the first two posters of the film on Twitter, each depicting the two leads - a cross-eyed Ranaut and Rao holding up his middle fingers to his eyes; Kapoor hinted at the theme of mental instability by captioning, "It's time to bring out the crazy in you... Because Sanity is overrated!" In an interview, writer Kanika Dhillon called the film a "quirky thriller" 
On 5 March, Balaji Motion Pictures released two more first look posters, depicting both lead characters at crime scenes. The following day, 6 March, another two posters for the film were released, with leads Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao posing in "quirky" and dangerous positions- a knife-wielding Ranaut in a water-filled bathtub surrounded by electronic gadgets at its edge, and Rao holding a butcher knife and cutting an apple, with blood seeping from his hand.
On 11 October 2018, the producers released a new poster, a composite of the original two posters of a cross-eyed Ranaut and Rao holding up his middle fingers, to reveal the film's release date. Release date of the film is changed to 21 June 2019. Rao announced the new date on his Twitter account along with new poster of the film. The release date was further extended to 26 July 2019 on 7 May 2019 by Balaji Motion Pictures.
The film promotions were also wrapped in controversy as the lead actress, Kangana Ranaut, apparently questioned a journalist for his personal remarks about her and also Rani of Jhansi. The incident took an uglier turn as the Entertainment Journalists' Guild of India decided to boycott Kangana Ranaut until she issued an unconditional apology. The producer of the film Ekta Kapoor issued an unconditional apology on behalf of her.
In June 2019, the film's title was changed to "Judgementall Hai Kya" due to objections from Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) which filed a complaint to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) claiming that the original title, "Mental Hai Kya", trivialises mental health issues.
The film has been certified with a runtime of 116 minutes by British Board of Film Classification and was released on 26 July 2019.
Reception.
Critical response.
upon release, "Judgementall Hai Kya" received highly positive reviews from film critics , who praised kangana ranaut's and rajkummar rao's performances. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 62% based on thirteen reviews, with an average rating of 6.67/10.
Stutee Ghosh of The Quint gave 4/5 stars states “The movie is a deliciously addictive ride, showing the world through the eyes of someone who feels like a misfit “, praising lead performances by saying “Kangana and Rajkummar Rao are right up there giving us a rare understanding of their characters emotional and physical state. They ensure you don’t take your eyes off the screen for even a moment “. Raja Sen of "Hindustan Times" gave 4/5 stars and felt that the slick, snappy looking comedy has more to offer, as a 'smart, significant satire'. Praising the performances he said, "This is a finely acted film, with superb performances from Amrita Puri, Satish Kaushik and Jimmy Sheirgill, not to mention Rao, but it rests entirely on Ranaut’s shoulders and she delivers both vitality and credibility." Concluding he recommended to watch the film as 'carrying homilies on placards' and opined, "It is a film about malicious misdirection, and the validity of our narratives — especially those labelled incorrect. It’s okay to jump at a cockroach even if you’re the only one who sees it. A bug can be a feature." Vickey Lalwani of SpotboyE gave the film 4/5 stars stating "How can two actors complement each other so well! They almost take alternate turns to look crazy, vulnerable, innocent and menacing in their respective scenes, which in turns keeps you at the edge of your seat", lauding kangana's performance by saying "This is clearly Kangana Ranaut's best performance till date. Her body language is insanely amazing- the way she walks in several scenes constantly looking behind her shoulder. Her dialogue delivery is flawless- she out-pours just what her character requires. You can make out there's so much of improvisation which she has done beyond what the director demanded".
Sreeparna Sengupta of "The Times of India" gave the film 3.5/5 stars, found Kovelamudi's narrative style as 'quirky and edgy'. Praising performance of Kangana Ranaut, termed it as "brilliant", as for Rajkummar Rao she felt that he fitted into 'his slightly macho, edgy persona like a glove'. Concluding she opines, ""Judgementall Hai Kya" keeps the element of suspense alive all the way till the end, as it pushes the envelope as a dark, psychological whodunit, with a social message weaved in that can’t be ignored." Charu Thakur of India Today gave 3.5/5 stars, praises director kovelamudi by stating "Prakash Kovelamudi deserves applause for pushing the envelope with a quirky thriller that goes beyond the basic realms of a whodunnit, and makes people think and absorb. It treads into a zone Bollywood rarely ventures into", praising the lead actors saying "Kangana is a firecracker in Judgementall Hai Kya. She plays the character to perfection, getting the nuances and quirks right. She brings in a certain childlike vulnerability to Bobby and that's what makes her stand out. Rajkummar holds his ground as an edgy and macho Keshav, and delivers one of his best performances".Koimoi gave 3.5/5 stars stated "All said and done, this isn’t a normal movie. From its treatment to the narrative, everything screams madness. On a brighter side, the story is strong enough to back the wacky side of it. Kangana Ranaut is definitely the queen, but this deck of cards have multiple aces to offer".
Gaurang Chauhan of "Times Now" rating the film with 3/5 stars terms it as 'one of its kind film', praising the performances of lead of Ranaut and Rao and supporting cast of Hussain Dalal, Satish Kaushik and Brijendra Kala says, " This movie belongs to [Ranaut] and she simply nails it." In conclusion, he opines, "Do give this one a try for its uniqueness, eccentricity, jaw-dropping moments, technical brilliance and Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao's phenomenal performances. Watch it." shubhra gupta of The Indian Express gave 3/5 stars and stated "This is the kind of movie which will sharply divide audiences. And that’s as it should be. Once I began seeing it as the murmurings of a different mind, I bought it as a caper, as burlesque, where nothing is as it is. I had problems with some of it, but I really liked the rest of it",praising lead performances saying "Rao plays his part with brio, and Ranaut hits all the notes perfectly". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave 3/5 stars stated “ Kangana is a livewire. There are moments in the film where she appears to be striving too hard to make an impression. But when she is more reined-in, she is in total control. Rajkummar Rao is the exact opposite: baring himself little by little with exceptional control. He is the ideal foil for the out-on-a-limb Kangana. Together, they command total absorption. And that helps the film tide over its less convincing bits and add up in the end to a strong, meaningful statement on the mental distress engendered by abusive relationships”.
Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, "While you admire the attempt at originality, you can’t help feeling frustrated at just how it all comes apart in the end." He praised the performances, and termed Ranaut as solid. But, he felt that the film fell short of greatness because of a muddled script and gave 2.5/5 stars.Anna M. M. Vetticad of "Firstpost" gave the film 2.5/5 stars, found the plot to be confusing and stated that the makers have done very poor research on mental health. The movie, at certain points, makes fun of issues that require serious attention. Psychological disorders are a concern and such toxic take can only push people back. The performances are great, especially that of Rajkumar Rao, who unfortunately is caught in between a poor script. Kangana's performance is also decent but she could have done better.
Publications like The Indian Express The Times of India named kangana ranaut's performance in judgementall hai kya as one of the best performances by female actresses in 2019. Rahul Desai of Film Companion named kangana's performance as one of his favourite Hindi film performances of 2019 
Box office.
According to the "Bollywood Hungama" opening day collection of the film is 4.20 crore and the second day collection is 7 crore, whereas third day collection is 7.70 crore. The opening weekend gross is 26.97 crore worldwide.
, with a gross of 39.42 crore in India and 5.50 crore overseas, the film has a worldwide gross collection of 44.92 crore.

Dragonfly Telephoto Array

The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is a ground-based optical telescope array developed at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics of the University of Toronto in Canada. The array uses a combination of telephoto lenses to observe extragalactic objects.
Its main purpose is to take images of ultra-low surface brightness galaxies at visible wavelengths of light. It is well suited for this purpose because its lenses have specially-coated optical glass that reduces scattered light.
The telescope was designed by Roberto Abraham of the University of Toronto and Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University. It was commissioned in 2013 and initially had eight commercially available Canon EF 400mm f/2.8L IS II USM camera lenses. This was first increased to ten lenses, and was extended to two clusters of 24 lenses each in 2016. The array is designed to accommodate the addition of lenses to increase its effective aperture with each additional lens.
With 48 lenses, the instrument has the light gathering power equivalent to a 99 cm diameter refractor, with a focal length of 40 cm. In March 2021 plans were announced to add 120 more lenses.
Astronomers used the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to discover Dragonfly 44, a galaxy that is roughly as massive as the Milky Way, with 99.9% of its mass composed of dark matter. At the other end of the scale it was also used to discover NGC 1052-DF2 which measurements with other instruments initially suggested was a galaxy with very little dark matter. Further work indicated that NGC 1052-DF2 was closer to the earth than previous thought. If this is the case then the galaxy appears to contain a typical amount of dark matter.

K2-141b

K2-141b (also designated EPIC 246393474.01) is a massive rocky exoplanet orbiting extremely close to an orange main-sequence star K2-141. The planet was first discovered by the Kepler space telescope during its K2 “Second Light” mission and later observed by the HARPS-N spectrograph. It is classified as an Ultra-short Period (USP) and is confirmed to be terrestrial in nature. Its high density implies a massive iron core taking up between 30% and 50% of the planet's total mass.
Characteristics.
Mass and radius.
Like the majority of known exoplanets, K2-141b was detected using the transit method, where a planet blocks a tiny fraction of its star's light as it passed between our line of the sight and its host. This method is only able to determine the radius of the planet, not its mass. However, K2-141b was also detected by the radial velocity method using the HARPS-N spectrograph. Therefore, its mass could also be determined along with its radius. The planet is classified as a Super-Earth, being significantly larger and more massive than Earth but not as large as the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. K2-141b has a radius of 1.51 , below the 1.6 threshold where most planets are expected to accumulate thick hydrogen and helium atmospheres, transforming them into mini-Neptunes. The planet's mass confirms that it is rocky. It has a mass of 5.08 , which gives K2-141b a high density of 8.2 g/cm3, about 1.48 times the density of Earth. This high density implies a composition with a large iron core taking up about 30% to 50% of the planet's total mass.
Orbit.
K2-141b has one of the shortest known orbital periods of any confirmed exoplanet. With an orbital period of only 6.7 hours, it is the shortest-period planet known to date with a precisely determined mass. Only a few planets, including those around Kepler-70, have shorter orbital periods. At this proximity, K2-141b is most likely tidally locked with its host star, meaning that the same side of the planet always faces the star. It has a semi-major axis of 0.00716 +0.00055−0.00065 AU. For a comparison, Mercury's perihelion is 0.307499 AU, more than 41 times farther away from the Sun.
Atmosphere and climate.
Despite its terrestrial nature, K2-141b is far from habitable. Its extremely close proximity to its host star has resulted in an equilibrium temperature of about . However, the actual temperature is probably much higher. About two-thirds of K2-141b faces perpetual daylight. The night side experiences frigid temperatures of below . The day side of the exoplanet, at an estimated , is hot enough to not only melt rocks but vaporize them as well.
K2-141b is believed to have both an atmosphere and oceans, which are magma and likely tens of kilometers deep. The makeup of the atmosphere is unknown but likely consists of vaporized metals which are common in solid form on Earth. The atmosphere is believed to have extreme wind speeds of over 1.75 kilometers per second. Temperatures are high enough that the magma in the oceans can vaporize into the atmosphere. The mineral vapor formed by evaporated rock is swept to the frigid night side by supersonic winds and rocks "rain" back down into a magma ocean. The resulting currents flow back to the hot day side of the exoplanet, where rock evaporates once more. If the planet's atmosphere has high levels of sodium, then solid sodium might slowly slide towards the planet's oceans, similarly to how glaciers move on Earth.
Host star.
K2-141 is an K5 main-sequence star about 61 parsecs (202 light years) away, in the direction of the constellation Pisces. Based on the spectral type (K5/6 D) of the star, the star's colour is orange. It has a radius of 0.681 ±0.018 and a mass of 0.708 ±0.028 . It has a temperature of 4,599 ±79 K and is between 1.6 and 12.9 billion years old. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.5 billion years old.

St. Mary's Beacon

 The St. Mary's Beacon was a weekly newspaper published from December 13, 1839, to June 10, 1983, in Leonardtown, Maryland. Its headquarters was originally located on Washington Street in Leonardtown, a building which was formerly the Old Town Tavern.
History.
The "Beacon" got its origins from the "Leonard Town Herald", which was established by Francis M. Jarboe, and was renamed to the "St. Mary's Beacon" when it was purchased by George Haydn around 1845. In 1852, Haydn sold the "Beacon" to a local attorney, George S. King, who passed on ownership of the paper to his nephew, John Franklin King, just three years later. John King had previously completed an apprenticeship in the 1840s with prominent Baltimore publisher John Murphy.
During the Civil War, the "Beacon" adopted a decidedly pro-Confederate stance, which led to difficulties for King and his co-editor James S. Downs. In April 1863, Downs was arrested and charged with treason for an editorial he published entitled "War Upon Women," which criticized the poor treatment of Confederate sympathizers. He wrote, "We learn that an order has been recently promulgated by Gen. Schenck, military commandant at that port, under which all women 'found guilty of disloyal practices' are to be sent beyond the Federal lines...why such a rigorous sentence should be visited upon them, we cannot divine." The "Beacon" published the following notice in its April 23, 1863 issue: "On Wednesday the 15th inst., Mr. J.S. Downs one of the Editors of the Beacon, by orders of Gen. Lockwood, the military commander in this portion of this Military District, was arrested, for an editorial in the Beacon of the 2nd headed 'War upon Women.' Which was considered by the agent of the Government as treasonable. The paper was suppressed, but on account of the difficulties represented to Major Remington, in command at this point, as regards the legal advertisement, he has kindly consented to the future issue of the paper. Mr. Downs was removed immediately to the Headquarters of Gen. Lockwood, at Point Look Out and was carried the next morning to Baltimore, and delivered in to the hands of the Provost Marshall of this District."
On October 1, 1863, the first issue of the "St. Mary's Gazette" was published by Walter Thompson, signaling the paper's intent to fill the void left by the "Beacon" with the following salutatory: "In view of the great public inconvenience to which the people of this county have been subjected, by the suppression of the Saint Mary's Beacon, I have determined to publish the St. Mary's Gazette, during its further suspension...When the Beacon shall be restored to the good graces of the Government...its publication will most likely be resumed, and, upon its reappearance, the Gazette will be discontinued."
Downs returned from prison in May 1865 and resumed his position as publisher, changing the name of the paper back to the "St. Mary's Beacon" in September 1867. He published a letter to the "Gazette's" readers, promising, "I shall not attempt to define the future political status of this paper, but will simply say to the public, that it will be devoted to what I conceive to be the best interests of those who have heretofore given it so generous a support." However, it is clear that the paper continued to adopt a conservative stance, with a particularly telling editorial published in May 1867 stating, "We pray the negroes a safe deliverance from the selfish white demagogues who are teaching them the ballot is their right, that it is proper they should have it...and that it is better for them to be at radical meetings than to be at work." By 1872, John King's name had reappeared on the paper's masthead along with Downs.
John King's son, Francis Vernon King, took over the paper from his father around 1881. Francis King was a prominent Knight of Columbus as well as an active member of the Democratic Party, described in his obituary as "a man of attractive personality" with "childlike faith and tender piety." He edited and managed the paper up until his death on February 28, 1913, after which he was succeeded by his son, Aloysius Fenwick King. Aloysius was a graduate of University of Maryland School of Law and a prominent lawyer, known as an "old fashioned gentleman, kind, considered, and of exacting honesty in all his business relations."
After running the paper for decades, Aloysius King died on December 21, 1952, and the paper was sold to Speer Publications, run by Talbot T. Speer and Elmer M. Jackson, Jr., who already owned and published the daily newspaper "Evening Capital" in Annapolis, Maryland. In its February 20, 1953 issue, the "Beacon" published a short notice regarding its new management: "Messrs. Speer and Jackson believe in, and publish 'home' newspapers that are welcome to all. Home happenings have replaced the 'canned' material that formerly appeared in Speer newspapers. [...] The BEACON pledges itself to honest reporting and offers news space to all factions, creating news that should be brought to the attention of the people." Speer and Jackson sold the "Evening Capital" to Philip Merrill in 1969, but it is unclear at what point they sold the "Beacon" due to missing newspaper issues.
What is clear is that by 1981, the "Beacon" was owned and published by the Chesapeake Publishing Corporation, who also published the "Maryland Independent" in Waldorf, Maryland.

Stella Zylbersztajn-Tzur

Stella Zylbersztajn-Tzur (born 1925, Łódź) – is a Holocaust survivor, Polish woman of Jewish parentage who contributed to honoring of 23 Poles with title Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. She was a Carmelite nun before she left Poland and also for several years in Israel. She was working as a nurse in Israel, nowadays, she is an activist.
Biography.
She was born and raised in Łódz, attending one of the most expensive all-girl schools, the Eliza Orzeszkowa High School, where the majority of pupils were Jews. Her father Szulim was a communist. In 1939, before World War II began, he had left to the USSR working as an activist and German teacher. He prepared an accommodation and intended to bring his family, but Stella's mother- Haya- was against leaving the country. In her diaries, Stella often emphasized with Polish patriotism of her mother, a common reason of conflict between her parents. Ultimately, their move to the USSR was thwarted by the German Invasion of Poland and train blockade by the Wehrmacht.
In December 1939 Stella's mother decided to move to the USSR because of the increasing anti-Semitic repressions. Both of them managed to get to the border village of Sarnaki upon the Bug river. They got through to Łosice looking for shelter, where Stella's uncle was an inn-keeper before the War. Stella was placed in Łosice Ghetto at the age of 15. She was able to escape it during its liquidation on August 22, 1942. The Majority of Jews from Łosice Ghetto, including Stella's mother, were killed in Treblinka.
Stella survived the war hidden by more than twenty Polish families from Łosice and surrounding villages. She was baptized after World War II. She took her school-leaving exam and in August 1948 she became a Carmelite Sister. She spent 24 years in the nunnery.
In 1969, she moved to Israel after experiencing anti-Semitic prejudices even in the religious community. She stayed in Haifa. She was expelled from the Carmelite nunnery for leaving. Then she became a nurse in a residential home. She helped a lot of Poles in finding a job, when large numbers of Polish emigrants shown in Haifa (what is confirmed by multiple statements).
Nowadays, Stella is helping drug addicts, the homeless and ill, despite her advanced age. She is also an activist in the organization "Women in Black" uniting Israeli and Palestinian women. Stella Zylbersztajn-Tzur is still Catholic, what she emphasizes in many interviews in Poland.
Credits.
Stella contributed to the awarding of 23 Poles that helped her during the war with the title Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem.
Stella's first Righteous were:
– in 1981:
– in 1994:
Legacy and commemoration.
In 2015 biographical movie "Stella" was directed by Maciej Pawlicki about her life. The Official ceremony and projection of the movie was organized in the Presidential Palace in presence of Stella Zylbersztajn-Tzur and president of Poland Andrzej Duda in March 2016.
The film “Stella" was awarded with Janusz Krupski's Award (nagroda im. Janusza Krupskiego) on VII Festiwal Filmowy "Niepokorni Niezłomni Wyklęci" in Gdynia, 2015.
Autobiography.
In 1994, Stella's diary "A gdyby to było Wasze dziecko? …:wspomnienia antysemitki w getcie, komunistki w klasztorze, uniwersalistki wśród Ludu Wybranego, Umiłowanego" was released by the publishing house "Oficyna Bibiofilów".

Sin (2003 film)

Sin is a 2003 American crime thriller film directed by Michael Stevens. It stars Gary Oldman and Ving Rhames, with a supporting cast including Kerry Washington, Alicia Coppola and Chris Spencer. The film, which was released direct-to-video, has been censured by Oldman.
Plot synopsis.
Retired Reno, Nevada police officer Eddie Burns (Rhames) goes in search of his wayward sister Kassie (Washington). Along the way, his past wrongdoings make him the target of a revenge campaign by enigmatic criminal Charlie Strom (Oldman).
Reception.
Critical reaction.
Dominic Wills of "TalkTalk" described "Sin" as "a kind of cross between "Death Wish" and "8mm". "DVD Talk" journalist Shannon Nutt awarded the film two stars out of five, and wrote: "Sin" makes for a decent rental... The plotline is rather predictable and similar to many other cop dramas you'll find out there, but the acting of both Rhames and Oldman put "Sin" just a notch above other releases in the same genre." Forrest Hartman of the "Reno Gazette-Journal" gave the movie a "C-" score, and said: "It lacks the tension and cohesion that might have made it good. Locals may appreciate the nice Nevada backdrops, but there's not much more to recommend." Critic Dennis Schwartz also rated the film "C-", and called it a "weakly directed revenge tale" with "stilted dialogue, a tired story, schematic action scenes, a questionable moral compass and uninspired acting (even from the noted headliners)". "Guardian" writer Xan Brooks felt that with "Sin", Oldman accepted a "barrel-scraping" role at the "low point" of his career.
Oldman's response.
Oldman admitted in a 2005 interview with "Time Out" that he signed onto "Sin" purely for money, as he had not acted in some time and had recently settled a divorce. He said of the film: "Oh God, that's possibly the worst movie ever made. I even felt sorry for the trees they cut down for the script paper... If you're a connoisseur of the terrible, you might get a twisted joy out of it."

Gonatopsis borealis

Gonatopsis borealis, the Boreopacific armhook squid, is a species of squid from the North Pacific Ocean. It is a member of the family Gonatidae. It is an abundant species which is currently caught mainly as a bycatch by fishing boats targeting other quarry. It is an important prey species for many commercially important species of fish, as well as for marine mammals.
Description.
"Gonatopsis borealis" is a medium-sized squid. There are three morphs: large bodied, slender bodied and small bodied; these may be separate taxa, but this needs more research. The main characteristics which distinguish this species from closely related species are that it has transverse rows of seven teeth on its radula, rather short blunt-tipped arms which have four rows of suckers near their tips, and a muscular mantle. The muscular arms are 40-45% of the mantle length and some are longer than others, arms III have well developed aboral keels. Arms I to III have 2 middle series of hooks and 2 marginal series of suckers; arm IV has no hooks and four series of suckers. The development of hooks on the arms does not occur until the animal reaches a mantle length of 35 to 45 mm. There is no hectocotylus. The lose their tentacles at the paralarva stage. They have large eyes and a nuchal crest which has four longitudinal nuchal folds of skin on either side of it. The muscular mantle is cylindrical and tapers to a blunt posterior. The muscular fins are short (40 to 45% of the mantle length), wide (65 to 80% of mantle length) and rhomboid in shape. There is no tail. The skin on the mantle is dark reddish or purplish brown in colour and there are no photophores. Mature males grow to a mantle length of 270mm ML while mature females reach mantle lengths of 330mm.
The paralarvae are distinguished by the pattern of chromatophores on the dorsal part of the head. This consists of three transverse rows of chromatophores with a single chromatophore in the front row, two in the middle row and three in the rear row. They also have 6-10 chromatophores in the dorsal surface of the mantle.
Distribution.
"Gonatopsis borealis" is found in the North Pacific Ocean, where its range extends from northern Japan at a latitude of roughly 37°N to 40°N through the Okhotsk Sea, Bering Sea all along the Aleutian Islands into the Gulf of Alaska, south along the western coast of North America to California, even reaching Baja California at a latitude of 20°N. The type specimen was taken off Hokkaido, some east of Kushiro.
Habitat and biology.
"Gonatopsis borealis" is an oceanic speciesand it is one of the most widely distributed and abundant species of the family Gonatidae. It can be found in cold temperate waters, where it can occur from the surface to the mesopelagic zone, even reaching into the bathypelagic zone. It undertakes a diel vertical migration, moving up the water column at night, and for forming very large aggregations between the Spring and the early autumn, especially in both the eastern and western parts of its range. The abundance of "G. borealis" is indicated by it accounting for up to 68% of squid catches in the Okhotsk Sea during the summer months. G. borealis is found in epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths from the surface to 1500m. It has a benthic habit at 200 to 1 375m, but it is most numerous in the midwater realm, with maximum abundance occurring at 300 to 500m, while only a few single specimens are caught below 1000 m (probably having been caught at much shallower depths while the open nets were retrieved through their zone of most abundance). Off California there were no specimens of any age recorded during the day at depth of less than 300m, and 90% of specimens collected during daylight were from 400 to 700m. By contrast, specimens occurred mainly at 100 to 500m, principally 300 to 400m at night. Smaller animals undertook the diel migration to the surface layers earlier than the larger ones. They also returned to depths sooner, possibly a behavioural adaptation to avoid the larger cannibalistic adults. This species preys on a diverse variety of pelagic crustaceans such as euphausiids, hyperiid amphipods and copepods, as well as fishes and other squid. They live for at least a year. Their predators include fish such as salmonids, walleye Pollock, pomfret, albacore and grenadiers, as well as the larger squid "Berryteuthis magister" and cannibalistic "G. borealis". Other predators include seabirds, seals, sea lions, dolphins and toothed whales, such as sperm whale and pilot whales.
Fisheries.
"Gonatopsis borealis" is an abundant species. In the Sea of Ohotsk in the summer months there is estimated to be a biomass of this species ranging from 278,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes, with estimates of 209,000 tonnes in the western Bering Sea, 285,000 tonnes off the western Kamchatka coast, and 100,000 tonnes in waters around the Kuril Islands. The large morph of this species form the major part of any catch. It is caught as bycatch with jigs, and substantial numbers are caught in drift gillnets which are set to take salmonids and the neon flying squid ("Ommastrephes bartramii"). The meat of this species is said to be highly palatable, and as it is an abundant species it is thought to have a high potential to support fisheries. However, it is the principal prey for many of valuable species of fish, and this ecological role is perhaps more important to local fisheries than any development of a fishery to target this species.
Taxonomy.
"Gonatopsis borealis" differs from other members of the genus "Gonatopsis" in having seven rather than five rows of teeth on the radula. Kir Nesis proposed that it be placed in its own subgenus "Boreoteuthis". Subsequently, this has been treated by some authorities as a separate genus. The generic status of "G. borealis" is yet to resolved, as is the taxonomic status of the three size morphs which have been recorded.
In the Asiatic part of its range, two distinct populations are found, a more northerly population which matures at less than 180mm mantle length, and a more southern population found south of latitude 45°N to 47°N, which reached sexual maturity at larger than 220mm mantle length. The two populations are found sympatrically in the waters off the Kuril Islands.

Terese Marie Mailhot

Terese Marie Mailhot (born 15 June 1983) is a First Nation Canadian writer, journalist, memoirist, and teacher.
Early life and education.
Mailhot grew up in Seabird Island, British Columbia, on the Seabird Island First Nation reservation. Her mother, Wahzinak, was a healer, social worker, poet, and radical activist, and her father, Ken Mailhot, was an artist. Her father had been incarcerated and was an alcoholic who molested Mailhot when she was young, and was often violent. Mailhot's mother had a letter-writing relationship with Salvador Agron, and shared the correspondence with musician Paul Simon, who used them for his Broadway musical, "The Capeman." The role of Wahzinak was portrayed by Sara Ramirez in the musical. She is one of four children. As a child Mailhot had tuberculosis. She was in foster care periodically and eventually aged out of the system.
Mailhot's background is Nlaka'pamux, part of the indigenous First Nations people of the Interior Salish language group in southern British Columbia. Her maternal grandmother, who she was close to, was raised in the brutal Canadian Indian residential school system.
Mailhot got her GED and attended community college. Mailhot graduated with a bachelor's degree in English from New Mexico State University. In 2016, Mailhot received an MFA in fiction from the Institute of American Indian Arts.
Career.
Mailhot was a columnist at "Indian Country Today" and was Saturday Editor at "The Rumpus." She taught English and composition at Dona Ana Community College in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
In 2017, Mailhot became a post-doctoral fellow at the English Department at Purdue University, where she works with the Native American Educational and Cultural Center. Roxane Gay is a colleague there. Mailhot is also a professor at the Institute of American Indian Arts.
In 2018, Mailhot released her debut book, "Heart Berries: A Memoir." "Heart Berries" deals with sexual abuse, trauma, violence, substance abuse, going hungry, being poor, and neglect. Mailhot has said she sees her journey as being one that reflects intergenerational trauma and genocide. She uses the term "Indian sick" to describe the idea of cleansing the heart and mind in a spiritual process, which is how her community often processes these experiences. The title "Heart Berries" comes from a story about the healer O'dimin, the Heart Berry Boy, that an Ojibwe friend who is a language teacher told her. The book received overwhelmingly positive reviews in both popular and specialist sources. In March 2018, actress Emma Watson chose Mailhot's book as one of the monthly selections for her book club on Goodreads. "Heart Berries" is a "New York Times" bestseller.

Little Pink House

Little Pink House is a 2017 American-Canadian biographical drama film written and directed by Courtney Moorehead Balaker and starring Catherine Keener as Susette Kelo. It is based on the events related to "Kelo v. City of New London", a U.S. Supreme Court case in which Kelo unsuccessfully sued the city of New London, Connecticut, for its controversial use of eminent domain.
Plot.
A small-town paramedic named Susette Kelo emerges as the reluctant leader of her working-class neighbors in their struggle to save their homes from political and corporate interests bent on seizing the land and handing it over to Pfizer Corporation. Ambitious academic Dr. Charlotte Wells, president of the fictional "Walthrop College" (in real life, Connecticut College President Claire Gaudiani) persuades the current governor (John G. Rowland, unnamed in the movie) that this could help his public image by increasing tax revenue for the poor. Susette's battle goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and the controversial 5–4 decision in Kelo vs. City of New London gave government officials the power to bulldoze a neighborhood for the benefit of a multibillion-dollar corporation. The decision outraged Americans across the political spectrum, and that passion fueled reforms that helped curb eminent domain abuse.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76%, based on 29 reviews, and an average rating of 6.19/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Little Pink House" rises up on the foundation of Catherine Keener's strong central performance, even if its fact-based story never quite fills in the framework. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
A bipartisan congressional screening of the film was held at the U.S. Capitol.

Isfahan Observatory

The Isfahan Observatory (Persian: رصدخانه اصفهان) or Malikshah Observatory (رصدخانه ملکشاه) was an astronomical observatory constructed during the reign of Sultan Malik Shah I by Omar Khayyam, closing shortly after his death in 1092. It was from the work at the observatory that the Jalali Calendar was adopted. Aside from the work on the calendar, little is known about the purpose of the observatory, as no comprehensive sources from its time period are known to exist about the work performed there.
History.
In 1073, Malik Shah invited the astronomer-poet-mathematician Omar Khayyam to oversee an observatory being constructed in Isfahan. The observatory was completed and began operating in 1074. It was scheduled to operate for thirty years, the length of Saturn's revolution around the Sun. Five years after research began, in 1079, Khayyam revealed his corrected calendar and a zīj (a book used for calculating planetary positions), both named after the Sultan. The observatory operated for eighteen years, closing after operating for a short period without financial backing following the death of Malik Shah in 1092.
Location.
Early articles on the Isfahan Observatory theorized its location to be near Nishapur, Rey, or Merv. However, modern scholars believe the location to be in or near Isfahan. At the time of the founding of the observatory, Isfahan was the capital of the Great Seljuk rulers and enjoyed great prosperity and renown as a result of its favorable geographic position and climate.
Astronomical Advances.
Malik Shah's original intent when ordering the construction of the observatory appears to have been to have observations, such as astronomical tables, named after him. The astronomers he had gathered determined this would take too long (about 30 years) and would soon become obsolete, suggesting calendar reform instead. However, some planetary observations were done, published by Khayyam in "Zīj-i Malik-Shāhī" (Astronomical Handbook with Tables for Malikshah) at the same time as the calendar. The calendar, known as the Maliki or Jamili calendar in honor of Sultan Malik-Shah, was incredibly accurate. It calculated the length of a year with such precision that it had an error rate of one day's error per five thousand years. One notable omission from the work at the Malikshah observatory was astrology. One of Khayyam's students related that Khayyam had never expressed any beliefs in using the stars for prophecy or prediction, so his observatory focused on the physical and mathematical construction of the universe, in a break from the typical astronomical practices of the time.
Staff.
Eight astronomers worked at the observatory. Along with Khayyam, the other known scientists are Abû'l Muẓaffer al Asfizârî, Maymûn ibn Najîb al Wâsitî, Muḥammad ibd Aḥmad al Maʿmûrî Al Bayhaqî, and Abû'l ʿAbbâs al Lawkarî. Some researchers have also suggested Bahrâm and ʿAbd al Raḥmân al Khâzinî were also present, although this is unlikely.
Closure.
The Isfahan Observatory was shut down in 1092, after the death of the sultan Malik-Shah I. Malik-Shah's death was followed by the death of another patron of the observatory, Nizam al-Mulk, who was murdered. Funding was cut off by the Seljuk sultan's wife, who had many disagreements with Mulk and the observatory was closed. Omar Khayyam, who had fallen from favor, stayed on for some time but eventually left his studies there. He would go to continue to work and make contributions in astronomy, mathematics and poetry. Malik-Shah's observatory was the first of many such astronomical observatories in the Islamicate world.
Historical significance.
The thirty-year period for research cited by Khayyam and his team is among the first known. This influenced later generations of astronomers, including Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, who referenced the time frame by his predecessors while founding the Maragheh Observatory. The Isfahan Observatory was also the first royally-funded observatory to enjoy a significant period of operation.

Desiree Lubovska

Desiree Lubovska (June 21, 1893 — 1974), also seen as Desiree Lubowska, was the professional name of American dancer Winniefred Foote.
Early life.
Winniefred Foote was born in Faribault, Minnesota. She changed her name, adopted an accent in her speech, and created a backstory of dancing in Russia; she also said that she studied Egyptian art at the British Museum and became convinced that "angles, sharp corners, such as we find on the ancient tablets of Egypt, where lovely Egyptian women of the early day are portrayed, are only beautiful." She went on a diet and fitness regimen in pursuit of a more angular physique, and her dances reflect this focus. "I finally felt I was one of them, a reincarnated spirit of the Nile."
Career.
Lubovska started the short-lived but ambitious National American Ballet company in 1921. The national ballet program was housed on a farm in Hightstown, New Jersey.
The school was later relocated to Arlington, Virginia, with her mother Blanche E. Foote as the school's business manager.
In 1918 Lubovska appeared as "Night" in the "musical spectacle" "Everything" with music by Irving Berlin and Philip Sousa, at the Hippodrome in New York. Also at the Hippodrome, in 1920, she danced at a benefit for the Serbian Child Welfare Association. In 1921, Lubovka sued V. Vivaudou, an American talcum powder manufacturer, for using an image of her "in scant attire" in a newspaper advertisement. That year, she danced at the International Silk Exposition in New York, embodying "The Spirit of Silk", beginning with a burst from a cocoon. Also in 1921 she danced at meetings of the National Garment Retailers' Association and the New York League of Advertising Women, performing at the latter "a satire on modes and manners." In 1922 she was touring in South America.
She appears in the silent film "Greater Than Fame" (1920).
Personal life.
Desiree Lubovska had a son, Joseph Willard Schutz, born in 1912. She died in 1974, aged 80 years.

<doc id="56758497" url="?curid=56758497" title="The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment">
The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment

The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (Ukie) is a non-profit trade association for the video game industry in the United Kingdom (UK). Ukie was originally founded as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), and then later Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), before changing to Ukie in 2010.
History.
The association was founded in 1989, though then named as the European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA). Around 2002, the organisation changed its name to Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, reflecting that their primary concerns were video game development on the United Kingdom islands and not mainland Europe.
In March 2010, members of the ELSPA voted to rename the association as Ukie, reflecting "the evolving and expanding nature of the industry, which the association exists to represent, and to encompass the new areas of activity that will be undertaken". The name was fully changed by September 2010.
In 2011, Ukie proposed a merger with The Independent Game Developers' Association (TIGA), a UK trade association for video game developers, to consolidate the two organisations under one trade body to represent the entire UK games industry. However TIGA's board rejected the proposal. TIGA's stance remained unchanged when a merger proposal was raised once again in 2013.
Activities.
Ukie's primary goal is to represent the UK's video game industry, and as of December 2017, represented over 395 video game companies worldwide. The association provides strategy and advice for developers and publishers, collects and publishes retail date for UK video game sales, and lobbies and meets with members of the government to help establish policy related to video games.
One of its more notable activities was to help petition the UK government to use the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system rather than the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Prior to 2012, video games were exempted from being required to be rated by BBFC, unless they contained sexual content, nudity, or violence, though developers and publishers could voluntarily submit their works for review. Works that exceeded certain ratings could not be legally sold to minors. The ELSPA worked with the Video Standards Council (VSC), a government organization that was created to form a code of practice for how to inform consumers about content ratings in games and other video formats. ELSPA had recommended that as an industry standard, any game not needing classification by BBFC to be otherwise classified under the PEGI system, with the VSC helping to determine appropriating ratings.
In March 2008, Dr. Tanya Byron published a report commissioned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, colloquially called the Byron Review, describing potentially harmful effects of video games on children, a debate over how to better label video games arose, and recommended that parents need to be given more information than the BBFC's rating alone. ELSPA along with other concerned groups believed that the BBFC lacked the clarity needed for video game ratings; current CEO Mike Rawlinson also said that the BBFC ratings were developed for linear content, while PEGI's were better reflective of interactive content such as video games. In 2008, ELSPA started a large push to getting PEGI as the approved system, while in the interim petitioning the BBFC to color-code its ratings labels to approach the same color-coding used by PEGI. The UK Parliament passed the Digital Economy Act 2010 into law, and required by July 2012 to transfer the rating of video games from BBFC to the VSC (outside of games that contain strong pornographic content) and officially adapting the PEGI rating system, along with legal enforcement of selling mature titles to minors. The associate continued to work with the VSC to help establish how the PEGI rating should be displayed on packaging and other materials, and provide awareness to consumers and parents of the new change.
Ukie has campaigned and lobbied for the availability of tax relief for the UK games sector for many years. In 2012, they offered recommendations to the government consultations based on responses and opinions from over 200 video games companies in the country. A tax incentive scheme was scheduled to be included in the March 2010 United Kingdom budget by the outgoing Labour government, however it was not finalised and introduced until 2014 when the European Commission approved the decision. The tax relief scheme allows video games developers and companies to claim back up to 20% of their production costs if the project meets certain conditions, resulting in an estimated £188 million per year for the UK games industry. In 2017, the European Commission granted an extension to the scheme for another six years until 2023.

Life.
Little is known about Oleg Tamarin's life. Born into the second revolution of 1928, his music was reportedly censored by the regime of Joseph Stalin for having characteristics that were considered to be against the preferred socialist realist style of the time. Although the Association for Contemporary Music did not acknowledge his early contributions, Dmitri Shostakovich, Association of Contemporary Musicians, Prokofiev and Khachaturian may have expressed early interest in the composer.

Paulasterias tyleri

Paulasterias tyleri is a species of starfish in the family Paulasteriidae. It is found in deep water at hydrothermal vents in the Antarctic. It is the type species of the newly erected genus "Paulasterias", the only other member of the genus being "Paulasterias mcclaini".
History.
"Paulasterias tyleri" was discovered during a deep sea research cruise organized by the National Oceanography Centre. It was the first starfish to be found living as part of a hydrothermal vent community and was not closely related to any known starfish species so that it was placed in a new family. Its nearest living relative lives in the Ross Sea on the other side of the Antarctic continent some two thousand miles away.
Description.
"Paulasterias tyleri" is a seven-armed starfish and is whitish or pale pink. It has a thick fleshy skin on the aboral (upper) surface, with spongy tissue underneath it. The skin is rough, being clad with short spines.
Distribution.
"Paulasterias tyleri" is found at thermal vents in the East Scotia Ridge to the east of the southern tip of South America where the depth is about .
Ecology.
Starfish are unable to cope with the hot, sulphurous, toxic environment of the hydrothermal vent itself but they are present in the cooler, cleaner water nearby. Hoff crabs live adjacent to the hydrothermal vent chimneys, with gastropod molluscs and then goose barnacles occupying zones further out. Beyond this is an assemblage dominated by sea anemones, and it is on these and on the goose barnacles that the starfish probably feed. Other members of the community surrounding the vents include limpets in the genus "Eclipidrilus" and sea spiders in the genus "Sericosura". However absent from these vents are the giant tube worms ("Riftia pachyptila") which dominate other hydrothermal vents.

Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency

The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (, ) is a government department of the Prime Ministry of Turkey. TİKA is responsible for organization of the bulk of Turkey's official development assistance to developing countries, with a particular focus on Turkic countries and communities. According to the OECD, 2020 official development assistance from Turkey increased by 1.2% to US$8 billion.
Mission.
TIKA's objectives can be summarized as;
History.
With the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Turkic countries in Central Asia gained their independence (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan).
This paved the way for the resurgence of dual relations between Turkey and these countries. Sharing a common language, history, culture and ethnicity with these countries, developing these relations has been a permanent focus for Turkey. There was a need to establish an organization in order to fund, develop and coordinate activities and projects in a variety of different fields. The Turkish Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) in 1992 was established for this purpose.
Early years 1992–2000.
TIKA Programme Coordination offices were set up in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Numerous projects in the fields of education, agriculture, industry and finance were undertaken. The main focus in these early years was on educational and social projects in Central Asia such as the construction of schools, universities, libraries and providing scholarships to students and public officials to study in Turkey.
Expansion 2000–2010.
In this era, TIKA was developed to become an integral part of Turkish Foreign Policy. Its activity area was enlarged to encompass the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. The number of programme coordination offices more than doubled from 12 offices in 2002 to 28 in 2010. Focus began to shift from direct aid provision to technical assistance, institutional capacity building and human development activities. More than 100 projects were implemented in 25 countries in 2010.
By the end of the decade, the destination of the majority of aid and assistance had shifted from Turkic countries to Africa. During this decade, development aid provided by Turkey reached US$1.273 billion.
2010-2019.
During this period, activities have been expanded into Latin America as well as the wider Asian region. In 2014 year in the framework of the partnership of TIKA TATİP Turkey-Azerbaijan-Tanzania Cooperation Health Program, Doctors of the World association and Azerbaijan volunteer doctors, Doctors of the World association, Azerbaijan volunteer doctors and The Fund of Aid for Youth (Azerbaijan) as well as with the assistance of doctors Bahruz Guliyev, Imran Jarullazada, Qoshqar Mammadov and within the support of Tanzania REHEMA Foundation realized cataract surgery of more than 100 Tanzanian patients and more than 100 patients underwent eye examinations. As of 2015, TIKA has programme coordination offices in 42 countries.
Top aid destinations have been Tunisia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Chad, North Macedonia and Kyrgyzstan.
Activities and projects in 2015 included
After 2020.
TİKA has supported many countries fight against COVID-19, such as Palestine, &amp; Uganda.
In South Africa TİKA supported Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria with 10,000 N95 face masks to be used by frontline health workers to curb the spread of the novel Coronavirus
TIKA also provided protective gear in Lesotho to help the Southern African Kingdom curb the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The donated equipment was used in hospitals and clinics by medical staff and by community health workers in the remote rural areas of Lesotho.
In order to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Eswatini, TİKA assisted the Ministry of Tinkhundla Administration by donating embroidery machines to be used in the production of face masks.

Iraq Central FA Cup

The Iraq Central FA Cup was a regional knockout cup competition organised by the Iraq Central Football Association (IFA) in the 1973–74 season for teams from Baghdad and its neighbouring cities. Only one edition was played because the IFA decided to bring back the national cup tournament, the Iraq FA Cup, to be the primary knockout cup competition in Iraqi football. The tournament was won by Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, beating Al-Sikak Al-Hadeed 2–1 in the final.
Al-Jamiea were banned from competing in the tournament by the IFA due events that took place in, and their withdrawal from, their match against Al-Kahrabaa B in a second-tier league game.

Das Boot (TV series)

Das Boot is a German television series produced for Sky One and a sequel to "Das Boot" (1981). Like the film, the series is based on Lothar-Günther Buchheim's 1973 book "Das Boot", but with additions from Buchheim's 1995 sequel "Die Festung". As the original film's plot ends in December 1941, the series' setting takes place nine months later, in 1942. The storyline is split into two narratives, one based on land around the French Resistance, the other set around German U-boat and its crew.
Plot.
The series, set in 1942, focus on the narratives of the upcoming Resistance in La Rochelle and the claustrophobic life aboard .
Production.
In June 2015, it was announced that a television series adaptation based on the 1981 World War II submarine warfare film "Das Boot" would be made. In July 2016, it was announced that it would be a sequel in the form of an 8-part television series, directed by Andreas Prochaska. The series would be produced by Bavaria Fiction, Sky Deutschland, and Sonar Entertainment.
The cast for the series was announced in September 2017. Production began in November 2017 and ended in July 2018. Malta, Germany (Munich), France (La Rochelle), and Czech Republic (Prague) were chosen for the location shooting, which started on 31 August 2017 and finished after 105 days on 20 February 2018. The budget was $32.8 million.
Like the original film, the series is based on Lothar-Günther Buchheim's 1973 book "Das Boot", but with additions from Buchheim's 1995 sequel "Die Festung".
The submarine used in filming the series was the non-diving replica built in Malta as the 'modified' "S-33" for the film "U-571", also shot in Malta. Footage, sets and models from that movie have been reused for other productions, including "Submerged", depicting the loss of , and the fictional HMS "Scorpion" in "Ghostboat". The replica is still afloat, moored at Cassar ship repair yard, Marsa in the inner part of the Grand Harbour. A special rig was built for the production by a Maltese armoury team, that allowed the submarine's anti-aircraft gun to both fire and recoil, something not done before with a blank-firing gun.
The series premiered on 23 November 2018 on Sky One in Germany. The broadcast rights were sold into more than 100 countries before the series premiered. The series was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the United Kingdom in February 2019. The series made its United States premiere through Hulu on 17 June 2019.
In December 2018, plans for a second season were announced.
Filming for season 2 took place in the Czech Republic April - June 2019, and June - July 2019 in Malta. Clemens Schick, Thomas Kretschmann, Michael McElhatton and Ulrich Matthes joined the cast for the second season.
Critical reception.
Season 1 is Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with an overall rating of 84%. The Critics Consensus reads, "Das Boot possesses the atmospheric pressure of its cinematic forebear while adding new depth to its compelling ensemble, making for a riveting international production."
The series received more mixed reviews in Germany. German historian Sven Felix Kellerhoff criticizes especially the plot around the industrial family Greenwood and their financial ties with Nazi Germany. According to Kellerhoff, this could be seen as a way to German guilt. Kathleen Hildebrandt from the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung recognizes that women have a central part but thinks that their portrayal often is too much of a cliché. Hildebrandt sees a highly professional and glittering product which probably will be watched by many but she states that the series could have been more original and relevant if it hadn't cared so much about getting good audience numbers. Thomas Klein (Berliner Zeitung) writes that there are no Nazis in "Das Boot", that no one is screaming "Heil Hitler" and that convinced party members are nowhere to be seen. According to Klein, "Das Boot" is emphasizing internationally common and smooth drama. He thinks that it is obvious that this series is not so much about German history but more about the commercialization of a famous brand. He closes his review by quoting the character Greenwood: "War is nevertheless just a rip-off" and states: "That is exactly the way [...] 'Das Boot' feels like".

Lyudmila Trut

Lyudmila Nikolayevna Trut (Russian: Людми́ла Никола́евна Трут, born 6 November 1933) is a Russian geneticist, ethologist, and evolutionist. She is known for developing domesticated silver foxes from wild foxes with Dmitry Belyayev at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia. The experiment, started in 1952, continues to this day covering nearly 60 generations of silver foxes selected for "tameness." She has held the positions of Senior researcher for Evolutionary genetics, Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB AS USSR, from 1969 to 1985; Head of Laboratory for Evolutionary Genetics, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, USSR, 1985 to 1990; Main Scientific Employee in the Laboratory for Evolutionary Genetics, Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB AS USSR, 1990 until the present; and Professor in Genetics, 2003 to the present at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. Today she coordinates educational activities at the experimental fox farm at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk, Russia. Trut was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020.
Education.
Lyudmila grew up in the town of Kirzhach in Vladimir, Russia Region of the Soviet Union, now Russia. She went to elementary school there, as well as high school. She graduated with Honors at Moscow State University in 1958, majoring in Biology. In 1966 she earned a Candidate of Sciences Ph.D.; her Thesis was titled: "On correlation of behavior characteristics with reproductive function in fur bearing animals of the Canidae family" from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk. In 1981 she earned a Doctor of Sciences Ph.D.; her Thesis was titled: "The role of behavior in the transformation of silver foxes during domestication" also from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk.
Research.
The domesticated silver fox is a form of the silver fox which has been domesticated - to some extent - under laboratory conditions. The silver fox is a melanistic form of the wild red fox. Domesticated silver foxes are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species, as described by Charles Darwin in "On the Origin of Species". The experiment explored whether selection for behaviour rather than morphology may have been the process that had produced dogs from wolves, by recording the changes in foxes when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed. Many of the descendant foxes became both tamer and more dog-like in morphology, including displaying mottled or spotted coloured fur.
Today, the experiment is under the supervision of Lyudmila Trut.

Upton-Morgan State Forest is a state forest in Concord, New Hampshire. It has a short interpretive trail. 
It is located in the southwest part of Concord off Silk Farm Road and is bordered to the northwest by New Hampshire Route 13 (Clinton Street) and to the northeast by Interstate 89. Skunk cabbage ("Symplocarpus foetidus") grows in the area.
In 1835, several Concord entrepreneurs bought the property, the Ballard Haselton farm, in order to raise silk worms, and planted mulberry trees on the land. The silk farm failed after a few years, though the name is preserved in the road that runs past the entrance to the forest. The land was later bought by David Morgan and Mark Upton, who transferred it to the State of New Hampshire in 1917 for the use of the State Asylum. The land was transferred to the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands in 1972.

Psalm Wooching

Psalm Fa'afoisia Pulemagafa Wooching (born January 16, 1994) is an American rugby union player who plays for the United States men's national team. He also currently plays for the San Diego Legion in the Major League Rugby (MLR). 
He has previously played for the USA Selects and Seattle Saracens. Prior to his career in rugby, Wooching played college football for the University of Washington Huskies, playing as a fullback and linebacker. Despite significant interest from NFL teams, Wooching announced that he would be pursuing a career in professional rugby, and not football, ahead of the 2017 NFL draft. Wooching made his debut for the United States men's national rugby team in 2018 in the Americas Rugby Championship.
Early life.
Wooching is a Hawaiian of Samoan descent. He first played rugby as a youth before being introduced to football in high school.
College football career.
Wooching redshirted his true freshman season for the Washington Huskies in 2012. Originally recruited as a fullback, Wooching was eventually converted to linebacker and made contributions both on defense and special teams. In his junior season (2015), he played in all 13 games and recorded two tackles in the 2015 Heart of Dallas Bowl—a 44–31 victory over Southern Mississippi. In his senior season (2016), he played in all 14 games, starting 13, and had 42 total tackles, with two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery. Following the regular season, he received an honorable mention to the 2016 All-PAC-12 Conference Team. He served as a captain for the Huskies at the 2016 Peach Bowl in that season's College Football Playoff semifinal. He made three tackles and forced one fumble in that game—a 24–7 loss to the University of Alabama.
On February 16, 2017, after the conclusion of his senior season with Washington, Wooching announced his intention to forego a potential career in the NFL and pursue a career in professional rugby. In his announcement about the decision, he described rugby as his "first love" and the first sport that he ever excelled in.
Club rugby career.
Early career.
After his announcement that he would be pursuing a career in professional rugby, Wooching participated in a tryout with French club Pau. In May 2017, Wooching signed a contract for a trial at Harlequin F.C. as a member of their World Club 10s squad. Also in 2017, Wooching had a brief stint with Hong Kong Scottish, playing as a hooker for their GFI Hong Kong Tens squad. In 2016 and 2017, he played for Seattle Saracens in the CDI Premier League of the British Columbia Rugby Union. 
Rugby Viadana.
In March 2018, Wooching signed a contract to play for Rugby Viadana in the Italian Eccellenza for the 2018–19 season. In June 2018, it was announced that Wooching's contract with Viadana had been cancelled by mutual consent due to "physical problems". 
San Diego Legion.
In late 2018, Wooching signed with the San Diego Legion of Major League Rugby for the 2019 season.
International rugby career.

Wooching scored his first try in international play on October 11, 2017, in a 49–36 Americas Pacific Challenge victory over Uruguay. In September 2018, it was announced that Wooching had been selected for the Selects roster for the 2018 Americas Pacific Challenge.
USA Eagles.
Wooching made his debut with the USA Eagles on February 17, 2018, starting at flanker in the Eagles' 45–13 victory over Chile in the Americas Rugby Championship. Wooching scored his first try for the Eagles as a substitute in the Eagles' 61–19 victory over Uruguay on March 3, 2018.

Widdecke received the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat, for his actions during the Recapture of Guam in July 1944. He later commanded the 1st Marine Division at the end of Vietnam War.
Early years and World War II.
Charles F. Widdecke was born on May 11, 1919, in Bryan, Texas, the son of Henry A. Widdecke and his wife Josephine Baker. He attended high school in Dallas in 1937 and then graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in June 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at university, Widdecke was named a Phi Beta Kappa and also enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in May 1941.
After graduation, Widdecke attended the Officer Candidate School at the Marine Corps School in Quantico. After completing his courses he was commissioned in the Marine Corps Reserve as a second lieutenant on November 1, 1941. He was then ordered to the Reserve Officer Course, also at Quantico. While he was on this course, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
Widdecke then served as a recruiting officer in San Antonio, Texas, until April 1942, when he joined the 2nd Raider Battalion at San Diego under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson. He was also integrated in the regular Marine Corps during that time.
With the activation of 22nd Marine Regiment under Colonel John T. Walker, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and appointed commander of Headquarters Company of 1st Battalion. His unit subsequently sailed to Samoa, in the South Pacific, at the end of June 1942 and served as a jungle training unit until February 1944. During that time, Widdecke was promoted to captain and was appointed commander of 1st Battalion's Company C.
The 22nd Marines were ordered to take part in the assault on Eniwetok Atoll on February 22 and Widdecke led his company ashore on Parry Island under heavy enemy mortar and machine gun fire. With his men, he participated in a headlong attack against the entrenched Japanese. For his gallantry in action, Widdecke was decorated with the Silver Star and also received the Navy Unit Commendation.
After the battle, Widdecke and his regiment were ordered to Guadalcanal for rest and further training in April 1944. The 22nd Marines were now attached to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd.
The 1st Brigade received orders to take part in the assault on Guam in July 1944. The regiment landed on Guam on July 21 as the left flank of the invasion force. Widdecke and his men secured a position on the beach in the face of strong opposition and prepared for the attack against the fanatic Japanese holding Orote Peninsula and its strategic airfield. Under his leadership, his company sustained the momentum of the subsequent attacks despite the bitterness of the action and the many casualties sustained by his Marines. With his company's advance disrupted by heavy machine-gun, rifle, artillery and mortar barrages, on July 25, Widdecke organized his men led them in a charge through heavy fire. The Japanese position was captured although Widdecke was himself seriously wounded.
Widdecke was decorated with the Navy Cross, the second highest decoration in bravery and was ordered to the field hospital. His wounds required special treatment and he was evacuated to the United States for further hospitalization in September 1944. He remained in the Naval Hospital in San Diego until March 1945.
Postwar career.
After recovering from his wounds, for which he received a Purple Heart, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of major. He was subsequently attached to the Division of Reserve at Headquarters Marine Corps. He served under Major General William T. Clement until February 1948, when he was sent to Quantico to attend the Junior Course at Marine Corps School. On completing the course in August 1948, he sailed for Guam, where he was appointed assistant chief of staff for personnel within 1st Provisional Marine Brigade under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig. In April 1949, Widdecke was posted to Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, also at Guam, as assistant chief of staff for personnel.
In June 1950, Widdecke was ordered back to the United States and appointed an instructor in the Tactical Operations Group, Marine Corps Educational Center, at Quantico. While in this capacity, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in November 1951. Widdecke remained at Quantico and served as an instructor in the Tactics section, Senior Course from July 1952 to August 1953. This assignment ended, when he was ordered to the Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas for regular courses.
Widdecke graduated in June 1954 and immediately left for Korea, where he assumed command of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division. However, the armistice was already in effect and he took part only in the defense of Korean Demilitarized Zone. In January 1955, he was appointed commander of the Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division. Two months later, he returned with the division to Camp Pendleton. His next duties brought him to Washington, D.C., in July 1955, when he was appointed assistant director of Marine Corps Institute and commanding officer of the institute's detachment. Widdecke remained in this capacity only until January 1956, when he was chosen by Commandant Randolph M. Pate as his Aide-de-Camp.
He left Washington in July 1958 and returned to San Diego, where he assumed duties as the commanding officer of the 1st Recruit Training Battalion at Marine Corps Recruit Depot. Widdecke served later as executive officer of Recruit Training Command there and was promoted to the rank of colonel in July 1960. He left California in August 1961 in order to attend Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. He graduated in June 1962 and also attended off-duty educational courses at George Washington University in order to complete a Master of Arts degree in International Affairs.
He was then ordered to Panama and spent the next three years as head of the military assistance, plans and policy, Joint Staff of United States Southern Command under General Andrew P. O'Meara. During his time there, Widdecke was engaged in the administration of military and economic aid to South American countries and received the Joint Service Commendation Medal for this service.
Vietnam War.
In August 1965, Widdecke assumed command of the 5th Marine Regiment at Camp Pendleton and supervised its deployment to Okinawa, Japan in early 1966. The 5th Marines were stationed in Japan until the end of May of that year, when Widdecke led them to Da Nang in South Vietnam. During July 1966, the commanding general of 1st Marine Division, Lewis J. Fields, planned and ordered Operation Colorado. The main objective of this search and destroy operation was to locate and destroy units of the 2nd North Vietnamese Division in the Quảng Nam Province.
He later acted as chief of staff, Task Force X-Ray under Brigadier General William A. Stiles in the Chu Lai area and took part in combat with Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops. Widdecke served in Vietnam until the end of December 1966 and received the Legion of Merit with "V" Device and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam.
Widdecke was posted to Honolulu, Hawaii, and appointed chief of staff, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific under Lieutenant General Victor H. Krulak. While in this capacity, Widdecke was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.
In September 1968, Widdecke was transferred to the Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C. and relieved Major General Clifford B. Drake as director of Marine Corps Reserve. During his tenure, he was responsible for the administration of all reserve marine troops, which were used as reinforcements for combat units in Vietnam. He was also promoted to the rank of major general on August 7, 1969, and received his second Legion of Merit for his service in this capacity.
However Widdecke was ordered back to Vietnam in April 1970, when the commander of 1st Marine Division, Edwin B. Wheeler, suffered serious injuries in a helicopter crash. Widdecke was appointed his substitute.
Widdecke oversaw Operation Imperial Lake during September of that year with the task of destroying North Vietnamese troops in Que Son. During that operation the Son Thang massacre occurred. Controversy arose when Widdecke reduced the sentences of the two convicted Marines from five years and life imprisonment respectively to one year of prison. He later led Operation Catawba Falls against communist forces in the same region. Following the operations in Quảng Nam Province in the fall-winter period of 1970, Widdecke began preparing 1st Marine Division for redeployment to the United States.
The 1st Marine Division arrived at Camp Pendleton on April 30, 1971, where it was welcomed by President Richard Nixon and a crowd of 15,000 spectators. Following the President's speech, Widdecke turned over the command to Brigadier General Ross T. Dwyer and personally assumed command of I Marine Amphibious Force, which controlled Marine air and ground units on the West Coast. For his second tour of duty in Vietnam, Widdecke was decorated with Navy Distinguished Service Medal and several decorations from the Government of South Vietnam.
Widdecke retired from the Marine Corps on July 1, 1971, after 30 years of military service. He died on May 13, 1973, while on a trip to La Paz, Mexico, two days after his 54th birthday. He was survived by his wife and a brother, Henry August Widdecke Jr. who served in the United States Navy.

John Willes-Johnson

John Samuel Willes-Johnson (3 July 1793 – 25 July 1863) was a British Conservative Party politician and naval officer.
Family.
Willes-Johnson was born in Southstoke, Somerset to Charles Johnson and Mary Willes, daughter of the Archdeacon of Wells, William Willes. He married Elizabeth de Windt, Vicomte Campt de Rastignac, daughter of John de Windt, in Paris, in 1821, and they had one child: Elizabeth Sarah Johnson (1825–1870).
After Elizabeth's death in 1842, he remarried to Joanna Burn Smeeton in 1849, but she died five years later in 1854.
Willes-Johnson again remarried in 1858, this time to Margaret Ann Pugh, daughter of David Pugh and Ann née Vaughan, and they had one child: Maud Felicia Frances Ann Johnson (1862–1919).
Naval career.
Entering the navy in 1807, Willes-Johnson became a first class volunteer serving on the "Vestal" under Captain Edwards Lloyd Graham for two years at Home and Newfoundland stations. Becoming a master's mate in 1809, he was then placed in charge of the merchantman "Fortitude", deploying the ship at Lisbon and Cadiz. During his travels, he succeeded in a "ruse de guerre", causing an enemy's armed vessel to sheer off despite not possessing a gun on board on the ship.
Willes-Johnson then returned to England, where his arrival was received for three months on the "Port Mahon" sloop captained by Villiers Francis Hatton. In August 1810, he returned to the seas with Graham on the "Pallas", heading for the coast of Norway where he aided in the capture of four Danish privateers and several merchantmen.
Willes-Johnson and Graham then sailed together on the "Southampton" and "Alcmène", the latter of which he went on to the Adriatic Sea where he was involved in a number of boat affairs. One such occasion in 1812 included capturing a Franco-Venetian trabaccolo, including four guns and 30 men, near Lessina Island after a conflict in which many of the enemy's crew were killed, while just four British were slain.
Leaving the "Alcmène" in 1813, he joined the "Pylades" sloop with Captain James Erskine Wemyss, before he then became acting-Lieutenant of the "Caledonia" bearing the flag of the late Lord Exmouth. Willes-Johnson then went on half-pay in 1814, before returning to full pay in 1815. After this he sailed with the "Boyne", visiting Naples, Marseille and the Barbary States, and "Queen Charlotte", on which he participated in the bombardment of Algiers.
He then had a short further period of half-pay, before being nominated in 1817 to be Flag-Lieutenant to the "Impregnable" at Plymouth where he remained until promoted to Commander in 1821.
Then, in 1835, he joined Her Majesty's Coastguard for 3 years; and in 1841, he commanded the "Wolverine" on its voyage to China where he arrived towards the end of the First Opium War. Retiring from active service in 1842, he was made Captain Post in 1847, and a little Captain before retiring altogether in 1847.
Writing.
Willes-Johnson also wrote at least one literary work — "A Journal of a Tour through parts of France, Italy and Switzerland, in the years 1823-4" — published in 1827.
Political career.
Willes-Johnson was elected MP for Montgomery at a by-election in 1861, caused by the death of David Pugh, and held the seat until his own death in 1863.

The Absentee (1915 film)

The Absentee is a 1915 American silent allegory film directed by Christy Cabanne and starring Robert Edeson, A. D. Sears, and Olga Grey. It was released on May 8, 1915.
Plot.
In a prologue, the mythical figure of Ambition seeks to attain the position currently held by Success. Success has reached the pinnacle of his desire, and sits looking over his kingdom. Having achieved his success, Success decides to take a break and goes off with Pleasure, leaving Might in control of the land. Might, under the influence of Evil, along with Might's wife Extravagance, as well as by his daughter Vanity, begins to abuse the land's occupants, including Toil, Age, Strength, Innocence, Happiness, and Ambition. Spurred on by Evil, who says that Justice is blind and cannot see what he is doing, Might whips the laborers. However Justice is not blind, and she learns of the situation, informing Success, who returns and sets the situation right again.
In current time, Nathaniel Crosby (who is the embodiment of Success in the prologue) is the sole owner of a prosperous factory. After receiving a letter from his general manager telling him that he needs to take a vacation, and can trust him to take care of things while he is away, he decides to take a holiday. Leaving his general manager, Sampson Rhodes (the personification of Might) in charge, he starts out on an extended pleasure trip. Rhodes is influenced by his wife (the personification of Extravagance) and Genevieve, his daughter (the personification of Vanity), to take advantage of his position to increase their wealth and social position. Rhodes lowers the workers' wages, so he can take a bigger cut of the profits. The workers retaliate by going on strike, and the police are called in to protect the plant. Tom Burke (the embodiment of Ambition) can no longer financially support his ill mother since he is striking. Neither can he go through with plans to marry David Lee's (the embodiment of Contentment), the foreman's, older daughter Happiness. Lee, along with several other laborers, become more and more discontent as the strike continues, and they eventually turn the strike into a riot. In the first assault several of the workers, as well as one of the policemen, are killed.
As the violence continues to escalate, Rhodes realizes that it has gone beyond the abilities of the police to handle, and calls in the militia to put down the riot. However Rhodes secretary, Ruth Farwell (the embodiment of Justice), tracks down Crosby and tells him of the situation. When he is reticent to return, telling her that Rhodes can handle the situation, she explodes at him, letting him know that over a dozen have been killed in the riots and that their blood will be on his head. She then runs from the room, dropping one of her gloves. Rhodes returns to the plant in order to defuse the situation, but when Ruth recognizes him as he approaches the factory, the rioters turn their ire on him, beginning to beat him. Ruth, along with Burke, manage to get him away from the crowd and into a nearby boarding house.
Recovering from his daze, he asks Ruth what is happening, she simply points out the window, where they can see the mob approaching the militia, which is standing in a line, weapons at the ready. They have been given the authority by Rhodes to fire on the crowd if necessary to protect the factory. Crosby rushes out of the room, followed by Ruth. In the ruckus which follows, Ruth is shot when she steps in front of a bullet meant for Crosby, fired by Lee. Crosby ends the riot by telling them men to come back to work at their prior wages, which is what they wanted. The militia is dismissed, and Crosby fires Rhodes.
With the plant returned to its former status, Crosby goes to visit Ruth in the hospital where she has been convalescing. She assures him that she can return to work soon, telling him that she's been practicing her shorthand, showing him her pad and pencil. He asks her to take a letter for him, thanking someone for opening his eyes, and asking her to marry him. When Ruth asks him to whom she should address the letter, he takes out the glove she left behind when she came to tell him of the riots, and says simply, "To the owner of this glove".
Production.
In early April 1915 it was announced that Cabanne was working on allegorical film titled "The Absentee" which he also co-wrote with Frank E. Woods. At one point during filming, Robert Edeson forgot that he was acting and broke up a mob during filming. However, the script had called for the mob to turn him back, so the scene had to be re-shot. Cabanne had completed filming by April 1915. On May 1, it was announced that the film would be released that week, on May 3.
Reception.
"Variety" gave the film a lukewarm review. They lauded Cabanne's direction as well as the script and plot, especially the mob scenes. However, they felt the movie was too slow, stating "... the film lags until the final reel." "The Saturday Evening Post" gave the film a positive review, saying "It gives you a mental Turkish bath, then rubs your conscience down with a rough towel. It's a great picture to see. Full of very beautiful scenes —– interspersed with some that have prongs in them." "Motion Picture News" gave the picture an overall favorable review, although they felt the epilogue in which all the resolutions are shown was too long. They particularly enjoyed the allegorical prologue, then projected into the main story: "Yet this knowledge furnished to the onlooker is by no means a dampener to his interest. It is most attractive to watch the development of the main plot after seeing the same characters in the allegorical prologue. It is fascinating to see the similarity of the abstract and the specific, as conceived by the authors and to note the truth of both versions of the themes." "Motography" gave the film a positive review, being particularly impressed with the cinematography. "Moving Picture World" also gave the film a positive review, enjoying the symbolism employed by the allegory, although they did voice displeasure in the decision to have Evil as a real person, instead of simply a presence. They praised the teamwork of Woods and Cabanne, and gave good reviews to the entire cast, highlighting the work of Edeson and Gray.
Notes.
At least one source, "Picture-Play Weekly", had notes different character names. They have John Marxham instead of Nathaniel Crosby; Alma Ward instead of Ruth Farwell; Robert Thornley instead of Sampson Rhodes; and Tom Carrol instead of David Lee.

Don't Leave...

Don't Leave... () is a 1989 Soviet two-part television children's musical film directed by Leonid Nechayev, based on the play of the same name by Georgy Polonsky, which in turn is loosely based on the 1854 fairy tale of William Thackeray "The Rose and the Ring".
Plot.
The action takes place in the fairy-tale kingdom of Abidonia. Sixteen years ago King Henry II and Queen Emma, who ruled there, perished, and since then King Theodore, a former cavalry colonel, a great connoisseur and lover of horses, and his wife Flora have been presiding over the throne. Essentially, the country is ruled by Chancellor Count Daville and his wife Ottilia, the queen's sister. Their efforts in the country suppress any dissent.
The daughter of the royal couple, Princess Albina, dreams of marrying a foreign prince and finally breaking out of the monotonous palace life, where her only company is the silent poet Patrick, who lost his parents as a child and was adopted by the queen. Patrick is in love with Albina and does not attempt to hide it, the girl does not take him seriously because of ignoble origins and dumbness. In turn, maid Marcella is in love with Patrick, but he is too preoccupied with his feelings for Albina.
Penapia, Crown Prince of the neighboring kingdom of Penagonia arrives to Abidonia. It is obvious to everyone that the purpose of the visit is matchmaking. But the prince is followed by a string of failures: on his way to Abidonia, his motorcade falls into a predatory ambush, the guards surrender or run away, and the prince nearly dies. He is rescued by the wandering puppeteers Jacques and Martha.
Jacques' father, Jean-Jacques Freckles, a friend of Henry II, the late King of Abidonia, under the rule of Theodore was exiled to the island of Tibia, where he died. Before expulsion Jean-Jacques managed to bury his props, and now Jacques and Martha dug up the chest with dolls belonging to Freckles.
Penapia persuades rescuers to take him to the court of the Abidonian monarch, promising to ask the king for artists permission to perform in the kingdom. Upon arrival in the capital, the company is immediately seized by the police. Prince Penapia succeeds in getting interrogated by the king, whom the prince tells of the stallion Milorde which was stolen by bandits (it was to be given to Theodora if the matchmaking was successful). The king, a lover of horses, recognizes Penapia and accepts him at court.
However, the king comes across a trunk from the cart of artists. Recognizing familiar dolls, which caricatured him and the chancellor, the king orders to cast the artists in the dungeon, and commands Marcella to covertly burn the props.
Patrick finds Marcella and they do not have the heart to burn the dolls. They carry the chest to Patrick's room and there they find a dried blue rose in it.
According to legend, the fragrance of the blue rose made anyone who breathed it speak the truth. Marcella puts the flower in a vase of water, in the hope that the rose will come to life.
Meanwhile, a dinner begins in the palace in honor of the guest from Penagonia. Marcella brings the blue rose to the hall - the long-dried flower has suddenly revived. Moreover, the old fairy tale comes true - no one who smells the rose's fragrance can lie.
Immediately strange things start to happen: Marcella confesses Patrick in love and rebukes Albina for callousness, Patrick is healed of dumbness, and King Theodore publicly admits that the Guards, led by Colonel Udilak, found the robbers who had stolen Milord, and took the magnificent horse that he now considers his property.
Colonel Udilak comes to the king with an unheard-of request: he asks to release artists from prison, so that they can amuse the Guards who are celebrating the finding of Milord. Chancellor Daville, the only one who was not affected by the rose (because of a terrible allergic rhinitis that attacked him that day) is rushing about trying to maintain the status quo. He tries to reason with Udilak, threatens him, but neither Udilak nor guardsmen are afraid of the threatening chancellor anymore and ignore his orders. In the city, an uprising begins.
Meanwhile, Theodore and Ottilia tell Queen Flora and Albina against their will that sixteen years ago King Henry II and Queen Emma were killed as a result of the conspiracy of Theodore, the Chancellor and Ottilia. Albina learns that Patrick is a prince, son of Henry and Emma. After learning the truth about the death of her sister and her husband, Queen Flora takes off her crown and leaves. Albina accuses the Chancellor and his accomplices that they tore Patrick away from her, immediately expressing the intention to marry her cousin. The Chancellor wants to stop the departing Albina, but the king stops him. Theodore, breathing in a magical fragrance, confesses that he does not want any power or honor, he regrets that he lost his family and dreams of a simple life.
Jacques, Martha, Patrick, Penapia, Marcella and Albina return to the palace. Finally, the chancellor discovers the reason for the veracity which overcame everyone in the palace - Marcella tells him about the rose. In the last attempt to return everything back the chancellor shoots at the flower, but hits Marcella instead. Realizing that the game is lost, the chancellor commits suicide.
It's clear to all that Marcella is mortally wounded. The prince sings her last song about hope, all present listen with tears in her eyes. Suddenly, Penapia's face expresses amazement: the rose on Marcella's breast gradually turns from blue to red.

The 2018 United States Senate special election in Mississippi took place on November 6, 2018, to elect a United States Senator from Mississippi. The election was held to fill the seat vacated by Senator Thad Cochran when he resigned from the Senate, effective April 1, 2018, due to health concerns. Republican governor Phil Bryant appointed Cindy Hyde-Smith to fill the vacancy created by Cochran's resignation. Hyde-Smith sought election to serve the balance of Cochran's term, which expired in January 2021.
On November 6, per Mississippi law, a nonpartisan top-two special general election took place on the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat currently held by Roger Wicker. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot.
Because no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two candidates, Cindy Hyde-Smith and Mike Espy, was held on November 27, 2018, in which Hyde-Smith defeated Espy. Despite her reasonable margin of victory, Hyde-Smith significantly under-performed the states's partisan lean, as well as the 20-point margin of victory of Roger Wicker in his senatorial election, held concurrently with the first round of the special election in which the combined GOP candidates won 58% to the combined Dem total of 42%. Espy's 46.4% vote share is the best Democratic performance in a Mississippi Senate election since 1982.
The victory made Hyde-Smith the first woman ever elected to the United States Congress from Mississippi.
Runoff.
During the run-off campaign, while appearing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson in Tupelo, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith said, "If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be in the front row." Hyde-Smith's comment immediately drew harsh criticism, given Mississippi's notorious history of lynchings of African-Americans. In response to the criticism, Hyde-Smith downplayed her comment as "an exaggerated expression of regard" and characterized the backlash as "ridiculous."
Hyde-Smith joined Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant at a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi on November 12, 2018, where she was asked repeatedly about her comment by reporters. In the footage, Hyde-Smith adamantly refused to provide any substantive answer to reporters' questions, responding on five occasions with variations of, "I put out a statement yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about it." When reporters redirected questions to Bryant, he defended Hyde-Smith's comment, and changed the subject to abortion, saying he was "confused about where the outrage is at about 20 million African American children that have been aborted."
On November 15, 2018, Hyde-Smith appeared in a video clip saying that it would be "a great idea" to make it more difficult for liberals to vote. Her campaign stated that Hyde-Smith was making an obvious joke, and the video was selectively edited. Both this and the "public hanging" video were released by Lamar White Jr., a Louisiana blogger and journalist. Attention was also drawn to photographs, posted on Facebook four years earlier, of Hyde-Smith and her husband visiting former Confederate President Jefferson Davis' home, now an historical site. The photos show her wearing a Confederate hat and posing with a rifle commonly used by Confederate soldiers.

Daniel Turner (artist)

Daniel Turner (born July 22, 1983, Portsmouth, Virginia) is an American artist based in New York City. His media include sculpture, photography, video and drawing.
Early life and work.
Daniel Turner studied painting and printmaking at Norfolk State University and received a B.F.A. from San Francisco Art Institute. Turner worked in construction and demolition before being employed as a security guard at The New Museum in New York City. He was hospitalized several times for psychosis resulting in an action titled, "Burning an Entire Body of Work" (2006) in which he burned all previous paintings to date. Turner now works primarily in sculpture often involving the creation or transformation of materials, objects and environments into architectural or ephemeral forms. His sculptures are often characterized by a specific response to site under a controlled set of processes. These elements are present in works where an entire waiting room is cast into a series of solid bars, a former psychiatric facility burnished to a darkened stain against a wall, or a cafeteria dissolved across the expanse of a floor. In 2017, Daniel Turner completed "EMP Step" a site responsive sculpture for the restaurant Eleven Madison Park, in New York City. The contents of the restaurant's kitchen were melted down and cast into a monolithic step that sits at the entrance of the restaurant.
Residencies and teaching.
Turner has participated in artist residencies including Hauser &amp; Wirth, Bruton, England, Le Confort Moderne, Poitiers, France, Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas, and The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, New York, NY. Turner served as a guest scholar at New York University, The Syracuse University School of Art, The Maryland Institute College of Art, The San Francisco Art Institute and The Old Dominion Fine art University.
Personal life.
Turner is married to fellow artist Rita Ackermann.

<doc id="56759748" url="?curid=56759748" title="Donegal batholith">
Donegal batholith

The Donegal batholith is a large granitic igneous intrusion of early Devonian age that outcrops in County Donegal in Ireland. It consists of at least eight separate plutons, the largest of which is the Main Donegal Granite. It was intruded at a late stage in the Caledonian orogeny about 400 million years ago (Ma).
Extent and geometry.
The Donegal batholith extends for about 75 km in a SW-NE direction from just west of the small town of Ardara to Fanad Head. The NW-SE extent is more difficult to determine as much of the Thorr and Fanad plutons lie offshore.
Formation.
The Donegal batholith was formed during the Early Devonian, towards the end of the Caledonian orogeny between about 418 and 397 Ma. It is interpreted to have been intruded along a major SW-NE trending sinistral shear zone. The space to allow the intrusion of such large volumes of granitic magma into the crust is thought to be a result of movement along the shear zone combined with the sinistral strike-slip reactivation of a major SSW-NNE trending fault, running approximately through the centres of the Ardara, Trawenagh Bay, Rosses and Thorr plutons.
The chemistry and timing of the granites does not suggest that they are subduction-related. Subduction is thought to have ceased by the end of the Silurian (~419 Ma) and there is no evidence of significant involvement of mid-ocean ridge basalt or asthenosphere sources for the granitic melts. Break-off of the subducting slab following the end of subduction would lead to the upwelling of hot asthenosphere, causing melting of the overlying lithosphere producing lamprophyric magmas, underplating and injecting into the crust. The granitic magmas may be a result of either partially melting the lamprophyric underplate or by differentiation from the lamprophyric magmas. Further upwelling would lead to an increase degree of melting within the crust, contributing to a decrease in the amount of mantle component in the granitic melts. This is consistent with an overall change from more basic to more acidic with time observed in the plutons and a reduction of Barium and Strontium.
Plutons.
The batholith is made of at least eight separate granitic plutons.
Main Donegal Granite.
This is the largest of the plutons, extending for 44 km and about 10 km across. Three main phases of intrusion are evident. The first phase is a fine-grained granodiorite, which was emplaced into the Dalradian country rock, followed by sheeted tonalites intruded into both the Dalradian and the granodiorite. These early phases were followed by the emplacement of a large volume of porphyritic monzogranites at a time when the granodiorite and tonalite had cooled sufficiently to fracture.
Trawenagh Bay.
This pluton lies at the southwestern end of the Main Donegal granite. Three distinct types of granite are recognised, an outer biotite monzogranite inside which there is a body of biotite-muscovite monzogranite and in the centre is an aplitic biotite-muscovite microgranite. The intrusion is interpreted to have the form of a laccolith. The main part of the pluton shows only weak evidence of deformation. Studies of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) have found evidence of consistent west-east linear fabrics, interpreted to result from westward flow of the magma into the Trawenagh Bay pluton from the Main Donegal granite.
Thorr.
The Thorr pluton is one of the largest bodies in the batholith, covering an area of about 800 km2, although its precise extent is unknown as a major part of it lies offshore.
Ardara.
The Ardara pluton has an almost circular outcrop apart from being elongated to towards the east. Most of the outer parts of the intrusion are made of a coarse-grained monzodiorite. Going into the centre of the pluton the next unit is a tonalite-granodiorite, with megacrysts. The central part is a coarse-grained granodiorite.
Rosses.
The roughly circular Rosses pluton also has a concentric plan with an outer unit of medium-grained granite. Inwards this is followed over most of the outcrop by a coarser-grained granite, although it is not present to the south. Occupying most of the centre of the intrusion is a finer-grained granite, locally with the development of a small body of muscovite-rich granite.
Barnesmore.
This pluton lies well to the south of other parts of the batholith and is not that well studied, partly due to a lack of exposure. Three main units have been identified, one of granodiorite and two of granite. The Barnesmore pluton is relatively enriched in Uranium and Thorium compared to other parts of the batholith. Locally the original biotite monzogranite is strongly altered to a rock with a syenite mineralogy, lacking in quartz, due to metasomatism. The intrusion has been dated as 397±7 Ma using Rb-Sr dating.
Fanad.
The Fanad pluton is made up of three separate bodies, with a significant part of its extent being offshore. The main rock types are quartz monzodiorite and granodiorite. The intrusion has been dated as 402±10 Ma using Rb-Sr dating.
Toories.
This pluton is only known from a few exposures of quartz monzodiorite and monzotonalite on islands off the Donegal coast and has been little studied. No radiometric dating has been carried out on this granite, although field relationships suggest that it postdates the Thorr pluton and was intruded before the Rosses pluton. It appears to have a similar internal structure to the Ardara pluton, suggesting it is another example of forceful intrusion.

Ecomom

Ecomom was a brand founded by Kimberly Pinkson in 2006, with a focus on environmentally safe and healthy products for mothers and their children. It consisted of the non-profit education arm, EcoMom Alliance, and an affiliated e-commerce startup company co-founded by Jenny Orser and Chris de Tournay Birkhan. Its head offices were originally located in San Francisco before moving to Santa Monica. After an acquisition by Jody Sherman, and disagreements in management style, Pinkson was forced out and the company and the headquarters moved to Las Vegas.
In 2011, the company's sales exceeded $1 million USD. However, due to several factors, including the suicide of Jody Sherman, and the company's low profit margins due to excessive discounting, Ecomom shut down in early 2013. Etailz Inc., formerly GreenCupboards, an e-commerce site specializing in environmentally friendly brands, acquired Ecomom in the same year. The website of Ecomom reopened in the early summer of 2013.
Reasons for failure.
Ecomom adopted a deep discounting policy which offered customers fifty-percent discount. As a result, Ecomom lost money every time it sold products because half the price was lower than the cost price. In addition, Ecomom did not limit these discounts, so repeat customers could take advantage of the 50% discount when shopping. Ecomom spent excessively on marketing its products, for example, the expenditure for search engine marketing was not proportional to the return of investment. Ecomom's management did not understand that the abuse of the offered discount would have a negative impact on the company when developing new audiences and markets.
In addition to the low profit margins, Ecomom faced issues with investors. Rather than source income from a professional venture capitalist, Sherman received money in small chunks from wealthy individuals. This allowed him to run the business largely independently. However, due to the relative small stake of these investors in the company, none of them had a strong incentive to get closely involved and make the company a success. This further hurt Ecomom's viability as a business.

Sweet Caress

Sweet Caress: The Many Lives of Amory Clay is a novel by William Boyd, published by Bloomsbury in 2015. A fictional autobiography supposedly written by a woman, Amory Clay, born in 1908, it includes extracts from her diary, written on a Hebridean island in 1977, with flashbacks from her career as a photographer in London, Scotland, France, Germany, the United States, Mexico and Vietnam. The book also includes more than 70 photographs, collected by Boyd, most of which are attributed to her.
Boyd describes it as a "whole life novel" in that it tells the story of the book's main character "from cradle to grave", a technique he also employed in "The New Confessions" (1987) and "Any Human Heart" (2002).
The book is dedicated to Boyd's wife, Susan.
Plot.
Amory Clay lives alone in a cottage on a Scottish island where, in 1977, she is writing a journal about her life and career. Born in 1908, she is the eldest of three children in a middle-class family in Sussex. She excels academically at boarding school and was encouraged by her teacher to go to Somerville College, Oxford, but performs badly in her exams after her father, traumatised by his military experiences in the First World War, tries to commit suicide and to kill her as well. Apprenticed to her uncle, she works as a society photographer in London but then seeks more excitement in Berlin, where she frequents the underworld and takes photographs that, when she exhibits them in England, are viewed as scandalous. An American magazine offers her a job and she moves to New York, where she has affairs with her American boss and with a French diplomat who is also a writer. Back in London, where she runs an office for the American magazine, she covers a demonstration by Oswald Mosley’s fascists, in which she is attacked and badly injured. After spending the early part of the Second World War in New York, she returns to Europe as a war photographer covering the D-Day landings and accompanies Allied Forces as they sweep through France and Germany. She meets and marries a British officer, Sholto Farr, who is also a Scottish lord, and – unexpectedly, as she had thought the injuries she had received from Mosley's supporters had made her infertile – gives birth to twin daughters. Like her own father, her husband is haunted by memories of war. He drinks heavily, gambles, and loses much of the family fortune, before dying of a heart attack. Living in reduced circumstances, Amory returns to photography, seeks excitement as a Vietnam War photographer, then travels to California to search for one of her daughters, who has joined a hippy colony and religious sect, and with whom she is eventually reconciled. Looking back on her life and career, and in increasingly poor health, the 69-year-old Amory contemplates taking her own life.
Publishing history and adaptations.
"Sweet Caress" was published by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and the United States in hardback in 2015 and in paperback in 2016. It was published in Canada by HarperCollins in 2015.
A French language edition, "Les vies multiples d’Amory Clay," translated by Isabelle Perrin, was published by Éditions du Seuil in October 2015. A German language version, "Die Fotografin: Die vielen Leben der Amory Clay", was published in Berlin in 2016 by Belletristik, in a translation by Patricia Klobusiczky and Ulrike Thiesmeyer.
An unabridged audiobook version, narrated by Jilly Bond and lasting 15 hours and 9 minutes, was released in the United Kingdom by Whole Story AudioBooks in September 2015 and in Australia by W F Howes in October 2015. An unabridged audiobook version, narrated by Susan Lyons and lasting 15 hours and 44 minutes, was released in the United States by Recorded Books in September 2015.
Abridged by Sara Davies and read by Barbara Flynn, "Sweet Caress" was serialised on BBC Radio 4's "Book at Bedtime" in 2015.
Reception.
Reviewing the book in "The Observer", Elizabeth Day said that it "blends history and fiction to fine effect... Amory’s fictional voice never wavers. She can be tricky, contradictory and impulsive, but this only serves to emphasise her realness. She emerges from this novel as a rounded, complex, infernally beguiling human being... [Boyd] delights in blending artifice with naturalism – the text is punctuated by photos supposedly taken by Amory and by the occasional portrait, sufficiently blurred to remain just anonymous enough. Even the title of the book is taken from an invented quote lifted from a hypothetical novel written by one of the fictional characters. But the cleverness never overwhelms the narrative. Sweet Caress is an audacious, sweeping, rich layer cake of a novel, at once a textual hall of mirrors and a brilliant tale of a life well lived".
"For William Boyd's war-photographer heroine, life is a series of accidents", according to Caroline Moore in her review of "Sweet Caress" for "The Spectator". "Boyd’s representation of a certain sort of female voice is pitch-perfect" she said and "[f]or those who appreciate a novel in which emotional life is sensed at the edges of what is said, this is a masterly portrait. And the final chapters, in which Amory tries, with typical courage, to take ultimate control of her life, and then finds further courage to recognise the limitations of control, are superbly written and desperately moving".
Justin Cartwright, also for "The Observer", said that "Sweet Caress is a compendious and intelligent work, made authentic by Boyd’s extensive use of real dispatches and evocative photographs and his familiarity with makes of camera".
Mary Hoffman, reviewing the book for "The Independent", described it as "an utterly compelling read and Boyd's best novel since Restless". She concluded: "The effect of Amory is that of an interesting woman with a life well-lived, who is not content to sit back and be beautiful as an adored wife or mistress. She grasps every opportunity with both hands, wherever it leads her. Not a bad epitaph, and a tribute to Boyd's skill that we miss her like a friend when we, and she, reach the end".
Trish Halpin, editor-in-chief of "Marie Claire", described Boyd's novel as "[r]iveting – I’m sure this will be my book of the year".
Geir Darge, for "The Student", called "Sweet Caress" "bold and enthralling, humorous and heart-breaking". He said: "The reader cannot help but live alongside Amory from the tragedies of her younger years to the pensive isolation of her later life. His latest novel is yet more proof that Boyd has a gift for creating a perfect novel".
Madeleine Keane, reviewing the book in the "Irish Independent", said: "One of the great strengths of Sweet Caress is Amory – a complex character who, though not always likeable, is frequently admirable, not least in her desire to lead an interesting life". She recalled that "Boyd once said how he tried 'to make fiction seem so real you forget it's fiction'" and said that, in her view, "He mostly succeeds". She concluded: "Amory's gay uncle Greville invents a game (the early sections are pure Mitford), in which people are described in four adjectives. Sweet Caress is, like most of this writer's impressive body of work, vivid, poignant, compulsive and entertaining".
Jon Michaud, writing in "The Washington Post", was more critical, saying that "for all its surface drama and intrigue, 'Sweet Caress' remains a resolutely bland book, and Amory Clay’s life story never amounts to more than a string of diverting anecdotes, like a series of stories polished over countless retellings at parties. Boyd’s decision to go for panoramic sweep rather than detailed close-up often results in an unsatisfying cursoriness... A running gag between Amory and her uncle is that everyone can be summed up in four adjectives. Applying that notion to 'Sweet Caress,' I’d say, breezy, overlong, superficial and disappointing".
Controversy.
In the chapter on Amory Clay's experiences as a war photographer in the Vietnam War, she meets British soldiers who are operating undercover as Australians. Boyd said in 2017 that although he believed that the Ministry of Defence still denied it, he thought that "it is pretty much established now that British forces were fighting in Vietnam, disguised in the late 60s early 70s".

Howard-Dickinson House

The Howard-Dickinson House was built in 1855 and is located at 501 South Main in Henderson, Texas. This house was the first brick home built in Rusk County, Texas and is in the Italianate architecture style. In 1968, the Howard-Dickinson House was presented a Texas Historical Medallion and was recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark.
James Logan Howard and Dave P. Howard, two brothers from Virginia, built the home and lived there for 50 years. Dave Howard, his wife Martha, their 9 children, and Dave’s bachelor brother Logan Howard lived in the house. At that time, the Howard brothers were well-known brick makers and carpenters in Henderson. They manufactured the bricks at the back of the house, and many of the houses still standing in Henderson were built from these
Sam Houston, the first president of the Republic of Texas, was a frequent visitor to the house. He was a cousin to Martha Howard. Houston’s campaign trunk is displayed in the house.
Mrs. Katie Dickinson purchased the home in 1905 and the Dickinson family lived there for about 50 years. During this time, they added the two-story wing located in the rear of the home. This section of the home was used in the 1930s as a boarding house for workers during the East Texas Oil Boom.
By the 1960s the house was in need of repair and was given by the then owner, businessman Homer Bryce, to the Rusk County Heritage Association, a group formed to save the house. In 1967, after much fund-raising and restoration work, the house was restored and opened to the public as a living museum and meeting place for special events. Ghost tours are also given in the home.

Sam Nunberg

Sam Nunberg (born June 21, 1981) is an American public affairs consultant based in Manhattan. He was a political advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In March 2018, Nunberg was subpoenaed by a grand jury for testimony and documents relating to the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.
Early life and education.
Nunberg was born to a Jewish family; his mother was a corporate attorney at Wachtell, Lipton and his father was a real estate attorney who worked with Trump attorney Gerald Schrager. He attended the Ramaz School an independent co-educational Modern Orthodox Jewish prep school in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He graduated with a BA in History, with a senior thesis titled "Re-Analyzing the Historiography of the Effects of Dollar Diplomacy", from McGill University in 2004, where he competed globally with the McGill Debating Union. He attended Touro Law Center on Long Island, New York, from 2007 to 2009, graduating in 2009, and was admitted to the New York state bar in 2013.
Career.
While volunteering for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, Nunberg met and was recruited by attorney Jay Sekulow to volunteer at the American Center for Law &amp; Justice in an attempt to stop the construction of the Park51 mosque. While volunteering there he met political operative Roger Stone, whom he has described as his mentor and "surrogate father".
Nunberg began working for Trump, as a political and public affairs consultant, in 2011, after Trump decided not to run for president in 2012. Nunberg assisted in the writing of Trump's 2011 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
In February 2014 Nunberg was fired by Trump after he arranged a BuzzFeed interview that ended up being highly critical of Trump; the headline was "36 Hours on The Fake Campaign Trail with Donald Trump." Nunberg was rehired in April 2014 and was Trump's first full time hire for the Donald Trump for President 2016 Campaign; he was let go in December for undisclosed reasons. In February 2015 he was once again rehired by Trump, as a communications adviser for the Trump campaign, but was let go, shortly thereafter, by then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
Nunberg was rehired for a fourth time by the campaign in April 2015; between then and the beginning of July he was paid $85,139 by the campaign. Nunberg, along with Stone, helped prepare Trump for the first Republican debate, on August 6, 2015. Nunberg left the campaign in August, 2015 after continued tensions with Lewandowski. In March 2016 Nunberg endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president, saying that Trump "does not have a coherent political ideology."
In July 2016 Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million, accusing Nunberg of violating a confidentiality agreement by leaking information to the "New York Post". In a legal response, Nunberg said that Trump might have illegally funneled corporate money into the campaign. Trump and Nunberg settled their legal dispute in August 2016.
March 2018 subpoena and media appearances.
On March 5, 2018, Nunberg spoke to multiple cable news outlets and newspaper reporters without the knowledge of his attorney. He said he had been subpoened by a grand jury to testify and provide documents relating to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, including all his email exchanges with Donald Trump, Roger Stone, and eight other people. He insisted he did not intend to comply with the subpoena, saying "Let him (Mueller) arrest me!" He also had in-person interviews with "CNN's" Jake Tapper and Erin Burnett and "MSNBC's" Katy Tur and Ari Melber. He later backtracked, saying that he would cooperate fully with the subpoena, while expressing frustration at the large amount of documentation requested. On March 9, 2018 Nunberg testified before a federal grand jury for more than six hours, saying it was his, "duty as an American, whether I like it or not."
Regarding the Mueller investigation, when asked whether he believed that the special counsel may have something on Trump, Nunberg said, "I think they may." He added: "I think that he may have done something during the election. But I don't know that for sure." He also said "I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act" and that: "Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me."
Regarding Trump's former foreign-policy advisor Carter Page, Nunberg said that he believed that Page did collude with the Russians."

Oleg Reabciuk

Oleg Reabciuk (born 16 January 1998) is a Moldovan professional footballer who plays for Greek club Olympiacos and the Moldova national team, as a left-back.
Club career.
Early career / Porto.
Born in Ialoveni, Moldova, Reabciuk migrated at the age of four to Rio Maior in the Santarém District of Portugal. At 11, he was spotted by Sporting CP while playing for a local team, but left a year later due to tiredness from the long journeys to Lisbon, and to concentrate on his education.
After becoming national champion with Rio Maior, Reabciuk was invited to train with C.F. Os Belenenses in June 2015, having impressed in a match against them. He then moved to FC Porto in a similar circumstance in July 2016, where he signed his first professional contract of four years in 2017.
On 26 November 2017, Reabciuk made his professional debut for FC Porto B in LigaPro, at home to Associação Académica de Coimbra. He played the first 67 minutes of the 2–1 defeat before being substituted for Musa Yahaya. The following 4 February, he scored a late winner as the team came from behind to beat neighbouring Leixões S.C. 2–1 also at the Estádio Dr. Jorge Sampaio. By 18 March, when he netted his fourth goal in ten appearances with one in a 3–0 home win over S.C. Covilhã, he was the team's top scorer for the season.
Paços de Ferreira.
On 13 July 2019, Reabciuk signed a four-year deal with F.C. Paços de Ferreira. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 24 August in a 1–1 draw at Boavista F.C. as a 75th-minute substitute for Renat Dadashov. On 18 October 2020, he scored his first top-flight goal to open a 2–1 home win over C.D. Santa Clara, his team's first of the season.
Olympiacos.
On 1 January 2021, Reabciuk completed a €2 million transfer to Superleague Greece outfit Olympiacos, signing a long-term deal until the summer of 2025. He made his debut five days later in a 4–0 win at Asteras Tripolis F.C. as an 85th-minute substitute for José Holebas, and ended the season as a league champion. On September 16, 2021, he scored his first goal for the club against Royal Antwerp in the Europa League in a 2-1 win, he scored the late winner in the 87th minute.
International career.
In November 2016, Reabciuk was called up for the Moldova national under-19 football team. At that time, he did not have proficiency in the Romanian language, or a Moldovan passport.
Reabciuk was called up by Moldova national football team manager Alexandru Spiridon in March 2018, for a friendly against the Ivory Coast, while having just ten senior appearances for Porto B to his name.

Awaji dialect

The , also called , is a dialect of Japanese spoken on Awaji Island (which comprises the cities of Sumoto, Minamiawaji, and Awaji) in the southern part of Hyōgo Prefecture. According to the introduction of "Comprehensive Study of the Kinki Region," a publication of the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL), titled "Subgroupings of the Kinki Dialects", the Awaji Dialect straddles the Central (typified by the pronunciation of the mora /se/ as [ɕe], use of the copula "=ja", a distinction between the perfect and progressive aspects, and a migration of the monograde verb classes to the quadrigrade class) and Western Kansai dialect regions. The dialect shares many features with the dialects of the cities of Osaka, Kobe, and Wakayama, which is shares the Osaka Bay with, as well as with that of Tokushima Prefecture, which exercised control (as Awa Province) over Awaji Island during the feudal period. On the other hand, it bears little resemblance to the Banshū dialect, spoken right across the Akashi Strait from the island.
Classification.
Tasuaki Negita in "A Study of the Awaji Dialect" (1986, ) divides the Awaji dialect into Northern, Central, and Southern varieties, grouping the Northern Awaji dialect with that of the area of the former Kawachi and Yamato Provinces, Central Awaji with that of Izumi Province and Wakayama City, and Southern Awaji with that of Tokushima City.
Yamamoto Toshiharu and Yuriko Iino in "The Dialects of Hyōgo: Their Distribution and Classification" (published in The Bulletin of Mukogawa Women's University, Vol. 10, 1962) instead divide the dialect into Northern Awaji, Sumoto, and Southern Awaji, and further subdivide Northern Awaji into Eastern and Northern sub-varieties.
Intonation and pitch accent.
The entire island uses a Keihan type (wordtone and accent) pitch accent system. Especially among the elderly and people living in remote areas, the traditional Keihan system (which has disappeared in Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and most of the rest of the Kansai Region) is still to be found.
 noted in "Three Major Dialects of the Inland Sea Region" (part of "Japanese Dialects of the Shōwa Period") that the vicinity of the former (now part of the Hokudan-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) had a H-L-H type intonation (e.g., "dokomade it-temo" ("wherever go.") would be pronounced "dókòmádè ìttémò"). Eiichi Murauchi tells us that one Mrs. Koi, an elderly women from (now part of the Higashiura-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) had "kíkìbín" ("heel") and "kátàkúmà" ("piggyback ride") for standard Japanese "kibisu" and "kataguruma", respectively, and Yoshiyuki Hattori observed in 1965 an elderly woman from the Kusumoto area (now also part of Higashiura-chō Tsuna-gun) who had "tsúbàkúrò" ("swallow") for standard "tsubame". In general, north of (part of the Ichinomiya-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City) and (part of Tsuna-chō Tsuna-gun area of Awaji City), the prosodic system includes examples not only like these, which can be found throughout the country, but a somewhat different system, found nowhere else in Hyōgo Prefecture.
Pronunciation.
Awaji dialect speakers, like many other speakers of rural Kansai dialects, exhibit alternations between the phonemes /d/, /z/, and /r/, between /m/ and /b/, and /b/ and /w/. Other features shared in common with such dialects include diphthong assimilation, excrescence at a compound boundary, alternations between voiced and voiceless consonants, and various euphonic changes.
To give an example of variant forms, the Sumoto variety has "igok-" ("move"), "sabuk-" ("cold"), "osshe-" ("teach"), "kaaraa" ("roof tile"), and "ebesu" ("provincial") for standard "ugok-", "samuk-", "oshie-", "kawara", and "ebisu", respectively.
In the of Sumoto, however, a very distinctive variety of Awaji dialect, termed Yura-ben (meaning "Yura dialect"), is spoken, characterized by rapid speech and frequent sound assimilations and omissions, making it very difficult to understand (in the rest of island, only the assimilation of the diphthong /ai/ to /æː/ is common).
According to the "Linguistic Atlas of Japan" (a publication of NINJAL's Regional Linguistics Laboratory), elderly people in some sections of the former towns of Midori and Nandan (now both part of Minamiawaji City) still preserved the distinction between /kw/ and /k/ and /gw/ and /g/, lost in most of the rest of the country. In addition, the map indicates a preservation of the medieval pronunciation of the mora /se/ as [ɕe] in some parts of Nandan's .
In most Kansai dialects, when a mora other than the first of a word consisting of a consonant and a high vowel is followed immediately by a vowel or semivowel (whether word-internally or -externally), the consonant changes to one of the moraic phonemes /Q/ or /N/, the high vowel is deleted, and the vowel or semivowel becomes /j/; the resulting sequence of /QCj/ or /NCj/ may then be subject to further changes due to the regular process of palatalization common to all Japanese dialects. This process is exemplified by the famous realization "sunmyos=shat-tara assha=de nisshakas=shuki=ni" ("If you want to get to Sumiyoshi, catch the Nishi-Akashi-bound [train] at Ashiya," lit. "Sumiyoshi= Ashiya= Nishi-Akashi==") for underlying *"sumiyoshi=yat-tara ashiya=de nishiakashi=yuki=ni". In the Awaji dialect, however, this change can also affect the first mora of a word, resulting in forms like "ssar-" ("sit") and "ssho" ("salt") for standard "suwar-" and "shio", respectively, and thus making the dialect a rare example of a Japanese variety that allows initial geminates.
Grammar.
Awaji dialect has the following features:
Conjugation.
The "-ba" of the provisional form fuses with the base of the verb; for example, "kak-ya" ("write.") for standard "kake-ba". Also, the r-row quadrigrade nonpast ending "-r-u" and the monograde nonpast ending "-ru" change to either /Q/ or /N/ when followed by some uninflected words and a few special verbs, giving forms like "hashiz=zo" ("run-=") and "a-n=no=ka" ("exist.==") for standard "hashir-u=zo" ("run.=") and "ar-u=no=ka".
Speakers of the Awaji dialect are often lambasted for not using respectful language. It has been said of the regional character of Sumoto, that since social status and socioeconomic levels do not vary much, respectful language is scarce, that people from Awaji are often heard to speak unreservedly to each other in the interest of fostering frankness among intimates, and that the use of such language may come off as cold or distant. But the Awaji dialect certainly does not lack respectful forms intrinsically. Although the dialect has its own rich inventory of such expressions, due to the diffusion of respectful forms from Standard Japanese on the island, they are in the process of disappearing.
Other types of respectful language.
In polite language, the forms "a-z=ze" ("exist.=") and "a-k=kana" ("exist.=") are preferred to "a-z=zo" and "a-k=ka" ("exist.=") for standard "ar-u=yo" and "ar-u=ka", respectively. Also, the choice of the honorific prefix "go=" or "o=" is governed by the same rules as in the standard language, so "kigen=ya e-e=ka" ("Are [you] in a good mood?", lit. "mood= good.=") becomes "go=kigen=ya o=yoroshi-i=kana" (lit. "=mood= =good-="), for standard "kigen=wa i-i=ka" and "go=kigen=wa o=yoroshi-i=kana", respectively.
Of course, when in Standard Japanese a speaker would attach the suffix "-san" to a person's name, in Awaji dialect the suffix "-han" is used instead, just as in the Osaka dialect.
Vocabulary.
Influence from surroundings.
The variations of the island's regions are such that it is difficult to talk of a single, unified Awaji dialect. The lineages of Kobe and Osaka, Kii, Awa are mixed together in the vocabulary and grammar of the dialect. To take the standard "mi-na-i" ("see.") as an example, the Kobe/Osaka forms "mii-hen" and "mi-yahen" are found in the vicinity of the former Tsuna District and in the and sections of Sumoto City, the Kii forms "mi-n" and "mi-yan" are found in Sumoto's Yura and Nada neighborhoods, the neighborhood of the Nandan-chō Mihara-gun section of Minamiawaji City, and on Nushima, and the Awa form "mi-yasen" (all "see.") is found in the rest of the former Mihara District and within the original boundaries of the City of Sumoto, and there are even areas of Sumoto and southern Goshiki where the Kobe/Osaka and Awa forms are found in free variation. One place where the vocabulary is relatively average or even meager is the island's largest city, Sumoto, in the so-called "Sumoto Dialect" spoken within the old boundaries of the city. Conversely, it is within the very same city, in the Yura neighborhood, where what may be the island's most characteristic variety, the aforementioned Yura Dialect, is spoken.
In most Kansai dialects, the word "aho" ("idiot") is seen for standard "baka", and the Awaji dialect is no exception, but in Hokudan one also find "chage" (realized [tɕaŋe]) with the same meaning. The form "kichanak-" ("dirty") is common for standard "kitanak-", and particularly in northern region the form "chanak-" or the alternative word "yosowashik-" are also found.　The dialects of Kyoto/Osaka/Kobe, Wakayama, and Okayama have retained the word "senchi" ("restroom"), replaced in the standard language by "benjo", and in Awaji this has become "sencha"; the dialects of Sumoto's Yura and Nada sections also have the forms "hako" and "nbako".
Throughout Hokudan and in parts of Higashiura expressions reminiscent of those of the , such as "yo-o ki-ta=noo ware" ("welcome," lit. "good. come.= you") and "sonna koto s-uk=ka re" ("don't do that," lit. "that sort of thing do.= you") for standard "yok-u ki-ta=nee, omae=wa" (lit. "good. come.=, you=") and "sonna koto s-uru=kai, omae=wa" ("that sort of thing do.=, you="), respectively, can be seen.
The reason that Awaji shares forms and vocabulary with such geographically distant regions as Settsu, Izumi, and Kawachi is that from ancient times a bilateral trade of goods and culture flourished, and the activities of the Nojima and Mihara fisherman (groups that once inhabited the island and that are mentioned in the earliest chronicles of Japan), who moved between Naniwa and Yamato, is noted in the historical record. As for the connection to Awa, the island was during the Edo Period ruled over by the Tokushima Domain.
A dialect at the center of the Inland Sea.
As the Seto Inland Sea has from time immemorial served to connect Kyushu and the Kinai by sea, it has played a very important role in Japanese history. New words from the capital area leaving Honshu for the West first had to stop over in Awaji. Through absorbing all of this new vocabulary so quickly, the island, along with others in its vicinity such as Shōdo and and in the Naruto Strait, constituted a remarkable dialect sprachbund (an area where dialects share linguistic features, in this case vocabulary, because of extensive contact despite not necessarily being closely related). For standard "takenoko-gasa" (a type of conical hat made from weaving together bamboo sheaths, lit. "bamboo shoot.hat"), we find words such as "taiko-gasa" and "taiko-bachi" disseminated throughout the Seto, and the word "chinchiro" ("pinecone") for standard "matsukasa", pervasive in mainland Kansai, has also spread to Awaji and the islands in the open sea around the Naruto.
Under the influence of this state of affairs, Awaji Island has had a strong tendency to be isolated on the periphery. Examples of vocabulary items found only on the island are "hotoke=no uma" ("praying mantis," lit. "buddha. horse"), for standard "kamakiri" ("praying mantis"), "hi=ater-i ame" ("sunshower," lit. "sun=expose. rain") for standard "hi=der-i ame" (lit. "sun=shine. rain"), and "hidari=ete" ("left-handed," lit. "left=forte") for standard "hidari=kik-i" (lit. "left=effective."). In addition to these Awaji-specific forms, the dialect also has forms found in other places, such as "iari" ("ant") for standard "ari", also found in Kyushu, and even as new words develop or are taken in from elsewhere, there is a still a tendency to preserve the old forms.

Charles Anderson (vocalist)

Charles Anderson (1883 – after 1937) was an American vaudeville entertainer, singer and female impersonator, known as a pioneer performer of blues songs.
Biography.
Born in either Snow Hill or Birmingham, Alabama, Anderson was an active vaudeville performer by 1909, when he played in Memphis, Tennessee. He shared bills with Bessie Smith on several occasions, and by summer 1913 was known for his comedy and his performances of blues songs and "lullaby yodels", called by one reviewer "the Male Mockingbird". Anderson regularly performed as a female impersonator, in costume as an archetypal "mammy", and performed songs including "Baby Seals Blues" and W. C. Handy's "Saint Louis Blues". Ethel Waters, long regarded as the first performer of the latter song, stated that she had first heard it sung by Anderson in Baltimore in 1917. He also toured in Ontario, Michigan, and elsewhere.
In 1923, Anderson recorded Seals' blues for Okeh Records, as "Sing 'Em Blues", with piano accompaniment by Eddie Heywood Sr.. Blues scholars Lynn Abbott and Doug Seroff commented on the performance: "Capturing the full range of Anderson's folk-operatic tenor voice in a remarkable rendition of the first published vocal blues song, this record survives to demonstrate an unabashedly comical resolution of "high" and "low" art, a positive realization of "colored folks opera." Anderson recorded a further six songs for Okeh in 1924, and at his final recording session in 1928 recorded "Saint Louis Blues" as well as "I Got Those Crying Yodelin' Blues."
Although a favorite with black vaudeville audiences at the time, Anderson has tended to be dismissed as a curiosity by later critics because of his high voice and clear diction, which Abbott and Seroff say "conflict with modern tastes and stereotypes."
Anderson is thought to have died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after 1937.

Lil Tracy

 
Jazz Ishmael Butler (born October 3, 1995), professionally known as Lil Tracy, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He was also known under the name Yung Bruh during the beginning of his career. Tracy is best known for his collaborations with the late rapper Lil Peep, specifically "Awful Things" which peaked at 79 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and for being a prominent member of the "SoundCloud rap" and underground rap scene.
Early life.
Jazz Butler was born on October 3, 1995 in Virginia Beach, Virginia to Ishmael Butler of Digable Planets and Shabazz Palaces and Cheryl Gamble, better known professionally as "Coko" from SWV. Talking about growing up in Virginia Beach, Butler said "it sucked but I love it" and said he grew up listening to emo music and southern hip-hop artists who inspired him to make music. Butler's parents split up when he was young and he would bounce between his mother and father's homes. Butler went to high school in Seattle, Washington at Garfield High School, and chose to be homeless at age 17.
Career.
Butler started to make music when he was 15 before moving to Los Angeles, California at 18 (without alerting his parents) to focus more on his music career and due to being homeless. Butler originally started rapping under the name "Yung Bruh", releasing several mixtapes under the Thraxxhouse collective. Some members of Thraxxhouse, including Tracy eventually started their own group, the collective GothBoiClique. Through the group, Butler met New York rapper Lil Peep, the two quickly collaborated on the song "White Tee" from Peep's "Crybaby" mixtape which gathered attention through the hip-hop underground. He also released a single "Overdose" which sprouted his career even bigger.
In mid-2016, changed his stage name from Yung Bruh to Lil Tracy due to discovering that there was already another artist using the "Yung Bruh" moniker. Under his new name he released his long-awaited mixtape "Tracy's Manga" on February 1, 2017. Butler went on to release "XOXO" two months later on April 3. Butler featured on the single "Awful Things" from Lil Peep's "Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1" in August 2017. The single peaked at number 79 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
Butler released "Life of a Popstar" on July 31, 2017.

Siegfried Ruff

Siegfried Ruff (19 February 1907 – 22 April 1989) was a German physician who served as director of the Aviation Medicine Department at the German Experimental Institute for Aviation.
Following World War II, Ruff was hired by the U.S. Army Air Forces to work at a United States military hospital in Heidelberg conducting experiments on human exposure to high altitudes. He was later indicted on various war crimes allegedly committed during his time as a researcher at the Institute for Aviation. Specifically, it was alleged he had overseen experiments that had resulted in the deaths of 80 Dachau concentration camp inmates. While Ruff acknowledged human experimentation had occurred, he stated it had occurred according to the law and denied it had resulted in any deaths. Ruff was acquitted of all charges against him during the Doctors' Trial. Nevertheless, in 1961 the International Academy of Aviation and Space Medicine chose to relocate its annual conference from West Germany over objections at Ruff's participation.
Ruff enjoyed a distinguished medical career in postwar Germany.

Hell-On

Hell-On is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Neko Case, released on June 1, 2018, on record label "Anti-". Case recorded the album largely in Stockholm, co-producing with Björn Yttling of Peter Bjorn and John.
Overview.
"Hell-On" was recorded during a tumultuous period in Case's life. While already dealing with serious problems caused by obsessed stalkers, her farmhouse residence in Vermont was destroyed by fire while she was away in Sweden working on the album, leaving her homeless. The recording of the album in Sweden allowed her to focus her energy on something positive and not dwell on these problems back home.
Case promoted the album by touring with Ray Lamontagne.
Critical reception.
"Hell-On" received universal acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85 based on 22 reviews.
In the review for AllMusic, critic Mark Deming praised the album; "With "Hell-On", Case has once again given herself an ideal showcase for her talents as a vocalist, songwriter, and producer; it's lush but intimate, and one of the strongest and most satisfying records she's delivered to date. Which, given her catalog, says a great deal."
Cover art.
Fans and critics have speculated that the fire in the album's cover art represents the fire that destroyed Case's Vermont home, but she has said it's actually completely coincidental. Inspired by the popular HBO series "Game of Thrones", she wanted to craft a family sigil. "I decided that my background was so trashy that my family crest would probably have a cigarette butt on it. But I was also obsessed with fake Hollywood cigarettes, so I thought it would be funny to make a costume out of what looked like burning cigarettes", she said of the cover art.

A Storm in a Teacup (Lu Xun)

Storm in a Teacup () is a short story by Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature. Originally published in September 1920 in the journal "New Youth" (新青年), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, "A Call to Arms" (吶喊). A Chinese boatman hears news of the abortive Manchu Restoration of July 1917 and fears that he will be executed as he had abandoned the queue after the fall of the Qing dynasty. At the same time his neighbour, who has kept his, exults. 
Background.
 In 1644, after the conquest of China by the Manchurian Qing dynasty, Han Chinese males were forced on pain of execution to adopt the queue, a Manchurian hairstyle consisting of shaving the forehead and wearing the rest of one's hair in a long plait. On the other hand, during the Taiping Rebellion, the revolutionaries would execute anyone who wore the queue as a presumed Qing loyalist. After the last emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912, the Republic of China was established and the queue was widely abandoned. In July 1917 the Qing loyalist Zhang Xun attempted to restore Puyi to the throne, but the revolt collapsed in a fortnight. Given the primitive communications infrastructure in China, this news took longer to spread to rural and remote areas.
Synopsis.
The boatman Sevenpounder (七斤) comes back to his village one night, bringing the news to his family that "the Emperor has returned to the Dragon Throne". He worries, as people in town had shaved off his queue during the revolution. Meanwhile, the innkeeper Zhao arrives. Zhao is renowned as the greatest scholar for ten miles round, as he reads the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". Zhao had only coiled up his queue, and has now let it down. Mrs Sevenpounder notices that he is wearing his special gown which he only does when an enemy has met with misfortune. Zhao bears Sevenpounder a grudge, and taunts him that he will be now be executed. Trusting in Zhao's scholarship, Mrs Sevenpounder gives up all hope and curses her husband for having shaven off his queue. Another neighbour remembers that Mrs Sevenpounder did not object when her husband stopped growing his queue, and an argument breaks out. 
A fortnight later, Mrs Sevenpounder notices that Mr Zhao has coiled up his queue again, and is not wearing his gown. The Sevenpounders relax, as it seems the emperor is not coming back after all. They begin binding their daughter's feet.

Oriental Orthodoxy in Guatemala

Oriental Orthodoxy in Guatemala refers to adherents of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in Guatemala. Most of the Oriental Orthodox Christians in Guatemala are ethnic Maya, who are under ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.
History.
Emergence of Oriental Orthodoxy in Guatemala was closely related to the process of canonical revival within particular Christian communities. By 2012, first contacts were initiated between the "Renewed Ecumenical Catholic Church of Guatemala" ("", ICERGUA) and representatives of Syriac Orthodox Church in North America, and within a year full communion was achieved. Leaders of ICERGUA accepted theological positions of Oriental Orthodox Christianity, and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Syriac Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Zakka I Iwas of Antioch. Conversion process was particularly successful among indigenous Maya in Guatemala.
This revival movement was led by Eduardo Aguirre-Oestmann, a former priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala. In 2003, Aguirre formed as a charismatic independent catholic church. In 2006, Cardinal Rodolfo Quezada Toruño, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Guatemala, excommunicated Aguirre and adherents of his group. They were excommunicated for schism, and Aguirre also for distancing himself "from the communion and the norms of his priesthood" by founding the "" in 2003. In 2007, Aguirre was consecrated as bishop of by a bishop of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church at the parish church in San Juan Comalapa. was a member of the Worldwide Communion of Catholic Apostolic Churches.
When was collectively received into Syriac Orthodox Church in 2012-2013, it was reorganized as the "Central American Archdiocese of the Syriac Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch" ("", ICASOAC). As of 2015, has not published membership figures but includes a 2009 estimate of membership on its website, which gives figures between 50,000 and 350,000. The Syriac Orthodox Church has announced that membership may be as high as 800,000.

Birth of a Family

Birth of a Family is a 2017 First Nations Canadian documentary directed by Tasha Hubbard and co-written by Hubbard and Betty Ann Adams. It follows three sisters and a brother, adopted as infants into separate families across North America, who meet together for the first time.
Summary.
The reunion emerged from decades of searching by Betty Ann Adams, the eldest of the family. Removed from their young Dene mother's care as part of Canada's infamous Sixties Scoop, Betty Ann, Esther, Rosalie and Ben were four of the 20,000 Indigenous children taken from their families between 1955 and 1985, to be either adopted into white families or to live in foster care. The documentary follows the siblings as they reunite in Banff, Alberta. As the four siblings piece together their shared history, their connection deepens, bringing laughter with it, and their family begins to take shape.
Filming process.
In 2014, Betty Ann Adam, a reporter at "The StarPhoenix", approached Hubbard about documenting her planned reunion and her intentions to direct the project.
Hubbard pitched the idea to the National Film Board (NFB) and the response was immediately supportive. However, the NFB made it a condition that Hubbard be director. Adam agreed in order to be more emotionally and physically present for the upcoming reunion. In an article for "The StarPhoenix", she emphasised the importance of having a director who had a similar lived experience of forced removal and adoption into a non-Indigenous family during the Sixties Scoop. Adam said, "It was perfect to have a director who had that same experience in her lived experience. We knew that would inform her approach toward the story, that she would understand certain things about what we were going through." This responsibility for holding space and minimal interference was central to the filming.
Despite the circumstances of the reunion taking place in a small cabin and it being a two-camera shoot, Adam says Hubbard was able to shoot the film without distracting the family from the connections they were there to make. "For us, things probably went as smoothly as they could. I think that's because she was taking care of things behind the scenes so they didn't interfere with our experience," Adam says.
Reception.
Reception of the documentary has been positive. It has featured in many festivals including the 2017 Talking Stick Festival, Edmonton International Film Festival, and the Toronto International Film Festival.
Patrick Mullen of "Point of View" reviews the film as "relevatory" and "a family reunion doc like you've never seen." Gateway Online calls this film a "triumph," writing in their review, ""Birth of a Family" reminds viewers of a painful past that many First Nations peoples had and continue to trudge through." Canada's documentary films festival described the film as a "raw emotion, a heart-wrenching combination of pain and joy, shown by the siblings throughout the film is as moving as anything I have seen on film. Their willingness to lay bare their experiences and feelings is inspiring, and while their story is devastating to watch it acts as a reminder of the resilience of the First Nations people who, against all odds and despite every effort to destroy them, continue to persevere."

Marcus Gavius Squilla Gallicanus

Marcus Gavius Squilla Gallicanus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. He was suffect consul in 150 AD with Sextus Carminius Vetus as his colleague. He was also proconsular governor of Asia in 164/165.
The origins of his family lie in Verona; an inscription mentioning one M. Gavius M.f. Pob. Squillianus has been recovered from there. Gallicanus was the son of Marcus Gavius Squilla Gallicanus, consul in 127; his brother was Marcus Gavius Orfitus, ordinary consul in 165. 
Gallicanus is known to have had at least two children. His son was Marcus Gavius Cornelius Cethegus, consul in 170; who was his "legatus" or assistant while proconsular governor of Asia. Gallicanus also had a daughter, Cornelia Cethegilla. Olli Salomies, in his monograph on the naming practices of the Early Roman Empire, records a number of experts who thought Cethegus and his sister were not natural, but adopted children of Gallicanus. After discussing the evidence, Salomies admits that he prefers the explanation that both "were Squilla Gallicanus' adoptive, not natural children."
That he was one of the witnesses to the "Tabula Banasitana" () shows Gallicanus was still alive 6 July 177. His life after that point is a blank.

Leanne Betasamosake Simpson also praised Belcourt's book, choosing it as her favorite book of 2017. In Simpson's words, "Belcourt is a sovereign genius and "This Wound is a World" redefines poetics as a refusal of colonial erasure, a radical celebration of Indigenous life and our beautiful, intimate rebellion." Lisa Tatonetti also praises the book, calling it a "powerful meditation on the intersections of violence, love, and the body."
"NDN Coping Mechanisms", Belcourt’s second book, was well received, being included in the library Journal’s list of Best Books 2019, the Writers Trust of Canada Best Books of 2019 and CBC Books Top Canadian Poetry Book of 2019. It was shortlisted for the 2020 ReLit Award for poetry.

Since 2008, Bennett has shown his work both nationally and internationally in over 75 exhibitions, notably "Beat Nation: Art, Hip Hop and Aboriginal Culture", an exhibition co-curated by Kathleen Ritter and Tania Willard that toured nationally in Canada from 2012–2014.
Education.
Bennett earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree at Grenfell Campus in Corner Brook, Newfoundland in 2008. He then went on to receive a Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) Degree at the University of British Columbia Okanagan in Kelowna, British Columbia in 2016. The focus of Bennett's MFA was to "re-imagin[e] the traditional art forms of the Beothuk and Mi’kmaq into a contemporary art discourse." Bennett was also a participant at the "Earthline Tattoo Training Residency" in 2016.
Themes.
Bennett's work tends towards interactive and multi-sensory as he incorporates multiple forms of media into his work to create immersive environments for the viewer. These interactive works incorporate a broad range of materials. Main sources of inspiration come from his interactions with Mi'kmaq and Beothuk porcupine quill designs, baskets, beadwork, clothing, and petroglyphs. Bennett's work engages with themes of land, language, family history, and colonial misinterpretations of Indigenous history and stereotypes in Canada. 
Bennett's artwork often references urban First Nations youth and culture. jilaqami’g no’shoe, created in 2009, is a skateboard carved into a snowshoe, referencing Indigenous skater culture and traditional practices. 
In another notable work, "Turning Tables" (2010), shown in the touring exhibition "Beat Nation: Art, Hip Hop and Aboriginal Culture," is a handcrafted mixing table made out of various woods. The record needle plays the sound of the tree's rights. In this work Bennett asserts the continuation of Traditional Knowledge in a digital era. 
Bennett's focus within his MFA looked at Mi’kmaq and Beothuk visual culture of Ktaqamkuk, which drew inspiration from the drawings of Shanawdithit, the last known living member of the Beothuk peoples.
He also participates in a collaboration with Amy Malbeuf under the moniker, Neon Kokhom, which is meant to "poke fun at indigenous stereotyping and its role in Canada's lucrative souvenir industry". This collaboration uses humour to address Indigenous misrepresentation
Career.
Earthline Tattoo.
After completing a tattoo apprenticeship with Nlaka'pamux artist Dion Kaszas, Bennet, Métis visual artist Amy Malbeuf and Kaszas co-founded an Indigenous tattoo collective and residency called Earthline Tattoo, which focuses on the resurgence of Indigenous cultural tattoo practices in Canada. In 2016, they conducted a training residency in which six Indigenous artists were invited to learn tattooing practices connected to Indigenous Traditions. The residency was supported, in part, by the Initiative for Indigenous Futures and hosted by the Faculty of Creative and Critical Studies, University of British Columbia Okanagan.

Jose P. Laurel Highway

Jose P. Laurel Highway, officially named as Manila–Batangas Road, is a , two-to-six lane, major highway running within the province of Batangas. The highway forms part of National Route 4 (N4) of the Philippine highway network. It is also known as Ayala Highway in Lipa and National Highway from Lipa to Batangas City.
The highway was named in the honor of Jose P. Laurel, a Batangas native who served as the president of the Second Philippine Republic.
Route description.
Jose P. Laurel Highway starts at the Santo Tomas Junction, a roundabout intersection with the Maharlika Highway and Governor Carpio Avenue. The Southern Tagalog Arterial Road mostly parallels the highway, and crosses each other at Lipa and Batangas City. It then enters Tanauan, Malvar, Lipa, where it diverts motorists around the poblacion as Ayala Highway, San Jose, and Batangas City, where it ends at the intersection with Palico–Balayan–Batangas Road and P. Burgos Street (Manila-Batangas Pier Road) in the poblacion.
History.
The highway's segment from Santo Tomas to Sabang, Lipa was part of Highway 19 that linked Santo Tomas and the then-municipality of Batangas via Rosario, notably during the American colonial era. A new alignment bypassing downtown Lipa, now known as Ayala Highway, was later built and was made part of the present-day highway.
