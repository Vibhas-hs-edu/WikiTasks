Occupational hazards of solar panel installation

This article is about the occupational hazards of solar panel installation.
The introduction and rapid expansion of solar technology has brought with it a number of occupational hazards for workers responsible for panel installation. Guidelines for safe solar panel installation exist, however the injuries related to panel installation are poorly quantified. 
There is concern for long term health effects acquired from prolonged ultraviolet radiation and from lifting heavy panels. The lack of data regarding these concerns makes increasing awareness for worker safety more challenging.
Exposures and health effects.
With regard to PV occupational safety, there are differing exposures depending on the stage of involvement in Solar energy production. This can be broken down into four stages. Exposures and their impacts on worker health intricately depend on the PV life-cycle stage, as well as depth and duration of system involvement by the individual. 
There is a wide variety of tasks required by the PV industry. These include scientists and engineers for material development, workers who pilot manufacturing facilities, miners and millers, factory manufacturers, power electronics, planners, developers, installation crews who work with electrical grids, transportation jobs, and recycling industry.
Raw Material Mining and Processing.
Hazards in this stage are mainly chemical in nature. They include crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon thin film, cadmium telluride thin film, copper indium selenide, copper indium gallium selenide, and gallium arsenide. These are highly toxic and flammable; hazardous exposures can come via chemical burns, explosions, and inhalation of gaseous fumes. Other routes can include hand-to-mouth contact or accidental ingestion. Most solar cells start as quartz, which is later refined into elemental silicon, which risks lung disease silicosis amongst miners.
Construction and Assembling.
During the manufacturing process, workers are exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals. Some of these chemicals such as telluride, cadmium telluride, gallium, and germanium are still under study. Other chemicals like chlorosilanes and hydrogen chloride are not only toxic but highly volatile and explosive when mixed with water.
In crystalline silicon solar cell production, workers may be exposed to hydrofluoric acid, or other acids and alkalis used for cleaning purposes, dopant gases and vapors (POCl3, B2H6) due to improper ventilation, or the flammable nature of silane and byproducts from silicon nitride deposition and fabrication of x-Si layers. Other fire-hazard risks arise from the use of extremely flammable SiH4 gas. Exposure to cadmium compounds can be carcinogenic, as Cd is considered a lung carcinogen and is regulated by OSHA. 
Installation/Operation.
Falls from heights are a significant risk for panel installers. Fatal falls from the installation phase have been reported from California and in France. Health effects associated with falls from roofs include, but are not limited to: skeletomuscular injuries, brain or spine injuries, concussions, lacerations, bruising, swelling, long-term disability, and/or mortality. 
Falls are more likely when roofing is old or damaged, or when panels are located close to edges, skylights, and vegetation. Other injury factors include lack of fall protection, proximity to overhead power lines, and unguarded skylights. It has been argued that incorporating PV technology into roof membranes, roof shingles, wall panels, or windows would reduce fall risk.
Installation effectively combines three high risk industries in one: roofing, carpentry, and electrical work. There is a risk of electrocution from installation or nearby power lines, as well as ergonomic risks from heavy loads or a lack of lifting equipment. Cold or heat stress and sun exposure can also occur.
There may also be a risk for infectious disease spread amongst PV employees. Solar farm construction requires soil-disruptive work, which can precipitate exposure to soil-dwelling organisms. Such cases have been documented in San Luis Obispo County, California between 2011-2014, where 44 workers came down with coccidioidomycosis while constructing solar power-generating facilities. Coccidioidomycosis (or "Valley Fever") is an infection caused by "Coccidioides" fungus spores and causes flu-like symptoms, as well as more serious complications such as meningitis, osteomyelitis, or cutaneous lesions. These can be fatal if not treated. In response to these isolated cases, the California Department of Public Health issued numerous recommendations, including improved worksite dust-control measures, equipping earth-moving equipment with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and respiratory protection for workers such as respirators with specialized particulate filters.
Occupational hazards may be exacerbated in settings with fewer worker protection policies in place, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. PV manufacturing has moved from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. to countries such as China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan, with nearly half of the world's photovoltaics made in China as of 2014.
End of Life Cycle and Recycling.
End-of-life recycling is also a source of hazardous chemical exposures for workers. Green recycling requires increased material handling and manual separation, which can demand two to three times more individual handing of materials. This can present a risk for strains, sprains, and punctures. 
PV end-of-life materials can include lead from electronic circuits, as well as brominated flame retardants (BFRs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) used in circuit boards and solar panel inverters. These are considered toxic and potential estrogen disrupters, as PBDEs bioaccumulate in fatty tissues.
Other hazards.
Many solar PV technologies use extremely toxic material that have unknown health and environmental consequences including new nano-materials and processes. There is limited data on specific air emissions and liquid or solid effluents from PV cells and processing.
Policy.
Research is currently underway exploring the possibility of replacing a number of the more hazardous chemicals workers are exposed to, such as cadmium and hydrofluoric acid, with less toxic chemicals.
Regarding policies related to solar panel installation, OSHA requires employers to implement and provide safety training for workers, including information on how to assess the worksite for potential hazards, safely perform required action such as heavy lifting, and what to do should an accident occur. This type of protection falls on the tip of on the hierarchy of controls as the least effective measure to ensure the safety of workers. 
In recent years the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched the Prevention through Design (PtD) initiative. This initiative strives to improve the health and safety of workers by taking a comprehensive approach to eliminate hazards and control risks earlier in the process.
In 2013, SEIA introduced the Solar Industry Environmental &amp; Social Responsibility Commitment, a voluntary set of guidelines for the solar industry. Companies can choose to sign and agree to adhere to general best practices, including those for worker safety.

2nd Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment

The 2nd Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment () was a cavalry regiment of the Imperial Russian Army.
The regiment was originally formed in 1783 as the Pavlograd Light Horse Regiment from the Dnepr and Yekaterinoslav Regiments of Pikemen, although it traced its seniority back to the establishment of both regiments in 1764. It became the Pavlograd Hussar Regiment in 1801, and fought in the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing itself at the Battle of Schöngrabern during the War of the Third Coalition. The regiment also fought at Austerlitz, Eylau, and Friedland, but served in a secondary theatre during the French invasion of Russia, although it fought in the Battle of Berezina in the latter. Subsequently, it took part in the Russian campaign in Europe, fighting at Leipzig, Craonne and Saint-Dizier. 
The regiment went on to fight in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, the November Uprising, the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Crimean War, and the January Uprising. 
Origins.
The Pavlograd Hussar Regiment was originally formed on 28 June 1783 from the Dnepr and Yekaterinoslav Regiments of Pikemen as the Pavlograd Light Horse Regiment, with six squadrons. Both of the Regiments of Pikemen had been established on 9 July 1764, which was celebrated as the regimental day. The Dnepr Regiment of Pikemen fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 from 1769, participating in the Storming of Bender on 16 September 1770 and the campaign of Pyotr Rumyantsev on the right bank of the Danube in 1771. The Yekaterinoslav Regiment of Pikemen was formed as the Donetsk Regiment of Pikemen and fought in the Russo-Turkish War. On 29 November 1796 it was named after its "chef", Brigadier Karl Bour, who was promoted to major general on 27 January 1797 and to lieutenant general on 6 September 1798, as a result of Paul I's reorganization of the regiments.
Napoleonic Wars.
The regiment fought in the Swiss expedition in 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition, with Army of Condé. On 26 September of that year the regiment fought in the repulse of the French attack on Constance. On 31 March 1801, the regiment was redesignated as the Pavlograd Hussar Regiment, with five squadrons, when Alexander I restored the previous naming of regiments.
During the 1805 War of the Third Coalition, the regiment formed part of Pyotr Bagration's column. On 27 September it reached Braunau, before fighting in the Battle of Lambach, the Battle of Amstetten, and the Battle of Schöngrabern during the retreat of Kutuzov from Krems to Znaim, distinguishing itself in the latter two. For its actions at Schöngrabern, the regiment was granted one white and nine green St. George standards on 13 June 1806. It fought on the right flank at the Battle of Austerlitz, covering Bagration's retreat.
Bour was replaced by Major General Yefim Chaplits on 23 July 1806, who was later promoted to lieutenant general on 31 October 1812. The Pavlograd Hussars subsequently fought in the Battle of Czarnowo, the Battle of Ostrołęka, the Battle of Golymin, the Battle of Eylau, the Battle of Heilsberg, and the Battle of Friedland during the 1806–1807 War of the Fourth Coalition, and in the advance into Galicia during the Austro-Polish War of 1809.
From 1810 to 1814 Colonel Spiridon Zhevakhov served as regimental commander; he was promoted to Major General on 15 September 1813.
At the beginning of the 1812 French invasion of Russia, the active squadrons of the regiment, numbering 1,116 men, were part of the Sergei Kamensky's corps in the Third Reserve Army of Observation, positioned in Volhynia. The reserve squadrons, formed in the Novgorod-Seversky Recruitment Depot, were planned to form part of the 14th Cavalry Division, but were instead used as replacements. The Pavlograd Hussars fought in the Battle of Kobryń and the Battle of Gorodechno , suffering casualties of eighteen men in the latter. At the end of September, the regiment's eight squadrons numbered 939 men. Subsequently, as part of Chaplits' detachment, the regiment distinguished itself in the Slonim affair and fought in the Battle of Berezina. On 27 December, when the Russian cavalry were reorganized, the Pavlograd Hussars became part of the 3rd Hussar Division, with six active and one reserve squadrons.
During the 1813 campaign in Saxony, the regiment fought in the Siege of Toruń, the Battle of Großbeeren, the Battle of Dennewitz, and the Battle of Leipzig. It fought at the Battle of Craonne and the Battle of Saint-Dizier during the 1814 Campaign in north-east France. On 19 November 1814, for their actions between 1812 and 1814, the Pavlograd Hussars were awarded shako badges for distinction.
1815 to 1918.
The Pavlograd Hussars fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, besieging Silistra and fighting in the Battle of Kulevicha. After marching through the Balkans it fought in the Battle of Sliven. The regiment participated in the suppression of the Polish November Uprising in 1831 at Minsk and Stanisławów. It gained two more active squadrons when a battalion of the abolished Pereyaslavl Horse Jaeger Regiment was merged into the regiment on 21 March 1833. On 1 April 1838, then-Tsesarevich Alexander Nikolayevich became ceremonial "chef" of the regiment, and it was accordingly redesignated as "His Imperial Highness the Heir Tsesarevich's Hussar Regiment".
To suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the regiment was sent to Hungary as part of the detachment of General Mikhail Cheodayev. It fought in the battles at Geremboli and Felsh-Zoltsa on 12 and 13 July, and participated in the occupation of Tokaj. During the Crimean War, the regiment fought in actions at Giurgiu and Slobozia in the initial occupation of the Danubian Principalities. On 19 February 1856, after Alexander Nikolayevich took the throne as Alexander II, the regiment was renamed as His Majesty's Life Hussar Regiment, and on 19 March 1857 it returned to the Pavlograd designation. It was reorganized with four active and two reserve squadrons on 14 May 1860. The 6th squadron was abolished in 1863, while the 5th squadron transferred to the reserve and separated from the regiment. In the same year it fought in the suppression of the Polish January Uprising, participating in fighting in what became Łomża Governorate. On 25 March 1864 it was numbered as the 2nd His Majesty's Pavlograd Life Hussar Regiment. In honor of its centenary, the regiment received a new St. George standard on 9 July, with the added inscription 1764–1864 and Alexander jubilee ribbon.
Grand Duke Tsesarevich Alexander Alexandrovich (later Alexander III) became second "chef" of the regiment on 26 February 1874. It was redesignated as a dragoon regiment and renumbered as the 6th on 18 August 1882. After the death of Alexander III, the regiment was named in honor of him on 2 November 1894, being redesignated as the 6th Imperator Alexander III Pavlograd Life Dragoon Regiment. The regiment became a hussar unit numbered 2nd again on 6 December 1907. Emperor Nicholas II appointed himself "chef" of the regiment on 14 May 1911. It was dissolved in early 1918.
In popular culture.
In Leo Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" characters Nikolai Rostov and Vasily Denisov are depicted as officers in the regiment. For narrative purposes, Tolstoy depicted the regiment as fighting in the Battle of Ostrovno, which it did not participate in.

Diuris fucosa

Diuris fucosa is a species of orchid that is endemic to New South Wales. It between four and seven leaves and up to four pale yellow flowers with a few brown striations. It is only known from two sites in "Callitris" woodland in the south of the state and is classed as "extinct" in Victoria.
Description.
"Diuris fucosa" is a tuberous, perennial herb with a loose tussock of between four and seven narrow linear leaves long and wide. Up to four pale yellow flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal is egg-shaped and held close to horizontally, long and wide. The lateral sepals are green, lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide and turned below horizontal and usually parallel to each other. The petals spread apart from each other, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide on a green to brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are oblong to wedge-shaped, long and wide with irregular edges. There are two thick, brown, pimply callus ridges near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris fucosa" was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Urana and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("fucosa") is a Latin word meaning "painted", "simulated" or "counterfeit", referring to the tan-brown markings on the labellum of this orchid.
Distribution and habitat.
This orchid grows in "Callitris" woodland in two locations between Urana and Narrandera, one in a state forest and the other on private property. There are two old collections from Victoria but the species is now classed as "extinct" in that state.

Council of Ministers of Lebanon

The Council of Ministers of Lebanon ("French": Conseil des Ministres du Liban) is the executive body of the Republic of Lebanon. Its president is the Prime Minister of Lebanon, and it is appointed by the President of Lebanon with confirmation of the Parliament of Lebanon. It is typically composed of an equal number of Muslims and Christians (although this requirement is not specified in the Constitution). The Council of Ministers is considered to be the "government" of Lebanon by the Constitution.
History.
The body was created on the 23rd of May 1926, when the Constitution of the state of Greater Lebanon was promulgated. From the creation of the office in 1926 to the end of the Civil War, the Constitution made little mention of the roles and duties of the office, albeit for a mention of the President to "nominate one of the ministers as Prime Ministers". Following the end of the Lebanese Civil War and the ratification of the Ta'if Accord, the responsibilities of the Council of Ministers were significantly strengthened, codified and clearly listed in the Constitution. Notably, the accord shifted the executive power from the President to the Council.
Formation of a Government.
The Council is formed by a Decree of the President of the Republic, which is countersigned by the Prime Minister. Within 30 days, the Chamber of Deputies must approve the Government through a vote of confidence, which requires a simple majority. By Article 64 of the Lebanese Constitution, it is the Prime Minister who assumes the negotiations with the Parliament for the formation of a government. By custom, the government is composed equally between Muslims and Christians - however, this is not a requirement specified in the Constitution.
Resignation of the Cabinet.
According to Article 69 of the Constitution, the government is considered resigned when:
Caretaker Government.
When the government is considered resigned (as per the conditions set above), or has not yet received a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, it can only operate "in the narrow sense of "conducting the business"".
In addition, the cabinet is a caretaker government when the term of the President of the Republic expires and the Parliament has not yet elected a new President. For example, this was the case for 2 years upon the expiration of President Michel Suleiman's term in 2014 up until the election of Michel Aoun on the 31st of October 2016, with Prime Minister Tammam Salam acting as its Head.
Responsibilities and Powers.
The council is generally tasked with overseeing daily affairs, and preparing bills for the House of Deputies to vote on. The individual ministers work on their own portfolios, and only need the signature of the President and the Prime Minister for decisions concerning their individual ministry. When decisions affect the entire government, a majority of the ministers are needed. For the government to consent on so-called "basic" issues (constitutional amendments, electoral laws, dissolving parliament, war and peace, intl. treaties, state of emergency, state budget, long-term development plans, appointing first-cadre state employees, redistricting, nationality laws, personal affairs law, dismissing ministers) a 2/3 majority of the ministers present is needed.
The following is a list of the powers of the Council of Ministers:
Powers in Relation to the President.
Prior to the Ta'if Accord, the role of Council was to give the President its "favourable advice" rather than a clear consensus/majority on the issues prescribed above. Nevertheless, as the president is the sole person who can nominate/remove the ministers and the entire government, it is bound to be favorable to him or her. In addition, the Constitution is silent on the issue of retaliation - where if the President has the authority to fire the government and sign a decree it did not approve of - however this issue has never arisen since the Cabinet generally deferential to the President (or vice versa).
Meetings &amp; Quorum.
The President of the Council of Ministers is the Prime Minister. He heads the meetings and calls ordinary meetings. Whenever the president attends, however, he chairs the meetings (but without voting on its decisions). In addition, the President can place any item he deems to be "urgent" on the agenda and order extraordinary sessions.
The quorum for a meeting is 2/3 of the ministers, and its decisions are taken by those present (voting by proxy is not allowed).
Secterian Representation Controversies.
There has been several controversies relating to sectarian groups and the power to topple the government. For example, in 2006, Hezbollah began mass demonstrations as all 5 Shiite and 1 Christian from resigned from the 24 member cabinet (2 short of the 1/3 needed to bring down the government) of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. This meant that there was effectively no Shiite representation in the Cabinet and a Christian majority. Nevertheless, the government continued to function for another 2 years until incumbent President Emile Lahoud's term ended in 2008.

Tail chasing

Tail chasing is a behaviour exhibited in dogs that is characterized by spinning in tight circles in either direction, and can be slow and focused on the tail or fast and unfocused. It is a compulsion similar to those seen in humans suffering from OCD and it can be quite disruptive to the lives of the dogs themselves, as well as their owners. Some causes have been suggested, including genetic factors, and environmental factors that vary depending on the individual dog. Furthermore, treatment options include drugs that decrease the frequency of tail chasing by targeting the underlying mechanisms, and behavioural changes regulated by the dog's owners.
Problematic behaviour.
It is common for problems to arise when dogs compulsively chase their tails. One case study described a dog who began to lose weight, demonstrated aggressive behaviour when its owner attempted to stop the chasing, and became uninterested in enjoyable daily activities, such as walks and eating. Another case study described a dog with similar symptoms but who also injured its tail and head while chasing its tail. Furthermore, with increased tail chasing behaviour, the injuries become more serious, such as fractures from the animals often banging into things while chasing their tails, getting skin abrasions and infections from creating open wounds on the tail, and abrasions on the pads of their feet. The most serious cases can result in amputation or even euthanasia if other treatments are unsuccessful. Surveys from owners suggest that tail chasing diminishes quality of life for the dog and usually interferes with the relationship between dog and owner.
Parallels with human disorders.
OCD.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in humans is characterized by the onset of intrusive, repetitive thoughts and urges (obsessions), that are typically eased through a certain behaviour (compulsions). In addition, it can present early in life or later. One study also found that OCD has a high comorbidity with other disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Dogs who chase their tails are often described as having Canine Compulsive Disorder (CD), as they seem to compulsively chase their tails, it has been described as appearing as early as two months old, and the behaviour can worsen or become more frequent when the animal is stressed.
ASD.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has also been known to develop early in life and a common symptom is repetitive behaviours. It has also been shown that most of the children with ASD were also hard to distract from any task they were focused on. Tail chasing has been compared to autism as it usually starts with random outbursts and then as the compulsion progresses, it becomes more frequent and more difficult to distract the dog from doing it. Bull Terriers who exhibit tail chasing have been found to have increased serum neurotensin and corticotropin-releasing hormone levels, an increase also seen in children with ASD. The same study found elevated noise sensitivity amongst the Bull Terriers who tail chased, which is a common sensitivity for people with ASD.
Causes and treatments.
Causes.
Tail chasing and other compulsive behaviours in dogs, such as fly snapping and blanket suckling, have been associated with breed, stressful situations, seizures, and possibly the CDH2 gene. Tail chasing behaviour is most common in Bull Terriers and German Shepherds, but can also be seen in other breeds, like Doberman Pinschers and Shiba Inus. A study in Japan found significant effect of breed on tail chasing, while another found bull terriers and German Shepherds had the earliest onset of the behaviour.
In regards to stressful situations, case studies have shown that common triggers for tail chasing are situations in which the dog is uncomfortable, such as meeting new people or anticipating a stressful event. Another study showed similar findings in that about 30% of owners reporting that stressful or frustrating situations triggered tail chasing.
Seizure activity has also been associated with tail chasing. A correlation between tail chasing and seizure activity was insignificant, but it was higher than the correlations between tail chasing and sex, trance-like behaviour, noises, and skin allergies, which are all also associated with tail chasing. Further, a case study showed seizure activity localized in the lateral hypothalamus or cerebellum as one of the diagnosing criteria in a dog who problematically chased its tail.
In terms of genetic contributions, there is some debate, as one finding suggests that all compulsive-type behaviours are linked to higher expression of the CDH2 gene, while another found no such correlation between gene and tail chasing behaviour.
Other potential causes have been suggested in addition to those listed above. One study suggests a possible influence of where the dog was bought (pet store or breeder), saying that dogs bought from pet stores were more likely to chase their tails, and they also suggested the possibility that being homed with other dogs may be a trigger. Another study found that tail chasing was more common in males than in females, suggesting a possible sex difference.
Treatments.
Treatment for tail chasing is usually a combination of drug and behavioural therapy that is suited to the cause of tail chasing for the specific animal. Fluoxetine, an SSRI used to treat compulsive disorders, is a common drug used to treat CD and tail chasing. One study did find that hypericin was more effective at treating tail chasing than fluoxetine. Other drugs used to treat tail chasing include sedatives such as acepromazine, for those who are triggered by stressful or fearful situations, and anti-seizure medication such as gabapentin, for those who have seizures that could be increasing the behaviour.
Behavioural treatment for tail chasing mainly involves physically inhibiting the dog from completing the behaviour (e.g. with a muzzle) by preventive measures or interrupting the behaviour. It is also important to keep a regular daily routine that includes walks and regular feeding times, and playing, while avoiding potential stressors, such as loud noises and strangers. In addition, it is also common to gradually return the dog into potentially stressful situations in a controlled manner to habituate them to normal activities while preventing triggering an episode.

East German Athletics Championships

The East German Athletics Championships () was an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the East German Athletics Federation, which served as the East German national championships for the sport. The three- or four-day event was held in summer months, varying from late June to early September, and the venue changed on an annual basis.
The German Athletics Championships had a long history dating back to 1898. Following the division of Germany as part of the end of World War II, the organising body of the all-Germany championships, German Athletics Association, remained based in West Germany. As a result, a new national competition and sports body was created in East Germany, starting from 1948. This competition predated the formal formation of the country, thus the first two editions in 1948 and 1949 were known as Eastern Zone Athletics Championships, reflecting the Soviet occupied area of the country.
Events.
The following athletics events were contested at the East German Championships:
Women competed in the 80 metres hurdles event until 1968, when it was replaced with the new 100 m international standard race. The women's distance races were gradually added, with the 1500 m included in 1967, the 3000 m in 1976, the marathon in 1982, and finally the 10,000 m in 1985. The women's pentathlon was later expanded to the standard heptathlon. Steeplechase, pole vault, triple jump, hammer throw and the 50 km walk remained the preserve of men only over the championships' lifetime.
The men's programme also varied, with early editions featured walks over 10 km, 25 km and 30 km, as well as a 200 metres hurdles race from 1952 to 1965.

Charles William Wendte

Charles William Wendte (June 11, 1844 – September 9, 1931) was a Unitarian minister, a writer, an author and editor of religious hymns, an advocate for woman suffrage, and a national spokesman for religious liberalism.
Biography.
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, son of Charles and Johanna (Ebeling) Wendte, he graduated from Meadville Theological School in 1867 and Harvard Divinity School in 1869. He was ordained as a Unitarian minister and served churches in Chicago; Cincinnati, Ohio; Newport, Rhode Island; Oakland, California; and Los Angeles. In the early 20th century, he returned to Massachusetts and worked in several churches in metropolitan Boston. He retired to Berkeley, California by 1926.
On June 22, 1880, he offered the opening invocation at the 1880 Democratic National Convention, calling the United States "an asylum and a refuge for the distressed and downtrodden throughout the world," and praying that "all sectional divisions and differences may cease forever among us."
Starting in 1886, he led the First Unitarian Church of Oakland through its early growth and the construction of its still-iconic building. His next pulpit was the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles in 1897.
In 1896, he strongly endorsed woman suffrage, writing:
The same enlightened confidence in human nature which led the fathers to found the Republic on manhood suffrage, and its saviors to confer the ballot on millions of emancipated slaves, should animate us, their successors, in bestowing equal political rights on that half of our population which is confessedly the most virtuous, order-loving and trustworthy. Until this is done there can be no true democracy among us, and our Republic is such only in name.
He served as secretary of the National Federation of Religious Liberals, 1908–20; secretary for Foreign Affairs of the American Unitarian Association, 1905–15; president of the Free Religious Association, 1910–14, and as president of the Unitarian Ministerial Union.
Personal life.
In 1896, he married Abbie Louise Grant (1857-1936).
He died on September 9, 1931, and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery.

Wilda Bennett

Wilda Bennett (December 19, 1894 – December 20, 1967) was an American actress in musical comedies and in film. Her tumultuous personal life also kept her in the headlines.
Early life.
Bennett was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Bennett's father was John H. Bennett, a city building inspector.
Career.
Bennett's Broadway credits included "Everywoman" (1911-1912), "A Good Little Devil" (1913), "The Only Girl" (1914-1915), "The Riviera Girl" (1917), "The Girl Behind the Gun" (1918-1919), "Apple Blossoms" (1919-1920), "Music Box Revue" (1921-1922), "The Lady in Ermine" (1922-1923), and the title role in "Madame Pompadour" (1924-1925). 
She had a "sweet" soprano voice.
Bennett's later stage appearances were in "Lovely Lady" (1928), and "Merrily We Roll Along" (1934). She reprised her title role in "The Only Girl" for a radio production in 1927.
Films featuring Wilda Bennett included "A Good Little Devil" (1914, lost), "Love, Honor and Obey" (1920), "Bullets or Ballots" (1936), "Dark Victory" (1939), "The Women" (1939), "What a Life" (1939), "Ninotchka" (1939), "Those Were the Days!" (1940), and "The Lady Eve" (1941).
Personal life.
Bennett's personal life involved multiple legal troubles that brought additional, ongoing, national press attention. In 1925, she was sued for $100,000 by a woman named Katherine Frey, who believed that Bennett had been her husband Charles Frey's lover. Katherine Frey won a judgment of $25,000 in the case. While the lawsuit was still pending, Charles Frey was driving Bennett's car when it struck a young woman, who was killed. Bennett was a passenger in the car. In 1927 she was sued for the care expenses of a horse she once owned. In 1928 she was sued for damages by a landlord who said Bennett destroyed furniture and removed other items from an apartment she rented. Bennett lost that case too, and had to pay $400 to her landlord. In 1930, she sued Anthony J. Wettach after another car accident; she ended up marrying him instead. In 1932, she was arrested on charges of being drunk and disorderly.
Bennett was married four times. Her husbands were, in order, producer (divorced in 1920), Argentine dancer Abraham "Peppy" de Albrew (married 1926, separated in 1927), Anthony J. Wettach (married 1930, divorced 1933), and mining engineer Munro Whitmore. Bennett was widowed when Munro Whitmore died in 1960. 
On December 20, 1967, one day after Bennett's 73rd birthday, she died in Winnemucca, Nevada.

Hungarian Historical Society

The Hungarian Historical Society () is a learned society in Hungary, established in 1867. Its main responsibilities are the cultivation of the History of Hungary, dissemination of scientific findings, supporting research and development and representing the history of Hungary domestically and around the world.
Aims.
The historical society's aims are:
History.
The Hungarian Historical Society was established on May 15, 1867. The first session to establish the society was held on 2 February 1867 which was summoned by Arnold Ipolyi. Here they discussed the ways in which the society was formed and chose a committee to elaborate the basic rules. The first General Assembly was held with 300 members at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. On 13 June Imre Mikó was elected to the chairman of the society, and acted as a leader until 1876.
21st century.
The goal of the new millennium was that the society renewed the old traditions of conferences and congresses related to the various significant anniversaries, and it began monthly talk series about "Critical Issues in the national history" and the modernization of Periodical Századok. The society celebrated its 150th anniversary on May 15, 2017, and on this occasion a memorial conference was held at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences on 6 December 2017.
Organisation.
The management and the Board of Directors is run by the General Assembly. The 20 members of the Board of Directors are elected by the ordinary Annual General Assembly meeting among regular members by secret ballot. The management is consisting of nine members: the chairperson, the five deputy chairpersons among whom one serves as an acting chairperson, the general secretary, the chairman of the Editorial Board of Periodical Századok and its editor-in-chief.
Types of the Publications of the Society.
The society published several journals, periodicals and books from its establishment, 1867, e.g monographs, book series, sourcebooks, study books, biographies, mémoires, e.g. about significant Hungarian historical persons like Ladislaus IV of Hungary, Louis I of Hungary, Mary, Queen of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, Tamás Bakócz, Sigismund Rákóczi, Péter Pázmány, Gabriel Bethlen, Miklós Zrínyi, George II Rákóczi, Emeric Thököly. In 1867 it established its most important periodical named "Századok" (Centuries) which has survived until now.

Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 () is a United States omnibus spending bill for the United States federal government for fiscal year 2018 enacted by the 115th United States Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 23, 2018.
Legislative history.
On the evening of March 21, 2018, the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 was released. The text was posted to the web site of the United States House Committee on Rules at 10:00p.m. H.R. 1625, formerly the TARGET act, was used as a legislative vehicle for the appropriations bill. At 10:15p.m., the Committee's Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) said he did not have a printout of the bill to consider. The Committee voted 8–3 to allow one hour of debate on the full bill and to disallow all points of order against the motion to add the more than 2,000 pages to the bill. The rule was filed at 1:20a.m. The one hour of debate began at 9:15a.m. Afterwards, James McGovern (D-Massachusetts) advocated to amend the bill further in order to be able to add text to adjust the status of unauthorized immigrants who entered the U.S. as children. The House voted 233–186 to disallow adding any text to the bill other than the more than 2,000 pages proposed the night before. 
Approximately 17 hours after the 2,232-page bill was released, the House of Representatives passed the bill 256–167 on March 22. That morning, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, "Is the president going to sign the bill? Yes. Why? Because it funds his priorities." The Senate passed the bill 65–32 after midnight on March 23.
The morning of March 23, President Donald Trump said he might veto the bill because it would not fully fund a planned wall along the Mexico–United States border and would not address the individuals who entered the United States as children and are present in the United States without legal status. President Trump signed the bill later in the day.

Celia Hempton

Celia Hempton (born Stroud, England) is a British artist based in London and has exhibited internationally across Europe, Asia and North and South America. Hempton is primarily a painter but works across different medias including sound and performance. Her primary artistic interest is feelings of discomfort and confronting those feelings.
In 2016, Hempton was included in Vitamin P3 as one of 'tomorrow's artists'.
Education.
Hempton studied Fine Art at Glasgow School of Art from 2000-2003 where she also played in a band called I Love Lucy. Hempton then moved to London and completed her MA in Painting at the Royal College of Art from 2005-2007.
Work.
Hempton is most famous for her series '"Chat Random"' (2014–ongoing), which consists of images of male genitalia found through the website Chatrandom.com. She cycles through the different live images of people she finds online using her laptop then begins to paint often using bright artificial colours. The works were first exhibited in 2014 and titled with the subject's country and the date she encountered them. Hempton sees this series as subverting the male gaze and uses her position as a woman to confront the taboo of painting a penis. The piece was included in Omar Kholeif's exhibition 'Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966) at the Whitechapel Gallery. 
Her paintings vary in size, sometimes mimicking a mobile or laptop screen, other times taking up a large scale.
In 2014 Hempton collaborated with her brother Sam Hempton to create a sound piece, which was made after a few days spent on the Volcano island of Stromboli.

2018 Mitre 10 Cup

The 2018 Mitre 10 Cup season was the thirteenth season of New Zealand's provincial rugby union competition since it turned professional in 2006. The regular season began on August 16, when North Harbour hosted Northland. It involved the top fourteen rugby unions of New Zealand. For sponsorship reasons, the competition was known as the Mitre 10 Cup and it was the third season under the lead sponsor. The winner of the Championship, Waikato was promoted to the Premiership, the seventh placed Premiership team, Taranaki was relegated to the Championship. 
Format.
The Mitre 10 Cup standings were sorted by a competition points system. Four points were awarded to the winning team, a draw equaled two points, whilst a loss amounted to zero points. Unions could also win their side a respectable bonus point. To receive a bonus point, they must have scored four tries or more or lose by seven or fewer points or less. Each team was placed on their total points received. If necessary of a tiebreaker, when two or more teams finish on equal points, the union who defeated the other in a head-to-head got placed higher. In case of a draw between them, the side with the biggest points deferential margin got rights to be ranked above. If they were tied on points difference, it was then decided by a highest scored try count or a coin toss. This seeding format was implemented since the beginning of the 2006 competition.
The competition included a promotion-relegation process with the winner of the Championship receiving automatic promotion to the Premiership, replacing the seventh-placed team in the Premiership which was relegated to the Championship for the following year. The regular season consisted of two types of matches. The internal division matches were when each team played the other six unions in their division once, home or away. The cross-division matches were when each team played four teams from the other division, thus missing out on three teams, each from the opposite division. Each union played home or away games against teams from the other division, making a total of ten competition games for each union. The finals format allowed the top four teams from each division move on to the semi-finals. The top two division winners, based on table points, received a home semi-final. In the first round of the finals, the semi-finals, the second division winner hosted the third division winner, and the first division winner hosted the fourth division winner. The final was hosted by the top remaining seed.
Regular season.
The 2018 Mitre 10 Cup played across nine weeks with every team playing one Wednesday night fixture in a double-up round where they played twice that week. The competition started on Thursday August 16, with North Harbour taking on Northland at QBE Stadium. The opening round saw a repeat of the Premiership final with Tasman against the then current champions Canterbury.
Ranfurly Shield.
Pre-season challenges.
In March 2018, Taranaki accepted Ranfurly Shield challenges from both Heartland Championship unions, Wanganui and Poverty Bay after the regular season draw was confirmed. Tikorangi and Hawera were chosen to host the Ranfurly Shield matches. Taranaki Rugby announced the venues for the pre-season defenses in mid April for July 28 and August 4 at the Tikorangi Domain and TSB Hub.

Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men (Pirenópolis)

The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was a Roman Catholic church located in Pirenópolis, in the Brazilian state of Goiás. It was built between 1743 and 1757 by a fraternity of black men, since Afro-Brazilians were forbidden from attending other local churches. It was demolished in 1944 by order of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Goiás. It was located where today stands the Praça do Coreto, which has a memorial in its honor. Of all the churches in the city, Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men contained the most altars; seven in total. According to journalist Jarbas Jayme, these altars were "artistically carved and of costly and beautiful architecture". Its main altar is now located within the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and its two lateral altars are now located in the Church of Our Lady of Carmo.
History.
The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was built between 1743 and 1757, according to the two documents available. It was built by thousands of slaves at a time when mining was the main economic activity of the city. It had a colonial style and its main altar had enthroned the image of Our Lady of the Rosary, now housed by the Church of Our Lady of Carmo. The two niches of this altar had images of Saint Raphael and Saint Benedict. Both images are now in the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. The right side altar was dedicated to Saint Sebastian, whose image was taken to the Church of Bonfim and stolen from there in 1978. The left side altar was dedicated to Saint Benedict the Moor, whose image is now in the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary.
With the end of the Brazilian Gold Rush in the late 18th century, the local economy began to base itself in agriculture and the city became impoverished. Nevertheless, the Fraternity of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men strove to preserve the church for the next centuries. For over a century after its construction the church had only one tower, on the west side. In 1870, a second tower was built in its east side. At the same time, restoration work was conducted on the roof and walls. In 1886 the old clock of the Mother Church – the first public clock in Pirenópolis – was transferred to the Church of the Rosary. After the signing of the Golden Law in 1888, the Black population of the city grew increasingly poor and in lack of funds to keep the church clean and well maintained.
In the early 20th century the church suffered from a series of alterations in its original aspect. Its towers, sacristy and consistory were destructed, and its façade was altered from its colonial style to a neo-Gothic one. The church was demolished in 1944 by order of then Bishop Emanuel Gomes de Oliveira. Its two lateral altars, along with its main altar, were taken to the Church of Our Lady of Carmo, while its bell was taken to the Church of Our Lord of Bonfim. Images, implements, vestments, furniture and other belongings of the church were distributed among the three other churches of the city. In 2002, after a fire partially destructed the Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, the main altar of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men was set up in that church.

Harald Christian Nielsen

Harald Nielsen (20 July 1892 – 22 December 1977) was a Danish designer of silver for Georg Jensen. The younger brother of Georg Jensen's third wife, he joined the company at 17 as a chaser's apprentice but later became one of the company's leading designers in the 1920s and 1930s and Jensen's closest colleague, One of his most well-known designs being the pyramid flatware pattern. In the early 1950s he headed the company's apprentice school and in 1958 became its artistic director.
Early life.
Nielsen was born in Bårse, Vordingborg Municipality, the youngest child of parish priest Søren Nielsen and Lydia Kold. His father died when he was just one year old and his mother then moved the family to Copenhagen. He had aspirations to become a painter but the family's difficult economic situation did not allow it. His eldest sister, Johanne, married Georg Jensen in 1907. In 1909, Nielsen began an apprenticeship as a chaser in his brother-in-law's silver workshop. The company paid for his drawing lessons with Carl V. Meyer.
Career.
Still an apprentice, Nielsen created the drawings for one of the workshop's catalogues. He briefly made another attempt to become a painter but was shortly thereafter once again employed by Georg Jensen, creating drawings based on Jensen's and Johan Rohde's sketches for the silversmiths to work after. He also began to create his own designs, developing his own style.
He received the K. A. Larssens Legat in 1921. He was appointed to deputy director of the company in 1958. He retired in 1962 but remained an artistic consultant until 1967.
Works.
Nielsen mostly designed hollow ware. His works are well-proportioned and characterized by a refined sense of style.
He also designed two sets of cutlery, "Pyramid" (1927–29) and "Dobbeltriflet" (1947) as well as a few pieces of jewellery.
Exhibition.
His works were part of Georg Jensen's contribution to the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925 and he was also represented at all other Georg Jensen exhibitions over the next decades. His 60 years birthday in 1932 was celebrated with a special exhibition at Georg Jensen &amp; Wendel in Copenhagen.
Nielsen's works are represented in the collections of the Danish Design Museum as well as several international museums.

Lisa Lines

Lisa Margaret Lines (born 18 July 1980) is an academic editor, historian, author and former lecturer in history at the University of New South Wales Canberra. She specialises in the history of the Spanish Civil War and the prevalence and influence of plagiarism and academic integrity in higher education.
Education and career.
Lines completed a Bachelor of Arts, an Honours degree and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Creative Writing at the University of Adelaide and a Honours degree and PhD in History at Flinders University. Lines has lectured at Flinders University, the University of Adelaide, the University of South Australia and the University of New South Wales. In 2007, Lines founded Elite Editing, serving as Director and Head Editor until selling the business in 2014. After her tenure at the University of New South Wales, Lines founded Capstone Editing, a specialist academic editing company. Capstone Editing is currently owned by Zacharia Bruckner.
Lines authored a book on "milicianas"—female participants in the Spanish Civil War—exploring their origins in the Republican reaction to the coup of 1936 and contributions as frontline and rearguard combatants during the first year of the war (after which women were largely removed from combat roles). Lines has also argued for a re-evaluation of General Franco's military leadership, strategy and political acumen during the Spanish Civil War, reasoning that Franco's prolonging of the war was purposefully done to solidify his control of the Nationalist camp, ensure the complete destruction of the Republican forces and establish the foundation for his position as head of state in the post-war years.
Research.
Lines has criticised the current climate of Australian universities as overcommercialised, apathetic towards student needs, enabling of a monopolised textbook industry and overpriced textbooks, and unwilling to admit or confront the rising issue of ghostwriting for university students. Lines has also highlighted the under-representation of women in senior levels of academia.
Other work.
Lines currently serves on the committees of several editing industry organisations, including the Institute of Professional Editors (IPEd), and has pushed strongly for the professionalisation of the Australian editing industry.
Court case and missing persons.
Lines served as a witness in the attempted murder trial of her ex-partner, Mr Jonathon Hawtin ("R v Hawtin" in the Supreme Court of South Australia). The trial followed an incident in October 2017, in which Hawtin allegedly attempted to murder Mr Bruckner, with both being severely injured. Hawtin was acquitted by a jury in September 2019.
In April 2021, The Australian reported that Interpol had issued "yellow notices" for Lines' two children, Parker and Savannah. A yellow notice is "issued for victims of parental ­abductions, kidnappings or unexplained disappearances". It is believed Lines went overseas with the children in 2020.

Janne Sirén

Janne Sirén (born September 29, 1970, in Helsinki) is a Finnish art historian and the Peggy Pierce Elfvin Director of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. Before joining the Albright-Knox, Sirén served as Director and City of Helsinki Department Chief at the Helsinki Art Museum from 2007 to 2013. Prior to that, he served as Director of the Tampere Art Museum from 2004 to 2007.
Early life and education.
Sirén was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of Aivi Gallen-Kallela and Matti Sirén. He is the great-grandson of Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a painter whose work is considered to be extremely important to Finnish national identity.
Sirén attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he majored in art history and took courses on philosophy and Italian language and culture. After obtaining his B.A. in 1993, he pursued an M.A. at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. There he wrote two qualifying papers—one in his major field titled “Intersecting Paths in the History of Modern European Painting: An Investigation of Edvard Munch’s Influence on Henri Matisse, 1895–1908,” and a second in his minor field titled “Melodies in Blue and White: Luca della Robbia at Santa Maria Impruneta and the Cultural Stance of Terracotta Invetriata in Quattrocento Florence.”
In 2001, Sirén received his PhD from the Institute of Fine Arts. His dissertation, “Axel Gallén and the Constructed Nation: Art and Nationalism in Young Finland, 1880–1900,” discussed the role the work of his grandfather played in the construction of Finnish national identity. It was nominated by the Institute of Fine Arts Faculty Committee for New York University’s “Outstanding Dissertation of the Year” award. His dissertation advisor was pioneering feminist and post-colonialist art historian Linda Nochlin.
Career.
Sirén began his professional career in the Department of Art History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he was an assistant professor from 2000 to 2004. His teaching included courses on American and European art from the Renaissance to the present, aesthetics, critical theory, and museology.
In 2004, Sirén began his tenure as Director of the Tampere Art Museum in southern Finland. While there, he also served as Deputy Director of the Tampere Museums Department. In 2007, he left Tampere and accepted the position of Director and City of Helsinki Department Chief at the Helsinki Art Museum. The museum’s collection comprises more than 9,000 works, nearly half of which are on display in public locations in and around Helsinki.
In 2013, Sirén returned to the United States and joined the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, as Peggy Pierce Elfvin Director. He was preceded at the Albright-Knox by Louis Grachos, who was appointed the Ernest and Sarah Butler Executive Director and CEO of The Contemporary Austin in 2013. At the Albright-Knox, Sirén oversees a world-renowned collection of modern and contemporary art containing more than 7,000 artworks. He has curated or co-curated several major exhibitions, including "Anselm Kiefer: Beyond Landscape" (2013), "Monet and the Impressionist Revolution, 1860–1910" (2015), and "Picasso: The Artist and His Models" (2016).
Sirén’s tenure at the Albright-Knox has been defined by a massive campus expansion project entitled AK360. He has overseen all aspects of the project and has spearheaded a $155 million capital campaign. Under his leadership, the Albright-Knox raised $125 million between June 2016 and March 2018, including a $42.5 million matching challenge from businessman and investor Jeffrey Gundlach, the largest single philanthropic gift in the history of Western New York. In November 2017, Gundlach announced a second AK360 matching challenge of $10 million for funds raised through November 2018.
Personal life.
Sirén lives in Buffalo, New York, with his wife Sonja, whom he met in Israel while she was pursuing her doctoral studies on security policy and human rights in Nordic countries. They have three children.

Reception.

Yamaha DX21

The Yamaha DX21 is a digital controlled bi-timbral programmable analog synthesizer with a four operator synth voice generator which was released in 1985. It uses sine wave-based Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis. It has two FM tone generators and a 32-voice random-access memory (RAM), 32 user voices and 128 read-only memory (ROM) factory preset sounds. As a programmable synth, it enables users to create their own unique synthesized tones and sound effects by using the algorithms and oscillators. The instrument weighs 8 kg (17.6 lbs). On its release, it sold for $795.
Keyboard.
The keyboard has 61 keys which are not velocity-sensitive to harder or softer key presses. It can produce eight note polyphony, which means up to eight keys can be pressed at once. In split keyboard mode, the polyphony limit is still eight notes, but there is a maximum of four for the lower half and four for the upper half. In mono mode, the DX21 can play only one note, unless the keyboard is split; if the keyboard is split, the DX21 can do one mono voice for the lower split and one mono voice for the upper split.
MIDI and jacks.
The DX21 is MIDI compatible, which enables performers to use the DX21 to control other digital instruments (e.g., a drum machine or other synth), or use other MIDI-compatible controllers or devices to play the DX21's synthesized sounds. The DX21 has 1/4" jacks for plugging in a sustain pedal, a portamento pedal, and a volume expression pedal and an input for a BC-1 breath controller. The DX21 has MIDI in, out and thru jacks, which enable the instrument to be connected to a computer, drum machine, sequencer, or other MIDI-compatible device. The CPU is a HD63803XP Hitachi and the sound generation chip is the YM2164. The DAC is a YM3012.
The instrument has an un-backlit LCD panel which indicates the name of the voice or sound and provides information on the status of the instrument. A split point can be set on the keyboard, to enable part of the keyboard to be used with one sound and part for another sound. For example, a bass sound could be put on the left side of the keyboard, and a flute sound on the other half. The DX21 also has a modulation wheel and a pitch bend wheel. The two tone generators are output via two output jacks. Thus to hear tone generator A and tone generator B, a user would need to plug in two cables into a stereo keyboard amplifier, PA system, or other audio gear.
Sounds and effects.
The 128 ROM preset voices can be grouped into 16 categories: piano; electric piano; organ; strings; brass; plucked strings; "comping" (accompanying instruments); percussion 1; percussion 2; lead synth; other keyboards; wind reeds; bass; and three sound effect categories, which include sounds such as "racing car", "helicopter", "whistling", and basic sounds such as "LFO noise". Users can save their own newly-created synth tones to an external cassette recorder. It has an onboard chorus effect. The low frequency oscillator (LFO) has modulators for amplitude and pitch, using saw, square, triangle wave shapes. For attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR) control, also called "envelope", there are four envelopes.
Users.
Notable users include: Hardfloor, Level 42, Brother Beyond, Xiu Xiu, Astral Projection, Technotronic, Vangelis, and Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim).
DX100.
The DX100 was also released in 1985. It uses similar electronics to provide a keyboard with 49 minikeys that is smaller and easier to carry. The DX100 is a 4-operator FM synthesizer that is monotimbral. It has no filters or effects. It has 192 preset voices and 24 user-programmable voices. It has MIDI capabilities and MIDI in/out and thru jacks. It has a single mono output, a single footswitch jack for a sustain pedal or portamento pedal and a BC1 breath controller jack.
Comparison with DX7.
The DX21 has 4 operators and 8 algorithms. The DX7 has 6 operators and 32 algorithms.

Léto s Oskarem

Léto s Oskarem (English: "Summer with Oscar") is a 1998 Czech adventure game authored by Pavel Širůček and distributed by Vochozka Trading.
Production.
Two friends, Petr Vochozka and Jan Kudera, decided to set up a gaming studio in Brno, which they named Illusion Softworks. Their first game was a platform game called Lurid Land. Their second title, "Léto s Oskarem," was the last game Vochozka Trading made, afterwards most of their staff went to work for Illusion Softworks. While the game was released in 1998, it was originally meant to be released sooner; Excalibur argued the delay was due to the developers promising many features and benefits never-before-seen in adventure gaming, a claim the magazine argued was never fulfilled. Databaze-her notes the title was " postponed several times and many of the previously announced improvements were not implemented in ".
The team were inspired to continue the tone set in earlier humor-focused games from Vochozka such as "7 days and 7 nights". The game was developed primarily for MS-DOS and ran in a VGA resolution of 640×480, later they began working on a Windows version as the game developed; these floppy disk versions came without sound, while a later CD-ROM edition had full dubbing. The game contained background music but no sound. According to an interview with the author of the game Pavel Širůček for Score magazine, the initial sketches of the game were made by Tomáš Svoboda on paper, which was subsequently scanned into a computer.
The development team was four-person strong. Pavel Širůček was author and creative director. Sounds and music provided by Pavel Olšanský. The graphic designer was Tomáš Svoboda, who also created the comic book in the enclosed manual; he also contributed to the previous game Hidden &amp; Dangerous 1, and would later work for Pterodon. Programming of the game itself led by Petr Bělík. The characters are performed by professional actors from the Goose on a String Theater () - 1998 was the year ullt professional dubbing hit Czech adventure gaming.
"Léto s Oskarem" was one of the few titles Petr Vochozka developed in his own office, his main business was in publishing games created by other developers and localising Polish games.
Plot and gameplay.
In this "a typical Czech comedy" adventure, the player takes control of Oskar Sláma, who is so bad at school that his parents send him off to live with his grandparents in a rural village of Kotěhůlkách. He reluctantly accepts in order to receive his inheritance.
The game is a classic point and click adventure game. The inventory is located in the top part of the screen. The dialogue screen offers three ways for the player to react: charming, rude, or altruistic. The humour is in the vein of Leisure Suit Larry. The game is very short, and contains many animations. It contained background music but no sound effects. The game contains eight locations, 80 game screens, and around 30 characters. Each clickable element has a humorous note attached. The game has an average of 5 animations per screen, including animations triggered from prolonged inactivity and those independent to player's actions.
Reception.
Bonusweb.cz felt the game was "ever-stagnant". Excalibur noted that the game is obscure when compared to contemporary Czech adventures, and was less commercially successful. In addition, the magazine argues it's one of the less difficult Czech adventures, and that the game contains outdated humour on groups such as women and homosexuals. Excalibur thought the game was a failure due to failing to deliver on their promised features and for being graphically outdated at the time of release. Databaze-her thought the game was "characterized by lower difficulty and certain technological obsolescence". Vision Game deemed Oskat Slama a mixture of America's Leisure Suit Larry and Polish character Agent Mlíčňák. Shark felt the game was a "total flop". Gamifique argued that the game was Petr Vochozka's way of supporting Czech production.
Tiscali notes that 1998 was a significant year for the Czech game scene as the year íolda, Horké léto, Léto s Oskarem, and Brány Skeldalu were released. Level felt the game's graphic design was "at the level of games several years old, and concluded: "It is a typical Czech product, created with an idea and taste, it just wanted better crayons and probably a bigger investment". Various magazines compared Horke Leto to this title, due to them coming out at a similar time and having similar themes; they however would favour Horke Leto, with Score commenting that the game was "a good plaster for wounds caused by Léto s Oscarem [sic]". Bonusweb felt it was a "pity" the title was released in an unfinished state. Doupe felt the game was a cult classic, still enjoyed and fondly remembered by many players. Vizuálny štýl českých a slovenských adventúr medzi rokmi 1990 až 1999 felt that while the game often goes for visual realism, it sometimes slips into cartoony graphics in the style of 7 dní a 7 nocí, and noted that the game mechanics were far from the quality of foreign titles such as Broken Sword 2 (1997) or Monkey Island 3 (1997).

Recap.
Men.
Short program.
Nathan Chen finished first after the short program, with his American teammate Jason Brown finishing in second place. Chen was satisfied with his performance, saying, "There are always things I can do better, things I can improve on but ultimately everything I did, I did as best as I could and I hope to continue that into the free program". Brown's short program, despite not having any quad jumps in comparison to his competitors, has been praised as one of the best short programs of the season. After moving to Toronto in the off-season, Brown reflected on his new found maturity, noting, "There's a bit of confidence, a maturity confidence. As far as the skating goes, there's still a lot of changes that we have to make, but as the season's gone on, I've gotten a lot more confidence. I think it's a sense of maturity, the way that I'm carrying myself." Two-time Olympic and World Champion Yuzuru Hanyu, rounded out the top 3 despite doubling his quad salchow attempt. While commenting about his performance at the press conference Hanyu expressed his surprise of being awarded third place, despite missing the second half of the season due to an injured ankle, "I'm disappointed with my short program, I made a big mistake and I've got to reform and improve for the free skate, but I'm honoured to be in the top three." Four Continents Bronze Medallist Vincent Zhou finished in fourth, European bronze medallist Matteo Rizzo was fifth, while Four Continents champion, Olympic silver medallist and two-time defending silver medallist Shoma Uno completed the top six.
Free skate.
Chen maintained the lead he gained in the short program, becoming the first American male skater to defend a World Title since Scott Hamilton in 1984. He finished 22 points ahead of Hanyu, who became the first skater to break the 200-point mark since the introduction of the +5 GOE system, marking the fifth consecutive year of a Japanese skater winning the silver medal. Hanyu was called for an under-rotation and uneasy landing on his quad salchow, missed half of the season due to a lingering ankle injury and was proud of his performance despite not having enough strength in his ankle. Zhou's bronze medal was his first major ISU Championship senior medal, making himself and Chen the first two American men to make the world championship podium since 1996. After breaking the free skate world record at Four Continents, Uno's fourth-place finish was a shock to the home crowd—with a fall on his quad flip, an under-rotation on a combination jump and incomplete landing call on his opening quad salchow—was notably in tears when speaking to Japanese media stating feelings of regret and disappointment. When reflecting on his season, Uno was upset at his performance "If I recall, there are more competitions that I got disappointed over joyful ones in this season, [...] Overall, I am still disappointed in myself. I need to become much stronger mentally." Jin Boyang finished in fifth with two triple Axels and a big cheer from the crowd, with his performance component score bringing down his marks. Despite a second-place finish in the short program, Brown could not maintain his lead and dropped to ninth overall after a messy free skate, including a fall on his quad salchow, although was positive about his incredible improvement throughout the season. Kevin Aymoz suffered an injury to his hands after cutting them when trying to save a jump gone wrong, resulting in blood dripping on the ice.
Ladies.
Short program.
2018 Olympic gold medallist Alina Zagitova took the lead in the short program, ahead of home crowd favourite and Japanese national champion Kaori Sakamoto who achieved a personal best score after performing a near perfect triple flip-triple toe-loop combination. Zagitova mentioned that she was nervous before beginning her program as she had experienced several mistakes and errors throughout the season, although stated that she felt more mentally prepared in comparison to the rest of her season. Sakamoto was pleased with her performance, "I was able to execute everything as I did in practice and will aim to do that again in the free skate." Zagitova's training partner Elizabet Tursynbaeva, surprised both critics and the crowd to finish in third. After a rocky season, two-time world champion Evgenia Medvedeva finished fourth by achieving a seasons best for a short program that was first performed in December, receiving a standing ovation from the Japanese crowd despite an under-rotation call on her triple toe-loop. Short program world record holder and Grand Prix Final champion, Rika Kihira finished in seventh after singling her triple Axel attempt. 2017 World bronze medallist and 2018 Olympic Team Champion Gabrielle Daleman made her return to international competition after taking personal leave for mental health reasons, finishing in 11th despite skating clean.
Free skate.
Zagitova took first in the free skate to win her first world title, becoming the first female skater since Yuna Kim to complete a Career Grand Slam after silver medal finishes at the Grand Prix Final and Europeans. When speaking to the media Zagitova stated "I realized that I needed a clean skate and I went into each jump determined to land it". Tursynbaeva became the first senior woman to land a quad jump, completing a clean quad salchow in the free skate to take silver for Kazakhstan, their first in any discipline since Denis Ten in 2015. Tursynbaeva couldn't believe she landed her quad after falling in her previous two attempts in competition. Medvedeva narrowly beat Kihira for the bronze by a tenth of a mark, despite Kihira beating Medvedeva in the free skate the deficit from the short program it was not enough to change the standings. Kihira's Japanese team mates, short program silver medallist Sakamoto and Satoko Miyahara finished fifth and sixth, respectively, with Sakamoto popping her planned triple-flip which cost her a place on the podium. The judging panel came under scrutiny with Medvedeva not being called for her lutz performed with the wrong edge, with critics and fans criticising a lack of consistency amongst the judging of other skaters, marring the final result.
Pairs.
Short program.
Evgenia Tarasova &amp; Vladimir Morozov finished the short program by breaking the world record, competing with their 2018 Olympic short program. In their second competition of the season, 2017 World Champions Sui Wenjing &amp; Han Cong finished in second place, with their training partners and compatriots Peng Cheng &amp; Jin Yang finishing in third. Event favourites Vanessa James &amp; Morgan Cipres struggled with the short program once again, after James accidentally collided with Matteo Guarise in the warm-up that left both athletes shaken. Guarise was left with bruises on his left hip and pain in his left knee, "I wanted to slow down when I saw Vanessa, I am a big guy and she is so tiny. I didn't want to hurt her." James, who was left uninjured, when discussing the incident with Olympic Channel she noted, "we've had some hard situations but we always push through them."
Free skate.
Sui and Han broke the free skate world record to win their second world title in three years, with the skates by the top four considered to be one of the best in recent world championships, with Sui and Han's considered one of the best pairs free skates of all time. Sui discussed the difficulties and challenges they had throughout the season while recovering from ankle surgery, Sui noted to the media "In the short, we performed very well, and as the last to go on today, we knew that if we did well and challenged ourselves, we would win." Although Morozov stumbled his side-by-side jump, he and his partner Tarasova finished in second place, with their compatriots Natalia Zabiiako and Alexander Enbert taking a surprising bronze medal after finishing in fourth in the short program. Despite finishing third in the free skate and fifth overall, James and Cipres were frustrated with their performances, with Cipres adding although they were proud of their performance, "we want this title, everybody knows that we can do it, we know that we can do it, and we are going to do it."
Ice dance.
Rhythm dance.
Defending world champions Gabriella Papadakis &amp; Guillaume Cizeron completed the Rhythm Dance with a five-point lead over the Russian team of Victoria Sinitsina &amp; Nikita Katsalapov. Papadakis stated that an improvement of their technique training helped them gain the points advantage they wanted going into the free skate, calling their skate "the best performance". Olympic Ice Dance Champion Meryl Davis, praised Papadakis and Cizeron for their performance, calling it "very special, [...] remarkable" and "in a class of their own". Alexandra Stepanova &amp; Ivan Bukin finished in third, leading by 0.01 over Americans and defending silver medallists Madison Hubbell &amp; Zachary Donohue. Hubbell was positive about their performance as they had improved their technical score, which was their main goal for their performance. The reigning bronze medallists, Kaitlyn Weaver &amp; Andrew Poje finished in fifth, with Weaver calling their performance "a magical experience [...] but not perfect". Laurence Fournier Beaudry &amp; Nikolaj Sorensen made their first appearance for Canada after competing for Denmark in previous championships, with Sorensen suffering a wardrobe malfunction that placed them in tenth.
Free dance.
Papadakis and Cizeron maintained their lead from the Rhythm Dance winning their fourth World Title in five years by finishing eleven points higher overall than silver medallists Sinitsina and Katsalapov, with the French team's only loss being to Tessa Virtue &amp; Scott Moir in 2017. Cizeron was happy with their performance, while Papadakis reflected at the last time the world championships were in Saitama, "we were exactly here five years ago for the worlds in Saitama and it's funny to remember the whole experience we came in this five years, where we were at the time and where we are now". Katsalapov achieved his first major ISU Championship medal since his bronze medal at the Sochi Olympics with previous partner Elena Ilinykh, while it was current partner Sinitsina first overall. Sinitsina and Katsalapov were also the first Russian Ice Dance team to finish on the worlds podium since Ekaterina Bobrova &amp; Dmitri Soloviev in 2013. Hubbell and Donohue took the bronze ahead of Stepanova and Bukin, making it the fifth consecutive year of an American Ice Dance team finishing on the podium. Hubbell explained how their partnership had improved throughout the year and the risk to change their program choreography weeks before the world championship, "to be able to skate an emotionally strong performance as well as a technically strong performance, it's what every athlete wants." Despite receiving a standing ovation from the crowd, Stepanova and Bukin's technical content was not enough to push them into the top three, missing by two points. Weaver and Poje completed the top five, despite missing the first half of the season, performing a tribute program to late skater Denis Ten.

Controversy.
Mariah Bell/Lim Eun-soo collision.
During a practice session run-through of American skater Mariah Bell's short program, Bell skated past Korean skater Lim Eun-soo, who was along the baseboards. As Bell approached, her toe-pick scraped the back of Lim's left calf, causing a minor injury. Bell had right-of-way on the ice at the time due to it being her program run-through. Lim's management agency, All That Skate, claimed that the incident was a deliberate attack by Bell on her training teammate in Rafael Arutyunyan's coaching group, while Bell said it was an accident. Because Bell's music was playing during practice, she had the right-of-way at the time and Lim should have been aware of where Bell was on the ice. ISU released a statement clearing Bell of wrongdoing in the incident. U.S. Figure Skating extended an apology to the Korean Skating Union over the incident.

Sedan High School

Sedan Junior and Senior High School is a public middle and high school in Sedan, Kansas, United States. It is the sole high school operated by Chautauqua County USD 286 school district, and serves students of grades 7 to 12. The school colors are blue and white and the school mascot is the blue devil.
History.
Sedan High School graduated its first class of five students in 1889. By 1949, the school had graduated a total of 946 students in its first fifty years. In the 2019–2020 school year, there were 163 students enrolled in grades 7–12, and a student to teacher ratio of 11.81.
In 1900, the hardwood floors of the first school building were replaced, and a new school building was built in 1904.
The curriculum in 1902 consisted of "Virgil, Trigonometry and Political Economy... Caesar, Geometry, Political Economy and Chemistry".
By 1923, "The Sedan Times-Star" reported, "In our school district, No. 44, we have invested in buildings and equipment approximately $100,000.00 and our operating expense is from $35,000.00 to $40,000.00 per year." The paper also noted the school's membership in the North Central Association of high schools that had been formed in 1895.
A Works Progress Administration project took place at the school in 1937.
In 1960, a $380,000 bond issue was approved to construct a new building. The contract for the building went to H. D. Perkins Construction Co., Bartlesville, Oklahoma, with a bid of $181,229.
The attorney for Unified School District 286 requested an opinion of the state's attorney general in 1994 to determine whether the school mascot, the blue devil, was a religious symbol in violation of the U.S. Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibiting establishment of a state religion. Attorney General Bob Stephan published a legal opinion that the mascot was unlikely to be perceived in a religious context.

Tagaytay–Calamba Road

The Tagaytay–Calamba Road is a two- to four-lane, secondary and tertiary road in Laguna and Cavite, Philippines. Albeit discontinuous, it connects the city of Calamba in Laguna and the city of Tagaytay in Cavite. The road's missing link that will connect its Tagaytay and Calamba sections is under construction.
The segment of road from its western terminus at Tagaytay Rotonda to Ligaya Drive, both in Tagaytay, forms part of National Route 421 (N421) of the Philippine highway network, while the rest of the road remains unnumbered.
Route description.
Tagaytay.
The road starts at the Tagaytay Rotonda, a four-way roundabout with Aguinaldo Highway, Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway, and Tagaytay–Talisay Road in Tagaytay City. Various restaurants, hotels, residential developments, and tourists attractions could be found along this road. It then intersects the Santa Rosa–Tagaytay Road, which provides access to the South Luzon Expressway, and Ligaya Drive, where N421 turns towards Talisay, Batangas and the road transitions from a secondary road to a tertiary road. It then climbs Mount Sungay and terminates at the People's Park in the Sky. The entire Tagaytay segment is also known as Isaac O. Tolentino Avenue, after the former Tagaytay mayor who served from 1954 to 1980.
Calamba.
The road continues at the southwestern boundary of Calamba, Laguna, running east from the gate to Tagaytay Highlands. Entirely a tertiary road, it is divided and locally known as "Burol Road", "Lawa–Punta Road", and "Barandal Road", after the barangays those roads traverse through, respectively. It runs beneath the South Luzon Expressway before terminating at Manila South Road (Old National Highway) in barangay Parian.

Process–architecture–optimization is a development model for central processing units (CPUs) that Intel adopted in 2016. Under this three-phase (three-year) model, every microprocessor die shrink is followed by a microarchitecture change and then by one or more optimizations. It replaced the two-phase (two-year) tick–tock model that Intel adopted in 2006. The tick–tock model was no longer economically sustainable, according to Intel, because production of ever smaller dies becomes ever more costly.

Ve stínu havrana

Ve stínu havrana (English: In the Raven Shadow) is a 1999 Czech-Slovak adventure game developed by Rainbow Rhino and published by CINEMAX.
Production.
The game was created by Rainbow Rhino.
The first edition of the game became sold out in less than a year. The title saw three editions, and became a magazine attachment 8 times; it was played by 250,000 players.
In 2008, work was being done on a second game, however it was never released. The game is currently available on Steam, and was uploaded on July 12, 2017.
Plot and gameplay.
The player takes control of the good-natured monk Severin, who one day "escapes" from the monastery and decides to seek his way of life.
Critical reception.
Gamershell found enjoyment from the game despite its bare sound and visuals, and silly script. Absolute Games offered a mixed assessment of the game. Just Adventure decided that players willing to overlook the game's technical limitations would find enjoyment from its witty sense of humour. Bonusweb.cz felt that if the idea of the game bored players, they could wait another week for Czech adventure game Hot Summer 2 to be released. Bonusweb asserted that the game is likely known by every Czech computer player.
Sequel.
Cinemax announced works on Ve stínu havrana 2 in 2007. It was scheduled for a release in the second quarter of 2008. It was a collaboration between House of Dragonflies and Cinemax, and contained the work of graphic designers Erik Sille and Boris Sirka. The game's plot would have seen the monk Severin be trapped between medieval Europe, and futuristic world guided by Plato's philosophy of perfect States. The game was inspired by the works of PKDick, W. Gibson, and T. Giliam's film productions. It was a 3D point-and-click adventure with a non-linear story, while featuring limited RPG elements. The game was reported as being make completely in Czech, including its dubbing. It promised to touch on historical themes and insights into philosophy, religion, mathematics, and cybernetics. Development was eventually cancelled. Bonusweb felt it was a shame the project never took off, as it seemed like an "interesting psychedelic affair".

Friction hydro pillar processing

Friction hydro-pillar processing (FHPP) is a solid-state joining technology which can be used for filling of surface and sub-surface cracks in thick metals. For example, FHPP was attempted for the first time to repair cracks in space shuttle external components of high-strength aluminum alloys. FHPP is also considered in repairing surface cracks in steam turbine rotors of a high-strength, high-temperature-resistant steel (grade 26NiCrMoV14-5) (Ref). Alternative methods such as fusion welding processes for in-service repairing of cracks in components of these high-strength steels remained difficult because of their high hardenability and mandatory need of pre-heating and post-weld heat treatment. In contrast, initial FHPP trials could achieve joint strengths up to 90% of the base materials in high-strength steel components, especially those used for petrochemical and thermal power plants. In particular, pressurized pipes and vessels of AISI 4140 steel are widely used in the power generation, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. Initial studies on FHPP of this alloy have showed promising results. 
Fusion welding of AISI 4140 steel is usually recommended in annealed condition and with low hydrogen diffusible filler wires of relatively lower strength, e.g., ER70S-2 and ER80S-D2, because of the very high hardenability of Cr-Mo steels. Careful pre-heating and post weld heat treatments procedures must be followed to avoid cold cracking, reduce residual stresses and decrease impairment of HAZ properties in fusion welding of Cr-Mo and high carbon steels. Since FHPP is a solid-state joining process, several of the aforementioned issues can be alleviated. A systematic analysis of FHPP of Cr-Mo and Carbon steels is therefore needed but scarce in the literature.
An increase in stud force led to faster plastic flow of the stud and therefore reduced the overall processing time and peak temperature. However, the effect of the reduced processing time and lower peak temperature on the joint properties were not well addressed in the literature. Improper selection of the stud force often led to "lack of filling" defects near the crack hole bottom in FHPP of high-strength steels. FHPP is also attempted under the water to reduce the peak temperature in components of high-strength line pipe X65 steels (Ref). However, the resulting joint exhibited a full martensite structure due to higher cooling rates. A fairly uniform hardness distribution across the joint was reported in FHPP of C-Mn steel especially at lower stud forces (Ref). Although these studies provided an insight into FHPP of steels, a quantitative understanding of the effect of process variables on the temperature field, cooling rate and resulting joint hardness distribution remained scarce in FHPP of high-strength steels.

Piposh

Piposh () is an Israeli media franchise that started as a series of comedic point-and-click adventure video games developed by Guillotine and published by Hed Arzi Multimedia for Windows. Based on an eponymous actor-turned-detective who embarks on several adventures solving murders, the titles include "Piposh", "Piposh 2", "Halom SheItgashem" (spinoff), and "Piposh 3D: HaMahapecha". An English version of "Piposh" entitled "Piposh: Hollywood" was published in 2002. The series, which began in 1999, was created at a time when the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak, particularly in terms of adventure gaming, and served as a notable example of a work targeted specifically at the young local market, with aspects such as inside jokes relating to Israeli culture. The games became very popular within Israel, although never becoming financially successful, and its developers struggled to live off the proceeds.
"Piposh" evolved into a franchise, with a television series, a comic book, and an album being created. The series continues to have a dedicated fanbase, and Piposh conventions have been regularly held as a way for fans to celebrate the games together. While the titles have often been criticized for their amateurish visual style and clunky game mechanics, they are looked at fondly by critics who see "Piposh" as a source of Israeli pride and a key milestone in the advancement of the local industry throughout the 21st century. In November 2018, it was announced a reboot was in development, with the first part of a four-part game to be released in September 2020.
Plot and Gameplay.
The series consists of point and click adventures, requiring players to interact with an inventory and with characters in order to complete puzzles and advance the story. The main character is intended to be a caricature of the arrogant Israeli, with a worldview that "the whole world is an idiot – and that talk can not be done quietly, only with shouting".
The plot of "Piposh" follows the quirky adventures of its main character, flawed actor Hezi Piposh and "morbidly tactless guy in his attempts to reach Hollywood and make it big". In the first game, he boards the wrong boat and has numerous antics, including being caught up in a murder. He can interrogate characters, break into their rooms, and accuse them of murder. In "Piposh 2," Piposh finds himself trapped on an island populated by dwarves, who help him assemble an aviation device to escape. "Halom SheItgashem" is focused on eight strange acquaintances who are invited to the castle of an eccentric man. "Piposh 3D" revolves around a political revolution that ensues because the entire country decides to become vegetarian, replacing meat with tofu.
History.
Conception and "In the Interest of Ratings" (1997–98).
In the late 1980 while Ronan Gluzman was at the age of 13, he began his computer gaming career by creating games and animations on Macromedia Mac Director software. After he left the Israeli army and while his brother Roy was still a member, they set up a small graphics business in Pardes Hanna (פרדס חנה), where they did routine projects for commission. In 1997, one of their projects reached the desk of the CEO of video game distributor Hed Artzi Multimedia (הד ארצי מולטימדיה), the multimedia arm of Israeli record label Hed Arzi Music, who liked the illustration style of the duo and suggested they create a Hebrew-language computer game. He gave them NIS 10,000 in return for 50% of the future profits from the sales.
Despite having no experience in the video gaming industry, the team went to work and after nine months of development, released "In the Interest of Ratings (בתככי הרייטינג)", a title which focused on the incompetent detective Elimelech Egoz (voiced by Moshe Ferster), who goes on holiday at the fictional Nofei Hadera Hotel only to be greeted by a bizarre murder case. The game contained intertextuality, inside jokes, irony, and cynicism. "In the Interest of Ratings" received negative reviews in the press, including in "Internet Captain (קפטן האינטרנט"), the technology/multimedia branch of the leading Israeli newspaper "Haaretz"; however it received positive reviews in youth-oriented newspapers. Ultimately the game was relatively popular, though it was not financially successful. But it led the duo to decide to try to develop a second video game, which would become "Piposh", under their new development company Guillotine (גיליוטין).
"Piposh" (1998–99).
The Gluzman brothers wrote the text and the code, drew the backgrounds and characters, and created the animations; in addition they convinced actors Shai Avivi, Amos Shuv, Anat Magen, Ilan Peled, Dudu Zar, Meni Pe'er, and Ilan Ganani (as Piposh) to voice characters voluntarily. The game was developed by four people in a garage, at a time when the computer gaming industry in Israel was considered practically non-existent. Glutzman recalls that Guillotine was not particularly well managed, lacked business planning and didn't have a financial focus, and instead consisted of a naive team who wanted to simply make something "fun and cool". "Ynet" asserts the duo was irrational for choosing set up a development company for Israeli games that only appealed to the local market. Ronen would later describe the contemporary Israeli video gaming industry as an imaginary thing to pursue, for four young developers working from their garage. During development, Ronan used the program "Macromedia Director 4", and he created each game screens from scratch. At the time of the game's release, Ronan published his phone number to allow stuck players to phone in for help.
After a year and a half of development, "Piposh" was released; it became a hit among teenagers and sold 6000 copies over a period of one year in retail sales, and would ultimately sell or over 7000 copies. They achieved this without reducing the original selling price. "Haaretz" asserts that many thousands more probably illegally pirated it. The game reached 5th place on the sales charts, and for a few weeks was competitive with the best-selling games from abroad. Some of Piposh's royalties were donated to the animal rights and welfare organizations. The game originally had text and voice-work in Hebrew, though a few years later it was made available in both English and Russian, and due to its success Guillotine was able to distribute the games to the United States and Russia. Due to the title's low minimum requirements, it was able to be played on computers with weaker processing power. The game was deemed an adventure gaming success aimed primarily at the local market, having been developed independently, almost underground. While not officially a Piposh title, "In the Interest of Ratings" has a link to the series; within "Piposh", the main character – a flawed actor – claims to have played Egoz in the previous game.
Rest of the series (2000–04).
Roy left the series during production of the second game, believing that in addition to piracy, the distribution networks weren't as efficient at bringing video games to stores as other products like Israeli music. According to Ronan, his brother did not have prowess in the business and marketing side to succeed in the industry. After leaving, Roy moved away from sensationalist nature of the entertainment and gaming industry, and instead focused in personal creative projects. On his own Ronan began to suffer financially, which would continue for years while making the Piposh games. By 2003 he was living on 30 shekels a day. He would later explain that at the time, to be a video game developer in Israel, one was expected not to make money. While the first game took 1.5 years to make, the team spent a year making Piposh 2, and a year making "Halom SheItgashem". Each time the developers made a game, they did it independently and without external funding. Once a title neared completion, Guillotine spoke to their distribution company to print discs and send them to stores. However, as the distribution company was very large they didn't have time to invest into a small local game like "Piposh" so the games ended up being sent out two weeks later than intended, once the advertising and buzz had died down. For each title, Ronan produced advertising materials such as posters, business cards and funny stickers.
"Piposh 3D" was the series' first foray into 3D graphics, after using traditional animation for the previous games; this title was directed by Roy Lazarowitz. By this point the developers had grown tired of their distributor and sought to use Indogram, which represented fewer games and could therefore invest more time into each. It was developed using the A5 engine, which Guillotine had purchased specifically for this title. 2004 saw the English release of "Piposh" entitled "Piposh Holywood", which was to be published by The Phantom after Phantom Entertainment bought the distribution rights electronically. "Ynet" noted that if successful, it would have been a notable achievement for the industry, seeing the first Israeli video game released on console, but noting the unclear outcome of this venture. Guillotine had aimed to translate their first Piposh game to break it into the international market, however the text and dubbing translations became an astronomical task due to the original game having a badly-constructed programming interface. The foreign adaption of the first game is known worldwide by its English title. The games were not intended to meet the technological standards of the global industry, particularly in terms of graphics. They were not targeted at a worldwide audience, instead appealing to Israeli teenagers who were not necessarily gamers, but who wanted immature content with cultural references they would understand. "Haaretz" contends that despite the development team tapping into the minds of local youth, the rampant pirate copying phenomenon prevented them from making a living of their games.
"Piposh" saw numerous opportunities for franchise expansion over its history. The team gave up a NIS 20,000 offer by Burger Ranch to distribute the games because they were vegetarians. Soon after the release of Piposh, the duo started creating a weekly comic section in the local youth newspapers Rosh 1 and Maariv LeYanar, and also created a comic book which was published by Hed Artzi, released under the title "Piposh and Other Vegetables" (פיפוש ושאר ירקות), which could be purchased from the official Guillotine site. They also lectured to youth at an animation and comics festival at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. In 2000, the developers thought of porting Piposh to mobile phones, having already set up documents such as an instillation guide; however this never came to fruition. A spin-off television series named Batheshet Moav (בטשת מואב) – ten episodes in length and about five minutes per episode – first aired on the Beep channel in either 2001 or February 5, 2002. A previous concept for the show – where viewers could interact by choosing which of two outcomes they wanted to watch – was offered to Fox Kids. While Fox wanted to sign a contract, Guillotine refused as they did not want to give up the rights and the artistic freedom, for instance they would be censored from using the swear word קיבינימט and from mentioning that Piposh's father drowned in the Yarkon River. An album featuring music, interviews, and other content entitled "At the Piposh Tavern" was released by Guillotine and the Tag Group in 2004. A fourth game (excluding the spinoff) was to be released but this was eventually cancelled. Running until at least 2004, 'Piposh Congresses' have been held as national meeting for all the fans of Piposh and Guillotine. The developers sold an "I'm Pipposi Proud" game package, which included 5 game discs including the first three titles, plus a demo of Piposh 3D and a disc with rare files and documents.
Aftermath (2005–17).
The last title developed by Guillotine was the network-strategy nonsense game Vajimon, which saw players fight against each other over the internet using a variety of vegetables. Around 2003–4, the company's operations were terminated and its managers retired. Ronen left the industry soon after due to the financial and mental burden the series had given him, and became a yacht skipper. He earned money as a writer of games for interactive TV and cell phone in a leading high tech company. In 2005, the brothers lectured for a Gameology course at Beit Berl College as part of the first Israeli curriculum course for video game development. The program was started by Dr. Diana Silverman Keller who discovered while writing her thesis that there was no formal education in the field of game creation in the country. She noted that "Despite the success of Israeli high-tech, the Israelis do not excel at developing games". Keller contacted Ronan, who at the time was known as the "spiritual father of the Israeli gaming community", and he soon became a central figure in the program.
On May 7, 2008, on Israel's 60th Independence Day, all Guillotine games were re-released free to download on the Internet. By this time, it was impossible to get the games anymore, as there were no orderly backups. Ronan Gluzman noted that the games were unplayable unless the player had a Windows 95 computer, and commented "I felt that I had to do this, in order to save the game from falling into the abyss". Tal Dinovich, a fan of the series who had volunteered for years on the site and answered phone calls from stuck players, helped locate all the game files and create updated versions that would work on Windows XP. Ronan noted it was strange to revisit these games after having not touched them since the series ended in 2003. While he had since moved on from the series, Ronen did create a Facebook group for the fans who had grown up with the series and wanted to reminisce. According to Calcalist, the series released 7 games, 4 of which are available for free download. As part of the campaign, Ronen aimed to print special nostalgic shirts, as this was a common fan request.
In December 2008, a group of Piposh fans, believing that it had died prematurely, started a campaign to create a new chapter of the series and started looking for volunteers. The game, to be developed through their company Sellotape (סלוטייפ) was entitled "Piposh 2.5 and the Stolen Vase". The official website of the project wrote that while the developers were unable to reach the quality level of the official games, they hoped to emulate it as much as possible. Their aim was to "remember, save, and enjoy" the Piposh series. The plot, taking place immediately after Piposh 2, saw the protagonist try to find the magic 'vase of life' that can be used to resurrect characters that died in the prequel. The producer/director was Ben Werchizer, the artist/designer was Daniel Avdo, the music and dubbing producer was Itay Jeroffi, and the writer was Shahar Kraus; they were looking for professional programmers in Director or Flash as well as voice talent. Their site contained a "build your own character" minigame from the series as a flash game, and a forum dedicated to the resurrection of Piposh. The project was discontinued around 2010.
Video game archivist and founder of the "Movement for Preservation of Games in Israel" Raphael Ben-Ari got in touch with the series' creators and detailed the story behind its development process and in a documentary film. The documentary was uploaded to YouTube on Ben-Ari's "Oldschool" account. Ben-Ari believes the work boosted the Piposh community in Israel and introduced the series to many new people.
In 2015, Renard was given the "Half Life" award at the 2015 GameIS Awards.due to his work on the series having a "significant impact on the short history of the Israeli gaming industry", thereby helping it to flourish.
During this time, Piposh was surrounded by a loyal fanbase who held onto the franchise even while no games were in active development. Writing a game quote in one of the Piposh Facebook groups would be met with relevant written responses and memes, and links to legally download the games. Over the years, the large community of fans who love and reminisce over the series "ran Facebook groups, organized events and constantly asked for a new game".
Comeback (2018–Present).
In 2018, Piposh creators announced they would produce a reboot of the game, due for release in September 2019.
State of Israeli industry.
Despite having a weak presence overall, the Israeli video gaming industry was at its peak in the 1990s, with several companies creating games, developing engines, and trying to become successful both at home and abroad. One example is (מחשבת), which began as an importer and translator of games to the Israeli market. In the mid-1990s, the company would create children's video games based on popular legends and fairytales called 'CD F'doph' (סי.די פדוף"). Created during the golden age of the point and click adventure games, two of Machshevet's popular titles are: ' (שליט המימדים: מסע ההרפתקאות המופלא) (1996) and "Armed &amp; Delirious" (1997). Compedia (קומפדיה), while primarily a technologies, platforms and systems developer, also created educational computer games which were distributed to over 40 countries, including the "Advanced Thinking Skills" series (1992–93), the "Timmy" series (1994–95), the "Gordy" series (סדרת גורדי), the "Itamar" series (סדרת איתמר), "Gordy in the Movie Adventure" (גורדי בהרפתקה מהסרטים), "In Search of the Lost Words" (בעקבות המילים האבודות 1996/1998), and "Julia: Back to the Sweet 60's" (2001). Other notable Israeli video games of the time include: "Xonix" (1984), "Intifada" (אינתיפאדה 1989), and (סוחר הים 1989), "Bonus" (בונוס), "Avish" (אביש 1993), "Duvalle" (דובל'ה 1993-1997), ' (1998), and "You Think You're Smart" (אתה חושב שאתה חכם 1998-2001). Throughout the 1990s, Israeli developers also created various "silly little games...to promote children's food products" such as Vered Hagalil and Bamba.
Factor believed that while the 80s and 90s saw the serious development of games within Israel, with the country being at the peak of its video gaming industry, it was still defined by a level of inferiority on the world stage, which had only started to improve in the early 2010s with social and casual gaming apps. Makorrishon wrote that Piposh was created at a time when it was generally accepted that to make good games one had to work abroad in a large company. Video game developer Adiel Gur thinks that Guillotine's did not have many contemporaries because of a lack of interest from high-tech companies to make games, a belief from producers that the sector is unprofitable, a lack of resources and tools for developers to make professional games, and the difficulty in amassing a team of workers from different fields (graphic artists, programmers, scriptwriters etc.). Ynet wrote that considering the number of Israelis studying computer science and the reputation of the country as a hub for high-tech entrepreneurs, it was surprising "how much an Israeli gaming industry does not exist", describing it as a "local vacuum". Roy explained that in his opinion: "People who have the ability to develop computer games prefer to develop navigation applications and worm software that will sabotage the reactor in Iran". In one case, the developers of Ballerium (2001) had to first present a comprehensive business plan in order to lure potential investors.
In 2001, Ynet wrote that it was difficult to name Israeli games that were not children's edutainment, and though able to recall some popular titles, with exception to "Jane's IAF: Israeli Air Force" called them "negligible in terms of scope and technicality" and non-competitive in the global market. In 2008, the site asserted that until recently, apart from children's edutainment developer and the Piposh series, there was no video gaming industry in Israel, though expressed hope that the action game "Rising Eagle" would change that. Meanwhile, in 2008 Eser wrote: "It's not that I think there is no future for the Israeli computer games industry, and that there is no need to nurture it".
Critical reception.
The games became a cult hit in Israel, known for their unique humor, original characters and a satirical look at Israeli society. Ronen is notable for being one of a few Israelis who have managed to develop a computer game within the country and distribute it in Israel. According to "Timeout", the games are hilarious and brave. "Eser" felt that Piposh was a "semi-decent adventure game". Bikorate felt the title had a "fascinating plot and humor ahead of its time". The student newsletter Factor thought the game was "more funny, more ingenious, and generally more universal" than "In the Interest of Ratings" had been a year earlier, and felt the two games were "exemplary examples of Israeli creativity". "Sport5" listed the game in their article "There is honor: the greatest Israeli computer games ever", rating it 10/10 and praising its unique crazy and sharp sense of creativity and humour, as well as for sparking one of the "most cohesive computer game communities ever in the country".
"Haaretz" deemed it ultimately a failed initiative to establish the Israeli video gaming industry, despite its significance. Vgames deemed the series "the most daring attempt to create computer games for Israeli audiences only". In 2001, "Ynet" asserted that the few games of Israeli origin such as Piposh were "quite negligible in terms of scope and technicality", and were "not close to being competitive in the global market", however in 2003 the site saw the series as a source of Israeli pride. The site would later come to feel that the series offered some of the most "bizarre, funny and hallucinatory quests" to come out of gaming, noting that the first title is widely regarded as a cult game, and that many peculiar moments from the series are etched into the minds of players. Bikorate thought Piposh 2 surprised with its "witty and satirical jokes about Israeli society".
The Hebrew site "Eser," despite having sympathy for Israeli game developers, who are "forced to work in almost impossible conditions" when compared to their American and European colleagues, gave Piposh 3D a scathing review; while calling its premise amusing, and noting that the patient "Piposh" fanbase would overlook its inferior graphics the site felt the game was very bad, likening it to a "singer singing without makeup". "Ynet" criticised 3D's graphics and interface, though noted its humour and charm might make up for the experience. Ben-Ari feels a sense of patriotism toward the game as a piece of video gaming software that is proudly and unabashedly Israeli. Factor thought the series attempt to enter the 3D market was an "utter failure". Even though Walla thought Piposh 3D was a bad game, it thought the game looked like a masterpiece in comparison with "Dangerous Vaults", a Lara Croft parody that forces players to have sex with animals.
When news of a fan-made Piposh 2.5 was brought to Nana 10, the site made an emotional appeal to its readers, hoping to attract anyone who could "help this promising project take shape", while hoping it would be the first of many. Meanwhile, 2all.co.il wished the developers success.
Noting a recent campaign to name a road in Israel "Lara Croft street", Nana 10 hoped that soon there would be a "Piposh street" to honour the series. The paper believed Piposh to the possibly the most successful and profitable Israeli computer gaming project, deeming Guillotine a champion of the local industry. Makorrishon deemed Guillotine a "stubborn pioneer" due to persisting with making a game in Israel, though noted that despite their bravery, the company did close down a mere 6 years later. Looking back at the games in 2008, Ronen was impressed at how the humour held up, and noted ultimately that Piposh is "not a game of technology, but of people, behavior and relationships". Comedy Children listed the original title as the only Israeli entry in an article entitled "The Most Funny Games".
According to Gadgety, the games have "earned cult status among Israeli players". Calcalist deemed it "most important series of games - well, the only one - that was done in Israel in this millennium". Additionally, it argued that the series' humor that combined the nonsense of LucasArts and Sierra with the experimental weirdness of Channel 2. Ronen has said that "What "Piposh" is good at is being crazy, being delusional and telling a good story with an emphasis on humor and Israeliness".

Polish Athletics Championships

The Polish Athletics Championships () is an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Polish Athletic Association (PZLA), which serves as the Polish national championship for the sport. It is typically held as a three-day event in the Polish summer, ranging from late June to early August. The venue of the championships changes annually.
Following the establishment of the PZLA in 1919, the national championships was first held in 1920 as a men-only event. The first two championships were held in Lviv (now in Ukraine) as this city was the headquarters of the national sports body and home to the only modern athletics stadium in the country. Women's events were included shortly after in 1922. The women's championships were contested separately from the men's from 1925 to 1949 (1945–46 excepted). The championships has been contested every year since its inception, bar a brief period from 1940 to 1944 when World War II led to abandonment of the competition.
Events.
The current track and field programme features a total of 40 individual Polish Championship athletics events, divided evenly between the sexes.
The competition has featured more unusual events, such as the grenade throw for men in 1951 and both men and women in 1952. Men competed in the standing long jump at the 1920 and 1921 editions. This event had a longer history in the women's programme, lasting from 1927 to 1947. A men's 200 metres hurdles was first contested in1 1953 but stopped after 1963. Women contested that event in 1970 and 1971. A few events were unique to women, including the 60 metres (held from 1922 to 1950), a 250 m (1924 to 1926), a 1000 m in 1926 and 1927, and a 500 m from 1949 to 1951.
The women's programme expanded inline with international acceptance of women's athletics. The women's 1500 metres was added in 1969 and the 400 m hurdles followed the year after. The women's 3000 metres was introduced in 1973 and contested up to 1994. The women's equivalents of the men's standard 5000 m and 10,000 m were added in 1984. The 80 metres hurdles was combined with the 100 metres hurdles at the 1968 championships, before the longer distance replaced it the following year. Later additions to the women's programme were triple jump (1991), pole vault and hammer throw (1995) and the steeplechase (1999).
Championship events are held at different locations for combined track and field events, road running and walks, and cross country running.

Sandra Božić

Sandra Božić (; born 15 October 1979) is a Serbian politician who has been serving as a member of the National Assembly of Serbia since 2018 and as the deputy leader of the "For Our Children" parliamentary group since 2020.
Early life and private career.
Božić was born in Pančevo, Vojvodina, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She holds a degree in political science and was the head of the public utility "Grejanje" from 2015 to 2018.
Political career.
Božić received the 186th position on the Progressive Party's "Aleksandar Vučić — Future We Believe In" electoral list in the 2014 parliamentary election. The list won a majority victory with 158 out of 250 seats; Božić was not elected and did not serve in assembly that followed. She received the 144th position on the successor "Aleksandar Vučić — Future We Believe In" electoral list in the 2016 election. The list won 131 mandates and she was once again not immediately elected; she was, however, awarded a mandate on 6 March 2018, as a replacement for Vesna Rakonjac.
During the 2016–20 parliament, Božić was a member of the assembly committee on the rights of the child and the committee on labour, social issues, social inclusion, and poverty reduction; a deputy member of the defence and internal affairs committee, the health and family committee, and the committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues; a substitute member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Dimension of the Central European Initiative; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Austria, Azerbaijan, China, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, and the United States of America.
Božić and fellow Progressive Party parliamentarian Aleksandar Martinović went on a two-day hunger strike in May 2020, to protest the inaction of Serbia's prosecution and judiciary against what they described as the violent behaviour of Dveri leader Boško Obradović. The strike ended after President Vučić urged the parliamentarians to call it off.
She was promoted to the seventeenth position on the Progressive Party's "Aleksandar Vučić — For Our Children" list for the 2020 Serbian parliamentary election and was elected to a second term when the list won a landslide victory with 188 mandates. After the election, she was chosen as deputy leader of the "Aleksandar Vučić — For Our Children" parliamentary group. She is also the chair of the culture and information committee; a full member of the committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues; a deputy member of the security services control committee; a member of the European Union–Serbia stabilization and association committee; the leader of Serbia's parliamentary friendship group with the United Kingdom; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America.

Blue Ball Church

Blue Ball Church, in Hardin County, Kentucky near Howe Valley, was built in 1849. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It is also known as Blueball Baptist Church or Blue Ball Baptist Church.
It is a one-story gable-front brick church, with brick laid in common bond, on a limestone foundation. A two-story frame addition extended the building to the rear in c.1950. A two-story annex, also to the rear, was built by 2008.
The church was deemed "a notable example of an ante-bellum gable front church. The church is the only ante-bellum brick church located in the county outside of Elizabethtown and is a good example of an early brick church constructed by congregations in the early to mid-19th century. The building retains its original entrance, windows and brick detailing."

Longing (Bell Witch album)

Longing is the debut studio album by the Seattle-based doom metal band Bell Witch, released on November 13, 2012 through Profound Lore Records. The album began Bell Witch's trend of slow, low, and mournful music for which the band would become known.
Critical reception.
"Longing" was met with generally positive reviews. Andy O'Connor of "Pitchfork" magazine praised the album's haunting, melancholic nature, and highlighted the vocals as particularly effective in evoking a bleak atmosphere. Writing for "PopMatters", Craig Hayes said, ""Longing" highlights just how far we can sink into mires of hopelessness, and the bittersweet beauty we find in such despair. Bell Witch strikes a superb balance between the vulnerability of painful remembrances and stentorian roars of sorrow." "Metal Injection"'s Cody Davis wrote, "Desmond and Guerra exchange vocals that mix between ghostly bellows and Gregorian-esque clean vocals throughout Longing in addition to bringing utterly leveling bass guitar and drums that flip the script on what qualifies to make heavy Doom Metal." In MetalSucks' more lukewarm review of "Longing", the album was lauded for its mood and slow pace, but was also recognized as difficult to approach and deliberately hard to listen to.
Music.
The fourth track, "Beneath the Mask", features a section of dialogue from the film "The Masque of the Red Death".

Washington City Paper describes the label as "a creative collective where like-minded musicians move fluidly between each other’s projects," even as such projects retain their own distinct identities.
Electronic elements are explored throughout a number of the label's releases. Examinations of identity, politics, gender and sexuality can also be found frequently across albums.
Format.
BLIGHT. Records primarily utilizes the cassette tape format for its releases.

Rae Linda Brown

Rae Linda Brown (October 7, 1953 – August 20, 2017) was an American musicologist.
As a scholar, archivist and editor Rae Linda Brown conducted research on topics in American classical music, Black Music and African-American classical music. Brown authored books and academic treatises on Florence Price and William Grant Still. As a professor and administrator Brown led in the creation of new academic programs at the University of California, Irvine, Loyola Marymount University, and Pacific Lutheran University.
Brown grew up in Hartford Connecticut and earned degrees at the University of Connecticut and Yale University. Some of Brown's graduate work at Yale catalogued sheet music and scores in the James Weldon Johnson memorial collection at the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library and comprises Volume 23 of the Garland Critical Studies on Black Life and Culture.
Brown's 1987 dissertation focused on composer Florence Price. Throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s Brown rediscovered, edited, and published critical analyses of Florence Price's music. Brown's work in this area became the basis for a wider recognition of Price's role in and contribution to American music. This recognition contributed to the discovery of previously unknown scores that are now housed at the University of Arkansas.
Brown was a Professor at University of Michigan and The University of California, Irvine. While at Irvine, Brown served as the Robert and Marjorie Rawlins Chair of the Department of Music, oversaw completion of a new building for the department, the development of new academic programs in jazz, and the creation of a doctoral program in Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology. From 2008-2015 Brown was the Vice President for Undergraduate Education at Loyola Marymount University; from 2016 until her death Brown was the Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs at Pacific Lutheran University. In 2017 Brown received the inaugural Willis C. Patterson Research Award for her work in the area of African-American Art Song.

Barry Festoff

Barry Festoff is a board-certified neurologist, Professor of Neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center and the founder of pHLOGISTIX, a neurodiagnostic and therapeutic biotech company.
Early life.
Barry Festoff grew up in South Florida and attended the University of Florida at Gainesville. He then attended and completed his medical degree at the University of Miami. Inspired by research in neurologic diseases, he interned at the Duke University Hospital and was accepted into the Research Training Program in Molecular Biology at Duke University Medical School. He then spent two years in a Neurology residency at University of Miami - Jackson Memorial Hospital. Barry is married to Kansas City artist, Shea Gordon.
Career.
During the Vietnam War era, he spent his military requirement doing research at the Medical Neurology Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness in Bethesda, Maryland. At NIH he established a new laboratory, the Muscle Membrane Biochemistry Laboratory, branching into novel state-of-the-art research in the field. In 1976, he was recruited to the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) to establish a clinical neurology service and the Neurobiology Research Laboratory at the Kansas City VA Medical Center. During the course of 35 years researching, he was awarded the Medical Investigator Research Award and won other awards. During that time he was inducted into the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the American Neurological Association, and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He has published more 200 scientific articles and edited three books. He retired from the VA in 2010 and founded pHLOGISTIX, a neurodiagnostic and therapeutic biotech company, while still a professor at KUMC.
pHLOGISTIX.
Dr. Festoff's career has involved translational research into neurologic diseases, especially the relationship between neurotrauma and its evolution to neurodegeneration. His lifetime of research has led to the founding of pHLOGISTIX, a company that focuses on blood-based biomarkers as companion diagnostics for neurotrauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in order to harness neuroinflammation and improve functional outcomes following trauma to the central nervous system (CNS). The ultimate goal is to provide a validated panel of nucleic acid and protein biomarkers in a novel analytic approach to allow the identification of patients with CTE and AD before symptoms develop, i.e., preclinical, while still at the stage of mild cognitive impairment, especially after early detection of concussions.

<doc id="56916827" url="?curid=56916827" title="Anglican Chapel of Salvador">
Anglican Chapel of Salvador

The Anglican Chapel of Salvador was an Anglican temple located in Salvador, capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia. First subject to the Church of England and then to the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, the chapel was demolished in 1975 to give place to the Britânia Mansion residential building.
History.
Anglicanism first arrived in Brazil in the early 19th century in the context of the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil. In 1810 Portugal and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which permitted the construction of Anglican chapels in Brazil, as long as they did not resemble religious temples and did not seek the conversion of Brazilians. That same year, the first Anglican services in the country took place – in English and aimed exclusively at foreigners. The Anglican chaplaincy of Salvador was established in 1815 and its services were initially held in private residences.
In 1811 Marcos de Noronha e Brito, then Governor of Bahia, authorized the construction of the British Cemetery in the Barra slope. An Anglican chapel – known as Saint George's Church or British Church – was inaugurated there for the burial ceremonies of Anglo-Brazilians and people from other nationalities. After the Independence, then chaplain Edward Parker bought a piece of land near the Campo Grande square for the construction of a religious temple for the Anglican community of Salvador. The Anglican Chapel was opened in October 1853 by the Saint George Society. As it already occurred in Rio de Janeiro, the local British community referred to the temple as "Christ Church". At the same time, the local government was finishing its urbanization works in the Campo Grande square, which would be used by the British for their cricket matches.
The Anglican Chapel of Salvador was modelled after the classical architecture and it was the second largest non-Roman Catholic temple built in Brazil. During the Empire, Catholicism remained as the state religion of the country and non-Catholic churches were still forbidden to resemble churches, with towers and bells. It was only after the Proclamation of the Republic – when Brazil was transformed into a secular state – that this obligation ceased to exist and Anglicans could finally held their services in Portuguese and seek out to convert Brazilians. That prompted the Episcopal Church to create the missionary district of Brazil, which would originate the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil after the merge of the British chaplaincies and the American missions in the mid-20th century.
In 1975, with the increase of real estate speculation in the area surrounding the Campo Grande square, a construction company negotiated with the Saint George Society the exchange of the site of the chapel for the construction of a new temple in Pituba. Therefore, the chapel was demolished that year, giving place to the Britânia Mansion residential building. The following year, the Saint George Society was no longer responsible for organizing the Anglican church in Salvador; that prerogative was given to the Anglican Parish of the Good Shepherd. In 2010 the parish transferred its headquarters to a new temple located in the Bonfim neighbourhood, while keeping its church in Pituba. That same year, the parish was legally separated from the Saint George Society, which became a non-profit organization with no direct link to the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, responsible only for the maintenance of the British Cemetery.

George and Joanne Urioste

Joanne Urioste (born c. 1952) and George Urioste (born c. 1937) are American rock climbers, who made over a hundred first ascents, in Red Rock Canyon.
George Urioste, also known as Jorge Urioste, was born in Chile, to a Bolivian father, and holds citizenship in both countries. Jorge became a Jesuit priest, and moved to the United States to study at Cornell University. There he met and started climbing with Joanne. Joanne grew up in Brooklyn and worked on her bachelor's degree in life science at Cornell, while George was working on his PhD. In 1974, having just finished their studies, they married and moved to Las Vegas, where George began teaching anthropology and linguistics at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
In the next decade, they established over a hundred new routes, many of which, such as "Crimson Chrysalis", "Epinephrine", "Dream of Wild Turkeys" and "Levitation 29" are now some of Red Rock's most famous and popular climbs. The popularity of Urioste routes stems from the fact that most are long multi-pitch routes, following striking lines, and which were made relatively safe by placing bolts in blank sections. That resulted in some climbs which were strongly opposed by some local climbers at the time (mid 1970s to mid 1980s), who emphasized bolt-free boldness in their ascents. In 1984 Joanne wrote a climbing guide book, called "The Red Rocks of Southern Nevada" and in 1986, after the arrival of their children, they retired from climbing for ten years, during which Joanne took up ultra distance running, especially through wilderness and mountains, having completed six one hundred mile races, as well as 165 miles on the John Muir Trail (Whitney Portal to Red's Meadow; in 1996) in five days flat, solo, and self supported. After their ten-year retirement from climbing, they returned and are continuing to establish a number of significant routes in Red Rock, some of which are 1500 to 2400 feet long ("Inti Watana, Gift of the Wind Gods, Woman of Mountain Dreams, Twixt Cradle and Stone, "and" Slim").

Alireza Firouzja

Alireza Firouzja (, ; born 18 June 2003) is an Iranian-French chess player. He won the Iranian Chess Championship at the age of 12 and earned the Grandmaster title at the age of 14. He is the second-youngest player ever to reach a rating of 2700 (after Wei Yi), at the age of 16 years and 1 month. By his eighteenth birthday in June 2021 he was rated 2759 and ranked 13th in the world.
In December 2019, he announced that he would no longer play under the Iranian flag after Iran withdrew its players from the 2019 World Rapid and Blitz Championship to uphold their ban against Iranians playing against Israelis. Since 2019, he has been based in France, and he has been playing under the French flag since 2021.
Early life.
Firouzja was born on 18 June 2003 in Babol. He started playing chess at the age of eight. In 2019, Firouzja and his father left Iran and moved to France. He applied for and obtained French nationality in July 2021.
Chess career.
Firouzja won the gold medal in the U12 section at the Asian Youth Chess Championships in 2015. At the age of twelve, he won the 2016 Iranian Chess Championship, scoring 8/11 points (+5−0=6), a full point ahead of his nearest competitors, and became the youngest ever to win the title. Also in 2016, he was awarded the title International Master (IM) by FIDE.
2018.
In February 2018, he participated in the Aeroflot Open. He finished 40th out of 92, scoring 4½/9 points (+2−2=5), earning his final norm required for the title Grandmaster (GM) in the process. He was awarded the GM title by FIDE in April 2018. From 26 July to 4 August, Firouzja represented Iran at the Asian Nations Cup, held in Hamadan. Iran won all three open events, and Firouzja was the top individual performer in the classical event with 6/7. At the 43rd Chess Olympiad, he played on fourth board, scoring 8/11 (+6−1=4). He won individual gold at the World Youth U16 Chess Olympiad, held from 25 November to 2 December, with a score of 8/9 points (+7−0=2; 2736 ).
At the 2018 World Rapid Championship held in Saint Petersburg, Firouzja finished sixth in a field of world-class players, behind Daniil Dubov, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, Hikaru Nakamura, Vladislav Artemiev and Magnus Carlsen. Starting as the 169th seed in a tournament of 206 participants, Firouzja scored 10/15 (+8−3=4) and a performance rating of 2848, the second-highest in the event behind the winner Dubov. At the World Blitz Championship, he placed 42nd out of 150 with a score of 12/21 (+10−7=4). He led the field by a clear point after 7 rounds with 6½/7, but his form faltered after losing to the eventual winner Carlsen in round 8.
2019.
Firouzja won the Iranian Chess Championship for a second time in 2019, finishing clear first with 9/11 (+7−0=4). In March, he competed in the World Team Chess Championship with Iran. He scored 7/9 points (+6−1=2) as Iran placed sixth out of ten. Later in March, he participated in the 3rd Sharjah Masters. He tied for 1st–7th on 7/9 (+5−0=4), placing fourth on tiebreak. Ernesto Inarkiev won the event. In April, Firouzja competed in the Chess.com Bullet Chess Championship, losing in the quarterfinals to the eventual winner Hikaru Nakamura. Later in April, Firouzja placed second on tiebreak behind Constantin Lupulescu in the Reykjavik Open with 7/9 (+6−1=2). During the event's rest day, he won the European Fischer Random Championship with 8/9 (+7−0=2).
Firouzja competed in the Grenke Chess Open, held from April 18-22. He won his first two games but refused to play against the Israeli FIDE Master Or Bronstein in the third round, thus forfeiting the game. This was in line with Iranian government policy, as Iran does not recognise the state of Israel and sanctions players who compete against Israelis. Firouzja then lost in the fourth round to 1945-rated Antonia Ziegenfuss. He won his remaining five games to place 27th with 7/9. In May, Firouzja faced Peruvian grandmaster José Martinez-Alcantara in round one of the 2019 Junior Speed Chess Championship, an online blitz and bullet competition hosted by Chess.com. Firouzja won the match with an overall score of 18–7. Later in May, he competed in the French Rapid and Blitz Championships, held in Le Blanc-Mesnil. He won the rapid event by defeating Alberto David in the final.
In June, Firouzja took part in the 18th edition of the Asian Chess Championship, held from 6 to 16 June in Xingtai. He finished the tournament in sixth place with 6/9 points (+5−2=2). Though only the top five were set to qualify for the Chess World Cup 2019, Firouzja narrowly qualified for a spot in the World Cup as 1st-placed Le Quang Liem and 5th-placed Rinat Jumabayev had already qualified in previous events. He later finished fourth in a Blitz event held in the final day of the tournament with 6½/9 pts (+6−2=1).
Firouzja represented Tatvan in the Turkish Super League from 17 to 28 July. He scored 11½/13 (+10–0=3), thus increasing his rating to 2702. This made Firouzja the first Iranian to reach a rating of 2700 or above. It also made him the youngest player in the world rated 2700 or over, and the second youngest player in history (after Wei Yi) to achieve that feat.
At the FIDE World Cup in September, Firouzja defeated Arman Pashikian and Daniil Dubov in rounds one and two, respectively. This made Firouzja the first Iranian player to reach the third round of a Chess World Cup. In round three, he faced the number-one seed Ding Liren. Firouzja drew with Ding in the two classical games, but lost both of the rapid tiebreakers and was eliminated from the tournament.
On 27 December, Firouzja announced that he would no longer play under the Iran chess federation after Iran withdrew its players from the 2019 World Rapid and Blitz Championship to uphold their ban against Iranians playing against Israelis. He instead competed as a FIDE-licensed competitor. Firouzja competed in the World Rapid Chess Championship from 26 to 28 December. He finished the tournament as runner-up with 10½/15 (+8–2=5), one point short of the winner Carlsen. He is the first-ever Iranian-born grandmaster to be able to go on a podium in the history of this competition. At the World Blitz Chess Championship held from 29 to 30 December, Firouzja placed sixth with 13½/21 (+12–6=3).
2020.
Firouzja participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in January. He became the first Iranian to compete in the Masters' bracket of the tournament; Parham Maghsoodloo had previously competed in the 2019 Tata Steel Challengers. This was the first time that Firouzja faced the world elite in a classical round-robin tournament, and he said in an interview that his expectations were not oriented towards winning the event, but gaining more experience at the top level. He finished with 6½/13 (+4–4=5), placing ninth.
In February, Firouzja competed in the Masters section of the Prague International Chess Festival, a 10-player category XIX round-robin event, as a late replacement for Wei Yi, who could not attend due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After a tie for first–fifth on 5/9, Firouzja won the tournament following a 2–0 tiebreak victory over Vidit Gujrathi, thus improving on his previous result at TATA Steel and becoming one of the youngest players to ever attain a supertournament victory.
On 15 April, Firouzja faced Magnus Carlsen in the final of the Chess24 Banter Blitz Cup and won 8½–7½. Firouzja then competed in the Magnus Carlsen Invitational, a rapid tournament held by Chess24 from 18 April to 3 May, along with Carlsen and six other top players. Carlsen defeated Firouzja in their match by a score of 2½–1½. Firouzja placed sixth overall and did not advance to the four-way playoff.
In October, Firouzja participated in the annual Norway Chess supertournament held in Stavanger. Participants in the tournament included World Champion Magnus Carlsen, world number 2 Fabiano Caruana, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, Levon Aronian and Norwegian player Aryan Tari. Like in the previous edition, the tournament was held with a football scoring system (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss). In case of a draw, games were decided in an armageddon playoff where a victory would provide an additional 1/2 point.
Firouzja finished with 2nd place (18.5), 1 point behind Carlsen (19.5) and ahead of Aronian, Caruana and Duda. By the standard scoring method, Firouzja's score of 4 victories, 1 loss and 5 draws would have been enough to tie for 1st place, but Carlsen's extra points from wins in the armageddon segment relegated Firouzja to second place. His for the event was 2880.
2021.
Firouzja participated in the 83rd Tata Steel Masters in January. Going into the final round of the tournament, Firouzja had the chance to tie for first with a win in his final game. However, due to the tournament's tiebreaker rules, he would be unable to compete for first place even if he finished with the same number of points as the tournament's leaders. In his final round matchup against Radosław Wojtaszek, the arbiters suggested mid-game that the two move to a different table, irritating Firouzja. The situation generated controversy and the event organizers ultimately apologized. The game ultimately ended in a draw, and Firouzja placed fifth in the tournament with a score of 8/13 (+4-1=8), level with Andrey Esipenko and Fabiano Caruana on points who finished third and fourth, respectively. He had a 2806 TPR for the event and went up to number 13 in the world rankings. He was the 8th seed at the Chess World Cup 2021, but was knocked out in the second round by Javokhir Sindarov.
In September, Firouzja participated in the Norway Chess supertournament 2021 edition. The participants in the tournament included Magnus Carlsen, Ian Nepomniachtchi, Richard Rapport, Sergey Karjakin and Norwegian player Aryan Tari. As now customary, the tournament was held with a football scoring system (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss). In case of a draw, games were decided in an armageddon playoff where a victory would provide an additional 1/2 point.
Firouzja finished with 2nd place (18), 1.5 points behind Carlsen (19.5) and ahead of Nepomniachtchi, Karjakin and Rapport. By the standard scoring method, Firouzja's score of 5 victories, 2 losses and 3 draws would have been enough to tie for 1st place, but Carlsen's extra points from wins in the armageddon meant he won the tournament. In the process, Firouzja moved into the world's top 10 for the first time.

Staub v. Proctor Hospital

Staub v. Proctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411 (2011), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court held that employers are still liable under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act if they fire an employee based on the recommendation of a subordinate who is acting out of hostility towards the employee's military obligations, even if the firing employer is not aware of or does not hold those discriminatory views himself.
Background.
Statutory provisions.
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) was passed by Congress in 1994 to guarantee to military reservists a return to their civilian jobs after their deployments. The law also offers protection against termination or other retaliation against current and former military members because of their military obligations. USERRA says, in part, that: 
Lower court proceedings.
The case arose when Vincent Staub, the plaintiff, was terminated from his job as a radiology technician at Proctor Hospital in Illinois in April 2004. Staub was a member of the Army Reserve and was periodically required to take time off of work for training. According to Staub, Janice Mulally and Michael Korenchuk, two of Staub's supervisors, were openly hostile towards him and belittled his military obligations. In 2004, Korenchuk advised the hospital's vice-president of human resources, Linda Buck, that Staub had broken a rule about remaining in the hospital while not seeing patients, despite the fact that Staub had merely visited the hospital's cafeteria and Staub had left a note for his supervisors explaining his absence after he could not contact them directly.
Staub was fired from his job for the alleged breach of the minor infraction. He sued the hospital, claiming that the complaint against him was a sham, and that the real reason he had been fired was due to the hatred of military members demonstrated by his supervisors. The jury sided with Staub and awarded him damages, but the hospital appealed the judgement. The Seventh Circuit reversed the jury's decision, and found in favor of the hospital. Staub appealed, and was granted certiorari by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court's decision.
The Supreme Court reversed the decision made by the Seventh Circuit in a unanimous 8-0 vote on 1 March 2011, with Justice Elena Kagan recusing herself. In the Court's opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court opined that "since a supervisor is an agent of the employer, when he causes an adverse employment action the employer causes it; and when discrimination is a motivating factor in his doing so, it is a 'motivating factor in the employer's action.'” Therefore, if a biased supervisor tries to get an employee fired, and that employee is in fact fired as a result, then the fired employee can sue the employer for employment discrimination, "even if the biased supervisor is not the final decision maker and even if the final decision maker is unbiased."

Chou Yang-shan

Chou Yang-shan (; born 24 August 1957) is a Taiwanese politician. He sat on the Legislative Yuan from 1996 to 1999, was a member of the National Assembly in 2005, and served on the Control Yuan between 2008 and 2014.
Career.
Chou attended National Taiwan University (NTU), and completed graduate studies at Columbia University. He was a reporter for the "China Times" and "United Daily News", then taught at NTU and National Chengchi University.
Chou was elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1995 from Taipei 1. He represented the New Party and was the party's caucus convener. After stepping down from the Legislative Yuan, Chou returned to NTU as a political analyst. In this position, he spoke to the media regarding foreign affairs, public opinion, the political nomination process, and constitutional reform. Though it was reported that Chou had accepted a nomination from the People First Party in the legislative elections of 2001, he was not elected to the Legislative Yuan for a second term. Instead, he represented the New Party in a case before the Central Election Commission regarding the joint nomination of Wang Chien-shien. He continued teaching at NTU, and also served as an advisor to the Control Yuan. 
Chou was elected to the National Assembly in 2005, and attended the legislative body's final meeting prior to its suspension. By 2007, he had joined the faculty of Chinese Culture University, and, backed by the New Party, launched an unsuccessful bid for the Legislative Yuan. Shortly thereafter, Chou was nominated and confirmed for a seat on the Control Yuan. In July 2009, Chou and began investigating the Miaoli County Government's decision to remove kilns in Houlong Township in favor of urban redevelopment. Chou aided other probes regarding infrastructure, public land use, and immigration. In November 2010, Chou motioned to impeach Hu Chen-pu for misusing government funds. In January 2011, Chou disputed Lai Shin-yuan's statement that Taiwanese citizens have free choice with regard to the future because the Constitution of the Republic of China mandates unification with the mainland. That year, Chou participated in reviews exploring the possibility of simultaneous presidential and legislative elections for 2012, the South China Sea territorial disputes, and the average age of Taiwanese diplomats. In August, Chou and Ma Hsiu-ru's report on management practices at the Central News Agency led to the censure of the Government Information Office and Executive Yuan. Three months after the action against the GIO, Chou launched an investigation into Vanessa Shih, Taiwan's representative to Singapore. Upon completing the report in July 2012, Chou advocated for its conclusions to be declassified. Chou's agency eventually decided against his proposal. Though the "United Daily News" speculated that Chou would resign over this disagreement, he did not do so. Chou ended 2012 by finishing probes into social services for indigenous people and air pollution, while commencing an investigation into the construction of Miramar Resort Village on Shanyuan Bay in Taitung. In April 2013, a report authored by Chou pushed authorities to declassify documents relating to the 228 Incident. Controversially, this report quoted , who stated that Lee Teng-hui was of Japanese descent. That July, a report written by Chou and Ma Hsiu-ru led to the censure of the Ministry of Culture. Chou left the Control Yuan at the end of his six-year term in 2014, and later joined the faculty of National Quemoy University.

Philip A. Gale

Philip Alan Gale (born 1969) is a British chemist and Head of the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney. He is notable for his work on the supramolecular chemistry of anions.
Gale was born in Liverpool and grew up in Woolton attending Gateacre Community Comprehensive School. He moved to Wadham College, University of Oxford, where he received his B.A. (Hons) degree in 1992 (M.A. Oxon. 1995) then moving in October 1992 to Linacre College where he graduated with a D.Phil. degree in 1995. He then moved to the University of Texas at Austin as a Fulbright Scholar with Prof. Jonathan Sessler. He returned to Oxford in 1997 as a Royal Society University Research Fellow and moved to a lectureship at the University of Southampton in 1999. He was promoted to a personal chair in supramolecular chemistry in 2007 and served as Head of Chemistry at the University of Southampton between 2010 and 2016. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Oxford in 2014. In January 2017 he moved to the University of Sydney where he is currently Head of the School of Chemistry and Associate Dean (International) in the Faculty of Science.
Gale's research interests are in supramolecular chemistry and in particular the molecular recognition and transmembrane transport of anions. His early work concerned the design of structurally simple anion receptors and elucidating other processes such as proton transfer that often accompany anion complexation. More recent research has focused on transmembrane anion transport. Gale has designed and synthesised a variety of highly effective classes of anion transporters including tren-based tris-ureas and -thioureas, squaramides and "ortho"-phenylene-based bis ureas. In 2013 Gale and co-workers published a quantitative structure activity relationship study showing that in a series of simple thioureas with one n-hexyl substituent and a phenyl substituent with different groups in the 4-position, the lipophilicity of the receptor is the dominant molecular parameter determining effective transport, with smaller contributions from the receptors’ volume and affinity for chloride.
Very recent work has focused on the design of new assays to measure anion transport and the development of selective transporters. Gale is notable for his work at the interface of supramolecular and medicinal chemistry showing the effect that anionophores developed in his research group have on biological systems. This includes restoring the flux of chloride through epithelial cell membranes (with potential future application as a channel replacement therapy in cystic fibrosis) and causing cell death in cancer cells by triggering apoptosis and interfering with autophagy.
Other aspects of Gale's work on transmembrane transport include the first synthetic chloride pumping system that uses fatty acids as fuels to create a chloride gradient across a lipid bilayer membrane, and the development of anion transporters that can be switched by membrane potential gradients or by the presence of reducing agents found in higher concentrations in tumours than in healthy tissue.
Gale is listed as a Thomson Reuters/Clarivate Analytics Highly Cited Research in Chemistry and has received a number of awards for his research including the RSC Bob Hay Lectureship in 2004, RSC Corday-Morgan Prize in 2005, a 2013 Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award, RSC Supramolecular Chemistry Award in 2014 and the International Izatt-Christensen Award in Macrocyclic and Supramolecular Chemistry in 2018. In 2020 he was awarded a University of Sydney Vice-Chancellor’s Excellence Award for Outstanding Research and was highlighted by The Australian newspaper Research supplement (23rd September 2020) as an Australian Field Research Leader (Chemistry &amp; Material Sciences (general)).
Gale is the editor-in-chief of Coordination Chemistry Reviews and the co-editor-in-chief of Supramolecular Chemistry.

Mesoleptus

Mesoleptus is a genus of parasitic wasp in the family Ichneumonidae with a wide geographic distribution.
The antennae of its members are typically long, slender, and usually curved. The head is short and narrow with oval, slightly protruding eyes. The thorax is somewhat humped, with small wings. The cellules of the wings, which are small enclosed areas between veins, are either very small or entirely absent. It is characterized by the narrowed abdomen referred to as a petiole. Abdomen shape is usually oblong and smooth. The legs are slender and long, although the hindmost leg can be thickened.
Currently there are seven accepted species of "Mesoleptus". In 2008, Dr. Chris Williams at the National University of Ireland, Galway announced the discovery of what he believed to be a new species of "Mesoleptus", which he termed "Mesoleptus hibernica" for the ancient Latin name for Ireland. However, the species has yet to be confirmed by further specimens, and is therefore not considered official.

Cuffee

Cuffee, Cuffey, or Coffey is a first name and surname recorded in African-American culture, believed to be derived from the Akan language name Kofi, meaning "born on a Friday". This was noted as one of the most common male names of West African origin which was retained by some American slaves.
Racist connotation.
The name was used in the United States as a derogatory term to refer to Black people. For example, Jefferson Davis, then a US Senator from Mississippi who later became the President of the Confederate States, said that the discussion of slavery in the "Dred Scott v. Sandford" case was merely a question of "whether Cuffee should be kept in his normal condition or not."

Rook shooting

Rook shooting was a previously popular sport in the United Kingdom, in which young rooks were shot from tree branches, often using purpose-built rifles known as rook rifles. Rook shooting could serve as a form of pest control, a blood sport making living targets of animals, or a form of hunting for edible birds.
The rook tends to live in colonies known as rookeries, which over time grow and become nuisances in country areas. In rural Britain it was previously the practice to hold rook shoots where the juvenile birds, known as "branchers", were shot before they were able to fly. These events were both very social and a source of food (the rook becomes inedible once mature) as the rook and rabbit pie was considered a great delicacy.

Sakhi Shrine

Sakhi Shah-e Mardan Shrine or Ziyarat-e Sakhi (), is a shrine and mosque located in the Karte Sakhi area of Kabul, Afghanistan. It is associated with the place to which the cloak of the Islamic prophet Muhammad was brought and with a visit from Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad, who would become the fourth Caliph and first of the Twelve Imams. The shrine is located at the foot of the Asamayi Hill, now better known as Television Hill. To its north and west is the Sakhi Cemetery.
Design.
The shrine is decorated with glazed tiles in a neo-Safavid Persian style. The building bears many inscriptions, including dedicatory texts, Qurʾanic excerpts, prayers, Hadith, and poetry.
History and legend.
It is believed that the shrine marks the spot where the cloak of Muhammad was kept on its way to its present location in the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar. The cloak is said to have been woven by Muhammad himself with the help of his daughter Fatima, her husband, and Muhammad's cousin, Ali, and their sons, Hasan and Husayn. Before Muhammad died, he bequeathed his cloak to Uwais al-Qarani, telling Ali and Umar that Uwais should be given the cloak on his death. After the Muhammad's death, Uwais took the cloak to the Cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, where Muhammad received his first revelation. It is believed to have remained in the cave until it was taken to Baghdad by Shaykh al-Uliya Qutba al-Atqiya. Timur would later seize it and take to his capital of Samarqand, where is would stay until 1076/1665-66. The cloak was then taken to India, from where it was taken to Balkh, in the west of today's Afghanistan, by the then governor of the city, Mir Yar Beg. He built a fort in Juzgun, Badakhshan, to house the garment securely. Following the move of the cloak to Juzgun, the settlement became known as Fayzabad. The cloak would remain there for seventy-nine years.
In 1181/1767-8, Ahmad Shah Durrani decided to move the cloak to his capital of Kandahar. He entrusted the move to Shah Wali Khan E'temad al-Dawla. The cloak was taken on its journey by a group of the most pious men. Kabul was on the route south from Fayzabad, and it was near the edge of the town that the group stopped to rest and allow local people to view the cloak. One day, the men carrying the cloak noticed a man wearing green praying by it. On the third night, they dreamt that the man in green came to see the cloak once more. When he removed his sword from its sheath and placed it on a nearby rock they noticed that its blade had a double tip. They recognised the sword as Zulfiqar and its owner as Imam Ali. The rock on which Ali is believed to have placed his sword is now encompassed by the shrine building. When the men awoke, they knew that a shrine should be built on this spot. Ahmad Shah patronised the building of the first structure, with one dome over the rock. The cloak remained here for eight months, before continuing its journey south to Kandahar, where it remains today. It was notably brought out of its shrine and worn by Mullah Omar in 1996.
A second dome was added to the shrine by the mother of Amanullah Khan in 1919. The four additional domes were added during renovations which took place between 2008 and 2016.
Every year, a popular Nowruz celebration is held outside the shrine, during which a large banner is raised in remembrance of Imam Ali, who was the standard-bearer of Muhammad.
A small underground shrine can be accessed from the women's side of the building. Cut into the bed rock, a tight staircase leads down to a small cavelike chamber were women now leave petitions and votive offerings. On the men's side, there is a hand-print relic.
The shrine is visited mainly by Hazaras, a Shiʿi community. Largely due to this, the shrine has been victim to a number of significant attacks, including the March 2018 Kabul suicide bombing.

Bayley Fritsch (born 6 December 1996) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). A forward, tall and weighing , Fritsch has the ability to play as both a high marking and small crumbing forward. Considered a late bloomer, he missed out on selection with the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup as a junior. After winning the league rising star in the Eastern Football League, he joined the Casey Scorpions in the Victorian Football League (VFL) where he spent three seasons. The 2017 VFL season saw him win the Fothergill–Round Medal, play for Victoria in the state representative match, be named in the VFL Team of the Year, and finish runner-up in the league-leading goalkicker and Casey's best and fairest award. His season saw him drafted by the Melbourne Football Club in the second round of the 2017 AFL draft and he made his AFL debut in the opening round of the 2018 AFL season.
Early life.
Fritsch was born to Pauline and Scott Fritsch on 6 December 1996. After missing out on selection with the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup, he played twenty-two games from 2013 to 2014 with the Coldstream Football Club seniors in the Eastern Football League, a club which his father played a record 360 games and his grandparents, Dianne and John Jefcott, are life members. At seventeen years of age, he was named the league rising star for division three and four for the 2014 season in which he played twelve games and kicked forty-one goals for the under 19s, and ten games and thirty-two goals for the seniors. He then joined the Casey Scorpions (now known as the Casey Demons) in the Victorian Football League (VFL) at the start of the 2015 season, but experienced two injury-plagued seasons with a back fracture in 2015 and a knee injury in 2016.
Fritsch enjoyed continuity in the 2017 VFL season when he played nineteen matches and kicked forty-two goals for the season to finish as the runner-up in the Jim 'Frosty' Miller Medal as the VFL leading goalkicker. His performances for the first half of the season saw him selected for Victoria in a state representative match against Western Australia and he was named in Victoria's best players by "The Leader" and "The Courier". His first injury-free season at Casey saw him receive the Fothergill–Round Medal as the VFL's best young player and he was named on the half-forward flank in the VFL Team of the Year. Furthermore, he finished second in Casey's best and fairest behind then- player, Jack Trengove. Towards the end of the season, he was being touted as a potential AFL draftee when he was one of ten VFL players invited to the Victoria combine, with Casey Demons coach, Justin Plapp, saying Fritsch could become a "serious player" in the AFL if given the chance.
AFL career.
Fritsch was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club, Casey's AFL affiliate team, with their second pick and thirty-first overall in the 2017 national draft. A few days after the draft, it was announced his guernsey number would be 31, which was made famous by Australian Football Hall of Fame legend and Melbourne Hall of Fame legend, Ron Barassi, a six-time premiership player with the club. He competed for Melbourne for the first time in the AFLX competition, in which he kicked three goals in the second match with the "Herald Sun's" Glenn McFarlane writing the early glimpse of Fritsch showed he has strong composure in attack. He played in both of Melbourne's JLT Community Series matches and after the first match, in which he kicked three goals and was the standout player according to Fox Sports Australia's Riley Beveridge, widespread media were noting he was a strong chance to make his AFL debut in round 1. He made his debut in the three point loss to at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the opening round of the 2018 season. Fristch played a significant role in Melbourne's 2021 Grand Final premiership win by kicking 6 goals, becoming the first player to kick 6 goals in a Grand Final since Adelaide's Darren Jarman in 1997 and earning himself 10 Norm Smith Medal votes placing him second best on ground.
Playing style.
Described as a classy player by "The Leader's" Paul Amy, Fritsch is a high-marking forward and has a "penetrating left-foot with sure ball handling." With ESPN's Christopher Doerre writing he is untapped and "has the scope to develop into anything, Fox Sport Australia journalist, Riley Beveridge, further stated that he has the ability to add immediate X-factor.

Missing (2018 film)

Missing is a 2018 Indian psychological thriller film written &amp; directed by Mukul Abhyankar, produced by Shital Bhatia, Shabana Raza Bajpayee, Vikram Malhotra, Markand Adhikari, Anand Pandit &amp; Roopa Pandit and starring Tabu, Manoj Bajpayee and Annu Kapoor in the lead roles. It has also been referred to as murder mystery. It was released on 6 April 2018.
"Missing" marks the directorial debut of Mukul Abhyankar. Along with acting in it, Bajpayee also co-produced the film under his eponymous film production banner, which is also the banner's first co-produced film. Last seen in "Ghaath", Bajpayee and Tabu are reunited in this film after eighteen years. Annu Kapoor learnt French for the character of a Mauritian cop he played in the film.
Plot.
The film opens with Sushant Dubey preparing to go for a business trip. He arrives at a resort in Mauritius with his wife Aparna and their 3-year-old daughter Titli. Sushant persuades the resort's receptionist Naina to upgrade his single room to a double room. They settle in after a while and Sushant and Aparna make love. The man in the room below is shown to be creeping about and peeping into rooms. When Titli goes missing in the middle of the night, this man is shown to be the main suspect.
It is revealed that Sushant and Aparna are not married to each other. They met on the ferry to Mauritius. Sushant is in an unhappy marriage and Aparna is divorced. They talk and bond and Sushant invites Aparna to spend the next couple days with him. That is how they came to the resort. When Titli suddenly goes missing Aparna throws a fit. Sushant does not want their liaison to become public and the resort manager does not want to invite police scrutiny upon the resort. They try their best to find Titli but their efforts to contain the situation are foiled when Aparna calls the police.
Police inspector Buddhu begins the investigation. The CCTV footage first points to the creepy neighbor who has since checked out of the hotel. Over the protests of the resort manager the photograph of the neighbor is flashed on television and he is soon spotted about town with a little girl. When he is hauled in, Aparna finds that the girl is not Titli, and the man reveals that the girl is his own daughter. His ex-wife now has custody and the man visits the daughter once a month.
Buddhu calls in a sketch artist who draws two sketches based on the descriptions given, separately, by Aparna and Sushant. The sketches turn out to be completely different. Under intense grilling, Sushant discloses that Aparna could not bear children and the strain led to a mental breakdown. Titli is a hallucination, a figment of Aparna's imagination. Later in his room, Sushant tells Aparna that he cannot carry on the charade any more. Sushant later confesses to Buddhu that he and Aparna are not married and that they merely had an affair at the resort. He did not see Titli's face.
Back in his room, Sushant tells Aparna that he has kidnapped Titli at the behest of his friend who is Aparna's ex-husband. He threatens Aparna and rushes her out of the resort. As they run through the forest Aparna stops for a breath and asks for Titli. Sushant reveals that he did not know or kidnap Titli. Aparna now reveals that he was right. There was no 3-year-old but Titli does exist.
An old man arrives at the resort and asks after his daughter Titli. Buddhu is puzzled. The old man shows a photograph of Titli, who turns out to be Aparna. It is revealed that she is a dangerous mental patient who managed to escape from an asylum. As the old man, Titli's natural father, reveals the story of how Titli ended up in the asylum, the film ends as the deranged Titli attacks and kills Sushant with a meat Cleaver in the middle of the forest.
Promotion.
Film's release date was kept a secret as long as possible to reduce media interaction as the film makers feared plot revelations. The trailer was released by John Abraham.
Music.
The film contained only one song. It is a lullaby, called "So Ja Re", and is composed by M. M. Keeravani. The lyrics are penned by Manoj Muntashir and it is sung by Tabu herself. On the screen, Tabu sings this lullaby to put her daughter to sleep.
Critical reception.
Rachit Gupta of The Times of India criticized the acting performances along with the direction of the film and gave it a rating of 2 out of 5 calling it a "half-baked thriller". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV called "Missing" a "flawed film" and gave it a rating of 3 out of 5 saying that the only reason to watch this film is provided by the commendable acting performances of Tabu and Manoj Bajpayee. Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said that the movie doesn't make a great impact as a thriller but Tabu and Manoj Bajpayee have given noteworthy performances. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express criticized the film calling it a "shoddy mess" and gave it a rating of 0.5 out of 5. Shrishti Negi of News18 appreciated the performances of Tabu, Manoj Bajpayee and Annu Kapoor but criticized the film for its inconsistent screenplay which she felt was filled with loopholes and gave it a rating of 2 out of 5.
Box office.
"Missing" collected only 76 lakhs on its first week of release.

Yeosan Song clan

Yeosan Song clan () is one of the oldest Korean clans. Their Bon-gwan was in Yeosan, present day Iksan, North Jeolla Province. According to the research in 2015, the number of Yeosan Song clan was 298, 231. Their founder was Song Yu-ik (송유익, 宋惟翊). He was a descendant of Song Ju-eun who is the ancestor of the main three Song clans since the Gojoseon days. He became Prince of Yeosan () after his great-grandson, Song Song-rye (송송례, 宋松禮) (1207 - 1298), defeated the last military leader Im Yoo-mu (임유무, 林惟茂) (1248 - 1270), who lead the Mushin Government "무신정권" in the Goryeo days and was granted nobility by King Chungryeol of Goryeo. There are claims by Chinese scholers that Song Yu-ik was from the Ministry of Revenue during the Tang Dynasty but it seems only the names were the same but the founder of the clan and the mentioned are two different people as the time period does not match and the Yeosan Song chronicles does not mention anything.

MIR141

MicroRNA 141 is a non-coding RNA molecule that in humans is encoded by the MIR141 gene.
Function.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

<doc id="56917784" url="?curid=56917784" title="Lura Beam">
Lura Beam

Lura Beam (1887–1978) was an American educator, writer, and researcher. Her interests included the poor, minorities, women, education, and the arts. She co-authored two books discussing medical studies on sex adjustment and sex education with Robert Latou Dickinson, and a noted memoir of growing up in turn-of-the-century Marshfield, Maine. She was the long-time companion of Louise Stevens Bryant.
Early life and education.
Lura Beam was born in Marshfield, Maine, in 1887.
After graduating from the area high school in 1904, she attended the University of California at Berkeley for two years before transferring to Barnard College. She graduated from the latter institution in 1908. In 1907 she earned a master's degree from Columbia University.
Career.
Beam started her working life with the American Missionary Association. She worked as a teacher in black-only schools in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee, for three years and then became an administrator with the organization, serving as Assistant Superintendent of Education in the Deep South. She went on to work for other non-profit institutions such as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (1919–1926), the National Committee on Maternal Health (1927–1933), the General Education Board in New York City, the Interchurch World Movement, and the American Association of University Women (1937–1952).
As head of the arts department of the American Association of University Women in the 1940s, Beam helped assemble a series of traveling art exhibitions that circulated among AAUW branches. These exhibits, attended by more than 770,000 viewers, presented "artwork based on themes such as the artwork of Colorado or Mexican children, trends in American painting, and African sculpture", as well as modern art and reproductions by Picasso, Matisse, Klee, and Roualt.
Beam retired in 1952 but continued to write and organize art exhibitions; she also assembled research on aging and retirement.
Works.
Beam co-authored two books with physician Robert Latou Dickinson, "A Thousand Marriages: A medical study of sex adjustment" (1931) and "The Single Woman: A medical study in sex education" (1934). In these books, Beam "adopted a feminist perspective by focusing on the changing historical context that affected women's lives between 1895 and 1930, as well as by analyzing the dominant-submissive relationship between the male physician (Dickinson) and his female patients".
Beam is best known in her home state for her 1957 work "A Maine Hamlet", which one review called "the book that a generation of readers treasured as the most perceptive account of traditional life in Maine ever written". Beam wrote vividly about growing up with her grandparents in Marshfield, Maine, at the turn of the century, describing the residents, institutions, lifestyle and community tenets.
Personal life.
Beam was the long-time companion of Louise Stevens Bryant, whom she met while working for the Committee on Maternal Health in the 1920s. Their relationship spanned nearly 35 years. Bryant was the one who encouraged Beam to write her memories of small-town life in her book "A Maine Hamlet" (1957). After Bryant's death in 1957, Beam prepared her biography in the work "Bequest from a Life: A biography of Louise Stevens Bryant" (1963).
Beam died in 1978. Her papers are held by the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.

C-c motif chemokine ligand 27

C-C motif chemokine ligand 27 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCL27 gene.
Function.
This gene is one of several CC cytokine genes clustered on the p-arm of chromosome 9. Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The CC cytokines are proteins characterized by two adjacent cysteines. The protein encoded by this gene is chemotactic for skin-associated memory T lymphocytes. CCL27 is associated with homing of memory T lymphocytes to the skin, and plays a role in T cell-mediated inflammation of the skin. CCL27 is expressed in numerous tissues, including gonads, thymus, placenta and skin. It elicits its chemotactic effects by binding to the chemokine receptor CCR10. The gene for CCL27 is located on human chromosome 9. Studies of a similar murine protein indicate that these protein-receptor interactions have a pivotal role in T cell-mediated skin inflammation.

Joe Albany at Home

Joe Albany at Home is a solo album by the pianist Joe Albany, recorded in 1971 and released on the Spotlite label in the UK and on the Revelation label in the US as "At Home Alone" in 1976.
Reception.
Allmusic's Scott Yanow wrote, "This release was quite important for a couple of reasons. It was the first LP put out by the British Spotlite label and only the second date led by the legendary (and until then largely forgotten) bop pianist Joe Albany ... The recording quality is decent if not state-of-the-art, but the playing is quite excellent and fortunately led to the rediscovery of this important "missing link"".

<doc id="56917956" url="?curid=56917956" title="Irogane">
Irogane

Irogane (色金 "coloured metals") is the term for a set of Japanese metals – forms of copper (with natural impurities), and copper alloys – treated in "niiro" patination processes, traditionally used in sword-making, catches for sliding doors, and luxury highlights on larger objects, and in modern times, in jewellery. The alloys contain two to five metals. Some scholars believe that methods similar to those involved in irogane production may also have been used in ancient Egypt and the Roman world, as well as China (wu tan) and Tibet (dzne-ksim).
History.
Raw copper with natural impurities, including yamagane, and highly refined copper (akagane, motogane) have been known from early times, and the alloys can be traced back between 300 and 900 years, or possibly as much as 1200. Shakudo, for example, may be referenced back to at least the 12th century. Shibuichi has a history of 550–750 years, with samples known from the 1630s. Due to the precious metal content, shakudo and shibuichi were always used sparingly, for small fittings on weapons, doors, small containers, or furniture.
The single most common historical usage was on the fitting known as a "tsuba" that is fitted below the pommel of the swords carried by samurai and the shōgun, and in fact the banning of ceremonial sword-wearing under the Meiji Restoration had a material impact on production of the irogane metals.
Etymology.
Irogane, or iro-gane, simply means "coloured metals". The same kanji character (金) is sometimes used for metal ("kane" or "gane"), gold ("kin") and silver ("gin"), and aside from the name irogane itself, these are elements of some of the irogane metal names. Others involve a combination of name elements from component metals and colours, for example, and one a reference to alloy composition proportions.
Nature.
The better known irogane metals include:
According to William Gowland, a professor and senior member of the Japan Society in London (who was for a time Director of the Imperial Japanese Mint), aside from copper with natural impurities, the Japanese craftsmen would sometimes add a "pseudo-speiss" (a mix including some arsenic and / or antimony) to copper ore to make a base for production alloys.
Finishing.
The colouring and finishing of irogane surfaces generally involves polishing and cleaning, and chemical patination, and might include some final waxing or other treatment.
Patination.
The chemical colouring of the surface is the key to irogane metals, and the details of the processes, and especially the compositions of the materials used to bathe the metals, are passed on within Japanese craft circles, and not widely documented, though some information was written down from the middle of the Edo period, and published more generally, in Japanese, in the early 20th century. Some simple recipes have been circulated, and some analysis of treated surfaces done in an attempt to understand the topic further, with considerable but still partial success. This process, an instance of soft-metal patination, known as niiro(-eko), or nikomi-chakushoku, and involving rokushō, has a history of at least 600 years but given references to at least one irogane metal, shakudo, go back 900 or more years, some similar process must have a like history.
Many of the patination processes involve boiling the metal in the modifying solution, and the final colour can depend on the duration of the boiling period, which may range from minutes to hours. Suaka, for example, may advance from a light brown after 2–4 hours, to orange-brown after 6 hours, to red towards 10 hours.
Notably, the traditional patination methods affect each metal differently, and have little or no effect on silver and gold elements, allowing for interesting effects when an object comprising multiple metals is patinated in one go to produce multiple final colours. Other effects are created by cutting through layers of patination to let underlying surfaces show through partly.

Voices (Gary Peacock album)

Voices is a studio album by American bassist Gary Peacock featuring pianist Masabumi Kikuchi, percussionist Masahiko Togashi and drummer Hiroshi Murakami. The album was recorded in Tokyo in 1971 and released via Sony Records label.
Reception.
Peter Margasak of "Chicago Reader" stated "On these early recordings with Peacock, Masabumi Kikuchi hadn't quite achieved the Spartan sound he eventually mastered, but he was on his way, playing mercurial lines amid Peacock's churning patterns. The 1971 album Voices, a trio session with alternating drummers Masahiko Togashi and Hiroshi Murakami, has been stuck in my CD player for days. It occupies the same meditative, questing terrain explored by Paul Bley before its release and by Keith Jarrett after. I'm a sucker for its elegant sense of dynamics, which gives empty space a crucial role in the arrangements and improvisations."

Shooting of Stephon Clark

In the late evening of March 18, 2018, Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old African-American man, was shot and killed in Meadowview, Sacramento, California by Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet, two officers of the Sacramento Police Department in the backyard of his grandmother's house while he had a phone in his hand. The encounter was filmed by police video cameras and by a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter which was involved in observing Clark on the ground and in directing ground officers to the point at which the shooting took place. The officers stated that they shot Clark, firing 20 rounds, believing that he had pointed a gun at them. Police found only a cell phone on him. While the Sacramento County Coroner's autopsy report concluded that Clark was shot seven times, including three shots to the right side of the back, the pathologist hired by the Clark family stated that Clark was shot eight times, including six times in the back.
The shooting caused large protests in Sacramento, and Clark's family members have rejected the initial police description of the events leading to Clark's death. The Sacramento Police Department placed the officers on paid administrative leave and opened a use of force investigation. Police have stated they are confident that Clark was the suspect responsible for breaking windows in the area prior to the encounter.
On March 2, 2019, the Sacramento County district attorney announced that the Sacramento police officers who killed Clark would not be charged and that they had probable cause to stop Clark and were legally justified in the use of deadly force.
Stephon Clark.
Stephon Clark (born Stephan Alonzo-Clark, August 10, 1995 – March 18, 2018) an African American, graduated from Sacramento High School in 2013, where he was on the football team. He was 22 years old at the time he was killed. According to "The Los Angeles Times", Clark lived in a "tough neighborhood" characterized by tense relations with the Sacramento Police Department. His older brother, Stevante Clark, told KOVR that he and Stephon had come from "underprivileged, broken homes". Their 16-year-old brother was killed in a shooting in 2006. Stephon had been released from county jail about a month before the shooting and was staying with his grandparents on and off. His brother said, "He was arrested before, but he's been different lately. He really changed his life." Sacramento County court records show that Clark had a history of convictions for robbery, domestic abuse, and a prostitution-related offense. At the time of his death he was on probation for a 2014 robbery conviction. According to the investigation, Clark had searched online for ways to commit suicide. A toxicology report also released by police found traces of cocaine, cannabis, and codeine in Clark's system. Codeine and hydrocodone were found in Clark's urine. Multiple leaders in the community opined that Clark's criminal record was immaterial to his death.
Domestic incident.
On March 16, a neighbor called the police to report on behalf of Salena Mohamed Manni, the mother of Clark's child, to report that the two had been arguing and the argument had turned violent. When police arrived at their apartment, Clark was not present, but officers found Manni with extensive injuries to her face and a hole in the wall of the apartment. Clark, on probation from two domestic violence convictions and one conviction of assault with a deadly weapon, evaded police in the days leading up to the shooting.
Shooting.
The Sacramento Police Department stated that on Sunday, March 18 at 9:18 p.m., two officers responded to a 9-1-1 call that an individual was breaking car windows. In a media release after the shooting, police stated that they had been looking for a suspect hiding in a backyard. They said the suspect was a thin black man, in height, wearing darkly colored pants and a black hooded sweatshirt. A sheriff's helicopter spotted a man at 9:25 p.m., in a nearby backyard and told officers on the ground that he had shattered a window using a tool bar, run to the front of that house, and then looked in an adjacent car.
Officers on the ground entered the front yard of Clark's grandmother's home, and saw Clark next to the home. Vance Chandler, the Sacramento Police Department spokesman, said that Clark was the same man who had been breaking windows, and was tracked by police in helicopters. Chandler said that when Clark was confronted and ordered to stop and show his hands, Clark fled to the back of the property.
Police body camera footage from both of the officers who shot Clark recorded the incident, though the footage is dark and shaky. In the videos, officers spot Clark in his grandmother's driveway and shout "Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop." The video shows that the officers chased Clark into the backyard and an officer yells, "Show me your hands! Gun!" About three seconds elapse and then the officer yells, "Show me your hands! Gun, gun, gun", before shooting Clark.
According to the police, before being shot, Clark turned and held an object that he "extended in front of him" while he moved towards the officers. The officers said they believed that Clark was pointing a gun at them. The police stated that the officers feared for their safety, and at 9:26 p.m., fired 20 rounds, hitting Clark multiple times. According to an independent autopsy, Clark was shot eight times, including six times in the back. The report found that one of the bullets to strike Clark from the front was likely fired while he was already on the ground.
Body-cam footage shows that after shooting him, the officers continued to yell at him as one shined a flashlight at him and they kept their guns aimed at him. One officer stated in one of the body-cam videos, "He had something in hands, looked like a gun from our perspective." Three minutes after the shooting, a female officer called to him and said "We need to know if you're OK. We need to get you medics, so we can't go over and get you help until we know you don't have a weapon." They waited five minutes after shooting Clark before approaching and then handcuffing him. Clark was found to have an iPhone, and was unarmed. Clark's girlfriend later said the phone belonged to her.
After more officers arrived, one officer said "Hey, mute", and audio recording from the body camera was turned off.
The Police Department stated on March 19, one day after the shooting, that Clark had been seen with a "tool bar". On the evening of that day, police revised their statement to say that Clark was carrying a cell phone, and not a tool bar, when he was shot. Police added that Clark might have used either a concrete block or an aluminum gutter railing to break a sliding glass door at the house next door to where he was shot, and that they believed Clark had broken windows from at least three vehicles in the area.
Investigation.
The Sacramento Police Department began a use-of-force investigation and placed both officers on paid administrative leave. On March 27, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that his department would provide independent oversight into the investigation, and separately would scrutinize the police department's use-of-force policies and training procedures.
Prior to the release of the county coroner's report, the family requested a second, independent autopsy, results of which were released March 30, 2018. The pathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, said Clark had been shot eight times from the back or side, adding "You could reasonably conclude that he received seven gunshot wounds from his back."
The Sacramento County Coroner's report was subsequently released to the public on May 1, 2018. The county autopsy, conducted by forensic pathologist Dr. Keng-Chih Su, indicated that Clark had been shot once in the front of the left thigh, three times directly to the side, and three times in the right side of the back. The Coroner's office had Dr. Su's autopsy reviewed by "the county’s chief forensic pathologist, and two county coroner pathologists, in addition to" forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Reiber.
On June 7, 2018, a "New York Times" team published an analysis also based on videos made by two police body cameras and by an overhead, heat-sensing helicopter camera.
During the investigation, it was discovered that Clark's phone records showed that he had called Salena Mohamed Manni 76 times leading up to the shooting, causing her to block his phone number. Clark also attempted to get ahold of his probation officer in the 48 hours after he was reported for domestic violence, but was unable to do so. Clark had also received text messages from Manni telling him that he would be sent back to prison for the domestic incident and that he would not see his children for a long time. Clark also texted other ex-girlfriends seeking drugs, as well as texting Manni that he was going to commit suicide. An examination of his internet search history also showed that he had been researching websites about suicide. 
On March 2, 2019, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announced that her office would not be filing criminal charges against the police officers involved in Clark's death. Schubert stated that the officers had probable cause to stop and detain Clark and that they were legally justified in using deadly force against him.
On September 26, 2019, US Attorney McGregor Scott and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced there was "insufficient evidence" to bring federal civil right charges against the officers. The Sacramento Police Department also said the department's investigation found no policy or training violations related to the shooting. The officers were cleared to return to active duty after they had been assigned to desk duty.
Officers.
The Sacramento Police Department initially stated that they would release the names of the officers who shot Clark within 10 days of the event. Sources leaked what they alleged were the names of the shooters; however, the Sacramento Police Department did not confirm the validity of the names citing fears for the officers' safety.
In March 2019 shortly after the district attorney decided to not press charges against them, the two officers came forward and revealed their identities (Terrance Mercadal and Jared Robinet), and opened up about their experience during the shooting in an interview with The Sacramento Bee.
Protests.
There were numerous public protests in Sacramento after the killing. On March 22, 2018, Black Lives Matter led a march that shut down Interstate 5 and prevented NBA fans from entering a Sacramento Kings game, resulting in a delay of the game.
One week after the shooting, the Sacramento Kings and Boston Celtics NBA teams wore shirts with Clark's name and the words "Accountability" and "We are One" during warm-ups and the national anthem.
On March 31, after an independent autopsy had concluded that Clark was shot eight times, mostly in the back, hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Sacramento. The peaceful protest was led by retired NBA player Matt Barnes, who announced that he is starting a scholarship fund for Clark's sons.
Local activist Wanda Cleveland was struck by a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department vehicle at a rally. Video of the incident shows that a number of protesters converged on official vehicles and were ordered over loudspeakers to step away. One sheriff's vehicle hit Cleveland and knocked her down while she was standing in front of the car. According to Cleveland the vehicle was accelerating and "never even stopped" when it hit her. She was hospitalized with bruises on her head and arm and released the next morning. Members of the progressive advocacy group National Lawyers Guild who were present during the protest said the vehicle "accelerated very fast" as it hit Cleveland and then "sped off". According to the sheriff's department, "A collision occurred while the patrol vehicle was traveling at slow speeds." The California Highway Patrol is investigating the matter. 
At a press conference, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones blamed "paid professional protesters" and "professional instigators that infiltrate the protests for their own purposes" for the incident. Protest organizers denied the allegation and were outraged by his comments. Sociology and political science professor David Meyer said Jones's allegation was not realistic. PolitiFact concluded that Jones did not provide evidence to his claim, and rated his claim as false.
Responses.
Elected officials and political activists.
Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, initially said he would not second-guess decisions made by officers on the ground. Following public backlash, Steinberg stated the videos of Clark's shooting made him feel "really sick" and that the shooting was "wrong," however declined to comment whether the officers should be charged. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated that Clark "should be alive today". Reverend Al Sharpton stated that he was alarmed by the story, which he said had not received enough media attention.
On March 26, White House spokesman Raj Shah stated that he was unaware of any comments from President Donald Trump regarding the incident. Two days later, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Trump is "very supportive of law enforcement" and that the incident was a "local matter" that should be dealt with by the local authorities.
Clark family.
Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents the Clark family, stated that the autopsy finding was inconsistent with the official narrative that Clark was charging toward the police officers when they fired. Clark's family expressed skepticism of the police version of events. Clark's brother, Stevante Clark, said of police statements: "They said he had a gun. Then they said he had a crowbar. Then they said he had a toolbar ... If you lie to me once, I know you'll lie to me again." Clark's aunt Saquoia Durham said that police gave Clark no time to respond to their commands before shooting him. According to Crump the officers did not identify themselves as police when they encountered Clark. The police have stated that the officers who confronted Clark were wearing their uniforms at that time.
In January 2019, Clark's two underage sons filed a civil lawsuit against Sacramento and the two officers who shot Clark, seeking $20 million in damages. In September 2019, the city settled the lawsuit for $2.4 million; each son will receive $900,000 tax-free when they turn 22.
Policing experts.
University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoffrey Alpert stated that it might be hard for officers to justify their conclusion that Clark was armed, since they had been told he was carrying a toolbar. Peter Moskos, assistant professor of Law and Police Science at John Jay College, said that the officers appeared to think they had been fired upon following the shooting. Alpert, Clark's family, and protesters questioned officers' decisions to mute their microphones. Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he was unable to explain the muting. Cedric Alexander, former police chief in Rochester, New York, and former president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, said that the muting did not appear to violate any policy, although the action would reflect poorly on the officers. He also stated that it is not unusual for police to mute their body cams and that attorneys advise the police to mute conversations to prevent recording any comments that could be used in administrative or criminal proceedings.
Policy changes.
In April 2018, the city of Sacramento enacted a policy that generally prohibits police officers from shutting down their body cams and audio recording devices. In July 2018, the Sacramento Police Department changed its foot pursuit policy, requiring officers to assess the danger chasing a suspect poses to officers and to the public.

Regen Depression

The Regen Depression () is a wide river valley in the Bavarian Forest along the River Regen. 
As natural region major unit no. 404 the Regen Depression belongs to the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest and covers an area of 667 km². It separates the Anterior Bavarian Forest in the southwest from the High Bavarian Forest in the northeast. In the northwest it is adjoined by the Cham-Furth Depression and, in the southeast, the Abteiland.
The Regen Depression is a large region, divided into various basins, at a height of 600 to 700 metres above sea level. The Regen flows through this gently rolling terrain in large curves. The river is impounded at the Regener See, Höllensteinsee and Blaibacher See. Heavily eroded, strongly weathered gneisses and granites are common. These are remains of weathered Tertiary platforms and Pleistocene solifluction soils. 
Compared to other areas of the Bavarian Forest, the climate is relatively mild. At 800 to 1200 mm per year, precipitation is lower than on the surrounding mountain ranges and temperatures are higher during the growing season. In winter, however, pockets of cold air are formed in the valleys. 
The area is a wooded, increasingly intensively farmed agricultural landscape characterized by grassland. Throughout its length, the Regen is traversed by the Bavarian Pfahl, an unusual geological structure. The largest settlements are the towns of Regen, Viechtach and Bad Kötzting.
Much of the landscape is near-natural, especially the around the river, but also parts of the Pfahl with its pine and birch stands. Otherwise grassland dominates, while the hillsides are mainly covered with spruce. The original beech and fir forests have been reduced to small remnants between the farmland and grassland on steeply sloping terrain. Most of the Regen Depression lies within the Bavarian Forest Nature Park, the northwestern part belongs to the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park.

Sandra Sabattini

Sandra Sabattini (19 August 1961 – 2 May 1984) was an Italian Roman Catholic and a member of the Associazione Comunità Papa Giovanni XXIII. Sabattini first joined the association after meeting its founder Oreste Benzi in her late childhood and began to work alongside drug addicts and ill people with the dream of becoming part of the medical missions in Africa. It was later on that she became engaged but her life was cut short after being run over in a car accident while going to attend a meeting of the association near Rimini.
Don Benzi pushed and lobbied for her process for beatification to be launched and this permission was granted over two decades later not long before Benzi himself died. The cause opened and she became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and titled Sabattini as Venerable on 6 March 2018 while on 2 October 2019 confirming a miracle attributed to her intercession. Sabattini was meant to be beatified in Rimini on 14 June 2020 but the coronavirus pandemic forced the Rimini diocese to postpone it. It has been rescheduled for 24 October 2021.
Life.
Sandra Sabattini was born on 19 August 1961 in Rimini at the Riccione Hospital as the first of two children to Giuseppe Sabattini and Agnese Bonini; her brother was Raffaele, now a medical doctor working at Ceccarini Hospital in Riccione. The Sabattini's lived in Misano Adriatico before relocating in Rimini in 1965 to the parish church of San Girolamo to live with her priest uncle Don Giuseppe Bonini who was the pastor of the parish.
Sabattini's pious nature as a child extended to keeping a journal since 27 January 1972 in order to record her spiritual thoughts. It was around 1973 that she first met the Servant of God Oreste Benzi at one of the several meetings of Benzi's Associazione Comunità Papa Giovanni XXIII that her uncle organized in his parish. In summer 1974 she took part in a summer program for teenagers at the Madonna delle Vette house in Canazei (Trento) for people with disabilities. This experience left her with a profound spiritual enthusiasm that upon returning home she told her mother: "We worked till we dropped but these are people I'll never leave". In 1980 she completed her high school examinations in Rimini before beginning her education in medicine at the college in Bologna. Sandra Sabattini was known for having achieved excellent results in each of her examinations.
But within her was the desire to become part of the medical missions in Africa to work alongside the poor and ill. On the weekends and in the summer breaks of 1982 and 1983 she tended to drug addicts in the association's rehabilitation centers. Sabattini got up each morning to meditate in the church in the dark before the Eucharist and loved to do so on the floor to demonstrate her meek and humble nature; she sang in a choir and learned the piano. Sabattini later met Guido (who was a bit older than her) at a Carnivale event. The two started dating and were later engaged to be married though both decided to lead a chaste engagement. To their delight both wanted to become missionaries in Africa after getting married, but her father – who knew of the couple's dreams – advised his daughter to take things at a slow pace rather than to rush into things.
In late April 1984 the association prepared for their meeting in Igea Marina near Rimini. On 29 April at 9:30 am she arrived there via car alongside her fiancé and her friend Elio. Just as she got out of the car both she and Elio were struck by a passing car, placing her into a coma from which she never recovered. Less than a week later, on 2 May, Sabattini died from her injuries at Bellaria Hospital in Bologna. Her funeral was celebrated on 5 May in the San Girolamo church in Rimini and she was buried outside the S. Andrea church of Misano Adriatico.
In 1985 don Benzi edited the first edition of her journal and did so again in 2003 alongside notes on her life. Father Benzi once said that "Sandra should not be sought among the dead" alluding to potential exhumation. Father Benzi's musings proved correct for in 2009 (after don Benzi died) an exhumation took place but no remains were found. This was attributed to the fact that she wished to be buried in bare earth which meant corrosion of the casket was most probable following interment.
Beatification.
The Emilia-Romagna Episcopal Conference expressed on 30 January 2006 their favorable opinion to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to initiate the proceedings for the cause of beatification for Sabattini. This was something that don Oreste Benzi lobbied for after she had died. The C.C.S. provided their assent on 11 July 2006 after declaring "nihil obstat" (no objections) and titling Sandra Sabattini as a Servant of God. The diocesan process of investigation was launched on 27 September 2006 and was closed on 6 December 2008.
The Positio dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. for evaluation; theologians confirmed the cause and C.C.S. members followed on 6 March 2018. It was also on 6 March that Pope Francis confirmed that Sabattini lived a model life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable. On 2 October 2019 the pope confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession which would allow for her beatification. The Rimini diocese announced on 1 November 2019 that the beatification would take place on 14 June 2020; the coronavirus pandemic forced the Rimini diocese on 6 April 2020 to announce that the beatification would be postponed until further notice. The event has been rescheduled for 24 October 2021.
The current postulator for this cause is Monsignor Fausto Lanfranchi.

András Kenessei

András Kenessei (born Budapest, Hungary, 12 January 1942) is a Hungarian art historian, writer and journalist.
Career.
András Kenessei graduated from Kölcsey Ferenc Secondary School [Kölcsey Ferenc Gimnázium] in 1960. 
Initially not admitted to the university, two years later he applied to and got admitted to Eötvös Loránd University [ELTE], where he studied Hungarian language and literature as well as art history at the Faculty of Arts, completing his studies in 1967. He wrote his thesis on the construction of the Avenue [Sugárút], which is now called Andrássy Avenue [Andrássy út] – making him the first in his profession to write about this grandiose enterprise in Hungarian eclectic architecture which transformed the Budapest cityscape. He maintained his interest in Hungarian and international architecture later on in his career.
Kenessei's articles, papers on art, and reviews have been published in journals as well as culture columns in daily papers and weekly magazines (i.e., Budapester Rundschau, Élet és Irodalom, Művészet, Népszabadság, Ország-Világ, Rakéta Regényújság, Tükör, Új Tükör) since 1964. Since 1966, he has also written literary pieces, which have regularly appeared on the pages of leading literary journals, such as Kortárs and as well.
Having graduated from university, Kenessei made a living as a freelance writer for several years. During that time, he interned as an editor at the publishing house Magvető Könyvkiadó and worked as a journalist for various weeklies. He later worked for the Hungarian Record Company [Magyar Hanglemezgyártó Vállalat], compiling prose recordings and jazz albums released by the record company.
Between the summer of 1977 and May 1992, Kenessei worked for the daily newspaper Magyar Hírlap as a member of the editorial team responsible for culture and foreign affairs. Starting out as a correspondent, he was later appointed to be deputy column editor and, subsequently, senior newspaper contributor. Having written numerous highly professional reviews, characterized by both empathy and bold bluntness, he was commissioned by the ballet director and choreographer of the Hungarian State Opera House [Magyar Állami Operaház], László Seregi, to write papers to be published in the program booklet for all three of his Shakespeare ballet productions.
The pieces written by Kenessei for the daily Magyar Hírlap encompass several journalistic genres, ranging from articles, accounts, interviews, reports, and feature pieces, to reviews on films, theatre productions, radio and television shows, concerts, books, and recordings. In addition, over the course of the last third of his fifteen years as a member of the editorial staff, he found an increasing interest in the economic aspects of culture.
This interest was maintained even after he left the newspaper, and, for many years, he wrote weekly articles on aesthetically and economically relevant issues pertaining to the art-dealing scene in Hungary and abroad, with his pieces being published in the newspaper's business supplement, entitled Pénz Plusz Piac (Money Plus Market). It was around this time that he also took an interest in the stock market.
Starting in the early 1980s, Kenessei worked as a contributor on several cultural radio shows broadcast on Hungarian National Radio [Magyar Rádió], most notably contributing to the weekly cultural review show Láttuk, Halottuk [Seen and Heard], hosted by András Kepes. From 1986, he made numerous television news pieces as a correspondent for TV-híradó [TV News], interviewing nationally and internationally prominent figures in the world of culture and art for the daily news program produced by Endre Aczél for Hungarian National Television [Magyar Televízió].
Kenessei wrote a radio play, entitled Terézvárosi hazugság [The Lie in Terézváros District], which aired on Hungarian National Radio in 1979. In addition, the television adaptation of his family saga Százezer ős [Hundreds of Thousands of Ancestors], directed by Erika Szántó, was broadcast on Hungarian National Television in 1991.
In 1989, Kenessei took up art dealing and focused on art-dealing- related communication, writing numerous articles, essays, accounts, and reviews about art and art dealing for daily newspapers, such as Magyar Hírlap, Népszabadság, and the business daily Világgazdaság (Zöld Újság), and also for various weekly magazines, thereby establishing a new genre in Hungarian journalism. The Hungarian National Federation of Retailers [Kiskereskedők Országos Szervezete – KISOSZ] invited him to hold specialized lectures on art dealing as part of the federation's first training course on art dealing, also commissioning him to write the textbook used in the course.
In 1991, Kenessei founded the art-dealing journal Műtárgy – Régiség [Artefacts – Antiquities], working as its publisher and editor until 2009, when it ceased publication. The founding of the journal coincided with the one-day conference held by Sotheby's in Budapest, which Kenessei organized at Fészek Művészklub, a renowned club for artists, in cooperation with the head of the company's Budapest office, Soraya Gräfin von Stubenberg. The conference saw six of Sotheby's department heads give presentations to Hungarian art dealers.
From 1998, Kenessei produced and hosted a television show dedicated to art dealing, entitled Licit [The Bid]. Concurrently, from 2000, he was in charge of the regular art-dealing segment of the radio show Chaplin kalapja [Chaplin's Hat], produced by János Simkó, and he also worked on the weekly show Tőzsdevilág (Stock Market World).
Since 2000, Kenessei has been living in both Vienna and Budapest, organizing and managing exhibitions of the works of contemporary Hungarian painters with his common-law partner, the Austrian citizen Katalin Herscovici, showcasing Hungarian paintings in Austria and Hungary. He continues to write reviews in Hungarian, publishing his pieces on visual arts and dance primarily on online sites. Additionally, between 2005 and 2007, he was a senior correspondent for Gazdasági Rádio, a business radio station, which aired his daily reports on the stock exchange as well as his sixty-minute weekly interviews. Kenessei's main fields of interest are the visual arts, music, and literature, collectively, along with contemporary Hungarian visual and applied arts as well as 20th century architecture and urban architecture. He has authored approximately 1,500 articles, papers, essays, portrait pieces on artists, and interviews.

Reach A Hand, Uganda (RAHU) is a youth serving nonprofit organisation based in Uganda that focuses on youth empowerment programs with an emphasis on, Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHR) of young people between the ages of 12–24 years including HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.

Overview.
Established in 2011, Reach A Hand Uganda draws inspiration from the personal life of Humphrey Nabimanya, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the organization. of the organization. Having been raised by HIV positive guardians, Humphrey was exposed to discrimination and stigma at a very early age by his fellow students and school staff who assumed he was HIV positive like his guardians. Through this struggle, he visualized the urgency to address the misconceptions that were caused by the information gap. Humphrey was compelled to educate not only his peers but also other young people about HIV/AIDS. Because of the great conviction and the activities he had engaged in, Humphrey conceptualized the idea of Reach A Hand Uganda, then, as a weekend outreach program to interact and inform other young people about HIV/AIDS. With the increasing need to inform young people about HIV/AIDS, Humphrey expanded RAHU to an officially registered organization in July 2011 as a fully youth immersed organization. Reach A Hand Uganda today, is still a youth fronted and youth concentrated organization focusing on youth empowerment programs with an emphasis on Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention.

Fuad Sami Haddad

Fuad Sami Haddad (; March 31, 1924 – October 9, 2015) was a neurosurgeon, humanitarian, and writer. He was born in Beirut and spent most of his life in Lebanon.
Personal life and education.
Haddad was born in Beirut's Ain El Mraiseh neighborhood. He was raised between here and the Haouz Sa'atyeh (حوز سعتيه) neighborhood. His mother, Lamia Morcos (1896–1994) raised Haddad along with his five siblings. The son of Sami Ibrahim Haddad, a doctor and writer, Haddad's dreams did not fall far from the proverbial tree.
He attended primary school at the Collège Protestant Français from 1928 to 1935 and secondary school at the International College of Beirut. He received both his Bachelor of Arts in 1944 and his M.D. in 1948 from the American University of Beirut. Haddad subsequently completed his surgical residency at the Orient Hospital.
He then began his neurosurgery residency under Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute on July 1, 1950. There, he completed fellowships in neuropathology, neuro-anatomy, and electroencephalography. He returned to Lebanon in 1955 as "the first neurosurgeon certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery to practice in the Middle East and... the entire Arab world."
In 1956, he married Aida Nasir, and together they raised six children of their own: Georges, Souheil, Fadi, Nabih, Labib, and Janane—two of whom are practicing neurosurgeons.
Career.
Upon his return to Lebanon, Haddad joined the faculty at the American University of Beirut and served the university until 2012. All the while, he kept a private practice where he "received patients from the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, the Levant, North Africa, Turkey, and Iran." 
The Lebanese Civil War began in 1975, making it difficult for American University of Beirut students to pursue a medical residency in the United States of America. Even before this era, Haddad saw a need and filled it with a neurosurgical residency program that remains successful to this day. Furthermore, on November 24, 1963, Haddad and his brother, Farid Haddad, were the founding members of the Lebanese Chapter of the American College of Surgeons. Both contributions to organized medicine in Lebanon marked great successes for practicing and future doctors who survived the war. Even during wartime, Haddad remained in Beirut as the only neurosurgeon serving the 450-bed American University Medical Center. "On a memorable spring weekend in 1976, he had to perform 13 craniotomies in a row for craniocerebral wounds. For 60 long hours he stood in the operating room mending the brain wounds of those unfortunate casualties."
Near the end of the war, Haddad was able to serve as a visiting professor in schools such as the University of Chicago, the University of Iowa, the Cleveland Clinic, the University at Albany, SUNY, and the University of Arkansas.
Haddad retired on February 1, 2012.
'Life under Fire'.
In 1988, Haddad was invited to address the 38th Annual Meeting of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons on the state of neurosurgery in the Middle East.
Haddad explains the differences in disease, as tuberculosis ravaged much of Iran while it was far less prominent, and therefore a lower diagnostic priority, in the United States. Additionally, Haddad addresses differences in societal stability, since he had spent much of his career working under fire during the Lebanese Civil War. He notes how the absence of telephone communication and electricity (at times for two to three weeks) made surgeries and post-operative care exceptionally difficult.
Haddad then shares that there exist more Lebanese surgeons in São Paulo, Brazil than in Lebanon. Lastly, to defend his reasons for staying in Lebanon while healthcare providers fled, he leaves no room for doubt that his heart, and hands, are dedicated to the people of Lebanon. He finishes his address with a story and a firm commitment to the people of Lebanon:
A further example is that of a veiled woman who entered my empty office on one of the worse days of the fighting. I wondered what brought her to me when everybody else, including my own secretary, was looking for shelter from bombs and snipers. Said she, ‘Doctor, I know these are trying days and everything is scarce. I have baked a few loaves of bread and thought you and your family might do with some of them.’ Indeed we had gone without bread for 3 or 4 days, with a family of six children. She offered me three loaves and left. She had walked over 5 miles to bring this bread to me. As long as there are people like these in Lebanon, I will stay to serve them, no matter what the price is, and I am confident that, like the phoenix who rose from his ashes, Lebanon will and shall rise.

Elisabethszell

Elisabethszell is a parish village ("Pfarrdorf") in the municipality of Haibach in the Lower Bavarian county of Straubing-Bogen in Germany.
History.
In 1346 in the place then known as Atzenzell, which belonged to the parish ("Pfarrei") of Haselbach, a priory of Benedictine abbey of Oberalteich was established. It existed, with interruptions, until church land in Bavaria was seized in 1803.
In 1498 the Benedictines were driven out by the Paulsdorfs at Falkenfels Castle. It was the Countess of Schwarzenberg, whose had inherited Elisabethszell from her forebears, who allowed Oberalteich Abbey to buy back the priory estates for a moderate sum in 1621, whereupon the clergy returned to Elisabethszell.
Secularisation in Bavaria in 1803 spelt the end of the priory at Elisabethszell. In 1805, Elisabethszell, hitherto part of the parish of Haselbach, became an independent parish. The priory was given by the state to the municipality of Elisabethszell for the establishment of a school. On 11 July 1877 the newly built parish church was consecrated by Bishop Ignatius von Senestréy.
The old cemetery was closed in 1967 and turned into a car park in the 1970s. A new cemetery was created above the Pfarrhof. With municipal reforms in Bavaria, the former municipality of Elisabethszell lost its independence and was incorporated on 1 January 1978 into Haibach.

Agelanthus myrsinifolius

Agelanthus myrsinifolius is a species of hemiparasitic plant in the family Loranthaceae, which is native to Rwanda, Zaire and Burundi.
Description.
For a brief description see the African Plant database.
Habitat/ecology.
"A. myrsinifolius" has been found at altitudes of 1900–3300 m in montane or swamp forests and in heaths. Recorded hosts are "Myrsine" and "Erica mannii" (at the higher altitudes).
Threats.
At lower altitudes, intense human population pressure means that outside the protected areas, forest is disappearing due to agriculture and logging. At these altitudes, the host, "Myrsine", is being cleared for agriculture. At the higher altitudes, the heath, "Erica mannii", is probably safe.

Kari Vilonen

Kari Kaleva Vilonen (born 1955) is a Finnish mathematician, specializing in geometric representation theory. He is currently a professor at the University of Melbourne.
Education.
He received in 1983 his Ph.D from Brown University under Robert MacPherson with thesis "The Intersection Homology "D"-module on Hypersurfaces with Isolated Singularities".
Career.
From 1983 to 1986 was a C. L. E. Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on leave in 1984–1985 at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California. Afterward, Vilonen was a Benjamin Pierce Assistant Professor at Harvard University from 1986 to 1989. From 1989 to 2000 he was a faculty member at Brandeis University, rising to the rank of Professor in 1996. After that, he was a professor at Northwestern University, and then a professor at the University of Helsinki from 2010 to 2015. Starting in 2015, Vilonen has been a Professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia.
In 2002, with Dennis Gaitsgory and Edward Frenkel, he proved the geometrical Langlands conjecture for curves over finite fields.
In 2004, Vilonen, Mark Goresky, Dennis Gaitsgory and Edward Frenkel were awarded a multimillion dollar grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on a project aimed at establishing links between the Langlands program and dualities in quantum field theory. Later, Frenkel wrote, "We felt like we were in uncharted territory: no mathematicians we knew had ever received grants of this magnitude before." The funds were used to coordinate the work of dozens of mathematicians with the goal of making a concerted effort in a significant area of research.
In 2007, with Ivan Mirković, he published "Geometric Langlands duality and representations of algebraic groups over commutative rings", which proved the geometric Satake equivalence, a geometric version of the Satake isomorphism.
In 2013, Vilonen received a Humboldt Prize. In 2014, he was awarded a Simons Fellowship from the Simons Foundation.
In 2020, the Australian Research Council awarded Vilonen an Australian Laureate Fellowship, their highest award to an individual. This five year grant will allow him to address deep longstanding questions about real groups, algebraic objects which describe the basic symmetries occurring in nature.
Awards and keynote addresses.
Vilonen was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1997/98. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker with talk "Topological methods in representation theory" at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. In 2004 he was elected a member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters.

Holy Trinity Church, Ilfracombe

The Church of the Holy Trinity is the Anglican parish church for Ilfracombe in Devon. The building has been a Grade I listed building since 1951 and comes under the Diocese of Exeter.
Standing on the site of a Saxon church, the Norman church was enlarged to its present size in 1322, and the tower incorporated inside the building. Built of mostly random rubble slate walls, some rendered, with limestone dressings, the church has one of the finest wagon-roofs in the West Country dating from the 15th-century which is richly carved with bosses, angels, figures and five Green Men in a row. At the East end of the nave above the former rood screen is a "ceilure" or Glory, with three bays enriched by cross-ribs and much decoration. The chancel ceiling is modern by George Fellowes Prynne in 1899. The square baptismal font is Norman of about 1160 and is decorated with three rosettes and ears of wheat on each face with a scalloped underside. It was moved to its present position in 1861 during the 1861-1864 restoration by John Hayward. The Elizabethan pulpit has arched columns and panels containing floral motifs. The lychgate and the vestry date from 1894 and are by Henry Wilson, the best pupil of J. D. Sedding. 
The first recorded Rector was Oliver de Tracey in 1263, which is also the approximate date of the first stone building on the site. Little remains of this church, ordered to be enlarged in 1321 by Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter when the nave was lengthened and the aisles added. The tower is 14th-century and is the oldest part of the building: it is low, single stage and very plain with a pointed north door and a lancet window and a low unmoulded arch opening into the nave. It is located in a north transeptal position, frequent in early North Devon churches. The north and south aisles are separated from the nave and chancel by eight bays of chamfered arches, four on each side on stunted octagonal piers; these are mid-to late 14th-century, while a piscina of the same date can be found in the chancel. The nave roof rests on stone corbels representing mythical beasts. The chapel in the north of the chancel is early 15th-century, while the aisle windows are from the Perpendicular Period. In the early 15th-century a North chapel was added. The stained glass is 19th-century and includes examples by Kempe (window in North aisle); Hardman (East window); Willement (south aisle East window) and Ballantyne (Stabb Memorial window).
The church has numerous monuments. There is a small brass cross which commemorates six men of the parish who died during World War I. In the churchyard is buried [[Anna Catherine Parnell]], the Irish nationalist and younger sister of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. Also in the churchyard are buried 19 British servicemen who died during [[World War I]] and whose graves are maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) along with those of two Belgian Foreign Nationals.

Structural battery

Structural batteries are multifunctional materials or structures, capable of acting as an electrochemical energy storage system (i.e. batteries) while possessing mechanical integrity.
They help save weight and are useful in transport applications such as electric vehicles and drones, because of their potential to improve system efficiencies. Two main types of structural batteries can be distinguished: embedded batteries and laminated structural electrodes.
Embedded batteries.
Embedded batteries represent multifunctional structures where lithium-ion battery cells are efficiently embedded into a composite structure, and more often sandwich structures. In a sandwich design, state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are embedded forming a core material and bonded in between two thin and strong face sheets (e.g. aluminium). In-plane and bending loads are carried by face sheets while the battery core takes up transverse shear and compression loads as well as storing the electrical energy. The multifunctional structure can then be used as a load-bearing as well as an energy storage material.
Laminated structural electrodes.
In laminated structural electrodes the electrode material possesses an intrinsic load-bearing and energy storage function. One example is for example based on a zinc anode, manganeseoxide cathode and a fiber/ polymer composite electrolyte. The structural electrolyte enables stable charge and discharge performance. This assembly has been demonstrated in an unmanned aerial vehicle. A commonly proposed structural battery is based on a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) concept. Here, carbon fibers serve simultaneously as electrodes and structural reinforcement. The lamina is composed of carbon fibers that are embedded in a matrix material (e.g. a polymer). Multiple layers of carbon fibers are impregnated with a matrix that enables load transfer between the fibers but also lithium-ion transport, unlike commonly used vinylester or epoxy matrices. This type of energy storage system can be based on a nickel or on lithium-ion chemistry. The laminate is made of the combination of a negative electrode, a separator and a positive electrode, embedded in an ionically conductive and structural electrolyte. In the laminated structural electrodes concept, carbon fibers can be used to intercalate e.g. lithium-ions (structural anode); similarly, to commercially available graphite anodes. The structural cathode consists of carbon fibers coated with electrochemically active species, e.g. lithium oxide particles. An example of a structural battery exploiting a carbon fiber negative electrode and lithium iron phosphate positive electrode was demonstrated to be capable of lighting an LED. Some separator material is used in between the two structural electrodes to prevent short-circuits. However, the CFRC concept described above is still being researched.

Diuris gregaria

Diuris gregaria, commonly known as clumping golden moths is a species of orchid that is endemic to Victoria. It between three and seven leaves and one or two bright yellow flowers with a few dark striations and usually grows in dense tufts of up to thirty plants. It is a rare species mostly only found in grassland west of Melbourne.
Description.
"Diuris gregaria" is a tuberous, perennial herb which often grows in densely crowded tufts of up to thirty plants. Each has between three and seven narrow linear leaves long and wide in a loose tussock. One or two bright yellow flowers with a few short, dark striations, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal is egg-shaped and held close to horizontally, long and wide. The lateral sepals are green, lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide, turned below horizontal and usually parallel to each other. The petals curve forwards, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide on a green stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are oblong to wedge-shaped, long and about wide with irregular edges. There are two dark yellow, pimply callus ridges near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris gregaria" was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Derrinallum and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("gregaria") is a Latin word meaning "pertaining to a flock or herd", referring to the clumping habit of this species.
Distribution and habitat.
Clumping golden moths grows in grassland on the basalt plains in western Victoria.
Conservation.
This orchid is classed as "endangered" under the Victorian government "Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988". Its range has been reduced by farming and agriculture.

The Naval Bases and Supply Agency and originally known as the Directorate-General Naval Bases and Supply was a defence agency within the Naval Support Command part of the UK Ministry of Defence. Its headquarters were at Ensleigh, Bath, England from 1995 to 2003 the agency was administered by the Chief Executive Naval Bases and Supply Agency.
History.
In October 1995 Directorate-General Naval Bases and Supply was formed as part of Naval Support Command by bringing together management of the Royal Navy's three main bases (Devonport, Portmouth and the Clyde) including, the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service its supply depots and the Directorate of Marine Services (Navy). On 11 December 1996 it was renamed the Naval Bases and Supply Agency. The organisation remit was to provide support to the office of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet simultaneously it cooperated closely with the newly formed Ship Support Agency (SSA). In 2001 the agency was absorbed with the Ship Support Agency to form the Warship Support Agency though its remained a part of the new agency until 2003.
When first formed it consisted of 13,350 personnel, 10,200 civilian staff and 3,150 military staff.

Future Combat Air System (UK)

The Future Offensive Air System was a study to replace the Royal Air Force's strike capability, at the time provided by the Tornado GR4. Initial operational capability was expected around 2017. The FOAS was cancelled in June 2005 and was replaced by the Deep and Persistent Offensive Capability (DPOC) requirement, which was itself cancelled in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review.
Various abortive projects and collaborations followed. Since 2018 the UK has been pursuing its Combat Air Strategy, a key part of which is the Future Combat Air System. As of 2021, the main output of this has been the BAE Systems Tempest aircraft concept and related technologies which will replace the Typhoon. France, Germany and Spain are collaborating on a replacement aircraft for their Rafale and Typhoon aircraft, also titled Future Combat Air System.
History.
In 1995, a Future Offensive Aircraft (FOA) was revealed, then a collaboration with Dassault, which would replace the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Panavia Tornado in the strike role. FOA became the Future Offensive Air System in December 1996, with an intended in-service date of 2015. The requirement was confirmed by the Strategic Defence Review which was published in July 1998. The concept was for a system of systems, rather than a single aircraft type. In 2004, "Flight International" suggested the options included "manned and unmanned combat aircraft, long-range cruise missiles, large non-penetrating aircraft and air-launched unmanned air vehicles".
In 2005, the FOAS project was cancelled and replaced by the Deep and Persistent Offensive Capability (DPOC). The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review announced the government's intention to switch its planned carrier aircraft from the short take-off and vertical landing F-35B Lightning to the F-35C carrier variant. The DPOC had been cancelled in July 2010, with the more capable F-35C deemed suitable to cover the resulting "capability gap". In May 2012 this decision was reversed due to the costs of modifying the "Queen Elizabeth"-class aircraft carriers for the F-35C.
Future Combat Air System.
Earlier in 2012 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) launched a new 4 year study, the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), for future "unmanned combat air systems". BAE Systems, one of the companies involved said this would "inform the MoD's unmanned air system strategy over the coming decades to ensure that the best use is made of these new technologies".
In November 2014 FCAS transitioned to an Anglo-French feasibility study of unmanned aircraft. The British and French governments awarded 6 development contracts for FCAS; BAE and Dassault would develop the airframe, Rolls-Royce and Safran the engine, and Selex ES and Thales the electronics and communications. The collaboration benefitted from prior development of the BAE Systems Taranis and Dassault nEUROn demonstrators. In March 2016 the UK and France announced their intention to invest £1.54 billion to advance the project to its next stage.
Divergent UK and French/German/Spanish projects.
In April 2018, Dassault Aviation and Airbus announced an agreement to cooperate on the development of a stealth fighter jet as a replacement for French Rafale, German Eurofighter and Spanish F-18 Hornet, also called Future Combat Air System (FCAS). A test flight of a demonstrator is expected around 2025 and entry into service around 2040.
In July 2018 the MoD published its Combat Air Strategy. The key elements of this are:
The document describes combat air as "An aircraft, manned or unmanned, whose prime function is to conduct air-to-air and/or air-to-surface combat operations in a hostile and/or contested environment, whilst having the ability to concurrently conduct surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare and command and control tasks."
Also in July 2018, BAE unveiled the Tempest as the planned sixth-generation fighter for the RAF.
"Defence in a Competitive Age".
The 2021 Defence command paper "Defence in a Competitive Age" announced a £2 billion investment in FCAS and the following aspiration:"FCAS will deliver an innovative mix of crewed, uncrewed and autonomous platforms including swarming drones. This will deliver an advanced combat air system capable of fighting in the most hostile environments. The development of novel technologies, and a step change in how we use simulators for mission rehearsal and training, will enable the Royal Air Force to be among the most technologically innovative, productive and lethal air forces in the world."

ACAPS

ACAPS is a non-profit, non-governmental project that provides international, independent humanitarian analysis. Founded in 2009, ACAPS provides daily monitoring and analysis of the situations in 150 countries, to support humanitarian aid workers. This analysis is freely provided to the NGOs, UN agencies and donors. ACAPS is also known for having developed a severity ranking of humanitarian crises. It employs around 30 professionals based in Geneva.
ACAPS established the Syria Needs Analysis Project (SNAP) in 2012. For about three years, SNAP delivered over 40 products related to the humanitarian impact of the conflict.
History.
ACAPS (initially known as "The Assessment Capacities Project”) was established in 2009 to improve the assessment of humanitarian needs in complex emergencies and crises, at a time where there were no single approach, nor consensus on needs assessments and where evidence- and needs-based approaches were not standard. It was created by a consortium of three INGOs: HelpAge International, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Merlin, which then merged with Save the Children.
Through the development of methodological tools, the delivery of training and operational support (such as Bangladesh in 2012 and Nepal Earthquake in 2015) ACAPS contributed to shape norms and standards around coordinated needs assessment and advocated for more meaningful and evidence-based data.
ACAPS was a contributor to the MIRA process (Multi-Cluster/Sector Initial Rapid Assessment) which is a joint needs assessment tool that can be used in sudden-onset emergencies.
Between December 2012 and 30 June 2015 ACAPS and MapAction ran the Strategic Needs Analysis Project — SNAP (initially the Syria Needs Analysis Project). The aim was to support the humanitarian response in Syria and the region with independent analysis and coordinated assessments. For almost three years, SNAP pursued these goals with a combination of independent information products, technical support and capacity building for humanitarian assessments. Its data and products were broadly used by humanitarian workers and also journalists, such as BBC and the "New York Times".
After the SNAP project ACAPS ran several other field projects, such as the Ebola Needs Assessment Project (ENAP) in 2014-2015, the Refugee/Migrant Crisis in 2015-2016 , together with MapAction, the Caribbean response to the Hurricane Irma and Maria, and more recently the support to the Rohingya crisis.
In 2014 ACAPS together with the Emergency Capacity Building Project (ECB) launched "Humanitarian Needs Assessment — The Good Enough Guide ”, a tool dedicated to ease field staff carrying out assessment after a humanitarian crisis. This guide received praise for enabling field-based staff and national responders ‘to provide the critical information needed to inform the wider humanitarian community.”
In 2016 ACAPS, together with six other INGOs, joined the Mixed Migration platform (MMP), a joint NGO initiative providing quality mixed migration-related information for policy, programming and advocacy work, as well as critical information for people on the move. ACAPS contributes to the MMP with analytical capacity, scenario-building expertise, and online data collection and analysis.
Over the years, ACAPS centred its core services on humanitarian analysis and the provision of secondary data. Although ACAPS still undertakes and supports field needs assessments (and primary data collection) and produce needs assessment tools, the majority of its work is dedicated to support the humanitarian community by providing up-to-date information on more than 40 key crises around the globe. The ACAPS website, and its related app, CrisisAlert, released in 2017, are the main platforms to present this analysis to the humanitarian community.
At the recent World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, "joint and impartial needs assessments” were promoted as one of the 10 key commitments of the Grand Bargain giving ACAPS new opportunities to play a central role and contribute to change the humanitarian sector.
Activities.
Crisis analysis.
ACAPS performs crisis analysis, monitoring and updating current crises on a daily basis. They rank the severity of world humanitarian crises on a weekly basis. Tailored reports, such as the Briefing Notes for the START Fund, are also released. 
Forecasting.
Since 2015 ACAPS has developed a range of products and services to better anticipate events and humanitarian developments. These services should contribute to inform timely contingency planning and preparedness measures. ACAPS writes risks reports, anticipatory briefing notes and organizes scenario building workshops, such as the one for IFRC, held in April 2017. The result of this exercise is a report with a set of key scenarios including an overview of events that could trigger the scenario, humanitarian consequences and impact, estimated caseload, operational constraints and recommended actions. Every year, in December, ACAPS releases its annual publication, the "Humanitarian Overview”, identifying key crises and corresponding needs to look at in the upcoming year.
Methodology development.
ACAPS has developed material around humanitarian assessments and analysis, which ranges from decision-making to initial planning of analysis work. The importance of better collecting secondary data (instead of only collecting primary data) and the importance of better analysing fewer data rather than compiling a maximum of information without making sense of it are some of the changes ACAPS made into the humanitarian system. ACAPS is also known for having developed a severity ranking of humanitarian crises. Categories are: severe humanitarian crises, humanitarian crises and situation of concern. This ranking is based on 5 indicators.
More than 100 methodological tools and guidance have been produced by ACAPS.
API/webservices.
ACAPS is currently openly sharing its data with various organizations, through an API service. Among them, the Crises App from ReliefWeb uses the ACAPS "Crisis Overview” section for each crisis displayed on its own app.
Funding.
Since its launch ACAPS has been funded by various institutional donors. The project is currently funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).

Dallara P217

The Dallara P217 is a sportscar prototype built by Dallara Automobili to the 2017 FIA/ACO regulations for the Le Mans Prototype LMP2 class. The car also meets the regulations for the Le Mans Prototype 2 Class of the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship. It was active in the FIA World Endurance Championship, and the European Le Mans Series. The prototype made its debut at the 2017 4 Hours of Silverstone.
Development.
The car is a result of the bid made by Dallara, for one of the four licenses to build the new for 2017 Le Mans Prototype 2 cars. It is also the first LMP constructed by Dallara since the original Audi R18 TDI. The car was first spotted testing at the Autodromo Riccardo Paletti in Northern Italy in late early October, by the Italian magazine Autosprint. 
During the 2017 racing season, the car was discovered to have a fundamental issue with a critical element of the sprint kit which was firmly homologated and carried over in the Le Mans low-drag kit. Resulting in major balance issues for the car which first surfaced at Le Mans. With the car being noted for its speed on the long straights, such as the Mulsanne Straight, but also for its lack of pace in the twistier sections of the track. This element was later revealed to be the splitter. The car was subsequently fitted with an Evo kit for the 2018 racing season to resolve issues with the car. With a new splitter for the Standard High Downforce Aero package and a revised Le Mans Low Drag Kit. Ahead of the homologation of the Evo Package, the revised car was revealed to have undergone testing at the Algarve International Circuit, in the hands of customer team Cetilar Villorba Corse. The car has also been known for its relative similarity to the Porsche 919 Hybrid.
Cadillac DPi-V.R.
A Daytona Prototype International variant of the car, has been developed in partnership with General Motors (under its Cadillac marque), as well as Wayne Taylor Racing. It was unveiled on the 30th of November and is a successor to the successful Corvette Daytona Prototype that was fielded in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, as well as the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar Championship. It is powered by a LS based GM small-block engine, originally a 6.2L V8 designed, developed, and produced by ECR Engines, mated to a 6 Speed Xtrac transmission, producing 600 hp. In this guise, the car was extremely dominant, with the car winning on its debut at the 2017 Rolex 24 at Daytona, where Wayne Taylor Racing leading a 1-2 with Action Express Racing, while also winning 8 of the 10 races in the calendar. In 2018, the displacement of the LS engine was changed to 5.5L, again built by ECR Engines and producing 580 hp, following a series of BoP adjustments during 2017 to slow down the car the previous season, that had made the car hard to drive, with most notably a tall first and second gear mandated after the low-end torque became an advantage against the turbocharged four and six-cylinder engines.

Guardiao (P511)

The Guardiao is the Cape Verde Coast Guard's first patrol vessel based on the Damen Stan 5009 design.
The "Guardião" is equipped with a vertically aligned "axe bow". Damen asserts that a vertical bow has an advantage over a traditional clipper bow, when piercing waves. The clipper bow has more buoyancy, when it pierces a wave, which causes the bow to rise and fall with greater intensity—which triggers seasickness in susceptible individuals. The "Guardião" was the first patrol vessel built to a Damen axe-bow design to be launched.
Her crew of 18 either have their own cabin, or share a double cabin.
The "Guardião" is equipped with a stern launching ramp, allowing it to deploy and retrieve a 7 metre high-speed daughter craft, without first coming to a stop.
The "Guardião" is equipped with facility for the short-term seating of up to 76 individuals, in the case of at-sea-rescues, or the interception of undocumented migrants.
operational history.
In 2016 the "Guardião" participated in a joint exercise wth US and Belgian vessels.

Alan B. Tayler

Alan Breach Tayler (1931–1995) was a British applied mathematician and pioneer of "industrial mathematics". He was a Founding Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford (1959-1995), the initiator of the Oxford Study Groups with Industry in 1968 (which developed into the European Study Groups with Industry), a driving force behind the foundation of the European Consortium for Mathematics in Industry (ECMI) in 1985 and President of ECMI (1989), and the first Director of the Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (OCIAM) (1989-1994).
Personal life.
Alan Tayler was born in Mitcham, Surrey on 5 September 1931 and died in Ducklington, Oxfordshire on 29 January 1995. In 1955 he married June Earp and they had four daughters, one of whom pre-deceased him.
Education.
Alan Tayler was a scholar at King's College School, Wimbledon, London. Then we went up to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1951 where he gained a First in Mathematics and then, after a brief period in industry, a DPhil on "Problems in Compressible Flow" under the supervision of Professor George Temple in 1959.
Career.
Alan Tayler was a distinguished applied mathematician who made important contributions in a wide range of areas (notably lubrication theory, surface gravity waves and viscous dissipation), but his key contribution to science was as the driving force behind the establishment of what is often called "mathematics-in-industry" or "industrial mathematics" (i.e. the application of mathematical approaches to the modeling and analysis of a wide range of real-world problems) as a recognized scientific discipline in its own right. His philosophy is perfectly exemplified by the Oxford (now European) Study Groups with Industry which he and Professor Leslie Fox created in 1968 and are still going strong today. His approach to mathematical modelling is described in his seminal monograph "Mathematical Models in Applied Mechanics" (Oxford University Press, 1986), and is commemorated by the annual Alan Tayler Lecture held at the St Catherine's College, Oxford in November each year. During his career he supervised the DPhil research of several notable applied mathematicians, including Professor John Ockendon FRS and Professor John King.
In 1959 Alan Tayler became a University Lecturer and Tutorial Fellow at St Catherine’s Society, Oxford, and was involved in its transformation into St Catherine’s College, Oxford in 1962, where remained for the rest of his career. He was devoted to the College, and held several of its major offices, and also to the Oxford University Rugby Football Club, of which he was President (1990-1995).
Other work.
He was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1964-1983 and was the Vice-chairman of the Governors from 1972-1981.
Awards.
In 1982 Alan Tayler was jointly awarded (with Professor Sir James Lighthill, FRS) the Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) for his services to applied mathematics, and in 1993 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993 for his services to applied science and industry.

Hadriwa (Bavarian Forest, Haibach)

The Hadriwa [Hádriwɐ] is a completely forested mountain, 922 m, near Elisabethszell in the municipality of Haibach in the Bavarian Forest in Germany. It is the highest point on the ridge between the Klinglbach and Grüner Bach in the east and the Elisabethszeller Bach and the Menach and its side streams in the west.
According to a survey, the Hadriwa is one of 16 possible top sites for pumped-storage hydroelectric stations in Bavaria. In Straubing-Bogen county, the Pfarrerberg to the south and the Kobelberg near Wiesenfelden are also among the sites deemed suitable for such installations.
Until the early 20th century, there was a farmstead near the summit, also called the Hadriwa. Today its traces are still visible in the form of the remains of a building and well-preserved rubble stone walls.
The origin of the name is unclear. One possible meaning is based on the Czech word, "Hadr", for disagreement, quarrel, strife and the fact that the boundary between the abbeys of Oberalteich and Windberg passed through this area. Another possibility is that it relates to a Czech word, "Had", for snake.
There is another mountain called the Hadriwa (677 m) in the Bavarian Forest in the municipality of Zell in the county of Cham.

R. A. Hardie

Robert Alexander Hardie (; June 11, 1865 – June 30, 1949) was a Canadian physician and Methodist evangelist who for 45 years served as a missionary in Korea. He is recognized as the catalyst for the Wŏnsan Revival (1903) and also inspired the Great Pyongyang Revival (1907) in what is now North Korea.
Early life and education.
Hardie was born on June 11, 1865, in Haldimand County, Ontario, south of Toronto. Of Scottish descent, he was the first of six children born to James and Abigail Hardie. Both his parents died before he was ten years old. Hardie was then raised by his aunt and uncle, Thomas and Fannie Shaw. He attended a school in Seneca, Haldimand County, earning a teacher's certificate in 1884, and worked as a teacher in Seneca for two years.
In 1886, Hardie enrolled at the Toronto School of Medicine. On December 27, 1886, he married Margaret "Matilda" Kelly of Hamilton, Ontario. As a medical student, Hardie studied under Oliver R. Avison, who later travelled to Korea as an evangelist. Hardie graduated from University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1890.
Career.
Physician to missionary.
In the summer of 1890, Hardie moved his family to Korea to serve as an independent and nondenominational medical missionary. The Toronto University Medical Student's YMCA (MS–YMCA) had funded his endeavour for the next eight years. For six months in late 1890 and early 1891, Hardie served as a physician in the "Chaejungwon" (Extended Relief House: Royal Hospital) in Seoul. On April 14, 1891, Hardie moved to Pusan and was later joined by his wife Margaret and two daughters at his residence which also served as the location of his medical practice. In 1892, the Hardies briefly moved to Nagasaki, Japan, on account of his poor health; they returned to Pusan later that year.
When Canadian missionary James Scarth Gale ended his association with his supporters from the University College's YMCA (UC–YMCA) in order join the American Presbyterian Mission, the UC–YMCA lost its only representative in Korea. At Hardie's suggestion, the MS–YMCA and UC–YMCA joined forces to form The Canadian Colleges' Mission (CCM) with Hardie as their representative and beneficiary in Korea. However, he faced competition from other missionaries in the Pusan area and financial hardship due to the limited support from Toronto. In November 1892, Hardie decided to move his mission to Wŏnsan, where Gale and Malcolm C. Fenwick were then located. In Wŏnsan, Hardie began to emulate Fenwick's methods for self-sufficiency by supplementing his living with farming, "feeding cattle and growing fruit". The Hardie family stayed in Wŏnsan until 1896.
In July 1896, Hardie relocated his family to Canada, and returned alone to Wŏnsan in October 1897. In 1898, Gale moved to Seoul, and Hardie joined the American Methodist Episcopal Church, South, when his contract of support from the CCM ended. With the American Methodist mission, Hardie was first tasked with establishing a medical practice in Songdo, Hwanghae Province, in present-day North Korea. He remained there for less than a year before relocating again to Seoul in August 1899. It was in Seoul, on November 11, 1900, that Bishop Alpheus Wilson ordained Hardie as a deacon in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.
Revival movements.
Sometime after 1900, Hardie stopped practicing medicine to concentrate on his missionary work. From 1902 to 1909, Hardie was charged with the task of proselytising to the people of Wŏnsan and the greater Kangwon Province. In August 1903, during a Bible study with six other missionaries, Hardie spoke of prayer and the Holy Spirit, confessing his low spirits and disappointment with his efforts to proselytise the Kangwon Province. During later meetings with larger congregations across northern Korea, Hardie made similar confessions that inspired many western missionaries and native Koreans alike to confess their own sins, leading thousands of congregates to accept the missionaries' Christian teachings. From 1901 to 1909, there were almost 100,000 new Korean converts to the Christian faith.
Hardie's confessions became the catalyst for the Wŏnsan Revival which later inspired the Great Pyongyang Revival of 1907 in northern Korea. His expression of the feeling of "humiliation" at his failings in evangelizing people in the Kangwon Province had the paradoxical effect of inspiring a religious awakening that spread throughout the entire nation. Alfred Wasson, an American Methodist missionary to Korea, wrote in "Church Growth in Korea" (1934):
Academic career.
In 1905, Hardie started a mobile theological school named "Sinhakdang" (Hall of Theology). The school initially had no defined physical location as he travelled between Inchŏn, Kongju, Pyongyang, and Seoul to teach several months-long sessions. In 1909, he moved to Seoul and began teaching at the Pierson Memorial Bible School and the Methodist Biblical Institute. In 1913, Hardie founded the "Hyŏpsŏng sinhakkyo" (Union Theological School) in Seoul. He served as the president of the school until 1922 and left the school in June 1923. From 1916, he also published a magazine entitled "Sinak saekye" (The World of Theology). In 1923, Hardie became the editor-in-chief of the "Chosŏn Yesukyo Sŏhoe" (now known as the Korean Christian Literature Society).
Family and later years.
When the Hardies arrived in Korea, they had with them a two-year-old daughter named Eva, their second child. Their first son Arthur Sidney had died as an infant in 1888. Their second daughter Annie Elizabeth was born in Seoul during the first year of their missionary life. The Hardies' third daughter Marie Mabel died only a day old but they had two more daughters, Gertrude Abigail and Sarah Grace, who lived to adulthood. Their seventh child Robert and youngest daughter Margaret Joy died at eleven and six years old, respectively. The Hardie family also adopted a Korean girl named Chuponia.
In 1935, Hardie retired from missionary work and moved with his wife to Lansing, Michigan, to live with their daughter Grace. In total, he had served as a medical and then an evangelical missionary for about 45 years of his life. Margaret died in 1945 and Robert on June 30, 1949.

Kara founded a company in Houston, Texas - E-Stamp Corporation - to bring the concept of PC Postage to the American public after first satisfying the United States Postal Service and its consultants at Carnegie Mellon University that the concept could be implemented without risk to Postal Service revenues.
In March 1998, E-stamp got approval by the U.S. Postal Service for the first product under the IBI Program that was allowed to produce electronic postage using an off-the-shelf PC. In 1998, Salim Kara left E-Stamp Corporation, paving the way for it to publicly trade with a market capitalization exceeding US $1 billion. In 2001, the technology, intellectual property and trade names of E-Stamp were sold to Stamps.com. Following his innovative development of PC Postage, Kara proceeded to develop additional concepts for secure Internet based payment systems operating through Kara Technology and later iMobile Payment, Inc. where he developed additional ordering and payment systems, secure virtual tickets and virtual credit cards. His company’s core technology was approved by BlackBerry and he became a BlackBerry ISV Alliance Member in 2006.

Willington Waggonway

The Willington Waggonway was constructed in 1795 to carry coal from Tyneside mines to the river. It was rediscovered in 2013 during archaeological work being carried out prior to redevelopment of the former Neptune shipyard in Walker due to its proximity to the Roman fort, Segedunum. Well preserved under compacted coal waste was part of the most complete and complex 18th century waggonway ever found.

Naja Salto

Naja Salto (1945–2016) was a Danish painter and textile artist who is remembered for her rich, brightly coloured tapestries, many depicting scenes of the sea and the sky.
Early life, education and family.
Born in Copenhagen on 22 November 1945, Naja Salto was the daughter of the painter and ceramist Axel Johannes Salto (1889–1961) and Gerda Åkesson (1909–92), also a painter and ceramist. She studied textile art at the Arts and Crafts School under Franka Rasmussen (1962–66). She later attended the Danish Theatre School where she studied scenography (1972–76).
With Sven Poulsson, whom she married in June 1967, she had a son, Kasper Salto, who became a furniture designer. The marriage was dissolved in 1969. In December 1989, she married the designer and silversmith Allan Scharff but was divorced in 1995. In June 1995, she married the auctioneer Jens Christian Thygesen.
Career.
Salto began to weave while young, adopting both traditional and experimental techniques after opening her own workshop in 1966. She used increasingly vivid colours, depicting motifs from Nordic mythology as well as the sea. Her interest in scenography was reflected in her modern tapestries, some representing pictorial images, others adapted to church decoration. By the 1990s, she had initiated new approaches to textile art in Denmark. She also created works in stained glass. In later years, she moved from tapestry to painting.
Salto was one of the artists who contributed to Haandarbejdets Fremme (Danish Handcraft Guild) which became the main focus for textile art in Denmark.
Examples of her work can be seen in Holmen's Church, Copenhagen, and the Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense. She created the stage curtain depicting the "Tree of Life" in the National Museum of Denmark. In 2006, her work was exhibited in Kunsten, Aalborg together with that of her father Axel and her son Kasper.
Naja Salto died on 3 March 2016.

Hyperactive (Robert Palmer song)

"Hyperactive" is a song by the English vocalist Robert Palmer, which was released in 1986 as the fourth single from his eighth studio album "Riptide". The song was written by Dennis Nelson, Tony Haynes and Palmer, and produced by Bernard Edwards. Released as the follow-up to his US chart topper "Addicted to Love", "Hyperactive" reached No. 33 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and remained in the charts for twelve weeks.
Release.
"Hyperactive" was released by Island Records on 7" vinyl in the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. A 12" vinyl version was released in Europe, with a promotional-only version also issued in the US. For its release as a single, "Hyperactive" was edited to reduce its duration. The B-side, "Woke Up Laughing", had originally appeared on Palmer's 1980 album "Clues".
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Cash Box" commented: "An aggressive, tough-edged rhythm track [which] should capitalize on Palmer's newfound star status. Danceable and featuring his characteristic soulish vocal, "Hyperactive" has tons of radio appeal." In a retrospective review of "Riptide", Tim DiGravina of AllMusic noted how the album was made up of "mostly rocking songs", with "Hyperactive" "add[ing] a bit of a pop veneer to the formula, with its bright keyboards dating the song to the Miami Vice era; that's not to say it doesn't hold nostalgic charm."

Employee's Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance

The Employee's Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance () is a repealed law of Hong Kong to provide for the rights of employees to representation, consultation and collective bargaining; and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith. It was introduced by trade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan in the colonial Legislative Council on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong in April 1997 but was soon repealed by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in October 1997.
Contents.
The bill was introduced by the pro-labour legislator Lee Cheuk-yan of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU). Under the bill, employees were given rights to representation and consultation through a trade union representative and to be covered by a collective agreement negotiated by a "representative" trade union. A trade union can also request employer recognition if its membership constitutes more than 15 per cent of the employees and represents more than 50 per cent of these employees. Further provisions included the establishment of collective bargaining and the imposition on employers of a duty to allow trade union representatives paid time-off for representation, consultation and collective bargaining activities.
The Labour Department, employers and the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) and the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions (FLU) opposed to the bill, mainly on the grounds that collective bargaining was not a tradition in Hong Kong where employers and labour enjoyed a "harmonious relationship".
The bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 20 June 1997 with the support of the pro-democracy camp in the council. It was gazetted on 30 June 1997, the last day of the colonial rule.
Repeal.
After the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong, the ordinance was first frozen by the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) on 17 July 1997 on the basis of the review of the Labour Advisory Board (LAB), a tripartite body appointed by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. A majority of the LAB members deemed it inappropriate to bring the collective bargaining into operation. It was frozen with three of the six other ordinances passed by the colonial Legislative Council as private members' bills also on the ground that these laws were hastily passed during the last week of the legislature in June 1997 without adequate discussion in bill committees and public consultation.
On 30 October, the ordinance was repealed by the Employment and Labour Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance, along with the Employment (Amendment) (No. 4) Ordinance 1997 passed by the Legislative Council on 29 June 1997.
It has become the subject of the labour issue in Hong Kong, in which the pro-democrats used it as an attack on the FTU which supported the repeal of the collective bargaining.

Odyssey Cinema, St Albans

The Odyssey Cinema is a film theatre in the town of St Albans, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom. It is a locally listed Art Deco building, located on London Road, around east of St Albans Cathedral. Originally built in 1931 as the Capitol Cinema, the current building stands on the site of an earlier film theatre, the Alpha Picture Palace. This former cinema was of particular historical significance as it was opened in 1904 by the film-making pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper and is considered to have been the first cinema in Hertfordshire.
History.
Arthur Melbourne Cooper was born in St Albans in 1874 at 99 London Road. As a teenager, he was inspired to go into the new art of moving photography when he became acquainted with Birt Acres, and he became a noted figure in the history of early cinema as a pioneering filmmaker. Cooper founded his Alpha Trading Company in 1906 to make short films, animations and newsreels. He set up the Alpha Production Works in Bedford Park Road, later moving to larger premises at Alma Road. Among the pioneering films he shot in St Albans was the animated fantasy, "Dreams of Toyland" (1908).
Cooper wanted to establish a film theatre to present his productions to the paying public, and acquired a public hall building on London Road that had originally been designed for a social institute in 1903 by the local architect Percival Blow (1873–1939). On 27 July 1908, Cooper opened the Alpha Picture House, Hertfordshire's first permanent cinema. The building was fitted out with a restaurant, swimming pool and hairdressing salon as well as the 800 seat cinema. The cinema failed inspection following the passing of the 1910 Cinematograph Act and was sold through liquidation to George Arthur Dawson the following year. The cinema continued to run as the Poly until 1926 and was destroyed by fire the following year.
In 1911, Cooper sold his studios and the London Road cinema. It changed hands several times, taking on different names. In 1918, it became the Poly Picture Palace. In 1923, the cinema underwent another refurbishment by Percival Blow, which involved the installation of a balcony with boxes and a cinema organ, and a dance hall and workshop in the basement. From 1926 it was known as The Regent Picture House.
On 15 December 1927 The Regent was gutted by a large fire caused by a dropped cigarette. Plans were drawn up the following year to erect a replacement cinema and a new building was designed by Percival Blow and James Martin Hatfield with internal decorations designed by Robert Cromie. The new cinema featured a seating capacity of 1,620 with a 20-foot-deep stage, a two-manual Compton theatre organ, a café and dressing rooms. Because of the sloping site, patrons entered the cinema at balcony level and ten descended to the stalls. Now called The Capitol Cinema, it opened to the public on 3 December 1931.
In 1932, the Capitol was sold again, this time to the D.J. James Cinema Circuit, and in 1934 the cinema underwent a major extension and refurbishment by the architect firm Kemp &amp; Tasker, expanding the seating capacity to 1,728. The cinema changed hands again in 1937, when D.J. James was bought by Eastern Cinemas, part of the General Cinema Finance (GCF) group, and in 1943, GCF was in turn taken over by the Rank Organisation, who rebranded the Capitol under their Odeon Cinema Circuit name on 1 January 1945.
On 30 October 1963, The Rolling Stones along with The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley, Little Richard and Julie Grant appeared at the cinema. 
Despite the increasing attraction of television in the 1950s and 60s, the St Albans Odeon continued to run a successful business, showing new Cinemascope films to attract audiences. Audiences declined in the 1970s, and the Odeon was divided into three smaller screens in 1973. It re-opened on 21 January with a screening of "A Clockwork Orange" in Screen 1.
Closure.
By the 1990s, cinema chains had shifted their focus to large, out-of-town multiplexes and divested themselves of smaller town cinemas. With the opening of the new cinema complex at Jarman Park in Hemel Hempstead in 1995, Rank decided to close the St Albans Odeon. Despite the efforts of a local campaign to save the cinema, it closed to the public on 20 August 1995. The last film screened was "Waterworld". After closure, the building was stripped of its fixtures and fittings.
Re-opening.
The building was derelict for many years. It was purchased by a property developer who proposed demolishing it to make way for flats. A campaign to preserve the cinema by the local civic society failed to garner support from St Albans City and District Council, who voted to have the cinema demolished. One local councilor was quoted as saying "nobody wanted it back as a cinema" and dismissed claims about the cinema's history as "cod history",
In November 2009, the old cinema building was purchased by local entrepreneur James Hannaway, with a plan to refurbish and re-open it as a cinema. Hannaway had previously led a project to re-open another historic Art Deco cinema, The Rex, Berkhamsted, around west of St Albans. A fundraising campaign was started to restore the cinema to its original 1930s glory and a new name – "The Odyssey" – was chosen following a public competition. It was named after "", in honour of director Stanley Kubrick, who had family connections with St Albans. Restoration work began in 2013 and the cinema re-opened to the public on 30 November 2014 as an independent, single-screen, arthouse cinema with seating for 500 and a café and bar.
Architecture.
The building is noted for its Art Deco styling.

Synopsis.
Act I.
The musical opens with Anna Mae Bullock's childhood in Nutbush Tennessee, where she sings exuberantly in the community church despite her mother Zelma's embarrassment at her loudness ("Nutbush City Limits"). Anna Mae's parents have a difficult relationship, which culminates in Zelma walking out with her eldest daughter Alline, leaving Anna Mae to be brought up by her grandmother, Gran Georgeanna.
Some years later, Anna Mae is invited to join Zelma and Alline in St Louis, and she goes with Gran Georgeanna's encouragement ("Don't Turn Around"). In St Louis, Alline introduces Anna Mae to the night life ("Shake a Tail Feather"), eventually crossing paths with Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm ("The Hunter"). One night Anna Mae joins Ike on stage to sing ("Matchbox"), and the success of the performance leads Ike to ask Zelma for permission for Anna Mae to join his band ("It's Gonna Work Out Fine").
Ike gives Anna Mae the stage name "Tina Turner" despite her protests. Although Tina enjoys performing with him, she's aware of Ike's vicious temper ("A Fool in Love"), and has to hide her love affair with Raymond, a member of Ike's band ("Let's Stay Together"). After touring successfully for some time, Ike asks Tina to marry him, since people already think they are because of her stage name. Tina agrees, despite being pregnant with Raymond's child; in response, Raymond leaves her ("Better Be Good to Me"). Tina keeps performing with Ike and his band, through Ike's infidelities, violence, and demands of Tina's health despite her having another child ("I Want to Take You Higher"). Ike's road manager, Rhonda Graam, advises Tina to leave him, but she refuses.
Ike gets a recording deal with Phil Spector, but is angered when he wants to record Tina solo ("River Deep Mountain High"). Ike is dismissive of Tina's ability as a solo artist, and during an argument attempts to hit her son, Craig. Tina almost walks out, but Ike apologises and begs her forgiveness ("Be Tender with Me Baby"). Tina overdoses and is sent to hospital, but is forced to check out for a performance ("Proud Mary"). Backstage, Tina and Ike get into another violent fight, which is the final straw and causes Tina to run away. Bruised and bleeding, she asks a hotel clerk for a room to stay, using only her stage name as a promise to pay later since she doesn't have any money ("I Don't Wanna Fight").
Act II.
Tina, free from Ike, has been performing in Las Vegas with the help of Rhonda, now her manager. They're struggling to make ends meet because no record label wants to sign a black woman who's nearing forty years old, and Ike has claimed copyright over all songs from the "Ike &amp; Tina Revue", preventing her from singing the songs she's known for ("Private Dancer"). While dropping off a demo tape at Capitol Records, they meet Roger Davies, a young Australian music producer who's a fan of Tina. Roger goes to Vegas to watch Tina perform ("Disco Inferno") and afterward asks to be her manager. Rhonda is upset about being put aside, but Tina insists that she needs to try something new, and that she needs Rhonda more as a sister than a manager ("Open Arms").
Tina travels to London for Roger's recording session. Among the people she meets is Erwin Bach, a German music executive. Tina wants to reinvent herself and transition to rock and roll, but she struggles with Roger's advice, and dreams of Ike watching her ("I Can't Stand the Rain"). Erwin visits her hotel room to provide comfort, and the pair kiss.
While preparing a performance showcase for the record label, Tina rails against Roger's instructions, refusing to be anyone's puppet any longer. Tina asks everyone to leave, and performs her Buddhist mantra to calm herself. She has a vision of her younger self and Gran Georgeanna encouraging her ("Tonight"). The showcase is a success, but the record label still refuses to sign her out of racism. Roger decides to promote her himself through touring performances back in the United States. Erwin asks her to stay in London and declares his love for her, but she rejects him. Tina's performance of the new material is a success ("What's Love Got to Do with It?"). Capitol Records begs her to sign with them, and she agrees only on her own terms.
Alline arrives with news Zelma is dying. Tina visits Zelma at the hospital, where Ike has been visiting Zelma as well. Zelma encourages them to reconcile; Tina demands that Ike apologise, but he can't and leaves. Zelma and Tina have an emotional confrontation, after which Zelma dies. Tina and Alline mourn their mother ("We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)").
Riding high, Tina prepares for a concert before 180,000 people in Brazil. Erwin arrives, having flown over to be with her. The pair reconcile, which leads into Tina's walking on stage for the concert ("The Best"). For the finale and encore, Tina and her band perform reprises of "Nutbush City Limits" and "Proud Mary".
Critical reception.
The musical received generally positive reviews from the critics, with particular praise reserved for Adrienne Warren in the title role as Tina Turner. Michael Billington of "The Guardian" described the "whirlwind performance" of Warren as "astonishing", and concluded on the production: "As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets." Similarly Dominic Cavendish of "The Daily Telegraph" described Warren's performance as a "tour de force" and considered the show "slickly choreographed, beautifully designed and roof-raisingly well-sung". Adam Mattera in "Echoes" noted "the production plays fast and loose with catalogue chronology... it's a crowd-pleasing decision meaning all the solo mega-hits aren't squeezed into the final act, but simultaneously it derails the dramatic reveal of Tina's 80s rock'n'roll reinvention," while concluding "it's so resounding joyous you don't care."
Will Gompertz of the BBC criticised the script as "rather disappointingly two-dimensional", but thought the musical "elegantly staged" with Warren a "24-carat, all singing, all dancing, bona fide star". Stephen Dalton of "The Hollywood Reporter" noted that while its grand finale contains "stilted, corny elements", "the production becomes a full-blooded rock show that is "roof-raising" and "life-affirming", with a climax that "swept the crowd to its feet. Pure button-pushing melodrama, maybe. But irresistibly uplifting entertainment, too."

La Raíz

La Raíz are a Spanish band from Gandia (Valencia), Spain. They perform a mixture of rock, ska, reggae and rap. This kind of music is also known as "rockstizaje". The band is made up of eleven musicians from different backgrounds and musical styles, with a great impact and strong verses in each of their songs. Their music is also known as a movement of intervention.
History.
La Raíz, as it is known nowadays, was formed in 2006, after the split-up of a former band also called La Raíz in which Edu, the current guitarist, was in. However, their music style was completely different. Since then, their intention was to create a big band with their friends, who were not necessarily musicians.
"El aire muerto" was the first demo that was released in 2007 and with which they started to know each other, looking for new styles and representing political rap and "mestizaje". With this new and important perspective, Josep Panxo joins them, bringing them closer to a social movement. Later, Felipe joins the band on the drums and Julio Maloa as a lead singer. All of them established a qualitative change, laying the foundations of their model band, Hechos Contra el Decoro.
They self-produced their first work "El aire muerto". In 2009, after releasing a song together with the Valencian band La Gossa Sorda, and receiving good reviews online, they started self-producing their new album called "Guerra al silencio", a mixture of rock, reggae and ska. In September 2008, they recorded "Raíces" with La Gossa Sorda, a "budding" song that ended up being the beginning of the "Guerra al Silencio", their first real album, in 2009. The group moves to sending a stronger and more committed message. Pablo moves from the guitar to lead vocals, and the arrival of Jim (with a rocker style) to the guitar. With these changes, they ended up laying the foundations of the group, as we know it today. In addition, a close friend of the band, Sen-K, joins the 3 voices that were already in the band (Pablo, Josep and Julio).
After two summers on tour with this album, they decided to include DJ Jano in the band. Carles joins on the trumpet and Xavi on the trombone as well. In 2011, they're recording "El lado de los Rebeldes". Second band album, first studio album, recorded by the German producer Uwe Hoffmann. On this, they show their rocker and festive side, which is perfectly captured in live shows.
Between December 2012 and January 2013, they recorded their latest work, "Así en el cielo como en la selva", at the RPM studios in Almàssera, with Roger García. It is an album with a greater musical and lyrical maturity, with which they remain faithful to their group of followers, and with which they continue to make the audiences who receive them dance and sing along in the new places they visit.
In 2013, they would once again exceed 40 concerts. In 2014, "Jilgueros Tour" took them around Europe. Meanwhile, they are already among the top bands in almost all the festivals in which they play in Spain. They went on a short tour of only 20 concerts in 2015 so that they could save money to finance their new album that would be released in 2016.
They released "Entre poetas y presos" in March 2016. This album includes 11 tracks that defend the dignity of memory, the identity of those who have been silenced, the obsolescence of some institutions such as the monarchy, and a cry to the bonfire of the continents with a crafted language and charged with rock. This new album could be downloaded for free through their website. This was a gesture of support with the organization Defender a quien defiende ("Defending who defends"), based in Barcelona in the NOVACT (Instituto Internacional por la Acción No Violenta). It encourages collective responses against measures such as the Spanish Ley Mordaza (Gag Law). Fifty percent of the album's earnings were sent to this organization. Likewise, the physical copy of the album was in the top 20 most sold CDs in Spain for several weeks. This year, the band sold out its tickets not only in Spain, but also in Europe. This was the first time they played out of Europe during their visit to Nepal.
In 2017, the band announced the "La hoguera de los continentes" ("The bonfire of the continents") tour, consolidating its international presence with Argentina and Chile as the first dates of the tour. Other cities and countries were also included, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Dublin, Rome, Lisbon, Porto, Poland, Mexico and Colombia. In addition, they ended the tour in Palacio Vistalegre. They released a recording of the concert.
On 14 December 2017, the band announced that 2018 would be their farewell.
On 2 February 2018, the live album was released, called "Nos volveremos a ver" ("We'll Meet Again").

Valentin Ștefan

Valentin "Vali" Ștefan (born 25 June 1967) is a Romanian former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.
Club career.
Vali Ștefan grew up at Dunărea Galați, for which he also played its first matches at senior level, but the Liga I debut was only on 24 May 1992 for Oțelul Galați, in a 0-1 defeat against FCM Bacău. He played 186 matches in the first league of Romania, most of them for Oțelul Galați, being also the captain of the club in the 1990s and a legend of the red, white and blue side.
Captain of a generation, considered by many supporters to be the most beautiful in Oțelul's history, with players such as: Cătălin Tofan, Costin Maleș, Tudorel Pelin, Viorel Tănase, Gigi Ion or Viorel Ion, Ștefan surprised many fans by the fact that, despite he was a defensive profile player, scored a lot of goals, many of them decisive for "the Steelworkers". As a matter of fact, he was the first player who fight for the Liga I top scorer award, as the player of Oțelul. In the 1997–98 season, Vali Ştefan was the 4th in the table, with 14 goals scored. In the 2011 IFFHS top of the best defensive profile scorers in the history of football, Ștefan was on the 63rd place, over players like: Fernando Hierro, Laurent Blanc, Roberto Carlos or Franz Beckenbauer. As proof of attachment the fans even made him a song, which began with the phrase: "Vali Ştefan-căpitan, ca Baresi la Milan!" ("Vali Ştefan-captain, like Baresi at Milan!").
He also played for CSM Reșița and outside Romania in Cyprus, for Omonia and Anagennisi Deryneia.
International career.
Valentin Ștefan played in 1 match for Romania, an 8-1 victory against Liechtenstein and in 24 matches for Romania B, where he also scored a goal.
After retirement.
Valentin Ștefan retired in 2000 and for a period he was the vice-president of Oțelul Galați, then in 2006 he left Romania and moved in Cyprus where he works as baker and football coach.
In 2014 on the occasion of the Oțelul's 50th anniversary he was included by the "Dunărea Bătrăna" publication in the top 50 legends of Oțelul, together with his 1990s teammates.
In 2016 he became a "socios" member of Oțelul.
On 16 July 2018 he was named as the general manager of Oțelul Galați.
Manager career.
As a football coach, Vali Ștefan worked for Omonia U-17 and Olympiakos Nicosia U-17 squads. He won two U-17 national titles, one with each team and with Olympiakos U-17, also a second league title. From 2015 until 2018 he was the manager of Omonia U-21.

Thames Sailing Barge Match

The Thames Sailing Barge Match is the second oldest sailing race in the world, beaten only by the America's Cup. It starts off Stanford-le-Hope and finishes off the Three Daws public house in Gravesend on the London River (River Thames) and is open to spritsail rigged Thames sailing barges, it uses the same course and rules as were used in the first match in 1863.
The first matches.
The swim-headed barge ( the swimmie) was convenient for river work, slow to windward, fast off the wind but performing abysmally in heavy weather in the seaway. In the 1840s the swim head gave way to the rounded bow that was soon replaced by a straight stem (the stemmie). Competition from the railways was causing barge builders to experiment.
"The Golden Dustman", William Henry Dodd, organised the first race in 1863, giving cash prizes for the first barges in the stumpie and topsail classes. The second race in 1864 attracted 40 barges. Of the 16 stumpies and the 22 topsail barges entering in 1865, six were still in service in 1931. They sailed from Erith to The Nore and back in 5hr 47min and 5hr 14min.
The Stumpies commonly raced at this time with a bowsprit. The owner of the leading 1867 stumpies, Lee, painted Invicta, the white horse of Kent on his black mainsails
The races were to induce the barge owners to improve the standard of equipment, and raise the status of the crews. 
The public chartered special steamers to watch matches, and soon after, barge owners were commissioning barges with racing lines.

Horké léto

Horké léto (Hot Summer) is a point and click video game. Developed by Czech studio Maxon, it was published in 1998 by JRC Interactive. A sequel, entitled Horké léto 2, was developed by Centauri Production and published in 1999 by JRC Interactive. A third game "Žhavé léto 3 ½" is an action/adventure/driving game developed by Centauri Production and CINEMAX, published by Akella in 2006, which although unable to use the characters and titles of the first two games was related and rounded off what was effectively a trilogy. "Žhavé léto 3 ½" was published in English, Spanish, French and German as Evil Days of Luckless John and in Russian as "Сорвать Куш".
Production.
The graphics for the video game were created by Marek Píša. Píša and Viktor Bocan also participated in the screenplay writing. Sound and music were created by William Foldes. Most characters, excluding some female ones, were voiced by comedian Zdeněk Izer, a notable Czech impersonator. The game shares a humorous style that can seen across several Czech adventures, such as "Polda". "Horké léto" was the first Czech game with professional dubbing. The game's most famous quote comes in its opening scene: "I am an ordinary kid. Guys call me Rambo and girls [call me] asshole. Otherwise, I'm Majer. Honza Majer". Like many other domestic video games of the era, "Horke Leto" was intended to appeal directly to Czech and Slovak players. The game became a phenomenon upon its release and it immediately ranked among the most popular Czech adventures. In 2003, however, Petr Ticháček wrote that the fan base of the game had heavily diminished.
Sequels.
According to Miroslav Mrňa, the idea of a sequel was brought up by JRC, an exclusive distributor for the first game. The developers found the proposition interesting and decided to pursue it. Initial work on the sequel began in late December 1998. The team consisted of one scriptwriter, two programmers, three graphic artists and two musicians. Mrna described the development and production process of the game in detail for iDNES.cz. A watercolour-style design was used for the backgrounds of "Horke Leto 2"; it was painted by hand and then scanned into a computer. The images were inspired by the works of painter Jan Štěpánek. By mid-November, the game was expected to be released in time for the Christmas season. The game was planned to be released around the same time as "Polda 2" and there was a friendly rivalry between the two titles. "Horke Leto 2" caught the attention of Bonusweb during development, who devoted a considerable amount of airtime to the game. This included a series of news articles where they observed the game's development; gave a preview and review; provided a tutorial; published an interview with project leader Miroslav Mrňa and finally gave away a demo. IDEA Games completed a conversion of the game for iOS and Android platforms in 2012; players could access a 30-minute episode before having to pay in order to complete the rest of the adventure. The game was re-released with updated graphics.
While developers from Centauri Production wanted to create a second sequel to the game, they were unable to obtain the rights for the name "Horke Leto" or the main character Honza. The original title for the third in the series was intended to be "Raiders of the Lost Casino", but this was only used for international distribution purposes. In May 2005, the third title was announced as being prepared for release in the third quarter of that year. Subsequently, the game was scheduled to be released in the first few weeks of 2006. This was later pushed to February that year. Akella demonstrated the game as a work-in-progress at E3 2006. Akella planned an English release for the end of 2006. A French version was made and released 24 August 2007. The game's visual style is both cartoon-like and gritty.
Plot and gameplay.
In "Horké léto" the player takes control of teenager Honza Majer, who must rescue his family after they are captured by cannibals. In "Horké léto 2", Honza Majer must retrieve an artifact—the Purple Salamander—from the bandit, One-Eye Dingo. "Žhavé léto 3 ½" sees the player take control of Honza's grandfather, the hapless protagonist Johnny Majer, who must compete with the Mafia in the age of the prohibition. Set in the gangster age of the 1930s, the player takes control of the handsome street rat Johnny who inherits a casino, only to discover that there is a plot to take it off him.
The first two games are point and click adventures controlled by the mouse. The third is mainly a point and click adventure with elements of stealth, fighting, driving, and shoot ‘em up.
Critical reception.
Horké léto.
"Refresher.cz" deemed "Horké léto" an average game, but noted that it didn't stop the game from becoming a domestic hit. "Doupe.cz" wrote that the game was one of the best Czech adventures, one that every gamer should play. "Excalibur" stated that while the graphics and gameplay were nothing special, it was the dubbing into local languages that captured the imagination of Czecheslovakia. "PC Tuning" deemed it one of the 10 best Czech games of all time. "Refresher" thought it was the 20th best Czech title, praising the game's amusing dialogues and first-class dubbing.
Horké léto 2.
In a preview, "Bonusweb" hoped that the game's humour would outweigh its average graphics and animations making it an above-average Czech title. "Bonusweb.cz" compared the title to Polda 2, and ultimately decided that despite its limitations it was worth a play.
Evil Days of Luckless John.
"Evil Days of Luckless John (Žhavé léto 3 ½)" received mixed reviews from critics who enjoyed the game's artistic style and story but disliked its gameplay and interface. "Hexus" disliked the clunky interface, though the review praised the game's graphics. "Adventure Classic Gaming" felt the game was a disappointing attempt to recapture the classic point and click adventures of the late 20th century. "Adventures Planet" noted the strange mix of genres, that saw arcade-style gameplay be followed by "Myst"-style puzzles. Bonusweb felt that despite the game's limitations, it was genuinely surprising. Game Watcher deemed the title "pretty poor". "Game Slave" found "John" to be a great idea that was poorly executed. "4 Players" felt a lot of the humour fell flat. "Jeux Video" described the game as a funny and endearing experience. "Adventure Treff" felt the game was more likely to induce annoyance than fun. "PC Guru" thought the game was fun despite its graphics. "Bonusweb" compared the game favorably to "Polda 5". "Tiscalo" felt the game's screenshots were reminiscent of "Full Throttle".

Frank Prosser Bowden

Frank Prosser Bowden (August 1860 – 28 May 1934) was a senior public servant, initially with the Tasmanian Post Office and following Federation, the federal Postmaster-General's Department. He was heavily involved in the development of Tasmania's telegraphy and telephony networks, and subsequently their integration into those of the Commonwealth. Notable for his participation with William Philpot Hallam's early wireless radio experiments.
Early life and family.
Bowden was born at Launceston in August, 1860, a son of the late John Gibson Bowden. He spent by far the greater portion of his life at Hobart, for his family removed from Launceston and came to the capital of Tasmania when he was six months old and he was at Hobart ever since. He received his education at private schools. In the first place he attended a school kept by a Mr. Cairnduff (popularly known as "Plummy") in Brisbane-street, and afterwards was a scholar at Mr. E. D. Oldfield's Academy at the corner of Argyle and Brisbane streets in those days.
At 12½ years of age he said good-bye to school, and made his first venture in the business world at Fletcher's stationery warehouse, then situated in Liverpool St, next to Mr. R. A. Mather's establishment. "Young Bowden," as he then was styled, left the stationery business in order to enter the postal service — and there found his niche. 
He was married in 1891, at Port Cygnet. In 1925 his wife had passed some years prior. He had three sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Eric Bowden, was an equipment engineer in the Postmaster-General's Department at Hobart and went on to become the Tasmanian Wireless Inspector. Frank Philip Bowden, his second son, was taking his B.Sc. degree in 1925, and was demonstrator in physics at the Tasmanian University, and the third son. Mr. J. G. Bowden, was associated with the electrical firm of Messrs. Medhurst and Sons.
Professional career.
Bowden took up the duties of telegraph messenger on 1 April 1875, the telegraph department at that time being a separate branch of the post office. Fred A. Packer was Superintendent of Telegraphs at the time, with J. J. Macdonald the chief operator. Morse recorders were then in use, he explained, either "embossers" or "inkers," and the received telegrams were transcribed at sight from the tape by hand on to the forms for delivery. Various systems were adopted subsequently. At first the recorders were replaced by sounders, messages received being taken by sound. That was followed by the duplex system, worked two ways, two messages being simultaneously received and sent on the one wire. The successor to this system was the quadruplex system, which enabled four messages — two sent and two received — to pass on one wire at the same time. The next development was the introduction of the Wheatstone automatic duplex system. This was run on both cables to the mainland of Australia. By the system, on each cable, received messages are taken on tape which is gummed on to forms and transcribed for delivery. The "sent" business was punched on a Gell or Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator and despatched through a transmitter to the distant station, where Morse signals appear on the tape. The Murray multiplex system then came into vogue, but was still in the experimental stage in Tasmania. Bowden served as a messenger for nine months, and in 1870 was appointed as operator. In 1887 he became chief operator, in succession to Mr. Macdonald, and in 1891 received the appointment of manager of the telegraph office at Hobart. Some four years later he found himself installed as chief clerk and operator, telegraph branch, under the scheme by which the postal and telegraph departments were amalgamated, and in 1899 was appointed manager of the telegraph branch, each successive step re-presenting promotion. In 1919 Bowden was temporarily transferred as Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Tasmania to conduct the Federal elections in that year, and after the elections he resumed his duties in the Postmaster-General's Department, the following year, as manager of the telegraph branch. It may be noted that telegraph and telephone duties were combined as from the inception of the telephone system in 1883 until May, 1922, when a separate telephone branch was created with Mr. P. N. Ferris as telephone manager. Bowden's duties at various times included jurisdiction over the telegraph traffic throughout the State, as distinct from the management of the telegraph office at Hobart. Bowden retired from the public service at age 65 on 18 August 1925, having served for some 50 years and three months. At retirement he noted that the former Deputy Postmaster at Hobart, Mr. H. L. D'Emden, who retired in August, 1923, William Philpot Hallam, who left the service in August, 1924, and himself were all three telegraph messengers, having entered the service together.
Personal life.
As a boy chorister in St. David's Cathedral he first sang the solo, "I was glad when they said unto me we will go into the house of the Lord" and extent for the few years he spent as a member of the choir there. He had been a parishioner of Holy Trinity Church. He sang in the choir at Holy Trinity when about 10 years of age, during the rectorate of the Ven. Arch-deacon Davenport, and it was when St. David's Cathedral was opened that with other boy choristers from various parish churches he assisted with his voice in the opening ceremony, and with other boys remained there for a time. In 1900 Bowden returned to Trinity Church, was appointed choirmaster some three years later, and has held the position till 1925. His name is musically remembered as having been associated with the Mohawk Club and the Orpheus Club. For more than 20 years he was secretary to the Philharmonic Society and other musical organisations, and his tenor voice was on many occasions heard as a soloist in "The Messiah" and other works. He was also associated with the introduction of the popular "Waltzing Matilda" in connection with local community singing. He supplemented his many activities in church life by serving on a number of Diocesan church committees, was a member of the Synod and Diocesan Council, and vice-chairman of the Church of England Men's Society. An enthusiastic Mason, Mr. Bowden joined the Pacific Lodge at Hobart 35 years ago, and has passed through various Grand Lodge offices. In 1925 he held the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master and president of the Board of General Purposes. The Pacific Lodge made him an honorary life member, and when the rank of Past Deputy Grand Master was conferred on him the mother lodge presented him with a handsome set of regalia. Bowden was a particularly keen bowler and also a fisherman. For 40 years he spend his annual holidays on the East Coast for bream fishing at Swansea and Swanport, and has been a member of the Derwent Bowling Club since its inception.

Aubrey Franklin Hess

Aubrey Franklin Hess (December 8, 1874 – October 27, 1935) was a progressive American theologian and educator. Born on a mountaintop farm in Virginia, Hess without formal theological training was ordained in the Methodist Protestant church in 1896 and immediately served two small congregations in West Virginia. Later, after completing his formal theological and university education, Hess served as president of the Methodist Protestant institutions of West Lafayette College, Ohio and Adrian College, Michigan.
After leaving Adrian College in 1917 Hess returned to church pastoral duties ministering to Methodist Protestant, Congregational and Unitarian-Universalist churches.
Hess made nationwide news in 1927 when he changed the traditional wedding vow of “until death us do part” to “as long as this union shall last.” Hess believed in the separation of state and church. Although his church granted divine sanction for a civil ceremony, state law retained provisions for marriage annulment regardless of the words used in the wedding ceremony. Hess also dropped the use of the word “obey” from the wedding service. Rather, he solicited a promise given freely to provide, protect and keep pure and unspotted. Hess concluded his reasoning saying, “I would not under any circumstances perform a ceremony where these conditions were not agreed to. I never ask if they will ‘obey.’ What's the use?”
Early life and education.
Hess was born December 8, 1874 in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. He was the only child of John A. Hess and Mary E. Hess (nee Thomas). When Hess was five years old, his mother died. His father later remarried, giving Hess an immediate family of seven half brothers and sisters.
In a 1926 newspaper interview, Hess recalled that his father, a hardscrabble mountain farmer, was not an educated man. Growing up Hess attended only local public schools and had few experiences outside that of a farm boy.
Randolp-Macaon Academy and correspondence course.
Hess expanded his early mountain education with a two-year course of study at Randolph-Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia. Hess graduated from this preparatory school in 1895. Afterward, Hess returned to West Virginia where he completed a four-year (1896–1900) correspondence course (also known as a conference course) “under state-authorized facility and examiners."
Westminster Theological Seminary.
In 1900 or 1901 Hess started formal theological studies at Westminster Theological Seminary in Westminster, Maryland. Hess also simultaneously took additional courses at Western Maryland College that shared a common campus with the seminary. Upon graduation from theology school in 1903, Hess was 29 years old, married and had two children.
University of West Virginia.
Hess continued his studies (1903–1908) at the University of West Virginia (UWV). Hess enrolled as a “special” student, as were many others. In 1906 he was awarded a “special” A.B. (Artium Baccalaureus – Bachelor of Arts) degree and in 1907 he was awarded a “special” A &amp; S degree (it is not known what this degree is).
Newspaper accounts also indicate that Hess was a teacher at the university and a part-time minister for the Methodist Protestant Church in Morgantown, West Virginia. In August 1908, Hess resigned his part-time pastorate and his West Virginia University teaching position to accept a one-year teaching assignment at Kansas City University, Missouri.
Denominational and educational career.
Early pastorates.
Hess's ministerial career pre-dates his formal theological education. He was ordained in the Methodist Protestant denomination around 1896 in Harrisville, West Virginia. He later held pastorates in two West Virginia churches; Nestorville (1896–1897) and St. Mary's (1898–1900).
Following his pastorate in St. Mary's, Hess, as noted earlier, devoted time from 1900 to 1908 on academic studies. From 1903 to 1908 Hess was also a part-time pastor to the Methodist Protestant Church in Morgantown, West Virginia.
During his time in Morgantown, Hess became engaged in Methodist Protestant denominational affairs. At the 1908 Methodist Protestant quadrennial conference, Hess was successfully nominated to serve on the board of governors of his alma mater, the Westminster Theological Seminary. Hess, however, was unsuccessful in his bid to be secretary of the board for the Young People's Work organization, the denomination's effort to harness youth engagement. Hess also served on the conference's standing education committee. At the next quadrennial conference in 1912, Hess again was successfully nominated to the board of governors of the Westminster Theological Seminary. He was also assigned to the Revisions Committee of the conference.
Methodist Protestant Church in Buckhannon, West Virginia.
Following his one-year assignment in Kansas City in 1909, Hess accepted the pastorate of the Methodist Protestant Church in Buckhannon, West Virginia. Hess extended his denominational activities to the local level allowing his name to be offered for the presidency for the West Virginia Methodist Protestant Conference. Hess led on early balloting, but when notified by telegram that his ill wife had taken a turn for the worse, he withdrew his name from consideration.
College president.
Two years later in 1911, Hess resigned his pastorate in West Virginia and moved to Ohio to accept the position of president of West Lafayette College.
West Lafayette College, incorporated in 1900, was the newest of the educational institutions maintained by the Methodist Protestant Church. In the public announcement of Hess's appointment as the college president, a Ph.D. academic credential was associated with Hess. No earlier public record had reported that Hess had achieved such a degree. It is assumed that the college conferred an honorary degree to the incoming president.
Among the actions taken by Hess as president at West Lafayette College was his proposal to consolidate his college with the Michigan-based Adrian College, another Methodist Protestant Church educational institution. The West Lafayette College trustees, however, voted to surrender control of the college to the General Conference of the Methodist Protestant Church for liquidation. At the 1916 Methodist Protestant quadrennial conference, the matter was resolved with the decision to consolidate the two colleges to Adrian, Michigan. Hess was appointed as Adrian's new president.
Hess remained at Adrian College until he resigned in 1917 to resume pastoral duties at the First Congregational Church of Manistee in Michigan.
First Congregational Church of Manistee.
There is little in the public record on Hess's pastorate in Manistee (1917–1921). The only contemporary comment on Hess's pastorate is offered in a history written of the Manistee church.
“The Reverend Dr. A. F. Hess was a man with a ‘brilliant mind and an eloquent tongue.’ He made patriotic addresses all over the country. He formed a group of around 100 men to discuss the war and other questions of the day. He gave a series of lectures on psychology.”
During his Manistee pastorate, Hess was also recognized by the American City bureau as one of America's 100 best speakers in the United States.
First Methodist Protestant Church.
Hess’s next pastorate was at the First Methodist Protestant Church (1921–1925) in Fort Worth, Texas. This pastorate was the result of a decision made by the Methodist Protestant Home Mission to send a minister to the Dallas – Fort Worth area to help build up the church in that area. Unfortunately, the public record of Hess's endeavors is silent. What is clear is that in 1925 he departed Fort Worth as well as left the Methodist Protestant denomination when he assumed the pastorate of the First Congregational Church in Beaumont, Texas.
First Congregational Church in Beaumont.
The pulpit in Beaumont became vacant following the resignation of the church’s founder Dr. Samuel Holden, who after two years accepted an appointment to the office of the assistant superintendent of the Congregational Church in the central south region. In founding the church Dr. Holden said, “In the record of our Lord’s life He gives us in clear language, so plain that He cannot be misunderstood or misinterpreted, at least four tests of a Christian disciple.” Those tests were loyalty to the truth, love of humanity, doing good and cross-bearing or, as Holden noted, the totality of life is summed up in what good we may do in life.
Hess's sermon topics in his inaugural year reflected both his desire to prepare his flock to be Christian disciples and his belief that religion includes the embrace of the human experience. Those topics include: “The Appeal and Response of Christ's Love as Revealed in Human Relationships,” “Shall We Cease to Think in Matters of Religion or Adopt a Policy of Blind Faith” and “The God of Human Experience.”
Hess extended his ministry beyond his Sunday pulpit to what was described in the local newspaper as a “Miniature University.” The Tuesday morning Woman's Lecture Club was devoted to a series of lectures by Hess on the philosophy of religion that explored world religions. Wednesday night classes offered lectures on general psychology. Friday night classes were designed for parents with lectures on child psychology. Three of these lectures also aired on the local KFDM radio station. A Boy's Science Club was also conducted with the purpose of explaining, as Hess said, “the what and why” of things to the church youth.
A large advertisement for the First Congregational Church in the Beaumont Enterprise newspaper reflected both Hess's and the church's character, “This is a distinctive church with a distinctive aim. It has no creed and values truth more highly than belief. It is emphatically opposed to ignorance, prejudice, religious bigotry, injustice and desecration of human values.”
Hess's pastorate in Beaumont ended in 1930 when he accepted a call to the United Liberal Church in Atlanta, Georgia.
United Liberal Church, Atlanta.
Hess's call to Atlanta was the result of outreach by Hess to Rev. George F. Patterson, executive vice president of the American Unitarian Association in Boston, Massachusetts. In a November 29, 1929 letter from Hess to Patterson, Hess followed up on a conversation the two gentlemen had had at the Southwestern Federation of Religious Liberals held in Lawrence, Kansas, early that year regarding Hess's desire to fellowship with the Unitarians.
Hess's new pastorate (1930–1935) at the United Liberal Church inserted him into a religious environment that was distinctively unique. The United Liberal Church was the result of a 1918 decision by local Atlanta Unitarians and Universalists to merge into a single congregation. This local merger pre-dates the national merger of the two denominations in 1961.
The 1918 merger was intended to be “a temporary merger to last for the duration of the war (World War I) and help win the war by saving fuel and light.” However, the merger continued until 1950 when internal and external conflicts over racial and political issues resulted in the collapse of this joint Unitarian Universalist congregation.
Hess assumed a pulpit in Atlanta that had been vacant for nine months following the resignation of Rev. Clinton Lee Scott. Scott had been a popular minister who had provided the joint congregation a sense of unity and achieved a sense of financial stability that had long eluded the congregation. Hess wrote to Rev. George F. Patterson one month after arriving in Atlanta stating that he had not yet acquired a “definite knowledge as to the real conditions of the Atlanta Church.”
Hess's sermons continued to have a familiar ring, “The Kingdom of God Is Within You,” “Christianity As It Was and Now Is” and “Jesus As He Must Have Been.”
Hess did not, however, reprise his miniature university concept in Atlanta. Atlanta home to several universities, libraries and arts venues was a more cosmopolitan environment than Beaumont. Additionally, the Atlanta church had long had an active men's and women's organizations that had been well-established venues for social and cultural exchange opportunities.
Since the founding of the church in 1884, Hess was only the third minister to serve five or more years in the pulpit. His ministry ending only by his unexpected death in October 1935.
Personal life.
In May 1897 Hess married Sabina Francina “Bina” Livesay in West Virginia. Into that marriage four children were born; Aubrey W. (1899–1929), Adrian T. (1900–1939), Robert LD (1903–1992) and Wanda L. (1908–1997).
The eldest child Aubrey W. served in France in World War I. After the war, Aubrey W. and his brother Adrian formed an aircraft manufacturing company in Michigan. In 1919 it was announced that the Rev. Aubrey F. Hess had been appointed the president of the aircraft company, Alliance Aircraft. This position was assumed to be honorific. Aubrey W. died in October 1929 when an aircraft he was testing caught fire and crashed.
Hess's marriage to Bina ended sometime in the mid-1920s. Hess subsequently remarried Jean Markley (née Van Horn). The only child of that marriage was Jean Cathlean who was born in 1928.
Rev. Hess died at 8 o’clock in the morning on October 27, 1935, of a heart attack in the lobby of the Waldo Hotel in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Hess had just attended the general convention of the Universalist church in Washington, D.C., and was en route to Cincinnati, Ohio to attend the general convention of the Unitarian church. Hess's death was widely reported in newspapers. The December 1935 issue of The Universalist Herald ran a cover story on Hess's death publishing his last sermon “What is a Man Without Honor” and the sermon of Rev. John Rowlett delivered at Hess's funeral service.
In his funeral sermon, Rev. Rowlett said, "A great and good man has gone. Our whole denomination and the cause of liberalism has lost something great." Rev. Rowlett continued, "He was a true liberal. He had a free mind. His mind was open to the four corners of the earth, ready, willing and eager to welcome truth from whatever direction it might come. He demanded an idea no passport of tradition but only the passport of truth.”
Legacy.
His widow Jean Hess remained an active member of the United Liberal Church until that congregation collapsed in 1950. Jean Hess continued her active membership in the rebirth of the new Unitarian Universalist congregation under the ministry of Rev. Edward Cahill. That new congregation gave rise to the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta (UUCA) in the early 1960s.
Due to growth and overcrowding in the late 1960s at UUCA, a new Unitarian congregation spun off from UUCA called Northwest Unitarian Church. The widow Jean Hess and her daughter joined that new church. Jean Wells (née Hess) was a Charter Member of that church.

New England Hebrew Farmers of the Emanuel Society Synagogue and Creamery Site

The New England Hebrew Farmers of the Emanuel Society Synagogue and Creamery Site is a complex of historic archaeological sites near the junction of Connecticut Routes 161 and 85 in Montville, Connecticut. The sites include that of a late 19th-century synagogue, and the remains of a creamery complex operated by local Jewish dairy farmers that was located nearby. It was one of the first rural Jewish settlements in the state, supported financially by the Baron de Hirsch. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
Description.
The New England Hebrew Farmers of the Emanuel Society Synagogue and Creamery Site is located southwest of the junction of Routes 161 and 85 in the village of Chesterfield. It consists of several parcels, and is partially bisected by Powers Brook, which originally provided power for the creamery. The site is wooded, except for an open grassy area where the synagogue stood. This area is now marked by a commemorative stone plaque. In the woods nearby are foundational remnants of the creamery building and other buildings related to the Jewish community that thrived here around the turn of the 20th century.
The Jewish community in Chesterfield was established in the 1890s as part of an effort by the Baron de Hirsch, a prominent Jewish philanthropist, to resettle Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe in the United States. Most of the original Jewish settlers in this area were Orthodox Jews who had first settled in Brooklyn, New York. Farmland in southeastern Connecticut was inexpensive at the time, and its purchase was supported financially by de Hirsch and others. A Jewish congregation was formally established in 1890, and was called Society Agudas Achim. A modest wood-frame synagogue was built on this site in 1892, and the creamery was built the same year as a cooperative venture of the congregants as an outlet for the milk they produced. Later buildings include a small powerhouse and a mikvah. The creamery only operated for about twenty years, before changing trends in dairy consumption led to its demise. The building was eventually repurposed as an inn, but was destroyed by fire in 1950. The synagogue was also damaged in the fire, and was also eventually abandoned. It was destroyed by an arsonist in 1975.
Descendendants of some of the original settlers formed a historical society in the 1980s to preserve and remember the legacy of the settlement, resulting in the placement of the commemorative marker, and the site's listings both as a state archaeological site and on the National Register of Historic Places.

Best Secret GmbH

The Best Secret GmbH, a subsidiary of Schustermann &amp; Borenstein GmbH, is an e-commerce company for designer merchandise based in Dornach (near Munich), Germany. Best Secret functions as a closed shopping community.
History.
The beginning of Schustermann &amp; Borenstein date back to 1924. The traditional family-run business is run by the third generation. Best Secret was founded as a subsidiary of Schustermann &amp; Borenstein in 2007 to create an online presence.
Business Model.
Best Secret’s works as a closed shopping community. This means that the offers are only available to registered members and these members have access to a selection of permanently reduced designer merchandise. In order to maintain this pricing policy and yet protect the exclusivity of the brands, access to the online store is limited to 250,000 members. A prospective user must be recommended by an existing member to gain access. However, the COO, Marian Schikora, will review any new recommendation to ensure that the total number of members is kept low (for example, only a limited number of people per region can become members).
Internationalization.
The company is active in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Latvia, Netherlands, Slovenia, Italy, Ireland, Belgium and Romania. In addition, Best Secret GmbH acquired the Swiss online fashion retailer FashionFriends on April 1, 2016.
Investors.
In 2012, Schustermann &amp; Borenstein sold two-thirds of its shares to Axa Private Equity Group (now Ardian), which included shares in Best Secret GmbH. The remaining shares remained family-owned by Daniel Schustermann, Emil Schustermann, Benno Borenstein and Daniel Borenstein, who continue to run the operating business.
In 2016, Ardian sold the Schustermann &amp; Borenstein and BestSecret company shares to Permira. The enterprise value lay approximately between 700 and 750 million euro.
In 2020, Moritz Hahn (Zalando top Manager) joined Best Secret as a Co-CEO of the company. 
Logistics Locations.
Best Secret warehouse moved to a new central warehouse in Poing near Munich in 2015. The size of the facility is 28,800 square meters and has a capacity of up to 4 million pieces of clothing.
Development Locations.
Best Secret development center are located in Granada and Munich.
Cargo Container Hardwood Beetle Incident.
In 2016, there was one incident in which nine employees were injured and another 51 had to seek medical treatment. The cause was based on two containers from China, which were provided with means that should avoid the import of Asian longhorn beetle. Employees complained of airborne contaminants that caused irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The product in question has been returned. The warehouse was put back into service the following day. Daniel Schustermann promised to introduce stricter security measures in the future to protect employees.

Ancient protein

Ancient proteins are the ancestors of modern proteins that survive as molecular fossils. Certain structural features of functional importance, particularly relating to metabolism and reproduction, are often conserved through geologic time. Early proteins consisted of simple amino acids, with more complicated amino acids being formed at a later stage through biosynthesis. Such late-arising amino acids included molecules like: histidine, phenylalanine, cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Ancient enzymatic proteins performed basic metabolic functions and required the presence of specific co-factors. The characteristics and ages of these proteins can be traced through comparisons of multiple genomes, the distribution of specific architectures, amino acid sequences, and the signatures of specific products caused by particular enzymatic activities. Alpha and beta proteins (α/β) are considered the oldest class of proteins.
Mass spectrometry is one analytical method used to determine the mass and chemical makeup of peptides. Ancestral sequence reconstruction takes place through the collection and alignment of homologous amino acid sequences. These sequences must bear a sufficient amount of diversity to contain phylogenetic signals that resolve evolutionary relationships and allow for further deduction of targeted ancient phenotype. From there a phylogenetic tree can be constructed to illustrate the genetic resemblance between various amino acid sequences and common ancestors. The ancestral sequence is then inferred and reconstructed through maximum likelihood at the phylogenetic node(s). From there, encoding genes are synthesized, expressed, purified, and incorporated into the genome of an extant host organisms. Functionality and product properties are observed and experimentally characterized. Using a greater degree of variance in representative monomeric proteins will increase the overall precision of the results.
History.
In 1955, Philip Abelson published a short paper that laid out what has become, through several cycles of technical advances, the field of palaeoproteomics or ancient protein research. He was the first to propose that amino acids, and therefore proteins, were present in a fossil bone millions of years old which gave clues about the evolution of very early life forms on our planet. Only a few years later, Hare and Abelson (1968) conducted another pioneering analysis on shells and found out that amino acids degrade or change their internal L to D configuration progressively over time, and that this could thus be used as dating tool, in what is called amino acid dating or amino acid racemization. This dating approach was later shown to be a very capable tool for dating periods extending further back than the limits of radiocarbon at ca. 50,000 years.
Structure and evolution.
Ecological and geological events that changed the conditions of Earth's global environment effected the evolution of protein structure. The Great Oxidation Event, triggered by the development of phototrophic organisms like cyanobacteria, resulted in a world-wide increase in oxygen. This pressured various groups of anaerobic prokaryotes, changing the microbial diversity and global metabolome, as well as altering enzyme substrates and kinetics.
Certain areas of proteins are more prone to undergo evolutionary change at a rapid rate, while others are unusually tolerant. Essential genes - or sequences of genetic material responsible for protein architecture, structure, catalytic metal co-factor binding centers, or interaction - will experience little change compared to the rest of the genetic material. Portions of this material will be confronted with genetic mutations that affect amino acid sequencing. These mutations laid the ground for other mutations and interactions that had major consequences towards protein structure and function, resulting in proteins with similar sequences serving entirely different purposes.
Joseph Thornton, an evolutionary biologist, researched steroid hormones and their binding receptors to map their evolutionary relationship. He inserted DNA molecules, equipped with reconstructed amino acid sequences from ancient proteins, into in-vitro cells to make them synthesize ancestral proteins. The team discovered that reconstructed ancestral protein were capable of reconfiguration in response to multiple hormones. Additional studies conducted by other research teams indicate the evolutionary development of greater protein specificity over time. Ancestral organisms required proteins - mainly enzymes - capable of catalyzing a broad range of biochemical reactions to survive with a limited proteostome. Subfunctionalization and gene duplication in multifunctional and promiscuous proteins led to the development of simpler molecules with the ability to perform more specific tasks. Not all studies concur however. Some results suggest evolutionary trends through less-specific intermediates or molecules bearing two high-specificity states or decreased specificity altogether.
A second apparent evolutionary trend is the global transition away from thermostability for mesophilic protein lineages. The temperature at which various ancient proteins melt was correlated with the optimum growth temperature of extinct or extant organisms. The higher temperatures of the Precambrian affected optimum growth temperatures. Higher thermostability in proteinaceous structures facilitated their survival under more critical conditions. Heterogeneous environments, neutral drift, random adaptations, mutations, and evolution are some of the factors that influenced this non-linear transition and caused fluctuation in thermostability. This led to the development of alternative mechanisms of surviving fluctuating environmental conditions.
Certain ancestral proteins followed alternative evolutionary routes to obtain the same functional outcomes. Organisms that evolved along different pathways developed proteins that performed similar functions. In some cases, changing a single amino acid was enough to provide an entirely new function. Other ancestral sequences became over-stabilized and were incapable of conformational changes in response to shifting environmental stimuli.
Associated fields.
Palaeoproteomics.
Palaeoproteomics is a neologism used to describe the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches to the study of ancient proteomes. As with palaeogenomics (the study of ancient DNA, aDNA), it intersects evolutionary biology, archaeology and anthropology, with applications ranging from the phylogenetic reconstruction of extinct species to the investigation of past human diets and ancient diseases.
The field was pioneered when Peggy Ostrom used MALDI-TOF with post source decy to sequence osteocalcin in 50,000 year old bison bone. With the advent of soft-ionization and use of coupled liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem MS systems (ie. MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS), the high-throughput of information about ancient proteins has grown significantly. One reason for this, is that proteins have been shown to be robust molecule in archaeological and other Quaternary samples. In situations where ancient DNA has long since degraded to sub-useful fragments, protein sequencing has helped to answer phylogenetic questions such as the placing of "Toxodon" sp. Analysis of more complex protein mixtures, are just emerging. Analysis of binding adhesives usually thought to derive from birch resin ("Betula" L.), have shown to actually be animal glue.
Other fields.
Zooarcheology uses mass spectrometry and protein analyses to determine the evolutionary relationship between different animal species due to differences in proteinaceous mass, for instance collagen. Techniques such as shotgun proteomics allows researchers to identify proteomes and the exact sequences of amino acids within different kinds of proteins. These sequences can be compared to other organisms within different clades to determine their evolutionary relationships within the phylogenetic tree. Proteins are also more preserved in fossils than DNA, allowing researchers to recover proteins from the enamel of 1.8 million year old animal teeth and mineral crystals of 3.8 million year old eggshells.
Applications and products.
Combined genome and protein sequencing research has allowed for scientists to further piece together narratives of archaic environmental conditions and past evolutionary relationships. Research into the thermostability of protein structures permits predictions of past global temperatures. Ancestral sequence reconstruction further reveals the origins of human ethanol metabolism and the evolution of various species. An example of this would be the identification and differentiation of Denisovan hominids from modern "Homo sapien sapiens" through amino acid variants in collagen obtained from the former's teeth.
The study of ancient proteins has not only helped to determine the evolutionary history of viral proteins but facilitated the development of new drugs.
Benefits and limitations.
Understanding protein function and evolution provides new methods of engineering and controlling evolutionary pathways to produce useful templates and byproducts - more specifically, proteins with high thermostability and broad substrate specificity.
Multiple limitations as well as possible sources of error must be taken under consideration, and possible solutions or alternatives put into place. The statistical construction of ancient proteins is unverifiable and will not have identical amino acid sequences to ancestral proteins. Reconstruction can also be affected by multiple factors including: mutations; turnover rates - as prokaryotic species are more prone to genetic change than their eukaryotic counterparts, making it harder to determine their proteomic past; amino acid distribution; and limited resources of fully sequenced genomes and amino acid sequences of extant species. Ancestral protein reconstruction also assumes that certain homologous phenotypes actually existed within ancient proteinaceous populations when in fact the data recovered is but an estimate consensus of the total pre-existing diversity. Inadequate taxonomic sampling can lead to inaccurate phylogenetic trees due to long branch attraction. Proteins can also get degraded over time into small fragments and have modern proteins incorporated into them - making identification difficult or inaccurate. Last but not least, fossilized remnants contain minuscule amounts of proteins that can be used for further study and identification and actually provide less information regarding evolutionary patterns compared to genome sequences.
Additional concerns regarding ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method would lie in the underlying bias in thermostability due to the usage of maximum-likelihood in obtaining data. This makes ancient proteins appear more stable than they actually were. Using alternative reconstruction methods - for instance the Bayesian method that incorporates and averages over the level of uncertainty - could provide a comparable reference regarding ancestral stability. However, this method performs poor reconstructions and may not accurately reflect actual conditions.

Listed buildings in Broseley

Broseley is a civil parish in Shropshire, England. It contains 37 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England. Of these, four are listed at Grade II*, the middle of the three grades, and the others are at Grade II, the lowest grade. The parish contains the town of Broseley, the village of Jackfield, and the surrounding countryside. It was in the 18th and early 19th centuries a centre for coal mining, then ironworking, but there are no significant survivors from this. In the later 19th century a tile making factory was established at Jackfield, and much of it survives as the Jackfield Tile Museum, many of its buildings being listed. In the town there is a former clay pipe factory which is listed. Otherwise, most of the listed buildings are houses, and the others include a farmhouse, a former hotel, public houses, a former butcher's shop, a former toll house, a church, and a war memorial.

Aldania themis

Aldania themis is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic (Ussuri, China, Korea) that belongs to
the browns family.
Description from Seitz.
N. themis Leech (54f) differs from the preceding species in the median band on the hindwing beneath being anteriorly
abbreviated and in the 2—3 violet spots standing in the prolongation of the band being absent; on the other hand, there
is on the forewing below a large light spot near the distal margin between the radials.*) The distribution-area of this form according to Oberthur extends from West China (Siaolou) to Sikkim, where it is replaced by the nomenclatorially 
typical form, "N. nycteus" Nicev., which has white instead of yellow spots. *Contrary to customary treatment 
"N. themis" and "thisbe" are here dealt with as different species. In this I follow Ch. Oberthur's opinion ("Etudes de Lepidopterol." Comparee II), although the differences do not appear to be quite sufficient for specific separation. There can hardly be any doubt that the classification of the species of "Neptis", especially of the "thetis" group, will be modified in many respects as our knowledge of the geographical distribution and seasonal variation increases. At present one has to be content with a grouping which is the more probably correct classification according to one's personal opinion. As not weighty enough I must regard the characters of a number of species described by Oberthur in the place cited ; particularly the separation of "thisbe" from "themis" and the specific value attributed to some forms of the "thestias" series does not seem to be tenable. — Stichel.

<doc id="56920346" url="?curid=56920346" title="Zindler curve">
Zindler curve

A Zindler curve is a simple closed plane curve with the defining property
The most simple examples of a Zindler curve are the circles. The Austrian mathematician Konrad Zindler discovered further examples and gave a method to construct them. Herman Auerbach was the first, who used (in 1938) the now established name "Zindler curve". 
Auerbach proved that a figure bounded by a Zindler curve and with half the density of water will float in water in any position. This gives a negative answer to the bidimensional version of Stanislaw Ulam's problem on floating bodies (Problem 19 of the Scottish Book), which asks if the disk is the only figure of uniform density which will float in water in any position (the original problem asks if the sphere is the only solid having this property in three dimension). 
Zindler curves are also connected to the problem of establishing if its possible to determine the direction of the motion of a bicycle given only the closed rear and front tracks. 
Equivalent definitions.
An equivalent definition of a Zindler curve is the following one:
These chords are the same, which cut the curve length into halves.
Another definition is based on Zindler carousels of two chairs. Consider two smooth curves in R² given by λ1 and λ2. Suppose that the distance between points λ1(t) and λ2(t) are constant for each "t" ∈ R and that the curve defined by the midpoints between λ1 and λ2 is such that its tangent vector at the point "t" is parallel to the segment from λ1("t") to λ2("t") for each "t". If the curves λ1 and λ2 parametrizes the same smooth closed curve, then this curve is a Zindler curve.
Examples.
Consider a fixed real parameter formula_1. For formula_2, any of the curves
is a Zindler curve. For formula_4 the curve is even "convex". The diagram shows curves for formula_5 (blue), formula_6 (green) and formula_7 (red). For formula_8 the curves are related to a curve of constant width.
"Proof of (L):" The derivative of the parametric equation is
formula_11 is formula_12-periodic.
Hence for any formula_13 the following equation holds
which is half the length of the entire curve.
The desired chords, which divide the curve into halves are bounded by the points formula_15 for any formula_16. The length of such a chord is formula_17 hence independent of formula_13. ∎ 
For formula_19 the desired chords meet the curve in an additional point (see Figure 3). Hence only for formula_20 the sample curves are Zindler curves. 
Generalizations.
The property defining Zindler curves can also be generalized to chords that cut the perimeter of the curve in a fixed ratio α different from 1/2. In this case, one may consider a chord system (a continuous selection of chords) instead of all chords of the curve. These curves are known as α-Zindler curves, and are Zindler curves for α = 1/2. This generalization of Zindler curve has the following property related to the floating problem: let γ be a closed smooth curve with a chord system cutting the perimeter in a fixed ratio α. If all the chords of this chord system are in the interior of the region bounded by γ, then γ is a α-Zindler curve if and only if the region bounded by γ is a solid of uniform density ρ that floats in any orientation.

Voyeur (Berlin album)

Voyeur is the fifth studio album from the American new wave band Berlin, released in 2002 by iMUSIC. It was the band's first studio album since 1986's "Count Three &amp; Pray", with singer Terri Nunn as the only original member of the new line-up.
Background.
Following the release of "Count Three &amp; Pray", the original Berlin split in 1987, but was revived by Nunn with a new line-up in 1998. With the arrival of new member Mitchell Sigman in 2000, Berlin began recording "Voyeur" in 2001. Originally, Nunn had planned to independently release an EP of new material, however the band then signed with iMUSIC who requested a full album. Speaking of the album's sound to "Billboard", iMUSIC vice chairman commented: "It does not sound like an early-80s band trying to make a comeback. We heard the music and [believed] it was relevant and contemporary."
"Voyeur" was released in August 2002. To promote the album, iMUSIC focused on using the internet to "re-establish links with longtime fans while cultivating a new audience". Berlin embarked on a press and radio tour in September, followed by a series of live concert dates. In 2003, "With a Touch" was released as a promotional single in the US. In mid-2003, "Voyeur" reached No. 33 on the CMJ New Music Report's RPM Chart, based on the airplay it had gained.
Critical reception.
Upon release, "Billboard" described the album as a "continuation of its 1980s synth-hewn, new-wave beginnings" and a "welcome return", adding: "The group picks up its dance roots and signature vocals throughout "Voyeur", particularly on such tracks as "Blink of an Eye" and "Drug"." Will Harris of "PopMatters" commented "Voyeur" "could well be the best work they've ever produced". He added: "The dance influences remain on "Voyeur"; in fact, the first two tracks, "Blink of an Eye" and "Shiny", are both potential floor-fillers." "Curve" described the album as "a mutation of Nunn's "No More Words" — steady pop vocals, a deeper edge to catch up with the times, and a multitude of layers: plugged-in guitar, dance-mix sequences and thick harmonies."

The 2018 Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council election took place on 3 May 2018 to elect members of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council in England. This was on the same day as other local elections. Stockport Council is elected in thirds, which means that in each three member local ward, one councillor is elected every year, except every four years which is classed as a fallow year. The last fallow year was 2017, when no local government elections took place in the borough. Those councillors elected in 2018 will serve a four-year term, expiring in 2022. The election in Edgeley &amp; Cheadle Heath was deferred, owing to the death of the Conservative candidate, until 24 May 2018.
After the election, the Labour minority administration that had governed since 2016 was able to continue in office, although without a majority the administrations budget was voted down in March 2019, the first time this had happened since the 1980s.

Australia has over 130 skyscrapers —buildings which reach or exceed heights of )— complete and or under construction, all spread throughout five cities of the country. Most skyscrapers are located in cities within the Eastern states of Australia, and a number of these cities, such as Melbourne and Sydney, also rank high in the world list of cities with the most skyscrapers.
Cities by number of skyscrapers.
Five cities in Australia currently host at least one skyscraper – all of which are state capitals, with the exception of the Gold Coast, a city in the state of Queensland. Of Australian cities which comprise skyscrapers, Sydney constructed the first skyscraper in the country in 1967, followed by Melbourne in 1972, Brisbane and Perth in 1988, and most recently, the Gold Coast in 2005. Most skyscrapers in Australia are concentrated in the Eastern states (Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria), whilst a smaller number are located in the Western Australia state capital, Perth. The cities with the highest number of skyscrapers have traditionally been either Sydney or Melbourne since the 1970s. The only other capital cities in Australia to not feature any skyscrapers whatsoever are Adelaide in South Australia, Hobart in Tasmania, Darwin in the Northern Territory, and Australia's capital, Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory.

Shepherd's dial

A shepherd's dial (also known as a pillar dial or cylinder) is a type of sundial that measures the height of the sun via the so-called "umbra versa". Its design needs to incorporate a fixed latitude, but it is small and portable. It is named after Pyrenean shepherds, who would trace such a sundial on their staffs. This type of sundial was very popular in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.
History.
Since the ancient Roman era, people have created sundials which tell the time by measuring differences in the sun's height above the horizon over the course of the day – Vitruvius describes them as "viatoria pensilia". The earliest description of a shepherd's dial as known today was written by Hermann of Reichenau, an 11th-century Benedictine monk who called it a "cylindrus horarius". It was also known in the Middle Ages as a "chilinder oxoniensis" (Oxford cylinder). Such sundials did not need aligning north-south and so became very popular, appearing in Renaissance artworks such as Holbein's 1528 "Portrait of Nicolaus Kratzer" and his 1533 "The Ambassadors".
Variants.
A Slovenian shepherd's dial is a flat dial in the shape of a sector of a circle. It is hung vertically and measures the altitude of the sun. A movable peg adjusts for the changing seasons.

Louis Bernier

Stanislas-Louis Bernier (21 February 1845 – 2 February 1919) was a French architect.
Biography.
Born in Paris, Bernier entered the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1864 as a student of Honoré Daumet. Twice a finalist in the competition for the Prix de Rome, he won the first grand prize in 1872 for a natural history museum project. He stayed at the Académie de France in Rome from 1873 to 1877. The principal design he sent from Rome consisted of an ambitious restoration of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (1877).
Back in Paris in 1878, he joined the government bureaucracy as an architect for the Conseil Général des Bâtiments Civils. He succeeded as the architect of the École des Beaux-Arts in 1890. In addition to maintaining the buildings erected by Félix Duban between 1832 and 1864, he also built there a monument to Duban which paraphrased Duban's architectural style.
Bernier's major work is the Opéra-Comique theatre, the Salle Favart, which needed to be rebuilt following an 1887 fire. He obtained the commission by winning a competition judged by five winners of the Grand Prix de Rome (including Charles Garnier), which ensured the design would reflect academic and official tastes. Because of disputes within the profession, more avant-garde architects did not participate. Built from 1893 to 1898, the theatre is typical Beaux-Arts architecture. The facade is an adaptation of Garnier's design for the Opéra, and the elaborate exterior and interior decoration shows the influence of both Garnier and Daumet.
In 1898, Bernier was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts (in seat number 3 of the architecture section). He led an official workshop of the École des Beaux-Arts from 1905 to 1919 and was president of the Société Centrale des Architectes Français from 1911 to 1914.
Bernier died in Paris and is buried at Père-Lachaise Cemetery (68th division). A bibliophile, he bequeathed his collection of ancient works to the Musée Condé located at Chantilly, Oise.
His name was given to a square in Paris in the Batignolles district.

Tang Chang

Tang Chang (; ;; 1 May 1934 – 26 August 1990) was a self-taught artist, poet, writer and philosopher of Sino-Thai heritage. He was one of well-known Thai poet and artist.
Biography.
He was born on 1 May 1934 to a poor, Chinese family in the area of the Somdet Chao Phraya Market, Thonburi, across the river from Bangkok. As a young boy, he studied at the Pitchaya Yatikaram Temple School, until the effects of World War II on his family’s financial situation forced him to end his education.
After Chang left school, he developed an interest in artistic expression and used found pieces of charcoal and chalk to draw on the streets and the walls of his home. With funds received from his work as a menial labourer, he bought paper, paint and pencils and with these began drawing portraits of his family members and neighbours. He continued this practice until he was able to open a stall at a local market to undertake portraits professionally. After that, Chang began painting watercolour landscapes of the areas around his house. In 1960, one of these paintings, a landscape featuring the house of Pratuang Emjaoren, a well-known Thai artist and a close friend of Chang’s, became the first of his works to be included in an exhibition.
In the late 1950s, Chang began producing the first of his gestural abstraction paintings for which he is best known. According to the artist, these paintings were the result of a series of experimentations undertaken with the aim of developing a style that reflected Buddhist and Daoist principles, while also offering an alternative to the cubistic and impressionistic works that dominated Thai art circles of the period. These works were exhibited for the first time in 1966 at the Pratumwan art gallery, but were not received favourably by Thai audiences.
In 1968, when the artist was 34 years old, he self-published a book featuring his ‘concrete poems,’ which dealt with social themes as well as more personal meditations on nature and family life. Unlike his paintings, these works garnered interest from Thai literary circles, gaining popularity within counterculture movements that were gaining traction in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Throughout his career, Chang positioned himself outside of mainstream art circles dominated by Silpakorn University and its National Exhibition of Art. Instead, he preferred to hold exhibitions of his and his student’s works at his own home. Similarly, Chang generally refused to sell his works, preferring instead to gain income through other means. Chang died in August 1990 at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife, four sons and three daughters.

<doc id="56920761" url="?curid=56920761" title="Flemish Expressionism">
Flemish Expressionism

Flemish Expressionism, also referred to as Belgian Expressionism, was one of the dominant art styles in Flanders during the interbellum. Influenced by artists like James Ensor and the early works of Vincent van Gogh, it was a distinct contemporary of German Expressionism. Contrary to the more rebellious and erotic nature of many German Expressionist works, the Flemish art of the School of Latem was more oriented towards the farming life, and was expressed in earthy colours and vigorous brushwork. It was also in general more oriented towards France and Brussels than to Germany, and incorporated elements of Fauvism and Cubism, for example the interest in "primitive" art, of both the ethnic and folk traditions. Flemish Expressionists like Spilliaert were more influenced by Ensor and Symbolism, or like Wouters were closer to the vibrant colours used by the Fauvists. The main proponents were Gust De Smet, Constant Permeke and Frits Van den Berghe.
Development.
The movement originated with Albert Servaes, member of the first artist colony at Sint-Martens-Latem, who gradually moved from Symbolism to a new style from 1905 on. From 1911 on, his influence became visible in the work of Constant Permeke, who is usually considered the foremost master of the movement. It was centred around an art colony in Sint-Martens-Latem, an idyllic village on the banks of the river Lys in East Flanders, near Ghent. Permeke had studied art in Ghent, together with Gustave de Smet and Frits Van den Berghe.
Before the First World War, emerging Belgian Expressionists such as Frits Van den Berghe, Gustave De Smet and Constant Permeke were inspired by Fauvism and to some extent by Cubism, emulating the bright Impressionist approach of Émile Claus and Théo van Rysselberghe. Rik Wouters in particular was attracted by the Fauvists but he died in 1916 after suffering from a serious illness.
During World War I, most painters from Sint-Martens-Latem fled Belgium: Gustaaf Van de Woestijne, Léon de Smet and others lived in London, where they continued working in a late Impressionistic style. Permeke also lived in England but already painted in a monumental, dark expressionism. Gustave De Smet and Frits Van den Berghe lived in the Netherlands, where in about 1916 they changed their style from a melancholy Impressionism to the new Expressionism, influenced by Dutch painters like Jan Sluyters, the German Heinrich Campendonk, and the French cubist Henri Le Fauconnier who also lived in the Netherlands during the war. This version of Flemish Expressionism, influenced by constructivism, futurism and cubism, continued after the war in the short-lived art colony in Blaricum, where van den Berghe and De Smet joined Jozef Cantré.
After the war, most artists went to live in and around Sint-Martens-Latem, establishing what has been called the second school of Latem.
In the 1920s, while Permeke, De Smet and Van den Berghe painted in Ghent, at the European level it was Brussels which became closely associated with the evolving Flemish Expressionist scene. By 1930, Van den Berghe had been attracted by Surrealism while Realism had influenced the work of De Smet. On the other hand, Edgard Tytgat developed his Expressionist style rather later than the others. Concentrating on story telling, he presented a somewhat satirical view of mankind, especially in his paintings of men and women.
Flemish Expressionism has been called "Belgium's most important contribution to modern art".

Rail of the Star

, is an anime film based on Chitose Kobayashi's autobiographical novel of the same name, produced on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Japanese Movie Center.
It narrates the vicissitudes suffered by the Kobayashi family after the armed conflict of the World War II, focused according to Chitose's vision at the time.
It was produced by TV Tokyo, animated by Madhouse and directed by Toshio Hirata; its premiere in Japan was on July 10, 1993.
Plot.
Chitose Kobayashi, a seven-year-old Japanese girl, raised in the Sinuiju of Korea occupied by Japan during World War II, completely ignored what it meant to be at war, but unfortunately she soon discovered that it affected the soldiers so much that they fight on the mountain front like the civilians living far away from the battlefield.
World War II begins for her the day her father receives a letter that forced him to enlist in the army and leave for the front.
Subsequently, a series of devastating events that mark her childhood occur. Miko, Chitose's younger sister, dies of typhoid; Ohana, her Korean servant girl and friend, is fired after committing imprudence; and Japan surrenders to the Allies.
Upon returning from her father, already in times of peace, the Russians invaded North Korea and the whole family was forced to leave that country. After unearthing the ashes of Miko, they must board a train that will take them further south of the 38th parallel, where the Americans are. However, they are forced to abandon it halfway to escape an inspection of the North Koreans. Another of the setbacks with which they have to face is the disorientation to walk on unknown roads, which causes them to move in circles throughout the day, but manage to follow the map drawn by the stars in the sky. As they progress, the difficulties will increase until they reach an emotional outcome.

Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists

Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists or Ad Hoc Women Artists' Committee was founded in 1970 and included members from Women Artists in Revolution (WAR), the Art Workers' Coalition (AWC) and Women Students and Artists for Black Art Liberation (WSABAL). Founding members included Lucy Lippard, Poppy Johnson, Brenda Miller, Faith Ringgold and later, Nancy Spero.
The group's specific focus was to address the under-representation of women in the Whitney Museum's Painting and Sculpture Annual, the precursor to what is now known as the Whitney Biennial. During the months leading up to the exhibition in December of 1970, the Ad Hoc Committee of Women Artists staged numerous protests and interventions at the museum circulating their demand that 50% of artists represented in the upcoming exhibition be women. Coinciding with the opening of the 1970 Sculpture Annual, they printed fake tickets and distributed a forged press release stating that "half the artists in the exhibition would indeed be women, with a proportional percentage of black, Asian, and Puerto Rican artists," forcing the director of the museum to issue a statement to the contrary. The group's actions had quantifiable results--the number of women represented rose from 4.5 to 22 percent in one year.
In the winter of 1970-71 the group established the Women's Art Registry, a slide collection of work by female artists, which served as a model for later registries like West-East Bag (W.E.B.). The registry was housed by several galleries, including cooperatives 55 Mercer and A.I.R., before going to Special Collections and University Archives at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where it is now archived. 
In 1972, the Committee (on the colophon listed as: Maude Boltz, Loretta Dunkelman, Joan Snyder, Nancy Spero, May Stevens and Joyce Kozloff) published the Rip-Off File. The 'dossier' was based on responses they received when Spero and Kozloff sent letters to 800 women in the art world asking for stories about their experiences with sexism and discrimination. "The Rip-Off File" was installed as an exhibition at the Mabel Smith Douglass Library during the 1973-74 academic year.

Rullia gens

The gens Rullia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Rullius" is derived from the cognomen "Rullus", a beggar. The surname is better known in its derivative form, "Rullianus", from Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, one of the greatest statesmen and generals of the Roman Republic, who as a young man defied the orders of the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor by engaging the enemy while his commander was away, winning a famous victory, but was then obliged to beg the Roman people to spare his life, when Cursor declared it forfeit. Chase classifies "Rullius" among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Rulii were "Gaius" and "Gnaeus", although there are also instances of "Servius" and "Sextus". "Servius" was an uncommon name, although not especially rare; it tended to run in families. All of the others were quite common throughout Roman history.

Gallner

The Gallner (Gallner Berg:710 m) is a mountain ridge near Konzell in the Bavarian Forest that runs from west to east between the valley of the Kinsach in the west and the Menach valley. The E8 European long distance path runs over it.
Name.
The mountain is called the Gallner because it was used as a mountain pasture for heifers (German: "Galtvieh"). An old form of the name of the ridge in the early 18th century was "Goldner".
Description.
The mountain is unusual in having three almost equally high summits or "kuppen": the "Gallner Berg" (710 m)(), "Kühleite" (704 m)() and "Blumerberg" (682 m)().
The summit region and the north and east mountainsides are within the municipality of Konzell. The southern mountainside is divided between the municipalities of Haibach, Haselbach and Rattiszell. Its western slopes belong to Stallwang.
Northwest of the summit of the Gallner Berg, at about 630 metres, is the farmstead of Gallner, which belongs to Konzell. Here is the daughter church of Saint Sixtus, built in the late 15th century.

Kim Naver

Karen-Margrethe (Kim) Naver (born 1940) is a Danish designer and textile artist, specializing in weaving and tapestry. Inspired by both coarse Polish techniques and patterns and materials from the Orient, she has been successful in creating textiles for industrial furniture manufacturers (Cotil, Paustian), as well as for domestic use (Royal Copenhagen). She is recognized as one of Denmark's leading figures in Danish modern textile art. Her silver jewellery designs have been marketed by Georg Jensen A/S.
Biography.
Born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 24 June 1940, Karen-Margrethe Naver is the daughter of the book dealer Rasmus Peder Pedersen Naver (1894–1976) and Christine Paula Claudia Oehlerich Petersen (1900–53). After matriculating from Øster Borgerdyd Gymnasium, in 1959 she moved to Paris where she studied history of art at the École du Louvre. On returning to Denmark, she attended "Skolen for Boligindretning" (Interior Design School) where she decided she wanted to make a career in textiles. In 1962, she became an apprentice with Lis Ahlmann, one of the most distinguished weavers of the day. A talented student, Naver mastered the various sewing and embroidery techniques so quickly that she was able to exhibit work at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1963.
The same year, she married the actor Peter Steen, giving birth to her first child Morten in 1964. She continued her education with Vibeke Klint, progressing to the stage where she was able to open her own workshop in 1966. The designs she had created as an apprentice were brought by the textile company Cotil for commercial production. Naver went on to win the Cotil Prize in 1969 and the Lunning Prize in 1970.
Around that time, Naver began experimenting with the coarser Polish weaving styles which had gained popularity, adopting new colours and widening her freedom of expression. In 1973, she met her second husband, the architect Mogens Breyen. Together they travelled to the Far East where she was inspired to adopt the intricate patterns and fine materials she discovered there. Her subsequent work, exhibited in a solo exhibition at the Danish Design Museum, initiated a new trend in decorative Danish textile art.
In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Naver served on several influential boards, including the Danish Arts Foundation, the School of Applied Arts and the Danish Handcraft Council. She was also a consultant to Haandarbejdets Fremme which played an important role in promoting Danish textile design. She also contributed textile designs to Royal Copenhagen and created silverware for Georg Jensen.
Among Naver's most important works are her five large tapestries in Danmarks Nationalbank, complementing Arne Jacobsen's architecture (1979), and the circular flat-woven rug she designed for A.P. Møller's headquarters (1980).
Awards.
Among Naver's many scholarships and awards are the Thorvald Bindesbøll Medal and the Order of the Dannebrog.

Trennfurt Roman Fort

The Trennfurt Roman Fort (German: "Kastell Trennfurt") is a "castrum" in the village of Trennfurt (now part of Klingenberg am Main) at the river Main in Bavaria. It belongs to the Main Limes as a part of the Unesco world heritage site Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes (German: "Obergermanisch-Raetischer Limes" or ORL) and has the number ORL 37.
Location.
The "castrum" is situated shortly north east of the old centre of the village Trennfurt. Visible terrain marks of the "castrum" do not exist at the site which mostly consists of garden land in private property. There are no buildings on the ground. But a small part of the north eastern edge of the "castrum" was built over by the railway in the 1870s.
Research.
Wilhelm Conrady, later section commissioner of the Imperial Limes Commission ("Reichslimeskommission", RLK), discovered the castrum in 1883 when he made excavations there. There have not been any further excavations since then. According to Conrady the castrum is made of stone, has a size of about 88 x 63 metres and a surface of about 0,6 hectares. This is the normal size of a castrum for a numerus.
It is unknown when the castrum was erected and how long it was occupied. It only can be dated from the 2nd to 3rd century AD.
Conrady examined a Roman votive stone, which was found in Trennfurt in the 18th century and which is walled in now inside the parish church of the village. He deciphered the inscription as "I(ovi) o(ptimo) m(aximo), Silvano cons(ervatori) Dianae Aug(ustae) vixill(atio) leg(ionis) XXII Anton (initianae) p(rimigeniae) p(iae) f(idelis) ag(entium) in lignari(i)s sub cur(a) Mamertini Iusti opt(ionis) d(edicavit) (duobus) Aspr(is) co(n)s(ulibus)". In English: "Consecrated to Jupiter, the best and greatest, to Silvanus the sustainer and to Diana the venerable by the special unit of the XXIIth legion Primigenia pia fidelis Antoniana, working in the forests under the command of Mamertinius Justus, when the two Aspers were consuls." The two Aspers were consuls in the year 212 AD.
So it is supposed that the "castrum" was near the place where the Roman soldiers prepared the wood for the transport on the Main, especially because an old branch of the river was only about 40 metres away from the eastern side of the fort. At the time of Conrady the branch already had vanished, but its traces still could be seen on the ground.
The castrum is protected as an archeological monument by Bavarian law. It has the monument number D-6-6221-0050.

Purdue University Global

Purdue University Global, Inc (PG) is an adult-serving public university, operating as a public-benefit corporation and part of the Purdue University system. With content delivered mostly online, Purdue University Global's programs focus on career-oriented fields of study at the credential, associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level. The university also has four physical classroom locations and Concord Law School.
Purdue Global was created in April 2018 from Purdue University's acquisition and rebranding of the former private for-profit Kaplan University. Kaplan continues to offer non-academic support services such as recruitment, admissions, human resources, marketing and technology support by contract, under the supervision of Purdue University, and most academic staff are former Kaplan employees. PG's academic headquarters are in West Lafayette, Indiana; its main campus (for accreditation purposes) is in Indianapolis, Indiana; and its online support centers are in Chicago and in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
History.
Following several years of significant enrollment decline, Graham Holdings Company (GHC) sold Kaplan University for one dollar in March 2018 to the Purdue University system, who rebranded the institution as Purdue University Global. Purdue agreed to employ Kaplan, Inc., a subsidiary of GHC, as the exclusive provider of nonacademic functions, and Kaplan, Inc. agreed to assume responsibility for liabilities resulting before the transaction. According to the contract terms, Kaplan receives 12.5 percent of the university's revenue, as long as funds are available after all operating expenses and guaranteed payments to Purdue have been covered.
Purdue University president, Mitch Daniels, announced the intent to acquire Kaplan University in April 2017. From 2017 to January 2018, the school's temporary placeholder name was NewU. Purdue University Global's lineage is rooted in a series of for-profit colleges: American Institute of Commerce (1937–1999), Quest College (1999–2000), and Kaplan College (2000–2004), later renamed Kaplan University (2004–2017). In the years prior to its sale to Purdue University, Kaplan University's parent company, Kaplan Inc., closed or sold several schools, including Kaplan College (a primarily brick and mortar vocational school, not to be confused with the online university that became Kaplan University in 2004), and Kaplan Career Institute, which were purchased by Education Corporation of America in 2015. Kaplan University was the last accredited higher education institution owned by Kaplan, Inc.
In 2017, Purdue president Mitch Daniels stated that the Purdue University deal with Kaplan incurred "virtually no financial risk", and had a "strong upside potential". Critics and analysts disagreed with Daniels' assessment, and in order to obtain regulatory approval the U.S. Department of Education required Purdue to assume responsibility for Kaplan University's debt and liability "whether they are known or unknown, and whether they accrue prior to, or after the closing of the transaction" noting the debts and liabilities backed by Purdue "constitute an instrumentality of the state of Indiana for the purpose of the department's regulations". In the acquisition agreement Kaplan agreed to assume responsibility for liabilities resulting before the transaction, however the U.S. Department of Education "ultimately holds Purdue and the state of Indiana responsible for liabilities resulting from the operation of Kaplan University". Through the acquisition, Kaplan guaranteed Purdue priority payments of $10 million a year for the first five years following the transaction, of which $20 million was paid upon closing.
In 2017, Purdue University President Mitch Daniels said that the contrast between the typical Purdue West Lafayette student and the targeted Purdue Global student was "stark." According to Purdue Global, 60 percent of Kaplan's students were over age 30, and the mean student income at enrollment was $22,323. For 55 percent of the students, neither parent attended college.
According to Purdue University, Purdue University Global had an $18 million loss in FY 2018, its first year of operation. Purdue University Treasurer Bill Sullivan said in regards to the 2018 finances, "losses are likely to continue another year, maybe two" and this was "a deliberate strategic choice and was, importantly, prefunded by Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) through the assets it brought to Purdue at acquisition" valued at more than $66 million in cash. Sullivan also stated that he expected "elevated startup costs to continue into 2019 and more modestly in 2020".
Graham Holdings Company, reported that it recorded $16.8 million in service fees with Purdue Global in 2018, based on an assessment of its collectability under the Transition and Operations Support Agreement. In April 2019, Purdue spokesman Tim Doty stated that Purdue University "has invested over $1 million so employees and their families can continue, complete or further their education" through Purdue University Global in the form an employee benefit that offers free tuition to all Purdue employees and their families.
In June 2018, it was estimated that Kaplan Higher Education would spend about $200 million on "back office services" and $100 million in marketing for Purdue Global. The Century Foundation claims that in 2016–17, before the change of management, the school spent 18 cents for instruction for every dollar of tuition received. Although Purdue Global has not stated the current ratio publicly, CFO Bill Sullivan dismissed such claims, saying lower costs are "the nature of the internet age. It also costs Amazon less to operate than Target and iTunes or Pandora less than your local record store."
In July 2019, Graham Holdings reported that Kaplan Higher Education's quarterly income had declined by 76 percent from the same period in 2018, caused by a combination of the sale to Purdue, Kaplan not qualifying for full reimbursement for it services from Purdue Global, and increased spending on marketing to support the launch of Purdue University Global. In January 2020, Purdue University reported Purdue Global's 2019 fiscal year numbers, showing a $43 million loss due to what it called "a deliberate one-time, $28.5 million marketing investment" as it launched the new university as well as "$9 million in accrued but unpaid KHE fee that won't need to be paid until the cash flow is positive". According to the university, only "$5.5 million was a loss from operations." Purdue Global projected that it would have an operating surplus in 2020.
In February 2020, Purdue University announced that Purdue Global would be holding a virtual reality component to its Los Angeles graduation ceremony. In March 2020, Frank Dooley replaced Betty Vandenbosch as chancellor of Purdue University Global.
In May 2020, Jon Harbor took over as provost of Purdue Global and Marilyn Wideman, dean of the School of Nursing, announced her retirement.
At least nine Purdue Global physical locations closed since Purdue took over from Kaplan. Following the management change that put Purdue in charge, six physical classroom spaces were closed in 2019, including Hagerstown, Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; St. Louis, Missouri; Cedar Falls, Iowa; Mason City, Iowa; and Omaha, Nebraska. In October 2020, PG announced that it would be closing its Lewiston, Maine, campus.
Academic relationships within Purdue System.
Purdue Global operates as a separately accredited institution within the Purdue University system, and is the only institution in the system operating as a public-benefit corporation. Each campus of the Purdue University system has its own accreditation, leadership, faculty, programs, and admissions policies. As a result, transfers between the campuses are highly limited. Purdue Global is classified by the U.S. Department of Education as a four-year public university but it does not receive state tax dollars due to its benefit corporation status, and it is exempt from some of the public records disclosure requirements of public universities in Indiana. According to the 2017 law that enabled Purdue or any other Indiana university to create an affiliated education institution, it still must report financial, academic and student success data to Indiana regulators, and any decisions made by the traditional side of Purdue or emails received by Purdue's administration remain eligible to the open records law, even if they pertain to Purdue Global.
With the exception of Purdue Global, all degrees from all Purdue University campuses and Purdue degree programs offered through Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis and Purdue Polytechnic Institute share a similar diploma bearing the name of the institution granting the degree and the city in which it is given. Purdue Global graduates receive a diploma that uses the name "Purdue University Global" instead of the system name, and bears the Purdue Global logo in place of the Purdue University seal. Purdue University and Purdue University Global share the same alumni association.
In July 2019, Purdue Polytechnic Institute announced it had received a $12 million grant from the US Department of Labor to enable 5,000 students to go through a cybersecurity apprenticeship program over the next four years. The Polytechnic Institute will partner with Purdue Global to offer online instruction nationwide for "nontraditional students" seeking work in the cybersecurity industry.
Campus and learning site locations.
Purdue University Global operates primarily online, though its main campus is in Indianapolis, Indiana. Purdue Global has additional learning sites in Iowa (Des Moines), Maine (Augusta), and Nebraska (Lincoln).
Finances.
Global receives revenues from student tuition, tuition from corporate partners, grant or scholarship aid, Title IV funds, GI Bill funds, and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance. Title IV funds include Pell Grants and federal student loans. The 2017–18 statistics are: 
In February 2020, Graham Holdings Company reported that Purdue University Global owed Kaplan Higher Education $68.4 million for services and deferred fees and $18.6 million for an advance from the Kaplan University transaction. In May 2020, Graham Holdings Company reported that Purdue University Global owed Kaplan Higher Education $82.0 million for services and deferred fees and $18.7 million for an advance from the Kaplan University transaction. In June 2020, Purdue Global owed a reported $89.6 million to Kaplan in addition to $19.1 million for the advance. By October 2020, Purdue Global's debt to Kaplan was reduced to $94 million, due to increased enrollments and the closing of campuses. In October 2020, Purdue University Global reported -$47 million in net assets, with a net operating loss of $103 million. In 2020, Purdue Global received $816,781 from the CARES Act and $15,423,168 in the second round of federal Coronavirus relief.
In February 2021, Graham Holdings reported that Purdue Global owed Kaplan Higher Education $107.2 million: $87.3 million for services, fees and deferred fees and $19.9 million for an advance to the school. Debts to Kaplan Higher Education were reduced to $88.6 million by March 31, 2021. In 2021, Purdue University Global received $25,504,589 in federal aid through the American Rescue Plan. By June 30, 2021, Purdue University's debt to Kaplan Higher Education was $87.8 million.
Offerings, enrollment, and student body.
Prior to Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University, Kaplan had undergone several years of significant enrollment decline from a high of 60,000 students in 2015 to just 32,000 students enrolled in April 2017. By the time, Kaplan University became Purdue University Global in April 2018, enrollment was "approximately 30,000". In 2019, President Daniels explained that due to an "overall market slowdown" Purdue Global was not yet “achieving the growth that we thought we might". As of January 2020, following a $130 million marketing spend, the university claimed to have begun to reverse the enrollment decline in its first year of operation, growing 5 percent or 1,422 students to a total of 31,042 enrolled with 11 percent growth for bachelor's and graduate students, along with a 17 percent decline in certificate students, and a 5 percent decline in associate degree students. Indiana residents are offered discounted tuition and Purdue employees and their families are offered free tuition.
Purdue Global is academically organized into seven schools:
Student body.
Approximately 17 percent of Purdue Global's student body are full-time students. The demographics of the student population are 65 percent female, 57 percent white, 21 percent black, 12 percent Hispanic, 2 percent Asian, 1 percent Pacific Islander, and 1 percent Native American. While the socio-economic diversity of Purdue University is 17 percent, the federal government has not yet reported a diversity number for Purdue Global. According to Purdue Global Chancellor Betty Vandenbosch, more than 28 percent of the student body is affiliated with the military, 52 percent are the first in their family to pursue a higher education degree, and 63 percent have a child or other dependent. About 4000 of Purdue Global's students are residents of Indiana.
Military servicemembers and veterans.
In 2019, Purdue Global ranked seventh in Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funding, with 6825 servicemembers using the benefits. Total DOD funding was $14,875,918. Purdue Global's student body in 2020 included about 7000 servicemembers and 5000 veterans. Members of the US Army, National Guard, Reserves, and veterans can obtain an AAS degree in small group management with six courses, a bachelor's degree in liberal studies with seven additional courses and a master's in management with 10 additional courses. In 2020, the National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education designated Purdue Global as a member school. PG is one of about 200 members.
Corporate partnerships.
In February 2019, Papa John's Pizza announced that all its employees would receive free tuition at Purdue Global. In June 2019, Walmart announced that Purdue Global would be one of six schools in their Live Better U education benefit program. The program is being marketed with the "chance to get a degree for the cost of a dollar a day." In June 2019, security services firm Securitas announced an arrangement to cover at least 90% of the tuition costs toward four custom certificate programs developed in partnership with Purdue Global. In October 2019, ManTech began offering its employees tuition-free access to Purdue Global's Bachelor of Science in analytics degree. In January 2020, Disney Aspire added Purdue University Global to its Network of Educational Providers. The program is managed by Guild Education. Other organizations that have announced partnerships with Purdue Global to offer their employees a tuition-free or reduced-tuition college degree include New Balance.
In September 2020, Purdue Global announced an agreement with Gallup "to develop and deliver an academic program to support Gallup's Straight to Business initiative...an undergraduate microcredential, aligned with and stackable into bachelor's degree opportunities in analytics, business administration, communication, and industrial/organizational psychology."
Academics.
Purdue University Global is an open admissions school that offers both traditional programs and standardized competency-based learning. This allows Purdue Global to offer college credit to students who can demonstrate they have mastered certain learning outcomes through professional and military training.
Accreditation.
Like Purdue's other campuses, Purdue Global is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific degree programs are accredited by the ACBSP, ABET, CCNE, AHIMA, NALA, and others. Its Master of Science degree in finance is also registered with the Certified Financial Planner board and qualifies graduates to sit the CFP examination. Purdue Global's law school, Concord Law School, is the only fully online law school in the country. Given that the American Bar Association does not accredit online universities, the school is unaccredited but students may still sit for the bar in California, or pursue an executive JD, designed for executives and others who seek graduate level training in law but do not wish to become attorneys.
Faculty and learning systems.
Following the acquisition, all Kaplan faculty became Purdue Global faculty which now include approximately 346 full-time faculty and 1,314 part-time faculty. Purdue University faculty are expected to become increasingly involved in launching programs and courses in the Purdue Global online system. To date, three new programs have been approved to be created in collaboration with Purdue's West Lafayette faculty including programs in pharmacy, and aviation.
Purdue University Global uses ExcelTrack, a competency-based learning program. The individualized computer program is used to cut costs and speed up student progress. Students may take as many courses as they want "all for one flat price."
Student outcomes.
According to the College Scorecard, Purdue University Global has a 33 percent graduation rate. Median salary after attending ranges from $21,000 (AA, teacher education) to $74,000 (BSN, nursing). Two years into student loan repayment, with Purdue Global students 32 percent were in forbearance, 29 percent were not making progress, 12 percent were in deferment, 11 percent defaulted, 6 percent were making progress, 6 percent were delinquent, 2 percent had their loans discharged, and 1 percent had paid in full.College Navigator reports an overall graduation rate of 22 percent. As of the first quarter of 2019, the pass rates of Purdue University Global nursing graduates exceed national averages, a new development since the takeover of Purdue of Kaplan University.
Rankings.
In 2020, Purdue Global ranked 388th out of 388 schools in the Washington Monthly list of national universities, with a social mobility ranking of 387th out of 388 schools.
Academic Partnerships.
Purdue Global has established transfer agreements with Anne Arundel Community College, Maricopa County Community College District and Iowa Lakes Community College.
Leadership and administration.
Mitch Daniels is the president of Purdue University Global. He reports to Purdue Global's board of trustees, which is appointed by the Purdue University board of trustees. Five of Purdue's University's trustees also serve on the Purdue Global board. Dr. Betty Vandenbosch serves as chancellor of Purdue Global and reports to the president of Purdue University and the six-member Purdue Global board of trustees. Vandenbosch previously was Dean of the School of Business and Information Technology at Kaplan University. Christopher Ruhl is the chief financial officer. Ruhl served as the senior vice president, chief financial officer, and general counsel at Ivy Tech Community College from 2012 to 2017. He also was director of the Indiana Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB), director of the Indiana State Budget Agency, and policy director and general counsel for the Indiana OMB under Governor Mitch Daniels.
On March 12, 2020, Purdue announced that Chancellor Betty Vandenbosch had resigned from her position effective April 3, 2020. On March 26, 2020, Purdue announced that Frank J. Dooley, PhD, previously Senior Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning at Purdue University, would take over as chancellor of Purdue University Global effective May 1, 2020.
Relationship with Kaplan Higher Education, Inc..
As a requirement of the purchase of Kaplan University from Graham Holdings, Purdue University Global is required to employ Kaplan Higher Education, Inc., for 30 years as the exclusive provider of "marketing and advertising, front-end student advising, admissions support, financial aid and student finance, international student recruitment, test preparation, business office, technology support, human resources, finance and accounting functions". The Purdue trustees retain management control and responsibility over these areas.
According to the contract terms, Kaplan would receive 12.5 percent of the university's revenue, as long as funds were available after all operating expenses and guaranteed payments to Purdue have been covered. Kaplan guaranteed Purdue $10 million every year for the first five years. Kaplan would make up the difference if PG revenues were insufficient. At the time of purchase, Kaplan's owners paid $20 million to Purdue, pursuant to that agreement. The agreement also stipulates that if Purdue alters the university's operations in a way that significantly reduces the school's revenues, Kaplan could seek reimbursement for 12.5 percent of the lost revenue. An independent financial analyst would be tasked to adjudicate the issue. Since the acquisition, Purdue's leadership has made several changes including closing several physical locations where Kaplan University had operated.
If Purdue Global were to incur $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years, or total cash operating losses of more than $75 million at any point, either Purdue or Kaplan Higher Education could terminate the contract. Upon termination, Purdue University Global would retain the assets that Kaplan contributed, but would also assume responsibility for any liability arising from the operation of the institution. Bob Shireman of the Century Foundation argued the cost of buying out of the 30-year deal is "prohibitive."
Kaplan Higher Education is also an online program manager (OPM) of the Purdue University system.
Praise and criticism.
In May 2017, the Purdue University Senate passed a resolution condemning the deal between Kaplan Higher Education and Purdue University. In September 2017, Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) warned that Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University posed major risks for Purdue University's students and reputation. They added that Kaplan has a “shameful record” as a “predatory” school. Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University, stated that the two senators were "misinformed". Regarding criticisms of Kaplan's for-profit days, Daniels quotes former Democratic senator Tom Harkin who led a massive 2011 investigation into the for-profit education sector but praised Kaplan for standing "alone among the large, for-profit education companies for having taken what are, in my opinion, real and significant steps to reduce high withdrawal rates and high default rates by implementing the Kaplan Commitment program."
In January 2018, the former Under Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, Ted Mitchell, praised the university that would become Purdue Global for its massive investments "in a learning platform that is, in my estimation, among the best in the country ... It is a 'lab' whose continued work promises insights not only for [Purdue Global] but for [Purdue University] and the wider field..." and that "Kaplan has been a pioneer in creating protections for students." Mitchell, the force behind Obama's Gainful Employment rules, also praised Kaplan for strong results and for taking action when they came up short, saying "Kaplan's results have been strong, and where they haven't, as in the failure of a number of their programs to meet the Gainful Employment thresholds, they have taken action to either remediate or close the programs...That's how we want institutions to react to troubling outcomes.” Arne Duncan, the former U.S. Secretary of Education under Obama who, with Mitchell, led a crackdown on the for-profit sector, praised the potential behind Purdue's acquisition of Kaplan University, saying “...I'm excited by this opportunity for a world-class university to expand its reach and help educate adult learners by acquiring a strong for-profit college. This is a first, and if successful, could help create a new model for what it means to be a land-grant institution.” Harvard researcher Todd Rogers praised the launch of Purdue Global for its potential to generate “more learning and greater scaled implementation of interventions that help students succeed" and that the university had "...a genuine commitment to using learning and motivational sciences to improve student outcomes, and to conducting high quality research to become a leader in contributing to those sciences".
On January 16, 2018, the Purdue Exponent editorial board stated that the Purdue University Global name was "downright deceitful" for using the Purdue name and not including the Kaplan name. In August 2018, former deputy undersecretary of education Bob Shireman called Purdue University Global "a for-profit college masquerading as a public university." Daniels pointed out that Shireman has been accused of misrepresenting facts in his criticisms and had been forced to leave the U.S. Department of Education under a cloud of accusations that he had colluded with short-sellers attempting to reduce stock values in the for-profit sector. PG initially required students to waive most rights to sue the school and submit disputes to arbitration. The American Association of University Professors called this policy “the stuff of predatory for-profit colleges, not a leading public research institution”. The AAUP petitioned the Higher Learning Commission, the school's accrediting body, on this issue. In September 2018, Senators Durbin and Brown called for Purdue to get rid of that policy, which came from the Kaplan rulebook. The policy was eliminated within the first year of the acquisition.
In January 2019, the "Purdue Exponent" stated that faculty were not consulted on the deliberations for the Purdue Global acquisition. Biologist David Sanders, a Purdue professor, university senate member, and local Democratic politician, hypothesized that the deal was enacted to help pay for the tuition freeze at the West Lafayette campus or that "'certain people see this as the future. I refer to it as the Walmart-ization of higher education...It's cheap, it's fast, but in two years, it'll be broken. The same thing is true with this sort of education.'" Sanders added he was concerned about Purdue University Global's $100 million marketing budget. That same month, professors at Purdue University complained that Purdue Global was enrolling traditional students, which was in opposition to what Global had originally promised. The PG chancellor responded while there was no formal policy that prevented a full-time, traditional student from enrolling in a course as a non-degree seeking student, it was not the university's intent to enroll such students, and that only five of PG's 29,000 students enrolled in a single course in 2018. In May 2019, three professors claimed that Purdue University Global was draining Purdue University's branch campuses, and the deal with Kaplan Higher Education was "online folly. Purdue University CFO Bill Sullivan responded that the degree to which the piece "misread Purdue's financial statements and distorted both the financial state and mission of Purdue Global is truly disappointing and unfortunate." Sullivan added that "In negotiating the acquisition of Kaplan University, we crafted an agreement that provided a nearly impenetrable defense of Purdue's finances.
In January 2020, the Chronicle of Higher Education published a report on Purdue Global titled :Purdue Global Has Had a Rocky Start. Is It Growing Pains or a Sign of Trouble?: In September 2020, the Century Foundation "raised questions about the documents Purdue University Global presented to the Internal Revenue Service when it applied for tax-exempt status in August 2019." Purdue University denied the claims.
In the February issue of Emergency Medical News, two doctors questioned the vetting process of Purdue Global's nursing masters degree programs, which admitted all 500 applicants in Fall, 2019.
In a 2021 Chronicle of Higher Education article called The Great Master's Degree Swindle, Kevin Carey said "If you want to pay more and get less, go to a for-profit school like DeVry, the University of Phoenix, or Purdue Global."

Carcassonne and Trèbes attack

On 23 March 2018, there was a series of Islamist terrorist attacks in the towns of Carcassonne and Trèbes in southern France. Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old French-Moroccan (born 11 April 1992 in Taza, Morocco), shot the two occupants of a car in Carcassonne, killing the passenger and hijacking it. He then opened fire on four police officers, seriously wounding one. Lakdim drove to nearby Trèbes, where he stormed a Super U supermarket, killing two civilians, wounding others, and taking at least one hostage. He swore allegiance to the Islamic State and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the only surviving suspect of the November 2015 Paris attacks.
A senior gendarmerie officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, voluntarily swapped places with a hostage. After a three-hour stand-off, Lakdim shot and fatally stabbed Beltrame. A police tactical unit immediately stormed the building and killed Lakdim. He was named a "soldier of the Islamic State" by the Amaq News Agency, and the President of France called the attacks an act of Islamist terrorism. Five people were killed in the attacks, including the perpetrator, and fifteen were wounded.
Events.
Carcassonne attacks.
Shortly before 10 a.m. (9 a.m. UTC) on Friday 23 March 2018, Redouane Lakdim, armed with a handgun, stopped a car on the outskirts of Carcassonne that was occupied by Renato Silva, of Portugal, and Jean Mazières. Lakdim shot both occupants, killing Mazières and critically injuring Silva, then stole the car and drove off. He appeared to wait outside a military barracks for soldiers, but then drove to a police barracks and attacked four police officers as they were jogging back to their barracks by shooting at and trying to run them over. One of the officers was shot, but the bullet narrowly missed his heart and instead broke a few ribs and punctured a lung. Lakdim then sped off and drove to Trèbes.
Trèbes hostage crisis.
At around 11 a.m. Lakdim entered the Super U supermarket in Trèbes armed with a handgun, a hunting knife and three homemade bombs. There were about fifty people inside. He shouted "Allahu akbar", and declared he was a soldier of Islamic State and that he was willing to "die for Syria". He shot dead two people—a supermarket worker and a customer—and took others hostage, ordering everyone to lie on the ground. Most of those in the supermarket managed to flee and some hid in a cold store. Hundreds of police and gendarmerie quickly arrived, cordoned off the area and helped to evacuate people. They found Lakdim holding several hostages, including a woman whom he used as a human shield. A GIGN unit assembled near the supermarket and Interior Minister Gérard Collomb arrived. Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, a primary suspect in the November 2015 Paris attacks. During the standoff, he briefly came out of the supermarket, threatening to "blow everything up". Police brought Lakdim's mother and two sisters to negotiate, unsuccessfully.
Police negotiated with Lakdim to release the hostages, and Arnaud Beltrame, a 44-year-old lieutenant colonel in the National Gendarmerie, offered to take the place of the final, female hostage, and Lakdim agreed. Beltrame set his mobile phone on a table inside with the phone line open, so the police outside could listen in. After a three-hour stand-off, Beltrame tried to disarm Lakdim and shouted "Assault! Assault!" loud enough to be heard through the phone. As a result, Beltrame was shot three or four times and fatally stabbed, while GIGN operatives immediately stormed the supermarket at 2:40 p.m. and exchanged gunfire with the assailant, killing him two minutes later. Two of the operatives were wounded. Shortly after, police dogs went into the building, and an ambulance and helicopter arrived in the car park. Beltrame was praised by Interior Minister Collomb and others for his heroism, but later died in hospital of his injuries. Autopsies found that Beltrame died from stab wounds to the throat.
Suspect.
The suspect was identified as Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old French-Moroccan man who was born in Morocco. He lived in Carcassonne with his parents and sisters, and regularly attended the Carcassonne mosque. He had been convicted twice for petty crimes, and had served one month in prison in 2016. Lakdim was very active on Salafist social networks and had been on a watchlist of suspected Islamist extremists since 2014. He was a small time drug dealer. He had been under surveillance for his "radicalism and proximity to Salafist movements" but had showed no signs he was going to carry out an attack. After his death in Trèbes, police raided his home as well as those of his friends and relatives and interviewed neighbours, one of whom described him as a "pleasant young man". Interior Minister Gérard Collomb believes he acted alone. A search of his home found notes referring to Islamic State, in what appeared to be a will. His girlfriend was known to French security services.
Aftermath.
Renato Silva survived being shot in the head by Lakdim before having his car stolen, and was taken to Perpignan where he went into a coma. On 4 April, he came out of the coma but could not walk unassisted and suffered partial paralysis in the face and deafness in one ear. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited Silva in hospital. He was released on 23 March and returned to his home in Villemoustaussou, Aude.
On 19 October 2018, three persons were indicted by French authorities in connection to Lakdim's actions.
Reactions.
French Minister of the Interior Gérard Collomb, who was briefed on the situation in Trèbes from Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or, said he was "on his way to Trèbes" and arrived shortly after. President Emmanuel Macron said the hostage taking "appeared to be a terrorist act" and that he would return to Paris within hours to coordinate an official response.
President Macron later said Arnaud Beltrame "fell as a hero" and showed "exceptional courage", in what he described as an act of "Islamist terrorism".
Beltrame's name was the top trending hashtag on the French edition of Twitter on the morning he died due to tributes from France and elsewhere around the world. Gendarmerie stations across France flew flags at half-mast in his honour, and the Élysée Presidential Palace announced that a national tribute would be paid to him.

HMS Valkyrie (shore establishment)

HMS "Valkyrie" was a shore establishment or "stone frigate" of the Royal Navy located in Douglas, Isle of Man. The establishment was split into two component parts, "Valkyrie" I and "Valkyrie" II.
History.
HMS "Valkyrie" was established as the Royal Navy's No. 1 Radar Training School, its personnel billeted in a number of guest houses which had been requisitioned for the duration and which were situated on Loch Promenade, Douglas. The training was undertaken at a series of buildings on Douglas Head, one being the Douglas Head Hotel, and one of which today is occupied by Manx Radio.
HMS "Valkyrie" was commissioned in October 1941. Much of the early work involving Radar took place at Douglas Head with investment in the required equipment totaling £3,000,000 (£146,864,930 as of 2018).
The training school worked in conjunction with a Sea Hurricane of the Fleet Air Arm which belonged to 772 Squadron (FAA) and was based at RAF Andreas. The aircraft was employed to provide simulated attack conditions. The Hurricane was replaced in October 1944, after crashing on Douglas Head, killing the pilot Sub Lieutenant Robert Paton.
During the operation of No. 1 Radar Training School, Douglas Head was closed to the public which meant no access to Port Soderick was available via the Marine Drive, which had been a popular recreational area for tourists before the war.
HMS "Valkyrie" II.
HMS "Valkyrie" II was commissioned in September 1943, to train signal men and wireless telegraphy ratings for landing craft assembling for D-Day as existing establishments could not provide sufficient personnel in time.
To meet this requirement men were transferred from the Army and RAF, and at the peak period 2,500 ratings were under training on a six months course. The messing problem of this huge commitment was solved by supplying the food from naval sources and cooking it at the Empress and Palace hotels under the supervision of civilian contractors. The Palace Dance Hall was converted into a vast mess hall where 1,200 ratings could sit down together for a meal. 
A section of Douglas Beach was closed off to the public for training, much of which necessarily took place outdoors. 
By the time of the Invasion of France, "Valkyrie" II's function had ceased and the establishment was paid off in March 1944.
Decommissioning.
On the cessation of hostilities plans were put in place to decommission HMS "Valkyrie". At 16:00hrs on Monday 30 December 1946, the White Ensign at HMS "Valkyrie" was lowered for the last time. The premises on Douglas Promenade were vacated and this was followed by the premises on Douglas Head which were vacated on 31 January 1947, at the conclusion of the decommissioning ceremony.
During the lifetime of HMS "Valkyrie" over 30,000 naval ratings passed through the Royal Navy's No. 1 Radar Training School.
French Detachment.
HMS "Valkyrie" was responsible for the training of Radar operators from various countries and in addition it became home to a detachment from the French Navy who underwent Radar training at the establishment. Under the command of Lieutenant Jean Colin, the detachment arrived at the commencement of the "Valkyrie's" commission and from June 1943 over 400 French sailors were trained in Douglas.

Steve Sullivan (basketball)

Stephen Sullivan (July 20, 1944 – August 27, 2014) was an American professional basketball player. Sullivan played collegiately for the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team and was the 14th overall pick in the 1967 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons. Sullivan was also drafted by the Pittsburgh Pipers in the 1967 ABA Draft. Sullivan was a member of the USA Basketball Gold Medal teams of the 1967 Pan-American Games and 1967 World University Games.
Early life.
Born in Newark, New Jersey and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Sullivan attended Essex Catholic High School, graduating in 1963. He then enrolled at Georgetown University.
College basketball career.
Sullivan suffered an severe ankle injury and averaged only 7.1 points over 18 games in his first varsity season (1964-1965) at Georgetown. In 1965-66 he led the team in scoring (15.1) and rebounding (9.7).
In 1966–67, Sullivan scored in double figures in 21 of 23 games, scored 20 or more points 10 times and averaged 18.6 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. That season, Sullivan had 33 and 17 against American University, 26 points with 23 rebounds vs. Syracuse University, and had 18 and 16 vs. Seton Hall in his final game. He is one of only seven Georgetown players ever to lead the team in scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons. Sullivan graduated from Georgetown as the school's seventh all-time scorer, second all time rebounder, and the highest NBA draft pick to date in program history. Sullivan remained the highest Georgetown NBA pick until Sleepy Floyd was the 13th pick of the 1982 NBA Draft. Both were surpassed when Patrick Ewing was the first pick of the 1985 NBA Draft.
Sullivan was selected as a member of the USA Basketball Gold Medal teams of the 1967 Pan Am games and 1968 World University Games. The USA Team for the Pan-Am games captured the gold medal by going 9–0 with the Gold Medal Game victory over Mexico. The 1967 World University Team also won the gold medal, going 7–0, defeating Brazil 91–38 in the Gold Medal Game. Sullivan averaged 7.2 points in the Games. Sullivan's teammates on both squads included his future Detroit fellow draft pick Sonny Dove, Jo Jo White and Wes Unseld.
Professional career.
Sullivan was drafted by the ABA's Pittsburgh Pipers in the 1967 ABA Draft. Pittsburgh had just signed Connie Hawkins at power forward, so Sullivan waited for the NBA draft that summer. Selected 14th in the draft by the Detroit Pistons in an overall draft that included Earl Monroe, Pat Riley, Clem Haskins, Walt Frazier, and Phil Jackson, the Pistons had two of the first four overall picks. The Pistons drafted Jimmy Walker with the first overall pick, then drafted Sonny Dove with the 4th overall pick. The Pistons opted to sign Dove over Sullivan.
Later, Sullivan spent nine years professionally playing in Italy and Spain, receiving numerous MVP awards.
Death.
After living and working for 45 years in Spain, Italy and England, Sullivan passed away in London, England on August 27, 2014 surrounded by his family.

Thursday the 12th

Thursday the 12th is a four-part British television crime drama series, written by Paula Milne and directed by Charles Beeson, that was due to be broadcast on ITV1 in 2000.
The series focuses on the Bannister family, whose lives are turned upside down when an unidentified body is found in the grounds of their estate. As an investigative TV reporter takes on the case, Marius Bannister (Ciarán Hinds), a wealthy dentist and politician, his wife Nina (Maria Doyle Kennedy), their troubled adopted teenaged son Martin (Jim Sturgess), and Nina's predatory sister Candice Hopper (Elizabeth McGovern) all come under suspicion.
Broadcast.
The series was originally set to broadcast as two feature-length episodes, but due to local elections taking place on the day the first episode was due to be broadcast, 4 May 2000, the series was pulled from the schedules at the last minute, on the grounds that it may be in breach of rules on political bias. Although it was later rescheduled for broadcast in the winter of 2000/2001, the series was once again pushed back, and was set to premiere in June 2001, although due to the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001, the General Election due to take place in May was put back to 7 June, and the series was subsequently pulled from the schedules once more, and remains unbroadcast in the United Kingdom. The series was shown as part of a season showcasing Paula Milne's work at the BFI in London on 14 September 2012.
For international broadcast and release on DVD, the series was re-edited into four episodes, each focusing on the story of a single character. In the United States, the series premiered on Bravo on 4 June 2003. The series was also broadcast in Australia on UKTV. The series was released on Region 1 DVD on 25 September 2007.

The Open Window (Bonnard)

The Open Window is a work by the French artist Pierre Bonnard, painted in 1921. Depicting a scene in a room, the painting draws the viewer's focus to the natural landscape outside of the window, away from the figures in the bottom right. The work is currently housed in The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C..
Subject and composition.
The contrast between the exterior blues and greens and the interior red oranges keeps the viewer's focus away from the black cat and woman at the lower right corner of the canvas. Dogs and cats are a signature that are found in all of his works. It takes a while for the viewer to find the woman's head in chair. Her hair is palish blue like the canvas of the chair and her face the same red as the wall behind. This suggested human presence, like some figure in a dream, became a feature of these inside-outside views that Bonnard painted in the 1930s. The human figure is believed to be Bonnard's wife Marthe de Meligny but may also be Renee Monchaty, with whom he fell in love around 1917 and who killed herself in 1923. Many accounts describe Monchaty as being Bonnard's ideal statuesque model for his paintings.
Bonnard's work was painted from memory rather than from life, which accounts for the semi-realistic view of his paintings. Bonnard's studies of the domestic interior and its psychological charge, a reflection upon his private life, is evident in his work. In his interiors, a sense of longing is concentrated in open windows to the outside world. In "The Open Window", color and light transfigure a room in the artist’s house in Normandy. The focal point of the painting is the void in the middle, the sky, the foliage, and the outside shadow enclosed by the window despite the painting giving more space to the walls.
Collection.
The painting as of 2018 remains under the curation of the Phillips Collection.

The Distraction Pieces Podcast is a weekly conversational podcast created and hosted by English spoken word poet and hip-hop artist Scroobius Pip. The podcast began on 13 October 2014 and has been released weekly ever since.
Format.
The podcasts are usually around one hour in duration and are released every Wednesday. Pip switched to this format from his radio show on Xfm after appearing on "The Joe Rogan Experience" and hearing other American long-form interview podcasters such as Marc Maron. Speaking with "The Observer"'s Killian Fox, Pip described the podcast as "interesting conversations with interesting people", adding "obviously it's important to have some big names in there, such as Simon Pegg, Alan Moore and Billy Bragg, but we've also had people such as Dr Suzi Gage, who studies recreational drugs and their potential benefits and negatives, and the mortician Carla Valentine talking about the taboo of death. It can get incredibly heavy – we've had debates about race and mental health – but there's also a lot of silly nonsense". Pip bookends each episode with monologues in which he mentions sponsors for the show, updates the listener on his work, and reflects on the conversations in the podcasts.
Distraction Pieces Network.
"The Distraction Pieces Podcast" is the flagship podcast of the eponymous network organised by Pip. Other shows on the network include Brett Goldstein's "Films to Be Buried With", Suzi Gage's "Say Why to Drugs", Jason Reed's "Stop and Search", in association with LEAP UK, and Jim Smallman's "Tuesday Night Jaw".

1896 United States presidential election in Colorado

The 1896 United States presidential election in Colorado took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Colorado voters chose four electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background.
In its early days as a state, Colorado had like the Plains States to its east been solidly Republican. However, with crises emerging in its agricultural sector from low wheat prices and a severe drought in 1888 and 1889, and the state’s underdevelopment leading to resentment of the Northeast, the new Populist Party was able to largely take over the state’s politics in the early 1890s. Aided by fusion with the minority Democratic Party and strong support for free silver in this state which produced over half of all American silver, the Populist Party under James B. Weaver in 1892 carried the state’s presidential electoral votes and won both its congressional seats. After the Republicans gained a 130-seat majority in the House of Representatives following the 1894 elections, five dissident Republicans from the Mountain States who supported free silver jointed together as the “Silver Republicans” They supported nominating Centennial State Senator Teller at first, but ultimately this was viewed as impractical and the Silver Republicans fused with Democrat/Populist William Jennings Bryan.
Bryan’s support for free silver against the existing gold standard supported by Republican nominee William McKinley ensured he had virtually unanimous support from Colorado’s silver-dependent business elite.
Vote.
Once a fusion between Democrats, Populists and Silver Republicans was fully finalised, there was no campaigning in Colorado as all polls showed Bryan would carry the state very easily. Bryan in the end carried Colorado by more than seventy percentage points, by over twenty percent the best performance by any presidential candidate in the history of the state. Bryan carried all but two of Colorado’s counties, and won nineteen with over ninety percent of the vote, with McKinley retaining significant support only on the eastern High Plains, where the power of the silver magnates was much less.
Bryan would win Colorado against William McKinley again in 1900 and would later also win the state against William Howard Taft in 1908, making the state one of just two western states Bryan would carry in all three of his runs (the other being Nevada).

Isola Razzoli Lighthouse

Isola Razzoli Lighthouse () is an active lighthouse located on an 
islet, long, in the Maddalena archipelago. The lighthouse is the northernmost in Sardinia, on the eastern approach to the Strait of Bonifacio, and is at from the French Lavezzi archipelago. The island is in the municipality of La Maddalena on the Tyrrhenian Sea.
Description.
The first lighthouse was built in 1858 and consisted of a masonry quadrangular tower, high, with balcony and lantern atop a 2-storey keeper's house. The tower and the lantern were painted in white, the lantern dome in grey metallic. The lighthouse was abandoned when it started to ruin and was understood that was too much expensive to renovate it. In 2007 a European Commission granted funds for a partial renovation of the building, but it seem that most of the work is to be done. The current and active lighthouse was built in 1974 and consists of a stone tapered cylindrical tower, high, with balcony an lantern. The tower is unpainted, the balcony is white and the lantern dome in grey metallic. The light is positioned at above sea level and emits one white or red flash, depending on the directions, in a 2.5 seconds period visible up to a distance of . The lighthouse is completely automated, powered by a solar unit and managed by the Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park with the identification code number 1000 E.F.

Phramongkutklao Hospital

Phramongkutklao Hospital () is a hospital located in Ratchathewi District, Bangkok, Thailand. It is a military hospital for the Royal Thai Army and a teaching hospital for Phramongkutklao College of Medicine which trains doctors for the Royal Thai Armed Forces, as well as the Royal Thai Army Nursing College.
History.
After the Siamese revolution of 1932 which changed Thailand from an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy, Maj. Luang Thurawaithayawiset, chief doctor of the forces based at Paruskavan Palace, sought to find a medical facility to treat and care for army soldiers and thus proposed to Col. Phraya Songsuradet to find a location. Three locations were surveyed: Phaya Thai Palace, Bang Khun Phrom Palace and the Army Survey Department. The location was finally settled at Phaya Thai Palace and King Prajadhipok approved of this project. Medical Corps Group 1 (Pak Khlong Lot) and Medical Corps Group 2 (Bang Sue) were then merged into the 'Bangkok Military District Medical Corps', with Lt. Col. Luang Winitwetchakarn as commander. The facility was opened on 26 November 1932 as the 'Bangkok Military District Medical Corps Division' and was attended by Gen. Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena and was used as the headquarters for the medical corps. The facility was developed with assistance from the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University and Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital. By 1933, the name was changed to 'Military District 1 Medical Corps Division'.
During World War II, the hospital was closed to general patient admissions and was used solely as a military hospital. After the war, the need for an improved quality of care as well as increased education for military medicine was highlighted. On 1 January 1946, the division became the 'Army Hospital' and operations were transferred directly to the Army Medical Department. The hospital also reopened back for public use. On 8 August 1952, the hospital was renamed 'Phramongkutklao Hospital', in following the name of King Vajiravudh, who had built Phaya Thai Palace.
On 22 May 2017, Phramongkutklao Hospital was bombed, causing 21 injuries. This day was exactly three years after the 2014 Thai coup d'état.
The hospital is under the patronage of Princess Bajrakitiyabha.

Dilhan Eryurt

Dilhan Eryurt (29 November 1926 – 13 September 2012) was a Turkish astrophysicist who made major contributions to scientific research on the formation and evolution of the Sun and other main sequence stars.
From 1961 to 1973, Eryurt worked for NASA, performing research for the Apollo program. She then established the astrophysics department at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey. She was the Dean of METU's science and literature faculty from 1988 to 1993.
Early life.
Eryurt was born on 29 November 1926 in İzmir, Turkey. Her father was , who was a member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey for Denizli Province in 1944.
Shortly after her birth in İzmir, Eryurt's family moved to Istanbul, and then to Ankara a few years later. After completing her primary education in Ankara, she continued to Ankara Girls' High School. In high school, she had a special interest in mathematics. For this reason, after graduating from high school, she enrolled in the Istanbul University Department of Mathematics and Astronomy. She pursued her interest in astronomy during her university studies.
Career.
After graduating from Istanbul University in 1946, Eryurt worked as an honorary assistant for two years for Tevfik Oktay Kabakçıoğlu. She was assigned to open an Astronomy Department at Ankara University. She continued her graduate studies at the University of Michigan, and in 1953 she completed her doctorate at the Ankara University Department of Astrophysics where she became Associate Professor.
In 1959, Eryurt went to Canada for two years on scholarship from the International Atomic Energy Agency. Here she worked with Alastair G. W. Cameron. Although she had learned mathematics in Turkey, she had not worked with computers. She studied books in Canada and the US, teaching herself how to make use of computers for her work. She then went to the US and worked for the Soroptimist Federation of America at Indiana University, and on the identification of stellar models at the Goethe Link Observatory, working with Marshall Wrubel. After this experience, Eryurt worked at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. She collaborated with Alastair G. W. Cameron, on research on solar evolution. During this period, she was the only woman astronomer working at the institution.
Eryurt's work at the Goddard Institute revealed some facts about the Sun that were not understood until then. The existing theory that the brightness of the Sun was much lower at its formation, 4.5 billion years ago, was under scrutiny. It was revealed that the Sun was actually much brighter and warmer in the past and decreased to its current level. The studies were important at that time to influence the course of scientific and engineering research aims of new space flights. She was awarded the Apollo Achievement Award in 1969 for her successful work contributing to the achievement of the Apollo 11 mission's first landing on the moon and subsequent lunar exploration, by providing NASA engineers with crucial information for modelling solar impact on the lunar environment.
After completing her two-year research study at the Goddard Institute, Eryurt continued to work at the institute as a Senior Researcher. The institute sent her to the University of California to work on a research study about the formation and development of main sequence stars.
In 1968, she came to Turkey and organised the first National Astronomy Congress with the support of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK).
Between 1969 and 1973, Eryurt continued her scientific research work at NASA. In 1973, she returned to the Middle East Technical University Physics Department and founded the Astrophysics Branch. In 1977, she was awarded with the TÜBİTAK Science Award. In 1988, she was Chairperson of the Physics Department for six months, and then became the Dean of the Faculty of Science and Literature for five years. She retired in 1993.
Death.
Eryurt died in Ankara from a heart attack on 13 September 2012 at the age of 85.
Posthumous recognition.
Eryurt was honoured with a Google Doodle on 20 July 2020 in commemoration of the 51st anniversary of the first manned landing on the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as part of the Apollo 11 mission.

St. Augustine Historical Society

The St. Augustine Historical Society (SAHS) is a membership organization committed to the preservation and interpretation of historically significant structures, artifacts, and documentary materials related to St. Augustine, Florida. Formally organized on New Years Day 1883, SAHS is the oldest continuously operating museum and historical society in Florida. In 1899, the society purchased the Vedder Museum on Bay Street where it exhibited historical and scientific curiosities until losing its holdings in the Saint Augustine Fire of 1914. In 1920, SAHS successfully lobbied for federal restoration of Fort Matanzas, and in 1965, it played a significant role in the restoration of numerous historic sites in preparation for the St. Augustine quadricentennial.
The Society has been a primary force in the preservation and care of four historic Spanish colonial homes, including the González-Alvarez House (The Oldest House), the Tovar House, and the Fernandez-Llambias House—all on Saint Francis Street—as well as the Segui-Kirby Smith House on the corner of Aviles Street and Artillery Lane. SAHS publishes "El Escribano: The St. Augustine Journal of History", as well as the Society’s newsletter the "East Florida Gazette".
The Oldest House Museum.
The González-Alvarez House is the oldest surviving Spanish colonial dwelling in St. Augustine, with evidence dating the site's occupancy from the 1600s, and the present house to the early 1700s. The house is located at 14 Saint Francis Street and exhibits both Spanish and British colonial architectural details and styles. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970. The Oldest House Museum Complex includes the Tovar House, the Webb Museum, the Page L Edwards Gallery, an ornamental garden, and a museum store. First exhibited as a house museum in 1892, the building was acquired in 1918 by the Saint Augustine Historical Society.
Research Library.
The SAHS Research Library at the Segui-Kirby Smith House specializes in the history of St. Augustine, colonial East Florida, and Saint Johns County. The collection includes maps, photographs, vertical subject files, church records, circuit court cases, city government records, manuscript collections, circuit court records, and biographical files. It is a closed-stack library with a small reference collection in the main reading room, and is free to the public. The two hundred and thirty year-old building was built as a private residence and was the birthplace of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith (1824). It was given in trust to the St. Augustine Library Association in 1895, and was a free public library until Saint Johns County erected a new facility in 1984.
"El Escribano".
Since January 1955, "El Escribano" ("The Scribe") has been the annual publication of SAHS sent to members and libraries. The name is derived from the city's Spanish colonial history:

John Alden Shoudy

John Alden Shoudy was an American businessman and politician, known as an early settler and founder of Ellensburg, Washington.
Early life.
Shoudy was born in Illinois in 1841, the son of Israel and Rebecca Hemstreet Shoudy, both originally from the Albany, New York area. He fought in the American Civil War for three years, and after the war he moved to California with his brother-in-law, Dexter Horton.
Career.
He married Mary Ellen Stuart and moved to Seattle. He went to the Kittitas Valley in 1871 as businesspeople in Seattle were interested in building a road from Seattle to the Kittitas Valley. He purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson "A.J." Splawn, called "Robber's Roost", which was the first business in the valley established by Splawn a year earlier to trade with the local Indians. The location of the structure commemorated by a placard and small stone monument. Shoudy decided to stay in Kittitas Valley and built a cabin there. Although Shoudy was not the first settler in the Kittitas Valley, he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh and named the streets in what would become the downtown district. He filed an 80-acre plat for the town on July 20, 1875 and named it after his wife Mary Ellen as Ellensburgh (the final H was later dropped). Plots of land were then sold to new settlers and businessmen coming to the area. He was a member of the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1883, and played a role in the formation of Kittitas County.
Death.
Shoudy died on May 25, 1901.

Hexie (train)

Hexie (), also known as the CRH series EMU, or as the Hexie Hao, is an umbrella term for the multiple unit high-speed and higher-speed trains operated by China Railway under the China Railway High-speed brand. All series of Hexie are based on foreign-developed technology and later manufactured locally in China through technology transfer licenses, with the ultimate goal of China acquiring the know-how and capability to produce high-speed rail trains.
The Harmony series does not belong to any single platform, instead encompassing all high-speed trains in China with roots in foreign technology, specifically CRH1, CRH2, CRH3 and CRH5. Although later variants of Hexie such as CRH380A were designed by Chinese companies, they are still classified as CRH due to incorporation of foreign technology.
History.
In 2007, China's Ministry of Railways drafted a plan for China's future high-speed network. Bombardier Transportation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Alstom and later Siemens joined the high-speed train manufacturing project that later became known as Harmony. Forming joint-ventures with Chinese company CNR and CSR, these four foreign companies signed agreements with China to manufacture high-speed trains for China as well as provide assistance for Chinese companies to manufacture train cars locally in the future.
While the initial train sets from each Hexie series were manufactured overseas, subsequent sets are manufactured locally through technology transfer, a key requirement for China. The signalling, track and support structures, control software, and station design are developed domestically with foreign elements as well. Although the first domestically produced trains were initially delivered in complete knock-down form, eventually manufacturing as a whole became predominantly Chinese.
China currently holds many patents related to the internal components of these trains, re-designed in China to allow the trains to run at higher speeds than the foreign designs allowed. However, these patents are only valid within China, and as such hold no international power. This weakness on the intellectual property of Hexie trains became an obstruction for China to export its high-speed rail related products, leading to the development of a completely redesigned train brand, Fuxing, which is based on indigenous technologies.
While most Hexie series trains are designed for China Railway, a variant of the CRH380A has been modified for operation by MTR Corporation of Hong Kong, who will operate these trains under the brand Vibrant Express specifically for the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link.
Variants.
The "Harmony" brand has different electric multiple unit trainsets, the designs for which are imported from other nations and designated CRH-1 through CRH-5 and CRH380A(L), CRH380B(L), and CRH380C(L). CRH trainsets are intended to provide fast and convenient travel between cities. Some of the trainsets are manufactured locally through technology transfer, a key requirement for China. The signalling, track and support structures, control software, and station design are developed domestically with foreign elements as well, so the system as a whole is predominantly Chinese. China currently holds many new patents related to the internal components of these trains, re-designed in China to allow the trains to run at higher speeds than the foreign designs allowed. However, these patents are only valid within China, and as such hold no international power.
The trainsets are as follows:
CRH1A, B,E, CRH2A, B,E, and CRH5A are designed for a maximum operating speed (MOR) of 200 km/h and can reach up to 250 km/h. CRH3C and CRH2C designs have an MOR of 300 km/h, and can reach up to 350 km/h, with a top testing speed more than 380 km/h. However, in practical terms, issues such as maintenance costs, comfort, and safety make the maximum speed of more than 380 km/h impractical and remain limiting factors.

The Garrick Cinema—periodically referred to as the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre, Andy Warhol's Garrick Cinema, Garrick Theatre, Nickelodeon—was a 199-seat movie house located in Greenwich Village at 152 Bleecker Street, Lower Manhattan, New York City. Andy Warhol debuted many of his notable films (including "Bike Boy" (1967), "Blue Movie" (1969), "Flesh" (1968), "Lonesome Cowboys" (1968), "Loves of Ondine" (1967) and others) in this building (as well as in other area theaters, including the 55th Street Playhouse) in the late 1960s. 
Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention played here nightly for 6 months in 1967. 
The Cafe Au Go Go was located in the "basement" of the theater building in the late 1960s, and was a prominent Greenwich Village night club, featuring many well known musical groups, folksingers and comedy acts.
Warhol years.
As an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at "The Factory", Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).
During the 1960s, Andy Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation "Superstars", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as poet John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre or the 55th Street Playhouse) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck).
Cafe Au Go Go.
The "Cafe Au Go Go" was a Greenwich Village night club located in the "basement" of the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre at 152 Bleecker Street. The club featured many well known musical groups, folksingers and comedy acts between the opening in February 1964 until closing in October 1969. The club was originally owned by Howard Solomon who sold it in June 1969 to Moses Baruch. Baruch closed the club in October 1969. Howard Solomon became the manager of singer Fred Neil.
The club was the first New York City venue for the Grateful Dead. Richie Havens and the Blues Project were weekly regulars as well as Harvey Brooks who was bass player in residence, The Stone Poneys featuring Linda Ronstadt played frequently. The Grateful Dead played 10 times in 1967 and 3 in 1969. Jimi Hendrix sat in with blues harp player James Cotton there in 1968. Van Morrison, Tim Hardin, Tim Buckley, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Oscar Brown Jr., the Youngbloods, the Siegel-Schwall Band, John Hammond Jr., The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Michael Bloomfield, Jefferson Airplane, Cream, The Chambers Brothers, Canned Heat, The Fugs, Odetta, Country Joe and the Fish, The Yardbirds, The Doors all played there. Blues legends Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House, Skip James, Bukka White, and Big Joe Williams performed at the club after being "rediscovered" in the '60s. Before many rock groups began performing there, the Au Go Go was an oasis for jazz (Bill Evans, Stan Getz), comedy (Lenny Bruce, George Carlin), and folk music.
Current use.
The Garrick Cinema and related Cafe Au Go Go buildings were demolished in the 1970s, and the location, at 152 Bleecker Street, was used for a mid-rise apartment building with a Capital One Bank branch at ground level, which are the current buildings (as of September 2017), according to Google Maps.

Ponerorchis graminifolia

Ponerorchis graminifolia is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to southern Korea and Japan. They are short herbaceous perennials, growing from a tuber, with small flowers in shades of pink to purple. Many varieties and cultivars are grown in Japan as ornamental plants. The Japanese name for the species is transcribed as "uchou-ran" or "utyouran".
Description.
"Ponerorchis graminifolia" is a short herbaceous perennial growing from an ovoid tuber. It reaches a height of 10–15 cm (less often 25 cm). It has two to four linear leaves, 7–15 cm long. The inflorescence is a raceme containing 2–15 flowers. Each flower is about 15 mm across, pink to purplish overall. The upper sepal and the lateral petals form a "helmet". The lip or labellum is about 13 mm long, deeply divided into three broad lobes. A spur is present, 10–15 mm long, shorter than the ovary.
Several varieties have been described, some of which vary in flower colour. "P. graminifolia" var. "kurokamiana" has reddish purple flowers; 
"P. graminifolia" var. "nigropunctata" has paler flowers with darker spots or spotted lines.
Taxonomy.
"Ponerorchis graminifolia" was first described in 1852, by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach; it is the type species of the genus "Ponerorchis". The genus name is derived from the Greek πονηρός, meaning "wretched", "worthless", "useless". The specific epithet "graminifolia" means "grass-leaved".
, four varieties have been recognized:
Distribution and habitat.
"Ponerorchis graminifolia" is native to south Korea and south-central and south Japan (Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu). It grows in mountainous areas, particularly among damp rocks.
Cultivation.
"Ponerorchis graminifolia" is cultivated as an ornamental plant, particularly in Japan, where many cultivars of "uchou-ran" have been described with widely differing flower colours and markings, from pure white to darkish purple, with or without spots and markings. In Britain, they can be grown in pots in a gritty compost. Without forcing, they then come into growth in early spring, flower in late spring and early summer, dying down before the autumn, after which they are kept dry and frost-free over winter. Propagation is via tuber division or seed.
Hybrids with "Ponerorchis chidorii" and "Ponerorchis gracilis" ("Amitostigma gracile") have been reported to be in cultivation.

Mlikh

Mlikh () is a mountain village in the Jezzine district, located in the South Governorate in Southern Lebanon. It lies on the Al Rihan mountain chain (around 4,000-7,000 feet above sea level, Mlikh is located at around 1,280 meters and higher at other peaks above sea level). The village is located on a number of mountains peaks, and between the mountain peaks.
History.
In 1838, Eli Smith noted "Melikh " as a village by Jezzin, "East of et-Tuffa".
Etymology.
The word Mlikh may derive from the Semitic (Aramaic) word for "king". The root of Mlikh or king in the Semitic language is mlk. The word malik derives from the Semitic root mlk. Mlikh or mlk may also possibly be connected to Moloch since moloch derives from the same mlk root, and means "to rule". In Phoenician (where it is theorized "mlk" derives from) mlk has been linked to "king", possibly deriving from pagan Melqart. 
Demographics.
The natives of Mlikh are Shia and Maronite-Christians. The village houses one church, one mosque, and a Hussainiya. 
Historical significance.
The village is home to a number of ancient "prophets" whose tombs are located on the mountain peaks surrounding Mlikh, including Burkab, and Sujud (believed by some scholars to be Oholiab, however his existence or this connection cannot be fully verified). Shia and Christian inhabitants of the village and of the southern Lebanese region make pilgrimages to the tombs.
Notable people.
Amal Abou Zeid (born 5 June 1953) is a member of the Lebanese parliament, and is from Mlikh. He is a member of the National Commission for Economy, Trade, Industry and Planning in the Lebanese Parliament, since December 2016.

History of children in the military

Children in the military are children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as persons under the age of 18) who are associated with military organizations, such as state armed forces and non-state armed groups. Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been involved in military campaigns. For example, thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War. Children may be trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, or used for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda.
Children are easy targets for military recruitment due to their greater susceptibility to influence compared to adults. Some children are recruited by force while others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity.
Pre-20th century.
Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.
The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek mythology (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature. In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.
The Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age. Despite this, several Roman legionaries were known to have enlisted children aged 14 in the Imperial Roman army, such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.
In medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides ("squires"), though in theory, their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called Children's Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.
Young boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17. Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as "The Infants of the Emperor". These soldiers were in their mid-teens. One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous "drummer boy".
During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the ship's magazine to the gun crews. These children were called "powder monkeys."
During the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history. Several other minors, including 11-year-old Willie Johnston, have also received the Medal of Honor.
By a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the cantonists, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. 
In the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay.
During the Boshin War, the pro-"shōgun" Aizu Domain formed the , which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu, they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed "seppuku" while one was unsuccessful. He was saved by a local peasant.
World War I.
The youngest known soldier of World War I was Momčilo Gavrić, who joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army at the age of 8, after Austro-Hungarian troops in August 1914 killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings.
In the West, boys as young as 12 were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a Bantam battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was Claude Choules, who enlisted in the Royal Navy at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15. In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as "Çanakkale", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the "15'liler" or "The 15s" company, with no known survivors.
Spanish Civil War.
Many child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:
World War II.
In World War II children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.
After World War II: Historical examples by region.
These are historical examples. For instances of children in the military today, see Children in the military.
Africa.
Algeria.
During the Algerian civil war (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by Islamist armed groups fighting the government. A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports. Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by conscription) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up. The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.
Burundi.
Children were kidnapped and used extensively during the civil war of 1993–2005. In 2004 hundreds of child soldiers were in the Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL), an armed rebel, Hutu group. Children between the ages of 10 and 16 were also conscripted by the Burundese military.
After the Arusha peace accord of 2001 and the Pretoria agreement of 2003 eventually brought the conflict to an end in 2005, the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat. The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord.
By 2006, a reintegration program organized by UNICEF had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups. According to Child Soldiers International:The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training. Health care was provided for those with special needs and psychosocial support was provided through individual and group meetings., Burundi no longer appears on the UN list of countries where children are used in hostilities.
Chad.
Between 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict. They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the United Front for Democratic Change ("Front Uni pour le Changement", FUC), local self-defense forces known as "Tora Boro" militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA). After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.
Côte d'Ivoire.
During Côte d'Ivoire's civil war of 2002–2004, "children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides", and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003. The "Patriotic Youth –" armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government. Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living, although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging. They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.
Attempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained. After President Laurent Gbagbo refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased. Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.
Eritrea.
During its 30-year war for independence with Ethiopia (1961–1991) the Eritrean People's Liberation Front was "widely acknowledged" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International). Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the two-year border war with Ethiopia in 1998. There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15), but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.
The UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces, and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11th grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.
Ethiopia.
According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 2001 there were "credible reports" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its two-year border war with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the front lines and in massive waves across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places. The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large prisoner of war camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.
The main opposition group in the 1990s, the Oromo Liberation Front, also systematically recruited children, including by force.
In 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia, and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.
Liberia.
In Liberia's civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery. It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given valium before a battle, known as "bubbles" or "10-10". Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use. Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.
United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed. A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment. By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities. However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs.
By 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children. , children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.
The use of child soldiers in Liberia was epitomised by The Small Boys Unit, established by Liberian President Charles Taylor. The boys were not provided with sustenance, but were expected to engage in "snake patrol", looting surrounding villages. Taylor and others were later tried before the Special Court for Sierra Leone because of his involvement in recruiting child soldiers.
Rwanda.
An estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 Rwanda genocide when many children were involved in committing atrocities. 5,000 children were in the national army, while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups. After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age. In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Initial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups. In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers. The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children. Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.
Sierra Leone.
During the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and the pro-government Civil Defence Forces (CDF).
Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups. By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.
After 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.
In June 2007 the Special Court for Sierra Leone found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children.
, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Sierra Leone, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.
In his book "A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Child Soldier", Ishmael Beah chronicles his life during the conflict in Sierra Leone. In "Armies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism" anthropologist David M. Rosen discusses the murders, rapes, tortures, and thousands of amputations committed by the RUF Small Boys Unit. The film "Blood Diamond" is set during the civil war. The issue is also explored in the "Bones" episode, "The Survivor In The Soap".
Uganda.
Over a period of twenty years the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted more than 30,000 boys and girls as soldiers or sex slaves. Joseph Kony began the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1987, originally to protect northern Ugandans from the 1986 military coup by the People's National Resistance Army. Stating that he "received messages from God" Kony began attacking his own people, the Acholi, to establish a new theocratic government in Uganda based on the principles of the "Ten Commandments of God". This attempt by the LRA to gain control of the Ugandan government via roaming armies used boy- as well as girl-children as soldiers, such as Grace Akallo.
The LRA expansion into South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo has used large numbers of children as active combatants and participants in extreme violence. On the 21October 2008 an appeal by the UN Security Council was made asking for the LRA to cease all military action in the DRC immediately. On 14June 2002 Uganda deposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute, and on 16December 2003 the Government of Uganda referred the situation concerning northern Uganda to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC investigated the situation and on 14October 2005 issued indictments against Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and four other commanders for war crimes: Vincent Otti; Raska Lukwiya (indictment terminated, deceased); Okot Odhiambo; and Dominic Ongwen. The warrant for Kony, Otti and Odhiambo includes the alleged crime of the forced enlisting of children contrary to the Rome Statute Art. 8(2) (e)(vii).
The National Resistance Army also made use of child soldiers. Between 2003 and 2007, non-state armed groups fighting the LRA also used children.
In 2007 the Ugandan government agreed an action plan with the UN to end the use of child soldiers and in 2008 the country no longer appeared on the UN list of countries that recruit and use children.
Libya.
Reports from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that as of September 2020, Turkey have sent to Libya 18,000 Syrian mercenaries, including 350 children, for the Second Libyan Civil War.
Report from the "Syrians for Truth and Justice" organisation also showed that children included at the Syrian mercenaries that Turkey sent to Libya.
In addition, report from the Al-Monitor citing sources in Libya also stated that Syrian children were being sent to Libya to fight alongside with the Turkish-backed forces.
Americas.
El Salvador.
During the civil war between 1980 and 1992 the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the "Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National" (FMLN)"," recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions. A fifth of the army's personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN. In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years. The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education. Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause.
After the civil war came to a close, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them. A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma.
Today, the Salvadoran military no longer sends children to war, but it still recruits and trains them from the age of 16.
Middle East.
Iran.
During the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) the armed forces used children widely; the extent of the practice is not known but the number of children involved is thought to be in the tens of thousands. Armed groups associated with the government advertised widely for children from age 14 to join them, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, urged children to fight at the front. According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International):Ayatollah Khomeini declared that parental permission was unnecessary for those going to the front, that volunteering for military duty was a religious obligation, and that serving in the armed forces took priority over all other forms of work or study. Various sources reported that children were indoctrinated into participating in combat. They were given "keys to paradise" and promised that they would go directly to heaven if they died as martyrs against the Iraqi enemy.The children involved were overwhelmingly from slums and poor villages, and some participated without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Thousands of children took part in human wave attacks, leading to widespread deaths and injuries. The total number of all Iranian casualties is estimated to be 200,000–600,000, of which approximately a third were aged 15–19 (and 3 percent under 14), according to one assessment.
After the war, the "Basij," an official militia organisation, continued to recruit children from age 15, focusing on those living in poverty and sometimes recruiting them by force. In 2004, the "Basij" was estimated to have as many as a million members of all ages. "Ansar-e Hizbollah", an armed group tolerated by the government, also recruited children widely in the 2000s, with no age restriction. , the Iranian armed forces continue to enlist from age 16 and the government has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.
Iraq.
The government of Saddam Hussein maintained 'boot camps' of civilian youths between the ages of 12 and 17 that involved small arms training and Ba'athist political indoctrination. Iraqi opposition sources and the US State Department reported that children who refused faced punishment. The state incorporated children as young as ten into the "Futuwah" and "Ashbal Saddam" youth movements and then subjected them to military training, sometimes for 14 hours a day. P. W. Singer has compared the groups to the "Hitler Jugend". In the Gulf War 12-year-old boys fought for the Iraqis. Children also participated in the Iran–Iraq War.
In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US forces fought children at Nasariya, Karbala, and Kirkuk, and the US sent captured child combatants to Abu Ghraib prison. In 2009 a UN report on the post-war Iraqi occupation stated that the Iraqi insurgency had used children as combatants; it noted, for example, a suicide attack against Kirkuk's police commander by a boy aged between 10 and 13.
Asia.
Cambodia.
In the 1970s the "Khmer Rouge" exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the Cambodian civil war and subsequent genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation. After it was deposed in 1979, the "Khmer Rouge" fought a guerrilla war against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction. During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.
Cambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants. Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the "Cambodia Daily". Many children had fled the "Khmer Rouge" without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay. Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist. Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.
By 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only. Meanwhile, the "Khmer Rouge" had collapsed with the death of its leader, Pol Pot, in 1998. By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the demobilisation programmes were inadequate, according to UNICEF, failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.
Sri Lanka.
Between 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka's government fought a civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10. Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda. Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy. In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them. Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the "Baby Battalion", due to the number of children in it. Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the Karuna group, a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force. The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media.
The first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks. The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007. The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year.
Europe.
Chechnya/Russia.
During the First Chechen War, Chechen separatist forces included a large number of boys and girls, some as young as 11. According to the UN: "Child soldiers in Chechnya were reportedly assigned the same tasks as adult combatants, and served on the front lines soon after joining the armed forces." In 2004 under-18s were still believed to be involved in a range of armed groups in the war against Russia; some allegedly took part in suicide bombings.
United Kingdom.
In the 20th century, the Royal Navy commonly recruited boy seamen aged from 15 up for active service; boys aged 13 or 14 were recruited for other duties.
Children aged 17 were sent to the Falklands War in 1982 (where three were killed) and the Gulf War in 1990–91 (where two were killed). 17-year-olds were also deployed as NATO peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Having initially resisted international negotiations to prevent the deployment of children, the UK agreed to deploy adults only when it signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2000, but remained committed to recruiting and training children from age 16. Between 2003 and 2010, 22 personnel aged 17 were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, reportedly in error.
During the Troubles in Northern Ireland (c. 1960s to 1998) it was common for paramilitary groups to recruit and use children, including as combatants. Five children in Republican paramilitary groups, seven in Loyalist paramilitary groups, and five in the British armed forces, died during the conflict. The youngest, Cathleen McCartland, was recruited by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and was aged 12 when she was killed in Belfast.

Emmanuel Arène

Emmanuel Arène (1 January 1856 – 14 August 1908) was a French journalist, playwright and republican politician who was deputy for Corsica for many years and senator of Corsica in his last years. He was involved in scandals over maritime mail contracts and the Panama Canal funding. Towards the end of his career he dominated Corsican politics. Arène was also a prolific and successful journalist, wrote short stories and wrote for the theatre.
Background.
After the fall of the Emperor Napoleon III in 1870 the island of Corsica was a Bonapartist stronghold for the next ten years.
New political players from the middle-classes appeared from 1880 onward, mostly foreign to the idea of dynasties.
Instead they based their legitimacy on their education, professional success and ability to get things done by pulling together political, administrative and business networks.
Arène emerged as one of the most prominent of these new men, leader of the island's Republicans by 1885 and the dominant political power in Corsica at the time of his death in 1908.
Early years.
Emmanuel Arène was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, on 1 January 1856.
He was the fifth of six children of Joseph Arène, a merchant, and Jeanne-Paule Forcioli, a shopkeeper.
His grandfather, Louis Arène, was an innkeeper from Solliès-Pont, Var, who had settled in Ajaccio in 1757 and prospered.
The family had soon integrated into the local community through marriages with the Campi and Forcioli families of the old Ajaccian bourgeoisie.
Emmanuel's father was a prosperous merchant who achieved considerable social prominence.
His funeral was attended by the consuls of England, Italy and Denmark and several high officials of the Corsican administration.
Despite growing up in a conventionally Bonapartist milieu, Arène showed Republican sympathies as a young man.
After completing his secondary education he enrolled at the University of Aix-en-Provence, but failed after his first year.
He then went to Paris, determined to study more seriously than in Aix.
His goal was to qualify as a lawyer.
He became a habitual reader of the "Le XIXe siècle", a journal directed by Edmond About, a Republican journalist and writer, and anti-clerical Freemason who was close to Léon Gambetta.
In September 1875 a letter by Arène was published in the paper responding to an article on the intolerance of Corsicans by Francisque Sarcey.
About met Arène, was impressed by his spirit, political convictions and writing ability, and gave him a job as a correspondent for "Le XIXe siècle".
Arène left the university and joined the circle of the Parisian Opportunist Republicans.
After leaving "Le XIXe Siècle" he moved on to the journal "Paris", which had been founded by former editors of "La France".
In several lively controversies Arène was a strong supporter of Gambetta.
In 1879 he accepted the position of chief of the special secretariat of the Minister of the Interior and Religion, Charles Lepère(), and continued with Lepère's successor Ernest Constans until November 1881.
Gambetta supported Arène's election to the general council of Corsica in August 1880, despite the fact that technically he was ineligible since he was not yet 25 years old.
He defeated the deputy and incumbent Charles Abbatucci.
Since he was under 25, the election was annulled, but in March 1881 he was again elected against Abbatucci.
Arène was General Councilor continuously from 1880 until 1908, first in the canton of Zicavo (1881–1886), then San-Lorenzo (1888–1903) and finally Santa-Maria-Siché (1903–1908). 
He was president of the Departmental Assembly from 1888 to 1893, in 1896, and then from 1900 to 1908.
Deputy.
3rd legislature (1881–85).
Gambetta supported Arène in his election as deputy for the district of Corte on 4 December 1881 in a by-election after Horace de Choiseul-Praslin() had chosen to represent Melun in Seine-et-Marne.
Arène won with 6,672 votes out of 9,389 against the radical republican Paschal Grousset, a former member of the Paris Commune.
Arène sat with the Republican Union group and voted for the opportunist policy of the governments of Gambetta and Jules Ferry.
He supported the "grand ministry" in his articles in the press.
On 26 January 1882 he was with the Gambetta minority, and was very cool to the cabinet of Charles de Freycinet.
He voted against the Jules Roche amendment on election of the mayor of Paris, against the proposal of Charles Boysset() to abolish the Concordat of 1801 and against elections of magistrates by the people.
He spoke in the chamber on 12 July 1882 as rapporteur on the project for maritime postal services between continental France and Corsica.
Arène was a strong supporter of Jules Ferry, who became prime minister on 22 February 1883 and backed him over the Tonkin expedition although he abstained from voting to fund it.
He voted for maintaining the embassy in the Holy See, for suppression of life senators and for the proposal by Jean Antoine Ernest Constans to reinstate voting for lists.
As a contributor to "Le Matin", in August 1884 Arène had a violent dispute with the deputy Félix Granet() and Ernest Judet, director and editor in chief of the "Presse Libre".
Previously Judet had accused Arène and his friend, the senator Nicolas Péraldi, of being biased in favour of François Morelli's shipping company, which had the concession for maritime postal services between the continent and Corsica.
Arène accused Judet of "indelicacy or theft" when an issue of the "Presse Libre" reproduced a dispatch from Bastia to Arène.
They fought a duel in which Arène was wounded in the hand.
Arène was a friend of the prefect André de Trémontels, and was involved in the affair of the journalist Saint-Elme, whose death was attributed to Trémontels.
4th legislature (1886–89).
Arène ran for reelection as republican candidate for Deputy of Corsica, but won only 24,625 votes against 24,953 for the last elected member on the conservative list, François de Montera().
The election was invalidated, and in a rerun on 14 February 1886 Arène was elected with 25,948 votes out of 49,382.
In the new legislature he registered with the Union of the Left and continued to support moderate republicans and.
He voted for the Rouvier and Tirard ministries in the sessions of 19 November 1887 and 30 March 1888.
Arène was made president of the general council of Corsica in 1888.
He used his position in the power structure to give out public and private jobs, exemptions, favors and credits, mostly to his family and his allies.
On 11 February 1889 he voted in favour of reinstatement of the universal ballot.
On 14 February 1889 he abstained from the vote to adjourn revision of the constitutional laws.
He was appointed rapporteur of the commission to consider prosecution of the three deputies who belonged to the Ligue des Patriotes, and was unusually vocal in this role.
On 4 April 1889 he voted in favour of prosecution of General Boulanger.
5th and 6th legislature (1889–98).
In the general elections of 22 September 1889 Arène was reelected deputy of Sartène (Corsica) in the first round by 4,090 votes against 2,965 for the Bonapartist candidate Abbatucci.
He registered with the Republican group.
In this legislature he was active in the debates over the budget of the ministries of Agriculture and the Interior.
He asked for a phased increase of the tax for Corsica and for completion of the railway line from Vizzavona to Corte.
He was named in the Panama Affair, but was reelected in the first round in the 20 August 1893 general elections.
He was finally acquitted from the Panama scandal in 1893.
In his electoral campaign in 1893 he proclaimed,
Arène married Laure Orenga on 20 August 1894 in Bastia, daughter of Étienne-Louis Orenga, a trader, president of the commercial court and vice-president of the chamber of commerce.
He began to write for "Le Figaro" in 1895.
In 1896 the newspaper "La France" published a list of 104 parliamentarians including Arène who had allegedly received funds from the Panama company.
To confirm his mandate Arène chose to run as deputy for Ajaccio in the 7 November 1897 by-election caused by the death of Dominique François Ceccaldi(), and was returned by 8,941 votes to 1,008 for his opponent.
The Chamber did not rule on the validity of this election, but his position as deputy was now unassailable.
During the Dreyfus affair, on 12 November 1897 Arène agreed with Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, Mathieu Dreyfus, Louis Leblois() and Edgar Demange to launch a campaign to sway public opinion in favour of a revision of the verdict against Dreyfus.
Arène wrote an article in "Le Figaro" on 14 November 1897 under the pseudonym "Vidi" on "Le dossier de M. Scheurer-Kestner".
It revealed that Alfred Dreyfus had not written the "bordereau", which could not be attributed to him.
The real traitor, who was not named, was described as "an officer, who is quite well-known in Paris ... married ... well-connected ... not attached to the Ministry of War but to a garrison near Paris".
The article also stated that a "new document", the "faux Henry", that cited the name of Dreyfus and had been mentioned by General Jean-Baptiste Billot to Scheurer-Kestner, was a forgery.
7th and 8th legislatures (1898–1904).
In the 8 May 1898 general elections Arène was reelected deputy of Ajaccio by 8,437 votes against 2,464 for his main opponent.
In the early spring of 1899 the young Corsican Joseph Marie François Spoturno, whose family knew Arène's mother Jeanne Forcioli, arrived in Paris where Arène gave him a job as an unpaid assistant. 
Arène introduced Spoturno, later better known as François Coty, to politicians and officials, and to his wide circle of acquaintances in Parisian society.
On one occasion Arène challenged the journalist Arthur Meyer to a duel for saying the deputies from Corsica were bandits.
Spoturno accompanied Arène to the dawn rendezvous in the Bois de Boulogne, where both men fired and missed, satisfying honour.
Spoturno became interested in selling perfume.
Arène encouraged him in this venture, and advised him to conceal his Corsican origins by taking his mother's name Coti and spelling it as Coty.
This was the origin of the beauty products company Coty, Inc..
In the general elections of 27 April 1902 Arène was reelected by 10,084 against 606 for his main opponent.
In his last two legislatures he devoted himself to defending the economic interests of Corsica, where he dominated politics.
On 4 January 1903 he orchestrated the election of Émile Combes as senator despite his unpopular positions on religion and the Dreyfus affair.
When Combes chose instead to represent Charente-Inferieure, where he had also been elected, Arène supported Arthur Ranc, who was elected to the senate on 15 February 1903.
Last years.
After Senator Ange Muracciole died on 2 July 1904, Arène ran in the resulting by-election on 18 September 1904 and was elected to the senate by 767 votes out of 784.
He held office until his death.
Emmanuel Arène died in Le Fayet, Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, Haute-Savoie, on 14 August 1908 at the age of 52.
His only son Jean-Louis was 12 years old when he died, and did not follow him into politics.
Publications.
Arène was a journalist throughout his political career, and his many articles were extremely popular, particularly those written for "Le Matin".
He also wrote for "Le XIXe siècle", "Le Voltaire", "Le Paris", "Le Gil Blas", "L’Éclair", "Le Figaro", "L’Union républicaine", "La Corse républicaine" and "Le Journal de la Corse".
He had a brilliant style, tinged with irony and sometimes gently malicious.
Until his death he wrote the dramatic column of "Le Figaro" with an indulgent and facetious style.
He published a collection of short stories in 1887, "Le dernier bandit".
Arene became well known as an author for "L'Adversaire", co-authored with Alfred Capus.
He later collaborated with Robert de Flers and Gaston Arman de Caillavet on "Le Roi" (The King).
Various speeches, proposals and reports by Arène were published by the National Assembly. 
Other publications by Arène include:

Minnie White (musician)

Minnie White (1916 – 2002) was a traditional Newfoundland musician who became known as the "First Lady of the Accordion" in the 1960s and 70s.
White was born Mary Agnes Hoskins, in St. Alban’s, Bay d'Espoir, on the southeast coast of what was then the Dominion of Newfoundland. She was introduced to music by her father, Samuel Hoskins, who played mouth organ, fiddle and accordion. White could play the accordion by the time she was 8 years old, and at 16, when her family moved to the Codroy Valley, she played piano to accompany fiddlers at community dances.
In 1937, she married Richard White and they settled in the community of Tompkins. After starting a family, White gave up regular performing for many years. She played piano and organ, but it wasn’t until the 1960s that she returned to the accordion. In addition to playing the tunes she’d learned as a child, she began to compose her own songs, and for 13 years played a regular Sunday afternoon gig at the Starlite Lounge in Tompkins. White composed and arranged music, hired backing bands, and performed on accordion and mandolin.
In 1973 Minnie White recorded her first album, "Newfoundland’s First Lady of the Accordion". She toured Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and made television appearances on shows such as "The Root Cellar" and "Canadian Express", becoming part of the Newfoundland traditional music revival of the 1960s and 1970s. She recorded four albums, including "Newfoundland Accordion &amp; Mandolin Favourites" (1974), "Homestead Reels" (1978) and "The Hills of Home" (1994).
White was awarded the Order of Canada in 1993. In 1994 she was inducted into the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council Hall of Honour, and in 1995 nominated for Instrumental Artist of the Year at the East Coast Music Awards. During the summer of 1998 the community of Upper Ferry declared "Minnie White Day" in her honour.
White continued performing at festivals and special events until her death in 2001.

Permanent (film)

Permanent is a 2017 American comedy film written and directed by Colette Burson and starring Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson.
Plot.
The film is set in the early 1980s in small town Virginia.
Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the "Farrah Fawcett" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for $60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of $75. Aurelie signs up herself and Lydia. Lydia initially does not want to participate. During the poetry contest she panics and recites the lyrics to "Feeling Good" instead of her assigned poem. Meanwhile, Aurelie is confronted by the popular girls. She uses her karate training to defeat the girls and returns to the contest to see that Lydia has been announced the winner. Lydia offers Aurelie the money to fix her hair, and Aurelie declines saying that she no longer cares.
Jim, who wears a hairpiece, has been told by his college counselor that he must take a swimming class in order to receive his scholarship. He returns to the pool several times but cannot bring himself to put his head underwater or be seen without his hairpiece. Jeanne fills unfulfilled by her new life. Jim is unresponsive to her sexual advances, again stating he does not want to ruin his hairpiece or take it off. Jeanne instead becomes emotionally involved with their neighbor Jerry, who volunteers to teach her to be an artist and to help with family counseling. He reveals his true intentions when he comments on her breasts. During a family counseling session, Jim affirms his love and commitment to Jeanne. The film ends with Jim, Jeanne, and Aurelie at the school pool. Jim climbs the high dive, tosses his hairpiece off, and dives into the pool.
Production.
The film was shot in Virginia.
Reception.
The film has a 38% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Michael Ordona of Common Sense Media awarded the film three stars out of five. Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com awarded the film two stars.

Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II

Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II (Odia: ଦ୍ୱିତୀୟ ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ ଗଜପତି ନାରାୟଣ ଦେଓ) was the king of Paralakhemundi estate in the southern part of today's Odisha and with an Eastern Ganga lineage from the year 1736 CE to 1771 CE. He had ascended to the throne at the age of eighteen and at a time when Odisha was torn apart due conflicts between external powers like the Mughals, Marathas, French and British for control of the territory. He made the last great attempts on his own to revive the lost glory of Odisha and its unique Hindu culture that revolved around the tradition of Jagannath worship. He had defied the authority of the Nizam of Hyderabad and maintained his own sovereignty. He was one of the first rulers who indulged in conflicts with the new European colonists in the eastern part of India. He was also effort bound till the end of his life in framing strategic diplomatic plans to free the ancient land of Odisha from external aggressors and revival of its lost Ganga-Gajapati glory from the past.
Political conditions of Paralakhemundi.
After the death of the last Suryavanshi emperor of Odisha Prataparudra Deva in 1540 A.D, most of the Gajapati Empire reduced to a small tiny strip of land in today’s coastal Odisha. The Golconda Qutb Shahi ruler – Quli Qutb Shah had engaged militarily with the last great Gajapati ruler and had managed to acquire southern parts of the Gajapati Empire. By the year 1630 A.D, the whole of Paralakhemundi fell into the hands of the Qutb Shahi rulers and then passed on to Nizam-Ul- Mulk’s control who himself was ruling in southern India as the Subedar or vassal of Mughals in the year 1713 A.D. In the year 1753 A.D, the Paralakhemundi estate passed on to the French along with three other adjoining estates in the Northern Circars when the Nizam gave it to the French under a treaty acknowledging their services rendered to him. The independent ruler of Paralakhemundi, Gajapati Jagannath Narayan Deo II defied the Treaty of Hyderabad and the French authority over his territory as his family had even denied the rule of the Nizam over their estate earlier and functioned as independent rulers.
Administration and the military.
The rulers of Paralakhemundi had an efficient way of delivering administration and collecting taxes from their subjects. The area of the heartland estate was 639 square kilometers. The whole estate and the total territory under the control of the rulers were, divided in eleven divisions that were, ruled by the eleven representative Bisoyis of the king. The administrative territory included seven divisions of hilly and mountainous terrain while the rest four comprised the plain areas. The Bisoyis were also in the command of Paika militia units with the help of which they defended their divisions from any external threats. There were further seventeen subdivisions and were controlled by the small militia leaders called the Doras who were selected by the King personally. The Doras collected taxes from the Gumang chiefs of the Savara tribal communities residing in different villages. After Narayana Deo II ascended the throne in the year 1736 CE, he had openly defied any control by the Nizam and joined hands with other local rulers and landlords of Ganjam and Srikakulam taluk opposing the control by Golconda rulers. As his predecessors, he defied paying revenue taxes to the Nizams. The Nizam in return was also militarily incapable of controlling the further rebellious northern divisions of the Northern Circars.
Military engagements.
Jagannatha Narayana Deo II envisioned to pull the ancient land of Odisha and its great Hindu culture out of the greedy clutches of external powers. He sent secret messages to different local rulers for uniting against the enemies, freeing Odisha and reviving the ancient glory of Odisha as a military power in the subcontinent. However, he failed in his effort to persuade his fellow ruling kings to unite for this cause as most of them were either the vassals of Marathas or powerless to challenge the presence of great military powers contesting with each other for complete authority. Enraged by the ineffectiveness of the ruler of Khurda and head administrator of the Jagannath temple at Puri, Virakishore Deva he invaded his kingdom in 1760 A.D.
First battles of Jelmur with Sitaram Raju, the French regent.
Prior to this invasion of Khurda the French, who were in control of Ganjam district had appointed the Telugu king of Vizianagaram Sitaram Raju as their regent of their Odia territories. As per the treaty of Hyderabad, Paralakhemundi was submitted to the French by the Nizam in 1753 A.D but Narayan Deo II had defied them like the Nizam. To gain control of the estate, Sitaram Raju continuously invaded Paralakhemundi on behalf of the French. According to the records, the forces of Paralakhemundi and Sitaram Raju had clashed at least twice near Jelmur situated thirty kilometers from Paralakhemundi town, resulting in the defeat of the forces of the French regent but also losing some parts of the estate in the meanwhile.
Invasion of Khurda and Battles of Chatragarh Fort.
In the year 1760 A.D, Narayan Deva II invaded the coastal districts of Odisha to defeat the incompetent Bhoi dynasty vassal ruler of the Marathas Virakishore Deva, take control of the Jagannath temple and push the Marathas out of Barabati Fort. He first attacked the fort of Chatragarh in the district of Puri that was controlled by the Khurda forces and laid a seize to it. The king of Khurda was defeated and escaped to Cuttack that was controlled by the Marathas seeking their intervention.
The Marathas agreed to support their vassal Bhoi king at the condition of more revenue from the Khurda territory that included Puri and Nayagarh districts of today. The combined army of the Marathas and the Khurda king attacked the Paralakhemundi forces at the fort of Chatragarh. Unable to hold a much larger and well supplied Maratha army, Narayana Deo II decided to retreat to his estate. The Khurda king, Virkishore Deva however was unable to pay the promised additional revenues for this support provided by the Marathas and had to surrender his authority over Limbai, Rehang and Puri to them.
Second Battle of Jelmur with Sitaram Raju.
In the year 1761 A.D during the absence of Narayana Deo II from his estate for his expedition on Khurda, the king of Vizianagaram Sitaram Raju had invaded Paralakhemundi with his brother Vijayaram Raju. A battle ensued at the fort of Jelmur where Sitaram Raju again lost to the Paralakhemundi forces who had returned fresh from battle with Khurda.
Second Treaty of Hyderabad and beginning of Paralakhemundi affairs.
In year 1759 A.D the French retreated from the Northern Circars as the British forces were threatening Madras. The French governor of Pondicherry, Monsieur Lally had summoned the French troops to fight against the British attack at Madras. Taking the advantage of the French retreat, the people of Paralakhemundi revolted against their regents like Sitaram Raju. After the French were pursued out of Hyderabad, on twelfth of November 1766 the Nizam of Hyderabad Nizam Ali Khan concluded another treaty with the British East India Company in which he surrendered the northern territories to them. The East India Company sent an officer by the name Mr. Cotsford to assess the situation of these territories the next year. On his tour to the regions of Visakhapatnam and Ganjam, Cotsford not only reported the excesses and atrocities carried out by the former French regent Sitaram Raju but also reported about Paralakhemundi as follows:
The defiance and series of uprisings by Narayana Deo II is stated as the first phase of Paralakhemundi Affairs and was considered as important matter as the connection between Madras and Calcutta was threatened by the events taking place in Paralakhemundi.
Third Battle of Jelmur with the British.
Based on the report presented by Mr. Cotsford, the British dispatched a force under the leadership of Colonel Peach to suppress the defiant king of Paralakhemundi. On the fourth of April 1768 A.D, the forces of Narayana Deo II and the British clashed at Jelmur. Unable to contain the superior British forces, Narayana Deo II lost the battle and hid himself in the Malliah hilly terrains of his estate. After the East India Company came victorious in the region they appointed Ramyogi Patra as the Diwan or the administrator of the estate to collect revenues. The Bisoyis, Doras, Savara tribals and other common people continued to stay loyal and only paid the taxes declaring Narayana Deo II as the legal ruler. The British captured Pratapgiri, Alladigam and Siddheswaram forts on seventeenth of April 1768 A.D. The British later sent Captain Bendinell in 1771 A.D with a contingent to subdue Bhim Deo, the local ruler of Bada Khemundi as he had sided with Narayana Deo II in his activities against the British and had been his trustworthy ally since the times of the Khurda expedition.
Continuation of defiance to the British.
After the British left the area towards Visakhapatnam on twelfth of December 1768, Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II again reappeared from his hiding, ousted the British Diwan Ramyogi Patra with the support of his people and even tried in secrecy to forge an agreement with the Marathas for fighting the colonists. The local rulers of Athagarh and Khalikote sided by him in his effort and actively provided him assistance. When the Marathas conveyed that they would not intervene in the matter of the British East India Company in Paralekhemundi, he attempted repeatedly to establish a connection with the French so that an agreement for assistance against the British could be made. However, Narayan Deo II died on 5 December 1771 without being able to execute his plans.
Personality and historical impact.
Paralakhemundi rulers had been great patrons of Odia culture and literature. The ruling Gajapati Narayana Deo II was a highly self-educated and spiritual person himself, had authored the Odia work called "Sri Brundabana Bihara" after he had returned from a spiritual tour of the Vrindavan and a Sanskrit treatise on Odissi classical music called "Sangita Narayana". Paralakhemundi royal court found itself as a place where many renounced scholars of the time like Baladev Ratha were encouraged, rewarded and affiliated by the rulers for their contribution to art, culture and literature. Narayan Deo II was an adherent to the preachings of Sri Chaitanya and was a devoted Vaishnavite.
Although the efforts put together by Jagannatha Gajapati Narayana Deo II for the revival of Odisha into its past glory despite multiple external aggressors failed, his activities inspired the next series of revolts against the British by his son and step brother in 1799 A.D also known as the second phase of Pralakhemundi Affairs. There were successive revolts by the local people and the indigenous Savara tribals between the years 1813 A.D-1834 A.D and again in 1851 A.D-1856 A.D that was led by Radhakrishna Dandasena. The seventh in line descendant of Narayana Deo II, Krushna Chandra Gajapati Narayana Dev played a pivotal role in the formation of the state of Odisha in the year 1936, dedicated his life for the cause of Odia language and became the first prime minister of Odisha during the British rule.

Sister-books

Sister-books () is the term for a group of texts in the medieval literature. These works were written by Dominican nuns in the first half of the fourteenth century in South Germany and Switzerland. They relate the mystical experiences of sisters within the monastery, and were influential in the development of medieval mysticism.
Content.
Some of the sister-books begin with brief, mostly legendary, outlines of the founding history of the monastery, but less attention is paid to the historical facts than to the sentiments and heroic actions of founders. The central content of the books consists of reports on the lives of deceased members of the convent. The sister-books depict not only convent sisters, but also lay nuns and sometimes also men associated with the convent. The presentation usually concentrates on those events in which the subject has acted in an exemplary manner, especially through visions or mystical experiences. Occasionally, the reverse is also shown, when a person's failure or the loss of graces is reported. Essential aspects of the monastic as well as the individual religious life come up, along with current theological problems from questions of monastic obedience to the doctrine of grace and the Trinity dogma. Other themes include co-suffering with Christ and the question of the soul.
Literary form.
The sister-books are a type of medieval lives literature, in which each work relates the lives of a number of people. These descriptions focus on the person's relationship to God and their behavior in the monastic community. This genre of writing was similar to the Vitae Fratrum of male Dominican orders, which in turn was heavily influenced by the Vitae Patrum, a collection of sayings from early Christian monks. The sister-books are also characterized by both the forms and structures of legendary narrative and the vocabulary and motifs of mysticism; the texts take images and metaphors quite seriously. In addition, note that all but one of the sister-books were written in the German vernacular, while the Unterlinden sister-book was written in Latin. None of the original manuscripts of the sister-books survive to this day; scholars rely on later copies, some of which were done as early as the fifteenth century.
Significance.
While the sister-books were often devalued as products of naive nuns and as an expression of a flattened mysticism in earlier scholarship, today they find new attention as authentic testimonies of a women's monastic writing culture. Since only men were permitted to write theological treatises, highly educated women turned to narrative forms, especially in the form of vision narratives, to explain or discuss concepts of religious thought and action.
At the same time, these books are important documents for the history of German mysticism. They show that mysticism in women's monasteries was not just a consequence of Dominican preaching; rather, it preceded it in some monasteries. In the discourse on women's religious experiences, Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, Heinrich Seuse and others developed their mystical theology and pastoral care.

New Central Polish Airport

The Solidarity Transport Hub or Central Communication/Transport Port (, "CPK") is a megaproject of the Government of Poland aimed at the construction of a new, built-from-scratch airport to be located approximately southwest of Warsaw, which is planned to replace Warsaw Chopin Airport, which is slowly starting to get surrounded by urban areas. The English name "Solidarity Transport Hub Poland" is proposed for the project by its website. 
The planned launch of the port is 2027. At first the airport is to have two runways, but ultimately four. The combined airport and train station will plan to serve 40 million passengers per year - around the scale of Berlin Brandenburg Airport - and ultimately around 100 million passengers. Planned train connections will take 15 minutes to Warsaw Central railway station, 25 minutes to Łódź Fabryczna railway station, and 2 hours to most other major Polish cities, such as Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań and Gdańsk.
Location.
The airport's planned site is about 40km west of Warsaw, next to the village Stanisławów which is part of Gmina Baranów in Grodzisk Mazowiecki County. The Baranow commune occupies a significant part of the Grodzisk County and, despite its rural character, has an extensive road infrastructure. The A2 autostrada and railway lines run in the immediate vicinity of the potential construction site, and Wrocław (Expressway S8) and Poznań (national road No. 92) is nearby.
The choice of the location was made after a number of areas were examined. Before recommending Baranów, the Arup consulting company analyzed a list of potential locations, including: Modlin, Wołomin, Sochaczew, Mszczonów, Babsk, Nowe Miasto nad Pilicą, Grójec and Radom-Sadków. Experts took into account the distance from Warsaw, transport accessibility, land accessibility and environmental restrictions, including noise levels. Analyses showed that Baranów offers an optimal location for the project.
History.
Discussion about a new airport to replace Warsaw Chopin Airport began in the 2000s. On May 12, 2005, the Civil Aviation Office signed a contract with the Spanish consortium Ineco-Sener to carry out a feasibility study of the central airport. Such a study was nevertheless not actually carried out during the next two years, which was interpreted as a sign that the project of a new big central airport was being postponed until an indeterminate future. Nevertheless, a new airport serving Warsaw was proposed in the government's Transport Infrastructure Development Strategy for 2010-2013. 
After the Law and Justice party regained power in Poland the project gained pace, with the government approving the plan on November 2017.
On June 17, 2018, the residents of the district of Baranów, Grodzisk Mazowiecki County voted down the plan to build the new airport. With 47 percent voter turnout, 84 percent opposed the plan. The referendum was not binding, but Deputy Infrastructure Minister Mikołaj Wild said that the voice of the public would be taken under consideration.
In June 2019, the British Embassy in conjunction with the Solidarity Transport Hub Company held architectural workshops, inviting well-known architectural firms to share their preliminary concepts for what the project might look like. The studies are meant to serve as inspiration in preparing the master plan, and the investor is not obliged to use any of the designs. Terminal concepts were prepared by six top-name design studios: Foster+Partners, Grimshaw, Chapman Taylor, Zaha Hadid Architects, Benoy, Pascall+Watson:

Ann Hibner Koblitz

Ann Hibner Koblitz (born 1952) is a Professor Emerita of Women and Gender Studies at Arizona State University known for her studies of the history of women in science. She is the Director of the Kovalevskaia Fund, which supports women in science in developing countries.
Education and career.
She received her B.A. in history of science from Princeton University, where she was in the first class of women admitted as undergraduates. She earned her Ph.D. in history from Boston University. She studied and did research in the Soviet Union in 1974-75, 1978, 1981–82, 1985, and 1986. In 1984-85 she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, after which she had temporary teaching positions at Wellesley College, Oregon State University, and the University of Puget Sound. From 1989-98 she taught at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. Since 1998 she has been a professor at Arizona State University.
Controversies.
In a graduate seminar in 1977 Ann Hibner Koblitz criticized an article by political scientist Samuel Huntington for misusing mathematics in an attempt to buttress his arguments. This led her husband Neal Koblitz to include her critique in an article he wrote on "Mathematics as Propaganda," and this in turn inspired Yale mathematician Serge Lang to lead a campaign against the election of Huntington to the National Academy of Sciences. The journalist Charles Sykes, who describes the episode in detail in his book "Profscam", writes that
Despite the vigorous defense of Huntington by Nobel Prize winning economist Herbert Simon, Lang's campaign was successful, and Huntington was twice voted down by the Academy's members.
In the 1980s and 1990s Koblitz was a critic of the gender essentialism of Evelyn Fox Keller, who maintained that modern science is inherently patriarchal and ill-suited for women. Koblitz argued that Keller failed to appreciate the multi-faceted nature of scientific research and the great diversity of experiences of women across cultures and time periods. For example, in the 19th century the first women to earn advanced university degrees in Europe in any field were almost all in the natural sciences and medicine. In an article about the first 20 years of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), the mathematician and former AWM president Lenore Blum wrote
In the 1990s and early 2000s a group of archaeologists, led by Steven A. LeBlanc of Harvard, popularized the notion that warfare was endemic among all prehistoric peoples. Koblitz analyzed the writings of this group, compared them to other sources, and concluded that the claim of pervasive warfare among the ancient Hohokam people of present-day central Arizona is a modern "masculinist narrative" that has little support in the archaeological record. After speaking at the Old Pueblo Archaeology Center near Tucson, Arizona, Koblitz was asked to write a version of her "Men and Masculinities" article for the Center's "Bulletin". In that article she wrote:
Philanthropy.
In 1985 Koblitz and her husband Neal established the Kovalevskaia Fund as a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to support and encourage women in developing countries in science, mathematics, engineering, and medicine. It was originally aimed at promoting women in the sciences in Vietnam; it grew out of Ann's work on the history of women and science, her and Neal's experience in the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and their efforts to help promote science in Vietnam afterwards. Grants were at first made solely in Vietnam, but were eventually extended to other developing countries.

Kanai Yoshiko

Kanai Yoshiko (, born 1944) is Japanese academic and feminist theorist. She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by dualistic definitions of gender. Coining the phrase "housewife feminism", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.
Early life.
Kanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. She graduated from the University of Tokyo (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.
Career.
Kanai began her career at the newly established Nagaoka Women's Junior College in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on women's studies. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at Yokohama National University in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at Rissho University, from which she retired in 2015. 
Kanai was most known as a specialist in gender studies and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations. She coined the phrase "housewife feminism" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying systemic biases. She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of identity politics on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them. In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a binary gender model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife. By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues. She has noted that the failure to grasp that "…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.

Hayal Pozanti

Hayal Pozanti (born 1983, Istanbul, Turkey) is a Turkish-born artist, based in the United States. She is known for her large scale, brightly colored, seemingly abstract and geometric paintings, that represent statistical data related to human-computer interaction. 
Life and work.
Hayal Pozanti studied visual arts and visual communication design at Sabancı University in Istanbul and went on to study at Yale University, receiving a M.F.A. in painting and printmaking in 2011. Her work is informed by her ongoing exploration of "cyborg anthropology", which she describes as "a framework for understanding the effects of technology on human beings and culture".
Her work "Ciphers" (2015) was a direct rendering of data into a glyph alphabet, and limiting herself to the creation of 31 characters. The paintings from "Ciphers" (2015) feature layered abstractions of the shapes, and were displayed in the gallery with abstract sculptures of similar shapes. 
Pozanti revisited this theme of alphabet in her work named "Instant Paradise" (2017), where again she has invented alphabet of 31 shapes. This lexicon is the source material for her paintings, sculptures, animations and sound pieces. Each shape in Instant Paradise has been assigned a number and a letter from the English alphabet, allowing her to literally 'translate' information through a personalized encryption system. She has created a typeface from her characters, as well as phonemes that she resources for her animations and her sound pieces, respectively. 
Pozanti's work is in several public collections, including Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, JP Morgan, Fidelity Investments, and the San Jose Museum of Art.
Exhibitions.
Group exhibitions.
Pozanti's work has been featured in group exhibitions at Public Art Fund, Brooklyn Academy of Music, The Kitchen, MCA Santa Barbara, Cornell Fine Arts Museum, and the Sabanci Museum, Istanbul.

Life in Detail

"Life in Detail" is a song by the English vocalist Robert Palmer, released in 1990 as a promotional single from the soundtrack of the American romantic comedy film "Pretty Woman". The song was written by Palmer and Allen Powell, and produced by Palmer. It reached No. 7 on the US "Billboard" Album Rock Tracks, and No. 34 on the Canadian "RPM" Top Singles Chart.
"Life in Detail" had been written exclusively for the film. Powell had previously been the drummer in Vinegar Joe, which Palmer fronted, in the early 1970s. Following the band's split, Palmer and Powell continued their friendship and would write a number of songs together which Palmer recorded. According to "Manchester Evening News", "Life in Detail" allowed him to buy a 40-foot sail boat to live on, which he had moored at Sausalito, California.
Critical reception.
Upon release, the "Nanaimo Daily News" described the song as a "thumping jumper". "The Clarion-Ledger" noted: "The driving "Life in Detail" is only slightly less irresistible than Palmer's previous chartbusters". Paul Sinclair of "Super Deluxe Edition" described the song as a "relative obscurity from the soundtrack of the film "Pretty Woman"".

Dre'Mont Jones

Dre'Mont Jones (born January 5, 1997) is an American football defensive end for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Ohio State.
High school career.
Jones was named first-team Division-I All-Ohio and U.S. Army All-American as a senior, and graduated from Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland) in 2015. He was a four star recruit, ranked #7 in the state of Ohio and #170 in the nation. On June 18, 2014 he committed to Ohio State University to continue his football career.
College career.
For his first year of eligibility in 2015, Jones redshirted as a true freshman. During his redshirt freshman season in 2016, Jones joined Dan Wilkinson and Luke Fickell as the only freshmen defensive linemen to start 10 or more games in a season. By the end of the season, Jones racked up 52 total tackles, including 4 tackles for a loss. He earned Freshman All-America honors from the Football Writers Association of America.
Jones slightly regressed during his sophomore season in 2017, but still, put up strong numbers. He finished the season with 20 total tackles, including 5 tackles for a loss and one sack. He was selected to the third-team All-Big Ten. After his sophomore season, there was speculation that Jones would declare for the 2018 NFL Draft, with draft analyst Mel Kiper listing him as the 8th best draft-eligible defensive tackle. Despite this speculation, Jones decided to return to school for his junior season.
Projected first round pick Nick Bosa went down with an injury against TCU on September 15, leading Jones to take on a larger role on the defensive line. Jones started all 14 games as a redshirt junior for Ohio State, and was selected to the first-team All-Big Ten Conference after breaking out with 8.5 sacks and 43 tackles. Jones became the first defensive lineman in OSU history to score two defensive touchdowns in a single season in 2018. After the season, Jones decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2019 NFL Draft.
Professional career.
Jones was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round (71st overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft.
In week 11 against the Minnesota Vikings, Jones recorded his first career sack on Kirk Cousins in the 27–23 loss.
In week 13 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Jones recorded an interception off Philip Rivers and returned it for 7 yards in the 23–20 win. This was Jones' first interception in the NFL. In week 16 against the Detroit Lions, Jones sacked fellow rookie David Blough 2.5 times during the 27–17 win. As a result of his performance, Jones won the AFC Defensive Player of the Week, the third Broncos player ever to win the award as a rookie.
On September 22, 2020, Jones was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury. He was activated on October 24.
In Week 7 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Jones recorded his first sack of the season on Patrick Mahomes during the 43–16 loss.

Philip Joiner

Philip Joiner was a delegate to the 1867 constitutional convention in Georgia and an elected representative to the Georgia Assembly in 1868. He and other African Americans were prohibited from taking office by their colleagues in the Georgia Assembly. Federal intervention in 1870 overruled the discriminatory exclusion, and Joiner would win re-election to a second term in office. 
A month after being barred from taking office he was a leader of a march from Albany, Georgia to Camilla, Georgia. Participants were shot at and attacked at the Republican campaign rally in Camilla, including by the sheriff. Joiner submitted his testimony on the event to the Freedmen Bureau's O.H. Howard. Many were killed and wounded in the attack on freedmen. It was commemorated 100 years after it happened as the Camilla massacre.

2011 CIS University Cup

The 2011 CIS Men's University Cup Hockey Tournament (49th Annual) was held March 24–27, 2011. It was the first year of a two-year CIS Championship bid won by University of New Brunswick and hosted at their on-campus hockey rink - Aitken University Centre. The defending champions were St. Mary's Huskies, who won their 1st title in team history the previous year in Saskatoon. There would be a new champion this season as SMU was unsuccessful in advancing to the event.
Similar to previous years, going back to the introduction of the expanded format in 1998, the six invited teams were split into two(2) Pools of three(3) where each team plays the other(two games total). The best team in each Pool advances to the final. All pool games must be decided by a win, there are no ties. If a pool has a three-way tie for 1st (all teams have 1-1 records) than GF/GA differential among the tied teams is the first tie-breaker.
University Cup.
The six teams to advance to the tournament are listed below. The wild-card team was selected from the CW Conference as the OUA was provided the wild-card in 2010 and AUS teams are ineligible as they are the host conference. To avoid having St.FX in the same pool as UNB and Western in the same pool as McGill, the two teams were swapped.
Championship Final.
Bench assignments for the championship final is based on each advancing team's record and stats in their 2 pool games, not their tournament seed. UNB was determined the home team with a record of 2-0 (4pts) and a GF/GA of 6/1 = 6.0 versus McGill with the same record but a GF/GA of 8/4 = 2.0.
Tournament All-Stars.
Luke Gallant, a defenceman from the UNB Varsity Reds, was selected as the Major W.J. 'Danny' McLeod Award for CIS University Cup MVP. He led all players at the tournament with seven points (2+5=7) in three games including an assist on Josh Kidd's game-winning goal with 4.1 seconds remaining in a 2-1 victory over Calgary in their first game on Thursday. Plus back-to-back game-winners in a 4-0 shutout of Western on Saturday and a 4-0 victory of second-ranked McGill in Sunday's national final. Gallant earned Game-MVP honours against both Western and McGill following a pair of three-point performances.
Joining Gallant on the tournament all-star team were:&lt;br&gt;
Forward: Kyle Bailey (UNB Varsity Reds)&lt;br&gt;
Forward: Chris Culligan (UNB Varsity Reds)&lt;br&gt;
Forward: Maxime Langelier-Parent (McGill Redmen)&lt;br&gt;

Western Union Building (Aberdeen, South Dakota)

The Western Union Building, formerly known as the Hagerty Block and currently as the Dacotah Prairie Museum, is a historic bank building in Aberdeen, South Dakota. It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a contributing property to the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District.
History.
The Northwestern National Bank formed in Aberdeen in 1888 with Henry Marple as president. In August 1888, the bank purchased the property and general store at 21–23 South Main Street to build a new bank building. Construction took place from 1888 through 1889 with the bank opening in the new location in February 1889. In May 1891, a fire damaged the building and gutted the Kearney and Boyer grocery store. In March 1903, another fire damaged the building, originating in the basement banana room of the Gamble &amp; Robinson grocery store.
The building was purchased by Jay Hagerty in 1907, becoming known as the Hagerty Block. In 1920, existing tenant Western Union took over the most prominent space in the building, which then became known as the Western Union Building. Over the years, aside from the bank, the building housed grocery stores and several offices. In 1970, the building was donated to Brown County for a museum, which opened as the Dacotah Prairie Museum that October. By 1980 the museum was the sole occupant of the building.
The building was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places as the only remaining 19th century bank building in Aberdeen; it was listed on December 12, 1976. The building is also listed on the National Register as a key contributing property of the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District; the district was listed on May 23, 1988.
Architecture.
The Western Union Building is an example of Romanesque Revival architecture. The structure is a three-story building made of red brick laid in running bond. There are three main entrances, each framed by a large arch and set a few steps above street level. Pilasters extend the full height of the building, separating windows on the first floor and window pairs on the second and third floors. The interior has undergone renovations, but the exterior has changed little over the building's history.

Brown Betty (horse)

Brown Betty (known in the United States as Brown Betty II, 1930 – after 1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. She was one of the best of an exceptional crop of juvenile fillies in 1932 when she won her last four races including the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following spring he recorded her biggest victory when she took the 1000 Guineas. She ran disappointingly when fourth in the Epsom Oaks but went on to win the Richemount Stakes and finished second in both the Nassau Stakes and the Park Hill Stakes. She was retired from racing at the end of her second season and exported to become a broodmare in the United States.
Background.
Brown Betty was a bay or brown mare with a white star bred in the United Kingdom by Sir Alec Black. As a yearling she was offered for sale and bought for 1,600 guineas by Cecil Boyd-Rochfort on behalf of the American banker William Woodward Sr.. The filly was taken into training by Boyd-Rochfot at his Feemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Woodward reportedly named Brown Betty after Boyd-Rochfort's niece, Betty McCall. Physically, Brown Betty was described as "a filly of exquisite quality, of great length without being long in the back, and of a hard,dark bay colour that adds materially to her beauty." The French trainer Frank Carter described her as the finest looking filly he had ever seen.
She was sired by George V's stallion Friar Marcus who won the Middle Park Stakes in 1914 and went on to become a successful sprinter. Brown Betty was his only classic winner although he was the damsire of Bahram. Her dam Garpal was a granddaughter of Santa Brigida (foaled 1898), a British broodmare who was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Alcibiades, Mid-day Sun and Sun Stream. Garpal was bought by Alec Black for 3100 guineas from he breeder Lord Derby but sustained a fractured pelvis shortly afterwards and narrowly avoided being euthanised owing to the intervention of a veterinary surgeon.
Racing career.
1932: two-year-old season.
Brown Betty began her racing career by finishing second to Nun's Veil in the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July. In the Molecomb Stakes on heavy ground at Goodwood, she was beaten three lengths by Lord Astor's filly Betty, but a week later she reversed the form by beating Betty a length in a race at Nottingham. On her next two starts the filly was successful in the Champion Beeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse and a Rous Memorial at Newmarket. On her final start of the season Brown Betty was ridden by Joe Childs in the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket and won from Solftara at odds of 2/1. The victory took her winnings for the year to £4198.
The 1932 Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, was unique in that fillies filled the top three places: Myrobella topped the list with 133 pounds ahead of Betty (130) with Brown Betty third on 129.
1933: three-year-old season.
On 29 April Brown Betty, with Childs again in the saddle, started at odds of 8/1 in a 22-runner field for the 120th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. She won by half a length from Fur Tor with the favoured Myrobella three quarters of a length away in third.
Brown Betty was strongly fancied for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 2 June but apparently failed to stay the distance and came home fourth behind Chatelaine, Solfatara and Fur Tor. Brown Betty finished second to Solfatara in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and then returned to winning form to take the Richemount Stakes over ten furlongs at Hurst Park. In the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse she was "nursed" though the race by Childs in an attempt to preserve her stamina but was outstayed in the closing stages and beaten a neck by Typhonic.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Brown Betty an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
At the end of her racing career, Brown Betty was taken to the United States by Woodward to become a broodmare. She produced at least two foals:

Gathering of personally identifiable information

The gathering of personally identifiable information (PII) is the practice of collecting public and private personal data that can be used to identify an individual for both legal and illegal applications. PII owners often view PII gathering as a threat and violation of their privacy. Meanwhile, entities such as information technology companies, governments, and organizations use PII for data analysis of consumer shopping behaviors, political preference, and personal interests.
With the development of new information technology, PII is easier to access and share than before. The use of smartphones and social media has contributed to the widespread usage of PII gathering. PII is collected anywhere and anytime. The dissemination of personal data makes PII gathering a hotly debated social issue.
Recent illegal PII gathering by data collection companies, such as Cambridge Analytica on Facebook of over 87 million users, has caused increasing concern over privacy violation and has renewed call for more comprehensive data protection laws. Major security breaches at Equifax, Target, Yahoo, Home Depot, and the United States Office of Personnel Management impacted personal and financial information of millions of American, with calls for increasing information technology security and protection of PII data by businesses and governmental agencies.
Definition.
There is no precise definition for PII gathering. According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), PII is defined as:
(1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records and 
(2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial and employment information.
PII gathering is any activity that collects, organizes, manipulates, analyzes, exchanges, or shares this data.
Collectors.
Governments.
Governments publicly collect PII to extend social and legal benefits, such as improving social services and when fulfilling legal obligations.
Depending on a country's governmental archetype, such as democratic or authoritarian, PII gathering is conducted using different methods. Regardless, countries share similar goals with PII gathering, as demonstrated by the example below.
United States.
In the United States, PII is gathered through application for assistance, registration of property, tax filing, registration for selective services, application for driver's license, government employment, professional licensure, and other voluntary and mandatory information submission. PII is stored, accessed, and shared between different levels of government, departments, agencies, non-governmental entities, and the public. For example, a potential home buyer can look up if a real estate agent is licensed or not. The Government also gathers PII for crime prevention and national security purposes. Many of the programs are highly controversial among the US public. For example, the National Security Agency (NSA) collects and analyzes PII, including phone calls, emails, and social media interactions, from large numbers of people to uncover potential threats.
China.
The Chinese government has made big data part of the governance strategy. The goal is a more efficient and transparent government through the use of digital technology. The government has implemented one of the most technologically advanced surveillance networks on the planet called the “Skynet(天网监控系统)”. The system adopts artificial intelligence including facial recognition. 20 million cameras were installed to cover nearly every single public space in the country. PII protection in China deals with collection by private companies and organizations. There has been no discussion or proposal about limiting government involvement in collecting, gathering, and analyzing PII.
Finland.
Even in western democratic systems, there are different constraints on PII gathering. Nations in the European Union adopt stricter regulation on PII collecting than the United States. Similarly, personal data processing in Finland has been protected under comprehensive regulations and laws. The Personal Data Act in 1999 was the main national privacy regulation alongside the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive. Other data regulations enacted in Finland include the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Electronic Communication, the Act on the Protection of Privacy in Working Life, and the Act on the Openness of Governmental Activities. The Personal Data Act was replaced by European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will take effect in May 2018. Enforcement of privacy regulations have gotten stricter in recent years after a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights which found that a Finnish hospital failed to safeguard personal data.
Companies.
With the rapid growth and development of Internet and mobile technologies, private companies are able to collect personal data more quickly and effectively than before. Companies gather PII by storing of profile information when users register a new account, tracking user's location, tracking user's local storage, and using cookies and other anonymous identifiers.
Data brokers, also known as information brokers, are the major dealers of gathering, transforming, packaging, and selling of personal data. They gather PII from these resources: 1) Government documents and records, e.g. registration information, crime records. 2) Publicly available sources: including social media, blogs, and Internet websites. For example, Facebook users frequently post their personal information online and share their preferred links. As the site requires users to register with their real identities as required, it offers the opportunity for data broker to store and analyze the individual's personality and preference. 3) Approved companies, businesses, or services that are authorized by users willingly or sometime unknowingly to access their personal profiles. Similarly, online users are often asked to provide PII in order to register an account on a website. The website will then inform users about data gathering and benefits of storing the data, such as no need to enter the password every time and more effective on personal advertisements. However, these approved companies would sell PII collected and stored to data broker and mostly without users’ knowledge or consent. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data breach is an example. Cambridge Analytica traced personality traits from potential voters’ activities on Facebook, such as their “likes” and locations, and used this personal information to predict voting behaviors. Cambridge Analytica acquired over 87 million users’ PII. Only about 270,000 consented for their data for academic uses, while all other users’ PII is collected illegally by Cambridge Analytica.
Hackers.
Hackers are individuals or organizations that collect PII data illegally. They are driven mostly by financial interests, but sometimes political, such as the hacking of Sony by North Korean hackers. Hackers from North Korea targeted Sony Pictures in retaliation for the planned release of “The Interview,” a movie about the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The incident resulted in the release of Social Security numbers, salary information, and medical records of Sony employees. Hackers use spyware, viruses, backdoors, social engineering or other methods to steal and collect PII data from individuals, companies, governments, and other organization. For example, Equifax, one of the largest credit company in the world, its security was compromised by hackers and PII for millions of Americans was stolen.
Related laws.
PII gathering is often associated with violation of privacy and is often opposed by privacy advocates. Democratic countries, such as the United States and those in the European Union have more developed privacy laws against PII gathering. Laws in the European Union offer more comprehensive and uniform protection of personal data. In the United States, federal data protection laws are approached by sectors. Authoritarian countries often lack PII gathering protection for citizens. For example, Chinese citizens enjoy legislative protection against private companies, but have no protection from government violation.
European Union.
The GDPR will take effect on May 25, 2018 and offers comprehensive privacy protection consistent across all sectors and industries. The regulation applies to all businesses and government agencies in the European Union countries. It also regulates all foreign companies and organizations offering services in Europe. Violation and non-compliance of the GDPR may result in penalties up 4 percent of the business’ worldwide annual revenue. GDPR requires businesses and government agencies to get consent for data processing, make anonymous of collected data, provide quick notifications for data breach, safe handling of data transfer across borders, and appointment of data protection officer.
United States.
The section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) is used to make companies safeguard collected PII data. A company in the United States is not required to have a privacy policy, but is obliged to comply if the company disclosed a privacy policy. The company also cannot retroactively change its data collection policy without offering an opportunity for users to opt out. The FTC imposed a $100 million penalty on LifeLock for failure to protect customer's PII data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers, and violated the terms of a 2010 federal court order.
The FTC also uses the Behavioral Advertising Principe to provide guidelines and suggestions for website operators on data collection practices, activity tracking, and opt-out mechanism. A website operator is requested to obtain express consent before sensitive PII data, such as social security numbers, financial data, health information, and data of minors can collected and used. The Behavioral Advertising Principe also calls for reasonable security to protect the collected personal data and limited length of data retention, but for as long as is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business or law enforcement need. The principle is also self-regulatory and intended to encourage more discussion and further development by all interested parties.
Concerns.
PII gathering is usually viewed by the public as a violation of privacy. A major concern is that PII gathering allows for the classification of individual and groups, which leads to discrimination and loss of individual and collective freedom. Other perceived risks include: “(1) monetary risk is the risk associated with potential financial loss, (2) social risk is the risk associated with threats to an individual’s self-esteem, reputation, and/or the perceptions of others, (3) physical risk is the risk associated with bodily injury, and (4) psychological risk is the risk associated with potential negative emotions such as anxiety, distress, and/or conflicts with self-image.”
A 2018 Gallup poll indicated that more people are now concerned with invasion of privacy and data gathering after the revelation that personal data of Facebook users was collected and shared with Cambridge Analytica without consent. The survey showed that 43% of Facebook users are “very concerned” compared to 30% in 2011, with similar responses from Google users. There is also increasing concerns that personal data is being collected even if users are not logged in or not using the services. The data is collected to target users with tailored advertising services. Concerns over unauthorized data collection and use has resulted in many users stopping using Facebook or moving to other social media platforms, with increasing call for broad privacy regulation from the government, including the ability for users opt out of data collection completely.

He was elected president of the Trade Union Association of Military and Police Employees ("Fegyveres és Rendvédelmi Dolgozók Érdekvédelmi Szövetsége", FRDÉSZ) in 1998. He also served as co-president of the Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Liga) from 2005 to 2008. Under his presidency, the FRDÉSZ strongly opposed the amendment of the work code, the termination of private pension system and the revision of the military life model by the Second Orbán Government since 2010. Kónya resigned from that position on 1 December 2011, when entered political sphere.
Kónya was a founding member and inaugural president of the Hungarian Solidarity Movement (Solidarity) in October 2011. It was a social and trade union movement, based on the Polish Solidarity. When former prime minister Gordon Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the One Million for Press Freedom (Milla), the Solidarity also supported his efforts and joined his electoral cooperation named Together 2014. The movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, as only parties could take part in the upcoming election according to the rules. Three co-presidents were elected: Viktor Szigetvári (Patriotism and Progress Association), Péter Kónya (Solidarity) and Péter Juhász (Milla).
Kónya was elected Member of Parliament from the national list of the Unity electoral alliance in the 2014 national election. As an officially independent MP, he became a member of the Agriculture Committee. Solidarity left the Together party in February 2015, because disagreed with the party's internal integration and abolition of the Together's coalition platform system which led to the formation of an unified image party. Its president Kónya also left Together, but retained his parliamentary mandate. Kónya and his some followers left the Hungarian Solidarity Movement in October 2015 in order to establish a political party. He founded the Solidarity for Republic Party (SZKP) in February 2016. Nevertheless, the party, if ever existed, did not participate in the 2018 parliamentary election, thus Kónya lost his parliamentary seat.

Cuniptau Mines

Cuniptau Mines (a combination of the symbols Cu, Ni, Pt and Au) was a Canadian mining company from 1933 to 1937. It was incorporated in December 1933 under the leadership of B. W. Watkins with its headquarters based in Toronto, Ontario. The company was engaged in development of the Cuniptau Mine, a polymetallic ore deposit in Strathy Township of Northeastern Ontario. In later years Cuniptau Mines also acquired the Alexo Mine property in Clergue and Dundonald townships of Cochrane District.
History and operations.
Development of the Cuniptau Mine began in 1933 with the sinking of a shaft and underground drifting on the shaft level. This was followed by deepening of the shaft to , a new level established at , drifting, crosscutting and raising in 1934. Operations in 1935 were confined mostly to surface mineral exploration. In 1936, the smelter was rebuilt to test out the possibilities of making a suitable matte from the mined ore. High-grade quartz vein material from the Cuniptau Silica Deposit in Best Township was used as flux for the ore smelting. Development of the Cuniptau Mine in 1936 consisted of underground drifting, crosscutting and raising, with exploration confined to surface and underground diamond drilling. The mine office was stationed at Goward, a locality now in the municipality of Temagami.
Cuniptau Mines reopened the Alexo Mine near Porquis Junction in 1936. Operations at this mining property during the year consisted of partial mine dewatering and sampling. The company shipped two cars of ore from Alexo to the Cuniptau Mine to increase the nickel content of the material being smelted.
On January 10, 1937, the shareholders of Cuniptau Mines ratified a proposal to merge the company with the newly formed Ontario Nickel Corporation. Ontario Nickel acquired the Cuniptau and Alexo mines in 1937 from this merge.

James M. Simms

James Merilus Simms (December 27, 1823, Savannah, Georgia – July 9, 1912, Savannah) was an African-American minister, newspaper publisher, author, and elected representative in the Georgia Assembly during the Reconstruction Era.
Simms was born a slave in Savannah, Georgia. A carpenter by trade, he bought his freedom in 1857. In around 1864, having been condemned for teaching slaves, he was sentenced to be publicly whipped and fined $100. He left Savannah for Boston and became a chaplain in the Union Army, later returning to his home district. Simms may have been the same person as the James M. Symms whose company published an edition of "The Black Man" in 1863.
Simms and his African-American colleagues in the Georgia Assembly were prohibited from taking office after a vote by their colleagues. Federal intervention in 1870 overturned the discriminatory action. He wrote about his church's history in Savannah, Georgia.
In 1870, he supported the Baptist minister and Assembly delegate Ulysses L. Houston in occupying the Bryan County Baptist Church, which had been taken over by his rival Alexander Harris; for their role in this protest, Houston and Simms were both arrested.

Change His Ways

"Change His Ways" is a song by English vocalist Robert Palmer, released in 1989 as the fifth single from his ninth studio album "Heavy Nova". The song was written and produced by Palmer. "Change His Ways" reached No. 28 in the UK.
A music video, featuring the use of animation and cartoon characters designed by the Italian artist and cartoonist Massimo Mattioli, was filmed to promote the single. The video parodies the highly successful Terence Donovan-directed videos for "Addicted to Love", "I Didn't Mean to Turn You On" and "Simply Irresistible" by replacing the backing models with caricature animated birds. The song itself features yodelling and Zydeco accordion.
Release.
"Change His Ways" was released by EMI on 7" vinyl in the UK, Europe and Australasia. 12" vinyl and CD formats were issued in the UK and Europe, while a limited edition 7" picture disc was released in the UK. All 7" editions featured the B-side "More Than Ever", which also appeared on "Heavy Nova".
Critical reception.
Upon release, "People" commented on the song: "It starts out with a South African tinge then drifts through a reggae mood, a Louisiana riff or two, some mundane pop and, saints preserve, a snatch of yodeling. This is one of those notions that reads better than it sounds, and it doesn't read all that amusingly".

Deco Labels

Deco Labels and Flexible Packaging Limited (also known as Deco Labels and Tags) is a Canadian label company, specializing in pressure-sensitive labels for plastic-wrapped grocery products, and based in Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada. It is primarily known for its association with the Ford family of Ontario politicians, including Member of Provincial Parliament Doug Ford Sr., Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, and Ontario PC Party Leader and Premier of Ontario Doug Ford Jr. It has annual sales of approximately $100 million per year.
History.
Deco was founded in 1962, by Doug Ford Sr. and Ted Herriott. The company was originally a Toronto location for Avery labels, but quickly separated from its parent company. In 1965, Herriott left the company, over a dispute whether it should expand into the tag business. In the following years, it experienced significant growth and success, under the leadership of Doug Sr.
In the 1995, Doug Sr. became MPP for Etobicoke—Humber, and his sons Doug Ford Jr. and Randy Ford assumed control for day-to-day operations of the company. In 1999, the company opened a branch in Chicago, led by Doug Jr. The branch eventually achieved $11 million in annual sales. Further, less successful operations in Ohio and Florida followed. In 2002, Doug Jr. became president of the company, replacing his father. In 2006, Doug Sr., nearing his death, divided up the company, leaving 40% to Doug Jr, 40% to Randy and 20% to Rob Ford (the third brother).
In 2008, Deco purchased Wise Tag and Label, a New Jersey tag business. The acquisition was not successful, and the firing of Wise Tag's manager led to a 2012 lawsuit. In 2010, Doug Jr. was elected Toronto City Councillor (replacing his brother Rob), and Randy took control of day-to-day operations of the company. Former Deco employees suggest that the company was well-managed under Doug Jr., but that the company declined under Randy's leadership. The Toronto division has also struggled to deliver orders on time.
In 2011, Doug Jr. and Rob allegedly used their positions as city councilor and mayor to benefit Deco, in connection with two clients of the company, RR Donnelley and Apollo Health and Beauty Care. An investigation was launched in 2014, and concluded that Doug Jr. broke the code of conduct. In 2018, after being elected Ontario PC leader, Doug Jr. said that he would put his ownership stake in Deco in a trust if elected premier in the upcoming election.
In June 2018, Renata Ford, Rob Ford's widow, launched a $16.25 million lawsuit against Doug and Randy Ford, a few days before the provincial election in which Doug was elected premier. The lawsuit alleges that Doug and Randy were bad managers of Deco Labels, and were guilty of various financial improprieties in their role as trustees of Doug Sr's estate. According to the suit, Deco lost $5.5 million in the six years before 2018, from a total value of $10 million in 2006, due in part to various acquisitions. In order to shore up the company's finances, the lawsuit alleges that the Ford brothers sold other investments owned by Doug Sr's estate. As a result of these activities, the estate declined considerably in value, to the loss of Renata. Doug and Randy deny the allegations, suggesting that they are "completely false".
Business.
Deco specializes in producing labels for consumer products, especially in the grocery sector. It also produces labels for the City of Toronto government. Deco is headquartered in Rexdale, Ontario, with an American office near Chicago, Illinois. It has a 70,000-square foot production facility in Toronto, and a 45,000-square foot facility in Chicago, with a total of 200 employees.
 the company was jointly owned by Doug Ford Jr. and Randy Ford. According to the June 2018 lawsuit, Doug owned 100% of the Chicago branch, while Randy owned 100% of the Toronto branch. Regulatory filings by Doug Ford Jr. in May 2018 suggested that he was the sole owner of the "Deco Labels and Tags", also known as "Deco Chicago".

The Twelve Abbots of Challant

The Twelve Abbots of Challant () is an historical novel by Laura Mancinelli published in 1981 and winner of the Mondello Prize in the same year.
Translation in English - Sarah E. Christopher, Colleen Regalbuto
The story is set around the end of the 13th century in a castle perched in the mountains of the Aosta Valley and lasts a year, from the death of the old marquis to the fire in the castle. The only external environment is the wood; the internal environments are the rooms of the castle.
Plot summary.
A feudal lord inherits a castle with the condition of maintaining faith in an evil obligation of chastity. Twelve abbots take on the task of watching over the commitment, but they all disappear in a succession of mysterious deaths, victims of banal and emblematic incidents. Beautiful and unscrupulous Madonnas, castellans and priests, philosophers persecuted by the Inquisition, squires and monks, devils and sulphurous spells, testamentary readings and carnal temptations, audacious and holy tetragons and then again ... the beautiful Maravì sleepless in love, nostalgia, evening horseback riding, inventors and transplant surgeons in the odor of heresy and even a child and his cat Miro.
In the novel many characters are presented, some appearing only in one chapter (like the merchant, the inventor, the astrologer), others who return after some time for a brief appearance (like the troubadour and the philosopher). Each of them represents a social class of the Middle Ages.
Characters.
Protagonist of the story together with the marquise. Blond, slim, with blue eyes. For these reasons he should have been (and perhaps even wanted to be) a minstrel, not to mention that he enjoyed composing songs with his viola. He had regretted signing the will, not only because he had to remain chaste, but also because he was incapable of administering a territory, with all its attendant hassles. But he had accepted because it seemed bad not to accept, because that is the way it is usually done; why, he did not know himself. Perpetually in love, even though he did not know how to love. Jealous of all the castle guests who courted Madonna Bianca di Challant, so much so that he threw out the troubadour.
Very beautiful woman, loved by many, including the duke, the philosopher, the troubadour and Abbot Mistral. She used to go out on horseback in the evening before sunset. Sometimes he rode Hippomenes, a proud white horse with a slow and solemn trot; sometimes he rode Yvars, a black, agile, nervous and quick horse. With Ippomele she wore all white: white was her cloak, white her veil, white was the big hat placed on her veil; with Yvars, instead, she wore all black. But she was beautiful on both occasions.
An inventor arrives at the castle in a cart mounted on a sledge and pulled by two horses to sell his products. He leaves Abbot Nevoso a spring-loaded sleigh, where, unable to use it, he dies.
He arrived at the castle on a horse, wearing a cloak that covered him completely and also a pointed hat, which students usually wear, adorned with two very long and wavy feathers: one green-yellow cockerel and one very candid swan. Graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris, he was expelled from the city accused of heresy, because with his thought and the basis of Abelard, a philosopher who was also a heretic, he had, in a certain way, given the doctrine of Mohammed as being equally valid.
She wore a long, feathered cape that went down from his head, which was fitted with a sort of hood, to his feet, enveloping his robust body in its breadth and hiding his tawny, frizzy hair.
Came from the Angevin Court of Naples. She had curly auburn hair and fell in love with Messer Goffredo da Salerno. In order to seduce him, she decided to dress in a cherry-red satin dress, edged at the neckline and sleeves: the red of the dress accentuated the red of her hair and the whiteness of her neck and breasts, which generously appeared from the wide neckline. But Goffredo wanted nothing to do with her; he even avoided her. So Maravì fell ill: red, slightly swollen eyes, chapped lips and a shabby hairstyle were the symptoms of the love disease. When, blinded by rage, she had thrown a large chess piece out of the window at a man who appeared to her to be Goffredo, she had killed Abbot Foscolo.
He was an imposing man, perhaps in his fifties, with traces of recent beauty in his noble face and expressive eyes. He was dressed in long black velvet stockings over which fell a large red cloth jacket, the folds of which were held in place at the waist by a high belt; over this he wore a short cape, black like his stockings, and very large. His clothing showed that he was a man accustomed to the affluence of Venice at that time.

Mary Florence MacDonald

Mary Macdonald (September 10, 1984 – July 18, 2017), born in Truro, Nova Scotia, was a Canadian artist and independent curator based in St. John’s (Newfoundland and Labrador), who left a lasting impact on the arts and cultural community of Atlantic Canada, and advocated for the promotion of emerging artists and cultural workers in the region.
Career.
Mary MacDonald began her arts career as a university student in the Fine Arts program at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. During this time, MacDonald became involved with Struts Gallery and Faucet Media Arts Centre, a local artist-run-centre dedicated to the promotion of emerging visual arts practices and critically engaged contemporary art.
After graduating in 2006, MacDonald participated in the critically acclaimed internship program at the Owens Art Gallery in Sackville, under the tutelage of Director Gemey Kelly. Following this appointment, MacDonald moved to St. John’s in 2008 and began working with Eastern Edge Gallery as Assistant Director until 2010. She then pursued a Masters in Curatorial Studies at OCAD University in Toronto, graduating in 2012. MacDonald returned to St. John’s to assume the role of executive director at Eastern Edge Gallery, where she worked until 2015.
During her time as executive director, MacDonald also contributed to the community of St. John’s through independent projects, and volunteer work (for example, MacDonald was the founder of the St. John’s based Girls Rock NL, which seeks to empower self-identified girls and female youth with access to the arts and music programming). Most recently, MacDonald was a curator for Flotilla, "the first transnational gathering focusing on nomadic and temporary elements of contemporary artist-run culture in Atlantic Canada", held in Charlottetown, PEI in September 2017.
MacDonald received critical acclaim for her curatorial work. In 2016, her project "Land of Mirrors" was presented at Eastern Edge Gallery, and featured the work of Michael Flaherty, Will Gill, Philippa Jones, Jerry Ropson, and Jason Wells. As explained by author Lisa Moore in Canadian Art,
"There is a subtle ambiguity in the subtitle of this exhibition. It might mean that ongoing experiments are happening in Newfoundland, have always happened there, or it might mean that experiments are happening to the very thingness that is Newfoundland—or was Newfoundland...Either way, a wilful dreaming is evoked. Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured. The question also hints at the fanciful, mildly surreal aesthetic throughout the exhibit. MacDonald and the five artists, Will Gill, Jason Wells, Jerry Ropson, Michael Flaherty and Philippa Jones, are intent on exploring a new Newfoundland."
As a precursor to this exhibition, which considered regionalism, site, and rural art practices, was MacDonald’s project, "W(here) Festival," held in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. This project, completed during her graduate studies at OCADU, considered the importance and creative potential for curating within rural communities. As explained by MacDonald, the "W(here) Festival" occurred over five days and "included three visiting artist projects by Marlene Creates, Sheilah Wilson and Site Media Inc, four works by local artists drawn from a call for submissions by Susan Sellers, Raina McDonald, Sharon Nowlan, Linda Little and Sheree Fitch, seven presentations by additional local artists and one musical performance by Al Tuck".
In an essay to accompany the festival, MacDonald goes on to say:
"On a curatorial level, I argue that art practices and engagements in rural places teach us how to re-examine the familiar, re-imagine place and make change on a more human-scale. Projects tend to take a long time to develop here and their legacy felt long after. Unlike cities where 20 cultural products come and go almost on a daily basis, here change can be profound, slow and incredibly meaningful. In addition, projects out "here" can often be over looked, ephemeral. But indeed, the old divide between city and country is a tired one. Instead, the projects, stories and actions of the W(here) Festival suggest new simultaneous territories and methodologies that are rich and complex."
When writing about the "W(here) Festival" in her OCADU thesis paper, MacDonald included a dedication in which she stated: "To the communities of Pictou County this project is for you. May it encourage other artists and cultural organizers to be brave in places like yours and for others to listen". Such a statement communicates the heart of Mary MacDonald’s legacy in Atlantic Canada and nationally.
MacDonald contributed to a number of Arts magazines including "Visual Art News", "Cuss" (editor), "C Magazine", and "The Overcast".
Activism.
MacDonald campaigned against cuts to arts funding and spoke out about the value of artists' work and societal contributions throughout her professional career, such as publishing a list of artists who had left Newfoundland and Labrador in The Overcast newspaper, saying "this province lacks vision and the ability to retain young professionals." She spoke out against the Newfoundland and Labrador 2013 budget cuts that led to staffing losses at the St. John's-based museum and gallery The Rooms. That campaign included a public forum she co-organized to discuss the cuts titled "ART=WORK", a slogan she pioneered. Tshirts with the ART=WORK slogan have since been sold as fundraiser by the non-profit group Visual Artists of Newfoundland and Labrador, in partnership with the Mary MacDonald Foundation, with proceeds meant to support artists in the province.
Legacy.
MacDonald's death in July 2017 prompted the arts community of St. John’s and Atlantic Canada to reflect on her work, and her efforts to bring contemporary art to rural communities. As stated in a posthumous article in The Overcast (an alternative newspaper based out of St. John's ), Chad Pelley states that "She was the kind of bright realistic visionary that imparted critical thinking and influence into her community." In the same article, Pelley states "It isn’t even her astounding community impact a lot of us are taking note of and celebrating upon her death. Instead, it’s that light she had in her, that just went out on us all. Whatever that was, it’s something so rare we miss it already."
To commemorate her legacy, the Mary MacDonald Foundation has been established to support independent curatorial practices.
